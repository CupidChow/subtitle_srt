He's still asleep.

18
00:02:20,302 --> 00:02:20,942
We'll go up

19
00:02:21,022 --> 00:02:22,022
when he wakes up.

20
00:02:22,261 --> 00:02:23,261
Wait.

21
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:26,462
I tried really hard today.

22
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:29,021
Did I do something to upset you?

23
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:29,583
Come on.

24
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,141
I think I was doing okay.

25
00:02:31,221 --> 00:02:33,022
Or was I being too slick?

26
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:33,943
Weren't you

27
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:35,261
just disliking me?

28
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:36,342
My personality

29
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:37,181
is like this.

30
00:02:37,261 --> 00:02:39,381
If something occurs,
I tend to become very aggressive

31
00:02:39,381 --> 00:02:40,382
and unreasonable.

32
00:02:40,462 --> 00:02:41,022
While we still

33
00:02:41,102 --> 00:02:42,102
have not moved yet,

34
00:02:42,182 --> 00:02:43,542
you should think it over.

35
00:02:43,622 --> 00:02:45,261
If you can't accept it,

36
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:47,501
then let's think it over together

37
00:02:48,101 --> 00:02:49,541
to avoid any regret in the future.

38
00:02:49,941 --> 00:02:51,501
Wait, I...

39
00:02:51,622 --> 00:02:53,462
I intended to praise you.

40
00:02:54,101 --> 00:02:54,742
Your performance

41
00:02:54,822 --> 00:02:56,022
was really great today.

42
00:02:57,221 --> 00:02:58,822
And you didn't say a word.

43
00:02:58,902 --> 00:03:00,021
I thought you were afraid

44
00:03:00,101 --> 00:03:01,261
of waking the child.

45
00:03:01,661 --> 00:03:02,742
Really?

46
00:03:03,062 --> 00:03:04,062
Really.

47
00:03:04,622 --> 00:03:06,261
That move

48
00:03:06,381 --> 00:03:07,422
you just did today

49
00:03:07,582 --> 00:03:09,062
clearly showed you've practiced.

50
00:03:09,142 --> 00:03:09,943
Next time

51
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,221
you hit me, go easy on me.

52
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:13,701
Will you go up?

53
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:16,101
Not today.

54
00:03:16,582 --> 00:03:17,782
You should also rest well.

55
00:03:17,862 --> 00:03:18,362
I still

56
00:03:18,423 --> 00:03:19,742
have to deal with work.

57
00:03:19,902 --> 00:03:21,102
When you

58
00:03:21,182 --> 00:03:21,783
are available,

59
00:03:21,863 --> 00:03:23,501
I'll come to help you pack up and move.

60
00:03:26,261 --> 00:03:27,622
Oh, one more thing.

61
00:03:30,622 --> 00:03:31,622
I almost forgot.

62
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:34,742
(I'm a novice driver)
This thing is very important.

63
00:03:34,941 --> 00:03:35,861
Don't forget it.

64
00:03:35,941 --> 00:03:36,941
Come on.

65
00:03:37,221 --> 00:03:38,840
What do you mean by this?

66
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:53,784
(Be kind to novice driver)

67
00:03:56,574 --> 00:04:02,168
(Be tolerant to novice driver)

68
00:04:11,774 --> 00:04:12,600
(Novice driver)

69
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:16,381
Perfect.

70
00:04:19,102 --> 00:04:20,181
Isn't this a bit

71
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,261
too much?

72
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:23,821
By the way,

73
00:04:24,062 --> 00:04:24,662
the car key

74
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:25,742
is here.

75
00:04:26,782 --> 00:04:27,862
Safety first.

76
00:04:28,141 --> 00:04:29,501
I'm leaving, goodbye.

77
00:04:29,941 --> 00:04:30,662
Be careful.

78
00:04:30,742 --> 00:04:31,742
Okay.

79
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:10,662
Why are you cutting the line?

80
00:05:29,782 --> 00:05:30,741
What are you doing?

81
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:31,622
Pay or not?

82
00:05:31,742 --> 00:05:32,382
If not,

83
00:05:32,462 --> 00:05:33,501
step aside and make space.

84
00:05:58,302 --> 00:05:59,302
Qian Hao.

85
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,861
Stop right there.

86
00:06:00,941 --> 00:06:01,982
What do you want?

87
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:02,741
You're there

88
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:03,463
pitifully alone.

89
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:04,662
So, I help you pay.

90
00:06:06,422 --> 00:06:07,982
Hu Xiaojiao, are you crazy?

91
00:06:08,141 --> 00:06:09,261
You got itchy hands or what?

92
00:06:09,341 --> 00:06:10,941
After Xu Kaixin hit me, you hit me.

93
00:06:10,962 --> 00:06:11,462
How come?

94
00:06:11,462 --> 00:06:12,421
I've been nice to you?

95
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:13,501
You deserve it.

96
00:06:13,701 --> 00:06:14,821
We slapped you

97
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:16,102
because you're a bad person.

98
00:06:16,862 --> 00:06:17,821
I don't need your pity.

99
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:19,501
Who am I? I'm your wife.

100
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:21,821
You should love me and not pity me.

101
00:06:22,102 --> 00:06:22,941
Be quite.

102
00:06:23,021 --> 00:06:24,021
This is a hospital.

103
00:06:24,581 --> 00:06:26,062
Did you hear it? This is a hospital.

104
00:06:26,142 --> 00:06:27,381
Too many people, no time...

105
00:06:27,581 --> 00:06:28,381
Hu Xiaojiao.

106
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:29,261
Don't pull my tie.

107
00:06:29,461 --> 00:06:30,261
Let go.

108
00:06:30,422 --> 00:06:30,941
I said

109
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,982
I hate it when someone yanks my tie.

110
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:35,261
Qian Hao.

111
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:38,141
If you want to be bad to me,
then stick to it.

112
00:06:38,622 --> 00:06:39,382
Don't be nice to me

113
00:06:39,462 --> 00:06:40,462
when I want

114
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:41,463
to give up on you.

115
00:06:41,543 --> 00:06:42,782
You make letting go difficult.

116
00:06:43,862 --> 00:06:44,941
Can we not

117
00:06:45,021 --> 00:06:46,022
fight like this,

118
00:06:46,102 --> 00:06:47,381
and torment each other?

119
00:06:47,461 --> 00:06:49,941
I'm really going crazy.

120
00:06:50,742 --> 00:06:52,022
Every time I think of a divorce,

121
00:06:52,102 --> 00:06:52,783
and if I don't,

122
00:06:52,863 --> 00:06:54,302
then I'm just a fool.

123
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:55,421
When you're nice to me,

124
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:56,022
I wonder

125
00:06:56,102 --> 00:06:56,622
if it is

126
00:06:56,702 --> 00:06:57,982
just all temporary.

127
00:06:58,062 --> 00:06:59,022
You must love me.

128
00:06:59,102 --> 00:07:00,381
You must love me for sure.

129
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,581
It's just that you don't know it.

130
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:03,941
So, should I

131
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:05,102
hold on a little longer?

132
00:07:05,182 --> 00:07:05,783
Then will

133
00:07:05,863 --> 00:07:07,461
our ending be different?

134
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:08,901
But,

135
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:10,182
I really...

136
00:07:10,341 --> 00:07:12,301
I can't hold on any longer.

137
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:14,141
Qian Hao, I beg you.

138
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:15,501
You...

139
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:17,542
If you want to stab me to death,

140
00:07:17,622 --> 00:07:19,381
just stab me with one strike to the end.

141
00:07:19,701 --> 00:07:20,501
Or,

142
00:07:20,622 --> 00:07:22,501
we can forget all that,

143
00:07:22,982 --> 00:07:24,581
and be like we used to be.

144
00:07:26,302 --> 00:07:27,302
Is that okay?

145
00:07:30,422 --> 00:07:31,422
Is that okay?

146
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:36,343
When you were

147
00:07:36,423 --> 00:07:37,662
sleeping with other men,

148
00:07:37,742 --> 00:07:38,742
did you think of me?

149
00:07:54,381 --> 00:07:55,381
What are you doing?

150
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:56,581
Get out.

151
00:07:57,461 --> 00:07:58,461
Qian Hao.

152
00:07:59,422 --> 00:08:00,422
Qian Hao.

153
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:02,982
I'll go back to pack my things,

154
00:08:03,062 --> 00:08:04,422
and then I'll move out.

155
00:08:05,102 --> 00:08:06,102
Don't worry.

156
00:08:06,901 --> 00:08:08,741
Even if you beg me in the future,

157
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,622
I won't look back.

for letting me

171

come to my senses.

172
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:28,221
It's truly outrageous.

Keep your voice down.

174
00:09:32,062 --> 00:09:33,621
Look at this child,

175
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:34,941
who is so careless.

176
00:09:35,062 --> 00:09:36,822
He didn't even know he almost got lost,

177
00:09:36,902 --> 00:09:38,142
still having fun.

178
00:09:39,461 --> 00:09:40,941
It scares me to think about it.

179

A child at this age

180
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:44,221
can't be left unattended for a moment.

181
00:09:44,981 --> 00:09:46,621
Qian Hao is

182
00:09:46,782 --> 00:09:48,542
his biological father after all.

183
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:50,422
How can he be so careless?

184
00:09:51,461 --> 00:09:52,461
I think

185
00:09:52,581 --> 00:09:54,422
he's just taking Xiaomi back

186
00:09:54,502 --> 00:09:55,861
for his mother

187
00:09:55,941 --> 00:09:57,221
to fulfill her wishes.

188
00:09:57,542 --> 00:10:00,062
Xiaomi is used
as a tool for filial piety.

189
00:10:00,382 --> 00:10:01,902
Getting involved with this family

190
00:10:02,062 --> 00:10:03,262
never brings good news.

191
00:10:04,022 --> 00:10:05,261
The way Heaven creates people

192
00:10:05,341 --> 00:10:06,422
is truly interesting.

00:10:07,861 --> 00:10:08,942
is only reflected

195
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:10,741
on filial piety for his mother.

196
00:10:11,062 --> 00:10:12,062
I blame myself

197
00:10:12,142 --> 00:10:13,541
for never learning my lesson.

198
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:14,942
I thought that he could make up

199
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:15,902
for the lack

200
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,342
of paternal love for the kids.

201
00:10:17,422 --> 00:10:19,221
I'm really out of my mind.

202
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:21,101
However, I think,

203
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:22,303
this time, Qian Hao

204
00:10:22,383 --> 00:10:24,062
will definitely not give up easily.

205
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:26,101
We'll move immediately.

206
00:10:26,262 --> 00:10:27,462
Change Xiaomi's kindergarten.

207
00:10:27,542 --> 00:10:29,542
We'll do without his child support.

208
00:10:29,741 --> 00:10:31,461
Let's stay away from his family.

209
00:10:31,701 --> 00:10:32,701
You're right.

210
00:10:32,861 --> 00:10:33,583
After that thing,

211
00:10:33,663 --> 00:10:34,702
I finally understand

212
00:10:34,782 --> 00:10:36,182
that backing down won't help.

213
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:37,381
He is heartless towards us.

214
00:10:37,461 --> 00:10:38,941
We must act tough too.

215
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:40,221
I've decided.

216
00:10:40,382 --> 00:10:41,182
This time,

217
00:10:41,382 --> 00:10:43,101
we must take the initiative first.

218
00:10:43,262 --> 00:10:44,461
Take the initiative?

219
00:10:44,981 --> 00:10:46,022
What's your plan?

220
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:52,062
I haven't decided yet.

221
00:10:53,902 --> 00:10:55,621
You are bluffing.

222
00:10:56,142 --> 00:10:57,701
But losing morale is not an option.

223
00:10:58,621 --> 00:10:59,303
We

224
00:10:59,383 --> 00:11:00,821
have to show our spirit first.

225
00:11:12,581 --> 00:11:13,302
Dad.

226
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:14,382
Chengyi,

227
00:11:14,782 --> 00:11:16,062
you should come back today.

228
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:17,542
Come back earlier.

229
00:11:18,902 --> 00:11:19,902
Hey...

230
00:11:28,978 --> 00:11:31,672
(Mei Chengyi)

231
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:41,861
Honey.

232
00:11:43,142 --> 00:11:43,741
Honey.

233
00:11:43,821 --> 00:11:44,821
Locked.

234
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:48,262
Why are you shouting?

235
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:49,542
When you see me,

236
00:11:49,622 --> 00:11:50,701
you didn't even greet me.

237
00:11:52,662 --> 00:11:53,662
Xia Chunyan,

238
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:56,021
what are you doing at my house?

239
00:11:56,101 --> 00:11:57,101
Where's my wife?

240
00:11:57,542 --> 00:11:58,382
It's up to her.

241
00:11:58,462 --> 00:11:59,982
How would I know where she went?

242
00:12:00,062 --> 00:12:00,583
Besides,

243
00:12:00,663 --> 00:12:02,461
what do you mean
by "coming to your house"?

244
00:12:02,581 --> 00:12:03,343
When buying this,

245
00:12:03,423 --> 00:12:04,942
Mom contributed money.

246
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:06,101
So I have returned

247
00:12:06,182 --> 00:12:07,541
to my own home.

248
00:12:07,621 --> 00:12:08,941
Don't argue with me.

249
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:10,062
We parted ways

250
00:12:10,142 --> 00:12:11,142
a while ago.

251
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:12,382
Tell me

252
00:12:12,462 --> 00:12:13,542
where my wife went.

253
00:12:13,821 --> 00:12:15,621
She took her luggage
and went to the hotel.

254
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:17,861
What did you do?

255
00:12:18,502 --> 00:12:20,542
You made her so upset
that she went to stay out?

256
00:12:21,422 --> 00:12:23,021
I spoke briefly to her.

257
00:12:23,101 --> 00:12:23,941
And she

258
00:12:24,022 --> 00:12:24,861
left?

259
00:12:24,941 --> 00:12:25,823
A person over fifty

260
00:12:25,903 --> 00:12:27,062
is still so stubborn.

261
00:12:27,142 --> 00:12:28,302
It's really too much.

262
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:29,942
Who is being willful?

263
00:12:30,022 --> 00:12:31,342
You came back without a word.

264
00:12:31,422 --> 00:12:32,223
You should go now

265
00:12:32,303 --> 00:12:33,461
to take care of Xiaojiao.

266
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:34,423
Why did you come

267
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,142
and make trouble here?

268
00:12:36,382 --> 00:12:37,901
I have taken care of her for a while.

269
00:12:37,981 --> 00:12:39,821
My legs and back

270
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:40,862
are all exhausted.

271
00:12:40,942 --> 00:12:42,701
My back is killing me.

272
00:12:43,341 --> 00:12:44,501
I'm also starving.

273
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:45,901
Can you make me something to eat?

274
00:12:45,981 --> 00:12:47,502
As a dignified president,

275
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:49,221
I left an important meeting

276
00:12:50,022 --> 00:12:51,341
to come back and cook for you?

277
00:12:51,581 --> 00:12:53,062
Order takeout yourself.

278
00:12:53,221 --> 00:12:54,062
That's not okay.

279
00:12:54,142 --> 00:12:54,823
The oil is bad.

280
00:12:54,903 --> 00:12:56,422
It's not healthy.

281
00:12:57,302 --> 00:12:58,261
I rarely come back.

282
00:12:58,341 --> 00:13:00,221
Is it too much to ask you
to make some noodles?

283
00:13:03,941 --> 00:13:04,941
You won't do it?

284
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:06,621
Alright then,

285
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:08,422
I'll call Mom

286
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:09,741
and tell her

287
00:13:10,062 --> 00:13:11,341
that you and your wife

288
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:13,302
are teaming up to bully me.

289
00:13:14,101 --> 00:13:15,101
Chunyan,

290
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:17,221
you know very well that Mom

291
00:13:17,302 --> 00:13:19,221
looks down on her because of the kids.

292
00:13:19,502 --> 00:13:21,221
Are you adding fuel?

293
00:13:21,701 --> 00:13:23,261
Then it's scallion oil noodles

294
00:13:23,341 --> 00:13:24,142
with a fried egg.

295
00:13:24,222 --> 00:13:26,062
And it's a sunny-side-up egg.

296
00:13:26,142 --> 00:13:27,141
If I eat it,

297
00:13:27,221 --> 00:13:28,262
I won't call Mom.

298
00:13:30,741 --> 00:13:32,621
Alright, boiled egg.

299
00:13:34,701 --> 00:13:36,141
Tomorrow, you go find

300
00:13:36,221 --> 00:13:37,221
a new job.

301
00:13:38,581 --> 00:13:39,741
If you can't find one,

302
00:13:39,821 --> 00:13:41,782
then I'll use my connections
to find you one.

303
00:13:41,941 --> 00:13:43,102
Whatever you want to do,

304
00:13:43,182 --> 00:13:44,182
you choose for yourself.

305
00:13:44,542 --> 00:13:45,982
Dad, I want to go to the cemetery.

306
00:13:46,062 --> 00:13:47,621
I like that job.

307
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,222
What? You're not allowed to go.

308
00:13:49,302 --> 00:13:50,621
You are simply making me furious.

309
00:13:50,701 --> 00:13:52,903
- You are an overseas returnee.
- Don't talk like that.

310
00:13:52,903 --> 00:13:54,222
What job can't you find?

311
00:13:54,222 --> 00:13:55,542
- You're too disobedient.
- How did you say so?

312
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:56,741
If you're working,

313
00:13:56,821 --> 00:13:57,822
then why lie to us?

314
00:13:57,902 --> 00:13:58,662
How did I lie?

315
00:13:58,662 --> 00:14:00,262
- Why lie to us?
- You two forced me to find a job.

316
00:14:00,262 --> 00:14:01,341
Is that right?

317
00:14:01,502 --> 00:14:02,741
Chengyi, isn't it?

318
00:14:02,821 --> 00:14:04,062
Why would she lie?

319
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:05,741
Is it because you pressure me every day?

320
00:14:05,821 --> 00:14:06,662
My sister and I

321
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:08,342
lived under your expectations for life.

322
00:14:08,422 --> 00:14:09,222
Chengyi, can't I

323
00:14:09,302 --> 00:14:09,901
do something

324
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:11,302
- that I want to do?
- I mean...

325
00:14:11,302 --> 00:14:12,142
Stop.

326
00:14:12,222 --> 00:14:13,222
Look at your job.

327
00:14:13,302 --> 00:14:13,862
Can't you find

328
00:14:13,942 --> 00:14:15,102
an office job?

329
00:14:15,182 --> 00:14:16,021
What's wrong with it?

330
00:14:16,101 --> 00:14:16,943
What's good about it?

331
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:17,982
I spent so much money

332
00:14:18,062 --> 00:14:19,102
to send you abroad.

333
00:14:19,182 --> 00:14:19,861
I'll repay you.

334
00:14:19,861 --> 00:14:21,781
- I'll repay you.
- I didn't ask you to repay me.

335
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:23,422
I asked you to find a good job.

336
00:14:23,502 --> 00:14:24,302
What's the harm?

337
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:25,223
Dad, check out

338
00:14:25,303 --> 00:14:26,261

339
00:14:26,341 --> 00:14:27,902

367
00:17:25,341 --> 00:17:26,341
Qian Hao.

368
00:17:27,542 --> 00:17:29,141
I won't divorce you.

369
00:17:30,982 --> 00:17:31,623
I will not

370
00:17:31,703 --> 00:17:33,341
live well with you either.

371
00:17:35,861 --> 00:17:36,582
I'll watch you

372
00:17:36,662 --> 00:17:38,062
give birth to the child,

373
00:17:39,022 --> 00:17:40,462
and then watch you

00:17:41,381 --> 00:17:42,782
rot in the mud.

375
00:17:49,022 --> 00:17:49,862
You're carrying

376
00:17:49,942 --> 00:17:50,863
another man's child.

377
00:17:50,943 --> 00:17:52,422
Stay out of my business.

378
00:17:52,502 --> 00:17:53,422
I've told you

379
00:17:53,502 --> 00:17:54,102
that I just

380
00:17:54,182 --> 00:17:55,382
can't do it

381
00:17:55,462 --> 00:17:56,462
with you.

382
00:17:58,101 --> 00:17:59,142
We each made a mistake.

383
00:17:59,222 --> 00:18:00,661
Let's call it even.

384
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:02,741
Let's forget all those things.

385
00:18:02,821 --> 00:18:03,542
Let's be together

386
00:18:03,622 --> 00:18:04,982
like we used to be.

387
00:18:05,661 --> 00:18:06,661
Alright?

388
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:09,141
I already told you.

389
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,982
Don't ask such a stupid question again.

390
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:24,475
♪I wish to meet you and embrace you♪

391
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:28,517
♪One's fate is predestined♪

♪Spare no effort♪

393

(Do you have time lately?
Let's meet up.)

394
00:18:40,126 --> 00:18:43,790
♪A lifetime of happiness,

395
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:47,577

397
00:19:01,661 --> 00:19:02,383
Still awake?

398
00:19:02,463 --> 00:19:03,502
No school tomorrow?

399
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:07,061
Are we moving

400
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:08,821
to live with Mr. Mei?

401
00:19:09,742 --> 00:19:11,541
Why should we live with him?

402
00:19:11,621 --> 00:19:13,062
Isn't he your boyfriend?

403
00:19:14,502 --> 00:19:16,141
He's now my friend.

404
00:19:16,341 --> 00:19:17,942
But Dami, Xiaomi, and Lili

405
00:19:18,022 --> 00:19:19,661
are my real family.

406
00:19:19,782 --> 00:19:20,622
We've just moved

407
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:21,581
closer to look after

408
00:19:21,661 --> 00:19:22,541
each other

409
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:23,621
more conveniently.

410
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:27,062
Does Mr. Mei have kids at home?

411
00:19:27,381 --> 00:19:27,881
Two

412
00:19:27,943 --> 00:19:29,302
daughters as cute as you.

413
00:19:30,101 --> 00:19:31,541
What if

414
00:19:31,621 --> 00:19:32,621
I don't like them?

415
00:19:33,181 --> 00:19:34,621
Then just play with them less.

416
00:19:34,782 --> 00:19:36,262
Don't you still have your brother?

417
00:19:38,581 --> 00:19:39,502
As for our life,

418
00:19:39,582 --> 00:19:41,142
perhaps due to Mr. Mei's joining,

419
00:19:41,222 --> 00:19:42,821
there may be slight changes.

420
00:19:42,901 --> 00:19:43,742
But

421
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:44,902
I'll definitely respect

422
00:19:44,982 --> 00:19:46,101
you and Xiaomi.

423
00:19:49,624 --> 00:19:51,621
There's something
that I want to discuss with you.

424
00:19:52,581 --> 00:19:54,142
Can we not tell your dad

425
00:19:54,222 --> 00:19:55,702
the address of our new place?

426
00:19:55,942 --> 00:19:57,742
Will Dad take my brother away?

427
00:19:58,502 --> 00:19:59,502
Perhaps he will.

428
00:20:00,901 --> 00:20:02,622
Then I promise not to tell him.

429
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:03,942
I'll definitely protect Xiaomi.

430
00:20:04,022 --> 00:20:04,522
Even Dad

431
00:20:04,543 --> 00:20:05,821
can't separate us.

432
00:20:07,502 --> 00:20:08,901
My daughter is awesome.

433
00:20:10,341 --> 00:20:10,983
Go to bed.

434
00:20:11,063 --> 00:20:12,021
You have dark circles.

435
00:20:12,021 --> 00:20:12,463
Hurry up.

436
00:20:12,463 --> 00:20:13,502
Go quickly.

437
00:20:22,661 --> 00:20:24,462
Daddy Pig was alone with

438
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:26,022
Peppa and George.

439
00:20:26,661 --> 00:20:27,462
One day,

440
00:20:27,661 --> 00:20:28,741
he met

441
00:20:28,821 --> 00:20:30,621
an Aunt Bear he likes.

442
00:20:31,581 --> 00:20:32,901
They became neighbors.

443
00:20:34,181 --> 00:20:36,742
Aunt Bear also has two babies,

444
00:20:37,101 --> 00:20:39,222
named Xiong Da and Xiong Er.

445
00:20:40,341 --> 00:20:41,462
Peppa and George

446
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,301
often play with Xiong Da and Xiong Er

447
00:20:43,381 --> 00:20:44,661
together.

448
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:46,382
They like each other.

449
00:20:46,462 --> 00:20:48,101
Not only are they good neighbors,

450
00:20:48,181 --> 00:20:49,262
they also became friends.

451
00:20:51,341 --> 00:20:53,661
This story tells us

452
00:20:54,381 --> 00:20:56,341
to be kind

453
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:57,661
to the neighbor's children.

454
00:20:58,702 --> 00:21:00,341
Especially the new ones.

455
00:21:00,821 --> 00:21:01,821
Dad.

456
00:21:01,982 --> 00:21:03,382
You have the story of Goldilocks

457
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:05,621
and the Three Bears.

458
00:21:06,062 --> 00:21:07,142
Peppa and George are not

459
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:08,062
in the same story

460
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,101
as Xiong Da and Xiong Er.

461
00:21:10,462 --> 00:21:12,101
And they will never be neighbors.

462
00:21:12,702 --> 00:21:13,702
Dad,

463
00:21:14,101 --> 00:21:15,182
are you trying to say

464
00:21:15,262 --> 00:21:15,943
that Ms. Xu

465
00:21:16,023 --> 00:21:17,702
wants to be our neighbor?

466
00:21:19,821 --> 00:21:20,821
Perhaps,

467
00:21:22,222 --> 00:21:24,621
she should be.

468
00:21:28,542 --> 00:21:29,942
And as for Ms. Xu,

469
00:21:30,702 --> 00:21:32,101
she's the one I like.

470
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:34,021
Moreover,

471
00:21:34,101 --> 00:21:35,021
she even saved Yule.

472
00:21:35,101 --> 00:21:36,101
Do you think so?

473
00:21:37,341 --> 00:21:38,261
She'll soon become

474
00:21:38,341 --> 00:21:39,341
our neighbor.

475
00:21:39,462 --> 00:21:40,541
So, can you

476
00:21:40,621 --> 00:21:41,383
become friends

477
00:21:41,463 --> 00:21:42,621
with her children?

478
00:21:50,141 --> 00:21:51,141
Sure.

479
00:21:54,942 --> 00:21:56,302
Alright, let's sleep.

480
00:21:56,661 --> 00:21:57,622
Goodnight, Dad.

481
00:21:57,702 --> 00:21:58,942
Okay, goodnight.

482
00:22:15,821 --> 00:22:17,462
I don't like Xiong Da and Xiong Er.

483
00:22:19,022 --> 00:22:20,262
I don't like them either.

484
00:22:48,062 --> 00:22:49,581
Let me tell you some good news.

485
00:22:49,661 --> 00:22:50,821
Just now,

486
00:22:50,942 --> 00:22:53,062
I finished talking with Yu'an and Yule.

487
00:22:53,262 --> 00:22:55,061
They're willing to be friends

488
00:22:55,141 --> 00:22:56,141
with Xiaomi and Dami.

489
00:22:56,381 --> 00:22:58,421
Don't worry, this small matter

490
00:22:58,581 --> 00:23:00,702
can be handled in no time.

491
00:23:03,581 --> 00:23:05,341
These two kids are difficult
to deal with.

492
00:23:05,502 --> 00:23:06,661
I don't believe it.

493
00:23:06,861 --> 00:23:08,421
Mei Chengyi must have been fooled.

494
00:23:09,901 --> 00:23:11,542
That is really great.

495
00:23:11,861 --> 00:23:13,621
I really can't wait.

496
00:23:21,341 --> 00:23:22,062
Xu Kaixin,

497
00:23:22,142 --> 00:23:23,421
you're so hypocritical.

498
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:39,742
Wasn't what you said to Youyou today

499
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:42,062
a bit too harsh?

500
00:23:43,982 --> 00:23:45,062
Look at you.

501
00:23:45,702 --> 00:23:47,581
You act tough when you should be kind.

502
00:23:47,742 --> 00:23:49,661
When you should be tough, you retreat.

503
00:23:50,302 --> 00:23:51,942
If the girl works in the cemetery,

504
00:23:52,022 --> 00:23:53,821
how can she have
a relationship later on?

505
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:55,181
There's nothing wrong with that,

506
00:23:55,381 --> 00:23:56,062
but she...

507
00:23:56,142 --> 00:23:57,222
What do you mean?

508
00:23:57,581 --> 00:23:58,942
Even if I support her for life,

509
00:23:59,022 --> 00:24:00,502
I can't let her do this job.

510
00:24:00,782 --> 00:24:02,502
She's on to it.

511
00:24:05,621 --> 00:24:07,821
Xu is moving in.

512
00:24:09,341 --> 00:24:10,702
Isn't that just a matter of time?

513
00:24:11,502 --> 00:24:12,861
Xu is also quite good.

514
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:15,942
Not living together,

515
00:24:16,502 --> 00:24:17,862
they rented another house

516
00:24:17,942 --> 00:24:19,262
in the same building.

517
00:24:22,062 --> 00:24:23,062
What's going on?

518
00:24:25,022 --> 00:24:26,262
What's going on?

519
00:24:27,302 --> 00:24:28,661
What do you mean by that?

520
00:24:28,861 --> 00:24:30,661
Can you be a bit more observant?

521
00:24:31,141 --> 00:24:32,062
Xu seems

522
00:24:32,142 --> 00:24:33,942
quite decent on the surface,

523
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,621
and to have no ulterior motives.

524
00:24:35,982 --> 00:24:38,101
But I'm afraid

525
00:24:38,782 --> 00:24:39,942
because she was deceived

526
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:41,061
during her first marriage,

527
00:24:41,141 --> 00:24:41,742
now she

528
00:24:41,822 --> 00:24:43,901
finds a fool to raise her children.

529
00:24:45,062 --> 00:24:46,261
We need to carefully

530
00:24:46,341 --> 00:24:47,301
check out

531
00:24:47,381 --> 00:24:48,662
if she is two-faced.

532
00:24:48,742 --> 00:24:49,262
What if

533
00:24:49,342 --> 00:24:51,021
the dowry for Yu'an and Yule

534
00:24:51,101 --> 00:24:52,381
all gets swindled by her?

535
00:25:01,062 --> 00:25:02,222
Take the middle lane.

536
00:25:02,302 --> 00:25:03,302
He's low on HP.

537
00:25:03,782 --> 00:25:05,621
Master, stop, you're low on HP.

538
00:25:12,022 --> 00:25:13,421
What's there to be angry about?

539
00:25:14,101 --> 00:25:16,181
This matter can't be hidden.

540
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:18,222
East wind, west wind.

541
00:25:18,302 --> 00:25:19,621
Let's see who's

542
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:22,141
more powerful.

543
00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:27,022
You played really badly today.

544
00:25:27,502 --> 00:25:28,581
Let's stop.

545
00:25:28,942 --> 00:25:30,621
You lowered the score.

546
00:25:33,581 --> 00:25:34,581
It's time.

547
00:25:34,782 --> 00:25:35,782
I have to go.

548
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:38,222
Staying up late isn't healthy.

549
00:25:38,982 --> 00:25:40,581
Master, don't worry.

550
00:25:40,661 --> 00:25:42,182
I'll definitely hold the position.

551
00:25:42,262 --> 00:25:44,062
If they don't let me return to work,

552
00:25:44,381 --> 00:25:46,341
I'd rather starve to death
and I won't give in.

553
00:25:46,581 --> 00:25:47,942
Starting tomorrow, I'll fast.

554
00:25:48,462 --> 00:25:49,383
Look at you.

555
00:25:49,463 --> 00:25:51,341
You haven't mastered it.

556
00:25:51,462 --> 00:25:52,462
Let me tell you.

557
00:25:52,581 --> 00:25:53,861
This enormous matter

558
00:25:54,222 --> 00:25:55,702
can't make you sacrifice your health.

559
00:25:55,782 --> 00:25:56,741
You know?

560
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:58,141
Eat and drink well.

561
00:25:58,982 --> 00:26:00,661
Alright, that's it.

562
00:26:00,982 --> 00:26:02,141
I'm going to sleep.

563
00:26:04,942 --> 00:26:05,942
Goodbye.

564
00:26:06,821 --> 00:26:07,821
Master.

565
00:26:08,141 --> 00:26:09,141
Master.

566
00:26:26,302 --> 00:26:27,302
Naughty again.

567
00:26:28,141 --> 00:26:29,462
Want to sleep with me?

568
00:26:31,062 --> 00:26:32,181
Just this once, okay?

569
00:26:39,381 --> 00:26:40,742
Maybe in the future,

570
00:26:41,262 --> 00:26:44,222
it might just be the two of us again.

571
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:50,341
If one day

572
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,381

- Come here.
- Slow down. Don't bump into things.

597
00:29:31,661 --> 00:29:32,222
Put it here.

598
00:29:32,222 --> 00:29:33,222
Right, good.

599
00:29:33,942 --> 00:29:34,942
Come on, let's go.

600
00:29:35,702 --> 00:29:37,502
Be careful. This is a bit heavy.

601
00:29:37,582 --> 00:29:38,622
Pile it up here.

602
00:29:38,702 --> 00:29:39,341
Okay.

603
00:29:39,581 --> 00:29:40,382
Can you handle it?

604
00:29:40,462 --> 00:29:41,262
Sure.

605
00:29:41,421 --> 00:29:43,381
Should another one be placed here?

606
00:29:43,542 --> 00:29:44,542
Come on.

607
00:29:44,702 --> 00:29:45,222
Stop it.

608
00:29:45,302 --> 00:29:45,942
Stop it.

609
00:29:46,022 --> 00:29:47,022
I'll do it.

610
00:29:54,181 --> 00:29:55,942
What are you secretly looking at?

611
00:29:57,861 --> 00:29:58,861
Nothing.

612
00:30:01,181 --> 00:30:02,222
Be careful.

613
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:03,982
Shameless.

614
00:30:04,062 --> 00:30:04,821
What are you doing?

615
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:06,101
Seeing a beautiful old lady,

616
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:07,542
you can't take your eyes off?

617
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,421
What are you talking about?

618
00:30:10,022 --> 00:30:11,301
Xu's family has moved in.

619
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:12,982
Chengyi is helping out there.

620
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,421
I haven't seen Chengyi.

621
00:30:15,942 --> 00:30:17,341
He carried the stuff upstairs.

622
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:18,901
Should I also

623
00:30:19,262 --> 00:30:20,821
go over there

624
00:30:21,101 --> 00:30:22,101
to help out?

625
00:30:23,302 --> 00:30:24,741
Do you want to help Chengyi,

626
00:30:24,821 --> 00:30:26,381
or help the beautiful old lady?

627
00:30:27,581 --> 00:30:29,101
You're in your sixties.

628
00:30:29,181 --> 00:30:30,742
Still jealous like this?

629
00:30:31,302 --> 00:30:32,781
You have no confidence in yourself,

630
00:30:32,861 --> 00:30:35,022
but you should have
some confidence in me.

631
00:30:37,062 --> 00:30:39,181
What dish is it? It smells so good.

632
00:30:40,742 --> 00:30:42,222
It's all for your daughter,

633
00:30:42,742 --> 00:30:43,741
who keeps fasting.

634
00:30:43,821 --> 00:30:44,942
I made

635
00:30:45,022 --> 00:30:46,222
all of her favorite dishes.

636
00:30:46,462 --> 00:30:48,141
I didn't even turn on the range hood.

637
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:49,501
I'm tempting her.

638
00:30:49,581 --> 00:30:51,462
I don't believe
she's really that determined.

639
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:54,141
Youyou hasn't eaten yet.

640
00:30:55,982 --> 00:30:57,821
She's determined, but I'm not.

641
00:31:07,502 --> 00:31:08,502
What flavor?

642
00:31:19,302 --> 00:31:20,302
Crayfish.

643
00:31:25,912 --> 00:31:27,160
Stir-fried lamb with scallions.

644
00:31:35,022 --> 00:31:36,062
Fried lotus root boxes.

645
00:31:37,782 --> 00:31:39,541
My mom definitely made rolled pork

646
00:31:39,621 --> 00:31:41,141
and century egg and lean pork congee.

647
00:31:50,262 --> 00:31:52,462
Don't use delicious food to punish me.

648
00:31:52,542 --> 00:31:54,222
Each dish is deadly.

649
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:59,022
Smelling it is as good as being full.

650
00:31:59,982 --> 00:32:01,542
Smelling it is as good as being full.

651
00:32:12,821 --> 00:32:13,501
Slow down.

652
00:32:13,581 --> 00:32:14,581
Slow down.

653
00:32:14,821 --> 00:32:15,821
Be careful.

654
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:17,062
Come here, slow down.

655
00:32:18,542 --> 00:32:19,542
Chengyi.

656
00:32:19,821 --> 00:32:20,942
Dad, why did you come here?

657
00:32:21,421 --> 00:32:21,942
Mr. You.

658
00:32:22,022 --> 00:32:23,022
Xu.

659
00:32:24,062 --> 00:32:25,301
This is unacceptable.

660
00:32:25,381 --> 00:32:27,702
How could you not inform us about
such a significant move?

661
00:32:27,782 --> 00:32:28,862
We can come and help.

662
00:32:28,942 --> 00:32:29,902
No need.

663
00:32:29,982 --> 00:32:30,621
Dad,

664
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:32,222
I hired a moving company.

665
00:32:32,302 --> 00:32:33,781
At your age, don't trouble yourself.

666
00:32:33,861 --> 00:32:34,782
What are you saying?

667
00:32:34,862 --> 00:32:36,821
I'm not that old yet.

668
00:32:36,942 --> 00:32:37,942
Right?

669
00:32:39,581 --> 00:32:40,581
Who is this?

670
00:32:41,022 --> 00:32:41,943
This is Lili,

671
00:32:42,023 --> 00:32:43,261
the one I told you about.

672
00:32:43,341 --> 00:32:45,581
Not my biological mom,
but surpassing a biological one.

673
00:32:45,942 --> 00:32:47,222
Right, hello.

674
00:32:47,302 --> 00:32:48,341
Hello.

675
00:32:48,421 --> 00:32:49,781
This is my best friend, Xiaoxiao.

676
00:32:49,861 --> 00:32:50,541
Hello, Mr. You.

677
00:32:50,621 --> 00:32:51,621
Hello.

678
00:32:51,861 --> 00:32:52,742
Chengyi is like

679
00:32:52,822 --> 00:32:54,301
a son to us.

680
00:32:54,381 --> 00:32:55,102
In the future,

681
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:57,581
we're practically in-laws
through our children.

682
00:32:57,661 --> 00:32:58,182
Right.

683
00:32:58,262 --> 00:32:59,262
We live nearby,

684
00:32:59,421 --> 00:33:00,581
so let's visit often, okay?

685
00:33:00,661 --> 00:33:02,062
Sure, let's care for each other.

686
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:03,422
You're too kind.

687
00:33:03,502 --> 00:33:04,502
Come on.

688
00:33:04,661 --> 00:33:05,382
I'll help out.

689
00:33:05,462 --> 00:33:05,962
No need.

690
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:07,181
Is that okay?

691
00:33:07,302 --> 00:33:08,302
That's okay.

692
00:33:09,181 --> 00:33:10,181
Here, we have

693
00:33:10,661 --> 00:33:11,581
a food market

694
00:33:11,661 --> 00:33:12,982
right over there.

695
00:33:13,581 --> 00:33:14,223
And over there,

696
00:33:14,303 --> 00:33:15,942
there's a community hospital.

697
00:33:16,062 --> 00:33:17,062
It's very convenient.

698
00:33:17,542 --> 00:33:19,064
There's a big square nearby.

699
00:33:19,202 --> 00:33:22,022
Every night, many people dance there.

700
00:33:22,581 --> 00:33:23,581
If you're interested,

701
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:24,661
we can go play together.

702
00:33:27,821 --> 00:33:29,222
One day I'll pin you to the wall.

703
00:33:29,302 --> 00:33:30,381
That's when you'll behave.

704
00:33:39,942 --> 00:33:41,581
You're so annoying.

705
00:34:03,502 --> 00:34:04,502
That's not right.

706
00:34:05,581 --> 00:34:07,421
One, two, three, four, five...

707
00:34:09,542 --> 00:34:11,022
I made six.

708
00:34:51,781 --> 00:34:53,581
Heaven hasn't abandoned me.

709
00:34:54,942 --> 00:34:56,822
Your father-in-law is pretty good.

710
00:34:57,741 --> 00:34:58,741
Right.

711
00:34:58,942 --> 00:34:59,783
How come you never

712
00:34:59,863 --> 00:35:01,382
talk about your parents, Mei Chengyi?

713
00:35:05,661 --> 00:35:06,661
What's the situation?

714
00:35:12,542 --> 00:35:13,542
Slow down.

715
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:25,141
Mom.

716
00:35:25,661 --> 00:35:26,822
We've gotten through it.

717
00:35:27,062 --> 00:35:28,062
Gotten through it.

718
00:35:28,581 --> 00:35:30,221
I'm here, don't be afraid.

719
00:35:30,701 --> 00:35:32,022
Let's go to the general ward.

720
00:35:35,062 --> 00:35:36,062
You...

721
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:37,822
Heaven won't take you yet.

722
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,581
Come back with me.

723
00:35:40,101 --> 00:35:41,661
Let's just live together honestly.

724
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:46,221
It'll get better.

725
00:35:51,101 --> 00:35:52,261
We've gotten through it.

726
00:35:53,261 --> 00:35:54,261
It will get better.

727
00:36:03,701 --> 00:36:04,502
Well...

728
00:36:04,661 --> 00:36:06,141
All the big items are here.

729
00:36:06,382 --> 00:36:07,221
Start unpacking that.

730
00:36:07,301 --> 00:36:07,903
I'll check out

731
00:36:07,983 --> 00:36:09,221
if there is anything left out.

732
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:10,862
Be careful then, watch your back.

733
00:36:11,062 --> 00:36:12,062
Don't worry.

734
00:36:18,022 --> 00:36:19,342
Watch your back.

735
00:36:19,902 --> 00:36:22,501
You're starting to care
about his back now.

736
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:23,581
Keep your voice down.

737
00:36:23,661 --> 00:36:24,423
Think about

738
00:36:24,503 --> 00:36:25,661
my feelings as a single one.

739
00:36:25,741 --> 00:36:26,741
Okay?

740
00:36:27,701 --> 00:36:28,701
What now?

741
00:36:29,141 --> 00:36:30,181
Song Ran has gone.

742
00:36:31,902 --> 00:36:33,061
He ran faster than a rabbit,

743
00:36:33,141 --> 00:36:34,382
and never showed up again.

744
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:36,022
Men.

745
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:40,824
He's not right.
Is he hiding something from you?

746
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,862
I asked about his parents.
Why didn't he respond?

747
00:36:42,862 --> 00:36:43,862
He pretended not to hear.

748
00:36:44,181 --> 00:36:45,862
Who doesn't have personal privacy?

749
00:36:45,942 --> 00:36:46,662
The two of us

750
00:36:46,742 --> 00:36:48,701
are just good partners.

751
00:36:48,781 --> 00:36:50,062
The rest isn't important.

752
00:36:50,261 --> 00:36:51,621
Okay, good partners.

753
00:36:52,022 --> 00:36:53,022
Go ahead.

754
00:36:53,342 --> 00:36:54,342
Be good partners.

755
00:37:00,942 --> 00:37:01,902
It's not hot anymore.

756
00:37:01,982 --> 00:37:03,062
Come, take a sip.

757
00:37:04,462 --> 00:37:05,581
Mom, take a sip.

758
00:37:07,382 --> 00:37:08,382
What's wrong?

759
00:37:12,661 --> 00:37:14,022
There is a caregiver.

760
00:37:14,141 --> 00:37:15,141
What did you say?

761
00:37:16,181 --> 00:37:17,382
There is a caregiver.

762
00:37:17,982 --> 00:37:19,181
You go back.

763
00:37:20,181 --> 00:37:21,181
It's okay, mom.

764
00:37:21,462 --> 00:37:22,581
I'll stay here with you.

765
00:37:22,661 --> 00:37:23,862
I'll sleep here tonight.

766
00:37:25,062 --> 00:37:26,621
Come on, take a sip.

767
00:37:28,902 --> 00:37:30,342
Come on, Mom.

768
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:33,022
Mom, take a sip.

769
00:37:33,942 --> 00:37:34,741
Mom.

770
00:37:34,862 --> 00:37:36,661
Let me do it. You go back and rest.

771
00:37:44,502 --> 00:37:46,141
Sir, hurry up.

772
00:37:46,221 --> 00:37:47,302
I'm also a mother.

773
00:37:47,382 --> 00:37:48,781
I know what your mom means.

774
00:37:49,221 --> 00:37:50,181
If you do this,

775
00:37:50,261 --> 00:37:51,581
she'll be more anxious.

776
00:37:52,301 --> 00:37:52,943
Originally,

777
00:37:53,023 --> 00:37:54,462
she doesn't have much strength.

778
00:37:54,902 --> 00:37:56,382
You'll make her more tired here.

779
00:38:01,581 --> 00:38:03,462
Then I'll go back,
take a nap and come back.

780
00:38:06,902 --> 00:38:07,902
Thanks.

781
00:38:09,062 --> 00:38:10,062
Don't worry.

782
00:38:12,822 --> 00:38:13,822
Then I'm leaving.

783
00:38:17,781 --> 00:38:18,781
Be careful.

784
00:38:22,022 --> 00:38:23,022
Then I'm leaving.

785
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:32,783
Come, ma'am.

786
00:38:32,863 --> 00:38:34,261
Let's have another sip of porridge.

787
00:38:35,581 --> 00:38:36,581
Come on.

788
00:38:37,462 --> 00:38:38,621
Ma'am, if you don't eat,

789
00:38:38,701 --> 00:38:39,862
it'll be bad for your health.

790
00:38:40,181 --> 00:38:41,181
That's not okay.

791
00:38:41,261 --> 00:38:42,382
Eat a little.

792
00:38:43,462 --> 00:38:44,581
Come on, Ma'am.

793
00:38:49,862 --> 00:38:50,902
Like a piece of seaweed.

794
00:38:50,982 --> 00:38:52,462
Seaweed.

795
00:38:52,542 --> 00:38:53,701
Swaying with the wind.

796
00:38:53,781 --> 00:38:55,701
Seaweed.

797
00:38:55,822 --> 00:38:57,101
Dancing in the waves.

798
00:38:57,181 --> 00:38:57,702
How is it?

799
00:38:57,782 --> 00:38:59,022
What is this?

800
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,262
Xiaomi and Dami

801
00:39:00,342 --> 00:39:00,943
are moving.

802
00:39:01,023 --> 00:39:02,181
I'm afraid they won't adapt.

803
00:39:02,581 --> 00:39:03,383
I'll surprise them

804
00:39:03,463 --> 00:39:04,822
by setting the mood. How about it?

805
00:39:06,022 --> 00:39:07,022
Pretty good.

806
00:39:07,701 --> 00:39:08,501
Perfunctory.

807
00:39:08,581 --> 00:39:10,062
No, quite cute.

808
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,262
By the way, I have to go now.

809
00:39:13,342 --> 00:39:14,942
Yu'an and Yule had dinner

810
00:39:15,022 --> 00:39:16,462
at their Grandparents' place.

811
00:39:16,542 --> 00:39:17,741
They'll be back soon.

812
00:39:18,301 --> 00:39:19,462
Aren't you eating here?

813
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:20,742
Today is the warming party.

814
00:39:20,822 --> 00:39:22,061
Next time, I'll bring both

815
00:39:22,141 --> 00:39:22,742
of them.

816
00:39:22,822 --> 00:39:23,662
The thing is, Youyou

817
00:39:23,742 --> 00:39:25,181
had trouble with her parents again.

818
00:39:25,261 --> 00:39:26,022
Those two

819
00:39:26,102 --> 00:39:27,741
staying too long will become annoying.

820
00:39:27,942 --> 00:39:28,942
True.

821
00:39:29,022 --> 00:39:30,022
They're here.

822
00:39:30,181 --> 00:39:31,621
Surprise!

823
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:32,742
Like a piece of seaweed.

824
00:39:32,822 --> 00:39:34,101
Seaweed.

825
00:39:34,181 --> 00:39:35,062
Swaying with the wind.

826
00:39:35,142 --> 00:39:36,221
Look at your new home.

827
00:39:36,530 --> 00:39:38,386
♪Seaweed♪

828
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:50,382
What's for dinner?

829
00:39:50,502 --> 00:39:51,422
Fried bullfrog.

830
00:39:51,502 --> 00:39:52,502
Alright.

831
00:39:53,382 --> 00:39:53,982
Yu'an, Yule.

832
00:39:54,062 --> 00:39:54,662
- Dad.
- Dad.

833
00:39:54,742 --> 00:39:56,221
- My good dad.
- My good dad.

834
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:58,742
Chengyi is here.

835
00:39:58,822 --> 00:39:59,822
Chengyi, you're back.

836
00:39:59,982 --> 00:40:01,422
Come have dinner.

837
00:40:01,701 --> 00:40:02,302
Come on.

838
00:40:02,382 --> 00:40:03,062
Dad.

839
00:40:03,221 --> 00:40:03,822
Have dinner.

840
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:04,463
Hurry up.

841
00:40:04,543 --> 00:40:06,382
Kids, quickly sit down.

842
00:40:08,502 --> 00:40:09,502
Come quickly.

843
00:40:09,661 --> 00:40:11,022
They're almost done moving, right?

844
00:40:11,502 --> 00:40:12,102
Almost.

845
00:40:12,182 --> 00:40:13,382
They just need to tidy up.

846
00:40:15,661 --> 00:40:18,022
This meal is exquisite today.

847
00:40:18,982 --> 00:40:21,342
There are spring rolls, crayfish,

848
00:40:21,688 --> 00:40:22,942
stir-fried lamb with scallions,

849
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:25,221
and century egg and lean pork congee.

850
00:40:25,701 --> 00:40:27,621
It's so bountiful.

851
00:40:31,301 --> 00:40:32,301
Really delicious.

852
00:40:32,942 --> 00:40:34,823
Working for another old lady,
and being tired.

853
00:40:34,903 --> 00:40:36,181
How can it not be tasty?

854
00:40:36,261 --> 00:40:37,382
Watch your mouth!

855
00:40:41,382 --> 00:40:42,382
Chengyi.

856
00:40:42,661 --> 00:40:43,701
I didn't mean that.

857
00:40:43,781 --> 00:40:44,982
I wasn't talking to you.

858
00:40:46,221 --> 00:40:47,422
It's alright, Mom. I know.

859
00:40:53,382 --> 00:40:54,382
Really delicious.

860
00:40:56,982 --> 00:40:57,822
One day,

861
00:40:57,902 --> 00:40:58,823
I'll let them

862
00:40:58,903 --> 00:41:00,221
drive me crazy.

863
00:41:00,781 --> 00:41:02,221
The old one doesn't settle down.

864
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:03,982
The young one doesn't care.

865
00:41:04,181 --> 00:41:07,382
The old one eats like a pig.
The young one insists on fasting.

866
00:41:08,181 --> 00:41:08,823
Why is life

867
00:41:08,903 --> 00:41:10,542
so tough for me?

868
00:41:11,342 --> 00:41:12,382
Youyou still isn't eating?

869
00:41:13,382 --> 00:41:14,382
No.

870
00:41:15,141 --> 00:41:16,781
She has refused to come out and eat.

871
00:41:17,502 --> 00:41:18,501
It's okay

872
00:41:18,581 --> 00:41:20,181
for young people to skip a few meals.

873
00:41:20,261 --> 00:41:21,261
They won't starve.

874
00:41:24,542 --> 00:41:25,342
What are you doing?

875
00:41:25,502 --> 00:41:27,221
If she doesn't eat, then you don't.

876
00:41:27,942 --> 00:41:29,382
You're being unreasonable.

877
00:41:29,462 --> 00:41:31,141
You're being unreasonable daily.

878
00:41:31,221 --> 00:41:32,822
Why can't I be unreasonable once?

879
00:41:33,342 --> 00:41:34,342
Mom, Dad.

880
00:41:34,942 --> 00:41:35,942
I'll go check on her.

881
00:41:48,902 --> 00:41:49,902
Youyou.

882
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:52,741
Is it okay if I come in?

883
00:42:03,982 --> 00:42:04,982
Sure.

884
00:42:07,502 --> 00:42:08,502
What's wrong?

885
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:10,902
Chengyi.

886
00:42:21,862 --> 00:42:22,982
We were worried about you.

887
00:42:23,062 --> 00:42:24,221
Okay, it's fine.

888
00:42:24,822 --> 00:42:25,822
Chengyi.

889
00:42:27,621 --> 00:42:28,982
You can't betray me.

890
00:42:29,141 --> 00:42:30,501
I want to return to the cemetery.

891
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:33,022
If I don't go back soon,
I'm afraid they'll replace me.

892
00:42:35,062 --> 00:42:35,942
Alright.

893
00:42:36,062 --> 00:42:37,062
Chengyi.

894
00:42:37,741 --> 00:42:38,741
Chengyi.

895
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:40,302
Don't look down on our cemetery.

896
00:42:40,382 --> 00:42:42,581
Yongshou Cemetery
is the best in Jiang City.

897
00:42:42,741 --> 00:42:44,221
Many college and graduate students

898
00:42:44,301 --> 00:42:45,822
are scrambling to work there.

899
00:42:46,301 --> 00:42:47,301
Really.

900
00:42:49,261 --> 00:42:50,261
I'm begging you.

901
00:42:58,462 --> 00:42:59,621
What does he mean?

902
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:04,741
He'll settle it for me.
