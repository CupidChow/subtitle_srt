This child is not Qian Hao's.

You!

19
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:45,042
Well,

20
00:01:45,762 --> 00:01:46,923
whose is it then?

21
00:01:47,003 --> 00:01:48,322
You have to find the man.

22
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:50,163
You have to make him responsible.

23
00:01:50,602 --> 00:01:51,682

24
00:01:51,762 --> 00:01:52,563
abort the child

and injure your body,

26
00:01:53,643 --> 00:01:54,522
you might not

27
00:01:54,602 --> 00:01:55,443
get another child.

28
00:01:55,602 --> 00:01:56,323
Right, tell me,

29
00:01:56,403 --> 00:01:58,003
who is that man?

30
00:01:58,122 --> 00:01:59,402
Stop asking.

31
00:01:59,803 --> 00:02:00,843
I don't know either.

32
00:02:02,003 --> 00:02:03,123
I was drunk that day,

33
00:02:03,203 --> 00:02:04,723
and he was gone when I woke up.

34
00:02:05,443 --> 00:02:07,042
How could you do such an absurd thing?

35
00:02:07,122 --> 00:02:07,882
You!

36
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:09,083
Xia Chungeng.

37
00:02:09,163 --> 00:02:10,163
Your niece

38
00:02:10,243 --> 00:02:11,563
really went too far.

39
00:02:11,723 --> 00:02:13,122
It boggles my mind!

40
00:02:13,202 --> 00:02:14,322
I can't handle it anymore.

41
00:02:15,642 --> 00:02:16,762
You, you!

42
00:02:18,642 --> 00:02:20,642
How could you do something like that?

43
00:02:43,802 --> 00:02:44,962
(He holds my hands smoothly.)

44
00:02:45,042 --> 00:02:46,562
(Practice makes perfect.)

45
00:02:46,642 --> 00:02:48,122
(Did the sun rise from the west?)

46
00:02:48,202 --> 00:02:49,443
(Is my charm too overwhelming?)

47
00:02:49,523 --> 00:02:50,922
(He finally couldn't resist it.)

48
00:02:51,802 --> 00:02:53,322
They are holding hands.

49
00:02:53,523 --> 00:02:54,523
Ms. Xu.

50
00:02:54,802 --> 00:02:56,523
In the building on your right side,

51
00:02:56,963 --> 00:02:58,203
the balcony with green plants.

52
00:02:58,283 --> 00:02:59,203
Don't turn your head.

53
00:02:59,283 --> 00:03:00,283
Just sneak a glance.

54
00:03:00,482 --> 00:03:01,122
An old man

55
00:03:01,202 --> 00:03:02,202
and two girls, right?

56
00:03:05,042 --> 00:03:06,042
Right.

57
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:08,562
Your father-in-law and two daughters?

58
00:03:08,642 --> 00:03:09,642
Right.

59
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:11,083
They are standing there,

60
00:03:11,163 --> 00:03:12,722
secretly observing us.

61
00:03:12,802 --> 00:03:14,562
So, we have to play this act well,

62
00:03:14,642 --> 00:03:15,282
to convince them

63
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,362
you're my girlfriend.

64
00:03:17,042 --> 00:03:19,416
Actually, that old man is nice. Really.

65
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,336
- Okay.
- You'll know once you get to know him.

66
00:03:21,432 --> 00:03:23,123
- Okay.
- He's nice, but naughty.

67
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:25,282
(He wants me to get
to know his father-in-law.)

68
00:03:25,362 --> 00:03:26,123
(It's not just)

69
00:03:26,203 --> 00:03:27,362
(an act then.)

70
00:03:27,642 --> 00:03:28,484
(Man,)

71
00:03:28,564 --> 00:03:30,163
(you've exposed your thoughts.)

72
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,443
Oh my.

73
00:03:31,523 --> 00:03:33,003
They're really intimate.

74
00:03:36,163 --> 00:03:37,163
Don't be nervous.

75
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:38,843
I'm not nervous.

76
00:03:40,523 --> 00:03:41,603
I've already talked

77
00:03:41,683 --> 00:03:42,723
to Yu'an and Yule.

78
00:03:43,403 --> 00:03:43,924
However,

79
00:03:44,004 --> 00:03:45,323
these two kids

80
00:03:45,403 --> 00:03:47,003
blow hot and cold.

81
00:03:47,202 --> 00:03:48,202
I'm worried...

82
00:03:48,563 --> 00:03:49,563
Right?

83
00:03:50,123 --> 00:03:51,123
No need to worry.

84
00:03:51,322 --> 00:03:52,682
Let's go with the flow.

85
00:03:52,762 --> 00:03:54,242
It's not certain yet.

86
00:03:54,322 --> 00:03:55,322
Let's go.

87
00:03:55,563 --> 00:03:56,642
Alright.

88
00:04:02,202 --> 00:04:02,923
Alright.

89
00:04:03,003 --> 00:04:03,723
Let's go in.

90
00:04:03,803 --> 00:04:05,163
Come on, let's go in.

91
00:04:10,322 --> 00:04:11,482
Do you remember

92
00:04:11,602 --> 00:04:13,443
our strategy and tactics

93
00:04:13,523 --> 00:04:14,522
this time?

94
00:04:14,602 --> 00:04:16,123
We won't do whatever she likes.

95
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:18,482
- Right.
- We'll do whatever she doesn't like.

96
00:04:18,562 --> 00:04:19,204
Okay.

97
00:04:19,284 --> 00:04:20,522
Act exactly like this later.

98
00:04:20,602 --> 00:04:21,362
Got it?

99
00:04:21,482 --> 00:04:23,002
Come on, cheer up.

100
00:04:23,283 --> 00:04:24,083
Go for it.

101
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,283
They're coming.

102
00:04:25,442 --> 00:04:26,442
Go for it.

103
00:04:30,643 --> 00:04:31,203
Chengyi.

104
00:04:31,442 --> 00:04:33,562
- Well...
- She's my sister-in-law, Youyou.

105
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:34,842
Slippers.

106
00:04:34,922 --> 00:04:35,682
- Alright.
- Here.

107
00:04:36,163 --> 00:04:36,763
Put those on.

108
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:37,682
Take these.

109
00:04:37,802 --> 00:04:38,883
- Hello.
- Hello.

110
00:04:38,963 --> 00:04:39,722
Thank you.

111
00:04:39,802 --> 00:04:41,602
- Dad.
- Mom.

112
00:04:43,362 --> 00:04:44,003
So many things.

113
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,362
This is my father-in-law,
and my mother-in-law.

114
00:04:46,602 --> 00:04:47,602
Hello, uncle and auntie.

115
00:04:47,682 --> 00:04:48,682
Welcome.

116
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:51,682
You are Chengyi's girlfriend?

117
00:04:52,682 --> 00:04:53,922
You look quite pretty.

118
00:04:54,323 --> 00:04:55,362
My name is Xu Kaixin.

119
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:57,603
You didn't have

120
00:04:57,683 --> 00:04:59,002
to bring anything.

121
00:04:59,602 --> 00:05:00,403
Out of courtesy.

122
00:05:00,562 --> 00:05:02,802
Come on, call her Auntie.

123
00:05:02,922 --> 00:05:04,482
I don't like her.

124
00:05:04,682 --> 00:05:05,682
I won't call her that.

125
00:05:05,802 --> 00:05:07,042
Right, she isn't pretty.

126
00:05:07,122 --> 00:05:08,203
I don't like her.

127
00:05:09,002 --> 00:05:09,802
Yu'an, Yule.

128
00:05:09,883 --> 00:05:11,003
What are you talking about?

129
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:11,842
Being so rude.

130
00:05:11,922 --> 00:05:13,522
Is this what I usually teach you?

131
00:05:13,602 --> 00:05:14,283
Right.

132
00:05:14,363 --> 00:05:15,802
Why being so rude?

133
00:05:16,682 --> 00:05:17,922
They are young and ignorant.

134
00:05:18,002 --> 00:05:19,203
Don't be mad, okay?

135
00:05:19,482 --> 00:05:20,443
Be happy.

136
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:22,243
Right, Xu Kaixin.

137
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:23,002
Right?

138
00:05:23,163 --> 00:05:24,083
It's okay, Uncle.

139
00:05:24,163 --> 00:05:25,043
My two children

140
00:05:25,123 --> 00:05:26,602
also don't like Chengyi.

141
00:05:26,963 --> 00:05:28,083
Now we're even.

142
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,282
- Hello.
- Don't stand there.

143
00:05:35,362 --> 00:05:36,024
Go sit inside.

144
00:05:36,123 --> 00:05:38,083
-The meal will be ready.
- Go in and take a seat.

145
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:38,922
- Okay.
- Go in.

146
00:05:39,002 --> 00:05:40,002
Okay.

147
00:05:40,163 --> 00:05:41,163
Take a seat.

148
00:05:53,403 --> 00:05:54,922
No need.

149
00:06:07,203 --> 00:06:09,403
Master, just a small token.

150
00:06:10,283 --> 00:06:11,283
A small token.

151
00:06:14,163 --> 00:06:18,083
Well, not proper.

152
00:06:24,763 --> 00:06:26,002
What do you mean?

153
00:06:26,723 --> 00:06:27,723
You don't understand?

154
00:06:37,122 --> 00:06:38,122
I see.

155
00:06:38,883 --> 00:06:39,883
Let me do it.

156
00:06:45,802 --> 00:06:47,002
Master, hold it still.

157
00:06:47,212 --> 00:06:49,592
(Destiny)

158
00:06:55,403 --> 00:06:57,003
We have fate now, so ask anything.

159
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,922
Make yourself at home and relax.

160
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:03,362
I'll ask.

161
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:06,723
Master,

162
00:07:07,682 --> 00:07:08,922
I have been divorced once.

163
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,443
When I'm

164
00:07:10,523 --> 00:07:11,723
with my ex-wife,

165
00:07:11,922 --> 00:07:14,123
it's not quite good, but not bad either.

166
00:07:14,203 --> 00:07:15,403
I have a son and a daughter.

167
00:07:16,682 --> 00:07:17,922
After the divorce,

168
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:19,203
I'm not doing well

169
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,922
with my current wife.

170
00:07:23,002 --> 00:07:24,242
My mom gets sick,

171
00:07:24,763 --> 00:07:25,763
and is in poor health.

172
00:07:25,963 --> 00:07:27,562
And I had a car accident.

173
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:30,124
Right.

174
00:07:30,204 --> 00:07:31,602
Then my wife and I

175
00:07:31,922 --> 00:07:33,682
can't have a child.

176
00:07:36,482 --> 00:07:37,323
Please take a look

177
00:07:37,403 --> 00:07:38,403
what's going on.

178
00:07:40,922 --> 00:07:42,203
Not surprising.

179
00:07:43,242 --> 00:07:44,522
Some people are

180
00:07:44,602 --> 00:07:46,562
living a hard time.

181
00:07:49,203 --> 00:07:50,523
Did I go off topic?

182
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:51,884
It's alright.

183
00:07:51,964 --> 00:07:54,843
Consider this a gift.

184
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:56,602
Back to the main topic,

185
00:07:57,242 --> 00:07:58,683
do you have time and date of birth

186
00:07:58,763 --> 00:08:01,042
of the two women you mentioned?

187
00:08:01,723 --> 00:08:02,802
- Yes.
- Yes.

188
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:04,042
We have them.

189
00:08:07,682 --> 00:08:08,682
Master.

190
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:16,323
We met by destiny. Take it easy.

191
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:19,963
The Tao begets one,

192
00:08:20,043 --> 00:08:22,843
one begets two, two begets three,
and three begets all things.

193
00:08:23,843 --> 00:08:24,843
Got it.

194
00:08:25,002 --> 00:08:25,723
So fast?

195
00:08:25,803 --> 00:08:27,042
I'm skillful.

196
00:08:27,763 --> 00:08:31,763
Your second wife has a Water destiny.

197
00:08:31,843 --> 00:08:33,403
And you have a Metal destiny.

198
00:08:34,003 --> 00:08:35,962
As the old saying, Metal benefits Water.

199
00:08:36,042 --> 00:08:38,283
In theory, when you two
got together first,

200
00:08:38,363 --> 00:08:39,683
she should benefit you.

201
00:08:39,763 --> 00:08:41,322
- Right?
- Right.

202
00:08:41,523 --> 00:08:42,163
But...

203
00:08:42,243 --> 00:08:43,123
Right.

204
00:08:43,203 --> 00:08:44,243
Metal benefits Water.

205
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:46,523
Too much Water ruins Metal.

206
00:08:49,202 --> 00:08:50,202
You don't understand?

207
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:52,523
We met by destiny.
Then I will explain it

208
00:08:52,603 --> 00:08:54,202
in a simple way.

209
00:08:55,123 --> 00:08:56,643
When she benefits you,

210
00:08:57,243 --> 00:08:58,642
she is like the purified water

211
00:08:58,722 --> 00:09:01,003
smitten with you.

212
00:09:01,243 --> 00:09:03,442
You are like the new metal.

213
00:09:03,562 --> 00:09:04,762
When the new metal encounters

214
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:06,683
the purified water smitten with you,

215
00:09:06,763 --> 00:09:08,603
then the water is turned into wealth.

216
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:11,163
Even if you do nothing,

217
00:09:11,243 --> 00:09:12,923
you can still thrive and prosper.

218
00:09:13,003 --> 00:09:13,842
Am I right?

219
00:09:13,922 --> 00:09:14,562
Yes.

220
00:09:14,922 --> 00:09:16,243
But things changed.

221
00:09:16,442 --> 00:09:18,243
They are not complementary anymore,

222
00:09:18,603 --> 00:09:20,763
but opposing each other now.

223
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:23,202
This is critical.

224
00:09:23,403 --> 00:09:25,362
She has changed from the purified water

225
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:27,603
to shameless nuclear polluted water.

226
00:09:27,962 --> 00:09:29,322
And your son

227
00:09:29,442 --> 00:09:30,243
has changed from

228
00:09:30,323 --> 00:09:31,882
a promising talent

229
00:09:31,962 --> 00:09:33,122
to the one

230
00:09:33,202 --> 00:09:34,242
others live off.

231
00:09:34,322 --> 00:09:35,603
You understand.

232
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:37,722
Two people

233
00:09:37,922 --> 00:09:40,643
live off him

234
00:09:41,003 --> 00:09:42,962
mixed with the nuclear polluted water.

235
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:43,842
Buddy.

236
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,722
If you don't live a hard time, who does?

237
00:09:47,163 --> 00:09:48,603
Is what I said reasonable?

238
00:09:50,442 --> 00:09:52,722
However, your ex-wife

239
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:54,202
is pretty good.

240
00:09:54,643 --> 00:09:57,243
She has a gentle Wood destiny.

241
00:09:58,243 --> 00:10:00,322
This Wood, once ignited,

242
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:02,642
can turn you

243
00:10:02,722 --> 00:10:05,603
into seed capital.

244
00:10:05,722 --> 00:10:07,082
A perfect match.

245
00:10:08,283 --> 00:10:09,283
You missed it.

246
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:11,243
What a pity.

247
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:18,443
Hold on.

248
00:10:18,523 --> 00:10:19,523
What's wrong?

249
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,602
The Tao begets one, one begets two,

250
00:10:27,682 --> 00:10:29,523
two begets three,
and three begets all things.

251
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,456
(Prosperity From the East)
Two begets three,

252
00:10:34,456 --> 00:10:36,362
and three begets all things.

253
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:37,442
Yes.

254
00:10:39,042 --> 00:10:40,042
No.

255
00:10:43,082 --> 00:10:45,922
No?

256
00:10:47,442 --> 00:10:48,443
Well...

257
00:10:48,523 --> 00:10:49,523
How come...

258
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:50,682
Master.

259
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:53,003
Come on.

260
00:10:57,403 --> 00:10:58,403
Madam.

261
00:10:58,603 --> 00:11:00,123
I have carefully calculated.

262
00:11:00,283 --> 00:11:01,362
The problem lies with

263
00:11:01,442 --> 00:11:03,202
your son.

264
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:07,923
His ex-wife is compatible with him,
yet he didn't cherish her.

265
00:11:08,003 --> 00:11:09,002
It doesn't matter.

266
00:11:09,082 --> 00:11:09,804
But no matter

267
00:11:09,884 --> 00:11:11,563
how his current wife is

268
00:11:11,643 --> 00:11:12,524
incompatible with him,

269
00:11:12,604 --> 00:11:13,962
it shouldn't make your family

270
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:14,683
suffer.

271
00:11:14,763 --> 00:11:15,763
What does it mean?

272
00:11:15,922 --> 00:11:18,043
It means there is only one truth.

273
00:11:18,123 --> 00:11:19,762
I don't know if I should say it.

274
00:11:19,842 --> 00:11:20,842
Say it.

275
00:11:22,643 --> 00:11:23,962
You must have done

276
00:11:24,042 --> 00:11:26,322
something bad

277
00:11:26,922 --> 00:11:28,002
to harm your karma

278
00:11:28,082 --> 00:11:30,002
and end your family's blessings.

279
00:11:30,082 --> 00:11:31,082
Think.

280
00:11:31,603 --> 00:11:32,362
Think it carefully.

281
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:33,324
What's

282
00:11:33,404 --> 00:11:34,642
that exactly?

283
00:11:34,722 --> 00:11:36,123
Master, anyway...

284
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:37,923
No matter what we've done,

285
00:11:38,003 --> 00:11:39,642
they are all in the past.

286
00:11:39,722 --> 00:11:42,283
Just tell us how to resolve it.

287
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:45,722
You're straightforward.

288
00:11:46,802 --> 00:11:47,403
I'm here.

289
00:11:47,483 --> 00:11:48,483
No rush.

290
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,802
Let's share a bit first.

291
00:11:51,082 --> 00:11:53,083
Besides focusing on my main job,

292
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:54,443
I also

293
00:11:54,523 --> 00:11:56,203
study law as a minor.

294
00:11:56,283 --> 00:11:58,922
After learning law, I realized,

295
00:11:59,243 --> 00:12:00,003
before the trial,

296
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:01,203
if you pay more,

297
00:12:01,283 --> 00:12:02,962
it'll reduce your sentence.

298
00:12:03,042 --> 00:12:04,002
Why?

299
00:12:04,082 --> 00:12:06,643
Because the victim
receiving more compensation

300
00:12:06,883 --> 00:12:09,523
is much better
than you serving more jail time.

301
00:12:09,802 --> 00:12:12,002
The more you spend,
the less jail time you get.

302
00:12:12,082 --> 00:12:13,722
Alright. Just tell us how much

303
00:12:13,922 --> 00:12:14,762
we need to spend.

304
00:12:14,842 --> 00:12:16,883
It depends on how much
wrongdoing you've committed.

305
00:12:18,403 --> 00:12:20,802
How much karma you need to eliminate.

306
00:12:21,082 --> 00:12:22,323
You mean,

307
00:12:22,403 --> 00:12:23,842
as long as I spend money,

308
00:12:23,922 --> 00:12:25,163
then my mom can get better,

309
00:12:25,243 --> 00:12:26,762
and my wife and I can have children.

310
00:12:26,842 --> 00:12:27,842
Is that what you mean?

311
00:12:28,643 --> 00:12:30,283
Not exactly.

312
00:12:30,722 --> 00:12:32,002
For example, your mom

313
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:32,763
gets sick,

314
00:12:32,843 --> 00:12:34,442
and might only live for a year.

315
00:12:34,523 --> 00:12:37,043
But if you spend money
to eliminate karma,

316
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,163
maybe she can live

317
00:12:38,243 --> 00:12:39,842
for nearly ten years. But who knows?

318
00:12:39,922 --> 00:12:40,922
But,

319
00:12:41,243 --> 00:12:42,682
when it comes to children,

320
00:12:42,842 --> 00:12:43,922
we should

321
00:12:44,202 --> 00:12:45,922
stick to the science.

322
00:12:46,082 --> 00:12:46,922
Don't be ashamed.

323
00:12:47,042 --> 00:12:48,203
Just go see a doctor.

324
00:12:48,283 --> 00:12:49,442
What?

325
00:12:49,722 --> 00:12:50,444
What did you say?

326
00:12:50,524 --> 00:12:51,842
You should go see a doctor.

327
00:12:51,922 --> 00:12:53,443
I've tolerated you for a long time.

328
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,002
What's wrong with you?

329
00:12:55,082 --> 00:12:56,002
Talking nonsense.

330
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:56,804
Did you

331
00:12:56,884 --> 00:12:57,842
stay in jail before?

332
00:12:57,922 --> 00:12:58,563
Let's go.

333
00:12:58,643 --> 00:12:59,563
- Hao.
- Let's go.

334
00:12:59,643 --> 00:13:00,444
- Sorry.
- Let's go.

335
00:13:00,524 --> 00:13:01,922
Sorry, Master.

336
00:13:02,003 --> 00:13:03,082
Hao.

337
00:13:03,643 --> 00:13:04,683
Master, sorry.

338
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:06,362
Master? He's just a fraud.

339
00:13:06,442 --> 00:13:08,722
You're driving me mad.

340
00:13:11,523 --> 00:13:12,523
Sir.

341
00:13:12,643 --> 00:13:14,242
The deal fell through again.

342
00:13:14,322 --> 00:13:15,082
You!

343
00:13:15,283 --> 00:13:17,123
No, no.

344
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:18,762
We are

345
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:19,723
like salesman,

346
00:13:19,803 --> 00:13:21,202
and need to find the pain points.

347
00:13:21,922 --> 00:13:23,002
Look how anxious he was.

348
00:13:23,082 --> 00:13:23,843
What does it mean?

349
00:13:23,923 --> 00:13:25,883
It means we found his pain points.

350
00:13:26,802 --> 00:13:28,563
He would

351
00:13:28,643 --> 00:13:29,842
come back soon.

352
00:13:30,082 --> 00:13:31,442
I'm serious.

353
00:13:33,682 --> 00:13:34,762
How do you know

354
00:13:34,842 --> 00:13:36,323
they have done something bad?

355
00:13:36,403 --> 00:13:37,163
What if they...

356
00:13:37,243 --> 00:13:38,203
What do you mean?

357
00:13:38,283 --> 00:13:39,842
I've told you

358
00:13:39,922 --> 00:13:42,042
to read more and improve yourself.

359
00:13:42,202 --> 00:13:43,283
Don't slack off.

360
00:13:43,483 --> 00:13:45,243
That's a psychological trick just now.

361
00:13:45,523 --> 00:13:47,443
What I said is the master key,

362
00:13:47,523 --> 00:13:48,204
and he took it

363
00:13:48,284 --> 00:13:49,483
to open his door.

364
00:13:49,722 --> 00:13:50,762
You don't get it.

365
00:13:50,842 --> 00:13:51,883
Leave now.

366
00:13:52,883 --> 00:13:54,083
I'm tired of the conversation.

367
00:13:54,163 --> 00:13:55,642
I need to rest.

368
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:56,722
Then rest well.

369
00:14:09,842 --> 00:14:10,842
How about it?

370
00:14:13,363 --> 00:14:15,082
Treat this place as her own place,

371
00:14:15,643 --> 00:14:17,163
and act to be relaxed.

372
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:18,883
Quite an expert.

373
00:14:19,202 --> 00:14:21,163
At least not a fool.

374
00:14:23,403 --> 00:14:25,082
She didn't say to help us?

375
00:14:25,163 --> 00:14:26,163
She wanted to help.

376
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:28,242
I told her

377
00:14:28,322 --> 00:14:29,562
not to help,

378
00:14:30,483 --> 00:14:31,683
then she just sat there

379
00:14:31,763 --> 00:14:32,763
and didn't get up.

380
00:14:34,363 --> 00:14:37,722
Yu'an and Yule ignored her,

381
00:14:38,163 --> 00:14:39,962
and she also ignored them.

382
00:14:40,243 --> 00:14:41,283
Impressive!

383
00:14:42,962 --> 00:14:44,443
You are wasting your time.

384
00:14:44,523 --> 00:14:45,722
Not even the right fit at all.

385
00:14:46,082 --> 00:14:47,243
Just watch me.

386
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,163
What's wrong with you two?

387
00:14:51,442 --> 00:14:52,883
What did you say to me yesterday?

388
00:14:53,442 --> 00:14:54,842
Were you polite back then?

389
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:57,523
Dad.

390
00:14:58,123 --> 00:14:59,682
- My good Dad.
- My good Dad.

391
00:15:00,123 --> 00:15:01,362
- Dad.
- Dad.

392
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:02,083
Hey, you kids.

393
00:15:02,163 --> 00:15:03,044
If you don't behave,

394
00:15:03,124 --> 00:15:04,363
I'll spank you.

395
00:15:06,523 --> 00:15:07,962
You bad dad!

396
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,363
Dad.

397
00:15:09,643 --> 00:15:10,324
(This is the Dad)

398
00:15:10,404 --> 00:15:11,962
(Dami wants, right?)

399
00:15:12,163 --> 00:15:13,882
(He looks good
when doting on his girls.)

400
00:15:13,962 --> 00:15:15,763
(Ten more points can be added.)

401
00:15:19,123 --> 00:15:20,123
Have some fruit.

402
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:21,403
Okay.

403
00:15:21,603 --> 00:15:22,603
Here.

404
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:24,123
Thank you.

405
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:29,643
I'm Youyou,

406
00:15:29,723 --> 00:15:31,283
Yu'an and Yule's aunt.

407
00:15:31,682 --> 00:15:32,362
I know.

408
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:33,442
He told me that.

409
00:15:33,722 --> 00:15:34,284
Actually,

410
00:15:34,364 --> 00:15:35,803
I'm on your side.

411
00:15:35,883 --> 00:15:37,083
But it's four against three.

412
00:15:37,163 --> 00:15:38,682
The difference in strength is big.

413
00:15:39,682 --> 00:15:40,444
I hope you can

414
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:41,882
deal with my parents.

415
00:15:41,962 --> 00:15:43,523
If you really can't,

416
00:15:43,763 --> 00:15:44,763
run right away.

417
00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:46,082
I'll cover for you.

418
00:15:47,202 --> 00:15:47,962
Okay.

419
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:49,242
Time to eat.

420
00:15:49,322 --> 00:15:49,882
Come on.

421
00:15:49,962 --> 00:15:51,163
- Time to eat.
- Come to eat.

422
00:15:51,243 --> 00:15:52,044
Yu'an, Yule, come.

423
00:15:52,124 --> 00:15:53,283
Come on, Yu'an, Yule.

424
00:15:53,363 --> 00:15:54,403
Come on. Hurry.

425
00:15:54,483 --> 00:15:55,160
Let's go eat.

426
00:15:55,256 --> 00:15:56,504
- Come on.
- Let's eat first.

427
00:15:56,842 --> 00:15:58,483
You've prepared so many dishes?

428
00:15:59,962 --> 00:16:01,123
I forgot it.

429
00:16:01,763 --> 00:16:02,962
We need an extra chair.

430
00:16:06,842 --> 00:16:07,842
Youyou,

431
00:16:07,962 --> 00:16:09,562
go get one more chair.

432
00:16:10,562 --> 00:16:12,003
Aren't there seven people?

433
00:16:12,283 --> 00:16:12,963
What's wrong?

434
00:16:13,043 --> 00:16:14,442
Who is coming?

435
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:17,202
Set a place for your sister.

436
00:16:17,283 --> 00:16:20,002
Finding a stepmother
for Yu'an and Yule is important.

437
00:16:20,082 --> 00:16:21,643
She has to be here and supervise.

438
00:16:26,442 --> 00:16:27,802
(That's really killing.)

439
00:16:28,082 --> 00:16:29,523
(Indeed, the family fighting)

440
00:16:29,603 --> 00:16:31,403
(is really the women's specialty.)

441
00:16:31,483 --> 00:16:33,283
(Here comes the trouble.)

442
00:16:33,763 --> 00:16:34,763
Xu,

443
00:16:35,883 --> 00:16:37,163
you don't mind, do you?

444
00:16:37,682 --> 00:16:38,842
Of course not.

445
00:16:39,082 --> 00:16:40,362
It's that chair, right?

446
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:41,163
I'll move it.

447
00:16:41,243 --> 00:16:41,962
Let me do it.

448
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,403
- Don't. It's heavy.
- I'll do it.

449
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,003
Alright.

450
00:16:45,202 --> 00:16:46,283
It really is a bit heavy.

451
00:16:48,643 --> 00:16:49,243
Where did

452
00:16:49,323 --> 00:16:50,842
their mom usually sit?

453
00:16:57,842 --> 00:16:59,202
Oh, my!

454
00:16:59,403 --> 00:17:01,762
Master was so accurate.

455
00:17:01,842 --> 00:17:02,723
He even knew what

456
00:17:02,803 --> 00:17:03,923
happened to Xu Kaixin.

457
00:17:04,003 --> 00:17:04,724
Oh, my!

458
00:17:04,804 --> 00:17:06,002
Do you want to drive me crazy?

459
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:06,963
If you are rich,

460
00:17:07,043 --> 00:17:07,964
just give money to me.

461
00:17:08,044 --> 00:17:09,922
Why give money to him?

462
00:17:10,442 --> 00:17:11,242
Tell me.

463
00:17:11,323 --> 00:17:12,563
Many people do bad things.

464
00:17:12,643 --> 00:17:13,564
Many people

465
00:17:13,644 --> 00:17:15,323
take the house away after divorce.

466
00:17:15,403 --> 00:17:17,162
Why are we the ones to get retribution?

467
00:17:17,242 --> 00:17:18,442
Even if

468
00:17:18,803 --> 00:17:20,122
we did something wrong,

469
00:17:20,202 --> 00:17:20,964
how to make amends?

470
00:17:21,044 --> 00:17:22,003
Return the house

471
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:22,763
now?

472
00:17:22,843 --> 00:17:23,483
No way.

473
00:17:23,563 --> 00:17:24,442
It's worth millions.

474
00:17:24,522 --> 00:17:25,362
That's it.

475
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:26,243
Get in the car.

476
00:17:26,323 --> 00:17:27,162
But

477
00:17:27,242 --> 00:17:30,122
as long as we do it right...

478
00:17:30,202 --> 00:17:30,883
Let me tell you.

479
00:17:30,963 --> 00:17:32,843
Small money can accomplish a lot.

480
00:17:33,522 --> 00:17:34,522
Mom,

481
00:17:35,603 --> 00:17:36,922
I am not a good guy,

482
00:17:37,002 --> 00:17:38,442
nor a fool.

483
00:17:38,843 --> 00:17:39,643
If you make me

484
00:17:39,723 --> 00:17:41,202
into a bad fool,

485
00:17:41,282 --> 00:17:41,843
then no one

486
00:17:41,923 --> 00:17:43,202
can save us.

487
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:44,442
I will listen to you.

488
00:17:44,522 --> 00:17:45,483
Let's go.

489
00:17:45,563 --> 00:17:46,563
Alright.

490
00:17:52,163 --> 00:17:53,843
Come on, please.

491
00:17:59,442 --> 00:18:01,043
Mom,

492
00:18:02,363 --> 00:18:03,084
it's not proper.

493
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:04,643
What's wrong?

494
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:05,602
Chengyi.

495
00:18:05,682 --> 00:18:06,602
You are

496
00:18:06,682 --> 00:18:08,442
leaving the past behind, right?

497
00:18:08,682 --> 00:18:09,403
You are

498
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:10,883
making us sad.

499
00:18:11,202 --> 00:18:12,002
It's okay.

500
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:13,282
It's okay.

501
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:15,803
Auntie, I also have children.

502
00:18:15,883 --> 00:18:17,083
I really understand you.

503
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:17,764
Just think

504
00:18:17,844 --> 00:18:19,482
from another perspective.

505
00:18:20,043 --> 00:18:21,643
Yu'an and Yule's mom

506
00:18:21,962 --> 00:18:23,762
will surely feel comforted.

507
00:18:26,363 --> 00:18:27,363
It's okay.

508
00:18:29,682 --> 00:18:30,962
Let the children eat.

509
00:18:40,843 --> 00:18:41,962
Yu'an, Yule,

510
00:18:42,403 --> 00:18:43,402
just have

511
00:18:43,482 --> 00:18:44,762
the meal.

512
00:18:49,803 --> 00:18:50,442
(Sorry.)

513
00:18:50,522 --> 00:18:52,523
(I didn't expect them to go this far.)

514
00:18:52,603 --> 00:18:54,083
(But it's not against you.)

515
00:18:54,202 --> 00:18:55,803
(No matter who I bring back today,)

516
00:18:56,563 --> 00:18:57,563
(they will be like this.)

517
00:18:58,403 --> 00:18:59,442
(I don't mind it.)

518
00:18:59,522 --> 00:19:00,602
(I'm even envious.)

519
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:01,682
(Do you believe it?)

520
00:19:05,403 --> 00:19:06,962
What do you want to eat?

521
00:19:11,643 --> 00:19:13,563
This pork knuckle looks delicious.

522
00:19:16,682 --> 00:19:17,284
Dad,

523
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,003
I also want to eat the pork knuckle.

524
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:20,442
Me too.

525
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:24,163
Here.

526
00:19:31,563 --> 00:19:32,843
I'll get it for you. Try this.

527
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:33,962
It's really delicious.

528
00:19:35,363 --> 00:19:36,084
Dad.

529
00:19:36,164 --> 00:19:37,682
I also want to eat the corn.

530
00:19:37,762 --> 00:19:39,002
Me too.

531
00:19:41,563 --> 00:19:42,283
Here.

532
00:19:42,363 --> 00:19:43,363
Here.

533
00:19:44,242 --> 00:19:45,003
Here you are.

534
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,083
Pass it over to them.

535
00:19:55,883 --> 00:19:57,482
Dad, I want to eat this.

536
00:19:57,682 --> 00:19:58,843
I want pork ribs too.

537
00:20:00,682 --> 00:20:02,083
What's going on with you two?

538
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:03,244
She is a guest.

539
00:20:03,324 --> 00:20:04,442
You should behave!

540
00:20:05,002 --> 00:20:05,643
They are kids,

541
00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:07,083
why be so strict?

542
00:20:08,002 --> 00:20:09,323
If their mom knew

543
00:20:09,403 --> 00:20:11,163
they got scolded for eating something,

544
00:20:11,442 --> 00:20:13,442
she'd come
knocking on your door at night.

545
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,043
Dad, wait.

546
00:20:15,363 --> 00:20:16,563
I'm teaching them manners.

547
00:20:16,643 --> 00:20:17,883
It's different.

548
00:20:18,002 --> 00:20:19,083
Why do you say so?

549
00:20:19,282 --> 00:20:20,803
It's the same thing.

550
00:20:21,202 --> 00:20:22,323
With so many dishes,

551
00:20:22,403 --> 00:20:23,403
no one will go hungry.

552
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:24,522
Here.

553
00:20:25,002 --> 00:20:26,002
Yu'an, here you are.

554
00:20:31,043 --> 00:20:31,964
Do the two of them

555
00:20:32,044 --> 00:20:33,803
have something

556
00:20:33,883 --> 00:20:34,842
they hate to eat

557
00:20:34,922 --> 00:20:36,242
or are most afraid to eat?

558
00:20:46,282 --> 00:20:47,442
Try the preserved egg.

559
00:20:47,682 --> 00:20:48,682
Okay.

560
00:20:53,442 --> 00:20:54,162
The preserved egg

561
00:20:54,242 --> 00:20:55,242
you made is delicious.

562
00:20:55,403 --> 00:20:56,403
It's so flavorful.

563
00:20:57,962 --> 00:21:00,184
I'm having the one with pork floss
for the first time.

564
00:21:00,282 --> 00:21:01,282
Very delicious.

565
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,762
Xu, look.

566
00:21:22,043 --> 00:21:23,883
Chengyi, Yu'an and Yule

567
00:21:24,282 --> 00:21:25,083
have been with us,

568
00:21:25,282 --> 00:21:26,762
supporting each other

569
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:28,202
these past few years.

570
00:21:28,563 --> 00:21:30,002
People often say,

571
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,083
a son-in-law is like half a son.

572
00:21:32,682 --> 00:21:33,524
It's understandable

573
00:21:33,604 --> 00:21:34,883
that Chengyi wants

574
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,163
to take a step forward.

575
00:21:36,643 --> 00:21:37,843
And we can be considered

576
00:21:38,002 --> 00:21:39,282
his parents.

577
00:21:39,843 --> 00:21:41,403
His real parents are not around,

578
00:21:41,563 --> 00:21:42,803
so,

579
00:21:42,883 --> 00:21:44,563
we want to help

580
00:21:45,002 --> 00:21:46,083
him here.

581
00:21:46,282 --> 00:21:48,563
Today's your first visit,

582
00:21:49,043 --> 00:21:50,243
so we have something

583
00:21:50,323 --> 00:21:52,002
we'd like to know.

584
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,083
Do you mind?

585
00:21:53,163 --> 00:21:53,804
Auntie,

586
00:21:53,884 --> 00:21:55,643
I'll tell you everything.

587
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:59,762
What do your parents do?

588
00:22:00,163 --> 00:22:01,163
I don't know.

589
00:22:02,442 --> 00:22:03,442
Here's the thing.

590
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:04,284
I was raised

591
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,803
by my aunt.

592
00:22:05,883 --> 00:22:06,922
I don't know

593
00:22:07,002 --> 00:22:08,763
who my biological parents are.

594
00:22:08,843 --> 00:22:09,524
Anyway,

595
00:22:09,604 --> 00:22:10,723
I haven't met them.

596
00:22:10,803 --> 00:22:11,763
However,

597
00:22:11,843 --> 00:22:13,442
I feel particularly fortunate.

598
00:22:13,643 --> 00:22:14,484
My aunt treats me

599
00:22:14,564 --> 00:22:16,083
just like her own daughter.

600
00:22:16,442 --> 00:22:17,482
She's called Lili,

601
00:22:17,682 --> 00:22:19,643
a retired teacher.

602
00:22:19,962 --> 00:22:21,563
She is now living with me.

603
00:22:21,682 --> 00:22:23,083
She has never married.

604
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,843
So, to be honest,

605
00:22:27,002 --> 00:22:28,523
seeing how you treat

606
00:22:28,603 --> 00:22:29,883
Yu'an and Yule's mom today,

607
00:22:30,043 --> 00:22:30,804
I really

608
00:22:30,884 --> 00:22:32,482
envy her.

609
00:22:32,843 --> 00:22:33,443
Even now,

610
00:22:33,523 --> 00:22:35,202
you're separated,

611
00:22:35,282 --> 00:22:36,044
she can still feel

612
00:22:36,124 --> 00:22:37,563
your deep affection.

613
00:22:43,762 --> 00:22:44,762
Here's the thing.

614
00:22:44,922 --> 00:22:45,842
Ms. Xu.

615
00:22:45,922 --> 00:22:46,603
Chengyi

616
00:22:46,683 --> 00:22:48,442
has been single for many years.

617
00:22:48,522 --> 00:22:49,842
You know why.

618
00:22:49,922 --> 00:22:51,522
For the sake of the two of them.

619
00:22:52,002 --> 00:22:53,962
You also have two kids.

620
00:22:54,603 --> 00:22:55,482
- Right?
- Uncle.

621
00:22:55,722 --> 00:22:56,763
After I came here today,

622
00:22:56,843 --> 00:22:57,363
you must have

623
00:22:57,443 --> 00:22:59,002
a lot of questions to ask me.

624
00:22:59,403 --> 00:23:01,442
Do you want to hear the detailed version

625
00:23:01,522 --> 00:23:03,202
or the vague version?

626
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:05,122
The vague version will do.

627
00:23:05,202 --> 00:23:06,922
The detailed one.

628
00:23:07,083 --> 00:23:07,724
Let's go with

629
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:08,962
Auntie's preference.

630
00:23:10,163 --> 00:23:11,202
I'll tell you everything,

631
00:23:11,282 --> 00:23:13,122
so no one has doubts.

632
00:23:13,202 --> 00:23:14,202
Okay.

633
00:23:14,762 --> 00:23:15,602
Youyou,

634
00:23:15,682 --> 00:23:16,483
can you please

635
00:23:16,563 --> 00:23:17,244
take the two kids

636
00:23:17,324 --> 00:23:18,563
to play nearby for a while?

637
00:23:18,803 --> 00:23:19,962
There's something

638
00:23:20,163 --> 00:23:21,323
not suitable for them.

639
00:23:22,762 --> 00:23:24,243
No, I'll go.

640
00:23:24,323 --> 00:23:25,602
I need to get them to eat.

641
00:23:25,682 --> 00:23:27,563
Yu'an, Yule, get up.

642
00:23:30,722 --> 00:23:31,962
This way. Hurry.

643
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:38,083
Here's the thing.

644
00:23:38,163 --> 00:23:39,202
Four years ago...

645
00:23:40,403 --> 00:23:41,403
Honey.

646
00:23:41,563 --> 00:23:43,762
I'm not pleading for Xiaojiao.

647
00:23:44,282 --> 00:23:46,002
I'm mad too.

648
00:23:46,522 --> 00:23:48,642
I thought she became a mistress,

649
00:23:48,722 --> 00:23:49,842
hooking up with

650
00:23:49,922 --> 00:23:50,443
a lousy man,

651
00:23:50,523 --> 00:23:52,563
which is the worst she can do.

652
00:23:52,682 --> 00:23:53,682
I didn't expect...

653
00:23:56,563 --> 00:23:57,563
Fortunately,

654
00:23:57,722 --> 00:23:59,803
she is not our biological child.

655
00:24:00,083 --> 00:24:01,563
Let me say something.

656
00:24:01,883 --> 00:24:03,563
You always say Qian Hao is bad.

657
00:24:04,123 --> 00:24:05,323
He is good for nothing.

658
00:24:06,202 --> 00:24:07,083
But if you ask them

659
00:24:07,163 --> 00:24:09,563
to divorce,
what kind of man can Xiaojiao find?

660
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:12,083
With her experience,
who else can she find?

661
00:24:12,163 --> 00:24:13,163
You're right.

662
00:24:13,803 --> 00:24:15,282
I need to call my sister.

663
00:24:16,282 --> 00:24:18,123
She should discipline her.

664
00:24:20,002 --> 00:24:21,002
Well,

665
00:24:22,403 --> 00:24:24,123
what about the child?

666
00:24:26,202 --> 00:24:26,963
Later,

667
00:24:27,043 --> 00:24:28,803
I'll take her to the hospital
for a check-up.

668
00:24:38,163 --> 00:24:39,483
Don't you come to eat with me?

669
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:40,602
I have things to do today.

670
00:24:40,682 --> 00:24:41,642
You go up.

671
00:24:41,722 --> 00:24:43,282
I'll watch you go upstairs.

672
00:24:44,123 --> 00:24:45,243
No need.

673
00:24:45,323 --> 00:24:46,122
Seriously.

674
00:24:46,202 --> 00:24:46,883
Go up.

675
00:24:47,163 --> 00:24:49,123
Alright, drive carefully.

676
00:24:50,202 --> 00:24:50,922
Take it slow.

677
00:24:51,002 --> 00:24:52,002
Okay.

678
00:24:53,043 --> 00:24:53,763
Take it slow.

679
00:24:53,843 --> 00:24:54,843
Okay.

680
00:25:22,482 --> 00:25:23,482
Let's go.

681
00:25:31,603 --> 00:25:32,283
Is it my turn?

682
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:33,363
Next one.

683
00:25:34,522 --> 00:25:36,163
With so many people,
we have to queue up.

684
00:25:45,482 --> 00:25:46,482
Young man.

685
00:25:46,563 --> 00:25:48,323
You don't seem

686
00:25:48,442 --> 00:25:50,123
to be pregnant.

687
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:51,804
What?

688
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,323
I'm a man, how can I be pregnant?

689
00:25:54,403 --> 00:25:55,803
You know it?

690
00:25:55,883 --> 00:25:56,804
Many pregnant women

691
00:25:56,884 --> 00:25:57,882
are all standing here.

692
00:25:57,962 --> 00:25:59,163
Don't you feel ashamed?

693
00:26:02,883 --> 00:26:03,883
Then you sit.

694
00:26:04,363 --> 00:26:05,363
Thank you.

695
00:26:06,202 --> 00:26:07,202
Come on, sit.

696
00:26:08,883 --> 00:26:09,563
Sit down.

697
00:26:09,643 --> 00:26:10,363
Thank you.

698
00:26:10,522 --> 00:26:11,522
You're welcome.

699
00:26:20,762 --> 00:26:22,323
This figure is fine.

700
00:26:28,883 --> 00:26:29,962
Click Like.

701
00:26:31,282 --> 00:26:33,083
Madam, please sit.

702
00:26:33,163 --> 00:26:34,004
My master

703
00:26:34,084 --> 00:26:35,122
is meditating

704
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:36,202
and practicing outside.

705
00:26:36,442 --> 00:26:37,004
At noon,

706
00:26:37,084 --> 00:26:38,842
he meditates every day.

707
00:26:38,922 --> 00:26:40,682
- Alright.
- Please wait here.

708
00:26:40,922 --> 00:26:41,963
Can I go in?

709
00:26:42,043 --> 00:26:42,762
No.

710
00:26:42,883 --> 00:26:44,763
Madam, my master...

711
00:26:44,843 --> 00:26:45,483
Madam.

712
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:46,563
Madam, you...

713
00:26:47,363 --> 00:26:48,363
Master,

714
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:52,762
heavenly secrets cannot be revealed,

715
00:26:53,323 --> 00:26:57,282
but that mother and her son
are having such a hard time.

716
00:26:57,803 --> 00:27:00,843
Even if I break a major precept

717
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:02,282
and ruin my resolve,

718
00:27:02,682 --> 00:27:03,803
but as we met by destiny,

719
00:27:05,202 --> 00:27:08,282
I want to try to help them.

720
00:27:13,002 --> 00:27:14,002
Master.

721
00:27:16,482 --> 00:27:17,284
Master.

722
00:27:17,364 --> 00:27:18,643
Madam, you're here again.

723
00:27:19,323 --> 00:27:20,323
Master.

724
00:27:20,522 --> 00:27:21,522
Sorry.

725
00:27:22,163 --> 00:27:24,643
My son was being rude.

726
00:27:25,323 --> 00:27:26,202
Sorry.

727
00:27:26,282 --> 00:27:27,122
Sorry.

728
00:27:27,202 --> 00:27:28,202
It's okay.

729
00:27:28,442 --> 00:27:29,803
As a practitioner,

730
00:27:30,202 --> 00:27:34,483
I am tolerant.

731
00:27:34,563 --> 00:27:38,043
- It's okay.
- We met by destiny.

732
00:27:38,123 --> 00:27:39,563
It's good that you understand me.

733
00:27:39,643 --> 00:27:40,682
Right.

734
00:27:41,363 --> 00:27:42,403
Well...

735
00:27:43,442 --> 00:27:46,323
You said earlier...

736
00:27:46,403 --> 00:27:48,363
How much does it cost?

737
00:27:48,922 --> 00:27:49,922
Madam.

738
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,962
It's not about money, but destiny.

739
00:27:53,002 --> 00:27:54,882
Destiny is something
we can't say for sure.

740
00:27:54,962 --> 00:27:55,564
Right.

741
00:27:55,644 --> 00:27:57,642
It's all about sincerity.

742
00:27:57,722 --> 00:27:59,442
- Right.
- If you're sincere,

743
00:28:00,403 --> 00:28:02,043
then it will surely succeed.

744
00:28:07,803 --> 00:28:08,803
It means...

745
00:28:09,202 --> 00:28:10,202
Surely succeed.

746
00:28:15,482 --> 00:28:16,482
Well...

747
00:28:18,442 --> 00:28:19,682
It means...

748
00:28:21,043 --> 00:28:22,043
Master.

749
00:28:22,762 --> 00:28:26,083
I have already made up my mind.

750
00:28:26,803 --> 00:28:27,803
Master.

751
00:28:28,643 --> 00:28:29,643
How's it?

752
00:28:37,163 --> 00:28:38,083
How's it?

753
00:28:38,163 --> 00:28:39,002
How's it going?

754
00:28:39,163 --> 00:28:40,442
For half an hour,

755
00:28:40,603 --> 00:28:41,324
she is

756
00:28:41,404 --> 00:28:43,002
either eating or talking.

757
00:28:44,043 --> 00:28:44,682
Chengyi.

758
00:28:44,762 --> 00:28:45,602
She is like this

759
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:46,682
with you?

760
00:28:49,803 --> 00:28:50,803
What a talent.

761
00:28:52,002 --> 00:28:53,163
Outrageous.

762
00:28:53,643 --> 00:28:55,163
How can he do that?

763
00:28:58,323 --> 00:28:59,323
Dad, Mom.

764
00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:01,163
Kaixin is a guest, you...

765
00:29:01,682 --> 00:29:02,682
Kaixin.

766
00:29:02,922 --> 00:29:04,722
Come visit us often.

767
00:29:05,002 --> 00:29:06,002
Rest assured.

768
00:29:06,242 --> 00:29:08,163
We can guarantee you

769
00:29:08,403 --> 00:29:10,563
Chengyi is not that kind of scumbag.

770
00:29:10,722 --> 00:29:12,163
He is nice and kind.

771
00:29:12,643 --> 00:29:13,723
Yu'an and Yule

772
00:29:13,803 --> 00:29:15,162
are naughty,

773
00:29:15,242 --> 00:29:15,883
but don't worry.

774
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,003
It feels like she already

775
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:18,642
won over Dad and Mom.

776
00:29:18,722 --> 00:29:20,083
If they really get out of hand,

777
00:29:20,163 --> 00:29:20,883
tell me,

778
00:29:20,963 --> 00:29:22,202
and I'll spank them.

779
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:23,524
Uncle, auntie,

780
00:29:23,604 --> 00:29:25,163
you two are really nice.

781
00:29:25,282 --> 00:29:26,842
I am really touched.

782
00:29:26,922 --> 00:29:27,643
Your family

783
00:29:27,723 --> 00:29:29,163
is really warm.

784
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:32,882
It's good if you like it.

785
00:29:32,962 --> 00:29:34,882
Can I often come to eat preserved egg?

786
00:29:34,962 --> 00:29:37,043
Okay.
We'll make the one with pork floss.

787
00:29:37,123 --> 00:29:38,123
Pretty good.

788
00:29:44,202 --> 00:29:45,442
Uncle and auntie

789
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:46,922
are too kind.

790
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:47,923
They gave me

791
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:49,363
more things.

792
00:29:49,563 --> 00:29:50,762
How embarrassing!

793
00:29:54,563 --> 00:29:55,922
Say goodbye. They're watching us.

794
00:30:07,323 --> 00:30:08,522
I didn't expect it.

795
00:30:10,522 --> 00:30:11,883
She is really nice.

796
00:30:14,442 --> 00:30:15,922
I'm really curious

797
00:30:16,202 --> 00:30:17,243
how you dealt with

798
00:30:17,323 --> 00:30:17,964
the two of them

799
00:30:18,044 --> 00:30:19,682
during only one meal.

800
00:30:19,962 --> 00:30:20,682
Well,

801
00:30:20,762 --> 00:30:21,484
he even doesn't

802
00:30:21,564 --> 00:30:22,682
treat Youyou that well.

803
00:30:23,202 --> 00:30:23,764
Did you

804
00:30:23,844 --> 00:30:24,963
drug them?

805
00:30:25,043 --> 00:30:26,323
Otherwise, there's no other way.

806
00:30:26,803 --> 00:30:27,842
Want to know why?

807
00:30:27,922 --> 00:30:28,922
Of course.

808
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,522
There is a condition.

809
00:30:30,603 --> 00:30:31,483
Then forget it.

810
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:32,563
It's very simple.

811
00:30:33,083 --> 00:30:34,083
Take me home.

812
00:30:34,962 --> 00:30:35,962
Let's go.

813
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:41,962
This is...

814
00:30:42,323 --> 00:30:43,563
What a nice girl.

815
00:30:44,163 --> 00:30:45,482
I really pity her.

816
00:30:46,323 --> 00:30:47,563
Exactly.

817
00:30:48,282 --> 00:30:50,243
I told you just go to

818
00:30:50,323 --> 00:30:51,004
the vague one.

819
00:30:51,084 --> 00:30:52,842
Yet you insisted on
the detailed version.

820
00:30:52,922 --> 00:30:54,163
What now?

821
00:30:56,043 --> 00:30:57,563
You two are so fickle.

822
00:30:57,762 --> 00:30:59,083
Just after a meal,

823
00:30:59,163 --> 00:31:01,002
you two have changed.

824
00:31:02,922 --> 00:31:04,202
We're accurate

825
00:31:04,282 --> 00:31:05,563
on people.

826
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:06,883
You should

827
00:31:06,963 --> 00:31:08,523
learn from Xu.

828
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:09,603
Look.

829
00:31:10,083 --> 00:31:10,923
Facing all setbacks,

830
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:12,563
she's still so optimistic and kind.

831
00:31:12,682 --> 00:31:14,803
If you were half as smart as Xu,

832
00:31:14,883 --> 00:31:15,763
your mom and I

833
00:31:15,843 --> 00:31:16,483
would be happy.

834
00:31:16,563 --> 00:31:17,563
Alright.

835
00:31:17,962 --> 00:31:19,762
Anyway, anyone is better than me.

836
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:21,282
You like her so much,

837
00:31:21,442 --> 00:31:22,962
why don't you make her your daughter?

838
00:31:29,323 --> 00:31:30,603
What's wrong with you?

839
00:31:30,962 --> 00:31:32,282
I didn't say anything wrong.

840
00:31:37,043 --> 00:31:37,883
Why do I feel

841
00:31:37,963 --> 00:31:39,202
something is off?

842
00:31:49,202 --> 00:31:50,403
Can you say it now?

843
00:31:51,123 --> 00:31:52,122
When you went there,

844
00:31:52,202 --> 00:31:53,043
the two of them

845
00:31:53,123 --> 00:31:53,764
didn't like you.

846
00:31:53,844 --> 00:31:55,243
Just one meal, why...?

847
00:31:55,323 --> 00:31:56,323
What's going on?

848
00:31:56,482 --> 00:31:58,122
Actually, I didn't do anything.

849
00:31:58,202 --> 00:31:59,763
The two of them

850
00:31:59,843 --> 00:32:01,482
are inherently kind.

851
00:32:02,603 --> 00:32:03,484
My previous marriage

852
00:32:03,564 --> 00:32:04,682
failed,

853
00:32:04,762 --> 00:32:06,803
but it taught me
how to distinguish people.

854
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:07,443
And,

855
00:32:07,523 --> 00:32:09,163
never exhaust myself.

856
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:12,363
The first time

857
00:32:12,443 --> 00:32:13,922
I met my former mother-in-law,

858
00:32:14,043 --> 00:32:15,962
she seemed very kind,

859
00:32:16,043 --> 00:32:16,723
and kept saying

860
00:32:16,803 --> 00:32:17,564
to treat me

861
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,323
as her own daughter.

862
00:32:19,442 --> 00:32:20,044
And then?

863
00:32:20,124 --> 00:32:21,882
My ex-husband cheated
during my pregnancy,

864
00:32:21,962 --> 00:32:24,002
and she joined forces
with him and the mistress

865
00:32:24,323 --> 00:32:25,362
to scheme against me,

866
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:26,882
making me leave with nothing.

867
00:32:26,962 --> 00:32:27,643
They paid nothing

868
00:32:27,723 --> 00:32:29,123
for the child support.

869
00:32:30,043 --> 00:32:30,643
One day,

870
00:32:30,723 --> 00:32:31,882
Dami got sick,

871
00:32:31,962 --> 00:32:32,683
and I had

872
00:32:32,763 --> 00:32:34,163
to beg them for help.

873
00:32:34,282 --> 00:32:36,283
They just gave me

874
00:32:36,363 --> 00:32:37,563
1,800 yuan

875
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:39,403
and slammed the door.

876
00:32:39,883 --> 00:32:40,922
So mean?

877
00:32:43,123 --> 00:32:45,682
Your parents-in-law
wanted to make things difficult for me,

878
00:32:45,762 --> 00:32:47,282
which is understandable.

879
00:32:47,682 --> 00:32:48,882
They just want to protect

880
00:32:48,962 --> 00:32:50,522
their daughter and granddaughters.

881
00:32:51,522 --> 00:32:52,962
If it were Lili,

882
00:32:53,282 --> 00:32:54,922
she would do the same.

883
00:32:56,123 --> 00:32:57,362
After they listened

884
00:32:57,442 --> 00:32:59,243
to my story,

885
00:32:59,323 --> 00:33:00,922
they were

886
00:33:01,002 --> 00:33:01,804
too kind

887
00:33:01,884 --> 00:33:03,282
to bully me.

888
00:33:03,563 --> 00:33:04,363
Moreover,

889
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,563
you brought a woman there.

890
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:07,964
It made them

891
00:33:08,044 --> 00:33:09,323
think of their own daughter,

892
00:33:09,722 --> 00:33:11,123
which is a bit sad.

893
00:33:12,522 --> 00:33:14,202
The best way to comfort someone

894
00:33:14,282 --> 00:33:15,922
is to reveal

895
00:33:16,002 --> 00:33:17,202
my own scars.

896
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:23,442
I'm so full.

897
00:33:23,522 --> 00:33:26,163
I am getting sleepy now.

898
00:33:37,442 --> 00:33:38,402
See, I told you.

899
00:33:38,482 --> 00:33:39,722
Yawning is contagious.

900
00:33:40,202 --> 00:33:42,122
Yes, it is contagious.

901
00:33:42,202 --> 00:33:43,682
It's all your fault.

902
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,256
(Turning right)

903
00:34:56,396 --> 00:34:59,544
(Ultrasound Room)

904
00:35:01,802 --> 00:35:02,523
Let me see.

905
00:35:02,603 --> 00:35:03,288
What happened?

906
00:35:03,288 --> 00:35:04,792
(Ultrasound report)
I asked the doctor

907
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:06,296
when the surgery can be performed.

908
00:35:06,296 --> 00:35:07,923
She said she needs other test results.

909
00:35:08,003 --> 00:35:09,802
That will take several days.

910
00:35:09,882 --> 00:35:10,923
Aunt, what should I do?

911
00:35:11,003 --> 00:35:12,963
I can't bear it for even a day.

912
00:35:13,043 --> 00:35:13,763
I'm anxious

913
00:35:13,843 --> 00:35:15,202
while carrying him.

914
00:35:17,202 --> 00:35:18,563
Don't be anxious.

915
00:35:18,643 --> 00:35:19,923
Listen to the doctor.

916
00:35:21,802 --> 00:35:22,923
Let's wait for the results.

917
00:35:23,563 --> 00:35:24,563
Let's go home.

918
00:35:25,603 --> 00:35:26,963
What should I do?

919
00:36:06,827 --> 00:36:08,768

How did I fall asleep?

934
00:37:09,603 --> 00:37:10,243
Sorry.

935
00:37:10,323 --> 00:37:12,003
I-I saw you fall asleep,

936
00:37:12,083 --> 00:37:13,923
so I didn't want to disturb you.

937
00:37:14,322 --> 00:37:15,603
And I fell asleep too.

938
00:37:18,083 --> 00:37:19,402
Your house is in here, right?

939
00:37:19,882 --> 00:37:20,882
Yes.

940
00:37:22,402 --> 00:37:23,402
It's past 4 PM.

941
00:37:23,603 --> 00:37:24,802
I should head back.

942
00:37:28,443 --> 00:37:29,603
Why can't I unfasten it?

943
00:37:29,963 --> 00:37:31,202
My car is a bit old.

944
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:33,176
-Why can't I pull it?
- Hold on, I'll help you.

945
00:37:45,003 --> 00:37:46,163
My car is a bit old.

946
00:37:53,043 --> 00:37:56,362
(Five, four, three, two, one.)

947
00:37:56,483 --> 00:37:57,483
(Come on.)

948
00:37:57,682 --> 00:37:58,882
(I have to kiss you then.)

949
00:38:05,802 --> 00:38:07,202
(Actually, what I want is)

950
00:38:07,282 --> 00:38:09,403
(to unfasten your seatbelt first,)

951
00:38:09,483 --> 00:38:11,722
(but it seems
it doesn't matter anymore.)

952
00:38:15,483 --> 00:38:16,563
Do you feel anything here?

953
00:38:16,643 --> 00:38:17,762
Do you feel a wave of heat

954
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:18,842
pushing downwards?

955
00:38:19,123 --> 00:38:20,762
I don't feel the heat.

956
00:38:20,842 --> 00:38:21,842
But it hurts.

957
00:38:22,483 --> 00:38:23,203
Doctor, maybe

958
00:38:23,283 --> 00:38:24,523
you've struck a nerve.

959
00:38:24,603 --> 00:38:25,762
Acupuncture is like this.

960
00:38:25,842 --> 00:38:26,842
Bear with it.

961
00:38:26,923 --> 00:38:28,483
Treating illness comes with pain.

962
00:38:28,882 --> 00:38:30,563
I am not afraid of pain.

963
00:38:31,163 --> 00:38:32,802
But how long will it take effect?

964
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:36,483
This is normal, you can't rush it.

965
00:38:56,242 --> 00:38:57,202
Grandma.

966
00:38:57,282 --> 00:38:58,282
Where's Dad?

967
00:38:58,402 --> 00:38:59,882
Why isn't he back yet?

968
00:39:00,322 --> 00:39:01,483
Exactly.

969
00:39:03,282 --> 00:39:04,642
Call Chengyi

970
00:39:04,722 --> 00:39:06,282
and ask him.

971
00:39:06,443 --> 00:39:07,682
It's rare for them

972
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,802
to have a chance to be intimate.

973
00:39:09,882 --> 00:39:10,883
If you call him,

974
00:39:10,963 --> 00:39:12,802
it'll ruin the vibe.

975
00:39:12,882 --> 00:39:13,763
Just call him.

976
00:39:13,843 --> 00:39:15,123
I saw it.

977
00:39:17,083 --> 00:39:18,083
Okay.

978
00:39:18,643 --> 00:39:19,643
Hurry up.

979
00:39:36,923 --> 00:39:38,083
Just a second.

980
00:39:38,163 --> 00:39:39,163
I'll take a call.

981
00:39:41,603 --> 00:39:42,603
My father-in-law.

982
00:39:45,643 --> 00:39:46,643
Dad.

983
00:39:47,402 --> 00:39:48,402
Chengyi.

984
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:50,762
It's nothing.

985
00:39:51,603 --> 00:39:52,802
I didn't disturb you, did I?

986
00:39:55,163 --> 00:39:56,163
That's good.

987
00:39:56,842 --> 00:39:57,484
I wanted to ask

988
00:39:57,564 --> 00:39:58,842
when you will come back.

989
00:39:59,043 --> 00:40:00,043
I'm on my way.

990
00:40:00,402 --> 00:40:02,123
Yes, there's a bit of traffic.

991
00:40:03,882 --> 00:40:04,443
Alright.

992
00:40:04,523 --> 00:40:05,282
Don't worry.

993
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:06,362
I'll be there soon.

994
00:40:07,603 --> 00:40:08,842
Alright.

995
00:40:09,083 --> 00:40:10,202
Drive safely.

996
00:40:12,762 --> 00:40:13,842
He's driving.

997
00:40:16,483 --> 00:40:18,402
Mei Chengyi, you're something.

998
00:40:20,882 --> 00:40:21,882
Shall we continue?

999
00:40:27,722 --> 00:40:28,722
Dad.

1000
00:40:29,362 --> 00:40:30,362
It's still me.

1001
00:40:30,682 --> 00:40:31,883
Right. There's an accident,

1002
00:40:31,963 --> 00:40:32,683
and

1003
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,923
I'm stuck in traffic.

1004
00:40:34,722 --> 00:40:35,923
Don't wait for me.

1005
00:40:36,282 --> 00:40:36,963
Alright.

1006
00:40:37,043 --> 00:40:38,043
Bye.

1007
00:40:40,483 --> 00:40:41,483
Wait...

1014
00:40:57,924 --> 00:40:59,242
comes to welcome me?

1015

Mom.

I'm back.

1017
00:41:04,362 --> 00:41:05,403
Did you miss me?

1018
00:41:05,483 --> 00:41:07,083
- Yes.
- Go play.

1019
00:41:10,123 --> 00:41:11,282
What are you doing here?

1020
00:41:12,202 --> 00:41:12,963
Can't you see?

1021
00:41:13,043 --> 00:41:14,643
I'm making dumplings here.

1022
00:41:15,443 --> 00:41:16,722
I want meat-filled ones.

1023
00:41:24,882 --> 00:41:26,443
There's something wrong with her.

You...

1025
00:42:18,443 --> 00:42:19,483
You guessed right.

1026
00:42:21,963 --> 00:42:22,963
You won the lottery?

1027
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:24,043
How much?

1028
00:42:24,123 --> 00:42:24,924
All you can

1029
00:42:25,004 --> 00:42:26,322
think of is money.

1030
00:42:26,402 --> 00:42:27,004
Can't you

1031
00:42:27,084 --> 00:42:28,443
think of something beautiful?

1032
00:42:28,923 --> 00:42:31,083
Men, for example.

1033
00:42:33,603 --> 00:42:34,603
Men?

1034
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:37,882
Who's that bold?

1035
00:42:38,643 --> 00:42:40,163
I know, it's him.

1036
00:42:46,923 --> 00:42:47,523
No way.

1037
00:42:47,603 --> 00:42:48,444
It is too fast.

1038
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,563
You need to slow down.

1039
00:42:49,643 --> 00:42:50,163
What?

1040
00:42:50,243 --> 00:42:51,682
We're not young.

still young?

1043
00:42:54,163 --> 00:42:55,163
Not fast at all.

1044
00:42:57,643 --> 00:42:58,643
Girl.

1045
00:42:58,923 --> 00:43:00,483
Look in the mirror.

1046
00:43:02,762 --> 00:43:03,843
Do I look

1047
00:43:03,923 --> 00:43:05,083
