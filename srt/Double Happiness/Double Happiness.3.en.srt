(Mr. You, I saw this at a restaurant.
Is he your eldest son-in-law?)

17
00:01:48,423 --> 00:01:50,102
I can't believe you, Mei Chengyi.

18
00:01:51,503 --> 00:01:53,382
My whole family
is watching your kids for you.

19
00:01:53,623 --> 00:01:54,462
And you

20
00:01:54,542 --> 00:01:56,143
went out on a date alone.

21
00:01:58,143 --> 00:01:59,583
I'll ruin it.

22
00:02:01,302 --> 00:02:02,503
Dad,

23
00:02:02,783 --> 00:02:05,343
my stomach hurts a lot.

24
00:02:05,423 --> 00:02:07,262
It really hurts.

25
00:02:08,422 --> 00:02:11,102
Dad, my stomach hurts.

26
00:02:11,582 --> 00:02:13,062
Your stomach doesn't hurt enough.

27
00:02:13,142 --> 00:02:14,342
Make it hurt a little more.

28
00:02:14,422 --> 00:02:16,622
Dad, my stomach really hurts.

29
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:17,982
Act exactly like this later.

30
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:19,582
And you, Yule.

31
00:02:19,903 --> 00:02:22,702
Dad, my stomach really hurts.

32
00:02:23,303 --> 00:02:24,183
Very good.

33
00:02:24,503 --> 00:02:25,342
Just like that.

34
00:02:25,422 --> 00:02:26,503
That's right.

35
00:02:26,702 --> 00:02:28,582
I will take whichever of you

36
00:02:29,382 --> 00:02:30,223
who performs well

37
00:02:30,343 --> 00:02:31,703
to the wildlife park

38
00:02:31,783 --> 00:02:33,302
next week.

39
00:02:33,382 --> 00:02:34,542
- Okay?
- Okay.

40
00:02:35,303 --> 00:02:36,102
Ms. Xu,

41
00:02:36,903 --> 00:02:38,582
Ms. Xiaoxiao suggested

42
00:02:38,662 --> 00:02:40,023
we meet.

43
00:02:41,023 --> 00:02:42,223
Please smile.

44
00:02:43,223 --> 00:02:44,023
Come over.

45
00:02:44,223 --> 00:02:44,902
Lean over.

46
00:02:44,982 --> 00:02:45,902
Come over and smile.

47
00:02:45,982 --> 00:02:46,743
Smile a bit.

48
00:02:54,102 --> 00:02:55,582
I must take a photo.

49
00:02:56,262 --> 00:02:56,943
You are

50
00:02:57,183 --> 00:02:59,062
kind of a quality choice

51
00:02:59,142 --> 00:03:00,463
among my blind date candidates.

52
00:03:01,422 --> 00:03:02,662
This is for keepsake.

53
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:04,862
Yes.

54
00:03:05,303 --> 00:03:07,023
That's pretty good.

55
00:03:08,662 --> 00:03:09,982
So should we...

56
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:11,302
How about this?

57
00:03:11,382 --> 00:03:12,582
Let's first

58
00:03:13,142 --> 00:03:14,582
introduce ourselves.

59
00:03:16,503 --> 00:03:18,103
This wine is great.

60
00:03:18,183 --> 00:03:18,782
You know what?

61
00:03:18,862 --> 00:03:19,703
I saw online

62
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:20,622
that this place's

63
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:22,183
rating is about 3.6.

64
00:03:22,303 --> 00:03:23,182
No wonder people say

65
00:03:23,262 --> 00:03:24,383
the wine at a restaurant

66
00:03:24,463 --> 00:03:25,662
of this tier is the best.

67
00:03:25,982 --> 00:03:26,742
You must try it.

68
00:03:26,822 --> 00:03:27,383
No.

69
00:03:27,463 --> 00:03:29,623
Ms. Xu, let's talk
about something serious.

70
00:03:29,903 --> 00:03:30,822
Can we talk about

71
00:03:31,943 --> 00:03:33,183
something a bit more in-depth?

72
00:03:34,943 --> 00:03:36,023
(More in-depth?)

73
00:03:36,142 --> 00:03:37,783
(Is it what I think it means?)

74
00:03:38,102 --> 00:03:38,782
(Does he always)

75
00:03:38,862 --> 00:03:40,063
(scam women this blatantly?)

76
00:03:41,102 --> 00:03:42,863
(Why is she staring straight)

77
00:03:42,943 --> 00:03:43,662
(at me?)

78
00:03:45,023 --> 00:03:46,183
(Why isn't she speaking?)

79
00:03:47,662 --> 00:03:49,262
(Is she dumb or something?)

80
00:03:52,822 --> 00:03:53,623
Ms. Xu?

81
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:56,702
In-depth, right?

82
00:03:56,783 --> 00:03:57,703
Let's go in-depth.

83
00:03:57,783 --> 00:03:58,623
Let's do it.

84
00:04:00,503 --> 00:04:01,463
Okay.

85
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:03,703
Let's save some time.

86
00:04:03,783 --> 00:04:05,023
I'll ask directly, then.

87
00:04:05,783 --> 00:04:07,103
How did your last marriage

88
00:04:07,183 --> 00:04:08,103
end?

89
00:04:08,183 --> 00:04:09,303
The scoundrel cheated on me.

90
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:11,023
And you?

91
00:04:11,382 --> 00:04:12,823
My wife got sick

92
00:04:12,903 --> 00:04:13,983
and died three years ago.

93
00:04:14,063 --> 00:04:15,223
We were college classmates.

94
00:04:15,303 --> 00:04:17,022
And we had been deeply in love.

95
00:04:17,183 --> 00:04:18,583
I highly value the purity

96
00:04:18,663 --> 00:04:19,663
of a relationship.

97
00:04:20,183 --> 00:04:21,262
If I were to remarry,

98
00:04:21,342 --> 00:04:22,983
I hope it would be for love.

99
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:26,543
(A suitcase of sex toys
on a business trip?)

100
00:04:27,303 --> 00:04:30,022
(How dare you talk
about the purity of a relationship?)

101
00:04:30,902 --> 00:04:32,462
What about you, Ms. Xu?

102
00:04:32,582 --> 00:04:33,783
What are your requirements

103
00:04:33,863 --> 00:04:34,663
for a spouse?

104
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,462
My requirements are quite simple.

105
00:04:38,142 --> 00:04:39,262
I'm looking

106
00:04:39,342 --> 00:04:41,103
for a high-quality family partner.

107
00:04:41,543 --> 00:04:42,382
Family partner?

108
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:43,182
Well,

109
00:04:43,262 --> 00:04:44,103
to form a family

110
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:45,663
is not like a business partnership.

111
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:47,782
A family is a place
where love is needed.

112
00:04:48,743 --> 00:04:49,863
(Under the guise of love,)

113
00:04:49,943 --> 00:04:51,582
(tricking a silly girl to be a maid,)

114
00:04:51,863 --> 00:04:53,863
(all scumbags in the world
are the same.)

115
00:04:56,142 --> 00:04:56,943
Listen.

116
00:04:57,262 --> 00:04:58,382
What we call love

117
00:04:58,462 --> 00:05:00,503
is the most lacking
in contractual spirit.

118
00:05:00,702 --> 00:05:01,382
Love can start

119
00:05:01,462 --> 00:05:02,223
and end wishfully,

120
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:03,582
making people fall out.

121
00:05:03,902 --> 00:05:05,262
I don't want to marry

122
00:05:05,342 --> 00:05:07,182
and divorce repeatedly. Gradually,

123
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:07,983
it'll waste

124
00:05:08,063 --> 00:05:09,583
my courage for life

125
00:05:09,663 --> 00:05:10,382
and marriage.

126
00:05:10,863 --> 00:05:11,583
So,

127
00:05:11,663 --> 00:05:12,863
I think to get married

128
00:05:12,943 --> 00:05:13,822
is to find

129
00:05:13,902 --> 00:05:16,583
a quality family partner
with a spirit of contract.

130
00:05:16,663 --> 00:05:18,663
In this way, we can eat, play, and drink

131
00:05:18,743 --> 00:05:19,343
together.

132
00:05:19,423 --> 00:05:20,903
When we're drunk, we can feel brave

133
00:05:20,983 --> 00:05:22,142
and challenge tigers. Cheers.

134
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:23,342
Wait. Stop.

135
00:05:23,943 --> 00:05:24,543
It sounds like

136
00:05:24,623 --> 00:05:26,302
you're looking for a buddy,

137
00:05:26,382 --> 00:05:27,543
not a husband.

138
00:05:27,743 --> 00:05:28,543
See?

139
00:05:29,423 --> 00:05:30,863
You don't understand again.

140
00:05:31,183 --> 00:05:32,663
Among all the couples in the world

141
00:05:32,863 --> 00:05:33,863
with their marriages

142
00:05:33,943 --> 00:05:35,663
lasting over seven years,

143
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:36,702
70 to 80 percent

144
00:05:36,782 --> 00:05:38,702
of them end up becoming sworn brothers.

145
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:39,583
So

146
00:05:39,663 --> 00:05:40,702
I need a buddy

147
00:05:41,022 --> 00:05:41,583
who can also

148
00:05:41,663 --> 00:05:44,023
fulfill those duties

149
00:05:44,103 --> 00:05:45,343
between husband and wife...

150
00:05:45,423 --> 00:05:46,583
You...

151
00:05:46,663 --> 00:05:47,583
You know

152
00:05:47,663 --> 00:05:48,983
what I mean, right?

153
00:05:49,663 --> 00:05:51,103
Wait. What I mean...

154
00:05:51,183 --> 00:05:52,142
Of course,

155
00:05:52,222 --> 00:05:53,822
for those with a spirit of contract,

156
00:05:53,902 --> 00:05:55,063
regardless of gender,

157
00:05:55,342 --> 00:05:56,423
they can only have

158
00:05:56,503 --> 00:05:57,743
one friend of the opposite sex,

159
00:05:58,063 --> 00:06:00,183
that is, his wife or husband.

160
00:06:02,423 --> 00:06:03,222
Alright.

161
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:05,503
It's pretty good.

162
00:06:06,582 --> 00:06:08,063
Your phone is ringing.

163
00:06:09,943 --> 00:06:11,303
Sorry, I need to take this.

164
00:06:13,543 --> 00:06:14,103
Hello?

165
00:06:16,382 --> 00:06:17,503
She went to her dad's place.

166
00:06:18,022 --> 00:06:18,983
She's almost there.

167
00:06:19,063 --> 00:06:20,582
She called me and told me just now.

168
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:22,423
S-Stop what?

169
00:06:22,503 --> 00:06:24,103
Can you really stop this?

170
00:06:24,462 --> 00:06:25,302
If you stop her,

171
00:06:25,382 --> 00:06:25,983
she displays

172
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:27,343
a vigorous fighting spirit

173
00:06:27,423 --> 00:06:28,262
against the world.

174
00:06:28,342 --> 00:06:28,983
I'm telling you.

175
00:06:29,063 --> 00:06:30,223
Some setbacks are necessary.

176
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:31,543
Kids learn faster by stumbling.

177
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,142
Alright, just let it be.

178
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,342
Ms. Xu,

179
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,382
may I ask a question?

180
00:06:39,663 --> 00:06:40,942
You were talking

181
00:06:41,022 --> 00:06:42,782
about your kid and her father, right?

182
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:44,503
So?

183
00:06:46,103 --> 00:06:46,902
Well...

184
00:06:47,582 --> 00:06:48,783
Logically speaking,

185
00:06:48,863 --> 00:06:50,863
I shouldn't get involved

186
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:51,943
in your family matters.

187
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:52,822
But we're

188
00:06:52,902 --> 00:06:54,183
both single parents.

189
00:06:54,663 --> 00:06:55,903
In parenting,

190
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:56,742
mindset

191
00:06:56,822 --> 00:06:58,063
matters a lot.

192
00:07:03,702 --> 00:07:04,702
I think

193
00:07:04,983 --> 00:07:06,223
you should instill your kid

194
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:08,663
with negative thoughts about her father.

195
00:07:08,943 --> 00:07:09,783
If you do that,

196
00:07:09,863 --> 00:07:11,303
in her heart...

197
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:12,702
Mr. Mei,

198
00:07:13,582 --> 00:07:14,343
do you admit

199
00:07:14,423 --> 00:07:15,863
the diversity of life?

200
00:07:17,382 --> 00:07:18,423
Of course. Why?

201
00:07:18,503 --> 00:07:20,223
Not all parents in the world

202
00:07:20,303 --> 00:07:21,702
love their kids.

203
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:22,863
Deceiving them

204
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:23,783
with white lies

205
00:07:23,863 --> 00:07:24,983
will only make them hope

206
00:07:25,063 --> 00:07:26,702
and disappoint more. Instead,

207
00:07:26,782 --> 00:07:27,702
I hope my kids

208
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:28,942
can gradually learn

209
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:30,583
from setbacks when growing up

210
00:07:30,663 --> 00:07:31,663
so that they can have

211
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:33,462
the courage to face real future life.

212
00:07:33,743 --> 00:07:34,302
Alright.

213
00:07:34,382 --> 00:07:35,863
I can't win the argument with you.

214
00:07:36,063 --> 00:07:37,943
(Father-in-law)
Well, I need to take this call.

215
00:07:43,743 --> 00:07:44,582
Hello, Dad?

216
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:45,822
Hello?

217
00:07:46,503 --> 00:07:47,863
Hello, Chengyi.

218
00:07:48,782 --> 00:07:50,342
(Chengyi.)
Hurry back now.

219
00:07:50,863 --> 00:07:52,783
- Yu'an, no...
- My stomachache hurts.

220
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:53,782
- Yule...
- It hurts.

221
00:07:53,943 --> 00:07:54,743
No.

222
00:07:54,863 --> 00:07:55,543
Both of them

223
00:07:55,623 --> 00:07:57,302
have stomachaches at the same time.

224
00:07:57,382 --> 00:07:58,423
I don't know why.

225
00:07:58,503 --> 00:07:59,583
Dad, I...

226
00:07:59,663 --> 00:08:00,222
Grandfather,

227
00:08:00,342 --> 00:08:02,142
can we go to the wildlife park now?

228
00:08:02,503 --> 00:08:03,343
Hello? Hello?

229
00:08:03,423 --> 00:08:04,702
It's nothing.

230
00:08:05,342 --> 00:08:06,543
Okay, then.

231
00:08:06,623 --> 00:08:08,503
I'll go back right away.

232
00:08:09,863 --> 00:08:10,702
Alright.

233
00:08:13,902 --> 00:08:14,702
(YOYO)
(Chengyi.)

234
00:08:14,822 --> 00:08:16,303
(My dad knows about your date today.)

235
00:08:16,702 --> 00:08:17,783
(Yu'an and Yule lied about)

236
00:08:17,863 --> 00:08:18,782
(the stomachaches.)

237
00:08:19,222 --> 00:08:20,983
(Enjoy your date.)

238
00:08:26,303 --> 00:08:27,582
I can't believe this old man.

239
00:08:40,263 --> 00:08:41,063
Ms. Xu.

240
00:08:41,702 --> 00:08:43,863
Well, my kids suddenly feel unwell.

241
00:08:43,943 --> 00:08:44,982
I need to go.

242
00:08:45,543 --> 00:08:46,982
Okay, no problem.

243
00:08:47,183 --> 00:08:48,463
Since it's evenly split,

244
00:08:48,543 --> 00:08:49,183
can I

245
00:08:49,263 --> 00:08:50,103
pack my portion

246
00:08:50,183 --> 00:08:50,982
to go?

247
00:08:51,582 --> 00:08:52,262
Of course.

248
00:08:52,342 --> 00:08:53,582
Waitress, a packing box.

249
00:08:53,702 --> 00:08:54,582
Okay, sir.

250
00:09:38,023 --> 00:09:39,223
(Mei Chengyi)
(I'm afraid Ms. Xu and I)

251
00:09:39,303 --> 00:09:40,343
(are totally incompatible)

252
00:09:40,423 --> 00:09:41,263
(in values.)

253
00:09:42,063 --> 00:09:42,622
(Please)

254
00:09:42,702 --> 00:09:44,103
(convey it tactfully for me.)

255
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,582
Quite self-aware.

256
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:46,262
You're unworthy

257
00:09:46,342 --> 00:09:47,423
of Xu Kaixin at all.

258
00:09:48,383 --> 00:09:49,303
(Li Xiaoxiao)
(Okay, Mr. Mei.)

259
00:09:49,383 --> 00:09:50,103
(Rest assured.)

260
00:09:50,183 --> 00:09:51,502
(The customer is always right.)

261
00:09:51,742 --> 00:09:53,582
(We'll handle everything subsequently.)

262
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:56,902
(Next time,)

263
00:09:56,982 --> 00:09:58,382
(before you refer someone to me,)

264
00:09:58,462 --> 00:09:59,822
(conduct an initial screening)

265
00:10:00,102 --> 00:10:00,742
(to avoid)

266
00:10:00,822 --> 00:10:02,423
(wasting both sides' time and money.)

267
00:10:19,222 --> 00:10:20,263
And most importantly,

268
00:10:20,582 --> 00:10:21,303
I don't like

269
00:10:21,383 --> 00:10:23,063
a neurotic and talkative woman.

270
00:10:23,143 --> 00:10:25,702
Also, she's realistic and harsh.

271
00:10:25,903 --> 00:10:27,223
I hope my partner

272
00:10:27,303 --> 00:10:30,303
understands love,
dares to love, and is gentle.

273
00:10:30,543 --> 00:10:32,702
She should be cultured
and sophisticated.

274
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:34,262
At least she won't instigate

275
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,342
the relationship between a kid
and their father.

276
00:10:36,702 --> 00:10:38,183
For anyone,

277
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:39,782
she should be gentle,

278
00:10:39,862 --> 00:10:41,303
understanding, and tolerant.

279
00:10:41,622 --> 00:10:42,422
Anyway,

280
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:44,582
if you recommend another woman
to me next time,

281
00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:46,342
well,

282
00:10:46,903 --> 00:10:48,303
how should I put it?

283
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,183
You should pick someone

284
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:51,943
who is the exact opposite

285
00:10:52,023 --> 00:10:52,903
of Ms. Xu.

286
00:10:54,663 --> 00:10:55,183
Also, I have

287
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:56,142
already deleted her

288
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:56,823
to avoid

289
00:10:56,903 --> 00:10:58,783
our time and life.

290
00:11:00,063 --> 00:11:01,463
I-I really don't know

291
00:11:01,543 --> 00:11:02,502
how to express it.

292
00:11:02,663 --> 00:11:04,102
In short, I just don't like her.

293
00:11:08,783 --> 00:11:09,582
What is all this?

294
00:11:15,502 --> 00:11:16,943
In short, I just don't like her.

295
00:11:19,502 --> 00:11:21,303
Are you done yet?

296
00:11:26,439 --> 00:11:27,352
(A Second Chance)

297
00:11:30,102 --> 00:11:30,903
Hello?

298
00:11:31,502 --> 00:11:32,142
You're just

299
00:11:32,222 --> 00:11:33,262
a scumbag and womanizer

300
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:34,502
who travels with condoms.

301
00:11:34,582 --> 00:11:35,183
How dare you

302
00:11:35,263 --> 00:11:36,022
despise Xu Kaixin?

303
00:11:36,102 --> 00:11:37,022
Save it.

304
00:11:37,102 --> 00:11:37,742
Don't act

305
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,422
all high and mighty in that human skin.

306
00:11:39,502 --> 00:11:40,223
Do you think she

307
00:11:40,303 --> 00:11:41,223
wanted to eat with you?

308
00:11:41,303 --> 00:11:41,902
You should

309
00:11:41,982 --> 00:11:42,863
be honored she did.

310
00:11:42,943 --> 00:11:43,703
Listen to me.

311
00:11:43,783 --> 00:11:44,782
For a turn-off like you,

312
00:11:44,862 --> 00:11:46,142
even if you kneel to Xu Kaixin,

313
00:11:46,222 --> 00:11:46,863
she wouldn't

314
00:11:46,943 --> 00:11:47,502
look at you,

315
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:48,343
as she has known

316
00:11:48,423 --> 00:11:49,343
your true colors.

317
00:11:49,423 --> 00:11:50,542
Now get lost.

318
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:51,783
Don't approach my bestie.

319
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:28,184
(Li Xiaoxiao: Please collect 3,600 yuan)

320
00:12:28,342 --> 00:12:29,143
(3,600 collected)
Alright.

321
00:12:31,943 --> 00:12:32,742
What's all this?

322
00:12:47,903 --> 00:12:49,622
Hello, Xu Kaixin.

323
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:51,622
I'm furious.

324
00:12:51,742 --> 00:12:53,822
See you at the usual spot in 20 minutes.

325
00:13:00,502 --> 00:13:01,582
Don't you think he's silly?

326
00:13:02,263 --> 00:13:03,063
How come...

327
00:13:03,143 --> 00:13:05,222
How come he's holding a water gun?

328
00:13:07,102 --> 00:13:07,903
Qian Hao.

329
00:13:09,383 --> 00:13:10,622
What is this?

330
00:13:10,982 --> 00:13:11,742
Qian Hao.

331
00:13:12,982 --> 00:13:13,742
Qian Hao!

332
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:15,783
Come over here.

333
00:13:16,263 --> 00:13:17,263
I'm going.

334
00:13:22,183 --> 00:13:22,943
What's wrong?

335
00:13:23,023 --> 00:13:23,822
Honey,

336
00:13:24,143 --> 00:13:25,222
look at my hand.

337
00:13:26,622 --> 00:13:27,343
My manicure

338
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,663
is ruined from the cooking.

339
00:13:29,663 --> 00:13:30,943
It breaks my heart.

340
00:13:31,303 --> 00:13:32,102
I mean it.

341
00:13:32,423 --> 00:13:33,183
But your hands

342
00:13:33,263 --> 00:13:34,063
are beautiful.

343
00:13:34,143 --> 00:13:35,982
Everything else
is superfluous decoration.

344
00:13:36,063 --> 00:13:37,063
Cut it.

345
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:38,542
You and your mom

346
00:13:38,622 --> 00:13:40,703
were laughing out loud over there.

347
00:13:40,783 --> 00:13:41,583
And I'm like a maid,

348
00:13:41,663 --> 00:13:43,342
cooking all by myself here.

349
00:13:43,783 --> 00:13:44,463
It's a chance

350
00:13:44,543 --> 00:13:45,542
for you to perform well,

351
00:13:45,622 --> 00:13:47,063
so my mom can like you more.

352
00:13:47,143 --> 00:13:47,863
She dislikes me

353
00:13:47,943 --> 00:13:48,703
no matter what.

354
00:13:48,783 --> 00:13:50,462
Why should I kiss up to her?

355
00:13:51,742 --> 00:13:52,343
Before we

356
00:13:52,423 --> 00:13:53,662
got married, didn't you say

357
00:13:53,742 --> 00:13:54,262
you'd treat

358
00:13:54,342 --> 00:13:55,582
my parents as your own?

359
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:57,582
That's right.

360
00:13:57,702 --> 00:13:58,303
Every time you

361
00:13:58,383 --> 00:13:59,343
go to my uncle's place,

362
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,343
it's my uncle and aunt

363
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,742
who cook in the kitchen,

364
00:14:01,822 --> 00:14:02,662
and we lie there,

365
00:14:02,742 --> 00:14:03,622
eating while watching.

366
00:14:04,102 --> 00:14:04,863
Right.

367
00:14:04,943 --> 00:14:05,583
I should treat

368
00:14:05,663 --> 00:14:07,343
- your mom like I treat them.
- Alright.

369
00:14:07,423 --> 00:14:08,463
I'm not wearing this.

370
00:14:08,543 --> 00:14:09,703
Stop making a fuss.

371
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:10,823
What are you doing?

372
00:14:10,903 --> 00:14:12,103
Mother-in-law and uncle

373
00:14:12,183 --> 00:14:13,222
aren't the same thing.

374
00:14:13,502 --> 00:14:14,463
Then what do you want?

375
00:14:14,543 --> 00:14:16,222
You and your mom
grabbed all the benefits.

376
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:21,622
Hu Xiaojiao,

377
00:14:21,702 --> 00:14:22,583
don't act like a baby.

378
00:14:22,663 --> 00:14:23,783
You're not cute anymore.

379
00:14:25,102 --> 00:14:25,943
Then why you...

380
00:14:26,102 --> 00:14:26,703
You were nicer

381
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,022
to me when we were abroad.

382
00:14:28,102 --> 00:14:29,582
What did you promise to my uncle?

383
00:14:30,342 --> 00:14:30,863
Are you using

384
00:14:30,943 --> 00:14:32,342
your uncle to pressure me again?

385
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:33,742
I'm not.

386
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:34,543
No.

387
00:14:36,423 --> 00:14:37,142
Dad.

388
00:14:37,222 --> 00:14:38,023
Dad.

389
00:14:43,543 --> 00:14:44,543
What's with your face?

390
00:14:46,383 --> 00:14:47,183
Nothing.

391
00:14:47,622 --> 00:14:48,822
I accidentally fell.

392
00:14:49,023 --> 00:14:49,982
You fell?

393
00:14:50,943 --> 00:14:52,383
What do you mean, you fell?

394
00:14:52,502 --> 00:14:54,423
Look at your face.

395
00:14:54,702 --> 00:14:55,303
You must

396
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:56,343
did bad thing.

397
00:14:56,423 --> 00:14:58,543
You flirted around and got beaten.

398
00:14:59,263 --> 00:15:00,943
No need for harsh words, okay?

399
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:02,983
I'll be honest with you.

400
00:15:03,063 --> 00:15:03,863
Xiaomei and I

401
00:15:03,943 --> 00:15:05,663
are purely dancing partners.

402
00:15:05,903 --> 00:15:07,103
Her husband is petty

403
00:15:07,183 --> 00:15:08,183
and falsely accused me.

404
00:15:08,303 --> 00:15:09,142
I'm innocent.

405
00:15:09,222 --> 00:15:10,423
What do you mean, innocent?

406
00:15:10,982 --> 00:15:12,582
He falsely accused you?

407
00:15:12,742 --> 00:15:13,742
Look at you.

408
00:15:13,822 --> 00:15:14,463
At such an age,

409
00:15:14,543 --> 00:15:15,943
why did you get a dance partner?

410
00:15:16,023 --> 00:15:16,662
At a young age,

411
00:15:16,742 --> 00:15:17,742
you never settled down.

412
00:15:17,822 --> 00:15:19,543
You flirted around all day long.

413
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:20,463
As a doctor,

414
00:15:20,543 --> 00:15:21,662
you were entangled

415
00:15:21,742 --> 00:15:22,583
with nurses.

416
00:15:22,663 --> 00:15:24,583
Now you've gotten yourself
a dance partner.

417
00:15:24,663 --> 00:15:25,822
You deserve it.

418
00:15:25,943 --> 00:15:27,742
You deserve to be beaten.

419
00:15:27,822 --> 00:15:29,263
Dad, this is your fault.

420
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:30,583
If you keep doing this,

421
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:31,542
I'll send you

422
00:15:31,622 --> 00:15:32,622
to a nursing home.

423
00:15:34,383 --> 00:15:36,422
I just like to participate

424
00:15:36,502 --> 00:15:38,023
in some community activities.

425
00:15:38,423 --> 00:15:39,463
What's wrong

426
00:15:39,543 --> 00:15:40,423
with me dancing?

427
00:15:41,063 --> 00:15:41,862
Your mom

428
00:15:41,943 --> 00:15:42,742
doesn't get me.

429
00:15:42,822 --> 00:15:44,023
Do you also not understand me?

430
00:15:44,263 --> 00:15:45,583
For all these years,

431
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,703
we haven't divorced.

432
00:15:46,783 --> 00:15:47,982
- Right?
- Wait.

433
00:15:48,383 --> 00:15:49,263
Don't say anything.

434
00:15:49,423 --> 00:15:50,943
Don't drag my son into this.

435
00:15:51,023 --> 00:15:52,462
My son has nothing to do with you.

436
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:53,543
He's handsome.

437
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:55,382
So girls throw themselves at him.

438
00:15:55,462 --> 00:15:57,023
It can't be helped, right?

439
00:15:57,263 --> 00:15:57,782
And you?

440
00:15:57,862 --> 00:15:58,902
At such an old age,

441
00:15:58,982 --> 00:15:59,662
you've still

442
00:15:59,742 --> 00:16:00,742
gotten a dancing partner

443
00:16:00,822 --> 00:16:02,063
called Xiaomei.

444
00:16:02,143 --> 00:16:03,422
It's the same thing.

445
00:16:03,502 --> 00:16:04,422
You can't blame me.

446
00:16:04,502 --> 00:16:05,423
It can't be helped.

447
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,142
This batch of goods
is a high-end import.

448
00:16:09,222 --> 00:16:10,622
The quality is beyond question.

449
00:16:11,742 --> 00:16:12,862
G-Goods inspection?

450
00:16:13,702 --> 00:16:15,143
The inspection is being processed.

451
00:16:15,582 --> 00:16:16,502
There'll be no problem.

452
00:16:16,582 --> 00:16:17,582
It'll be done next week.

453
00:16:18,783 --> 00:16:19,903
Don't you believe me?

454
00:16:21,222 --> 00:16:22,063
Once the license

455
00:16:22,143 --> 00:16:23,543
is ready, I'll tell you, okay?

456
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:24,823
There's no problem at all.

457
00:16:24,903 --> 00:16:26,222
Trust me, okay?

458
00:16:27,023 --> 00:16:28,303
Alright, bye-bye.

459
00:16:32,303 --> 00:16:33,423
Are you still upset?

460
00:16:37,342 --> 00:16:39,542
Just take pity on me, okay?

461
00:16:39,622 --> 00:16:41,502
My dad was acting like that.

462
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:44,742
Then tell me.

463
00:16:45,143 --> 00:16:45,943
Is what your dad

464
00:16:46,023 --> 00:16:47,063
said tonight true?

465
00:16:47,663 --> 00:16:48,462
Which part?

466
00:16:49,943 --> 00:16:50,742
He said he cheated

467
00:16:50,822 --> 00:16:52,782
because of your family's DNA.

468
00:16:52,862 --> 00:16:54,662
That's why you abandoned Xu Kaixin

469
00:16:54,742 --> 00:16:55,742
to be with me.

470
00:16:55,822 --> 00:16:57,103
If you meet someone else,

471
00:16:57,183 --> 00:16:58,063
will you abandon me?

472
00:16:58,143 --> 00:16:59,423
Nonsense.

473
00:16:59,622 --> 00:17:00,622
Listen to me.

474
00:17:00,783 --> 00:17:01,583
I left her

475
00:17:01,663 --> 00:17:03,343
to be with you because I was late-mature

476
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:04,142
in love.

477
00:17:04,222 --> 00:17:05,222
After marrying her,

478
00:17:05,302 --> 00:17:06,663
I realized who I truly love.

479
00:17:07,702 --> 00:17:09,143
I may have failed Xu Kaixin,

480
00:17:09,302 --> 00:17:10,063
but I will never

481
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,062
let you down.

482
00:17:12,502 --> 00:17:13,343
I swear.

483
00:17:17,222 --> 00:17:18,143
Swear again.

484
00:17:19,903 --> 00:17:21,742
I swear to the heavens.

485
00:17:24,423 --> 00:17:25,063
Really?

486
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:25,823
Yes.

487
00:17:26,542 --> 00:17:27,222
Believe me.

488
00:17:27,302 --> 00:17:28,063
Don't be upset.

489
00:17:28,143 --> 00:17:29,023
Alright?

490
00:17:29,103 --> 00:17:30,222
It makes you less pretty.

491
00:17:30,302 --> 00:17:31,383
Forgive me, alright?

492
00:17:31,502 --> 00:17:32,462
Let's try again tonight.

493
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:34,062
Then I'll truly forgive you.

494
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:38,423
Honey?

495
00:17:40,423 --> 00:17:41,863
Okay, let's try it.

496
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:44,863
Dad.

497
00:17:52,062 --> 00:17:53,062
Why are you here?

498
00:18:08,663 --> 00:18:10,183
We are home.

499
00:18:11,183 --> 00:18:12,382
Dami, you haven't been here

500
00:18:12,462 --> 00:18:13,302
for long, right?

501
00:18:18,103 --> 00:18:18,982
Come on in.

502
00:18:19,062 --> 00:18:19,863
Come on.

503
00:18:21,528 --> 00:18:22,543
Why didn't you call me

504
00:18:22,623 --> 00:18:23,943
before you came?

505
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,343
I called you in the afternoon.

506
00:18:25,423 --> 00:18:26,343
You didn't answer.

507
00:18:26,462 --> 00:18:27,583
By night, my phone watch

508
00:18:27,663 --> 00:18:28,742
was out of battery.

509
00:18:30,062 --> 00:18:31,462
Does your mom know you're here?

510
00:18:31,542 --> 00:18:32,142
Yes.

511
00:18:32,222 --> 00:18:33,222
My mom said

512
00:18:33,302 --> 00:18:35,222
I can stay as long as I want.

513
00:18:35,302 --> 00:18:36,262
Is that okay, Dad?

514
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:38,343
No problem.

515
00:18:39,262 --> 00:18:40,982
You can stay as long as you want.

516
00:18:41,183 --> 00:18:41,982
Hold on.

517
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:45,823
How long will she stay?

518
00:18:46,022 --> 00:18:47,263
I didn't know she was coming.

519
00:18:47,343 --> 00:18:48,183
You know?

520
00:18:48,663 --> 00:18:49,382
Dad, isn't this

521
00:18:49,462 --> 00:18:51,143
the room I used to live in?

522
00:18:51,903 --> 00:18:52,622
That's right.

523
00:18:52,702 --> 00:18:53,423
Look at you.

524
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:54,583
You have a good memory.

525
00:18:54,663 --> 00:18:55,263
Inside here

526
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,863
is still a room.

527
00:18:56,943 --> 00:18:58,222
This is a hidden door.

528
00:18:59,742 --> 00:19:00,942
But now this place

529
00:19:01,022 --> 00:19:02,823
is Ms. Xiaojiao's dressing room.

530
00:19:02,982 --> 00:19:03,662
The thing is,

531
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:04,863
I didn't know you'd come.

532
00:19:05,302 --> 00:19:05,863
Later,

533
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:07,583
we'll change this place

534
00:19:07,663 --> 00:19:09,343
into a room for you and your brother.

535
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:10,343
Okay.

536
00:19:11,542 --> 00:19:12,743
Tonight,

537
00:19:12,823 --> 00:19:14,182
just make do on the sofa.

538
00:19:14,262 --> 00:19:15,022
Okay?

539
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:17,383
Good girl.

540
00:19:17,863 --> 00:19:18,422
Dad,

541
00:19:18,502 --> 00:19:20,583
can you sleep with me tonight?

542
00:19:20,823 --> 00:19:21,623
I...

543
00:19:23,623 --> 00:19:25,022
N-No problem.

544
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:27,583

551
00:19:51,343 --> 00:19:52,343
Hurry up.

552
00:19:52,423 --> 00:19:53,422
Two beers first.

553
00:19:53,502 --> 00:19:55,663
This is my best friend.

554
00:19:56,623 --> 00:19:57,662
Get her a dozen.

555
00:19:57,742 --> 00:19:58,942
No, just two beers.

556
00:19:59,022 --> 00:20:00,462
I'm paying, so I get to decide.

557
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:01,583
Come on, Kaixin.

558
00:20:06,502 --> 00:20:07,343
Kaixin.

559
00:20:09,222 --> 00:20:10,863
I really miss you.

560
00:20:12,343 --> 00:20:13,183
Give me a kiss.

561
00:20:13,742 --> 00:20:14,583
Give me one.

562
00:20:15,742 --> 00:20:17,142
Alright.

563
00:20:17,222 --> 00:20:18,982
I'm wearing makeup.

564
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:21,583
What is this for?

565
00:20:22,022 --> 00:20:22,823
Kaixin,

566
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,863
you know I love you a lot, right?

567
00:20:26,943 --> 00:20:29,262
I love you a lot.

568
00:20:31,222 --> 00:20:32,022
Kaixin,

569
00:20:33,903 --> 00:20:35,742
no one can bully you.

570
00:20:36,343 --> 00:20:37,462
You're so nice.

571
00:20:40,302 --> 00:20:41,663
If you can't find a good man,

572
00:20:41,863 --> 00:20:43,183
let's not look anymore.

573
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:45,663
We don't want men anymore.

574
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,383
Okay?

575
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:48,583
Your name means happy.

576
00:20:48,943 --> 00:20:49,742
Mine means laughter.

577
00:20:51,702 --> 00:20:52,982
Let's spend our lives together.

578
00:20:53,742 --> 00:20:55,583
I'll be good to you for a lifetime.

579
00:20:55,742 --> 00:20:57,183
Okay.

580
00:20:57,383 --> 00:20:57,982
Okay.

581
00:20:59,103 --> 00:21:00,103
Listen.

582
00:21:00,183 --> 00:21:01,063
I gave back

583
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:02,742
the 3,600 yuan

584
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:04,222
he gave me.

585
00:21:06,863 --> 00:21:07,702
Aren't I awesome?

586
00:21:07,782 --> 00:21:08,583
Really?

587
00:21:12,903 --> 00:21:13,702
Awesome.

588
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:14,823
Awesome.

589
00:21:16,143 --> 00:21:17,462
Not bad.

590
00:21:18,982 --> 00:21:19,583
Then can you

591
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:21,143
also return the 600 yuan to me?

592
00:21:24,863 --> 00:21:25,662
Kaixin.

593
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,783
Kaixin, 500 is also fine.

594
00:21:26,863 --> 00:21:27,583
Kaixin.

595
00:21:27,903 --> 00:21:28,702
Kaixin.

596
00:21:29,502 --> 00:21:30,823
Kaixin. Kaixin.

597
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:52,263
(You're just)

598
00:21:52,343 --> 00:21:53,382
(a scumbag and womanizer)

599
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:54,583
(who travels with condoms.)

600
00:21:54,663 --> 00:21:55,263
(How dare you)

601
00:21:55,343 --> 00:21:56,542
(despise Xu Kaixin?)

602
00:21:56,823 --> 00:21:58,543
This is quite the magical box.

603
00:21:58,623 --> 00:21:59,982
I advise you not to open it.

604
00:22:00,062 --> 00:22:01,583
You're going to be awkward.

605
00:22:12,742 --> 00:22:14,782
(You insulted me
and wrongfully accused me.)

606
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:15,743
(I won't use)

607
00:22:15,823 --> 00:22:16,782
(your service anymore.)

608
00:22:17,462 --> 00:22:19,143
(On what grounds did you insult me?)

609
00:22:19,383 --> 00:22:20,422
(It's not at all)

610
00:22:20,502 --> 00:22:21,663
(as you imagined, okay?)

611
00:22:23,495 --> 00:22:25,752
(You're not his/her friend yet)
What?

612
00:22:28,262 --> 00:22:28,863
Wait.

613
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:35,288
(Happy Cake Shop)

614
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:41,944
(Happy Cake Shop,
2068 Xinhong Road, Bindong District)

615
00:22:55,103 --> 00:22:55,942
Li Xiaoxiao, listen.

616
00:22:56,022 --> 00:22:57,462
I'm done cleaning up your mess.

617
00:22:58,062 --> 00:22:59,622
I didn't get a single penny from this,

618
00:22:59,702 --> 00:23:01,183
and I even paid for drinks.

619
00:23:01,542 --> 00:23:02,942
I'm "happy" and you're "laughter",

620
00:23:03,022 --> 00:23:04,462
so I have to pamper you for life?

621
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,623
Pamper you, my foot!

622
00:23:06,103 --> 00:23:06,903
Wake up.

623
00:23:07,794 --> 00:23:08,375
What?

624
00:23:09,903 --> 00:23:11,343
Close your mouth. It's cold.

625
00:23:29,143 --> 00:23:32,663
A, B, C, D.

626
00:23:32,943 --> 00:23:34,062
Orange.

627
00:23:34,262 --> 00:23:34,943
Apple.

628
00:23:36,183 --> 00:23:36,903
Orange.

629
00:23:38,103 --> 00:23:38,903
Banana.

630
00:23:39,663 --> 00:23:41,222
Even I want a banana now.

631
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:51,462
Hurry up.

632
00:23:51,702 --> 00:23:52,942
Don't let him go.

633
00:23:53,022 --> 00:23:53,902
Fight him. Okay.

634
00:23:53,982 --> 00:23:54,782
Nice.

635
00:23:58,215 --> 00:23:59,480
(Dad)

636
00:24:03,982 --> 00:24:04,702
Come on.

637
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:07,262
Hello?

638
00:24:07,702 --> 00:24:09,222
May I help you?

639
00:24:09,462 --> 00:24:12,103
Youyou, can you come out?

640
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:15,023
You should teach Yu'an and Yule

641
00:24:15,103 --> 00:24:16,222
some English.

642
00:24:16,462 --> 00:24:17,783
When your mom and I say

643
00:24:17,863 --> 00:24:18,903
A, B, C, D...

644
00:24:20,222 --> 00:24:20,942
We always

645
00:24:21,022 --> 00:24:22,103
have the accent

646
00:24:22,623 --> 00:24:24,142
of the London suburbs.

647
00:24:24,222 --> 00:24:25,662
You're better at this. You do it.

648
00:24:25,742 --> 00:24:26,462
Alright?

649
00:24:26,542 --> 00:24:27,222
Do you need me

650
00:24:27,302 --> 00:24:28,222
to work overtime?

651
00:24:28,302 --> 00:24:29,503
It's off-duty time now.

652
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:30,503
If you need overtime,

653
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:31,462
you'll have to pay

654
00:24:31,542 --> 00:24:32,462
overtime pay, okay?

655
00:24:32,623 --> 00:24:33,663
Cut the nonsense.

656
00:24:33,782 --> 00:24:34,782
Get out here.

657
00:24:35,062 --> 00:24:35,823
I spent

658
00:24:35,903 --> 00:24:38,222
so much money to send you abroad.

659
00:24:38,302 --> 00:24:39,103
Is it for you

660
00:24:39,183 --> 00:24:40,142
to stay cooped up,

661
00:24:40,222 --> 00:24:41,143
playing games all day?

662
00:24:41,262 --> 00:24:42,702
It's such a tiny favor,

663
00:24:42,782 --> 00:24:44,103
and you want me to pay?

664
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,383
Are you a freeloader?

665
00:24:45,663 --> 00:24:46,663
Listen to me.

666
00:24:46,782 --> 00:24:48,062
If only your sister...

667
00:24:55,982 --> 00:24:57,742
You would rather I died
in her place, right?

668
00:25:04,022 --> 00:25:04,622
I'm fine.

669
00:25:04,702 --> 00:25:05,823
I just went to the bathroom.

670
00:25:07,383 --> 00:25:08,183
Let's go.

671
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,502
Take the middle lane.

672
00:25:13,782 --> 00:25:14,583
Hello?

673
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:16,022
Hello?

674
00:25:19,702 --> 00:25:21,702
I can't believe her.

675
00:25:25,262 --> 00:25:27,583
She stays home all day
just eating and pooping.

676
00:25:27,823 --> 00:25:29,543
Hadn't I let her pick up the kids,

677
00:25:29,623 --> 00:25:30,422
she'd have locked

678
00:25:30,502 --> 00:25:31,303
herself in the room

679
00:25:31,383 --> 00:25:33,022
without realizing she's going moldy.

680
00:25:33,302 --> 00:25:35,262
I spent so much money
raising a good-for-nothing.

681
00:25:36,062 --> 00:25:37,462
I must owe her from a past life.

682
00:25:38,823 --> 00:25:41,103
No wonder Mei Chengyi doesn't like her.

683
00:25:41,542 --> 00:25:42,343
If only she could

684
00:25:42,423 --> 00:25:43,303
be like her sister...

685
00:25:43,383 --> 00:25:43,982
Enough.

686
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:46,462
Don't talk to her

687
00:25:46,542 --> 00:25:47,502
like that anymore.

688
00:25:47,623 --> 00:25:48,743
You don't even know

689
00:25:48,823 --> 00:25:49,943
how unpleasant you sound.

690
00:25:50,903 --> 00:25:52,062
We're not short on money.

691
00:25:52,542 --> 00:25:53,823
She can stay home if she wants.

692
00:25:57,103 --> 00:25:58,943
Living well is better than anything.

693
00:26:52,782 --> 00:26:54,103
Why turned down my video call?

694
00:26:54,623 --> 00:26:55,902
I'm getting ready to sleep.

695
00:26:55,982 --> 00:26:57,462
It's dark. You couldn't see me.

696
00:26:58,502 --> 00:26:59,542
Everything's fine, right?

697
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:00,502
It's all good.

698
00:27:00,823 --> 00:27:02,182
I'm staying in my old room.

699
00:27:02,262 --> 00:27:03,182
My dad will come over

700
00:27:03,262 --> 00:27:04,023
to tuck me in.

701
00:27:04,103 --> 00:27:05,022
It's comfortable.

702
00:27:05,183 --> 00:27:06,063
Mom, don't worry.

703
00:27:06,143 --> 00:27:06,662
Tomorrow is

704
00:27:06,742 --> 00:27:08,062
the weekend. I won't sleep in.

705
00:27:08,383 --> 00:27:09,063
I won't be late

706
00:27:09,143 --> 00:27:10,222
for the English class.

707
00:27:10,903 --> 00:27:12,182
I've canceled

708
00:27:12,262 --> 00:27:13,343
the English tutoring class.

709
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,103
What?

710
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,063
And your other tutoring classes too.

711
00:27:16,143 --> 00:27:17,183
I've canceled them all.

712
00:27:18,143 --> 00:27:18,823
What do you mean?

713
00:27:18,903 --> 00:27:21,063
You stopped all my tutoring classes?

714
00:27:21,143 --> 00:27:22,623
Didn't you tell your dad that you

715
00:27:22,782 --> 00:27:23,583
hate me and Lili

716
00:27:23,663 --> 00:27:24,982
for controlling you too much?

717
00:27:25,302 --> 00:27:26,743
And we forced you to attend

718
00:27:26,823 --> 00:27:27,702
various classes.

719
00:27:28,583 --> 00:27:29,622
Starting today,

720
00:27:29,702 --> 00:27:30,743
you don't have to.

721
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:31,422
Lili and I

722
00:27:31,502 --> 00:27:32,543
won't control you anymore.

723
00:27:32,623 --> 00:27:33,343
Do whatever

724
00:27:33,423 --> 00:27:34,262
you want to do.

725
00:27:35,103 --> 00:27:36,063
Mom, you're an adult.

726
00:27:36,143 --> 00:27:37,303
Why are you so petty with me,

727
00:27:37,383 --> 00:27:38,302
a kid?

728
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,103
Who isn't a kid sometimes?

729
00:27:40,262 --> 00:27:41,063
I'm even Lili's

730
00:27:41,143 --> 00:27:42,103
little baby.

731
00:27:42,222 --> 00:27:43,182
Alright, that's it.

732
00:27:43,262 --> 00:27:44,063
Get to bed early.

733
00:27:44,143 --> 00:27:44,903
Good night.

734
00:27:54,982 --> 00:27:56,062
Dad.

735
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,062
Dad.

736
00:27:58,062 --> 00:27:59,103
Dad.

737
00:27:59,462 --> 00:28:00,222
Dad.

738
00:28:00,702 --> 00:28:01,382
Alright.

739
00:28:01,462 --> 00:28:02,382
I really have to go.

740
00:28:02,462 --> 00:28:03,222
I do.

741
00:28:05,702 --> 00:28:06,583
Be good.

742
00:28:06,903 --> 00:28:08,502
As long as I get the kids settled

743
00:28:08,742 --> 00:28:10,222
and get the custody,

744
00:28:10,302 --> 00:28:11,982
my mom won't make it hard for you.

745
00:28:12,062 --> 00:28:14,462
Then you can be a mom
without any hassle, right?

746
00:28:14,583 --> 00:28:15,543
You can keep slim.

747
00:28:15,623 --> 00:28:16,543
You'll still be

748
00:28:16,623 --> 00:28:17,623
our little princess.

749
00:28:19,103 --> 00:28:20,062
Alright.

750
00:28:20,863 --> 00:28:21,623
Be good.

751
00:28:24,423 --> 00:28:25,783
Honey, don't worry.

752
00:28:25,863 --> 00:28:27,343
I'll treat them well.

753
00:28:41,782 --> 00:28:42,303
Dad, Mom,

754
00:28:42,383 --> 00:28:43,422
I'm leaving first.

755
00:28:43,502 --> 00:28:44,263
Have a good rest.

756
00:28:44,343 --> 00:28:45,182
- Okay.
- Say goodbye.

757
00:28:45,262 --> 00:28:45,863
- Okay.
- Okay.

758
00:28:45,943 --> 00:28:46,902
Goodbye.

759
00:28:46,982 --> 00:28:48,462
Goodbye, sweethearts.

760
00:28:48,542 --> 00:28:49,383
Be good.

761
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:51,062
Chengyi,

762
00:28:53,702 --> 00:28:55,742
since you have a girlfriend,

763
00:28:56,262 --> 00:28:58,062
bring her over to let us see her.

764
00:28:58,863 --> 00:28:59,662
After all,

765
00:28:59,742 --> 00:29:00,662
she will also be

766
00:29:00,742 --> 00:29:02,462
Yu'an and Yule's stepmother
in the future.

767
00:29:02,982 --> 00:29:04,782
We have to keep an eye out for You Xin.

768
00:29:05,623 --> 00:29:06,423
Don't you agree?

769
00:29:07,742 --> 00:29:09,062
Yes, you're right.

770
00:29:09,423 --> 00:29:10,423
Don't worry, Dad.

771
00:29:11,062 --> 00:29:12,063
As long as I

772
00:29:12,143 --> 00:29:13,182
don't get your approval,

773
00:29:13,262 --> 00:29:14,143
I won't date anyone.

774
00:29:15,782 --> 00:29:16,462
Alright.

775
00:29:16,542 --> 00:29:17,142
Dad, I'm off.

776
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,103
- Okay.
- Okay.

777
00:29:18,262 --> 00:29:19,622
Press the elevator button.

778
00:29:19,702 --> 00:29:20,462
- Okay.
- Alright. Bye-bye.

779
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:21,304
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

780
00:29:21,304 --> 00:29:21,863
Okay.

781
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,222
Go to sleep quickly.

782
00:30:12,302 --> 00:30:13,622
I'm here with you.

783
00:30:13,702 --> 00:30:15,622
Dad, you've worked hard all day.

784
00:30:15,702 --> 00:30:16,623
You must be very tired.

785
00:30:17,062 --> 00:30:19,103
I'll pat you and help you sleep.

786
00:30:24,583 --> 00:30:25,542
Dami,

787
00:30:26,423 --> 00:30:27,063
just stay here

788
00:30:27,143 --> 00:30:28,583
for a while longer.

789
00:30:29,502 --> 00:30:30,823
Tell Ms. Xiaojiao

790
00:30:31,423 --> 00:30:33,383
that you want me
to sleep with you every day.

791
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:34,382
Okay.

792
00:30:34,462 --> 00:30:36,823
I love it when you're with me.

793
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,423
I also want to be with you.

794
00:30:46,383 --> 00:30:48,143
This is the most peaceful time

795
00:30:48,663 --> 00:30:50,302
of the day.

796
00:31:32,022 --> 00:31:33,502
(Stranger)
(Beauty, want to hang out?)

797
00:31:33,863 --> 00:31:34,782
(I'm 1.8 and 18.)

798
00:31:34,982 --> 00:31:35,743
(Looking for)

799
00:31:35,823 --> 00:31:37,183
(a 30-year-old lady.)

800
00:31:37,383 --> 00:31:38,343
(My place is big.)

801
00:31:38,502 --> 00:31:39,462
(My wife is not home.)

802
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:13,135
♪Everyone has been young♪

803
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,720
♪Those memories mottled♪

804

809
00:32:52,742 --> 00:32:54,502
Good morning, Ms. Xiaoxiao.

810
00:32:55,583 --> 00:32:59,663
Good morning, Xiaomi.

811
00:33:01,423 --> 00:33:03,183
Xiaoxiao, you're up.

812
00:33:03,742 --> 00:33:04,982
Won't you get some more sleep?

813
00:33:05,062 --> 00:33:05,982
Lili,

814
00:33:06,062 --> 00:33:07,903
why am I at your place?

815
00:33:08,462 --> 00:33:10,502
Kaixin said you were drunk yesterday.

816
00:33:10,702 --> 00:33:11,422
She'd be worried

817
00:33:11,502 --> 00:33:13,583
if you were alone at home.

818
00:33:14,222 --> 00:33:15,423
Love you all.

819
00:33:15,982 --> 00:33:16,782
Where is Kaixin?

820
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:18,783
She got up at four.

821
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:21,222
Look, she's prepared these cakes.

822
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:23,542
Orders pile up on weekends.

823
00:33:24,742 --> 00:33:25,623
So many?

824
00:33:31,502 --> 00:33:32,302
Xu Kaixin.

825
00:33:32,982 --> 00:33:34,262
You didn't remove my makeup.

826
00:33:34,462 --> 00:33:35,542
I'm sure to get pimples.

827
00:33:35,742 --> 00:33:36,542
Serves you right.

828
00:33:37,022 --> 00:33:37,942
Last night,

829
00:33:38,022 --> 00:33:38,622
you ground

830
00:33:38,702 --> 00:33:40,103
your teeth like a big monster.

831
00:33:40,183 --> 00:33:40,942
You know what?

832
00:33:41,022 --> 00:33:41,823
You made me dream

833
00:33:41,903 --> 00:33:43,702
of being eaten by a tiger.

834
00:33:45,903 --> 00:33:46,823
How about this?

835
00:33:46,903 --> 00:33:48,103
Let me take you

836
00:33:48,183 --> 00:33:49,262
to a beauty salon.

837
00:33:49,542 --> 00:33:50,502
I'll pay.

838
00:33:50,663 --> 00:33:51,903
Today is Sunday.

839
00:33:52,022 --> 00:33:53,823
It's my prime time to earn money.

840
00:33:53,903 --> 00:33:55,303
Don't canceled up my serious work.

841
00:33:55,383 --> 00:33:56,382
Just go, Kaixin.

842
00:33:56,462 --> 00:33:57,782
You should relax.

843
00:33:58,022 --> 00:33:59,343
Finish all the cakes

844
00:33:59,423 --> 00:34:00,302
in the morning.

845
00:34:00,383 --> 00:34:01,743
Xiaomi and I'll watch the shop.

846
00:34:01,823 --> 00:34:02,622
Alright?

847
00:34:02,702 --> 00:34:04,502
Exactly, let's go.

848
00:34:04,742 --> 00:34:07,583
Let's go.

849
00:34:07,663 --> 00:34:09,223
Stop with the baby voice.

850
00:34:09,303 --> 00:34:10,622
You sound like a duck.

851
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:11,902
Last night,

852
00:34:11,982 --> 00:34:12,942
you cost me over 200.

853
00:34:13,022 --> 00:34:14,263
Today I'll have a full upgrade,

854
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:14,982
head to toe.

855
00:34:15,062 --> 00:34:16,022
And it's on you.

856
00:34:16,102 --> 00:34:16,863
No problem.

857
00:34:21,743 --> 00:34:22,542
Dami,

858
00:34:22,743 --> 00:34:23,942
look. I've prepared you

859
00:34:24,022 --> 00:34:26,622
a feast version of breakfast.

860
00:34:26,743 --> 00:34:28,102
See what you like to eat.

861
00:34:28,383 --> 00:34:30,582
There are buns, corns, and pancakes.

862
00:34:31,022 --> 00:34:32,743
Oil sticks, burgers, and pancake wraps.

863
00:34:32,823 --> 00:34:34,542
Ms. Xiaojiao, you're so nice.

864
00:34:34,622 --> 00:34:35,143
At home,

865
00:34:35,223 --> 00:34:36,982
my mom doesn't allow me to eat takeout.

866
00:34:38,703 --> 00:34:39,903
It's so bountiful.

867
00:34:40,783 --> 00:34:41,783
Ms. Xiaojiao

868
00:34:41,863 --> 00:34:42,823
is so nice to you.

869
00:34:43,383 --> 00:34:44,303
Thank you.

870
00:34:44,502 --> 00:34:45,303
Hurry up and eat.

871
00:34:45,542 --> 00:34:48,183
Here, eat a bun.

872
00:34:48,263 --> 00:34:48,823
Dad,

873
00:34:48,903 --> 00:34:50,263
my mom canceled

874
00:34:50,343 --> 00:34:50,902
my classes.

875
00:34:50,982 --> 00:34:52,622
She said she won't pay for them anymore.

876
00:34:53,982 --> 00:34:55,383
Why? Is she crazy?

877
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:57,102
It's all right.

878
00:34:57,462 --> 00:34:58,982
If your mom won't pay, I will.

879
00:34:59,622 --> 00:35:00,982
I love you the most.

880
00:35:01,462 --> 00:35:02,263
How much?

881
00:35:02,703 --> 00:35:04,622
15,000 a year for English class.

882
00:35:05,062 --> 00:35:06,423
12,000 for math.

883
00:35:07,102 --> 00:35:08,662
8,800 for dance class.

884
00:35:08,823 --> 00:35:10,022
13,000 for building blocks.

885
00:35:10,182 --> 00:35:10,942
By the way,

886
00:35:11,022 --> 00:35:12,902
piano class is paid quarterly.

887
00:35:12,982 --> 00:35:13,623
It's 6,800.

888
00:35:13,703 --> 00:35:14,582
If we don't pay today,

889
00:35:14,662 --> 00:35:15,863
I'll have to stop the classes.

890
00:35:19,022 --> 00:35:20,502
How much is the total?

891
00:35:20,582 --> 00:35:21,783
55,600.

892
00:35:22,542 --> 00:35:24,022
Isn't that a bit expensive?

893
00:35:25,182 --> 00:35:25,942
But my mom

894
00:35:26,022 --> 00:35:27,303
kept enrolling me in classes.

895
00:35:27,383 --> 00:35:28,703
She didn't find it expensive.

896
00:35:29,863 --> 00:35:31,142
I also don't find it expensive.

897
00:35:31,303 --> 00:35:32,703
It's for you and Xiaomi's classes.

898
00:35:32,783 --> 00:35:33,343
Right?

899
00:35:34,062 --> 00:35:35,263
We can't skimp on education

900
00:35:35,662 --> 00:35:37,102
or make it tough for the kids.

901
00:35:38,182 --> 00:35:38,743
Later,

902
00:35:38,823 --> 00:35:39,902
I'll give you a card

903
00:35:39,982 --> 00:35:40,942
with 60,000 on it.

904
00:35:41,022 --> 00:35:41,743
Okay?

905
00:35:42,383 --> 00:35:43,582
After you pay off

906
00:35:43,662 --> 00:35:44,823
all the class fees,

907
00:35:44,903 --> 00:35:46,062
you two can buy things

908
00:35:46,182 --> 00:35:47,022
with the rest.

909
00:35:47,102 --> 00:35:47,823
Okay?

910
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,743
Okay, thank you, Dad.

911
00:35:50,102 --> 00:35:50,663
Alright.

912
00:35:50,743 --> 00:35:51,622
Let's eat.

913
00:35:52,102 --> 00:35:53,783
My stomach feels a bit uncomfortable.

914
00:35:54,343 --> 00:35:54,982
Dami,

915
00:35:55,062 --> 00:35:56,462
eat well yourself.

916
00:35:56,542 --> 00:35:57,902
I will go in and rest for a while.

917
00:35:57,982 --> 00:35:58,582
Okay.

918
00:35:58,662 --> 00:35:59,743
I'll go lie down for a bit.

919
00:36:09,582 --> 00:36:10,102
Dad,

920
00:36:10,182 --> 00:36:10,783
is Ms. Xiaojiao

921
00:36:10,863 --> 00:36:12,422
feeling upset?

922
00:36:12,502 --> 00:36:13,303
No.

923
00:36:13,982 --> 00:36:14,663
It's her stomach.

924
00:36:14,743 --> 00:36:15,542
A stomach bug.

925
00:36:19,303 --> 00:36:19,982
Hurry and eat.

926
00:36:20,062 --> 00:36:20,982
Once you're done,

927
00:36:21,062 --> 00:36:22,102
get changed.

928
00:36:22,182 --> 00:36:23,823
Today I will take you shopping.

929
00:36:23,903 --> 00:36:24,703
Okay.

930
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:25,462
Thank you, Dad.

931
00:36:25,542 --> 00:36:26,183
Eat quickly.

932
00:36:26,263 --> 00:36:27,343
I'll go check on Xiaojiao

933
00:36:27,502 --> 00:36:28,622
to see how she is doing.

934
00:36:39,263 --> 00:36:40,062
Hu Xiaojiao,

935
00:36:41,182 --> 00:36:42,062
didn't we agree

936
00:36:42,142 --> 00:36:43,343
to spend time with my kids?

937
00:36:43,423 --> 00:36:43,942
What's with

938
00:36:44,022 --> 00:36:45,382
the princess act?

939
00:36:45,462 --> 00:36:46,062
You are upset

940
00:36:46,142 --> 00:36:46,743
all day long.

941
00:36:46,823 --> 00:36:48,142
Are you ever done?

942
00:36:48,223 --> 00:36:49,343
If you push me to the limit,

943
00:36:49,423 --> 00:36:50,263
see what happens.

944
00:36:50,343 --> 00:36:51,622
You won't even have a way out.

945
00:36:52,062 --> 00:36:53,022
It's 60,000 yuan.

946
00:36:53,102 --> 00:36:54,102
Did you talk to me?

947
00:36:54,182 --> 00:36:55,382
You just decided to give it.

948
00:36:55,462 --> 00:36:56,982
It's enough to buy a Chanel bag.

949
00:36:57,462 --> 00:36:59,223
Yes, but didn't you hear it too?

950
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:01,303
Xu Kaixin has been paying the money
for years.

951
00:37:01,383 --> 00:37:02,582
We have never paid

952
00:37:02,662 --> 00:37:03,582
child support.

953
00:37:03,662 --> 00:37:05,703
60,000 isn't much.

954
00:37:05,903 --> 00:37:07,223
Yeah, we haven't paid.

955
00:37:07,982 --> 00:37:08,863
But it's expensive.

956
00:37:13,502 --> 00:37:14,303
Hu Xiaojiao,

957
00:37:15,502 --> 00:37:16,623
when we were first together,

958
00:37:16,703 --> 00:37:18,143
you didn't want to be a stepmom.

959
00:37:18,223 --> 00:37:19,542
So I gave up custody of the kids

960
00:37:19,622 --> 00:37:20,903
to be with you.

961
00:37:21,383 --> 00:37:21,982
Can't you tell

962
00:37:22,062 --> 00:37:23,502
what's more important now?

963
00:37:23,662 --> 00:37:25,022
My mom is sick now.

964
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:26,383
She's very sick.

965
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:27,303
Her only wish

966
00:37:27,383 --> 00:37:28,462
is to have a grandchild.

967
00:37:28,622 --> 00:37:29,743
But that's not my problem...

968
00:37:29,823 --> 00:37:31,743
Although I am not a good person,

969
00:37:31,823 --> 00:37:33,102
I am certainly my mother's

970
00:37:33,182 --> 00:37:33,743
good son.

971
00:37:33,823 --> 00:37:35,623
I must help her fulfill this wish.

972
00:37:35,703 --> 00:37:37,703
I'm falling way behind now.

973
00:37:37,783 --> 00:37:39,542
I haven't even gotten to see Xiaomi.

974
00:37:39,622 --> 00:37:40,223
So today

975
00:37:40,303 --> 00:37:41,102
I must get along

976
00:37:41,182 --> 00:37:42,462
with Dami well

977
00:37:42,542 --> 00:37:44,223
to try to win over the two kids.

978
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:44,902
On this matter,

979
00:37:44,982 --> 00:37:46,623
if you can cooperate, then do so.

980
00:37:46,703 --> 00:37:48,423
If not, we should divorce early.

981
00:37:49,383 --> 00:37:51,423
Listen, although I love you very much,

982
00:37:53,783 --> 00:37:54,663
I will never

983
00:37:54,743 --> 00:37:56,743
stop you from pursuing your happiness.

984
00:37:58,662 --> 00:37:59,542
I can keep the pain

985
00:37:59,622 --> 00:38:00,542
to myself.

986
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:07,863
Honey,

987
00:38:08,542 --> 00:38:10,102
don't leave me.

988
00:38:10,182 --> 00:38:11,542
I don't want a divorce.

989
00:38:13,423 --> 00:38:15,703
Give them money if you want to, okay?

990
00:38:15,783 --> 00:38:16,942
Don't leave me.

991
00:38:17,022 --> 00:38:18,102
I don't want a divorce.

992
00:38:18,182 --> 00:38:19,622
I don't want a divorce.

993
00:38:20,502 --> 00:38:21,462
Okay?

994
00:38:26,582 --> 00:38:27,303
Alright.

995
00:38:27,662 --> 00:38:29,502
Alright, no divorce.

996
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:33,462
Go change your clothes.

997
00:38:33,662 --> 00:38:34,303
I will take you

998
00:38:34,383 --> 00:38:35,462
to go shopping for clothes.

999
00:38:37,142 --> 00:38:38,383
That's more like it.

1000
00:38:40,502 --> 00:38:41,582
Just go.

1001
00:38:42,783 --> 00:38:43,416

that store is fun.

Xiaomi.

1035
00:40:29,662 --> 00:40:30,663
Let's start eating.

1036
00:40:30,743 --> 00:40:32,462
I'm exhausted. I must have been silly.

1039
00:40:35,982 --> 00:40:36,622
Oh my gosh.

1040
00:40:37,903 --> 00:40:39,062
Can we leave now?

1041
00:40:39,142 --> 00:40:40,423
Let's go.

1042
00:40:40,542 --> 00:40:41,902
Xiaomi,

1043
00:40:41,982 --> 00:40:43,382
be good and listen to Lili.

We are off to primp.

1046
00:40:45,903 --> 00:40:46,703
Okay, just go.

1047
00:40:46,783 --> 00:40:47,542

Look at you.

1054
00:41:01,423 --> 00:41:02,462
I overcharged earlier.

1055
00:41:02,542 --> 00:41:03,343
Now I'm paranoid

1056
00:41:03,423 --> 00:41:04,382
they'll vanish.

1057
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,462
Isn't spending easy?

1058
00:41:05,542 --> 00:41:06,542
I'll come weekly later.

1059
00:41:06,622 --> 00:41:07,382
It's on you anyway.

1060
00:41:07,462 --> 00:41:08,223

1061

1062
00:41:13,542 --> 00:41:14,343
Look.

1063
00:41:16,142 --> 00:41:17,263
Do you want milk tea?

1064
00:41:17,343 --> 00:41:18,102
No.

1065
00:41:26,423 --> 00:41:27,303
Aren't they

1066
00:41:27,863 --> 00:41:28,703
Qian Hao, that woman,

1067
00:41:28,783 --> 00:41:29,863
and Dami?

1068
00:41:33,863 --> 00:41:35,743
Dad, I want that massager.

1069
00:41:37,582 --> 00:41:38,462
At your young age,

1070
00:41:38,542 --> 00:41:39,582
why do you need that?

1071
00:41:39,662 --> 00:41:41,263
I usually bow my head to do homework.

1072
00:41:41,343 --> 00:41:42,263
My neck gets sore.

1073
00:41:42,343 --> 00:41:43,823
And I need to carry a schoolbag.

1074
00:41:43,982 --> 00:41:45,542
My mom usually massages me.

1075
00:41:46,022 --> 00:41:47,663
If you really don't want to...

1076
00:41:47,743 --> 00:41:48,383
I'll buy it.

1077
00:41:48,743 --> 00:41:49,663
It costs only hundreds.

1078
00:41:49,743 --> 00:41:50,902
I can afford it.

1079
00:41:50,982 --> 00:41:51,783
Let's buy it, honey.

1080
00:41:51,863 --> 00:41:52,783
It's unnecessary.

1081
00:41:53,343 --> 00:41:54,542
Thank you, Ms. Xiaojiao.

1082
00:41:54,703 --> 00:41:55,502
Okay.

1083
00:41:56,863 --> 00:41:57,942
I'll pay.

1084
00:41:58,022 --> 00:41:58,623
I'll pay.

Ms. Xiaoxiao,

1090
00:42:06,582 --> 00:42:07,783
don't bully her like this.

1091
00:42:08,223 --> 00:42:08,942
Qian Dami,

1092
00:42:09,022 --> 00:42:10,062
do you know who she is?

1093
00:42:10,142 --> 00:42:11,303
She is my dad's new wife.

1094
00:42:11,383 --> 00:42:12,462
You can't bully her.

1095
00:42:15,582 --> 00:42:16,343

Qian Dami.

1099
00:42:20,888 --> 00:42:22,263
- Let's go.
- Qian Dami, I didn't

1100
00:42:22,343 --> 00:42:23,542
expect you to be a traitor.

1101
00:42:23,622 --> 00:42:24,943
We wasted our love on you.

1102
00:42:29,863 --> 00:42:31,462
I will pay the bill for you now.

1103
00:42:31,542 --> 00:42:32,182
Okay.

1104
00:42:35,343 --> 00:42:36,582

1105
00:42:37,303 --> 00:42:38,102

1106
00:42:40,303 --> 00:42:41,383
Easy.

1107
00:42:43,462 --> 00:42:44,542
I'm so mad.

1108
00:42:45,542 --> 00:42:46,542
You gave birth

1109
00:42:46,622 --> 00:42:47,183
to them both.

1110
00:42:47,263 --> 00:42:49,182

1111
00:42:49,502 --> 00:42:50,623
I'll only buy Xiaomi things.

1112
00:42:50,703 --> 00:42:52,062
Nothing for Qian Dami anymore.

1113
00:42:52,863 --> 00:42:54,462
I want to return those things.

1114
00:42:54,582 --> 00:42:55,383
Return them.

1115
00:42:59,223 --> 00:43:00,223
Don't be mad.

1116
00:43:00,943 --> 00:43:01,663
It's all my fault.

1117
00:43:01,743 --> 00:43:03,142
I should've played blind.

1118
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:04,783
