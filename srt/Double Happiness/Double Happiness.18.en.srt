I'll send them

back.

So fast. Time flies.

A whole day just passed by in a blink.

21
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,753
Talk to Xu Kaixin.

22
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:57,232
Let Xiaomi

23
00:01:57,232 --> 00:01:58,913
stay with me for a few more days.

24
00:01:59,593 --> 00:02:00,792
Staying with Grandma

25
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:02,712
is only natural, isn't it?

26
00:02:03,352 --> 00:02:04,352
I'll ask.

27
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:21,473
She said no.

28
00:02:22,033 --> 00:02:23,352
Why not?

29
00:02:23,552 --> 00:02:25,112
On what grounds?

30
00:02:25,352 --> 00:02:27,593
Why can't he stay with Grandma?

31
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,873
Xu Kaixin is too domineering.

32
00:02:29,873 --> 00:02:31,112
I can't believe it.

33
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:31,673
Xiaomi,

34
00:02:31,673 --> 00:02:33,313
you just stay with me.

35
00:02:33,313 --> 00:02:35,313
Let's see who can take you away.

36
00:02:35,313 --> 00:02:36,313
Xiaomi.

37
00:02:40,232 --> 00:02:41,512
I want to go home.

38
00:02:41,713 --> 00:02:42,832
Oh, my!

39
00:02:42,832 --> 00:02:45,552
I want to go home.
I'm not playing anymore.

40
00:02:45,552 --> 00:02:46,593
Oh, my!

41
00:02:46,593 --> 00:02:47,792
I want to go home.

42
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:48,274
Okay.

43
00:02:48,274 --> 00:02:49,552
I want Mom.

44
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:50,552
Come on. Get up.

45
00:02:51,593 --> 00:02:52,353
I want Mom.

46
00:02:52,353 --> 00:02:53,913
Alright, stop fussing.

47
00:02:54,193 --> 00:02:54,953
Did you forget

48
00:02:54,953 --> 00:02:56,313
what I told you?

49
00:02:58,232 --> 00:03:00,033
Okay, don't fuss.

50
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,313
Xiaomi, eat.

51
00:03:11,473 --> 00:03:12,473
This guy.

52
00:03:16,952 --> 00:03:18,112
Xiaomi, that's enough.

53
00:03:18,112 --> 00:03:18,754
After eating,

54
00:03:18,754 --> 00:03:20,232
let Dad take you back.

55
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:39,913
Slow down.

56
00:03:39,913 --> 00:03:40,713
What's wrong?

57
00:03:40,713 --> 00:03:41,713
Believe...

58
00:03:42,273 --> 00:03:43,473
Ms. Lili.

59
00:03:43,873 --> 00:03:45,313
She was in a bad mood and drank.

60
00:03:45,313 --> 00:03:46,713
Lest her parents would punish her,

61
00:03:46,713 --> 00:03:47,873
she'll stay here for a night.

62
00:03:48,433 --> 00:03:49,816
Who said I'm in a bad mood?

63
00:03:49,816 --> 00:03:50,274
I'm good.

64
00:03:50,274 --> 00:03:51,433
Don't act crazy.

65
00:03:51,433 --> 00:03:51,993
No.

66
00:03:51,993 --> 00:03:52,344
Alright.

67
00:03:52,344 --> 00:03:53,593
I'm in a good mood.

68
00:03:53,593 --> 00:03:54,314
A young girl,

69
00:03:54,314 --> 00:03:56,033
how can you drink like this?

70
00:03:56,033 --> 00:03:56,633
I'll go get you

71
00:03:56,633 --> 00:03:57,880
some sobering soup to drink.

72
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,274
Okay.

73
00:03:58,274 --> 00:03:59,672
Don't leave, Lili, come on.

74
00:04:00,552 --> 00:04:01,233
Give a kiss.

75
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:02,713
The saliva smells like alcohol.

76
00:04:02,713 --> 00:04:03,633
Alright, alright.

77
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:04,913
Sit properly.

78
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:07,713
- Lili, I really love you.
- Really. Alright.

79
00:04:07,713 --> 00:04:08,713
Lili.

80
00:04:09,193 --> 00:04:10,113
Alright, alright.

81
00:04:10,113 --> 00:04:12,232
I want to add more vinegar.

82
00:04:12,232 --> 00:04:13,913

96
00:04:47,672 --> 00:04:49,153
Look at how I fold it.

97
00:04:51,752 --> 00:04:52,792
After folding it,

98
00:04:54,153 --> 00:04:55,513

101
00:05:00,393 --> 00:05:01,913
put it where it should be.

102
00:05:01,913 --> 00:05:03,312
Also, put the book you will use

103
00:05:03,312 --> 00:05:04,513

104
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:05,432

114
00:06:10,432 --> 00:06:11,432
Yes.

116
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:17,473
I know where you are.

00:06:18,112 --> 00:06:19,112
I...

118
00:06:21,352 --> 00:06:22,752
Mom, eat some fruit.

119
00:06:22,752 --> 00:06:23,074
Okay.

120
00:06:23,074 --> 00:06:24,593
I'll help Qian Hao washing dishes.

121
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:27,473
You're pregnant. Sit down.

122
00:06:27,473 --> 00:06:28,792
I'll go.

123
00:06:29,273 --> 00:06:30,273
Thank you.

124
00:06:31,033 --> 00:06:32,393
Come over.

Qian Hao, come on.

126
00:06:34,192 --> 00:06:35,232
I will wash.

127
00:06:35,232 --> 00:06:35,913
I'll do it.

128
00:06:35,913 --> 00:06:36,153
You...

129
00:06:36,153 --> 00:06:37,073
You go rest.

130
00:06:37,073 --> 00:06:38,073
It's okay.

131
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,033
You can't do it.

132
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:39,793
I'm quite grown up.

133
00:06:39,793 --> 00:06:40,833
Of course I can do it.

134
00:06:41,073 --> 00:06:42,273
My god.

135
00:06:43,393 --> 00:06:44,672
In the future,

136
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:46,432
ask Hu Xiaojiao to do these.

137
00:06:47,112 --> 00:06:48,713
Let her flaunt for ten months.

138
00:06:48,913 --> 00:06:50,393
After that, she has to do it all.

139
00:06:52,352 --> 00:06:54,713
But you're quite capable.

140
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:55,514
You got her

141
00:06:55,514 --> 00:06:56,913
under control.

142
00:06:57,073 --> 00:06:58,752
She doesn't ask about it anymore, right?

143
00:06:59,273 --> 00:07:00,633
Don't worry about this anymore.

144
00:07:00,713 --> 00:07:02,352
Isn't it enough that she's obedient now?

145
00:07:03,232 --> 00:07:04,352
That is true.

146
00:07:07,713 --> 00:07:09,192
Dami

147
00:07:09,552 --> 00:07:10,752
is amazing.

148
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:11,992
She got Xiaomi

149
00:07:11,992 --> 00:07:13,713
well under control.

150
00:07:13,713 --> 00:07:14,752
How is that possible?

151
00:07:16,713 --> 00:07:18,352
Be a bit nicer to Dami.

152
00:07:19,232 --> 00:07:20,073
I know.

153
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:21,073
I'm not dumb.

154
00:07:22,273 --> 00:07:23,913
If we want to be good to Xiaomi,

155
00:07:24,273 --> 00:07:26,153
we have to be nicer to that girl.

156
00:07:26,153 --> 00:07:27,153
Right?

157
00:07:29,593 --> 00:07:30,593
I'm coming.

158
00:07:33,312 --> 00:07:34,352
- Hello.
- Hello.

159
00:07:34,352 --> 00:07:35,352
Here for photos?

160
00:07:35,352 --> 00:07:36,073
Yes, I am.

161
00:07:36,073 --> 00:07:37,033
Alright, please come in.

162
00:07:37,033 --> 00:07:38,033
Hello.

163
00:07:38,953 --> 00:07:39,834
Hello, Ma'am.

164
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:40,913
Here for the photo shoot.

165
00:07:41,312 --> 00:07:43,000
Are you taking a family photo?

166
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,192
- Yes.
- Yes.

167
00:07:45,552 --> 00:07:47,033
But for taking pictures,

168
00:07:47,232 --> 00:07:48,432
I need to do makeup, right?

169
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:49,153
My complexion...

170
00:07:49,153 --> 00:07:49,833
It's fine.

171
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:50,594
We can later

172
00:07:50,594 --> 00:07:51,833
adjust this for you.

173
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,513
No, this requires some care.

174
00:07:53,593 --> 00:07:54,233
Come on.

175
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:55,320
Mom, I have cosmetics.

176
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,713
- I'll do it for you.
- Okay.

177
00:07:58,792 --> 00:07:59,593
Lipstick.

178
00:07:59,593 --> 00:08:00,232
Use this.

179
00:08:00,232 --> 00:08:00,593
Alright.

180
00:08:00,593 --> 00:08:01,352
This is fine.

181
00:08:01,352 --> 00:08:02,352
Alright.

182
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:11,792
More on the top.

183
00:08:13,552 --> 00:08:14,552
Okay, underneath.

184
00:08:16,833 --> 00:08:17,833
- Take a look.
- Okay.

185
00:08:18,752 --> 00:08:19,473
Pretty nice.

186
00:08:19,473 --> 00:08:20,473
You look good.

187
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,273
Honey, how is it?

188
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:23,833
You look good.

189
00:08:24,232 --> 00:08:25,992
Today you finally said nice words.

190
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,273
Alright.

191
00:08:28,513 --> 00:08:29,274
Let's go.

192
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:30,752
Okay, let's start.

193
00:08:30,752 --> 00:08:31,352
Alright.

194
00:08:31,352 --> 00:08:32,073
Where do we do it?

195
00:08:32,073 --> 00:08:33,312
Let's take it here on the sofa.

196
00:08:33,312 --> 00:08:34,072
Come on. You

197
00:08:34,072 --> 00:08:35,072
sit on the sofa.

198
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:35,593
Come.

199
00:08:35,593 --> 00:08:37,033
- Xiaomi.
- Right, two elders

200
00:08:37,033 --> 00:08:38,432
each hold a child.

201
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:39,633
Each person hold one child.

202
00:08:39,633 --> 00:08:40,432
Very good.

203
00:08:40,432 --> 00:08:40,824
Right.

204
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:42,273
You couple can just sit beside them.

205
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:43,034
Alright. Please

206
00:08:43,034 --> 00:08:44,393
look towards my camera this way.

207
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,034
Please

208
00:08:46,034 --> 00:08:48,273
move your heads a bit closer.

209
00:08:48,273 --> 00:08:48,553
Okay?

210
00:08:48,553 --> 00:08:49,792
Close. Snug a bit.

211
00:08:49,792 --> 00:08:50,952
Yes, a bit closer.

212
00:08:50,952 --> 00:08:52,033
Give me a very sweet

213
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,153
and happy feeling.

214
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,192
Yes, very good.

215
00:08:54,192 --> 00:08:54,633
Hold it.

216
00:08:54,633 --> 00:08:55,114
Come.

217
00:08:55,114 --> 00:08:57,832
Three, two, one, cheese.

218
00:08:58,273 --> 00:08:59,592
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

219
00:09:24,432 --> 00:09:26,952
- Dad, what are you doing?
- Dad, what are you doing?

220
00:09:31,273 --> 00:09:34,153
I'm moving around.

221
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:35,273
I feel back pain.

222
00:09:36,832 --> 00:09:37,832
Back pain.

223
00:09:38,753 --> 00:09:40,432
My back hurts again.

224
00:09:42,233 --> 00:09:44,233
Go wash up and brush your teeth.

225
00:09:44,712 --> 00:09:45,712
Going to sleep soon.

226
00:09:51,192 --> 00:09:52,233
Go.

227
00:09:52,233 --> 00:09:53,353
Hurry up.

228
00:09:57,113 --> 00:09:58,712
Mom, Dad, don't see us off.

229
00:09:58,993 --> 00:10:00,312
The hallway is dark. Don't fall.

230
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:02,552
Xiaomi,

231
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:04,233
let me see you again.

232
00:10:04,993 --> 00:10:07,393
My sweetheart.

233
00:10:09,592 --> 00:10:11,233
Make sure to visit me often.

234
00:10:11,233 --> 00:10:13,312
I don't want to be away
from you for a moment.

235
00:10:13,672 --> 00:10:14,672
Good Grandma.

236
00:10:14,753 --> 00:10:15,753
Don't be sad.

237
00:10:15,873 --> 00:10:17,832
I will come again to keep you company.

238
00:10:18,113 --> 00:10:19,672
Good.

239
00:10:19,672 --> 00:10:20,712
Come often.

240
00:10:20,832 --> 00:10:21,832
Come frequently.

241
00:10:21,832 --> 00:10:22,832
Come often.

242
00:10:23,192 --> 00:10:24,192
Go.

243
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:25,832
Let's go.

244
00:10:25,913 --> 00:10:26,593
By the way,

245
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,153
when you are in the car,

246
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:29,552
don't move around.

247
00:10:30,113 --> 00:10:32,153
Don't touch her belly.

248
00:10:32,312 --> 00:10:33,193
Inside her belly,

249
00:10:33,193 --> 00:10:34,873
there is also a little brother.

250
00:10:34,873 --> 00:10:35,873
Mom.

251
00:10:36,153 --> 00:10:37,672
I'll go get the car.

252
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,072
- Okay, it's done.
- Let's go.

253
00:10:41,072 --> 00:10:42,113
Yes, there's more.

254
00:10:42,233 --> 00:10:43,233
Quick.

255
00:10:43,792 --> 00:10:44,472
Come on.

256
00:10:44,552 --> 00:10:46,633
Here's the money, Dami, take it.

257
00:10:46,873 --> 00:10:47,713
I give you.

258
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:49,153
Buy snacks with it.

259
00:10:49,153 --> 00:10:50,273
Come on.

260
00:10:50,432 --> 00:10:51,753
Just take it.

261
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:53,192
Thank you, Grandma.

262
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:53,754
Okay.

263
00:10:53,754 --> 00:10:54,873
Buy more.

264
00:10:55,153 --> 00:10:56,153
Okay.

265
00:11:02,952 --> 00:11:04,273
Goodbye, Grandpa, Grandma.

266
00:11:04,273 --> 00:11:05,193
Goodbye.

267
00:11:05,193 --> 00:11:06,672
Be careful going downstairs.

268
00:11:06,672 --> 00:11:07,472
Go back.

269
00:11:07,472 --> 00:11:08,192
Be careful.

270
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:08,993
Watch your step.

271
00:11:08,993 --> 00:11:09,472
Let's go.

272
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:10,233
Bye-bye.

273
00:11:10,472 --> 00:11:11,472
You all go back.

274
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:12,633
Goodbye.

275
00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:13,952
Take care.

276
00:11:13,952 --> 00:11:14,633
Be careful.

277
00:11:14,633 --> 00:11:15,633
Alright.

278
00:11:17,312 --> 00:11:18,233
By the way!

279
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:19,233
Dami,

280
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:20,993
when you buy food,

281
00:11:20,993 --> 00:11:22,672
make sure to feed Xiaomi.

282
00:11:22,913 --> 00:11:24,192
You can't eat too much.

283
00:11:24,192 --> 00:11:25,792
Overeating harms your teeth.

284
00:11:27,592 --> 00:11:28,393
Mom, you...

285
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:29,792
Go back.

286
00:11:30,113 --> 00:11:32,033
Alright. Take care.

287
00:11:40,913 --> 00:11:41,873
(Mom, I have cosmetics.)

288
00:11:41,873 --> 00:11:43,353
- (I'll do it for you.)
- (Okay.)

289
00:11:44,832 --> 00:11:46,033
More on the top.

290
00:11:47,064 --> 00:11:48,233
- Take a look.
- Okay.

291
00:12:04,353 --> 00:12:05,712
Tell me

292
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:07,633
what exactly is Youyou's problem?

293
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,193
Is it physical,

294
00:12:09,193 --> 00:12:10,513
or psychological?

295
00:12:10,712 --> 00:12:12,792
Either she's cooped up at home,

296
00:12:12,792 --> 00:12:13,832
not even going out door,

297
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:16,072
or she goes out all of a sudden,

298
00:12:16,072 --> 00:12:17,633
without a trace.

299
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,072
I have to find a chance

300
00:12:23,072 --> 00:12:24,672
to go to her company and take a look.

301
00:12:25,072 --> 00:12:26,472
What's really going on.

302
00:12:29,153 --> 00:12:30,153
What do you think?

303
00:12:38,712 --> 00:12:40,273
Carefree.

304
00:12:40,832 --> 00:12:42,192
Fall asleep right away.

305
00:12:56,873 --> 00:12:57,873
Master,

306
00:12:57,993 --> 00:12:59,592
you are now

307
00:12:59,753 --> 00:13:02,104
like Hong Qigong
in The Legend of the Condor Heroes,

308
00:13:02,104 --> 00:13:03,952
or sweeper monk
from Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils.

309
00:13:04,273 --> 00:13:05,976
A true hidden master.

310
00:13:06,913 --> 00:13:08,568
You are already so wealthy

311
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:09,672
with such a good car.

312
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:11,273
Why are you still working here?

313
00:13:11,913 --> 00:13:12,913
I'm lucky.

314
00:13:13,113 --> 00:13:14,432
My ancestors left some money

315
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:16,353
enough for me in this lifetime

316
00:13:16,353 --> 00:13:19,393
to live both idly yet comfortably.

317
00:13:20,792 --> 00:13:22,432
But what's your logic?

318
00:13:22,432 --> 00:13:23,193
I have money,

319
00:13:23,193 --> 00:13:24,753
so I can't work here?

320
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:26,873
Isn't it exactly because

321
00:13:26,873 --> 00:13:28,033
I don't lack money

322
00:13:28,033 --> 00:13:28,754
that I can be here

323
00:13:28,754 --> 00:13:30,513
comfortably enjoying my retirement?

324
00:13:33,033 --> 00:13:35,273
It sounds quite reasonable.

325
00:13:35,832 --> 00:13:36,593
But why does it

326
00:13:36,593 --> 00:13:37,913
feel a bit strange?

327
00:13:38,273 --> 00:13:39,633
You're only in your forties,

328
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:40,274
besides,

329
00:13:40,274 --> 00:13:41,712
who retires in a cemetery?

330
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,113
What's strange about it?

331
00:13:43,472 --> 00:13:44,472
Let me tell you.

332
00:13:44,913 --> 00:13:45,874
The cemetery

333
00:13:45,874 --> 00:13:46,913
is the final place

334
00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:48,153
for all of us.

335
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:50,832
I'm just coming here early

336
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:51,514
to get used to

337
00:13:51,514 --> 00:13:53,273
the last home in life,

338
00:13:53,273 --> 00:13:53,953
right?

339
00:13:53,953 --> 00:13:56,672
Get along well with the neighbors

340
00:13:56,672 --> 00:13:57,433
while I still

341
00:13:57,433 --> 00:13:59,472
have a little bit of influence

342
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:00,952
to bring some benefits to everyone,

343
00:14:00,952 --> 00:14:01,952
right?

344
00:14:02,273 --> 00:14:03,873
Honestly speaking,

345
00:14:03,873 --> 00:14:06,312
in the whole Jiang City cemetery,

346
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:08,472
which has the best greenery?

347
00:14:08,753 --> 00:14:10,913
It must be ours.

348
00:14:11,072 --> 00:14:12,072
And whose credit is that?

349
00:14:12,153 --> 00:14:13,753
Because of you, Master.

350
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:15,753
That's right.

351
00:14:17,832 --> 00:14:18,394
Master,

352
00:14:18,394 --> 00:14:20,113
during the day,
you're quite into wellness

353
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,472
hot water, Goji berry, Baduanjin.

354
00:14:23,472 --> 00:14:24,712
Why

355
00:14:24,712 --> 00:14:25,952
eat barbecue, hot pot

356
00:14:25,952 --> 00:14:26,952
and liquor at night?

357
00:14:28,353 --> 00:14:29,353
Punk wellness?

358
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:31,633
Is living healthily while taking risks?

359
00:14:33,033 --> 00:14:34,312
What?

360
00:14:34,312 --> 00:14:35,192
Young girl,

361
00:14:35,192 --> 00:14:36,113
how come it's so

362
00:14:36,113 --> 00:14:36,994
straightforward?

363
00:14:36,994 --> 00:14:38,633
Go outside the door
and spit three times.

364
00:14:38,633 --> 00:14:39,233
I...

365
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:40,233
Hurry up.

366
00:14:42,952 --> 00:14:44,153
Let me tell you,

367
00:14:44,432 --> 00:14:46,353
this is called enjoying life.

368
00:14:46,712 --> 00:14:47,873
Living healthy

369
00:14:47,873 --> 00:14:50,273
is because life is worth it.

370
00:14:50,273 --> 00:14:50,914
Right?

371
00:14:50,914 --> 00:14:52,393
The more, the better.

372
00:14:52,552 --> 00:14:53,952
Eating and drinking

373
00:14:53,952 --> 00:14:55,952
is because life is short.

374
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:57,072
Do you know?

375
00:14:57,072 --> 00:14:58,393
Seize the moment and enjoy life.

376
00:14:58,592 --> 00:15:00,712
Don't waste time.

377
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:02,633
Come on.

378
00:15:05,753 --> 00:15:07,552
Why is someone coming so late?

379
00:15:10,592 --> 00:15:11,633
Where are you going?

380
00:15:11,913 --> 00:15:13,672
Who comes here
in the middle of the night?

381
00:15:13,672 --> 00:15:15,072
How do you know it's a person?

382
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:17,153
If it's not a person,

383
00:15:17,393 --> 00:15:18,192
it's a ghost?

384
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:19,312
Go.

385
00:15:19,472 --> 00:15:20,712
I taught you

386
00:15:20,712 --> 00:15:21,832
every trade has its rules.

387
00:15:22,432 --> 00:15:23,192
Sorry.

388
00:15:23,192 --> 00:15:23,993
She is a newcomer.

389
00:15:23,993 --> 00:15:24,673
Heaven and earth,

390
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:25,993
I'm sorry.

391
00:15:27,712 --> 00:15:28,712
Don't be afraid.

392
00:15:29,432 --> 00:15:30,432
I'm here.

393
00:15:30,432 --> 00:15:31,432
Wait.

394
00:15:31,993 --> 00:15:33,033
I'm not afraid.

395
00:15:39,913 --> 00:15:42,033
Yiersan, come here.

396
00:15:44,072 --> 00:15:46,273
Yiersan, come here.

397
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:49,513
- Yiersan...
- Yiersan, come back.

398
00:15:56,792 --> 00:15:57,952
Alright, come on.

399
00:15:58,072 --> 00:15:58,873
You are back.

400
00:15:58,873 --> 00:15:59,928
- Done with it.
- So quick.

401
00:16:00,432 --> 00:16:01,552
I-I'm not scared.

402
00:16:01,552 --> 00:16:02,354
Do you know?

403
00:16:02,354 --> 00:16:04,273
T-This is the rule.

404
00:16:04,712 --> 00:16:05,753
In this place,

405
00:16:05,753 --> 00:16:07,672
you can't speak loudly at night.

406
00:16:07,832 --> 00:16:08,873
I-I tell you,

407
00:16:08,873 --> 00:16:10,312
there's so much you need to learn.

408
00:16:10,312 --> 00:16:12,273
You must learn well from me
in the future.

409
00:16:12,273 --> 00:16:13,273
You know?

410
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:15,993
Learn well from Master.

411
00:16:27,832 --> 00:16:28,993
Brush teeth and go to sleep.

412
00:17:41,113 --> 00:17:42,153
It's so late.

413
00:17:42,153 --> 00:17:43,913
Why haven't they come back yet?

414
00:17:44,712 --> 00:17:45,554
He

415
00:17:45,554 --> 00:17:46,593
said there's traffic.

416
00:17:46,593 --> 00:17:47,752
No more than ten minutes.

417
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:14,952
Cold drinks at night?

418
00:18:14,952 --> 00:18:16,272
You're asking for trouble.

419
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:18,833
Better than causing other issues.

420
00:18:27,153 --> 00:18:27,752
Hello?

421
00:18:27,752 --> 00:18:28,673
We're downstairs.

422
00:18:28,673 --> 00:18:29,712
I'll take children up.

423
00:18:29,712 --> 00:18:30,432
No need.

424
00:18:30,432 --> 00:18:31,432
I come down to get them.

425
00:18:32,192 --> 00:18:33,192
Okay.

426
00:18:33,472 --> 00:18:34,472
They have arrived.

427
00:18:34,793 --> 00:18:35,793
I'll go down to get them.

428
00:18:35,793 --> 00:18:36,793
I'll go too.

429
00:18:42,393 --> 00:18:43,393
Where is the person?

430
00:18:43,512 --> 00:18:44,512
Where did they go?

431
00:18:57,793 --> 00:18:59,113
(To apologize)

432
00:18:59,113 --> 00:19:00,113
(and pursue her,)

433
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:01,394
(I bought her)

434
00:19:01,394 --> 00:19:02,472
(a semester's breakfasts.)

435
00:19:02,472 --> 00:19:03,032
(By doing so,)

436
00:19:03,032 --> 00:19:04,032
(we got together.)

437
00:19:04,113 --> 00:19:04,992
(Now, I)

438
00:19:04,992 --> 00:19:05,793
(came here)

439
00:19:05,793 --> 00:19:06,593
(to pursue her)

440
00:19:06,593 --> 00:19:07,393
(and get her back.)

441
00:19:07,393 --> 00:19:08,512
(To pursue her,)

442
00:19:08,512 --> 00:19:09,154
(I topped up)

443
00:19:09,154 --> 00:19:10,952
(a super VIP membership.)

444
00:19:11,353 --> 00:19:12,432
(Really?)

445
00:19:12,752 --> 00:19:13,433
(Honestly,)

446
00:19:13,433 --> 00:19:14,793
(I should be angry.)

447
00:19:15,032 --> 00:19:16,472
(But after hearing your story,)

448
00:19:16,472 --> 00:19:17,672
(and your determination,)

449
00:19:17,992 --> 00:19:20,032
(I can't help but feel a bit moved.)

450
00:19:20,672 --> 00:19:21,193
(All right,)

451
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,553
(let's just be friends.)

452
00:19:22,553 --> 00:19:24,192
- (Let's exchange WeChat.)
- (Okay.)

453
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:24,913
(Exchange WeChat.)

454
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:25,472
(Listen,)

455
00:19:25,472 --> 00:19:26,424
(I have many buddies.)

456
00:19:26,424 --> 00:19:27,896
- Add WeChat?
- (I'll set you up.)

457
00:19:27,896 --> 00:19:28,536
(I think)

458
00:19:28,536 --> 00:19:30,032
(your conditions are pretty good.)

459
00:19:30,432 --> 00:19:31,553
(That, if...)

460
00:19:31,553 --> 00:19:33,313
(If you fail,)

461
00:19:33,553 --> 00:19:34,354
(I'll always give)

462
00:19:34,354 --> 00:19:35,472
(you a chance.)

463
00:19:35,593 --> 00:19:36,472
(No way.)

464
00:19:36,472 --> 00:19:37,913
(I happen to like you.)

465
00:19:38,032 --> 00:19:39,232
Like him?

466
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:39,993
What's good

467
00:19:39,993 --> 00:19:41,393
about him? He...

468
00:19:42,153 --> 00:19:44,432
(Alright, goodbye.)

469
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:46,472
S-Still shake hands?

470
00:19:46,553 --> 00:19:47,833
- (That's it.)
- Not letting go?

471
00:19:47,992 --> 00:19:48,712
Still?

472
00:19:48,712 --> 00:19:49,153
(Goodbye.)

473
00:19:49,153 --> 00:19:49,873
(Okay, bye-bye.)

474
00:19:50,113 --> 00:19:50,752
(Bye-bye.)

475
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,712
- (See you. Bye-bye.)
- See you.

476
00:19:53,032 --> 00:19:53,873
Add WeChat?

477
00:19:53,873 --> 00:19:54,873
Okay.

478
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:55,672
Li Xiaoxiao,

479
00:19:55,752 --> 00:19:57,234
if you go soft again, you're a dog.

480
00:19:59,113 --> 00:20:00,553
Even dogs won't go soft.

481
00:20:05,113 --> 00:20:06,712
Mom said she'll come down to pick us up.

482
00:20:07,313 --> 00:20:08,033
Dami, Xiaomi.

483
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:10,032
- Lili.
- Mom, we're back.

484
00:20:10,512 --> 00:20:11,553
You're back.

485
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,073
Did you have a good day today?

486
00:20:13,073 --> 00:20:14,113
Yes.

487
00:20:14,512 --> 00:20:15,393
Grandpa gave us

488
00:20:15,393 --> 00:20:16,354
a red envelope each.

489
00:20:16,354 --> 00:20:17,873
Mine is more than Xiaomi's.

490
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:19,633
Alright, fine.

491
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:20,594
Hurry go up.

492
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,432
Alright, thanks.

493
00:20:22,672 --> 00:20:23,712
Get up quickly.

494
00:20:25,472 --> 00:20:27,073
Since they had a great time,

495
00:20:27,073 --> 00:20:28,232
I'll transfer deposit to you.

496
00:20:28,232 --> 00:20:28,952
No.

497
00:20:28,952 --> 00:20:29,673
Keep it.

498
00:20:29,673 --> 00:20:30,992
I'll pick them up again.

499
00:20:30,992 --> 00:20:32,393
Let's talk about it next time.

500
00:20:32,393 --> 00:20:33,393
No.

501
00:20:35,313 --> 00:20:37,553
Are you serious with that guy?

502
00:20:38,032 --> 00:20:39,432
What does it have to do with you?

503
00:20:39,913 --> 00:20:40,992
No.

504
00:20:40,992 --> 00:20:41,712
H-He is

505
00:20:41,712 --> 00:20:42,594
more handsome than me.

506
00:20:42,594 --> 00:20:44,353
Do you think this person is reliable?

507
00:20:45,153 --> 00:20:46,913
Initially, I was quite angry.

508
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:48,512
But you said my boyfriend was handsome.

509
00:20:48,593 --> 00:20:50,232
You are honest. Forget it.

510
00:20:50,232 --> 00:20:51,232
No.

511
00:20:51,432 --> 00:20:52,873
I'm doing it for the good of kids.

512
00:20:52,873 --> 00:20:53,553
He wants to be

513
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:54,554
stepfather of my kids.

514
00:20:54,554 --> 00:20:55,793
I must handle it.

515
00:20:55,793 --> 00:20:56,873
When you found a stepmother

516
00:20:56,873 --> 00:20:57,594
for them,

517
00:20:57,594 --> 00:20:58,913
did you get my consent?

518
00:20:59,153 --> 00:21:00,672
Mind your own business.

519
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:02,633
Wait.

520
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:29,992
(Hu Xiaojiao)
(I gave you a chance)

521
00:21:29,992 --> 00:21:31,032
(to give him back to you,)

522
00:21:31,032 --> 00:21:32,472
(but you didn't want him.)

523
00:21:32,712 --> 00:21:33,913
(Since you gave up,)

524
00:21:33,913 --> 00:21:35,793
(I hope your words match your actions.)

525
00:21:38,712 --> 00:21:39,553
(Coincidentally,)

526
00:21:39,633 --> 00:21:40,712
(I just want to tell you,)

527
00:21:40,712 --> 00:21:42,232
(keep an eye on your own husband.)

528
00:21:42,232 --> 00:21:43,193
(Don't let him)

529
00:21:43,193 --> 00:21:44,633
(always worry about my matters.)

530
00:22:01,873 --> 00:22:02,672
Honey,

531
00:22:02,793 --> 00:22:04,393
did I do well today?

532
00:22:04,752 --> 00:22:07,712
I mopped the floor and washed the dishes
at your mom's house.

533
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:09,113
I even did her makeup.

534
00:22:09,113 --> 00:22:09,874
See that?

535
00:22:09,874 --> 00:22:11,313
She was so happy.

536
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:12,873
I know,

537
00:22:13,272 --> 00:22:15,232
when your mom is happy, you're happy.

538
00:22:15,232 --> 00:22:16,032
Our life

539
00:22:16,032 --> 00:22:17,033
will be lived well.

540
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:18,512
I won't argue with her again.

541
00:22:19,752 --> 00:22:21,153
Where are your cosmetics?

542
00:22:24,113 --> 00:22:25,113
In the bag.

543
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,153
Take them out.

544
00:22:30,553 --> 00:22:32,432
Why are you looking at cosmetics?

545
00:22:34,113 --> 00:22:35,472
I can turn back

546
00:22:35,913 --> 00:22:36,952
and help you fish them

547
00:22:36,952 --> 00:22:38,032
out of the trash can.

548
00:22:41,752 --> 00:22:43,512
You... You saw it.

549
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,074
Don't misunderstand,

550
00:22:45,074 --> 00:22:46,593
I was just thinking

551
00:22:46,712 --> 00:22:49,232
that her illness is cancer.

552
00:22:49,232 --> 00:22:49,794
I'm afraid it

553
00:22:49,794 --> 00:22:51,153
may not be good for the baby.

554
00:22:51,153 --> 00:22:52,114
Nothing else.

555
00:22:52,114 --> 00:22:53,712
Don't say so many nice things.

556
00:22:55,712 --> 00:22:57,192
You just think my mom is dirty.

557
00:22:57,313 --> 00:22:58,952
No, I really don't think she is dirty.

558
00:22:58,952 --> 00:22:59,594
I'm just afraid

559
00:22:59,594 --> 00:23:01,313
it's not good for the baby
inside my belly.

560
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,633
I don't dare to use it.

561
00:23:15,512 --> 00:23:17,752
Mom, what is this?

562
00:23:17,913 --> 00:23:18,593
Today,

563
00:23:18,593 --> 00:23:19,394
I will tell you

564
00:23:19,394 --> 00:23:21,032
a new story,

565
00:23:21,032 --> 00:23:23,472
called The Green Curtain of the City.

566
00:23:23,672 --> 00:23:25,153
What is the green curtain?

567
00:23:25,272 --> 00:23:25,953
During holidays,

568
00:23:25,953 --> 00:23:26,992
did I take you

569
00:23:26,992 --> 00:23:28,553
to a rural homestead?

570
00:23:28,553 --> 00:23:29,553
Yes.

571
00:23:29,672 --> 00:23:31,353
In those rural areas,

572
00:23:31,353 --> 00:23:33,472
like sorghum or corn,

573
00:23:33,472 --> 00:23:35,073
before they ripen,

574
00:23:35,073 --> 00:23:36,512
these green crops

575
00:23:36,512 --> 00:23:38,952
are like a green curtain.

576
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:40,473
In such places,

577
00:23:40,473 --> 00:23:42,232
once children are caught inside,

578
00:23:42,232 --> 00:23:43,393
nobody can find them.

579
00:23:44,232 --> 00:23:45,712
Now I have a question.

580
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,432
In our city,

581
00:23:47,432 --> 00:23:47,953
is there

582
00:23:47,953 --> 00:23:49,873
a place like the green curtain,

583
00:23:49,873 --> 00:23:50,513
where children

584
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:51,752
once caught inside,

585
00:23:51,752 --> 00:23:52,952
nobody can find them?

586
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:54,353
Uninhabited places.

587
00:23:54,353 --> 00:23:55,032
Right.

588
00:23:55,232 --> 00:23:56,232
Construction sites.

589
00:23:56,472 --> 00:23:57,472
Ruins.

590
00:23:57,913 --> 00:23:59,353
Parks at night.

591
00:23:59,353 --> 00:24:00,153
Very good.

592
00:24:00,153 --> 00:24:00,834
Come on.

593
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:02,192
Now I'm going to tell you

594
00:24:02,192 --> 00:24:04,353
a new version of the fairy tale
Little Red Riding Hood.

595
00:24:05,232 --> 00:24:06,232
Once upon a time,

596
00:24:06,232 --> 00:24:06,634
there was

597
00:24:06,634 --> 00:24:07,913
a very cute girl

598
00:24:07,913 --> 00:24:09,232
named Little Red Cap.

599
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:11,113
One day, her grandma got sick,

600
00:24:11,232 --> 00:24:13,073
so she had to visit her grandma.

601
00:24:13,073 --> 00:24:13,473
But

602
00:24:13,473 --> 00:24:14,873
her grandma lived in the city's

603
00:24:14,873 --> 00:24:15,433
other side,

604
00:24:15,433 --> 00:24:17,272
so she had to take a long ride.

605
00:24:17,472 --> 00:24:18,154
Before leaving,

606
00:24:18,154 --> 00:24:19,793
her mom told Little Red Hat,

607
00:24:19,913 --> 00:24:21,353
"You must take the bus,

608
00:24:21,353 --> 00:24:22,833
and don't talk to strangers."

609
00:24:23,992 --> 00:24:25,672
Ruining another world classic.

610
00:24:27,432 --> 00:24:28,752
Even more, don't go

611
00:24:28,752 --> 00:24:29,992
with strangers.

612
00:24:30,472 --> 00:24:31,074
But,

613
00:24:31,074 --> 00:24:32,752
Little Red Hat didn't listen.

614
00:24:32,752 --> 00:24:33,793
On the way,

615
00:24:33,793 --> 00:24:35,633
she found

616
00:24:35,633 --> 00:24:38,073
a cute kitten on the road.

617
00:24:38,192 --> 00:24:39,353
She suddenly got off.

618
00:24:46,913 --> 00:24:47,913
Have you got it done?

619
00:24:48,073 --> 00:24:49,073
Going to sleep.

620
00:24:51,952 --> 00:24:52,952
Yu'an, Yule.

621
00:24:56,353 --> 00:24:57,472
Why don't you answer me?

622
00:25:00,873 --> 00:25:01,873
Yu'an, Yule,

623
00:25:03,432 --> 00:25:04,553
come out. Stop playing.

624
00:25:08,232 --> 00:25:09,232
Yu'an, Yule.

625
00:25:10,272 --> 00:25:11,272
Yu'an, Yule.

626
00:25:22,192 --> 00:25:23,672
The big tiger is coming.

627
00:25:25,913 --> 00:25:26,913
Dad.

628
00:25:26,913 --> 00:25:28,153
Dad.

629
00:25:28,393 --> 00:25:29,073
Dad.

630
00:25:29,073 --> 00:25:30,073
Alright.

631
00:25:30,472 --> 00:25:31,192
Alright.

632
00:25:31,192 --> 00:25:31,913
Dad.

633
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:32,753
Stop.

634
00:25:32,753 --> 00:25:34,353
Hurry up. Go back to sleep.

635
00:25:35,553 --> 00:25:36,553
No.

636
00:25:36,633 --> 00:25:37,873
I don't want to either.

637
00:25:38,113 --> 00:25:39,192
Quick, go back.

638
00:25:39,432 --> 00:25:40,664
- No.
- No.

639
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,272
No.

640
00:25:41,512 --> 00:25:44,152
No.

641
00:25:44,152 --> 00:25:45,313
Alright.

642
00:25:45,593 --> 00:25:46,793
Then you can sleep here.

643
00:25:47,153 --> 00:25:48,272
Only for one night.

644
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:50,032
Tomorrow, both of you

645
00:25:50,032 --> 00:25:50,874
go back

646
00:25:50,874 --> 00:25:51,913
to your room to sleep.

647
00:25:52,353 --> 00:25:53,314
You're grown up.

648
00:25:53,314 --> 00:25:54,393
You can't sleep with me.

649
00:25:54,393 --> 00:25:55,153
Got it?

650
00:25:55,272 --> 00:25:56,432
Understood, Dad.

651
00:25:56,432 --> 00:25:57,992
You're really nagging.

652
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:01,192
You've said it several times already.

653
00:26:01,472 --> 00:26:02,472
Alright.

654
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:03,833
Okay, sleep.

655
00:26:05,672 --> 00:26:07,393
Dad, I want to hear a story.

656
00:26:08,553 --> 00:26:09,472
Listen to a story?

657
00:26:09,472 --> 00:26:10,113
Okay.

658
00:26:10,313 --> 00:26:11,512
I will tell you

659
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:14,913
the story of Boonie Bears.

660
00:26:15,232 --> 00:26:16,232
- No.
- No.

661
00:26:16,472 --> 00:26:17,354
Just go to sleep.

662
00:26:17,354 --> 00:26:18,328
Sleep.

663
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:19,064
I want to sleep.

664
00:26:19,793 --> 00:26:21,393
Okay, sleep now.

665
00:26:57,633 --> 00:26:59,768
Move in.

666
00:27:00,032 --> 00:27:02,032
Kaixin, comfort me.

667
00:27:02,032 --> 00:27:03,472
I'm emotional.

668
00:27:03,793 --> 00:27:05,472
Why are you emotional again?

669
00:27:05,913 --> 00:27:07,353
You're emotional all day long,

670
00:27:07,353 --> 00:27:09,313
more often than meals a day?

671
00:27:09,472 --> 00:27:10,473
No man comforts me.

672
00:27:10,473 --> 00:27:11,672
Can't you comfort me?

673
00:27:11,672 --> 00:27:13,656
Comfort me.

674
00:27:13,848 --> 00:27:14,968
What's wrong with you?

675
00:27:14,968 --> 00:27:16,353
Can't even straighten the tongue.

676
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:17,553
Quick, go to sleep.

677
00:27:17,553 --> 00:27:18,553
Hurry up.

678
00:27:19,192 --> 00:27:20,192
Get up quickly.

679
00:27:21,032 --> 00:27:22,432
I have to get up early tomorrow.

680
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:23,074
Tomorrow I

681
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,672
have several cakes to make.

682
00:27:24,672 --> 00:27:25,992
An order from the college town

683
00:27:25,992 --> 00:27:27,833
contains over 40 sandwiches.

684
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:28,673
I have to

685
00:27:28,673 --> 00:27:30,272
get up 4 AM tomorrow.

686
00:27:30,272 --> 00:27:31,272
Really.

687
00:27:31,593 --> 00:27:32,633
Quick.

688
00:27:32,633 --> 00:27:33,633
Kaixin,

689
00:27:34,553 --> 00:27:35,114
am I

690
00:27:35,114 --> 00:27:36,833
unmarriageable?

691
00:27:37,192 --> 00:27:37,913
I'm all mouth,

692
00:27:37,913 --> 00:27:38,794
actually in my heart,

693
00:27:38,794 --> 00:27:40,232
I really want to get married.

694
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,553
Isn't this a pretty normal thought?

695
00:27:47,873 --> 00:27:48,873
Then tell me.

696
00:27:49,672 --> 00:27:52,113
Isn't getting married still pretty good?

697
00:27:53,393 --> 00:27:54,992
Why else would you get married

698
00:27:54,992 --> 00:27:56,272
again after a divorce?

699
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:57,833
After all these years

700
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:58,833
in remarriage business,

701
00:27:58,913 --> 00:28:00,192
I've seen so many people

702
00:28:00,192 --> 00:28:01,074
who've been through

703
00:28:01,074 --> 00:28:02,113
rough first marriages,

704
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:03,032
but they still want

705
00:28:03,032 --> 00:28:03,993
to try again,

706
00:28:03,993 --> 00:28:05,353
no matter the cost.

707
00:28:06,073 --> 00:28:06,673
This shows

708
00:28:06,673 --> 00:28:08,313
marriage is still quite sweet.

709
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:08,874
But

710
00:28:08,874 --> 00:28:11,313
why can't I get married?

711
00:28:11,313 --> 00:28:12,313
Kaixin.

712
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:15,512
Marriage has its own charm,

713
00:28:15,512 --> 00:28:17,432
while singleness
boasts its unique allure.

714
00:28:17,432 --> 00:28:18,913
Marriage is like a city.

715
00:28:18,913 --> 00:28:20,553
Being single is also like a city.

716
00:28:20,752 --> 00:28:21,712
Maybe they just

717
00:28:21,712 --> 00:28:22,713
want to switch cities

718
00:28:22,713 --> 00:28:24,232
for a change.

719
00:28:24,992 --> 00:28:26,032
I really hate those

720
00:28:26,032 --> 00:28:27,272
who create opposition.

721
00:28:27,353 --> 00:28:28,472
Married people say

722
00:28:28,472 --> 00:28:30,833
unmarried people will have
no support in old age.

723
00:28:30,833 --> 00:28:32,712
Unmarried people say married people

724
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:34,073
are not living freely enough.

725
00:28:34,472 --> 00:28:35,952
All that matters

726
00:28:35,952 --> 00:28:36,673
in life

727
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:37,793
is living life

728
00:28:37,793 --> 00:28:39,992
to the fullest, your way.

729
00:28:40,192 --> 00:28:41,752
If you want kids, have them.

730
00:28:41,752 --> 00:28:42,952
If not,

731
00:28:42,952 --> 00:28:43,992
be child-free.

732
00:28:44,393 --> 00:28:45,913
You see. It's only those

733
00:28:45,913 --> 00:28:46,834
internet trolls

734
00:28:46,834 --> 00:28:47,992
focus on

735
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:49,554
whether it is good or bad.

736
00:28:49,554 --> 00:28:50,952
No one with any sense

737
00:28:50,952 --> 00:28:52,073
would bother with that.

738
00:28:52,672 --> 00:28:54,032
How about you and Mei Chengyi?

739
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:55,353
I've considered it for a while.

740
00:28:55,472 --> 00:28:56,472
We won't get married.

741
00:28:56,712 --> 00:28:58,593
Because of today's incident?

742
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:01,353
Regarding this incident,

743
00:29:01,353 --> 00:29:02,873
I can really understand him.

744
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,073
If it were me,

745
00:29:04,073 --> 00:29:05,633
I would be even angrier than him.

746
00:29:06,232 --> 00:29:07,752
But understanding is understanding,

747
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,432
it's still okay to be angry.

748
00:29:11,272 --> 00:29:11,874
This incident

749
00:29:11,874 --> 00:29:13,472
has made me realize one thing.

750
00:29:14,353 --> 00:29:15,273
For people like us,

751
00:29:15,273 --> 00:29:17,353
a remarriage couple, both with two kids,

752
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:18,794
if we were the kind

753
00:29:18,794 --> 00:29:20,712
with super wealthy conditions,
that's okay.

754
00:29:20,712 --> 00:29:22,712
But we're just ordinary folk.

755
00:29:22,913 --> 00:29:24,553
So we still need to help each other.

756
00:29:24,553 --> 00:29:25,712
Never live

757
00:29:25,712 --> 00:29:27,113
under one roof.

758
00:29:27,113 --> 00:29:28,033
Otherwise,

759
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:30,272
trouble is bound to happen.

760
00:29:31,952 --> 00:29:33,153
You want to break up with him?

761
00:29:33,153 --> 00:29:33,993
That's impossible.

762
00:29:33,993 --> 00:29:35,073
Given his current stature,

763
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:36,113
I can't bear to.

764
00:29:36,272 --> 00:29:37,313
Then what do you mean?

765
00:29:37,313 --> 00:29:39,432
Think of solutions on the spot.

766
00:29:39,992 --> 00:29:40,794
Aren't we supposed

767
00:29:40,794 --> 00:29:42,873
to be family partners?

768
00:29:42,873 --> 00:29:44,192
Then we can follow the contract

769
00:29:44,192 --> 00:29:45,432
to fulfill obligations.

770
00:29:45,593 --> 00:29:47,073
It can be renewed annually.

771
00:29:47,192 --> 00:29:47,913
At that time,

772
00:29:47,913 --> 00:29:48,914
if anyone feels bad,

773
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:50,272
the contract can be terminated.

774
00:29:51,593 --> 00:29:52,752
Got it.

775
00:29:53,073 --> 00:29:55,313
You don't want the burdens of marriage,

776
00:29:55,313 --> 00:29:55,914
but

777
00:29:55,914 --> 00:29:57,752
you can't let go of Mei Chengyi.

778
00:29:59,952 --> 00:30:02,393
He is too alluring.

779
00:30:02,393 --> 00:30:04,752
Don't blame me for longing for it.

780
00:30:05,873 --> 00:30:06,673
But I think

781
00:30:06,673 --> 00:30:09,232
Mei Chengyi genuinely wants a wife.

782
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:10,633
Can he agree?

783
00:30:10,633 --> 00:30:12,393
If he doesn't sincerely want a wife,

784
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,952
I wouldn't like him either.

785
00:30:14,232 --> 00:30:15,193
I'm telling you,

786
00:30:15,193 --> 00:30:16,712
whether a man wants to marry

787
00:30:16,712 --> 00:30:18,153
and whether a woman wants to marry

788
00:30:18,153 --> 00:30:19,712
are completely different things.

789
00:30:19,712 --> 00:30:20,433
If he is that type

790
00:30:20,433 --> 00:30:21,712
of irresponsible man,

791
00:30:21,712 --> 00:30:23,113
how would I be interested in him?

792
00:30:23,393 --> 00:30:25,153
Hurry up and sleep, Miss.

793
00:30:25,353 --> 00:30:26,032
Bluster.

794
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:26,874
I can only sleep

795
00:30:26,874 --> 00:30:28,232
for four or five hours.

796
00:30:28,232 --> 00:30:28,992
I'll set an alarm.

797
00:30:28,992 --> 00:30:29,992
Alright, sleep.

798
00:30:39,393 --> 00:30:40,393
Stay away from me.

799
00:30:41,553 --> 00:30:42,553
Jealousy.

800
00:30:44,793 --> 00:30:45,793
Disgusting.

801
00:30:56,952 --> 00:30:58,272
So childish.

802
00:31:39,913 --> 00:31:40,913
Are you sick?

803
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:41,992
Not sleeping, huh?

804
00:31:41,992 --> 00:31:42,992
Go back to your room.

805
00:31:43,272 --> 00:31:44,272
Dirty.

806
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:45,833
Dirty, right?

807
00:31:45,952 --> 00:31:46,594
Tomorrow, I will

808
00:31:46,594 --> 00:31:47,992
abort the child.

809
00:31:47,992 --> 00:31:48,992
Would you dare?

810
00:31:49,472 --> 00:31:50,154
You know

811
00:31:50,154 --> 00:31:51,393
whether I dare or not!

812
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:03,032
(If you need me at night,)

813
00:34:03,472 --> 00:34:04,593
(don't knock.)

814
00:34:04,593 --> 00:34:05,314
(Here,)

815
00:34:05,314 --> 00:34:07,153
(knocking on the door
can scare me to death.)

816
00:34:08,072 --> 00:34:08,833
(Make a call.)

817
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:09,833
(Okay?)

818
00:34:45,873 --> 00:34:46,952
It's so noisy.

819
00:34:46,952 --> 00:34:47,512
Do you believe

820
00:34:47,512 --> 00:34:48,873
I would stew you?

821
00:34:55,952 --> 00:34:57,552
Do you want to pee?

822
00:34:59,952 --> 00:35:00,992
Alright.

823
00:35:01,193 --> 00:35:02,273
So much trouble.

824
00:35:02,273 --> 00:35:02,873
Let's go.

825
00:35:03,032 --> 00:35:04,512
Go.

826
00:35:04,512 --> 00:35:05,512
Quickly.

827
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:08,673
Go.

828
00:35:16,552 --> 00:35:18,673
Why did you come to Youyou's room?

829
00:35:19,632 --> 00:35:20,753
Youyou.

830
00:35:21,592 --> 00:35:22,393
See?

831
00:35:22,393 --> 00:35:23,073
I told you

832
00:35:23,073 --> 00:35:24,753
she's asleep.

833
00:35:24,753 --> 00:35:26,472
Even banging drums wouldn't wake her up.

834
00:35:26,472 --> 00:35:27,713
This isn't my fault.

835
00:35:34,112 --> 00:35:35,112
No.

836
00:35:35,273 --> 00:35:36,273
You.

837
00:35:36,552 --> 00:35:39,512
Do you mean Youyou went outside?

838
00:35:42,032 --> 00:35:45,072
Is this girl really daring
or just pretending?

839
00:35:45,233 --> 00:35:47,152
She's going to the cemetery
at this hour?

840
00:35:47,152 --> 00:35:48,152
Is she...?

841
00:35:50,592 --> 00:35:52,072
Alright, stop.

842
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:53,713
Spinning makes me dizzy.

843
00:35:54,632 --> 00:35:55,632
Wait.

844
00:36:13,152 --> 00:36:15,273
Yiersan, go.

845
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:01,833
Yiersan!

846
00:37:02,432 --> 00:37:03,632
Why are you here?

847
00:37:08,393 --> 00:37:09,753
A ghost!

848
00:37:10,032 --> 00:37:11,032
M-Master.

849
00:37:11,032 --> 00:37:12,032
Master, it's me.

850
00:37:12,673 --> 00:37:13,673
It's me.

851
00:37:17,753 --> 00:37:19,273
Do you want to scare me to death?

852
00:37:19,873 --> 00:37:20,874
In the dead of night,

853
00:37:20,874 --> 00:37:22,193
what are you doing here?

854
00:37:22,472 --> 00:37:23,472
You...

855
00:37:28,032 --> 00:37:29,032
Little ghost,

856
00:37:29,713 --> 00:37:31,472
I usually treat you all well.

857
00:37:32,273 --> 00:37:33,913
This is not the place you should be.

858
00:37:34,432 --> 00:37:36,793
Go back to where you came from.

859
00:37:37,233 --> 00:37:38,313
Don't push me.

860
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,952
Or else I'll take action.

861
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:42,793
Don't push me.

862
00:37:50,112 --> 00:37:51,112
Youyou.

863
00:37:51,432 --> 00:37:52,432
Youyou.

864
00:37:56,472 --> 00:37:58,233
Don't come over.

865
00:37:58,233 --> 00:37:59,713
Youyou, wake up.

866
00:37:59,713 --> 00:38:00,833
Wake up, Youyou.

867
00:38:00,833 --> 00:38:01,873
Hurry up.

868
00:38:01,873 --> 00:38:03,313
Youyou, get up quickly.

869
00:38:03,313 --> 00:38:04,432
Wake up.

870
00:38:06,432 --> 00:38:07,234
Don't scare me.

871
00:38:07,234 --> 00:38:08,592
Youyou, wake up.

872
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:10,913
Don't come over.

884
00:40:30,552 --> 00:40:31,552

Did you hear me?

887
00:40:41,673 --> 00:40:42,673
Dad.

888
00:40:44,632 --> 00:40:46,193
I miss my mom.

889
00:40:52,632 --> 00:40:53,673
I'm sorry.

890
00:40:55,992 --> 00:40:56,992
I'm sorry.

891
00:40:58,032 --> 00:40:59,753
I didn't take good care of your mom.

892
00:40:59,753 --> 00:41:00,753
I'm sorry.

893
00:41:35,592 --> 00:41:36,432
Thank you.

894
00:41:36,432 --> 00:41:37,353

00:41:38,552 --> 00:41:39,913
Goodbye.

897
00:41:39,913 --> 00:41:40,913
Bye-bye.

898
00:41:49,793 --> 00:41:50,952
It was so touching.

899
00:41:51,432 --> 00:41:53,273
When I was little, I read a story

900
00:41:53,793 --> 00:41:55,512
about how a child who misses their mom

901
00:41:55,673 --> 00:41:57,233
can draw one on the ground

902
00:41:57,233 --> 00:41:59,112
and sleep on her belly.

903
00:42:00,353 --> 00:42:01,113
I used to think

904
00:42:01,113 --> 00:42:02,472
it was a literary technique.

905
00:42:02,632 --> 00:42:04,592
I didn't expect such a thing to be true.

906
00:42:05,512 --> 00:42:06,873
Such a young child

907
00:42:07,313 --> 00:42:08,512
could actually come

908
00:42:08,512 --> 00:42:10,032
here to see Mom at midnight.

909
00:42:11,393 --> 00:42:13,032
Perhaps he really hopes

910
00:42:13,233 --> 00:42:14,632
there are ghosts in this world.

911
00:42:17,512 --> 00:42:18,473
But I just thought

912
00:42:18,473 --> 00:42:19,952
his dad would really hit him.

913
00:42:19,952 --> 00:42:21,432
Even if I didn't stop his dad,

914
00:42:21,992 --> 00:42:23,432
he

915
00:42:23,632 --> 00:42:24,873
even can't fight.

916
00:42:25,592 --> 00:42:27,193
I didn't use any force.

917
00:42:33,152 --> 00:42:34,913
Look at you.

918
00:42:36,152 --> 00:42:38,512
Your face is all smeared.

919
00:42:38,512 --> 00:42:39,512
Here you are.

00:42:40,353 --> 00:42:41,194
At night,

921
00:42:41,194 --> 00:42:42,992
you went to cemetery alone

922
00:42:42,992 --> 00:42:44,713
and got scared unconscious by a child.

923
00:42:46,193 --> 00:42:48,112
If you don't have the right skills,

924
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:49,793
don't take on that tricky task.

925
00:42:53,552 --> 00:42:54,913
