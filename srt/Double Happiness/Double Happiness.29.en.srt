Come, we're home, quickly.

Grandpa, Grandma.

20
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:46,537
You're here.

21
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:47,537
My dear grandson.

22
00:01:47,537 --> 00:01:48,537
Grandpa.

23
00:01:49,337 --> 00:01:49,936
Mom, mom, mom.

24
00:01:49,936 --> 00:01:50,776
Sit there.

25
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:51,217
Sit down.

26
00:01:51,217 --> 00:01:52,656
Put the schoolbag here.

27
00:01:52,656 --> 00:01:54,817
My dear grandson is here.

28
00:01:54,817 --> 00:01:55,817
Xiaomi.

29
00:01:55,897 --> 00:01:57,496
I missed you a lot.

30
00:01:57,496 --> 00:01:58,537
When I was in hospital,

31
00:01:58,537 --> 00:02:00,016
I kept thinking about you.

32
00:02:00,016 --> 00:02:01,416
Did you miss me?

33
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:03,136
Grandma, I missed you too.

34
00:02:05,617 --> 00:02:07,097
What do you want to eat?

35
00:02:07,097 --> 00:02:08,976
Look, these are for you.

36
00:02:09,137 --> 00:02:10,256
What do you want to eat?

37
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:12,936
Hamburger, fries, and ice cream.

38
00:02:12,936 --> 00:02:13,697
No.

39
00:02:13,697 --> 00:02:15,297
Eating these at night causes cavities.

40
00:02:15,297 --> 00:02:16,178
Mom doesn't allow it.

41
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:17,536
It's okay.

42
00:02:18,057 --> 00:02:19,096
I will go buy it for you.

43
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:20,096
What else do you want?

44
00:02:23,617 --> 00:02:24,617
Toy car.

45
00:02:24,857 --> 00:02:25,578
No.

46
00:02:25,578 --> 00:02:27,096
You have too many toy cars.

47
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:28,417
There's no room at home.

48
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:29,417
Dami.

49
00:02:29,976 --> 00:02:30,817
It's fine.

50
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,057
Since you're here,

51
00:02:32,057 --> 00:02:33,096
you should be happy.

52
00:02:33,096 --> 00:02:33,458
Okay?

53
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,656
I will buy it for you later.

54
00:02:34,656 --> 00:02:35,137
Okay.

55
00:02:35,137 --> 00:02:36,137
Yes, yes, yes.

56
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:38,216
Look.

57
00:02:38,216 --> 00:02:39,018
Today your Grandpa

58
00:02:39,018 --> 00:02:40,737
has prepared a lot of delicious food.

59
00:02:40,737 --> 00:02:41,618
Come and open.

60
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:44,696
So many candies, so happy.

61
00:02:46,696 --> 00:02:47,816
Choose which one to eat.

62
00:02:47,816 --> 00:02:49,417
Come, I will peel this for you.

63
00:02:49,976 --> 00:02:50,697
Dad, Grandma,

64
00:02:50,697 --> 00:02:52,297
don't spoil him like this.

65
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:53,776
It's okay, it's okay.

66
00:02:53,936 --> 00:02:54,936
Once in a while.

67
00:02:56,457 --> 00:02:58,177
Come, I will peel a candy for you.

68
00:02:59,737 --> 00:03:01,656
How happy Grandma is now!

69
00:03:02,577 --> 00:03:03,577
Just this once.

70
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:04,976
Be obedient.

71
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:08,337
Good.

72
00:03:16,376 --> 00:03:17,737
I miss my mom.

My colleague bought it for me.
I won't eat it.

104
00:05:43,496 --> 00:05:44,857
Dami and Xiaomi would enjoy it,

105
00:05:44,857 --> 00:05:45,857
so I brought it back.

106
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:48,136
Mei Chengyi,
you broke the contract, right?

107
00:05:48,136 --> 00:05:49,136
What?

108
00:05:49,417 --> 00:05:50,337
In our contract,

109
00:05:50,337 --> 00:05:51,737
it's clearly written

110
00:05:51,737 --> 00:05:53,057
our birthdays and anniversaries

111
00:05:53,057 --> 00:05:54,696
should be reminded in advance.

112
00:05:54,857 --> 00:05:55,896
Oh my god.

113
00:05:55,896 --> 00:05:57,456
I actually didn't know your birthday.

114
00:05:57,456 --> 00:05:58,617
I haven't celebrated that

115
00:05:58,617 --> 00:05:59,696
since I was young.

116
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:01,376
Just you wait.

117
00:06:05,136 --> 00:06:06,136
Grandma, Grandma.

118
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:07,537
I want to eat

119
00:06:08,217 --> 00:06:09,896
blueberries and watermelon.

120
00:06:09,896 --> 00:06:10,538
Qian Xiaomi,

121
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:11,777
you're getting a bit too cocky.

122
00:06:12,177 --> 00:06:13,737
After eating so many candies,

123
00:06:13,737 --> 00:06:14,256
chocolates

124
00:06:14,256 --> 00:06:15,256
and fruits

125
00:06:15,256 --> 00:06:16,256
you'll get a stomachache.

126
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,057
It's okay, it's okay.

127
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:21,496
Your mom is so mean.

128
00:06:21,696 --> 00:06:22,777

free

130
00:06:23,618 --> 00:06:25,016
to eat here.

131
00:06:25,696 --> 00:06:26,777
Hurry up and wash up.

132
00:06:28,016 --> 00:06:28,817
It's late at night.

133
00:06:28,817 --> 00:06:29,857
Eats so much

134
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:31,097
is really not good.

135
00:06:32,336 --> 00:06:33,657
What's wrong with you?

136
00:06:33,737 --> 00:06:35,217
Why do you always go against me?

137
00:06:35,217 --> 00:06:36,017
Can't you let me

138
00:06:36,017 --> 00:06:37,256
be a bit happier?

139
00:06:37,417 --> 00:06:38,896
Alright, alright, I'll go wash up.

140
00:06:41,496 --> 00:06:42,696
Let me help you.

141
00:06:43,217 --> 00:06:44,537
No need.

142
00:06:46,496 --> 00:06:47,297
You guys

143
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:49,456
really can't spoil Xiaomi like this.

144
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,456
Even the best child can be spoiled.

145
00:06:57,777 --> 00:06:59,136
I just want to tell you something.

146
00:06:59,576 --> 00:07:00,576
What is it?

147
00:07:02,097 --> 00:07:04,696
I'm planning to take you abroad

148
00:07:04,816 --> 00:07:06,057
to get treatment for my mom.

149
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:07,657
I know.

150
00:07:09,297 --> 00:07:10,297
One, two, three.

151
00:07:14,217 --> 00:07:15,936
I want to take Xiaomi with us too.

152
00:07:16,816 --> 00:07:17,816
What?

153
00:07:17,977 --> 00:07:19,016
Are you crazy?

154
00:07:19,657 --> 00:07:21,336
Will Xu Kaixin agree?

155
00:07:22,136 --> 00:07:23,136
None of her business.

156
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:24,816
I am his biological father.

157
00:07:24,816 --> 00:07:26,256
Taking him is not illegal.

158
00:07:26,256 --> 00:07:27,257
As long as we go abroad,

159
00:07:27,257 --> 00:07:28,816
Xu Kaixin won't be able to find us.

160
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:31,256
Isn't this reckless?

161
00:07:32,177 --> 00:07:33,178
Such a young child,

162
00:07:33,178 --> 00:07:34,857
do you think you can just take him away?

163
00:07:34,977 --> 00:07:36,136
He will miss his mom.

164
00:07:36,136 --> 00:07:37,136
I know.

165
00:07:37,217 --> 00:07:38,136
But he is young.

166
00:07:38,136 --> 00:07:39,016
It's easy to coax him.

167
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:39,897
The reason why

168
00:07:39,897 --> 00:07:40,936
I signed that agreement

169
00:07:40,936 --> 00:07:41,778
with Xu Kaixin

170
00:07:41,778 --> 00:07:42,936
is just to lower her guard.

171
00:07:42,936 --> 00:07:43,738
After Xiaomi

172
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:44,977
being with us more time,

173
00:07:44,977 --> 00:07:46,136
and we're used to each other,

174
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:47,496
he won't cause trouble anymore.

175
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:50,978
No, no.

176
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:52,417
You, you can't mess around.

177
00:07:52,576 --> 00:07:53,977
Our family owes Xu Kaixin

178
00:07:53,977 --> 00:07:54,977
too much.

179
00:07:56,696 --> 00:07:58,417
I only care about my mom being well.

180
00:07:58,417 --> 00:08:00,097
I can't bother with others.

181
00:08:04,097 --> 00:08:05,177
You two

182
00:08:05,456 --> 00:08:06,777
are constantly redefining

183
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,256
my understanding of boundaries.

184
00:08:23,217 --> 00:08:24,816
(Buddy, time's up.)

185
00:08:24,816 --> 00:08:25,816
(Have you decided?)

186
00:08:26,217 --> 00:08:27,816
(Do you want money or dignity?)

187
00:08:32,257 --> 00:08:34,576
This is a big deal for you guys.

188
00:08:34,576 --> 00:08:36,417
No business for three years,

189
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:38,096
but one deal can feed you for three.

190
00:08:38,096 --> 00:08:40,616
Why isn't he responding?

191
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:42,497
Send a few more word

192
00:08:42,657 --> 00:08:43,657
to provoke him

193
00:08:44,137 --> 00:08:44,936
and brainwash a bit.

194
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:46,297
What else can I say?

195
00:08:46,297 --> 00:08:46,817
Just these.

196
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:48,736
I've already racked my brain.

197
00:08:48,936 --> 00:08:49,898
So useless.

198
00:08:49,898 --> 00:08:51,137
Come on, get up.

199
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:54,936
That's why I'm the leader.

200
00:08:54,936 --> 00:08:55,936
Right?

201
00:08:58,017 --> 00:08:59,137
Send like this.

202
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:07,976
Since I can find you,

203
00:09:08,777 --> 00:09:10,856
I can naturally also find

204
00:09:10,856 --> 00:09:12,377
your and her relatives and friends.

205
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:13,177
Right?

206
00:09:13,377 --> 00:09:14,097
Right.

207
00:09:14,097 --> 00:09:15,976
Don't say I didn't give you a chance.

208
00:09:16,417 --> 00:09:17,576
Within ten minutes,

209
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:19,616
if I don't see the money,

210
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:21,936
the video and photos

211
00:09:22,017 --> 00:09:24,177
will be sent.

212
00:09:26,137 --> 00:09:28,017
To show my sincerity,

213
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,856
I'll give you another big gift.

214
00:09:32,497 --> 00:09:33,696
This is how you should text.

215
00:09:34,137 --> 00:09:35,137
Learned it?

216
00:09:35,417 --> 00:09:36,576
Just wait.

217
00:11:07,216 --> 00:11:08,777
Why haven't he

218
00:11:08,777 --> 00:11:10,456
given a reply?

219
00:11:10,456 --> 00:11:11,456
Bro.

220
00:11:11,456 --> 00:11:12,696
Did we fail?

221
00:11:12,696 --> 00:11:14,216
What should we do about this?

222
00:11:16,057 --> 00:11:18,017
Did we ask for too much?

223
00:11:18,017 --> 00:11:19,017
Three hundred thousand.

224
00:11:21,216 --> 00:11:22,856
How about lowering it?

225
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,216
Okay.

226
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,216
Lower it.

227
00:11:25,417 --> 00:11:26,777
I originally thought

228
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:27,737
since this woman

229
00:11:27,737 --> 00:11:28,856
tricked us out of 10,000,

230
00:11:28,976 --> 00:11:29,976
we ask for 100,000,

231
00:11:30,177 --> 00:11:31,777
or even 30,000 or 50,000,

232
00:11:31,777 --> 00:11:33,336
to avenge ourselves. That's enough.

233
00:11:33,336 --> 00:11:33,616
Yes.

234
00:11:33,616 --> 00:11:34,577
Only a fool

235
00:11:34,577 --> 00:11:35,657
would give 300,000.

236
00:11:35,657 --> 00:11:36,736
Yes, exactly.

237
00:11:37,976 --> 00:11:40,057
Then I'll add one more thing.

238
00:11:44,856 --> 00:11:46,177
You may think

239
00:11:46,576 --> 00:11:50,057
300,000 is too much for you.

240
00:11:51,616 --> 00:11:53,537
I'm not

241
00:11:53,537 --> 00:11:54,696
unreasonable.

242
00:11:54,696 --> 00:11:56,856
You indeed are also a victim.

243
00:11:57,616 --> 00:12:00,537
I'll give you a discount.

244
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:01,616
If 300,000 is too much,

245
00:12:01,616 --> 00:12:02,417
The money...

246
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:04,657
- then 30,000
- Transferred.

247
00:12:04,856 --> 00:12:05,856
will also be okay.

248
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,537
Quiet, I'm typing.

249
00:12:07,537 --> 00:12:08,897
Transferred.

250
00:12:08,897 --> 00:12:10,497
Money is more important
than face, right?

251
00:12:10,497 --> 00:12:11,736
The money has been transferred.

252
00:12:11,736 --> 00:12:12,138
Has it?

253
00:12:12,138 --> 00:12:13,336
300,000?

254
00:12:16,336 --> 00:12:17,336
No, that...

255
00:12:18,096 --> 00:12:20,417
I just sent it out...

256
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:21,856
What were you doing earlier?

257
00:12:22,017 --> 00:12:23,257
Just tell him.

258
00:12:23,257 --> 00:12:24,696
Redraw it.

259
00:12:30,137 --> 00:12:31,897
(You may think 300,000
is too much for you.)

260
00:12:31,897 --> 00:12:33,537
(I'm not unreasonable.)

261
00:12:33,696 --> 00:12:35,497
(You indeed are also a victim.)

262
00:12:35,856 --> 00:12:37,137
(I'll give you a discount.)

263
00:12:37,137 --> 00:12:38,257
(If 300,000 is too much,)

264
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:40,057
(then 30,000 will also be okay.)

265
00:12:40,216 --> 00:12:41,816
(Money is more important)

266
00:12:41,816 --> 00:12:42,976
(than face, isn't it?)

267
00:12:43,177 --> 00:12:45,057
(Bro, let's make friends.)

268
00:13:05,936 --> 00:13:06,936
Too sudden.

269
00:13:31,216 --> 00:13:31,977
Hello.

270
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,177
I am your bank

271
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:34,177
platinum card user.

272
00:13:34,696 --> 00:13:36,297
I want to ask you something.

273
00:13:38,057 --> 00:13:39,696
If using your bank's card

274
00:13:39,696 --> 00:13:40,976
to transfer money wrongly,

275
00:13:40,976 --> 00:13:43,057
is there a chance to return it back?

276
00:13:46,096 --> 00:13:48,457
For example,
I wanted to transfer 30,000,

277
00:13:48,457 --> 00:13:50,017
but I accidentally transferred 300,000.

278
00:13:54,057 --> 00:13:55,057
300,000.

279
00:13:59,936 --> 00:14:01,976
300,000. 300,000.

280
00:14:01,976 --> 00:14:02,856
Received.

281
00:14:02,856 --> 00:14:03,816
300,000

282
00:14:03,816 --> 00:14:04,777
Received.

283
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:05,777
300,000.

284
00:14:15,616 --> 00:14:16,616
This...

285
00:14:17,017 --> 00:14:18,017
Longevity noodles.

286
00:14:18,616 --> 00:14:19,417
Just this?

287
00:14:19,576 --> 00:14:20,777
This is all you have at home.

288
00:14:22,257 --> 00:14:23,936
No, my home doesn't have this.

289
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:24,817
At the cupboard,

290
00:14:24,817 --> 00:14:25,936
I only found this.

291
00:14:31,696 --> 00:14:33,096
This has been expired for a year.

292
00:14:33,096 --> 00:14:34,336
That's too long, right?

293
00:14:36,137 --> 00:14:37,537
So it's called longevity noodles.

294
00:14:38,417 --> 00:14:39,417
Not satisfied, right?

295
00:14:40,137 --> 00:14:41,137
Just you wait.

296
00:14:49,696 --> 00:14:50,696
Happy birthday!

297
00:14:52,177 --> 00:14:53,177
Xu Kaixin.

298
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:54,816
Are you

299
00:14:55,257 --> 00:14:56,696
going to share my property?

300
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:58,657
No, this is standard.

301
00:15:01,417 --> 00:15:02,777
Okay, okay.

302
00:15:02,897 --> 00:15:04,057
I'll help you,

303
00:15:04,057 --> 00:15:04,537
I help you.

304
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:05,417
Come, one each person.

305
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:06,377
Come, this isn't...

306
00:15:06,377 --> 00:15:07,377
Eat, eat.

307
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:08,736
You eat, you eat.

308
00:15:08,897 --> 00:15:09,616
Eat, eat, eat.

309
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:10,377
Eat, eat, eat.

310
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:10,977
Come on.

311
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,137
Delicious, delicious.

312
00:15:13,897 --> 00:15:14,696
How is it?

313
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:15,498
Not bad.

314
00:15:15,498 --> 00:15:16,777
This expired stuff is delicious.

315
00:15:16,777 --> 00:15:17,057
No.

316
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:18,057
Instant noodles has to be

317
00:15:18,057 --> 00:15:18,538
made right.

318
00:15:18,538 --> 00:15:19,816
We'll die together!

319
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:25,137
Come.

320
00:15:25,137 --> 00:15:26,297
Say goodbye.

321
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:27,336
Goodbye, Grandpa.

322
00:15:27,336 --> 00:15:29,216
Goodbye, Grandpa. Goodbye, Grandma.

323
00:15:29,297 --> 00:15:30,298
Xiaomi,

324
00:15:30,298 --> 00:15:31,657
see me often.

325
00:15:31,657 --> 00:15:32,137
Got it.

326
00:15:32,137 --> 00:15:32,816
Okay.

327
00:15:32,936 --> 00:15:33,936
Quickly go back and rest.

328
00:15:33,936 --> 00:15:34,936
Rest well.

329
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:36,497
Be careful.

330
00:15:36,497 --> 00:15:37,497
Watch your step.

331
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:39,417
Dami.

332
00:15:43,257 --> 00:15:44,257
After going home,

333
00:15:44,537 --> 00:15:46,017
do you know how to talk to your mom?

334
00:15:46,297 --> 00:15:47,297
Don't complain.

335
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,337
But that...

336
00:15:48,337 --> 00:15:49,417
No buts.

337
00:15:50,177 --> 00:15:51,178
When I went to school,

338
00:15:51,178 --> 00:15:52,736
did you dump me?

339
00:15:53,897 --> 00:15:55,177
Let's call it even.

340
00:15:55,576 --> 00:15:56,377
Alright.

341
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:57,696
I believe you.

342
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:04,377
Dad, Dami, hurry up.

343
00:16:05,017 --> 00:16:06,017
Let's go.

344
00:16:19,096 --> 00:16:20,096
Your mom is coming.

345
00:16:23,257 --> 00:16:24,257
Come.

346
00:16:24,576 --> 00:16:26,336
- Mom, I miss you.
- Mom.

347
00:16:26,816 --> 00:16:28,377
Kids, I miss you too.

348
00:16:28,736 --> 00:16:30,057
Was today happy?

349
00:16:30,377 --> 00:16:32,417
Yeah, I'm so happy.

350
00:16:33,497 --> 00:16:34,696
Dami, aren't you happy?

351
00:16:39,816 --> 00:16:40,816
Are you happy?

352
00:16:40,976 --> 00:16:41,778
Yeah,

353
00:16:41,778 --> 00:16:42,816
very happy.

354
00:16:46,897 --> 00:16:48,696
These are

355
00:16:48,696 --> 00:16:49,897
from my parents for the kids.

356
00:16:50,537 --> 00:16:52,257
My mom is really happy today.

357
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:54,057
I'm also really grateful to you.

358
00:16:54,057 --> 00:16:54,697
You also know,

359
00:16:54,697 --> 00:16:55,736
my mom's health condition

360
00:16:55,736 --> 00:16:57,057
is getting worse day by day.

361
00:16:57,497 --> 00:16:58,576
I might often

362
00:16:58,576 --> 00:17:00,216
bring them over to accompany her.

363
00:17:00,297 --> 00:17:01,856
As long as you follow the agreement

364
00:17:01,944 --> 00:17:03,777
and don't take the kids
away arbitrarily,

365
00:17:03,777 --> 00:17:04,896
I can understand.

366
00:17:05,537 --> 00:17:06,176
I know.

367
00:17:06,176 --> 00:17:07,176
Let's go.

368
00:17:09,217 --> 00:17:10,376
Safe journey.

369
00:17:55,136 --> 00:17:56,376
300,000.

370
00:18:03,896 --> 00:18:05,616
Spend money to avoid disaster.

371
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:07,816
Spend money to avoid disaster.

372
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:34,176
What are you doing?

373
00:18:34,176 --> 00:18:35,336
Your sister is calling you.

374
00:18:35,937 --> 00:18:37,136
Countdown,

375
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,416
one week left.

376
00:18:39,176 --> 00:18:41,896
Xiaojiao and Qian Hao
should get divorced.

377
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:45,816
They are getting divorced.

378
00:18:45,816 --> 00:18:47,257
Why are you so excited?

379
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:48,416
After they get divorced,

380
00:18:48,697 --> 00:18:49,896
my sister will take Xiaojiao

381
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:51,336
to go back abroad.

382
00:18:51,336 --> 00:18:52,896
We will be liberated.

383
00:18:55,136 --> 00:18:56,257
Liberated.

384
00:19:00,497 --> 00:19:01,937
Heaven and earth,

385
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,416
all the deities,

386
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,096
bless Hu Xiaojiao and Qian Hao

387
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:06,737
for a smooth divorce.

388
00:19:07,257 --> 00:19:08,537
Definitely.

389
00:19:38,576 --> 00:19:40,217
Master, Master.

390
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,656
This is your disciple.

391
00:19:42,937 --> 00:19:44,136
When exactly will you

392
00:19:44,136 --> 00:19:45,416
come back?

393
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:55,816
(Hi, Youyou.)

394
00:19:56,457 --> 00:19:57,297
Master,

395
00:19:57,297 --> 00:19:58,856
you finally show up.

396
00:19:59,497 --> 00:20:00,298
Master,

397
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:02,257
is it reasonable
to be missing for so long?

398
00:20:02,257 --> 00:20:03,416
I am alone every day now

399
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,656
and very busy with work.

400
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:05,498
Yiersan misses you

401
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:06,537
so much.

402
00:20:06,537 --> 00:20:07,457
It lies on the place

403
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:08,457
where you play solo.

404
00:20:08,656 --> 00:20:10,096
Hurry back.

405
00:20:28,777 --> 00:20:29,977
Wake up, wake up.

406
00:20:29,977 --> 00:20:31,136
What time is it?

407
00:20:33,576 --> 00:20:35,616
Look at this mess.

408
00:20:49,096 --> 00:20:50,096
Wake up.

409
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,417
How did you turn

410
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:02,737
fine days into this?

411
00:21:19,217 --> 00:21:20,457
Good question.

412
00:21:23,457 --> 00:21:25,257
How did it become like this?

413
00:21:40,017 --> 00:21:41,017
Xiaojiao.

414
00:21:41,737 --> 00:21:42,737
Are you going out?

415
00:21:43,217 --> 00:21:44,537
Yes, I have something to do.

416
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:46,337
Yes,

417
00:21:46,337 --> 00:21:47,937
going out and getting some sun

418
00:21:47,937 --> 00:21:48,458
is good

419
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:49,777
for your health.

420
00:21:49,777 --> 00:21:50,937
But there's one thing.

421
00:21:51,017 --> 00:21:51,937
Don't meet Qian Hao.

422
00:21:51,937 --> 00:21:52,816
Don't.

423
00:21:52,816 --> 00:21:53,497
That's right.

424
00:21:53,497 --> 00:21:54,497
Yes, yes, yes.

425
00:21:54,856 --> 00:21:56,017
Qian Hao is such a scumbag.

426
00:21:56,017 --> 00:21:57,136
Don't meet him.

427
00:21:57,497 --> 00:21:59,176
Even if a knife was held to my throat,

428
00:21:59,176 --> 00:22:00,616
I wouldn't look back.

429
00:22:01,057 --> 00:22:02,977
I'm going to meet with Xu Kaixin.

430
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:05,136
Some things weighing on my mind.

431
00:22:05,136 --> 00:22:06,136
If unresolved,

432
00:22:06,497 --> 00:22:07,977
I can't completely let go.

433
00:22:08,656 --> 00:22:10,217
Rivals lock eyes,

434
00:22:10,217 --> 00:22:11,457
hatred flares.

435
00:22:11,457 --> 00:22:12,697
What if a fight breaks out?

436
00:22:13,096 --> 00:22:14,336
With your puny build...

437
00:22:15,977 --> 00:22:17,257
I'll go with you.

438
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:18,816
Yes, we'll go together.

439
00:22:18,816 --> 00:22:19,816
It won't happen.

440
00:22:20,017 --> 00:22:22,257
Kaixin is living happily now.

441
00:22:23,017 --> 00:22:23,698
I owe her

442
00:22:23,698 --> 00:22:25,057
a sincere apology.

443
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:28,136
Maybe she feels it's not needed anymore.

444
00:22:28,136 --> 00:22:29,136
But

445
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:30,616
I need it.

446
00:22:32,737 --> 00:22:33,737
See you later.

447
00:23:05,977 --> 00:23:07,176
Eating so blandly?

448
00:23:08,057 --> 00:23:09,737
You can't live without
someone serving you.

449
00:23:10,257 --> 00:23:11,697
Who are you acting pitiful for?

450
00:23:12,856 --> 00:23:13,577
Anything

451
00:23:13,577 --> 00:23:14,977
is fine to eat.

452
00:23:15,376 --> 00:23:16,457
Don't waste it.

453
00:23:17,217 --> 00:23:19,017
Order whatever you want to eat yourself.

454
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,816
Then what will my mom eat?

455
00:23:23,297 --> 00:23:24,097
She's sleeping

456
00:23:24,097 --> 00:23:25,697
till now as you.

457
00:23:26,257 --> 00:23:27,537
I don't know when she'll get up.

458
00:23:28,257 --> 00:23:29,336
Let's talk about it later.

459
00:23:35,768 --> 00:23:37,156
(Management Office)

460
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:50,217
(I am not Hu Pei.)

461
00:23:52,816 --> 00:23:54,856
Master, stop fooling around.

462
00:23:54,856 --> 00:23:56,497
You're such a grown person.

463
00:23:56,697 --> 00:23:58,217
Alright, now you

464
00:23:58,217 --> 00:23:59,977
just want to use up
all your annual leave

465
00:24:00,217 --> 00:24:01,218
and exhaust me,

466
00:24:01,218 --> 00:24:02,497
and then you'll be happy, right?

467
00:24:11,656 --> 00:24:12,656
(Sorry.)

468
00:24:13,096 --> 00:24:14,537
(Hu Pei has passed away.)

469
00:24:15,176 --> 00:24:16,336
(He had no family.)

470
00:24:17,057 --> 00:24:18,777
(He left a will.)

471
00:24:19,217 --> 00:24:20,816
(He left all his belongings to me.)

472
00:24:21,737 --> 00:24:23,017
(After handling his affairs)

473
00:24:23,176 --> 00:24:24,497
(and finishing with lawyers,)

474
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:26,416
(I charged and turned on his phone)

475
00:24:26,416 --> 00:24:27,616
(and saw your message.)

476
00:24:28,497 --> 00:24:29,616
(Hu Pei left some money)

477
00:24:29,616 --> 00:24:30,616
(to Yiersan.)

478
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,136
(If possible,)

479
00:24:32,217 --> 00:24:33,896
(he hoped to entrust it to you.)

480
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:43,816
Master,

481
00:24:44,616 --> 00:24:46,977
there should be a limit to joking.

482
00:24:47,697 --> 00:24:49,217
I'm really going to get angry.

483
00:25:00,312 --> 00:25:02,520
(Medical Certificate
of Cause of Death, Hu Pei)

484
00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:12,856
(Death due to unsuccessful
heart disease resuscitation)

485
00:25:44,952 --> 00:25:47,020
(Cemetery Name: Yongshou Cemetery)

486
00:25:50,096 --> 00:25:51,176
Yongshou Cemetery.

487
00:25:53,217 --> 00:25:54,257
Yongshou Cemetery.

488
00:25:54,497 --> 00:25:56,136
Yongshou Cemetery.

489
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,416
Little Youyou,

490
00:27:09,537 --> 00:27:10,537
long time no see.

491
00:27:11,416 --> 00:27:13,217
I knew you would come back.

492
00:27:13,856 --> 00:27:15,176
You can't leave here.

493
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,335
(Tomb of Hu Pei)

494
00:27:41,017 --> 00:27:42,017
Calabash Brothers.

495
00:27:42,697 --> 00:27:43,697
Calabash Brothers.

496
00:27:45,777 --> 00:27:46,937
Civilized tomb sweeping.

497
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:48,856
If it were me,

498
00:27:48,856 --> 00:27:50,416
I would just put Calabash Brothers.

499
00:27:50,537 --> 00:27:52,176
It's lively and festive.

500
00:27:52,176 --> 00:27:52,896
Think about it.

501
00:27:52,977 --> 00:27:54,937
A circle of bodyguards
around my tombstone,

502
00:27:54,937 --> 00:27:56,297
how impressive.

503
00:27:56,537 --> 00:27:57,336
Chinese people

504
00:27:57,336 --> 00:27:58,137
have our own

505
00:27:58,137 --> 00:27:59,217
Chinese heroes.

506
00:27:59,217 --> 00:28:00,217
Right?

507
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:08,416
You.

508
00:28:35,376 --> 00:28:37,017
Hello, are you Youyou?

509
00:29:01,136 --> 00:29:02,416
Dami, play with me.

510
00:29:10,057 --> 00:29:10,816
Stop!

511
00:29:11,017 --> 00:29:12,017
Don't bothering me!

512
00:29:14,856 --> 00:29:16,376
Bad Dami, bad Dami.

513
00:29:16,376 --> 00:29:17,737
I don't like you,

514
00:29:17,737 --> 00:29:18,616
a bad sister.

515
00:29:18,616 --> 00:29:19,457
I don't like you,

516
00:29:19,457 --> 00:29:20,457
a bad brother.

517
00:29:20,656 --> 00:29:21,977
You two, stop playing.

518
00:29:23,096 --> 00:29:23,778
Pack up things.

519
00:29:23,778 --> 00:29:25,136
Let's go to grandma's house later.

520
00:29:25,136 --> 00:29:25,816
I am not going.

521
00:29:25,816 --> 00:29:26,656
I have a pile

522
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,656
of homework to do.

523
00:29:28,336 --> 00:29:29,218
Then you can follow

524
00:29:29,218 --> 00:29:30,537
me and Lili to the store.

525
00:29:30,537 --> 00:29:30,897
Okay.

526
00:29:30,897 --> 00:29:32,416
I'll take the homework to the store.

527
00:29:33,297 --> 00:29:34,336
No, wait a minute.

528
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,137
Didn't you say

529
00:29:35,137 --> 00:29:36,576
you have a good time at Grandma's?

530
00:29:36,576 --> 00:29:37,377
Yes, it's good.

531
00:29:37,377 --> 00:29:38,977
I haven't finished my homework.

532
00:29:39,336 --> 00:29:40,176
Alright.

533
00:29:40,176 --> 00:29:41,537
I'll make you something delicious.

534
00:29:41,537 --> 00:29:42,537
Okay.

535
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,057
Xiaomi, hurry up.

536
00:29:44,376 --> 00:29:45,096
Okay, I'll cook.

537
00:29:45,096 --> 00:29:46,017
Let's eat together.

538
00:29:46,017 --> 00:29:46,457
Alright.

539
00:29:46,457 --> 00:29:47,176
Alright.

540
00:29:47,257 --> 00:29:48,017
Bad sister.

541
00:29:48,017 --> 00:29:49,017
Bad sister.

542
00:29:51,737 --> 00:29:52,737
Listen.

543
00:29:52,856 --> 00:29:53,697
Bad sister.

544
00:29:53,697 --> 00:29:54,697
Bad sister.

545
00:29:57,816 --> 00:29:59,336
Bad sister, bad sister.

546
00:29:59,336 --> 00:30:00,457
Bad sister.

547
00:30:02,576 --> 00:30:03,656
Bad sister.

548
00:30:03,737 --> 00:30:05,217
Annoying sister.

549
00:30:07,977 --> 00:30:10,816
Bad sister, bad sister.

550
00:30:10,816 --> 00:30:14,297
Bad sister.

551
00:30:20,497 --> 00:30:21,498
Little fat boy.

552
00:30:21,498 --> 00:30:22,977
This candy is very sweet.

553
00:30:22,977 --> 00:30:24,217
You'll feel better.

554
00:30:24,217 --> 00:30:25,217
It's for you.

555
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:36,816
Thank you.

556
00:30:46,856 --> 00:30:47,856
You traitor.

557
00:30:48,217 --> 00:30:48,857
Return it to me.

558
00:30:48,857 --> 00:30:49,896
Return it to him.

559
00:30:50,017 --> 00:30:50,938
Return it to him.

560
00:30:50,938 --> 00:30:52,096
Don't bully him.

561
00:30:52,297 --> 00:30:53,297
Return it to him.

562
00:30:53,896 --> 00:30:55,057
Return it to him.

563
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:56,497
Return it to him.

564
00:30:56,497 --> 00:30:57,217
Return it to him.

565
00:30:57,217 --> 00:30:57,656
No.

566
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:58,656
Yu'an, Yule.

567
00:30:58,937 --> 00:30:59,697
What's wrong?

568
00:30:59,697 --> 00:31:00,297
Give it to me.

569
00:31:00,297 --> 00:31:00,977
What's wrong?

570
00:31:00,977 --> 00:31:01,376
What?

571
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,376
What are you doing?

572
00:31:02,457 --> 00:31:03,457
What's wrong, Xiaomi?

573
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:05,697
What's wrong?

574
00:31:06,017 --> 00:31:08,017
Dami took my candy.

575
00:31:28,856 --> 00:31:30,096
You're right.

576
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:32,457
If the four of them live together,

577
00:31:33,257 --> 00:31:35,497
the house will be a mess.

578
00:31:35,497 --> 00:31:37,336
We'll become peacekeeping police.

579
00:31:37,336 --> 00:31:38,656
Not to mention four,

580
00:31:38,896 --> 00:31:39,977
my two children

581
00:31:39,977 --> 00:31:41,777
can fight 800 times a day.

582
00:31:44,297 --> 00:31:45,616
Yeah, in a while,

583
00:31:45,616 --> 00:31:47,057
I'll take Yu'an and Yule

584
00:31:47,057 --> 00:31:48,096
to class.

585
00:31:48,096 --> 00:31:49,697
After class, they go to grandma's house.

586
00:31:49,816 --> 00:31:50,657
After that,

587
00:31:50,657 --> 00:31:52,096
I'll go to the shop to help.

588
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,018
Forget it.

589
00:31:53,018 --> 00:31:54,416
Hurry back to rest.

590
00:31:55,017 --> 00:31:56,856
Don't drag everyone down.

591
00:31:56,937 --> 00:31:58,697
We are each other's gas stations,

592
00:31:58,697 --> 00:31:59,737
not a burden.

593
00:32:01,297 --> 00:32:01,938
Alright.

594
00:32:01,938 --> 00:32:03,257
I'll see how things go then.

595
00:32:08,057 --> 00:32:08,777
Is there

596
00:32:08,777 --> 00:32:09,698
something

597
00:32:09,698 --> 00:32:10,777
bothering you recently?

598
00:32:11,737 --> 00:32:12,737
About work?

599
00:32:14,176 --> 00:32:15,176
Nothing can escape

600
00:32:15,176 --> 00:32:16,176
your eyes.

601
00:32:17,697 --> 00:32:18,816
Of course.

602
00:32:19,136 --> 00:32:20,416
Why not

603
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:21,856
quit this job?

604
00:32:22,017 --> 00:32:23,777
Join me in running the cake shop.

605
00:32:23,777 --> 00:32:24,097
Perhaps,

606
00:32:24,097 --> 00:32:25,816
we might succeed in starting
a big chain.

607
00:32:25,816 --> 00:32:27,176
Perhaps it will even go public.

608
00:32:28,737 --> 00:32:29,977
Alright, don't worry.

609
00:32:30,257 --> 00:32:32,136
I'm just being pretentious here.

610
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:35,136
This old company

611
00:32:35,457 --> 00:32:36,896
gave me a raise and promotion.

612
00:32:37,176 --> 00:32:38,816
But there's a bit of a grudge with it.

613
00:32:38,977 --> 00:32:40,217
As for the new company,

614
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,937
I can't bring these old colleagues.

615
00:32:43,576 --> 00:32:45,057
So I'm torn here for a while.

616
00:32:46,896 --> 00:32:48,416
Since this choice

617
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:49,376
is very hard to make,

618
00:32:49,376 --> 00:32:50,258
it proves that

619
00:32:50,258 --> 00:32:51,816
they are just tomayto-tomahto.

620
00:32:51,896 --> 00:32:52,977
Then it's simple.

621
00:32:52,977 --> 00:32:54,336
Choose the more beneficial one.

622
00:32:54,937 --> 00:32:55,817
You must not listen to

623
00:32:55,817 --> 00:32:57,616
those capitalists' sugar-coated words.

624
00:32:57,816 --> 00:32:58,778
What's in hand

625
00:32:58,778 --> 00:33:00,176
is the real thing.

626
00:33:00,737 --> 00:33:02,416
You're truly realistic.

627
00:33:03,297 --> 00:33:04,497
But it makes sense.

628
00:33:09,257 --> 00:33:10,257
Gas Station,

629
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,537
I'm about to go to work.

630
00:33:12,656 --> 00:33:13,937
Shouldn't you

631
00:33:14,017 --> 00:33:15,737
give me some motivation, cheer me up?

632
00:33:23,136 --> 00:33:24,136
What about me?

633
00:33:30,457 --> 00:33:31,218
You have much

634
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:32,297
gray hair.

635
00:33:32,297 --> 00:33:33,457
Too much gray hair.

636
00:33:33,457 --> 00:33:35,616
Sister, what are they doing?

637
00:33:35,616 --> 00:33:37,176
Don't dye it, I'll pull it out for you.

638
00:33:37,937 --> 00:33:39,416
Mr. Mei wants Mom to kiss him.

639
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:41,912
But Mom didn't kiss him.
She pulled out a strand of his hair.

640
00:33:41,912 --> 00:33:42,856
Is there more?

641
00:33:43,457 --> 00:33:44,217
More than one.

642
00:33:44,217 --> 00:33:45,136
You need to dye it.

643
00:33:45,136 --> 00:33:45,978
This won't do.

644
00:33:45,978 --> 00:33:47,096
I saw it.

645
00:33:47,336 --> 00:33:48,058
Ms. Xu pulled out

646
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:49,777
a black hair from dad.

647
00:33:50,136 --> 00:33:51,217
Especially black.

648
00:33:51,737 --> 00:33:53,217
It's not gray hair at all.

649
00:33:54,017 --> 00:33:55,217
Ms. Xu lied.

650
00:33:56,257 --> 00:33:57,977
Why?

651
00:33:59,856 --> 00:34:01,057
Alright, alright.

652
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:02,497
Alright.

653
00:34:04,816 --> 00:34:06,176
What are you two doing here?

654
00:34:06,977 --> 00:34:07,616
Hurry back.

655
00:34:07,616 --> 00:34:08,457
What are you doing?

656
00:34:08,457 --> 00:34:09,457
Finished packing up?

657
00:34:09,817 --> 00:34:10,817
Go back quickly, hurry.

658
00:34:11,576 --> 00:34:12,576
Go back.

659
00:34:12,656 --> 00:34:13,817
Get ready for class.

660
00:34:30,616 --> 00:34:31,736
- Dad, Dad.
- Dad, Dad.

661
00:34:31,817 --> 00:34:34,417
- Hurry up, we'll be late.
- We'll be late.

662
00:34:34,977 --> 00:34:35,897
It's still early.

663
00:34:35,897 --> 00:34:36,897
What's the rush?

664
00:34:37,497 --> 00:34:39,096
Are you really afraid of being late?

665
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:41,937
Or do you want to find Dami and Xiaomi

666
00:34:41,937 --> 00:34:42,937
to argue?

667
00:34:44,696 --> 00:34:45,977
Or you want to play with them?

668
00:34:46,136 --> 00:34:47,176
- No.
- No.

669
00:34:47,656 --> 00:34:48,696
Then who

670
00:34:48,937 --> 00:34:50,696
just gave a lollipop to Xiaomi?

671
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:53,136
She did.

672
00:34:53,136 --> 00:34:53,736
She did.

673
00:34:53,736 --> 00:34:54,417
She did.

674
00:34:54,417 --> 00:34:55,216
She did.

675
00:34:55,216 --> 00:34:56,216
She did.

676
00:34:57,057 --> 00:34:58,497
A child who can express kindness

677
00:34:58,497 --> 00:34:59,576
is the best.

678
00:34:59,857 --> 00:35:00,537
Who did?

679
00:35:00,537 --> 00:35:01,136
I did.

680
00:35:01,136 --> 00:35:02,136
I did.

681
00:35:03,256 --> 00:35:04,576
Alright, take your things and go.

682
00:35:07,017 --> 00:35:08,017
Dad, let's go.

683
00:35:08,377 --> 00:35:09,377
Hurry up.

684
00:35:09,457 --> 00:35:10,616
Wait. I put on shoes.

685
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:11,818
Dad, let's go.

686
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,977
Dad, let's hurry up.

687
00:35:13,136 --> 00:35:14,457
Coming, coming, coming.

688
00:35:15,296 --> 00:35:16,977
How outrageous he is.

689
00:35:17,457 --> 00:35:19,017
It's been almost twenty years.

690
00:35:19,216 --> 00:35:20,417
We never contacted each other.

691
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:21,857
Unexpectedly, he left a will

692
00:35:22,256 --> 00:35:23,857
and asked me to handle this.

693
00:35:24,337 --> 00:35:26,488
He left so much inheritance
to me, his ex-girlfriend.

694
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:30,656
He really lived
his whole life recklessly

695
00:35:31,256 --> 00:35:32,616
and made a mess his whole life.

696
00:35:33,696 --> 00:35:34,857
(Until I met her,)

697
00:35:35,497 --> 00:35:36,537
(I finally understood)

698
00:35:37,377 --> 00:35:38,656
that love

699
00:35:40,017 --> 00:35:41,776
is not that ordinary.

700
00:35:42,977 --> 00:35:44,096
If she really stands

701
00:35:44,096 --> 00:35:45,096
in front of you

702
00:35:45,497 --> 00:35:46,576
and gives you a smile,

703
00:35:48,377 --> 00:35:49,137
you would

704
00:35:49,137 --> 00:35:50,696
want to give her the whole world.

705
00:35:53,377 --> 00:35:54,776
I heard him mention you.

706
00:35:55,576 --> 00:35:58,776
He said there
was someone he deeply loved.

707
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,057
Just because in the crowd,

708
00:36:01,057 --> 00:36:02,417
he glanced at her one more time,

709
00:36:03,776 --> 00:36:05,656
he wanted to give her the whole world.

710
00:36:09,736 --> 00:36:10,537
When

711
00:36:10,656 --> 00:36:12,136
he resolutely proposed to break up,

712
00:36:12,136 --> 00:36:13,457
he didn't say like this.

713
00:36:15,736 --> 00:36:16,977
I threatened to commit suicide

714
00:36:16,977 --> 00:36:18,057
and he didn't relent.

715
00:36:18,656 --> 00:36:20,256
He even found a woman to annoy me

716
00:36:20,256 --> 00:36:21,296
and make me give up.

717
00:36:23,656 --> 00:36:25,537
I thought he was joking.

for my good,

721
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:39,937
afraid of dragging me down.

722
00:36:42,736 --> 00:36:44,057
But I still resent him.

723
00:36:45,417 --> 00:36:47,497

why did

my master suddenly...?

728
00:37:07,857 --> 00:37:10,017
This is what he left for you.

729
00:37:10,176 --> 00:37:11,776
The lawyer transferred it to me.

730
00:37:12,216 --> 00:37:12,938
After reading it,

731
00:37:12,938 --> 00:37:14,017
you would know.

732
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,497
There is also a card inside.

733
00:37:16,497 --> 00:37:17,497
It's

left for Yiersan's living expenses.

00:37:19,776 --> 00:37:20,776
I'm afraid of dogs.

736
00:37:21,736 --> 00:37:22,817
When he was with me,

737
00:37:22,817 --> 00:37:23,817
he wanted to have one.

738
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:26,616
He eventually got one.

739
00:37:37,736 --> 00:37:40,176
(Little Youyou,
I hope this letter finds you well.)

740

742
00:37:46,377 --> 00:37:47,776
(already gone to heaven.)

743
00:37:48,656 --> 00:37:50,377
(You didn't expect that, did you?)

744
00:37:50,897 --> 00:37:54,337
(I am actually the hidden major client,)

745
00:37:54,977 --> 00:37:57,136
(occupying the best spot)

746
00:37:57,497 --> 00:37:59,337
(for a long time now.)

747
00:38:02,216 --> 00:38:03,977
(Don't be sad, little girl.)

748
00:38:04,497 --> 00:38:05,418
(Actually,)

749
00:38:05,418 --> 00:38:07,136
(I have already gained a lot.)

750
00:38:07,656 --> 00:38:08,817
(There is a hereditary issue)

751
00:38:08,817 --> 00:38:09,897
(in my family.)

752
00:38:10,337 --> 00:38:12,296

00:38:23,296 --> 00:38:25,616
(I've been on a countdown to death.)

760
00:38:25,616 --> 00:38:26,616
Let's get acquainted.

761
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,096
(To be precise,)

762
00:38:28,656 --> 00:38:30,136
(everyone is on a countdown.)

763
00:38:30,576 --> 00:38:32,457
(It's just that my race)

764
00:38:32,817 --> 00:38:34,296

00:38:34,576 --> 00:38:35,656
(to be)

766
00:38:35,857 --> 00:38:37,377
(half as long as others.)

767
00:38:38,136 --> 00:38:39,480
This is called a joyous funeral.

768
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:40,577
Later,

769
00:38:40,577 --> 00:38:41,857
they will set off firecrackers.

770
00:38:43,057 --> 00:38:44,176
But he died.

771
00:38:44,176 --> 00:38:45,537
What's there to be happy about?

772
00:38:46,776 --> 00:38:48,176
Nobody wants to get old.

773
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,857
But do you know

774
00:38:50,057 --> 00:38:51,136
many people

775
00:38:51,736 --> 00:38:53,057
never live to be old at all?

776
00:38:53,576 --> 00:38:55,616
(I am already forty-four now.)

777
00:38:55,857 --> 00:38:57,457
(Every extra day lived)

778
00:38:57,457 --> 00:38:58,776
(is a bonus.)

779
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:02,017
(You came to the cemetery
to heal your heart,)

780
00:39:02,537 --> 00:39:03,977
(so did I.)

781
00:39:04,857 --> 00:39:07,176
(I fear death more than anyone else.)

782
00:39:08,457 --> 00:39:10,457
(Every day working in the cemetery)

783
00:39:11,096 --> 00:39:12,897
(is to get used to)

784
00:39:12,897 --> 00:39:14,696
(this future forever home in advance.)

785
00:39:16,096 --> 00:39:17,897
(I have to brag a little about this.)

786
00:39:18,256 --> 00:39:19,377
(This home)

787
00:39:19,377 --> 00:39:21,136
(is well maintained by me, isn't it?)

788
00:39:23,017 --> 00:39:24,017
(Sometimes,)

789
00:39:24,616 --> 00:39:26,296
(when I sit in front of my own grave,)

790
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:28,568
(looking into the distant
green mountains)

791
00:39:28,857 --> 00:39:29,857
(I felt)

792
00:39:30,136 --> 00:39:32,057
(living here for many lifetimes)

793
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:33,576
(seems not too bad.)

794
00:39:35,296 --> 00:39:37,377
(This should be the home I like.)

795
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:40,457
(The neighbors all know me.)

796
00:39:40,937 --> 00:39:42,096
(So, little girl,)

797
00:39:42,576 --> 00:39:43,616
(don't worry.)

798
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:47,176
(I must be happy now.)

799
00:39:48,977 --> 00:39:49,977
(I don't know)

800
00:39:50,417 --> 00:39:52,417
(if you will return to the cemetery.)

801
00:39:53,296 --> 00:39:55,817
(I think you should follow your heart.)

802
00:39:56,536 --> 00:39:57,857
(Maybe the knot in your heart)

803
00:39:57,857 --> 00:39:59,136
(has already been unraveled.)

804
00:39:59,256 --> 00:40:02,576
(Then you will be able to do
whatever you want to.)

805
00:40:03,656 --> 00:40:04,736
(That would be wonderful.)

806
00:40:05,656 --> 00:40:06,538
(I am not worried)

807
00:40:06,538 --> 00:40:08,537
(that you will never return.)

808
00:40:09,136 --> 00:40:10,497
(When you come)

809
00:40:10,656 --> 00:40:12,136
(to see your sister here,)

810
00:40:12,937 --> 00:40:15,457
(bring some skewers)

811
00:40:15,817 --> 00:40:17,057
(and a little liquor for me.)

812
00:40:17,337 --> 00:40:18,377
(That will make)

813
00:40:18,377 --> 00:40:19,776
(our bond worth it.)

814
00:40:22,817 --> 00:40:24,296
(The only thing I'm worried about)

815
00:40:24,656 --> 00:40:25,656
(is Yiersan.)

816
00:40:26,176 --> 00:40:28,216
(This silly dog is too nostalgic.)

817
00:40:28,817 --> 00:40:30,616
(So please)

818
00:40:31,136 --> 00:40:32,497
(take good care of Yiersan.)

819
00:40:33,136 --> 00:40:34,817
(I have kept aside)

820
00:40:34,817 --> 00:40:35,977
(the cost of its upbringing.)

821
00:40:36,656 --> 00:40:37,937
(If you do not agree,)

822
00:40:38,017 --> 00:40:39,897
(I will not forgive you
even in the afterlife.)

823
00:40:41,776 --> 00:40:42,817
(Alright, little girl,)

824
00:40:43,057 --> 00:40:44,057
(don't be sad.)

825
00:40:44,937 --> 00:40:46,296
(A pretty common saying)

826
00:40:46,576 --> 00:40:48,136
(really hits me.)

827
00:40:49,696 --> 00:40:52,576
(Since we will be dead for a long time,)

828
00:40:53,216 --> 00:40:56,017
(we should live better.)

829
00:40:58,417 --> 00:41:01,256
(I'm going to die now.)

830
00:41:01,857 --> 00:41:05,417
(But you should live well
for your sister)

831
00:41:05,497 --> 00:41:06,616
(and me.)

832
00:41:06,736 --> 00:41:10,176
Don't waste time.
Enjoy life while you can.

833
00:41:16,216 --> 00:41:18,457
Smell this, how fragrant it is.

834
00:41:20,457 --> 00:41:22,057
Consider the heat control.

835
00:41:22,216 --> 00:41:23,616
Youyou, hurry up.

836
00:41:24,096 --> 00:41:26,176
Help me. I got blocked again.

837
00:41:27,457 --> 00:41:28,457
How is it, Youyou?

838
00:41:28,656 --> 00:41:31,256
My skill is improving, right?

839
00:41:31,817 --> 00:41:32,817
Ghost!

840
00:41:33,296 --> 00:41:34,776
Master, Master, it's me.

841
00:41:36,312 --> 00:41:41,377
♪Gradually forget how to breathe♪

842
00:41:41,377 --> 00:41:42,937
Do you want to scare me to death?

843
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,257
No, it's so late.

844
00:41:44,257 --> 00:41:45,537
Why are you here?

845
00:41:47,576 --> 00:41:48,817
I'm telling you.

846
00:41:49,216 --> 00:41:50,296
You should know

847
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:52,176
the life

848
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:54,337
passes by quickly.

849
00:41:54,537 --> 00:41:56,216
You need to know how to enjoy

850
00:41:56,497 --> 00:41:57,817
and take care of yourself.

851
00:41:57,977 --> 00:41:58,977
Master,

852
00:41:59,497 --> 00:42:00,616
how old are you?

853
00:42:00,937 --> 00:42:01,937
Over 40?

854
00:42:02,616 --> 00:42:04,017
Why do you act so old-fashioned,

855
00:42:04,017 --> 00:42:05,736
like an old man?

856
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:07,457
This is

857
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:09,576
Tai Chi?

858
00:42:09,776 --> 00:42:11,616
The lack of culture is truly terrifying.

859
00:42:12,537 --> 00:42:14,377
This is called "Ba Duan Jin".

860
00:42:14,696 --> 00:42:16,057
It's for strengthening the body,

861
00:42:16,977 --> 00:42:18,017
and replenishing Qi.

862
00:42:18,616 --> 00:42:20,136
(Goodbye, little girl.)

863
00:42:20,537 --> 00:42:21,912
(Everything remains unchanged.)

864
00:42:22,096 --> 00:42:24,337
(We'll meet again in a hundred years.)

865
00:42:24,537 --> 00:42:25,616
(Do you believe it?)

866
00:42:25,616 --> 00:42:27,057
(I will still be that)

867
00:42:27,057 --> 00:42:29,136
(most handsome youth.)

868
00:42:30,576 --> 00:42:31,776
(At the very end,)

869
00:42:32,057 --> 00:42:33,857
(I will tell you a joke.)

870
00:42:33,976 --> 00:42:34,898
(For half a lifetime,)

871
00:42:34,898 --> 00:42:36,656
(I relied on it to trick little girls.)

872
00:42:36,937 --> 00:42:38,696
(Guess why there are)

873
00:42:38,696 --> 00:42:40,377
(only six Calabash Brothers on display?)

874
00:42:40,937 --> 00:42:42,136
(Can't guess, right?)

875
00:42:42,576 --> 00:42:44,736
(Because the Sixth Brother
possesses invisibility.)

876
00:42:44,897 --> 00:42:46,017
(He became invisible.)
