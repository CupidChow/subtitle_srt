Dad.

17

Dad.

18
00:01:46,103 --> 00:01:48,183
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:48,263 --> 00:01:49,224
- This is...
- Dad.

20
00:01:49,304 --> 00:01:50,983
The gift you bought is amazing.

21
00:01:51,343 --> 00:01:53,463
You're my super dad.

22
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,344
Dad,

23
00:01:54,424 --> 00:01:56,623
you are the best dad in the world.

24
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:57,743
I love you.

25
00:02:00,144 --> 00:02:00,864
Okay.

26
00:02:00,944 --> 00:02:03,064
Shall I help you do it?

27
00:02:03,424 --> 00:02:04,263
Come on, let's go.

28
00:02:05,343 --> 00:02:06,743
(This feeling is only known)

29
00:02:06,823 --> 00:02:08,264
(to those who become a parent,)

30
00:02:08,623 --> 00:02:09,743
(constantly being drained,)

31
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,864
(yet constantly being healed.)

32
00:02:12,544 --> 00:02:14,864
(They are both our weakness and armor.)

33
00:02:15,743 --> 00:02:16,983
(Whether the gifts)

34
00:02:17,063 --> 00:02:18,544
(are expensive or not,)

35
00:02:18,743 --> 00:02:19,864
(in their eyes,)

36
00:02:20,024 --> 00:02:21,544
(they are always the best.)

37
00:02:22,903 --> 00:02:24,384
(A day that originally went badly)

38
00:02:24,704 --> 00:02:26,383
(has turned into a happy one)

39
00:02:26,463 --> 00:02:28,104
(because of this double hug.)

40
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:30,264
(Even if the road ahead is stormy,)

41
00:02:30,824 --> 00:02:33,104
(I will not and cannot be defeated,)

42
00:02:33,463 --> 00:02:34,383
(because I am)

43
00:02:34,463 --> 00:02:35,463
(their super dad.)

44
00:03:03,623 --> 00:03:04,623
You fell asleep?

45
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,264
You really fell asleep!

46
00:03:15,424 --> 00:03:16,544
What are you doing?

47
00:03:20,384 --> 00:03:22,343
Mei Chengyi has a girlfriend now.

48
00:03:22,943 --> 00:03:24,063
Yu'an and Yule

49
00:03:24,384 --> 00:03:25,783
will have a stepmother.

50
00:03:26,343 --> 00:03:28,343
They'll no longer be that close to us.

51
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:29,743
And your little daughter...

52
00:03:32,024 --> 00:03:34,463
She had boyfriends during school days.

53
00:03:35,183 --> 00:03:36,823
Now it's time for marriage.

54
00:03:36,903 --> 00:03:38,543
But she believes in being single.

55
00:03:38,623 --> 00:03:40,024
She wants to enjoy a single life,

56
00:03:40,104 --> 00:03:40,864
and not marry.

57
00:03:42,943 --> 00:03:44,624
Obviously, these two being together

58
00:03:44,704 --> 00:03:46,783
is a win-win-win situation!

59
00:03:47,183 --> 00:03:49,103
But neither of them listens.

60
00:03:49,183 --> 00:03:50,063
What should we do?

61
00:03:51,743 --> 00:03:53,783
The eldest has been gone
for several years now.

62
00:03:54,144 --> 00:03:56,144
Chengyi is still young.

63
00:03:56,783 --> 00:03:58,063
He'll definitely remarry.

64
00:03:59,623 --> 00:04:01,663
Some stuff is just going to happen
no matter what,

65
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,144
and it's not up to us.

66
00:04:04,183 --> 00:04:05,384
Unless they break up.

67
00:04:05,783 --> 00:04:08,264
There's no chance with Youyou.

68
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,864
What did you say?

69
00:04:13,343 --> 00:04:14,223
No chance.

70
00:04:14,424 --> 00:04:16,423
No, before this.

71
00:04:17,944 --> 00:04:19,223
Unless they break up.

72
00:04:19,624 --> 00:04:22,184
There's no chance with Youyou.

73
00:04:24,184 --> 00:04:25,144
Oh right,

74
00:04:27,423 --> 00:04:29,384
they can break up.

75
00:04:32,543 --> 00:04:34,263
I didn't expect

76
00:04:34,343 --> 00:04:35,223
you could come up with

77
00:04:35,303 --> 00:04:36,824
such a clever plan.

78
00:04:38,983 --> 00:04:39,624
Going to sleep.

79
00:04:40,944 --> 00:04:42,343
What's that supposed to mean?

80
00:04:46,983 --> 00:04:47,824
Break up.

81
00:04:53,343 --> 00:04:54,863
I've got some news.

82
00:04:55,783 --> 00:04:56,583
Whose news is it?

83
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:57,824
Qian Hao's, of course.

84
00:04:58,463 --> 00:05:00,223
You even have such connections?

85
00:05:00,423 --> 00:05:01,384
Wait a moment.

86
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:03,624
Come on, come on.

87
00:05:04,064 --> 00:05:05,064
Have some snacks first.

88
00:05:05,144 --> 00:05:05,944
Foodie girl.

89
00:05:07,064 --> 00:05:07,863
What happened?

90
00:05:08,384 --> 00:05:10,664
Hu Xiaojiao's been preparing
for pregnancy for three years

91
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,024
and still hasn't conceived.

92
00:05:13,103 --> 00:05:15,663
Qian Hao's mom says every day

93
00:05:15,863 --> 00:05:18,103
the family doesn't even have a child.

94
00:05:18,223 --> 00:05:20,744
She even says how fertile

95
00:05:20,824 --> 00:05:21,984
you are.

96
00:05:22,064 --> 00:05:22,984
You have a son

97
00:05:23,064 --> 00:05:24,423
and a girl.

98
00:05:26,343 --> 00:05:28,824
His mom is truly something.

99
00:05:28,944 --> 00:05:30,864
Even a goddess may not

100
00:05:30,944 --> 00:05:32,143
match her son.

101
00:05:32,223 --> 00:05:32,823
Back then,

102
00:05:32,903 --> 00:05:34,143
when he was with Hu Xiaojiao,

103
00:05:34,223 --> 00:05:35,704
do you know what she said about me?

104
00:05:35,863 --> 00:05:37,744
She said I wasn't

105
00:05:37,824 --> 00:05:38,703
charming enough,

106
00:05:38,783 --> 00:05:40,184
that's why her son cheated.

107
00:05:41,223 --> 00:05:42,983
She is sick.

108
00:05:43,103 --> 00:05:44,584
It's said she has cancer,

109
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:46,223
and doesn't have long to live.

110
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:49,504
So I'm thinking,

111
00:05:50,144 --> 00:05:51,104
Qian Hao surely

112
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,863
came back because of this.

113
00:05:53,064 --> 00:05:55,103
Hu Xiaojiao can't have children.

114
00:05:55,184 --> 00:05:56,343
His mom always feels

115
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,463
their family's throne

116
00:05:57,543 --> 00:05:58,783
needs someone to inherit it.

117
00:05:58,863 --> 00:05:59,984
So he set his mind

118
00:06:00,064 --> 00:06:01,463
on you.

119
00:06:02,064 --> 00:06:03,303
Although Qian Hao is bad,

120
00:06:04,223 --> 00:06:05,184
he is truly filial

121
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:06,264
to his mother.

122
00:06:08,184 --> 00:06:09,264
Did your heart soften?

123
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:11,944
Your heart softened, right?

124
00:06:12,024 --> 00:06:13,103
Not me, no way.

125
00:06:14,863 --> 00:06:16,024
I just thought

126
00:06:17,064 --> 00:06:20,223
his mom is sick.

127
00:06:29,103 --> 00:06:32,184
Mom, pee.

128
00:06:33,624 --> 00:06:34,463
Do you remember

129
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:36,184
the year Dami had a fever

130
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:38,423
and was suspected of having leukemia?

131
00:06:39,504 --> 00:06:40,824
I came out of the hospital

132
00:06:41,103 --> 00:06:42,584
and tried to raise money.

133
00:06:42,824 --> 00:06:44,744
I couldn't reach Qian Hao by phone.

134
00:06:44,824 --> 00:06:45,383
Both he

135
00:06:45,463 --> 00:06:46,624
and Xiaojiao blocked me.

136
00:06:46,983 --> 00:06:48,783
At that time, they both were abroad,

137
00:06:49,024 --> 00:06:50,504
and I couldn't

138
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:51,584
find anyone.

139
00:06:52,543 --> 00:06:53,863
I really had no choice.

140
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:55,423
I went to find his mom.

141
00:06:56,024 --> 00:06:57,024
As a result,

142
00:06:57,504 --> 00:06:59,104
she just threw a thousand at me

143
00:06:59,184 --> 00:07:00,663
and drove me away.

144
00:07:02,144 --> 00:07:05,184
I remember it was the eighth day
of the Lunar New Year,

145
00:07:05,783 --> 00:07:08,184
and the streets
were full of festivities.

146
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,863
I alone was just like in a daze,

147
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:13,423
walking aimlessly.

148
00:07:13,624 --> 00:07:14,863
I ended up by the river,

149
00:07:15,744 --> 00:07:18,223
standing by the river, I thought,

150
00:07:18,744 --> 00:07:20,504
I, Xu Kaixin, am a pretty good woman,

151
00:07:20,584 --> 00:07:22,744
how did I end up like this today?

152
00:07:23,303 --> 00:07:24,463
If I died,

153
00:07:24,624 --> 00:07:26,423
wouldn't Qian Hao
have to take care of them,

154
00:07:26,584 --> 00:07:27,983
and then Dami would be saved.

155
00:07:28,543 --> 00:07:29,824
I lost my mind,

156
00:07:30,103 --> 00:07:31,543
and I jumped.

157
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:37,264
The river water was really cold,

158
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:39,584
and it instantly woke me up.

159
00:07:39,944 --> 00:07:41,423
How could I be kind-hearted

160
00:07:41,824 --> 00:07:43,384
to Qian Hao and his family?

161
00:07:43,783 --> 00:07:44,544
If I'm gone,

162
00:07:44,624 --> 00:07:46,184
what will happen to my kids,

163
00:07:46,343 --> 00:07:47,463
and Lili?

164
00:07:47,903 --> 00:07:48,744
I'm not afraid

165
00:07:48,824 --> 00:07:50,184
of anything, not even death.

166
00:07:54,584 --> 00:07:56,223
Fortunately, Dami is fine.

167
00:07:57,184 --> 00:07:58,824
You are also fine.

168
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:02,343
So how could I be soft-hearted?

169
00:08:02,944 --> 00:08:04,304
If they want to see the kids,

170
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:05,744
pay the alimony on time.

171
00:08:05,824 --> 00:08:06,863
I won't stop them.

172
00:08:07,744 --> 00:08:08,624
If they have any other

173
00:08:08,704 --> 00:08:09,703
tricks up their sleeve.

174
00:08:09,783 --> 00:08:11,584
We won't back down or endure it.

175
00:08:11,704 --> 00:08:13,504
If he has any more tricks,

176
00:08:13,584 --> 00:08:14,263
I'll kick

177
00:08:14,343 --> 00:08:15,624
him out first.

178
00:08:16,824 --> 00:08:17,624
Mom.

179
00:08:18,504 --> 00:08:19,303
Xiaomi.

180
00:08:19,944 --> 00:08:20,903
Xiaomi, what's up?

181
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:21,544
Qian Xiaomi,

182
00:08:21,624 --> 00:08:22,384
why not sleep?

183
00:08:22,903 --> 00:08:24,223
Xiaomi, what's wrong?

184
00:08:25,024 --> 00:08:26,384
Why did you wet yourself?

185
00:08:27,343 --> 00:08:27,944
Quick, quick!

186
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:28,744
Go to the toilet!

187
00:08:28,824 --> 00:08:29,744
Come on, quickly!

188
00:08:51,504 --> 00:08:53,984
Look at this.

189
00:08:55,384 --> 00:08:56,943
Mine is almost turning to mush.

190
00:09:19,384 --> 00:09:20,464
What's going on here?

191
00:09:28,303 --> 00:09:31,624
Dad, the eggs are broken.

192
00:09:33,624 --> 00:09:35,224
Oh, you two.

193
00:09:37,224 --> 00:09:39,063
Dad, I'm sorry.

194
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:41,783
I just wanted to make you breakfast.

195
00:09:43,864 --> 00:09:44,424
Alright.

196
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:45,424
Quick, go take a bath.

197
00:09:45,504 --> 00:09:46,144
Go.

198
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:47,144
I'm sorry.

199
00:09:47,224 --> 00:09:47,864
Quickly!

200
00:09:48,624 --> 00:09:49,423
Oh!

201
00:09:55,024 --> 00:09:56,144
You two, stop playing.

202
00:09:56,224 --> 00:09:57,543
I've put the clothes at the door.

203
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:00,264
You two, hurry up.

204
00:10:00,344 --> 00:10:01,264
There's no time.

205
00:10:01,624 --> 00:10:02,544
Okay, just about done.

206
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:04,183
Almost.

207
00:10:11,543 --> 00:10:12,864
Go back to sleep for a while.

208
00:10:13,783 --> 00:10:14,943
I would not dare.

209
00:10:15,104 --> 00:10:16,343
If I miss taking the kids,

210
00:10:16,423 --> 00:10:18,024
you'll dock my pay again.

211
00:10:20,423 --> 00:10:21,583
Don't take them today.

212
00:10:27,903 --> 00:10:28,703
Why?

213
00:10:29,624 --> 00:10:31,024
Why ask that?

214
00:10:32,104 --> 00:10:33,343
I'm not happy.

215
00:10:33,423 --> 00:10:34,224
Okay?

216
00:10:36,823 --> 00:10:38,504
You old man.

217
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:40,943
Why not take the kids?

218
00:10:43,183 --> 00:10:45,224
I need to be more resolute.

219
00:10:45,543 --> 00:10:47,344
I want to let Mei Chengyi know.

220
00:10:47,504 --> 00:10:49,343
If we hadn't helped all these years,

221
00:10:49,423 --> 00:10:50,823
he couldn't manage his life well.

222
00:10:51,344 --> 00:10:52,783
He needs to weigh it out.

223
00:10:53,024 --> 00:10:55,223
If he really dares to

224
00:10:55,303 --> 00:10:56,423
marry another one

225
00:10:56,783 --> 00:10:57,904
and we let him go,

226
00:10:57,984 --> 00:10:59,744
I wonder if he can hold on or not.

227
00:11:00,303 --> 00:11:02,024
Just making pointless trouble.

228
00:11:02,104 --> 00:11:03,744
Dad, you are confused.

229
00:11:03,903 --> 00:11:06,663
Things won't develop as you wish.

230
00:11:07,423 --> 00:11:08,583
If you don't want to sleep,

231
00:11:08,663 --> 00:11:09,744
come out and do some work.

232
00:11:14,344 --> 00:11:15,463
I'm not done eating yet.

233
00:11:15,543 --> 00:11:16,944
Always looking for trouble.

234
00:11:17,024 --> 00:11:17,984
And you still eat?

235
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:20,783
I'll serve you some more.

236
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,583
Alright, eat.

237
00:11:36,104 --> 00:11:36,903
Eat.

238
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:02,103
Today,

239
00:12:02,183 --> 00:12:03,823
why are you guys so quiet?

240
00:12:19,823 --> 00:12:21,663
Family don't hold grudges overnight.

241
00:12:21,744 --> 00:12:22,343
She has been

242
00:12:22,423 --> 00:12:24,024
tying shoelaces for over a minute.

243
00:12:24,384 --> 00:12:25,783
She's waiting for you.

244
00:12:31,464 --> 00:12:32,264
Time to go.

245
00:12:39,144 --> 00:12:40,024
Hurry up and go.

246
00:12:43,823 --> 00:12:45,904
Boy, eat quickly.

247
00:12:45,984 --> 00:12:47,864
After eating,
we need to go to kindergarten.

248
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:49,423
Let's go.

249
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:50,264
Right now?

250
00:12:50,344 --> 00:12:51,343
You haven't finished yet.

251
00:12:51,423 --> 00:12:52,144
Eat quickly.

252
00:12:52,384 --> 00:12:53,344
Have a few more bites.

253
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,024
This is weird.

254
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,583
They're almost late.

255
00:13:01,663 --> 00:13:03,303
Why not leave yet?

256
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,864
Sit still for a while.

257
00:13:09,344 --> 00:13:10,024
Going like this

258
00:13:10,104 --> 00:13:11,623
makes me dizzy.

259
00:13:11,703 --> 00:13:12,823
If you don't have expertise,

260
00:13:12,903 --> 00:13:14,264
don't take on that tricky task.

261
00:13:14,744 --> 00:13:15,784
Are you troubling him,

262
00:13:15,864 --> 00:13:17,183
or us?

263
00:13:19,504 --> 00:13:21,424
Small impatience spoils great plans.

264
00:13:21,504 --> 00:13:22,423
You know that?

265
00:13:22,744 --> 00:13:24,224
This is great wisdom.

266
00:13:24,543 --> 00:13:25,624
How do you know?

267
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:28,423
Idiot.

268
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:29,583
I don't bother with you.

269
00:14:17,663 --> 00:14:18,464
Mom.

270
00:14:18,744 --> 00:14:19,943
Don't talk. The wind's strong.

271
00:14:29,384 --> 00:14:29,944
Your aunt

272
00:14:30,024 --> 00:14:31,343
will pick you up soon.

273
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,463
No time to eat.

274
00:14:32,543 --> 00:14:33,703
I will give you some money

275
00:14:33,783 --> 00:14:35,384
to buy some food at the snack shop.

276
00:14:36,063 --> 00:14:37,144
- Okay.
- Okay.

277
00:14:40,024 --> 00:14:40,984
Were you

278
00:14:41,224 --> 00:14:42,744
making breakfast for me?

279
00:14:44,224 --> 00:14:46,224
I want to make omelets for you.

280
00:14:47,823 --> 00:14:49,024
You're still young.

281
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:51,024
Making a mess of the kitchen

282
00:14:51,104 --> 00:14:52,464
would tire me even more.

283
00:14:54,384 --> 00:14:56,744
- Dad.
- Sorry.

284
00:14:58,104 --> 00:14:58,903
Alright.

285
00:14:59,024 --> 00:15:01,223
Next time, I will teach you.

286
00:15:01,303 --> 00:15:02,583
Let's do it together, okay?

287
00:15:02,783 --> 00:15:04,144
- Thank you, Dad.
- Thank you, Dad.

288
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,424
Okay, quickly.

289
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:06,624
Get ready, let's go.

290
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,623
(Chengyi, my dad made a foolish move.)

291
00:15:15,703 --> 00:15:17,343
(He doesn't let me
pick up kids anymore.)

292
00:15:17,423 --> 00:15:18,424
(He wants you)

293
00:15:18,504 --> 00:15:19,503
(not to leave)

294
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:20,744
(and remain his son-in-law.)

295
00:15:20,864 --> 00:15:22,504
(Chengyi, hang in there.)

296
00:15:22,624 --> 00:15:24,464
(Never bow to villains.)

297
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:31,903
Wait, wait, wait.

298
00:15:32,423 --> 00:15:34,024
Hurry up, we're going to be late.

299
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,623
Get off, we're late. Hurry.

300
00:15:35,703 --> 00:15:36,503
Hurry up, Yule.

301
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:37,343
Yu'an, Yule.

302
00:15:37,423 --> 00:15:38,503
Wait, the backpacks.

303
00:15:38,583 --> 00:15:39,303
Hurry up.

304
00:15:43,823 --> 00:15:44,543
Thank you.

305
00:15:54,984 --> 00:15:56,024
Mei Chengyi.

306
00:15:56,543 --> 00:15:57,344
You're fired.

307
00:16:14,024 --> 00:16:14,703
Quickly, go pack.

308
00:16:14,783 --> 00:16:15,384
It's late.

309
00:16:17,224 --> 00:16:18,903
- Is Aunt not coming?
- No, she's not.

310
00:16:21,744 --> 00:16:22,864
Let's go, go, go.

311
00:16:23,783 --> 00:16:24,823
Yu'an, go get the shoes.

312
00:16:24,903 --> 00:16:25,464
Okay.

313
00:16:34,423 --> 00:16:35,663
Who is that person?

314
00:16:36,783 --> 00:16:38,144
Honey, honey.

315
00:16:38,344 --> 00:16:38,863
Over here.

316
00:16:38,943 --> 00:16:39,664
What's wrong?

317
00:16:39,744 --> 00:16:41,024
What happened?

318
00:16:41,104 --> 00:16:42,103
Look, look.

319
00:16:42,183 --> 00:16:43,184
Isn't the one

320
00:16:43,264 --> 00:16:43,944
who got the kids

321
00:16:44,024 --> 00:16:45,344
in the car Chengyi?

322
00:16:45,783 --> 00:16:47,024
You didn't go pick them up.

323
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:48,423
It must be Chengyi.

324
00:16:52,984 --> 00:16:53,583
No, it's not.

325
00:16:53,783 --> 00:16:54,783
It's really not Chengyi.

326
00:16:55,128 --> 00:16:56,312
- Who is it?
- Where is he?

327
00:16:57,024 --> 00:16:58,024
- Youyou,
- Wait.

328
00:16:58,024 --> 00:16:58,983
quick, call the police!

329
00:16:59,063 --> 00:16:59,703
Youyou.

330
00:16:59,783 --> 00:17:00,424
What's wrong?

331
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:01,743
What's up again?

332
00:17:01,823 --> 00:17:02,703
Hurry, hurry.

333
00:17:02,783 --> 00:17:03,544
Call...

334
00:17:03,624 --> 00:17:04,743
Call the police!

335
00:17:04,823 --> 00:17:05,664
What's wrong?

336
00:17:05,783 --> 00:17:07,144
Right, make the call!

337
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:08,464
Yu'an and Yule

338
00:17:08,744 --> 00:17:09,944
were abducted.

339
00:17:10,303 --> 00:17:10,944
Quickly!

340
00:17:11,024 --> 00:17:12,463
I... I'll call Chengyi!

341
00:17:12,543 --> 00:17:13,623
I'll call Chengyi!

342
00:17:16,184 --> 00:17:17,823
Chengyi, where are Yu'an and Yule?

343
00:17:21,143 --> 00:17:23,503
You found someone

344
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,223
to send them

345
00:17:24,303 --> 00:17:25,464
to school?

346
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:26,944
Okay, okay, okay.

347
00:17:27,904 --> 00:17:28,904
Nothing.

348
00:17:28,984 --> 00:17:30,224
Mom and Dad were scared.

349
00:17:30,744 --> 00:17:31,424
It's okay now.

350
00:17:31,704 --> 00:17:32,424
Alright.

351
00:17:32,583 --> 00:17:33,303
What's wrong?

352
00:17:33,504 --> 00:17:34,464
What's going on?

353
00:17:34,823 --> 00:17:36,063
Chengyi has something at work

354
00:17:36,143 --> 00:17:37,023
and can't be late.

355
00:17:37,103 --> 00:17:38,344
You wouldn't send the kids,

356
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:38,983
so he

357
00:17:39,063 --> 00:17:40,223
found someone

358
00:17:40,303 --> 00:17:41,944
to send them to school.

359
00:17:42,024 --> 00:17:42,624
The teacher

360
00:17:42,704 --> 00:17:44,224
will meet them there.

361
00:17:45,224 --> 00:17:46,464
Chengyi is quite smart.

362
00:17:47,744 --> 00:17:49,223
This is too outrageous.

363
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:50,303
How could he hand them

364
00:17:50,383 --> 00:17:51,463
over to outsiders?

365
00:17:51,543 --> 00:17:53,063
You aren't helping today.

366
00:17:53,143 --> 00:17:54,783
He can only seek help from outsiders.

367
00:17:55,543 --> 00:17:56,944
It's just you are messing around.

368
00:17:57,143 --> 00:17:57,904
If Yu'an and Yule

369
00:17:57,984 --> 00:17:58,904
encounter any trouble,

370
00:17:58,984 --> 00:18:00,424
I'll divorce you.

371
00:18:01,224 --> 00:18:01,944
Alright, alright.

372
00:18:02,024 --> 00:18:02,624
No way.

373
00:18:02,704 --> 00:18:04,263
I still can't be at ease.

374
00:18:04,343 --> 00:18:05,383
I need to go there.

375
00:18:05,543 --> 00:18:06,343
Come on.

376
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:24,824
Mom,

377
00:18:24,904 --> 00:18:26,104
can I take my brother

378
00:18:26,184 --> 00:18:28,143
to have a meal with Dad?

379
00:18:30,704 --> 00:18:31,504
Qian Dami,

380
00:18:32,103 --> 00:18:32,703
have

381
00:18:32,783 --> 00:18:34,063
Qian Hao come talk to me.

382
00:18:36,143 --> 00:18:36,944
Other parents

383
00:18:37,024 --> 00:18:38,263
never speak ill of each other

384
00:18:38,343 --> 00:18:39,223
in front of the child.

385
00:18:39,303 --> 00:18:40,503
How could you be like this?

386
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:41,463
Why should I

387
00:18:41,543 --> 00:18:42,223
suffer and toil,

388
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,904
and still

389
00:18:42,984 --> 00:18:44,024
praise him?

390
00:18:44,184 --> 00:18:45,703
Can't you just get along?

391
00:18:45,783 --> 00:18:47,223
Do you have to antagonize him?

392
00:18:47,303 --> 00:18:48,184
He knows best

393
00:18:48,264 --> 00:18:49,023
what he has done.

394
00:18:49,103 --> 00:18:50,023
Stop talking about it.

395
00:18:50,103 --> 00:18:51,184
You are still young.

396
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,823
Let life educate you.

397
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:57,744
Want to stay at your dad's
for a few days?

398
00:18:58,024 --> 00:18:59,623
- Yes.
- Go ahead.

399
00:18:59,823 --> 00:19:00,623
Really?

400
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:01,623
Really.

401
00:19:01,904 --> 00:19:03,383
Stay as many days as you want.

402
00:19:03,744 --> 00:19:05,704
Thank you, Mom. You are the best.

403
00:19:06,424 --> 00:19:07,224
Goodbye.

404
00:19:08,744 --> 00:19:09,424
Good morning.

405
00:19:09,823 --> 00:19:11,224
- Hello.
- Good morning.

406
00:19:12,024 --> 00:19:12,743
Hello.

407
00:19:12,823 --> 00:19:13,984
Morning. Take it slow.

408
00:19:27,143 --> 00:19:27,863
Thank you.

409
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:35,704
- Morning.
- Yeah.

410
00:19:57,303 --> 00:19:58,103
You're here.

411
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:00,383
What are you doing?

412
00:20:08,383 --> 00:20:09,184
Pretty close.

413
00:20:20,744 --> 00:20:21,984
I can't be late again.

414
00:20:40,024 --> 00:20:40,823
(Mei Chengyi)
Hello.

415
00:20:40,944 --> 00:20:41,824
I just paid

416
00:20:41,904 --> 00:20:43,343
the membership fee yesterday.

417
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:45,184
It was too late yesterday.

418
00:20:45,424 --> 00:20:46,783
I'll briefly say something.

419
00:20:46,863 --> 00:20:48,664
My requirements for my other half

420
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,383
are kindness, a love for children,
and being family-oriented.

421
00:21:00,623 --> 00:21:01,503
That's all.

422
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:02,263
See if there's

423
00:21:02,343 --> 00:21:03,424
a suitable lady.

424
00:21:03,823 --> 00:21:04,863
Okay, thank you.

425
00:21:09,984 --> 00:21:11,783
Love for children,
and being family-oriented.

426
00:21:12,424 --> 00:21:13,823
This punk

427
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,583
just wants to be a playboy.

428
00:21:16,783 --> 00:21:17,863
Drop the act.

429
00:21:23,184 --> 00:21:24,143
Xu Kaixin.

430
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:25,944
(A Second Chance)
Why did you have to tell me?

431
00:21:26,024 --> 00:21:26,863
Compensate me.

432
00:21:27,143 --> 00:21:27,864
I thought

433
00:21:27,944 --> 00:21:30,143
I could earn a report bonus.

434
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:31,624
Last night,

435
00:21:31,704 --> 00:21:32,864
I collected

436
00:21:32,944 --> 00:21:34,063
a membership fee.

437
00:21:34,143 --> 00:21:35,703
Thought I finally met a handsome guy.

438
00:21:35,783 --> 00:21:37,024
I had to save it for you.

439
00:21:37,143 --> 00:21:38,424
Turns out to be a player.

440
00:21:38,543 --> 00:21:39,783
How much is the membership fee?

441
00:21:39,944 --> 00:21:41,143
3,600.

442
00:21:45,264 --> 00:21:46,703
What if this is a misunderstanding?

443
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:47,344
Should we

444
00:21:47,424 --> 00:21:48,783
give the membership fee a chance?

445
00:21:49,904 --> 00:21:51,063
Never believe

446
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,983
a punk's words.

447
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:54,104
He'd make himself sound

448
00:21:54,184 --> 00:21:55,424
like the most wronged person.

449
00:22:00,343 --> 00:22:02,383
How about you act as a decoy for me,

450
00:22:02,744 --> 00:22:05,583
and have a polite blind date with him?

451
00:22:07,264 --> 00:22:07,864
I can't send

452
00:22:07,944 --> 00:22:08,983
other girls to go, right?

453
00:22:09,063 --> 00:22:09,664
Miss Li,

454
00:22:09,744 --> 00:22:11,583
don't you have a conscience?

455
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,184
Why not?

456
00:22:13,303 --> 00:22:14,703
First, you won't be fooled.

457
00:22:14,783 --> 00:22:15,384
Second,

458
00:22:15,464 --> 00:22:16,664
you can enjoy a free meal.

459
00:22:16,744 --> 00:22:18,263
Anyway, I won't refund the money.

460
00:22:18,343 --> 00:22:19,584
No thanks.

461
00:22:19,664 --> 00:22:20,703
Listen to me,

462
00:22:20,783 --> 00:22:21,424
for a scumbag

463
00:22:21,504 --> 00:22:23,463
who brings condoms

464
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:24,944
and lingerie on a business trip

465
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,223
and comes to our agency

466
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,223
to look for a partner,

467
00:22:27,303 --> 00:22:27,983
don't we

468
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:29,543
have the responsibility

469
00:22:29,623 --> 00:22:30,984
to join forces

470
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:32,103
and act chivalrously?

471
00:22:33,063 --> 00:22:34,104
Master Li,

472
00:22:34,184 --> 00:22:35,503
you go and be chivalrous.

473
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:36,584
I, the ordinary person,

474
00:22:36,664 --> 00:22:37,624
have to work seriously

475
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:38,664
to support two kids.

476
00:22:38,744 --> 00:22:39,424
Bye bye.

477
00:22:39,504 --> 00:22:40,583
No, Xu Kaixin.

478
00:22:40,823 --> 00:22:42,823
Okay.

479
00:22:43,783 --> 00:22:45,143
We can earn money together.

480
00:22:46,264 --> 00:22:47,063
How much?

481
00:22:47,264 --> 00:22:48,944
Wiring you 600 now.

482
00:22:49,224 --> 00:22:49,904
Got it.

483
00:22:49,984 --> 00:22:51,664
Tell me, when will I meet him?

484
00:22:52,264 --> 00:22:53,224
No more waits.

485
00:22:53,583 --> 00:22:54,464
Tonight then.

486
00:22:55,984 --> 00:22:56,823
Wait a moment.

487
00:22:57,184 --> 00:22:58,343
Have you two met before?

488
00:22:58,744 --> 00:22:59,983
I was wearing a mask.

489
00:23:00,063 --> 00:23:00,864
Don't worry.

490
00:23:00,944 --> 00:23:02,383
Even my dad won't recognize me.

491
00:23:02,623 --> 00:23:03,984
Great, sister.

492
00:23:04,184 --> 00:23:05,024
Counting on you.

493
00:23:05,583 --> 00:23:06,383
Just wait.

494
00:23:06,543 --> 00:23:07,343
Bye bye.

495
00:23:07,704 --> 00:23:08,504
Bye bye.

496
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:18,968
(A Second Chance)

497
00:23:53,664 --> 00:23:54,463
I'm here now.

498
00:23:54,543 --> 00:23:55,344
Why the rush?

499
00:23:55,424 --> 00:23:56,343
Seriously.

500
00:23:57,904 --> 00:23:58,704
You're back.

501
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:00,383
You bought quite a lot.

502
00:24:00,543 --> 00:24:01,383
Yes.

503
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,063
Wasn't talking to you.

504
00:24:03,143 --> 00:24:05,024
Qian's son and daughter-in-law
next door.

505
00:24:05,224 --> 00:24:05,864
It's her.

506
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:06,743
Didn't I tell you?

507
00:24:06,823 --> 00:24:08,424
She was his mistress.

508
00:24:08,504 --> 00:24:09,624
But she can't have children.

509
00:24:09,704 --> 00:24:11,424
Qian is crazy about grandkids.

510
00:24:11,504 --> 00:24:12,664
This is karma.

511
00:24:12,744 --> 00:24:14,103
Serves them right, it truly does.

512
00:24:14,623 --> 00:24:16,783
Did you hear that? I deserve it.

513
00:24:17,343 --> 00:24:18,263
Nonsense.

514
00:24:18,343 --> 00:24:19,103
Ignore her.

515
00:24:19,184 --> 00:24:19,783
Nonsense?

516
00:24:19,863 --> 00:24:21,184
See how your mom

517
00:24:21,264 --> 00:24:22,543
talks about me.

518
00:24:22,664 --> 00:24:23,344
She's just

519
00:24:23,424 --> 00:24:24,104
a gossip.

520
00:24:24,184 --> 00:24:24,864
Why bother?

521
00:24:24,944 --> 00:24:26,823
- Let's go.
- Why wouldn't she talk about you?

522
00:24:26,944 --> 00:24:28,144
You're the one who's impotent

523
00:24:28,224 --> 00:24:29,184
owing to an accident.

524
00:24:29,264 --> 00:24:31,184
Shut up, what are you talking about?

525
00:24:31,823 --> 00:24:32,463
Qian Hao.

526
00:24:32,543 --> 00:24:34,823
It's fine to talk about me
but not about you?

527
00:24:35,103 --> 00:24:35,904
You let your mom

528
00:24:35,984 --> 00:24:37,063
throw dirt on me.

529
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,904
You just want me
to take the fall for you.

530
00:24:38,984 --> 00:24:39,584
No.

531
00:24:39,664 --> 00:24:41,424
- It's not like that.
- Don't treat me like

532
00:24:41,504 --> 00:24:42,744
you did with Xu Kaixin.

533
00:24:42,944 --> 00:24:43,463
Alright.

534
00:24:43,543 --> 00:24:44,063
Stop here.

535
00:24:44,143 --> 00:24:45,704
Let's go home.

536
00:24:45,944 --> 00:24:46,743
No more talking.

537
00:24:46,823 --> 00:24:47,623
Let go.

538
00:24:48,664 --> 00:24:49,984
Let's go home.

539
00:24:50,383 --> 00:24:51,063
Let's go.

540
00:24:51,143 --> 00:24:52,823
Let's go, go.

541
00:24:53,184 --> 00:24:53,744
Come on.

542
00:24:58,184 --> 00:24:58,984
Mom.

543
00:25:03,303 --> 00:25:04,103
Where is she?

544
00:25:05,744 --> 00:25:06,664
Gone out?

545
00:25:07,744 --> 00:25:08,543
Mom.

546
00:25:17,383 --> 00:25:18,303
Went to buy groceries.

547
00:25:27,343 --> 00:25:28,704
Here we go again.

548
00:25:33,303 --> 00:25:33,904
Alright.

549
00:25:33,984 --> 00:25:35,664
I raised my voice at you.

550
00:25:35,904 --> 00:25:36,743
I scared you.

551
00:25:36,823 --> 00:25:37,863
You can hit me.

552
00:25:37,984 --> 00:25:39,583
Hit me, hit me, hit me.

553
00:25:43,264 --> 00:25:44,264
Alright, alright.

554
00:25:44,823 --> 00:25:46,384
I didn't mean to wrong you.

555
00:25:46,464 --> 00:25:48,184
Nor did I mean
to make you take the blame.

556
00:25:49,103 --> 00:25:50,263
About my mom's health,

557
00:25:50,343 --> 00:25:52,383
you know.

558
00:25:52,543 --> 00:25:54,224
But how she talks about me outside.

559
00:25:55,464 --> 00:25:56,184
That's enough.

560
00:25:56,264 --> 00:25:57,743
Her biggest wish

561
00:25:57,823 --> 00:25:59,184
is to have a grandchild.

562
00:25:59,343 --> 00:26:00,223
If she finds out about

563
00:26:00,303 --> 00:26:01,184
my current state,

564
00:26:01,264 --> 00:26:03,344
she would get sick from anxiety,

565
00:26:03,424 --> 00:26:05,024
making her illness more serious.

566
00:26:06,424 --> 00:26:07,224
Just endure it.

567
00:26:07,664 --> 00:26:08,543
If you're upset,

568
00:26:08,623 --> 00:26:09,824
I'll be more uneasy.

569
00:26:09,904 --> 00:26:10,664
Really.

570
00:26:14,543 --> 00:26:15,504
Stop.

571
00:26:16,823 --> 00:26:17,743
Okay, smile.

572
00:26:17,823 --> 00:26:19,024
Get up, get up.

573
00:26:21,704 --> 00:26:23,424
I know you're aggrieved.

574
00:26:23,704 --> 00:26:24,703
Wait for me to be better.

575
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:25,344
It will

576
00:26:25,424 --> 00:26:26,543
get better.

577
00:26:26,664 --> 00:26:27,543
You keep your word?

578
00:26:27,623 --> 00:26:28,303
I will, I will.

579
00:26:28,383 --> 00:26:29,184
Sure, I will.

580
00:26:31,823 --> 00:26:33,063
You bad boy.

581
00:26:33,143 --> 00:26:33,743
Alright.

582
00:26:33,823 --> 00:26:35,063
Don't be angry.

583
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:44,248
(Live Broadcast Data)

584
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:53,823
Hello, Dad.

585
00:26:53,944 --> 00:26:55,023
Chengyi, let me tell you.

586
00:26:55,103 --> 00:26:56,144
From now on, never ever

587
00:26:56,224 --> 00:26:57,063
let outsiders

588
00:26:57,143 --> 00:26:58,223
pick up the girls.

589
00:26:58,303 --> 00:26:59,063
Got it?

590
00:26:59,383 --> 00:27:00,424
This is too dangerous.

591
00:27:01,024 --> 00:27:02,103
Too dangerous.

592
00:27:03,264 --> 00:27:03,944
No, Dad.

593
00:27:04,024 --> 00:27:05,424
I really have something to do

594
00:27:05,504 --> 00:27:06,223
and can't be late.

595
00:27:06,303 --> 00:27:08,344
- That's why I...
- If you have things to handle,

596
00:27:08,424 --> 00:27:09,424
deal with them.

597
00:27:09,944 --> 00:27:10,944
Leave the kids

598
00:27:11,024 --> 00:27:11,664
to us.

599
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,744
You don't have to worry.

600
00:27:14,063 --> 00:27:15,184
Today is the same.

601
00:27:15,704 --> 00:27:16,624
Have them stay here

602
00:27:16,704 --> 00:27:18,103
and have dinner.

603
00:27:19,464 --> 00:27:20,264
Okay.

604
00:27:33,984 --> 00:27:35,263
(Impressive, Chengyi!)

605
00:27:35,343 --> 00:27:37,424
(Pulled a fast one on my dad.)

606
00:27:41,744 --> 00:27:42,543
Slow down.

607
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:47,984
Seems like this trick won't work.

608
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,424
Hurt the foe and ourselves.

609
00:27:50,583 --> 00:27:51,424
Big loss.

610
00:27:52,264 --> 00:27:53,904
I need to think of another plan.

611
00:27:56,944 --> 00:27:58,143
Forget it.

612
00:27:58,264 --> 00:27:59,984
Stop looking for trouble.

613
00:28:00,103 --> 00:28:01,904
You didn't pick up the kids

614
00:28:02,224 --> 00:28:03,864
and wanted Chengyi to know

615
00:28:03,944 --> 00:28:05,343
he can't do without us.

616
00:28:05,664 --> 00:28:08,143
When he resolved it himself,

617
00:28:08,863 --> 00:28:10,023
you panicked

618
00:28:10,103 --> 00:28:11,543
and rushed up,

619
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:12,664
chasing after their car

620
00:28:12,744 --> 00:28:14,103
to send the kids to school.

621
00:28:15,623 --> 00:28:16,744
And you twisted your ankle.

622
00:28:17,823 --> 00:28:19,063
How does the saying go?

623
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:21,024
Man plans,

624
00:28:21,264 --> 00:28:22,583
God laughs.

625
00:28:23,823 --> 00:28:25,823
It's fools like you that make Him laugh.

626
00:28:26,904 --> 00:28:28,143
What do you know?

627
00:28:29,143 --> 00:28:31,224
I'm the only sensible person
in this family.

628
00:28:31,383 --> 00:28:32,104
Without me,

629
00:28:32,184 --> 00:28:33,984
I wonder how you two would get by.

630
00:28:38,424 --> 00:28:40,543
The kids are out of the question.

631
00:28:42,343 --> 00:28:44,583
I'll have to deal with
the stepmother first.

632
00:28:45,744 --> 00:28:46,984
What are you up to again?

633
00:28:49,543 --> 00:28:50,944
Make God laugh at me.

634
00:28:55,944 --> 00:28:57,503
Next up is our team's

635
00:28:57,583 --> 00:28:58,983
(Live stream data analysis)
data analysis of these three

636
00:28:59,063 --> 00:28:59,984
live-streamers.

637
00:29:00,664 --> 00:29:02,383
Alright, let's first take a look at

638
00:29:02,504 --> 00:29:03,704
Zhou Jingyi's live stream.

639
00:29:04,303 --> 00:29:05,424
(Monthly transaction)
In the short term,

640
00:29:05,504 --> 00:29:06,904
her performance is very good,

641
00:29:06,984 --> 00:29:08,783
but her return rate is very high.

642
00:29:08,863 --> 00:29:10,743
Moreover, the instant returns
after purchase

643
00:29:10,823 --> 00:29:11,583
are more.

644
00:29:12,783 --> 00:29:14,024
Mr. Chen

645
00:29:15,543 --> 00:29:17,024
has more loyal fans,

646
00:29:17,143 --> 00:29:18,384
and the return rate is low.

647
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,143
The retention is very good.

648
00:29:20,303 --> 00:29:21,984
Let's take another look at Miss Zhuoya.

649
00:29:22,224 --> 00:29:22,944
In terms of data,

650
00:29:23,024 --> 00:29:24,664
among the three,

651
00:29:24,744 --> 00:29:25,944
she performs the best.

652
00:29:26,024 --> 00:29:27,384
However, she is also the first

653
00:29:27,464 --> 00:29:28,584
to be eliminated by us.

654
00:29:28,664 --> 00:29:29,463
She advocated for

655
00:29:29,543 --> 00:29:31,343
the lowest price on the whole market.

656
00:29:31,744 --> 00:29:33,184
To a certain extent,

657
00:29:33,264 --> 00:29:35,184
it will cause product monopoly.

658
00:29:35,504 --> 00:29:36,744
During the festival,

659
00:29:36,863 --> 00:29:38,143
the performance will be good.

660
00:29:38,224 --> 00:29:40,023
But for our future,

661
00:29:40,103 --> 00:29:41,983
it's not conducive
to long-term cooperation.

662
00:29:42,063 --> 00:29:43,223
So we are more inclined

663
00:29:43,303 --> 00:29:45,383
to cooperate with Mr. Chen.

664
00:29:45,543 --> 00:29:47,063
Moreover, I've talked to

665
00:29:47,143 --> 00:29:47,783
their studio.

666
00:29:47,863 --> 00:29:49,424
By leveraging the concept

667
00:29:49,504 --> 00:29:51,983
of dual live-stream,

668
00:29:52,063 --> 00:29:53,783
we can have two options.

669
00:29:54,464 --> 00:29:55,783
Okay, that's about it.

670
00:29:55,863 --> 00:29:56,504
Quite good.

671
00:30:01,504 --> 00:30:02,104
Okay?

672
00:30:02,184 --> 00:30:03,303
Okay, first you talk to

673
00:30:03,383 --> 00:30:04,424
each department.

674
00:30:04,704 --> 00:30:05,623
Here, Chengyi.

675
00:30:05,984 --> 00:30:06,543
Come here.

676
00:30:14,783 --> 00:30:16,583
Everyone can talk big.

677
00:30:17,103 --> 00:30:18,783
You know best what the company wants.

678
00:30:19,504 --> 00:30:20,624
Here's your last chance.

679
00:30:20,704 --> 00:30:21,744
Seize it well.

680
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:23,303
Did you hear me?

681
00:30:23,383 --> 00:30:24,103
Understood.

682
00:30:31,024 --> 00:30:31,664
Where are they?

683
00:30:31,744 --> 00:30:32,303
Come on.

684
00:30:32,783 --> 00:30:33,823
You guys put it.

685
00:30:37,103 --> 00:30:37,983
(Li Xiaoxiao)
(Hello Mr. Mei,)

686
00:30:38,063 --> 00:30:38,624
(I scheduled)

687
00:30:38,704 --> 00:30:40,263
(a date for you at six p.m.)

688
00:30:40,343 --> 00:30:41,823
(Here she is.)

689
00:30:41,912 --> 00:30:43,416

Hello, I am Mei Chengyi.)

691
00:30:49,068 --> 00:30:51,583
(Happy Cake Shop
I have accepted your friend request.)

692
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:52,264
(Who are you?)

693
00:30:53,823 --> 00:30:54,383
(Hello.)

694
00:30:54,704 --> 00:30:56,303
(The marriage agency matched us.)

695
00:30:56,744 --> 00:30:57,863
(My name is Mei Chengyi.)

696
00:30:58,727 --> 00:31:02,360
(Moments)

697
00:31:37,704 --> 00:31:39,344
It's the child's birthday, right?

698
00:31:39,424 --> 00:31:41,424
- Yes.
- I'll give you another set.

699
00:31:41,863 --> 00:31:42,664
Thank you.

700
00:31:43,863 --> 00:31:44,624
I'll come again.

701
00:31:44,704 --> 00:31:45,424
Okay.

702
00:31:45,543 --> 00:31:46,664
Come on, put it together.

703
00:31:49,143 --> 00:31:49,983
Please come again.

704
00:31:50,063 --> 00:31:51,063
- Goodbye.
- Be careful.

705
00:31:52,455 --> 00:31:53,336
(Mei Chengyi)

706
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:58,224
(No Sincerity)
(Hello.)

707
00:31:58,343 --> 00:31:59,264
(Shall we meet)

708
00:31:59,783 --> 00:32:00,543
(and chat a bit)

709
00:32:00,623 --> 00:32:01,704
(at six tonight?)

710
00:32:02,103 --> 00:32:03,103
(No Sincerity?)

711
00:32:03,343 --> 00:32:04,303
(His name)

712
00:32:04,383 --> 00:32:06,143
(is really downright trash.)

713
00:32:07,343 --> 00:32:08,424
(Happy Cake Shop)
(Okay, where?)

714
00:32:14,224 --> 00:32:15,264
(What do you want to eat?)

715
00:32:18,904 --> 00:32:20,303
(You decide. We'll split the bill.)

716
00:32:24,303 --> 00:32:25,383
(Let's meet)

717
00:32:25,623 --> 00:32:27,504
(at the pizza store at Tianjie Street.)

718
00:32:27,863 --> 00:32:28,623
(Is that okay?)

719
00:32:30,704 --> 00:32:31,303
(Alright.)

720
00:32:32,504 --> 00:32:33,624
- Hello.
- Hello.

721
00:32:33,704 --> 00:32:34,864
Are there cake rolls

722
00:32:34,944 --> 00:32:36,344
- and cookies?
- Yes, over there.

723
00:32:36,424 --> 00:32:37,503
You can go and choose.

724
00:32:37,583 --> 00:32:38,264
Okay.

725
00:32:42,984 --> 00:32:43,783
Hello.

726
00:32:47,264 --> 00:32:47,904
Okay, I got it.

727
00:32:47,984 --> 00:32:49,063
I'll come over right away.

728
00:32:50,063 --> 00:32:50,863
Okay.

729
00:32:51,704 --> 00:32:52,504
Lili,

730
00:32:52,623 --> 00:32:53,703
I need to go to the school.

731
00:32:53,783 --> 00:32:54,344
Help me

732
00:32:54,424 --> 00:32:55,583
take care of the customers.

733
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:15,063
What's with your kindergarten?

734
00:33:15,143 --> 00:33:16,583
I am his grandmother.

735
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,584
Is it against the law for me to meet

736
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:19,504
my own grandson?

737
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:20,944
You are not registered

738
00:33:21,024 --> 00:33:22,144
as a pick-up contact.

739
00:33:22,224 --> 00:33:23,144
We haven't received

740
00:33:23,224 --> 00:33:24,703
a notice from Xiaomi's guardian.

741
00:33:24,783 --> 00:33:25,824
You can't even

742
00:33:25,904 --> 00:33:27,384
provide a photo of the child

743
00:33:27,464 --> 00:33:28,144
with you.

744
00:33:28,224 --> 00:33:29,384
He says he doesn't know you.

745
00:33:29,464 --> 00:33:31,463
We can't confirm

746
00:33:31,543 --> 00:33:32,743
you're his grandmother.

747
00:33:32,823 --> 00:33:34,384
How could we let you take him away?

748
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,783
Do you want a photo?

749
00:33:35,863 --> 00:33:36,384
Do you think

750
00:33:36,464 --> 00:33:37,223
Xiaomi and I

751
00:33:37,303 --> 00:33:38,104
don't look alike?

752
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:38,864
We two...

753
00:33:38,944 --> 00:33:39,463
Calm down.

754
00:33:39,543 --> 00:33:40,103
Look alike.

755
00:33:40,343 --> 00:33:41,344
I'll take him away today.

756
00:33:41,424 --> 00:33:42,104
Or you can

757
00:33:42,184 --> 00:33:44,144
have the guardian give us a call.

758
00:33:44,224 --> 00:33:45,144
No way.

759
00:33:45,224 --> 00:33:46,063
I'll take him away.

760
00:33:46,143 --> 00:33:46,823
You can't.

761
00:33:47,184 --> 00:33:48,303
You can't do that.

762
00:33:49,264 --> 00:33:50,703
How can you push me like this?

763
00:33:50,783 --> 00:33:52,144
Really, how can you, as a teacher,

764
00:33:52,224 --> 00:33:53,263
do such things?

765
00:33:53,343 --> 00:33:54,703
Right? How could you?

766
00:33:54,783 --> 00:33:57,023
Are you really my grandmother?

767
00:33:57,103 --> 00:33:57,743
Yes, I am.

768
00:33:57,823 --> 00:33:59,063
I am your grandmother.

769
00:34:00,024 --> 00:34:02,224
Grandma, stop it.

770
00:34:03,984 --> 00:34:04,864
Really?

771
00:34:04,944 --> 00:34:05,543
Okay.

772
00:34:05,623 --> 00:34:06,463
I listen to you.

773
00:34:06,543 --> 00:34:07,144
I'll do exactly

774
00:34:07,224 --> 00:34:07,824
as you say.

775
00:34:07,904 --> 00:34:08,424
Okay?

776
00:34:10,543 --> 00:34:11,344
Xiaomi.

777
00:34:17,663 --> 00:34:18,464
Xiaomi.

778
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,183
Kaixin,

779
00:34:20,663 --> 00:34:21,703
I miss you so much.

780
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,784
Why are you here?

781
00:34:24,703 --> 00:34:26,063
Xiaomi, what's going on?

782
00:34:30,024 --> 00:34:32,024
Xiaomi, come over here.

783
00:34:32,663 --> 00:34:33,464
Miss,

784
00:34:33,984 --> 00:34:34,744
Mom,

785
00:34:34,824 --> 00:34:36,583
I'll send my grandma out.

786
00:34:36,944 --> 00:34:38,023
Alright.

787
00:34:38,103 --> 00:34:40,384
Grandma, I'm still in class now.

788
00:34:40,623 --> 00:34:42,503
Please come to see me again next time.

789
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:43,183
Okay?

790
00:34:43,263 --> 00:34:44,023
Alright, alright.

791
00:34:44,103 --> 00:34:44,784
I'll do that.

792
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,463
I'll do exactly

793
00:34:45,543 --> 00:34:47,183
as you say.

794
00:34:49,183 --> 00:34:49,984
Come on.

795
00:34:51,344 --> 00:34:52,984
Come on, here's a red packet for you.

796
00:34:53,464 --> 00:34:55,384
Come and visit me often!

797
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,583
Give me a kiss.

798
00:35:00,743 --> 00:35:03,304
Did you see that?

799
00:35:03,384 --> 00:35:05,304
I am his real grandma.

800
00:35:07,024 --> 00:35:07,904
I'm leaving now.

801
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:09,183
Goodbye now, bye bye.

802
00:35:09,663 --> 00:35:10,784
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

803
00:35:11,024 --> 00:35:11,984
Kaixin.

804
00:35:13,304 --> 00:35:13,904
See you.

805
00:35:14,183 --> 00:35:14,776
(Sunshine Kindergarten)
Bye bye.

806
00:35:16,743 --> 00:35:17,304
Mom.

807
00:35:17,384 --> 00:35:18,384
What are you doing?

808
00:35:20,183 --> 00:35:21,103
Take it, Mom.

809
00:35:21,183 --> 00:35:22,103
Help me save

810
00:35:22,183 --> 00:35:23,263
Grandma's money.

811
00:35:23,464 --> 00:35:25,464
You can keep it to buy something tasty.

812
00:35:27,543 --> 00:35:29,223
Mom, go back quickly.

813
00:35:32,344 --> 00:35:33,824
Go, go back to class quickly.

814
00:35:35,304 --> 00:35:36,583
Miss, let's go.

815
00:35:36,663 --> 00:35:37,304
Xiaomi,

816
00:35:39,024 --> 00:35:40,223
behave, okay?

817
00:35:40,504 --> 00:35:42,024
Mom, I got it.

818
00:35:58,784 --> 00:36:00,263
Mom, you're back.

819
00:36:01,344 --> 00:36:02,543
You're at home.

820
00:36:03,543 --> 00:36:04,663
Mom, you're back.

821
00:36:09,944 --> 00:36:11,143
Xiaojiao bought you tonics.

822
00:36:11,223 --> 00:36:12,344
- Look.
- Yes, these are all

823
00:36:12,424 --> 00:36:13,864
specially selected for you.

824
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:16,583
Using my son's money to gain favor.

825
00:36:20,824 --> 00:36:22,424
Alright, alright, come on.

826
00:36:24,944 --> 00:36:26,224
Mom, Xiaojiao...

827
00:36:26,304 --> 00:36:28,223
I don't feel well. I'm going to sleep.

828
00:36:35,984 --> 00:36:37,024
She doesn't feel well.

829
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,663
This woman

830
00:36:38,984 --> 00:36:40,063
can't have children.

831
00:36:40,384 --> 00:36:41,023
Stop that.

832
00:36:41,103 --> 00:36:42,143
You start nitpicking

833
00:36:42,223 --> 00:36:43,103
whenever you're home.

834
00:36:43,183 --> 00:36:44,623
What happened? Who upset you?

835
00:36:45,583 --> 00:36:46,424
Where did you go?

836
00:36:48,183 --> 00:36:49,023
I went to

837
00:36:49,103 --> 00:36:49,904
see Xiaomi

838
00:36:49,984 --> 00:36:51,223
at his kindergarten.

839
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:54,183
Let me tell you, he is chubby

840
00:36:55,143 --> 00:36:57,024
and keeps calling me Grandma.

841
00:36:57,143 --> 00:36:58,583
It melted my heart.

842
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:00,424
It's all her fault.

843
00:37:00,543 --> 00:37:01,583
If it weren't for her,

844
00:37:01,743 --> 00:37:02,623
would I

845
00:37:02,864 --> 00:37:04,023
need to sneak around

846
00:37:04,103 --> 00:37:04,864
to see Xiaomi?

847
00:37:04,944 --> 00:37:06,463
Xiaomi would be by my side every day.

848
00:37:06,543 --> 00:37:07,904
Stop that.

849
00:37:07,984 --> 00:37:09,543
You agreed to this back then.

850
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:11,543
Back then,

851
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:13,824
Xu Kaixin's belly

852
00:37:13,904 --> 00:37:14,743
was round.

853
00:37:14,904 --> 00:37:16,583
It looked like she was having a girl.

854
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:17,784
But, it was

855
00:37:18,824 --> 00:37:19,824
a boy.

856
00:37:20,103 --> 00:37:21,984
And besides, it's been three years.

857
00:37:22,103 --> 00:37:23,024
She can't even

858
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:24,503
get pregnant.

859
00:37:24,583 --> 00:37:25,824
Does she even want a kid?

860
00:37:26,183 --> 00:37:27,944
Didn't I get sick

861
00:37:28,024 --> 00:37:29,464
just because of this?

862
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:31,183
I have just this one wish.

863
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:32,623
But it can't be fulfilled.

864
00:37:33,263 --> 00:37:34,583
That's enough.

865
00:37:35,143 --> 00:37:36,103
I have a project,

866
00:37:36,183 --> 00:37:37,023
relying on her uncle.

867
00:37:37,103 --> 00:37:38,663
Please, calm down.

868
00:37:42,543 --> 00:37:44,183
I saw Xu Kaixin today.

869
00:37:44,263 --> 00:37:45,984
She was quite polite to me.

870
00:37:46,384 --> 00:37:47,384
Talk to her again

871
00:37:47,464 --> 00:37:49,424
and get Xiaomi's custody back.

872
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:50,784
I have said it.

873
00:37:51,063 --> 00:37:52,223
She has said

874
00:37:52,424 --> 00:37:54,143
we need to redistribute the assets.

875
00:37:55,183 --> 00:37:56,784
How can she do this?

876
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,143
What does that mean?

877
00:37:58,984 --> 00:38:00,023
The marriage is over.

878
00:38:00,103 --> 00:38:01,464
Can assets still be redistributed?

879
00:38:01,663 --> 00:38:02,944
Yes, the marriage is over.

880
00:38:03,024 --> 00:38:04,784
How can the children be redistributed?

881
00:38:08,663 --> 00:38:10,024
Really!

882
00:38:10,583 --> 00:38:12,263
Not a single thing goes smoothly.

883
00:38:18,703 --> 00:38:21,024
How about you divorce Hu Xiaojiao

884
00:38:21,263 --> 00:38:22,784
and remarry Xu Kaixin.

885
00:38:22,864 --> 00:38:23,503
Then you can

886
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:24,103
be together.

887
00:38:24,183 --> 00:38:25,583
Nonsense.

888
00:38:26,223 --> 00:38:27,464
You shut it.

889
00:38:28,024 --> 00:38:28,744
A family needs

890
00:38:28,824 --> 00:38:29,503
to have children.

891
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:30,744
Or it's not a family.

892
00:38:30,824 --> 00:38:31,824
Alright, alright.

893
00:38:32,743 --> 00:38:34,263
What a silly man.

894
00:38:55,663 --> 00:38:57,103
So funny.

895
00:38:57,344 --> 00:38:59,264
My godson is so skilled!

896
00:38:59,344 --> 00:39:01,223
Xu Kaixin.

897
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,183
If you had

898
00:39:03,263 --> 00:39:04,984
half of Qian Xiaomi's wit,

899
00:39:05,304 --> 00:39:06,384
you'd have

900
00:39:06,464 --> 00:39:07,583
got them bunch of rats.

901
00:39:08,223 --> 00:39:08,983
Dami

902
00:39:09,063 --> 00:39:10,583
is as foolish as I was.

903
00:39:10,784 --> 00:39:11,424
Xiaomi alone

904
00:39:11,504 --> 00:39:12,663
just has

905
00:39:12,743 --> 00:39:13,424
all our family's

906
00:39:13,504 --> 00:39:14,703
wits with him.

907
00:39:15,504 --> 00:39:16,424
I won't stop them

908
00:39:16,504 --> 00:39:18,143
from father-daughter meetings.

909
00:39:18,384 --> 00:39:19,784
But I know Qian Hao

910
00:39:19,864 --> 00:39:20,904
the best.

911
00:39:21,063 --> 00:39:22,264
Besides his mother,

912
00:39:22,344 --> 00:39:23,263
he only loves himself.

913
00:39:23,424 --> 00:39:24,463
That he's good to Dami

914
00:39:24,543 --> 00:39:25,864
must be with an ulterior motive.

915
00:39:26,263 --> 00:39:27,583
In the end, Dami will surely

916
00:39:27,663 --> 00:39:29,463
be greatly disappointed
if her hopes are high.

917
00:39:29,543 --> 00:39:31,103
But I can't stop it.

918
00:39:31,183 --> 00:39:32,743
She'll more determined if you stop her.

919
00:39:32,904 --> 00:39:34,503
It's just like when I lost my mind

920
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:35,583
and insisted on

921
00:39:35,663 --> 00:39:36,703
marrying Qian Hao.

922
00:39:36,824 --> 00:39:37,503
And he turned out

923
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:38,623
to be a rat.

924
00:39:39,424 --> 00:39:40,424
It's not your fault.

925
00:39:40,784 --> 00:39:42,824
Qian Hao can really act

926
00:39:42,904 --> 00:39:44,183
and fake it too well.

927
00:39:44,263 --> 00:39:45,663
You know,

928
00:39:45,743 --> 00:39:47,384
how could we tell he was such a rat?

929
00:39:47,543 --> 00:39:48,784
How does the saying go?

930
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,623
Say goodbye to wrong one,

931
00:39:50,703 --> 00:39:52,063
so you can meet the right one.

932
00:39:52,263 --> 00:39:53,784
Think of it as the bitterness of love,

933
00:39:53,864 --> 00:39:55,183
all wasted on him.

934
00:39:55,263 --> 00:39:56,263
The left will be sweet.

935
00:39:56,663 --> 00:39:57,703
I think,

936
00:39:57,784 --> 00:39:58,543
the essence of love

937
00:39:58,623 --> 00:40:00,024
is really just those hormones.

938
00:40:00,263 --> 00:40:01,143
Now, I have

939
00:40:01,263 --> 00:40:02,983
long entered the nurturing phase.

940
00:40:03,063 --> 00:40:04,663
No longer deceived by hormones.

941
00:40:05,344 --> 00:40:06,464
So what's next?

942
00:40:06,663 --> 00:40:07,384
Not loving?

943
00:40:07,464 --> 00:40:08,424
How can that be?

944
00:40:08,504 --> 00:40:09,503
I should go for it.

945
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:10,944
I'm not easy to fool.

946
00:40:11,663 --> 00:40:12,384
But,

947
00:40:12,464 --> 00:40:14,183
from now on, we'll look for a partner

948
00:40:14,263 --> 00:40:14,983
to raise kids,

949
00:40:15,063 --> 00:40:15,864
watch movies,

950
00:40:15,944 --> 00:40:16,744
and travel.

951
00:40:16,824 --> 00:40:18,264
If we enjoy it, do it together.

952
00:40:18,344 --> 00:40:19,984
You're making me drool.

953
00:40:22,904 --> 00:40:23,736
Let's be serious.

954
00:40:23,864 --> 00:40:24,784
That guy asked you out?

955
00:40:24,864 --> 00:40:25,623
Yes, he did.

956
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:26,583
Tonight at six.

957
00:40:27,304 --> 00:40:28,264
Let me remind you,

958
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:29,583
don't be blinded by appearance

959
00:40:30,103 --> 00:40:31,424
and get fooled again.

960
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:33,103
Now, it remains uncertain

961
00:40:33,183 --> 00:40:34,944
who is deceiving whom.

962
00:40:50,904 --> 00:40:51,904
Sir, welcome.

963
00:41:01,944 --> 00:41:02,743
Xu Kaixin.

964
00:41:03,904 --> 00:41:04,904
Mr. Mei, right?

965
00:41:04,984 --> 00:41:05,743
Yes.

966
00:41:06,103 --> 00:41:06,904
Nice to meet you.

967
00:41:06,984 --> 00:41:07,743
Please.

968
00:41:18,504 --> 00:41:19,904
Mr. Mei,

969
00:41:19,984 --> 00:41:21,583
what would you like?

970
00:41:24,304 --> 00:41:27,063
I'm good.

971
00:41:27,143 --> 00:41:28,143
I'll pass.

972
00:41:28,623 --> 00:41:30,464
Would you like to order another drink?

973
00:41:32,904 --> 00:41:33,784
Um, I...

974
00:41:33,864 --> 00:41:35,143
I'll just have a glass of water.

975
00:41:35,424 --> 00:41:36,384
No, thank you.

976
00:41:36,464 --> 00:41:37,103
Alright.

977
00:41:38,024 --> 00:41:38,983
Ride the big horse.

978
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:40,143
Quickly ride the big horse.

979
00:41:40,504 --> 00:41:41,543
Ride the big horse.

980
00:41:41,623 --> 00:41:42,384
- Okay.
- No.

981
00:41:42,464 --> 00:41:43,824
You've ridden for ages.

982
00:41:43,904 --> 00:41:45,663
Alright, alright.

983
00:41:46,743 --> 00:41:47,864
You next.

984
00:41:48,543 --> 00:41:49,344
Alright, come on.

985
00:41:50,063 --> 00:41:53,464
Hello, please insert one coin.

986
00:41:55,384 --> 00:41:57,143
Please sit still and hold tight.

987
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:59,183
We're about to start.

988
00:42:00,024 --> 00:42:03,543
What is your father's father called?

989
00:42:03,904 --> 00:42:06,984
Your father's father is called Grandpa.

990
00:42:07,824 --> 00:42:10,384
What is your father's brother called?

991
00:42:10,824 --> 00:42:14,344
Your father's brother is called Uncle.

992
00:42:14,904 --> 00:42:17,904
What is your father's wife called?

993
00:42:18,583 --> 00:42:22,183
Your father's wife is called Mom.

994
00:42:22,263 --> 00:42:23,063
Correct.

995
00:42:23,663 --> 00:42:26,263
Sorry, pause.

996
00:42:27,984 --> 00:42:29,583
I'm going to take a call.

997
00:42:30,143 --> 00:42:30,904
Okay.

998
00:42:34,824 --> 00:42:35,464
Who is it?

999
00:42:38,143 --> 00:42:38,944
(Mr. Zhou)
(Mr. You,)

1000
00:42:39,024 --> 00:42:40,663
(I saw this while dining outside.)

1001
00:42:40,743 --> 00:42:42,183
(Is this your son-in-law?)

1002
00:42:53,183 --> 00:42:54,864
I can't believe you, Mei Chengyi.

1003
00:42:56,263 --> 00:42:58,143
Our whole family take care of your kids.

1004
00:42:58,344 --> 00:42:59,224
And you're

1005
00:42:59,304 --> 00:43:00,944
hanging out for a date, huh?

1006
00:43:02,904 --> 00:43:04,344
I'll ruin it.
