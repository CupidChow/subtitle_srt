(lived a beautiful and lovely)

18
00:01:41,383 --> 00:01:42,704
(little mermaid princess.)

19
00:01:42,984 --> 00:01:44,663
(On her fifteenth birthday,)

20
00:01:44,743 --> 00:01:46,264
(she floated to the sea surface)

21
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,103
(to see the world outside.)

22
00:01:48,663 --> 00:01:49,624
(On the sea surface,)

23
00:01:49,704 --> 00:01:50,544
(she saw)

24
00:01:50,624 --> 00:01:51,743
(a handsome prince.)

25
00:01:52,023 --> 00:01:53,744
(The prince, with all his strength,)

26
00:01:53,824 --> 00:01:55,824
(hugged the little mermaid and said,)

27
00:01:55,943 --> 00:01:56,743
("Help.")

28
00:01:57,704 --> 00:01:59,904
(The little mermaid smacked the prince)

29
00:01:59,984 --> 00:02:01,423
(with a powerful slap,)

30
00:02:01,503 --> 00:02:03,503
(wagged her tail,
and dived back into the sea.)

31
00:02:04,064 --> 00:02:04,783
(From then on,)

32
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:06,583
(the mermaid princess and her family)

33
00:02:06,663 --> 00:02:08,903
(Andersen's fairy tale)
(lived happily ever after.)

34
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,024
Alright.

35
00:02:13,104 --> 00:02:13,703
That's it.

36
00:02:13,783 --> 00:02:15,984
Time to sleep.
I'll give you the gift tomorrow.

37
00:02:16,264 --> 00:02:16,864
Mom,

38
00:02:16,944 --> 00:02:18,103
why didn't the mermaid

39
00:02:18,183 --> 00:02:19,303
save the prince?

40
00:02:20,623 --> 00:02:22,823
The mermaid princess was only fifteen.

41
00:02:22,903 --> 00:02:24,783
She was still her mommy's baby.

42
00:02:25,224 --> 00:02:26,104
Here's a question.

43
00:02:26,583 --> 00:02:28,024
What would you do

44
00:02:28,104 --> 00:02:30,224
if a stranger were pestering you?

45
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,464
If a stranger gives me candy,

46
00:02:32,544 --> 00:02:33,983
I won't take it.

47
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:35,503
If a stranger wants to take me away,

48
00:02:35,583 --> 00:02:37,064
I won't go.

49
00:02:37,144 --> 00:02:38,584
If a stranger knocks on the door,

50
00:02:38,664 --> 00:02:40,223
I won't open up.

51
00:02:40,303 --> 00:02:43,104
Smart babies won't be fooled.

52
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:45,224
Good job.

53
00:02:48,984 --> 00:02:50,303
Don't mislead the child.

54
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:02,983
You completely messed up

55
00:03:03,063 --> 00:03:04,743
Andersen's fairy tale.

56
00:03:05,384 --> 00:03:06,663
What kind of story

57
00:03:06,743 --> 00:03:08,424
did Andersen tell?

58
00:03:08,743 --> 00:03:09,624
The little mermaid

59
00:03:09,704 --> 00:03:10,503
gave up her life

60
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:11,744
for an untrustworthy man.

61
00:03:11,824 --> 00:03:13,504
It would only hurt her family.

62
00:03:14,104 --> 00:03:15,103
I made some

63
00:03:15,183 --> 00:03:16,264
fundamental changes.

64
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:17,263
From now on,

65
00:03:17,343 --> 00:03:19,224
my kids will stay away from bad people.

66
00:03:19,623 --> 00:03:21,023
Stop making things up.

67
00:03:21,303 --> 00:03:22,783
Xiaomi is a boy.

68
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:23,663
Boys need to learn

69
00:03:23,743 --> 00:03:24,744
even better.

70
00:03:24,824 --> 00:03:25,543
If he ends up

71
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:26,983
like his untrustworthy dad,

72
00:03:27,063 --> 00:03:28,583
no one will save him.

73
00:03:28,984 --> 00:03:29,984
Nonsense.

74
00:03:30,783 --> 00:03:31,984
Let's be serious.

75
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,104
Dami has been off lately.

76
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:36,663
At night, she hides

77
00:03:36,743 --> 00:03:38,024
in her room

78
00:03:38,104 --> 00:03:39,504
and locks the door sometimes.

79
00:03:39,704 --> 00:03:41,384
Once, I went in

80
00:03:41,623 --> 00:03:43,464
and saw her video chatting

81
00:03:43,544 --> 00:03:44,943
with someone happily.

82
00:03:45,023 --> 00:03:47,064
As soon as she saw me,
she pulled a long face

83
00:03:47,144 --> 00:03:48,463
and threw a tantrum at me.

84
00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:50,223
I've heard the frauds

85
00:03:50,303 --> 00:03:51,824
are targeting kids now.

86
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:53,264
I'm worried that Dami

87
00:03:53,544 --> 00:03:55,023
might be scammed.

88
00:03:56,023 --> 00:03:57,224
It's fishy, indeed.

89
00:03:57,424 --> 00:03:59,063
She's studying at this hour?

90
00:03:59,183 --> 00:04:00,504
This is not like her.

91
00:04:05,903 --> 00:04:06,704
Dami.

92
00:04:07,264 --> 00:04:08,503
What? I'm studying.

93
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,384
Open the door.

94
00:04:11,104 --> 00:04:11,944
Open the door.

95
00:04:12,504 --> 00:04:13,783
Or I'll barge in.

96
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:14,944
One.

97
00:04:15,063 --> 00:04:15,863
Two.

98
00:04:19,824 --> 00:04:21,104
What are you doing?

99
00:04:21,184 --> 00:04:22,143
Tattletale.

100
00:04:22,223 --> 00:04:23,463
Show some respect

101
00:04:23,543 --> 00:04:24,463
to your grandaunt.

102
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,104
Qian Xiaomi.

103
00:04:33,184 --> 00:04:34,383
Do you want to talk to Dad?

104
00:04:34,463 --> 00:04:35,223
No.

105
00:04:36,064 --> 00:04:36,944
You're heartless.

106
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,423
(My name is Xu Kaixin.)

107
00:05:06,504 --> 00:05:07,543
(I'm 33.)

108
00:05:07,663 --> 00:05:08,544
("Xu" means "wish".)

109
00:05:08,624 --> 00:05:10,184
("Kaixin" means "happy".)

110
00:05:10,384 --> 00:05:11,023
(This name)

111
00:05:11,103 --> 00:05:12,064
(was given to me)

112
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:14,144
(by this kind old lady
in the living room.)

113
00:05:14,463 --> 00:05:15,624
(It is said that)

114
00:05:15,704 --> 00:05:17,504
(my birth was just an accident.)

115
00:05:17,704 --> 00:05:18,583
(My birth mother left)

116
00:05:18,663 --> 00:05:20,384
(one month after she gave birth.)

117
00:05:20,543 --> 00:05:21,424
(I am just)

118
00:05:21,504 --> 00:05:23,504
(a souvenir she left for her family.)

119
00:05:23,864 --> 00:05:25,504
(It was my aunt who raised me.)

120
00:05:26,023 --> 00:05:26,744
(This woman)

121
00:05:26,824 --> 00:05:28,583
(dedicated her entire life to me.)

122
00:05:28,744 --> 00:05:30,624
(I call her forever young)

123
00:05:30,704 --> 00:05:31,624
(Lili.)

124
00:05:32,023 --> 00:05:34,184
(She isn't my mom,
but she's done more for me.)

125
00:05:34,704 --> 00:05:36,384
(Lili wished for my happiness.)

126
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:38,423
(So, I must be happy)

127
00:05:38,543 --> 00:05:40,783
(in my ordinary life.)

128
00:05:49,103 --> 00:05:51,064
(Landlord)
(Pay the utilities. It was 73 yuan.)

129
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:54,263
(That's right.)

130
00:05:54,343 --> 00:05:55,703
(I rented this place.)

131
00:05:55,783 --> 00:05:56,624
(You think I would)

132
00:05:56,704 --> 00:05:57,784
(say in an artsy way)

133
00:05:57,864 --> 00:05:59,184
(that life is your own?)

134
00:06:00,023 --> 00:06:00,983
(You've got it wrong.)

135
00:06:01,504 --> 00:06:02,224
(There used to be)

136
00:06:02,304 --> 00:06:03,624
(a 140-square-meter apartment)

137
00:06:03,704 --> 00:06:04,903
(under my name.)

138
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:06,824
(I saved up for its down payment)

139
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,023
(and installments.)

140
00:06:08,223 --> 00:06:09,104
(But after I took in)

141
00:06:09,184 --> 00:06:10,583
(my homeless bestie,)

142
00:06:10,824 --> 00:06:12,624
(she lured my untrustworthy ex-husband.)

143
00:06:12,824 --> 00:06:13,744
(They even conspired)

144
00:06:13,824 --> 00:06:15,543
(to kick my kids and me out the door.)

145
00:06:16,384 --> 00:06:17,703
(If I were given)

146
00:06:17,783 --> 00:06:19,304
(another chance,)

147
00:06:19,384 --> 00:06:21,504
(I would punch my hypocrite bestie)

148
00:06:21,744 --> 00:06:23,103
(and untrustworthy ex-husband.)

149
00:06:23,304 --> 00:06:24,744
(Avoid being blinded by love.)

150
00:06:24,824 --> 00:06:26,704
(Never be a saint.)

151
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:38,864
Who messed up

152
00:06:38,944 --> 00:06:40,103
the code?

153
00:07:04,864 --> 00:07:05,663
I...

154
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:14,223
Yeah.

155
00:07:15,064 --> 00:07:16,503
I flew back

156
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:18,423
from Beijing this afternoon.

157
00:07:18,663 --> 00:07:19,903
Flight No. 0819.

158
00:07:22,704 --> 00:07:24,383
Yeah, my luggage arrived late.

159
00:07:24,463 --> 00:07:26,823
I left first and my colleague
brought it back for me.

160
00:07:26,903 --> 00:07:27,984
The moment I saw it,

161
00:07:28,064 --> 00:07:29,223
I realized it wasn't mine.

162
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:30,383
Sorry, sir.

163
00:07:30,463 --> 00:07:31,823
We checked the record.

164
00:07:31,903 --> 00:07:32,463
A lady

165
00:07:32,543 --> 00:07:33,823
on the same flight

166
00:07:33,903 --> 00:07:34,864
also called in

167
00:07:34,944 --> 00:07:36,304
for the same thing.

168
00:07:36,384 --> 00:07:37,143
You two must have

169
00:07:37,223 --> 00:07:38,304
gotten the wrong luggage.

170
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:40,384
When would be convenient for you?

171
00:07:40,783 --> 00:07:42,543
Well, that's great.

172
00:07:42,903 --> 00:07:44,064
May I have that lady's

173
00:07:44,144 --> 00:07:44,703
phone number?

174
00:07:44,783 --> 00:07:46,744
I'll meet with her in the city.

175
00:07:47,783 --> 00:07:48,664
That lady requested

176
00:07:48,744 --> 00:07:50,263
that you return the luggage

177
00:07:50,343 --> 00:07:51,784
to the airport and hand it over

178
00:07:51,864 --> 00:07:52,744
in front of our staff.

179
00:07:53,304 --> 00:07:54,423
So troublesome?

180
00:07:55,944 --> 00:07:57,304
How about 9 AM

181
00:07:57,384 --> 00:07:58,103
tomorrow?

182
00:08:01,176 --> 00:08:04,312
(Xu Kaixin
Li Xiaoxiao)

183
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,424
(What's going on?)

184
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:06,864
(Discount at the supermarket?)

185
00:08:07,064 --> 00:08:07,944
(So many.)

186
00:08:12,463 --> 00:08:13,343
(Get lost.)

187
00:08:13,423 --> 00:08:14,864
(I got the wrong luggage.)

188
00:08:14,944 --> 00:08:15,984
(It got me thinking.)

189
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:17,144
(It's nice to be young.)

190
00:08:20,144 --> 00:08:20,864
Dad.

191
00:08:20,944 --> 00:08:21,744
Dad.

192
00:08:22,343 --> 00:08:23,664
I missed you so much.

193
00:08:23,744 --> 00:08:24,663
Did you miss me?

194
00:08:25,023 --> 00:08:26,023
Yeah, I missed you.

195
00:08:26,463 --> 00:08:27,343
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

196
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,504
I missed you.

197
00:08:28,624 --> 00:08:29,583
Youyou, thank you

198
00:08:29,864 --> 00:08:31,224
for taking care of them

199
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:32,064
with your parents

200
00:08:32,144 --> 00:08:33,063
while I was away.

201
00:08:33,264 --> 00:08:34,063
No problem.

202
00:08:35,464 --> 00:08:36,264
Have you been good?

203
00:08:36,384 --> 00:08:37,703
Chengyi, do you have a minute?

204
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:38,864
Let's take a walk

205
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:39,984
and talk a bit.

206
00:08:40,183 --> 00:08:40,984
Okay.

207
00:08:41,504 --> 00:08:42,064
Go.

208
00:08:42,144 --> 00:08:42,983
Brush your teeth

209
00:08:43,063 --> 00:08:43,703
and get changed.

210
00:08:43,783 --> 00:08:45,144
Your auntie and I will talk.

211
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:46,504
- Alright, bye.
- Bye, Auntie.

212
00:09:22,903 --> 00:09:23,583
Didn't we agree

213
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,344
that I'd make breakfast today?

214
00:09:25,663 --> 00:09:26,743
You night owl.

215
00:09:26,823 --> 00:09:28,184
You went to sleep so late.

216
00:09:28,264 --> 00:09:29,424
So just sleep a bit longer.

217
00:09:29,504 --> 00:09:31,104
Go away. You're slowing me down.

218
00:09:35,703 --> 00:09:36,703
Morning.

219
00:09:37,903 --> 00:09:39,344
Why are you up so early today?

220
00:09:40,023 --> 00:09:40,823
The self-study

221
00:09:40,903 --> 00:09:42,344

222
00:09:43,864 --> 00:09:44,943
Get up.

223
00:09:46,264 --> 00:09:47,063
Don't be lazy.

224
00:09:47,663 --> 00:09:48,783
Come on. Get up.

225
00:09:49,144 --> 00:09:50,783

232
00:09:59,703 --> 00:10:00,823

233
00:10:08,344 --> 00:10:09,144

She didn't mention it.

This is yours, right?

347
00:15:06,744 --> 00:15:08,024
I realized it wasn't mine

348
00:15:08,104 --> 00:15:09,543
before I even opened it.

349
00:15:10,063 --> 00:15:11,543
This is mine. This is yours, right?

350
00:15:12,104 --> 00:15:13,384
Yeah, here.

351
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:17,543
I've opened it.

352
00:15:18,703 --> 00:15:19,384
What...

353
00:15:19,464 --> 00:15:20,744

00:15:21,183 --> 00:15:21,863
My kids often

355
00:15:21,943 --> 00:15:22,703
mess up the code,

356
00:15:22,783 --> 00:15:23,863
so I'm quite experienced

357
00:15:23,943 --> 00:15:25,063
in that aspect.

358
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:26,184
But rest assured.

359
00:15:26,264 --> 00:15:27,303

Sir,

361
00:15:28,423 --> 00:15:29,424
would you like to check

362
00:15:29,504 --> 00:15:31,024
if anything is missing?

363
00:15:31,104 --> 00:15:33,024
- I...
- Considering the content,

364
00:15:33,104 --> 00:15:34,463
I advise you not to open it.

365
00:15:34,543 --> 00:15:36,063
You're going to be awkward.

366
00:15:39,303 --> 00:15:39,904
Excuse me.

367
00:15:39,984 --> 00:15:41,024
Let me explain it.

368
00:15:41,104 --> 00:15:41,863
These things...

369
00:15:41,943 --> 00:15:42,784
How do I put it?

370
00:15:42,864 --> 00:15:43,424
This is not

371
00:15:43,504 --> 00:15:44,264

Sir,

376
00:15:48,224 --> 00:15:49,024
we're both adults.

377

You really don't

378
00:15:50,023 --> 00:15:51,344
have to explain anything.

379
00:15:51,464 --> 00:15:52,623
But your job

380
00:15:52,703 --> 00:15:54,183
is quite challenging.

381
00:15:54,264 --> 00:15:56,783
- I have to go.
- You...

382
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,784
Sir,

383
00:15:57,864 --> 00:15:59,144
are you sure you won't

384
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:00,183
check it a bit?

385
00:16:02,104 --> 00:16:03,184
N-No need.

386
00:16:03,264 --> 00:16:04,303
Thank you.

387
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:19,640
(Happy Cake Shop)

388
00:16:48,303 --> 00:16:49,984
The title of my essay is

389
00:16:50,104 --> 00:16:51,183
"My Dad".

390
00:16:51,783 --> 00:16:52,504
My Dad

391
00:16:52,584 --> 00:16:54,303
is the best in the world.

392
00:16:54,384 --> 00:16:56,144
He works very hard abroad.

393
00:16:56,264 --> 00:16:57,343
Once he comes home,

394
00:16:57,423 --> 00:16:59,063
he always hugs me first.

395
00:16:59,464 --> 00:17:00,304
Although he's not

396
00:17:00,384 --> 00:17:01,903
by my side on my birthday,

397
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,064
he always buys me

398
00:17:03,144 --> 00:17:04,304
birthday gifts

399
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:06,144
and gives them to me at once.

400
00:17:06,784 --> 00:17:08,544
Dad cares about me a lot.

401
00:17:08,663 --> 00:17:09,784
Once,

402
00:17:10,024 --> 00:17:11,584
I had trouble

403
00:17:11,703 --> 00:17:13,703
solving a question in my homework.

404
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,903
I just couldn't figure it out.

405
00:17:16,223 --> 00:17:17,584
So I called Dad.

406
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:20,024
Dad kept explaining

407
00:17:20,104 --> 00:17:21,304
until I understood.

408
00:17:21,824 --> 00:17:22,784
Every time he's home,

409
00:17:22,864 --> 00:17:23,663
he buys me

410
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,144
lots of tasty things,

411
00:17:25,423 --> 00:17:26,544
takes me out for fun,

412
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:27,663
and buys toys

413
00:17:27,743 --> 00:17:29,064
and pretty clothes.

414
00:17:29,903 --> 00:17:31,984
My dad is the best.

415
00:17:32,064 --> 00:17:33,304
I love my dad.

416
00:17:45,903 --> 00:17:47,263
It's over.

417
00:17:47,624 --> 00:17:49,463
I bet I'll be laid off.

418
00:17:53,344 --> 00:17:54,143
What are you doing?

419
00:17:54,223 --> 00:17:55,224
Mei.

420
00:17:55,304 --> 00:17:56,223
Mei, you finally came.

421
00:17:57,344 --> 00:17:58,943
I went to the QC department.

422
00:17:59,263 --> 00:17:59,944
Well...

423
00:18:00,024 --> 00:18:00,983
Mei.

424
00:18:01,064 --> 00:18:02,583
The director checked on you twice.

425
00:18:02,663 --> 00:18:03,384
Yeah.

426
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:04,663
She checked on me?

427
00:18:06,104 --> 00:18:07,024
What's it about?

428
00:18:07,104 --> 00:18:08,784
N-Nothing much.

429
00:18:08,864 --> 00:18:09,663
It's just...

430
00:18:11,344 --> 00:18:12,183
N-Nothing.

431
00:18:13,144 --> 00:18:14,423
- There is something.
- Yeah.

432
00:18:14,503 --> 00:18:16,263
The company is doing layoffs again.

433
00:18:16,384 --> 00:18:17,903
Everyone is worried about

434
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,503
being assessed by the director.

435
00:18:19,903 --> 00:18:20,623
So, we have been

436
00:18:20,703 --> 00:18:21,903
avoiding the director

437
00:18:22,024 --> 00:18:23,823
as much as we can these days.

438
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:25,384
You are our team leader.

439
00:18:25,624 --> 00:18:26,464
Will you talk to her?

440
00:18:26,544 --> 00:18:27,544
She's looking for you.

441
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:28,824
Yeah.

442
00:18:32,624 --> 00:18:33,423
Well...

443
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:34,703
I see.

444
00:18:34,903 --> 00:18:36,503
Go about your business.

445
00:18:36,584 --> 00:18:38,304
Ask her what's going on.

446
00:18:38,943 --> 00:18:40,263
Okay.

447
00:18:40,903 --> 00:18:41,743
Hello, Mei.

448
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:44,384
- Are you happy?
- Yeah.

449
00:19:07,423 --> 00:19:09,344
It won't be me.

450
00:19:13,503 --> 00:19:14,224
Ms. Li.

451
00:19:14,304 --> 00:19:15,024
Come in.

452
00:19:17,064 --> 00:19:18,463
You know why I'm looking for you?

453
00:19:21,344 --> 00:19:24,703
Because I took
too many days off last month?

454
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:26,784
But you know

455
00:19:26,864 --> 00:19:28,583
that I had no choice.

456
00:19:28,663 --> 00:19:29,784
Flu cases are spiking.

457
00:19:29,864 --> 00:19:31,944
Both my kids caught it.

458
00:19:32,024 --> 00:19:33,064
It's like winning

459
00:19:33,144 --> 00:19:34,663
the lottery to register

460
00:19:34,784 --> 00:19:36,504
at the hospital these days.

461
00:19:36,584 --> 00:19:37,304
Enough.

462
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,624
Drop the act.

463
00:19:41,144 --> 00:19:41,944
You know HR has been

464
00:19:42,024 --> 00:19:43,544
talking to people, right?

465
00:19:45,024 --> 00:19:45,824
Really?

466
00:19:49,183 --> 00:19:49,903
We need to

467
00:19:49,983 --> 00:19:51,304
lay off three people.

468
00:19:51,544 --> 00:19:52,344
Chengyi.

469
00:19:52,503 --> 00:19:53,304
You're putting me

470
00:19:54,503 --> 00:19:55,864
in a difficult position.

471
00:19:56,423 --> 00:19:57,863
Ms. Li, please don't do this.

472
00:19:57,943 --> 00:19:59,504
I really need this job.

473
00:19:59,584 --> 00:20:00,183
I have to pay

474
00:20:00,263 --> 00:20:01,343
the monthly mortgage.

475
00:20:01,423 --> 00:20:02,183
It takes a fortune

476
00:20:02,263 --> 00:20:03,544
to raise two kids.

477
00:20:03,624 --> 00:20:04,544
That's enough.

478
00:20:04,624 --> 00:20:05,623
Drop the act.

479
00:20:05,703 --> 00:20:06,944
Be yourself, okay?

480
00:20:07,024 --> 00:20:07,784
Sit down.

481
00:20:13,624 --> 00:20:14,504
I personally

482
00:20:14,584 --> 00:20:15,863
recruited you years ago.

483
00:20:15,943 --> 00:20:17,824
I'm aware of your abilities.

484
00:20:18,423 --> 00:20:19,423
But think about

485
00:20:19,503 --> 00:20:20,263
your performance.

486
00:20:20,784 --> 00:20:21,464
Do you really

487
00:20:21,544 --> 00:20:22,784
deserve your salary?

488
00:20:22,864 --> 00:20:23,663
I know.

489
00:20:23,824 --> 00:20:24,823
It's not easy for you

490
00:20:24,903 --> 00:20:26,343
to raise two children

491
00:20:26,423 --> 00:20:27,103
on your own.

492
00:20:27,183 --> 00:20:27,744
But we're not

493
00:20:27,824 --> 00:20:29,263
running a welfare organization.

494
00:20:29,344 --> 00:20:30,223
Look at you.

495
00:20:30,824 --> 00:20:32,064
You take leave every day

496
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:33,423
and arrive late for work.

497
00:20:33,544 --> 00:20:36,784
Your team members can tolerate it
once, twice, or maybe more times.

498
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:38,104
What next?

499
00:20:39,384 --> 00:20:40,824
Who can tolerate it forever?

500
00:20:45,864 --> 00:20:46,663
Ms. Li.

501
00:20:47,624 --> 00:20:48,784
Here's your last chance.

502
00:20:48,983 --> 00:20:50,103
Let's see how well you do

503
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:51,223
in three months.

504
00:20:51,304 --> 00:20:52,104
You're on your own.

505
00:20:52,703 --> 00:20:53,503
Thank you.

506
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:55,383
I swear

507
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:56,983
I won't let you down again.

508
00:21:00,104 --> 00:21:00,903
By the way,

509
00:21:02,624 --> 00:21:03,383
doesn't your son

510
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,503
like building blocks?

511
00:21:06,304 --> 00:21:07,103
A friend of mine

512
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:09,143
bought a limited edition abroad.

513
00:21:09,223 --> 00:21:10,064
Exclusively overseas.

514
00:21:10,824 --> 00:21:11,864
It's too big.

515
00:21:12,743 --> 00:21:14,343
I can't just bring it with me.

516
00:21:14,423 --> 00:21:16,624
I'll get it to your car after work.

517
00:21:18,024 --> 00:21:18,824
Come on.

518
00:21:19,304 --> 00:21:20,263
What are you doing?

519
00:21:20,663 --> 00:21:21,903
How can I accept that?

520
00:21:22,223 --> 00:21:24,304
Come on, don't be so distant.

521
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,703
A little gift.

522
00:21:26,024 --> 00:21:27,183
Alright, go to work.

523
00:21:27,263 --> 00:21:28,623
Okay, I'll get back to work.

524
00:21:28,703 --> 00:21:29,423
Alright.

525
00:21:38,344 --> 00:21:39,144
Three months.

526
00:21:39,384 --> 00:21:40,183
Three months.

527
00:21:40,743 --> 00:21:41,383
Have a bite.

528
00:21:41,463 --> 00:21:42,144
Come on, sweetie.

529
00:21:44,384 --> 00:21:45,423
What else would you like?

530
00:21:46,344 --> 00:21:47,864
Strawberry cake.

531
00:21:47,983 --> 00:21:48,623
No problem.

532
00:21:48,703 --> 00:21:49,544
My daughter will get

533
00:21:49,624 --> 00:21:50,503
whatever she wants.

534
00:21:50,584 --> 00:21:51,663
You are the best.

535
00:21:51,983 --> 00:21:53,544
Are you happy to hang out with me?

536
00:21:53,624 --> 00:21:55,064
Yeah, I'm so happy.

537
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,103
You're so happy?

538
00:21:58,183 --> 00:22:00,103
Are you not happy being with Mom?

539
00:22:00,183 --> 00:22:01,064
No, I'm not.

540
00:22:01,263 --> 00:22:02,343
The landlord keeps coming.

541
00:22:02,423 --> 00:22:04,024
Mom doesn't care about me

542
00:22:04,104 --> 00:22:05,223
as she's never home.

543
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,623
Lili lectures me all day.
So old-fashioned.

544
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:08,224
Breakfast

545
00:22:08,304 --> 00:22:09,663
is always noodles and eggs.

546
00:22:09,743 --> 00:22:10,343
She forces us

547
00:22:10,423 --> 00:22:11,624
to attend tutoring classes.

548
00:22:11,903 --> 00:22:14,423
Dance, piano, and English.

549
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,024
It's driving me crazy.

550
00:22:16,344 --> 00:22:17,823
Dad, I really miss you.

551
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,504
When can I live with you?

552
00:22:19,584 --> 00:22:20,744
My daughter has suffered.

553
00:22:20,824 --> 00:22:21,823
I will try to get you

554
00:22:21,903 --> 00:22:22,744
and your brother

555
00:22:22,824 --> 00:22:24,504
- to move in, okay?
- Okay.

556
00:22:24,584 --> 00:22:25,984
Do you want to live with me?

557
00:22:26,064 --> 00:22:26,824
Yeah.

558
00:22:27,743 --> 00:22:29,784
But Xiaomi might not agree.

559
00:22:29,903 --> 00:22:31,503
It's okay. Xiaomi is still young.

560
00:22:31,824 --> 00:22:32,704
Persuade your brother.

561
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,623
- Take him with you, okay?
- Okay.

562
00:22:34,703 --> 00:22:35,663
Ms. Xiaojiao and I

563
00:22:35,743 --> 00:22:36,504
will tidy up

564
00:22:36,584 --> 00:22:37,663
the apartment for you.

565
00:22:37,743 --> 00:22:38,784
Everything is ready.

566
00:22:38,864 --> 00:22:39,984
You can move in anytime.

567
00:22:40,064 --> 00:22:40,824
Okay?

568
00:22:47,144 --> 00:22:48,024
Xu Kaixin.

569
00:22:50,104 --> 00:22:50,823
A-Are you crazy?

570
00:22:50,903 --> 00:22:51,623
You've become

571
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,304
such a shrew in these years.

572
00:22:54,344 --> 00:22:55,224
Back then,

573
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:56,064
I was too kind.

574
00:22:56,144 --> 00:22:57,624
That's why I got bullied by you.

575
00:22:57,784 --> 00:22:59,103
But I've come around to it.

576
00:22:59,183 --> 00:23:00,743
Whoever upsets me shall pay

577
00:23:01,104 --> 00:23:02,503
ten times the price.

578
00:23:03,304 --> 00:23:03,903
Listen.

579
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:04,823
Don't go too far.

580
00:23:04,903 --> 00:23:05,984
She is my daughter.

581
00:23:06,064 --> 00:23:07,824
I've paid the child support.

582
00:23:07,983 --> 00:23:09,503
Why can't I check on her?

583
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:11,064
Child support? Alright.

584
00:23:14,104 --> 00:23:15,264
Let's sit down and talk

585
00:23:15,344 --> 00:23:16,584
about the child support.

586
00:23:17,983 --> 00:23:18,784
Qian Hao.

587
00:23:19,144 --> 00:23:21,423
You had an affair
with Hu Xiaojiao and tricked me

588
00:23:21,624 --> 00:23:23,504
into registering our house
under your name

589
00:23:23,584 --> 00:23:24,583
and divorcing you.

590
00:23:24,663 --> 00:23:25,464
Then you kicked

591
00:23:25,544 --> 00:23:26,583
my kids and me out

592
00:23:26,663 --> 00:23:27,703
as if we were strangers.

593
00:23:27,903 --> 00:23:29,103
I got half of

594
00:23:29,183 --> 00:23:30,224
the joint property,

595
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,583
which was around 60,000 yuan,

596
00:23:31,663 --> 00:23:33,064
as a one-time child support.

597
00:23:33,743 --> 00:23:34,504
Have you paid

598
00:23:34,584 --> 00:23:35,944
a single cent for their food,

599
00:23:36,024 --> 00:23:37,343
clothing, and schooling?

600
00:23:37,423 --> 00:23:39,183
Dad bought me many gifts.

601
00:23:41,384 --> 00:23:41,984
You really are

602
00:23:42,064 --> 00:23:43,304
his daughter.

603
00:23:43,384 --> 00:23:44,784
You've inherited

604
00:23:44,864 --> 00:23:46,304
all his selfish genes.

605
00:23:48,423 --> 00:23:49,264
How did I struggle

606
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,343
to raise you two?

607
00:23:50,423 --> 00:23:51,584
Have you forgotten?

608
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:52,863
Because of you,

609
00:23:52,943 --> 00:23:54,544
I couldn't go to work normally.

610
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,183
Every night,

611
00:23:55,263 --> 00:23:56,024
I made sandwiches

612
00:23:56,104 --> 00:23:56,944
after you fell asleep

613
00:23:57,024 --> 00:23:57,863
for sale the next day

614
00:23:57,943 --> 00:23:59,024
at the subway station.

615
00:23:59,144 --> 00:24:00,304
What did you just say?

616
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:01,944
You said Lili

617
00:24:02,024 --> 00:24:03,104
was nagging you?

618
00:24:03,423 --> 00:24:04,984
She's been supporting you

619
00:24:05,064 --> 00:24:06,423
with all her pension.

620
00:24:06,703 --> 00:24:08,623
When you were sick, she held you

621
00:24:08,703 --> 00:24:09,224
all night.

622
00:24:09,304 --> 00:24:10,224
Have you forgotten?

623
00:24:10,304 --> 00:24:11,623
I just want to have a dad.

624
00:24:11,703 --> 00:24:12,823
Everyone has a dad.

625
00:24:12,903 --> 00:24:13,744
- Why can't I?
- Why

626
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,903
didn't you tell me?

627
00:24:15,183 --> 00:24:16,584
Why are you seeing him in secret?

628
00:24:17,544 --> 00:24:18,663
If he truly loved you,

629
00:24:18,743 --> 00:24:20,503
would he have ignored you for two years?

630
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:22,703
You want to live with him?

631
00:24:22,864 --> 00:24:23,823
No problem.

632
00:24:23,903 --> 00:24:24,903
Listen, Qian Dami.

633
00:24:24,983 --> 00:24:25,663
I'll register him

634
00:24:25,743 --> 00:24:26,704
as your custodian.

635
00:24:26,784 --> 00:24:28,264
Go home with him tonight.

636
00:24:28,344 --> 00:24:29,623
Stop provoking me.

637
00:24:29,703 --> 00:24:30,704
Bring the agreement.

638
00:24:30,784 --> 00:24:31,383
I'll sign it

639
00:24:31,463 --> 00:24:32,583
and take the kids.

640
00:24:32,663 --> 00:24:34,183
Qian Dami is ungrateful.

641
00:24:34,263 --> 00:24:35,463
You can take her.

642
00:24:35,703 --> 00:24:36,983
But you can't take Xiaomi.

643
00:24:38,544 --> 00:24:40,263
You want custody of Xiaomi, huh?

644
00:24:41,344 --> 00:24:42,784
Give me half of the property.

645
00:24:42,903 --> 00:24:43,864
Then we'll talk.

646
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,143
Keep dreaming.

647
00:24:45,223 --> 00:24:46,304
Xu Kaixin, you...

648
00:24:47,423 --> 00:24:48,304
Mom.

649
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,143
Hello.

650
00:25:05,223 --> 00:25:06,224
Are you a dance teacher?

651
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,784
I'm Qian Dami's mom.

652
00:25:08,024 --> 00:25:09,744
I want to cancel her dance class.

653
00:25:09,824 --> 00:25:10,903
Hello, Ms. Wang.

654
00:25:10,983 --> 00:25:12,224
I'm Qian Dami's mom.

655
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:13,024
I'm canceling

656
00:25:13,104 --> 00:25:14,463
her English class.

657
00:25:14,624 --> 00:25:15,463
No.

658
00:25:15,663 --> 00:25:16,944
Not just this week.

659
00:25:17,024 --> 00:25:18,584
We'll not attend it again.

660
00:25:19,584 --> 00:25:20,384
Yeah.

661
00:25:31,584 --> 00:25:33,423
Dad, Mom doesn't want me anymore.

662
00:25:33,503 --> 00:25:35,223
Can I stay with you for a while?

663
00:25:42,183 --> 00:25:42,983
Sweetie.

664
00:25:43,344 --> 00:25:45,183
Mom is in a bad mood now.

665
00:25:45,263 --> 00:25:46,983
We shouldn't provoke her.

666
00:25:47,183 --> 00:25:48,744
You'd better go home today.

667
00:25:48,824 --> 00:25:49,663
Okay?

668
00:25:51,024 --> 00:25:52,263
I know.

669
00:25:52,344 --> 00:25:53,744
I still have to talk about custody

670
00:25:53,824 --> 00:25:55,183
with your mom.

671
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:55,983
Right?

672
00:25:56,384 --> 00:25:57,224
Once she calms down

673
00:25:57,304 --> 00:25:58,744
and feels better

674
00:25:58,824 --> 00:25:59,983
in a few days,

675
00:26:00,104 --> 00:26:01,264
I'll take you to my place.

676
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:01,984
Okay?

677
00:26:02,064 --> 00:26:03,824
I'll take you and Xiaomi out for food.

678
00:26:04,024 --> 00:26:04,824
Well...

679
00:26:05,663 --> 00:26:06,183
Okay?

680
00:26:06,263 --> 00:26:07,663
I don't want to wait that long.

681
00:26:07,743 --> 00:26:08,423
Very soon.

682
00:26:08,503 --> 00:26:09,864
I will speed things up.

683
00:26:10,183 --> 00:26:12,183
Just wait for a day or two, alright?

684
00:26:12,544 --> 00:26:13,624
Be good.

685
00:26:13,903 --> 00:26:15,144
- Okay?
- Alright.

686
00:26:15,864 --> 00:26:16,824
It's a deal then.

687
00:26:17,024 --> 00:26:17,743
Pinky swear.

688
00:26:18,024 --> 00:26:18,824
Pinky swear.

689
00:26:21,104 --> 00:26:22,224
Alright.

690
00:26:22,304 --> 00:26:23,304
Don't be sad.

691
00:26:23,384 --> 00:26:25,048
- Clean up a bit.
- My sweetie is upset.

692
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,423
Thank you, sweetie.

693
00:26:37,423 --> 00:26:38,223
Hello, Mom.

694
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,584
Things are tricky now.

695
00:26:41,743 --> 00:26:42,784
No, I mean

696
00:26:42,864 --> 00:26:44,583
people at work have been watching.

697
00:26:44,663 --> 00:26:46,343
I took too many days off last month.

698
00:26:46,423 --> 00:26:47,824
I need to do well at work.

699
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:49,464
I'll be late tonight.

700
00:26:49,544 --> 00:26:51,503
Could you pick up Yu'an and Yule?

701
00:26:51,584 --> 00:26:52,663
When will you be back?

702
00:26:52,743 --> 00:26:54,024
Your father-in-law, Youyou,

703
00:26:54,223 --> 00:26:55,103
and I will wait.

704
00:26:55,183 --> 00:26:55,704
Don't.

705
00:26:55,784 --> 00:26:57,183
I'll be back after 8 PM.

706
00:26:57,263 --> 00:26:58,224
You guys eat first.

707
00:26:58,304 --> 00:26:58,823
Alright.

708
00:26:58,903 --> 00:26:59,903
Try to be early.

709
00:26:59,983 --> 00:27:01,064
We need to talk.

710
00:27:01,183 --> 00:27:01,983
Talk later.

711
00:27:02,423 --> 00:27:03,064
Talk later.

712
00:27:03,144 --> 00:27:03,943
Talk later.

713
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:12,663
Qian Hao and Hu Xiaojiao

714
00:27:12,743 --> 00:27:13,744
were living abroad.

715
00:27:13,824 --> 00:27:15,384
Why did they suddenly come back?

716
00:27:15,544 --> 00:27:16,183
Do you remember

717
00:27:16,263 --> 00:27:17,663
how ruthless Qian Hao was?

718
00:27:17,743 --> 00:27:18,704
He said that

719
00:27:18,784 --> 00:27:20,503
Hu Xiaojiao was his true love

720
00:27:20,663 --> 00:27:21,464
and he didn't want

721
00:27:21,544 --> 00:27:23,223
either of our kids.

722
00:27:23,463 --> 00:27:24,784
But he suddenly came back.

723
00:27:24,864 --> 00:27:26,104
Why is that?

724
00:27:27,344 --> 00:27:28,944
From my years

725
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:30,503
as a remarriage matchmaker,

726
00:27:30,624 --> 00:27:32,024
there's only one answer.

727
00:27:32,983 --> 00:27:34,223
They can't have children.

728
00:27:35,144 --> 00:27:36,504
We just don't know

729
00:27:36,584 --> 00:27:37,304
if the problem

730
00:27:37,384 --> 00:27:39,064
lies in Qian Hao

731
00:27:39,144 --> 00:27:40,103
or Hu Xiaojiao.

732
00:27:40,183 --> 00:27:41,464
Qian Hao can't have the problem.

733
00:27:41,544 --> 00:27:42,224
Otherwise,

734
00:27:42,304 --> 00:27:43,263
how did we have kids?

735
00:27:43,864 --> 00:27:45,223
So Hu Xiaojiao has the problem.

736
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,223
Not necessarily.

737
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,183
What if the heavens did you justice

738
00:27:49,503 --> 00:27:50,903
by making Qian Hao injured

739
00:27:50,983 --> 00:27:52,464
in his private body part?

740
00:27:52,544 --> 00:27:53,703
Be serious.

741
00:27:54,263 --> 00:27:56,064
Did you really stop Dami's

742
00:27:56,263 --> 00:27:57,024
tutoring classes?

743
00:27:57,104 --> 00:27:57,903
Of course.

744
00:27:57,983 --> 00:28:00,223
Why should I keep being unappreciated?

745
00:28:00,943 --> 00:28:02,464
She's young and ignorant.

746
00:28:02,544 --> 00:28:03,863
She needs proper guidance.

747
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:04,984
Lili keeps talking about

748
00:28:05,064 --> 00:28:06,143
guidance every day.

749
00:28:06,223 --> 00:28:07,903
Haven't we guided her enough?

750
00:28:07,983 --> 00:28:09,344
In my opinion, real education

751
00:28:09,463 --> 00:28:10,304
requires parents

752
00:28:10,384 --> 00:28:11,784
to let their kids make mistakes.

753
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:12,984
Once she's hurt, she will

754
00:28:13,064 --> 00:28:14,423
distinguish right from wrong.

755
00:28:14,663 --> 00:28:15,423
I've decided.

756
00:28:15,503 --> 00:28:16,544
I will save the money

757
00:28:16,624 --> 00:28:17,304
and take care

758
00:28:17,384 --> 00:28:18,504
of myself properly.

759
00:28:18,584 --> 00:28:20,144
I will be carefree.

760
00:28:20,463 --> 00:28:21,944
If Qian Hao and Hu Xiaojiao

761
00:28:22,024 --> 00:28:22,944
really treat her well,

762
00:28:23,024 --> 00:28:23,984
then I will be happy

763
00:28:24,064 --> 00:28:25,263
for Qian Dami.

764
00:28:25,384 --> 00:28:26,264
Otherwise, she can

765
00:28:26,344 --> 00:28:27,304
always come home.

766
00:28:27,384 --> 00:28:28,903
I will have her back.

767
00:28:29,104 --> 00:28:30,304
Fair point.

768
00:28:31,263 --> 00:28:31,944
If you only

769
00:28:32,024 --> 00:28:33,703
have to keep Xiaomi,

770
00:28:33,864 --> 00:28:35,423
maybe you can find a partner easily.

771
00:28:35,624 --> 00:28:36,264
Why are you

772
00:28:36,344 --> 00:28:37,943
always thinking about that?

773
00:28:38,223 --> 00:28:40,264
As the best matchmaker for remarriage,

774
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:41,064
my ultimate goal

775
00:28:41,144 --> 00:28:43,104
is to get you remarried.

776
00:28:44,584 --> 00:28:45,423
To be honest,

777
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:47,064
you're an independent lady

778
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:48,544
in your thirties,

779
00:28:48,624 --> 00:28:50,024
who hasn't been married.

780
00:28:50,384 --> 00:28:52,263
Why are you running this business?

781
00:28:52,344 --> 00:28:53,544
You don't get it.

782
00:28:53,743 --> 00:28:55,423
All those who are divorced

783
00:28:55,503 --> 00:28:56,464
and have kids

784
00:28:56,544 --> 00:28:58,103
want reliable new partners.

785
00:28:58,183 --> 00:28:58,944
What does it mean?

786
00:28:59,024 --> 00:29:00,064
It means that

787
00:29:00,144 --> 00:29:01,544
I can succeed in this field.

788
00:29:02,544 --> 00:29:04,144
Doesn't that mean

789
00:29:04,263 --> 00:29:05,943
I'm in an advantageous position?

790
00:29:06,344 --> 00:29:07,583
Find a nice guy for me.

791
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:08,864
You know the standards.

792
00:29:09,864 --> 00:29:10,663
Be handsome.

793
00:29:10,864 --> 00:29:11,784
So superficial.

794
00:29:11,864 --> 00:29:13,263
You never learn.

795
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:15,064
Since they're all untrustworthy,

796
00:29:15,144 --> 00:29:16,624
I prefer the handsome ones.

797
00:29:16,943 --> 00:29:17,743
Alright.

798
00:29:18,463 --> 00:29:19,623
It seems that

799
00:29:19,703 --> 00:29:21,064
you're not angry anymore.

800
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,583
You distracted me.

801
00:29:22,663 --> 00:29:24,223
Now I feel much better.

802
00:29:25,064 --> 00:29:26,544
But then again,

803
00:29:26,824 --> 00:29:28,423
if Qian Hao and Hu Xiaojiao

804
00:29:28,503 --> 00:29:30,224
were really in it for the kids,

805
00:29:30,304 --> 00:29:31,504
they would shamelessly

806
00:29:31,584 --> 00:29:33,463
cling to you to get what they want.

807
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,143
I'm no longer the one who could
be easily tricked and bullied

808
00:29:36,223 --> 00:29:37,143
like I used to be.

809
00:29:37,223 --> 00:29:38,144
Listen.

810
00:29:38,304 --> 00:29:40,064
I treat my friends with sincerity.

811
00:29:40,423 --> 00:29:41,984
But I am ruthless with my enemies.

812
00:29:42,064 --> 00:29:44,304
They won't get away with it.

813
00:30:08,663 --> 00:30:09,463
Honey.

814
00:30:10,824 --> 00:30:12,663
- You're back.
- Honey, you're back.

815
00:30:13,104 --> 00:30:14,024
- You're...
- I am back.

816
00:30:15,544 --> 00:30:16,103
Alright.

817
00:30:16,183 --> 00:30:17,304
I miss you so much.

818
00:30:17,384 --> 00:30:18,624
Let me change my shoes.

819
00:30:19,344 --> 00:30:20,144
Honey.

820
00:30:20,304 --> 00:30:21,263
Tell you what.

821
00:30:21,824 --> 00:30:22,504
I bought

822
00:30:22,584 --> 00:30:24,464
an attractive nightgown.

823
00:30:24,544 --> 00:30:25,584
I'll put it on for you.

824
00:30:25,703 --> 00:30:26,463
Okay?

825
00:30:27,743 --> 00:30:28,544
Maybe another day.

826
00:30:28,983 --> 00:30:30,344
I'm a bit tired today.

827
00:30:32,503 --> 00:30:34,544
Why are you tired again?

828
00:30:35,703 --> 00:30:36,864
Come on.

829
00:30:37,943 --> 00:30:39,544
What's that smell in your hair?

830
00:30:39,703 --> 00:30:41,223
You had scrambled eggs with tomato?

831
00:30:42,544 --> 00:30:43,463
Don't get me started.

832
00:30:43,624 --> 00:30:44,264
Xu Kaixin

833
00:30:44,344 --> 00:30:45,743
poured tomato juice all over me.

834
00:30:47,344 --> 00:30:48,624
You saw Xu Kaixin?

835
00:30:49,064 --> 00:30:50,864
Why did she pour juice on you?

836
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,544
It was the parent-teacher meeting

837
00:30:53,624 --> 00:30:54,984
at Dami's school.

838
00:30:55,064 --> 00:30:56,024
I went there

839
00:30:56,384 --> 00:30:57,464
to bond with

840
00:30:57,544 --> 00:30:58,583
my daughter.

841
00:30:58,663 --> 00:31:00,663
But Xu Kaixin saw me

842
00:31:00,743 --> 00:31:01,824
and made a scene.

843
00:31:02,584 --> 00:31:04,903
How did she become like this?

844
00:31:06,304 --> 00:31:07,624
Are you okay, honey?

845
00:31:07,864 --> 00:31:08,663
I'm fine.

846
00:31:08,983 --> 00:31:10,583
I washed my hair at a barber shop

847
00:31:10,663 --> 00:31:11,304
nearby.

848
00:31:11,384 --> 00:31:12,824
Otherwise, it'd be awful.

849
00:31:13,544 --> 00:31:14,663
You still smell.

850
00:31:16,344 --> 00:31:17,663
You have no idea how much

851
00:31:17,864 --> 00:31:18,504
she has changed.

852
00:31:18,584 --> 00:31:19,423
She has become

853
00:31:20,183 --> 00:31:22,144
somewhat unreasonable.

854
00:31:23,144 --> 00:31:24,383
I think it will be difficult

855
00:31:24,463 --> 00:31:26,304
to get custody of Xiaomi

856
00:31:27,223 --> 00:31:28,304
from her.

857
00:31:30,423 --> 00:31:31,864
What should we do?

858
00:31:33,903 --> 00:31:34,864
I have no idea.

859
00:31:35,824 --> 00:31:37,344
I divorced Xu Kaixin

860
00:31:37,584 --> 00:31:39,144
before Xiaomi was born.

861
00:31:40,104 --> 00:31:40,663
Xiaomi and I

862
00:31:40,743 --> 00:31:42,064
haven't bonded at all.

863
00:31:42,703 --> 00:31:45,064
I wanted to get in touch with him

864
00:31:45,663 --> 00:31:47,104
through Dami.

865
00:31:47,423 --> 00:31:49,263
But Xu Kaixin found out about it.

866
00:31:50,104 --> 00:31:51,423
It's quite impossible now.

867
00:31:53,784 --> 00:31:55,223
Dami wants to live with us.

868
00:31:56,384 --> 00:31:58,743
But my mom wants a grandson.

869
00:32:01,903 --> 00:32:03,103
Kaixin is careless

870
00:32:03,183 --> 00:32:04,064
and easy to coax.

871
00:32:04,384 --> 00:32:07,104
Let's think of something else.

872
00:32:07,304 --> 00:32:08,224
Didn't I tell you?

873
00:32:08,304 --> 00:32:09,224
She has changed.

874
00:32:09,304 --> 00:32:10,863
She has changed a lot.

875
00:32:10,943 --> 00:32:11,944
You know, I asked

876
00:32:12,024 --> 00:32:12,944
for Dami's custody.

877
00:32:13,024 --> 00:32:14,183
She asked me to trade

878
00:32:14,263 --> 00:32:15,703
with half of the property.

879
00:32:15,903 --> 00:32:17,103
That's her plan?

880
00:32:17,183 --> 00:32:18,304
Exactly.

881
00:32:20,064 --> 00:32:20,983
Listen, honey.

882
00:32:21,104 --> 00:32:21,903
How about this?

883
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:23,383
Don't bother with her.

884
00:32:23,463 --> 00:32:25,503
Let's go to the sperm bank

885
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:26,503
and do IVF.

886
00:32:27,144 --> 00:32:28,304
I will give birth.

887
00:32:28,384 --> 00:32:29,704
They won't suspect a thing.

888
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:30,944
Nobody would know you...

889
00:32:31,024 --> 00:32:32,423
Are you kidding me?

890
00:32:33,223 --> 00:32:34,663
I have a son.

891
00:32:34,983 --> 00:32:36,624
I won't raise someone else's son.

892
00:32:37,024 --> 00:32:38,143
I'll get Xiaomi's custody

893
00:32:38,223 --> 00:32:39,423
no matter what.

894
00:32:39,503 --> 00:32:40,784
I support you, honey.

895
00:32:42,104 --> 00:32:42,903
How about this?

896
00:32:43,703 --> 00:32:45,183
I'll change into that gown.

897
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:46,304
We'll give it a try.

898
00:32:48,223 --> 00:32:49,104
I need a shower.

899
00:32:51,304 --> 00:32:52,903
We haven't been intimate for a month.

900
00:32:52,983 --> 00:32:53,704
How are we

901
00:32:53,784 --> 00:32:55,304
going to live like this?

902
00:32:56,503 --> 00:32:57,304
Let go.

903
00:32:57,384 --> 00:32:58,704
Don't grab my tie. Let go.

904
00:32:58,784 --> 00:32:59,544
Honey.

905
00:32:59,624 --> 00:33:00,504
Got it.

906
00:33:00,584 --> 00:33:01,663
Got it.

907
00:33:02,064 --> 00:33:03,064
I have something to do.

908
00:33:03,144 --> 00:33:04,120
Please respect yourself.

909
00:33:05,183 --> 00:33:06,584
Qian Hao, you...

910
00:33:13,423 --> 00:33:14,223
Mom.

911
00:33:14,482 --> 00:33:15,022
Hi!

912
00:33:15,423 --> 00:33:16,263
You're back.

913
00:33:17,024 --> 00:33:18,144
- Mom.
- Are you a good boy?

914
00:33:29,663 --> 00:33:30,824
What happened?

915
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,703
A bad guy came to steal

916
00:33:33,983 --> 00:33:35,183
my achievement.

917
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:36,264
What do you mean?

918
00:33:36,344 --> 00:33:37,384
Qian Hao is back

919
00:33:37,544 --> 00:33:38,823
to get custody of the kids.

920
00:33:38,903 --> 00:33:39,703
What?

921
00:33:39,983 --> 00:33:40,704
Qian Hao?

922
00:33:40,784 --> 00:33:41,544
How dare he?

923
00:33:41,624 --> 00:33:43,064
I'll break his legs!

924
00:33:43,784 --> 00:33:45,143
Don't talk about my dad like that!

925
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:45,944
Otherwise,

926
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,064
I'll run away from home.

927
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,103
Dami.

928
00:33:53,183 --> 00:33:54,024
Here.

929
00:33:56,864 --> 00:33:57,824
Take it.

930
00:35:01,464 --> 00:35:01,984
Come on.

931
00:35:02,303 --> 00:35:02,944
Don't run.

932
00:35:03,024 --> 00:35:04,303
Hurry.

933
00:35:06,383 --> 00:35:07,183
No more circles.

934
00:35:07,303 --> 00:35:08,464
The eagle is coming!

935
00:35:08,743 --> 00:35:09,303
Hurry.

936
00:35:09,663 --> 00:35:10,464
Faster.

937
00:35:10,544 --> 00:35:11,303
Caught you.

938
00:35:11,424 --> 00:35:12,263
Caught you.

939
00:35:12,863 --> 00:35:13,583
I'm done.

940
00:35:13,663 --> 00:35:14,864
- Grandpa...
- I'm tired.

941
00:35:14,944 --> 00:35:15,904
Grandpa is tired.

942
00:35:15,984 --> 00:35:17,143
Alright, that's enough.

943
00:35:17,223 --> 00:35:17,944
Play on your own.

944
00:35:18,223 --> 00:35:19,183
Grandpa is tired.

945
00:35:19,823 --> 00:35:20,703
I can't run anymore.

946
00:35:22,624 --> 00:35:23,703
These two kids...

947
00:35:24,504 --> 00:35:25,504
Slow down.

948
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:26,343
Youyou.

949
00:35:26,823 --> 00:35:27,504
Youyou.

950
00:35:28,144 --> 00:35:30,263
Come on, watch the kids.

951
00:35:31,263 --> 00:35:32,104
It's exhausting.

952
00:35:32,544 --> 00:35:33,464
Sir,

953
00:35:33,863 --> 00:35:35,783
it's no longer work hours.

954
00:35:36,223 --> 00:35:38,183
You have to pay me for overtime.

955
00:35:38,544 --> 00:35:39,383
What did you say?

956
00:35:39,863 --> 00:35:41,104
Pay you for overtime?

957
00:35:42,064 --> 00:35:44,223
I asked you to keep the kids company.

958
00:35:44,303 --> 00:35:45,703
And you want overtime fees?

959
00:35:45,783 --> 00:35:47,223
Stop whining. Come out.

960
00:35:47,303 --> 00:35:49,104
You'll have to pay me first.

961
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:53,584
Seriously.

962
00:35:59,263 --> 00:36:00,104
Alright.

963
00:36:00,703 --> 00:36:02,104
I made the transfer.

964
00:36:03,624 --> 00:36:04,504
Thanks, Dad.

965
00:36:05,223 --> 00:36:06,143
It's all about money.

966
00:36:06,223 --> 00:36:07,263
Yu'an, Yule, come here.

967
00:36:07,343 --> 00:36:08,703
Come and play.

968
00:36:08,944 --> 00:36:09,864
Let's watch cartoons.

969
00:36:09,944 --> 00:36:10,703
Okay?

970
00:36:10,783 --> 00:36:11,584
Okay.

971
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,984
What should we watch?

972
00:36:14,064 --> 00:36:14,743
Anything is fine.

973
00:36:14,823 --> 00:36:15,623
I didn't ask you

974
00:36:15,703 --> 00:36:17,383
to watch cartoons with them.

975
00:36:17,904 --> 00:36:19,504
I know how to turn on the TV.

976
00:36:20,104 --> 00:36:21,183
We need to protect

977
00:36:21,263 --> 00:36:22,263
their eyesight.

978
00:36:23,743 --> 00:36:25,703
- Grandpa, don't be mad.
- Grandpa, don't be mad.

979
00:36:28,223 --> 00:36:29,064
Mom, Dad.

980
00:36:32,464 --> 00:36:33,464
Chengyi is back.

981
00:36:49,984 --> 00:36:51,064
Don't get burned.

982
00:36:56,104 --> 00:36:57,343
Does it taste fine?

983
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:00,584
It's nice, Dad.

984
00:37:01,024 --> 00:37:01,823
That's good.

985
00:37:03,743 --> 00:37:04,504
Chengyi.

986
00:37:04,584 --> 00:37:06,104
We called you here

987
00:37:07,223 --> 00:37:08,743
because your mother-in-law and I

988
00:37:08,904 --> 00:37:10,504
want to talk to you about something.

989
00:37:12,024 --> 00:37:12,823
Alright.

990
00:37:12,944 --> 00:37:13,783
Mom, Dad, go ahead.

991
00:37:14,223 --> 00:37:15,024
Okay.

992
00:37:15,783 --> 00:37:16,783
Xinxin

993
00:37:17,383 --> 00:37:18,703
has been gone for years.

994
00:37:19,064 --> 00:37:19,703
And you

995
00:37:19,783 --> 00:37:21,504
have been single for years.

996
00:37:21,584 --> 00:37:22,504
We know you are

997
00:37:22,584 --> 00:37:23,864
deeply in love with Xinxin.

998
00:37:23,944 --> 00:37:25,504
And we really

999
00:37:25,584 --> 00:37:26,783
appreciate it.

1000
00:37:27,064 --> 00:37:27,864
Honestly.

1001
00:37:27,944 --> 00:37:29,103
Your mother-in-law and I

1002
00:37:29,183 --> 00:37:30,703
feel a bit sorry

1003
00:37:31,024 --> 00:37:31,783
for you.

1004
00:37:31,863 --> 00:37:33,623
- Don't...
- Yeah. Just continue.

1005
00:37:33,703 --> 00:37:36,104
You have to move on sooner or later.

1006
00:37:36,424 --> 00:37:37,303
In my opinion,

1007
00:37:37,383 --> 00:37:39,064
give it a try with Youyou.

1008
00:37:40,904 --> 00:37:41,464
Slow down.

1009
00:37:41,544 --> 00:37:42,143
No rush.

1010
00:37:42,223 --> 00:37:42,743
Slow down.

1011
00:37:42,823 --> 00:37:43,984
Slow down.

1012
00:37:44,104 --> 00:37:45,303
Take it easy.

1013
00:37:45,424 --> 00:37:46,064
Slow down.

1014
00:37:46,144 --> 00:37:47,064
I'm okay, Mom.

1015
00:37:48,303 --> 00:37:49,064
Chengyi.

1016
00:37:49,343 --> 00:37:50,303
Have you been

1017
00:37:51,024 --> 00:37:52,624
looking to get remarried?

1018
00:37:57,584 --> 00:37:58,343
True.

1019
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:00,223
I have thought about it.

1020
00:38:00,944 --> 00:38:01,864
You know,

1021
00:38:01,944 --> 00:38:03,623
it's hard to raise two kids

1022
00:38:03,703 --> 00:38:04,904
at the same time on my own.

1023
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:06,223
It's really difficult.

1024
00:38:06,303 --> 00:38:07,783
What do you think of me?

1025
00:38:09,183 --> 00:38:10,303
So serious?

1026
00:38:12,424 --> 00:38:13,343
Alright.

1027
00:38:13,863 --> 00:38:14,624
You're nice.

1028
00:38:17,303 --> 00:38:18,144
As a wife?

1029
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,583
Look.

1030
00:38:20,663 --> 00:38:22,343
Don't let the benefits go to outsiders.

1031
00:38:22,823 --> 00:38:24,344
Youyou just returned from abroad.

1032
00:38:24,424 --> 00:38:25,864
You two know each other well.

1033
00:38:25,944 --> 00:38:28,024
So you understand and trust each other.

1034
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:28,864
That's right.

1035
00:38:28,944 --> 00:38:29,663
Wait.

1036
00:38:29,743 --> 00:38:30,384
Of course.

1037
00:38:30,464 --> 00:38:31,424
We know that you can't

1038
00:38:31,504 --> 00:38:32,703
wrap your head around it

1039
00:38:32,783 --> 00:38:34,544
in such a short time.

1040
00:38:34,624 --> 00:38:35,504
It's okay.

1041
00:38:36,303 --> 00:38:37,183
Leave it to time.

1042
00:38:37,263 --> 00:38:38,944
Time can fix everything.

1043
00:38:39,263 --> 00:38:41,024
But let me analyze it for you.

1044
00:38:41,703 --> 00:38:43,144
There are many advantages

1045
00:38:43,383 --> 00:38:44,823
for you to marry Youyou.

1046
00:38:45,343 --> 00:38:46,223
She will tell you

1047
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:47,383
the details.

1048
00:38:47,584 --> 00:38:48,464
Listen.

1049
00:38:48,544 --> 00:38:49,984
I have a lot of problems.

1050
00:38:50,144 --> 00:38:51,464
In the past two years,

1051
00:38:51,544 --> 00:38:53,904
I've done nothing but have fun abroad.

1052
00:38:53,984 --> 00:38:55,064
Now, I'm back.

1053
00:38:55,144 --> 00:38:56,263
I'm not planning

1054
00:38:56,343 --> 00:38:57,663
to get a decent job yet.

1055
00:38:58,064 --> 00:38:58,944
I've always

1056
00:38:59,624 --> 00:39:02,103
been lazy and hot-tempered.

1057
00:39:02,183 --> 00:39:03,703
I only want to enjoy life.

1058
00:39:04,544 --> 00:39:05,544
She will be

1059
00:39:05,624 --> 00:39:06,504
a great stepmother

1060
00:39:06,584 --> 00:39:07,544
for our grandchildren.

1061
00:39:07,624 --> 00:39:08,223
Exactly.

1062
00:39:08,303 --> 00:39:08,864
Also,

1063
00:39:08,944 --> 00:39:10,783
Youyou keeps saying

1064
00:39:10,863 --> 00:39:12,303
that she won't have kids.

1065
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:13,544
If you get married,

1066
00:39:13,624 --> 00:39:15,624
it's a win-win for both of you.

1067
00:39:15,944 --> 00:39:18,823
The supply and demand reach a balance.

1068
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:20,783
Anyway,

1069
00:39:20,863 --> 00:39:22,464
my parents don't need me to make money.

1070
00:39:22,544 --> 00:39:24,383
I'm going to live off them.

1071
00:39:25,104 --> 00:39:27,024
You know, your mother-in-law and I

1072
00:39:27,104 --> 00:39:28,263
have plenty of money.

1073
00:39:28,424 --> 00:39:29,064
Yeah.

1074
00:39:29,144 --> 00:39:31,303
With the housing relocation
compensation,

1075
00:39:31,383 --> 00:39:32,864
we bought several houses

1076
00:39:32,944 --> 00:39:34,743
and have been living off rental income.

1077
00:39:34,823 --> 00:39:36,064
But to be honest,

1078
00:39:36,464 --> 00:39:38,504
if you marry an outsider,

1079
00:39:38,904 --> 00:39:40,064
I don't feel reassured

1080
00:39:40,144 --> 00:39:41,703
about leaving the money

1081
00:39:42,303 --> 00:39:43,984
to Yu'an and Yule.

1082
00:39:44,624 --> 00:39:46,103
But then again,

1083
00:39:46,183 --> 00:39:48,743
if you marry Youyou,

1084
00:39:49,544 --> 00:39:51,623
the money will be all yours.

1085
00:39:51,703 --> 00:39:53,504
Isn't this a win-win situation?

1086
00:40:01,183 --> 00:40:02,743
First, my sister. Now, it's me?

1087
00:40:02,904 --> 00:40:04,143
Are you preying on us?

1088
00:40:04,223 --> 00:40:05,863
Wait.

1089
00:40:06,064 --> 00:40:06,783
Youyou.

1090
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:07,904
Calm down.

1091
00:40:07,984 --> 00:40:08,703
Alright?

1092
00:40:08,904 --> 00:40:10,944
When did I ever say I liked you?

1093
00:40:11,104 --> 00:40:11,824
Have I ever shown

1094
00:40:11,904 --> 00:40:13,504
too much attention to you,

1095
00:40:13,584 --> 00:40:14,663
which confused you?

1096
00:40:15,703 --> 00:40:17,783
I'm preying on you?

1097
00:40:19,144 --> 00:40:19,944
Yeah.

1098
00:40:20,424 --> 00:40:21,824
Your parents gave Yu'an and Yule

1099
00:40:21,904 --> 00:40:22,504
some money.

1100
00:40:22,584 --> 00:40:24,783
But those were just red envelopes.

1101
00:40:25,944 --> 00:40:27,583
Since we know each other so well,

1102
00:40:27,663 --> 00:40:28,583
I'll just

1103
00:40:28,663 --> 00:40:29,623
speak my mind.

1104
00:40:29,703 --> 00:40:30,223
Anyway,

1105
00:40:30,303 --> 00:40:31,623
you have a clear understanding

1106
00:40:31,703 --> 00:40:32,944
of yourself.

1107
00:40:33,424 --> 00:40:35,783
Lazy, hot-tempered, narcissistic,

1108
00:40:35,863 --> 00:40:37,104
and living off your parents.

1109
00:40:37,303 --> 00:40:39,064
Have you ever looked in the mirror?

1110
00:40:39,464 --> 00:40:40,263
You're like...

1111
00:40:40,544 --> 00:40:41,343
What...

1112
00:40:41,464 --> 00:40:42,263
Why?

1113
00:40:42,504 --> 00:40:43,743
Why would I like you?

1114
00:40:48,944 --> 00:40:49,703
You

1115
00:40:51,183 --> 00:40:52,343
really don't like me?

1116
00:40:53,624 --> 00:40:55,464
You're the last woman I'd marry.

1117
00:40:55,584 --> 00:40:56,383
Alright.

1118
00:40:57,064 --> 00:40:58,904
That puts my mind at ease.

1119
00:40:59,064 --> 00:41:00,663
As long as you refuse to marry me,

1120
00:41:00,904 --> 00:41:02,703
you'll still be my good brother-in-law.

1121
00:41:03,904 --> 00:41:05,104
I recorded it.

1122
00:41:05,303 --> 00:41:06,584
Don't go back on your word.

1123
00:41:06,703 --> 00:41:07,703
I'm off.

1124
00:41:07,984 --> 00:41:08,863
See you around.

1125
00:41:16,783 --> 00:41:18,504
Did she forget to take her medicine?

1126
00:41:21,183 --> 00:41:22,183
Mom, Dad.

1127
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,263
It's alright.

1128
00:41:25,584 --> 00:41:26,703
We can talk it through.

1129
00:41:26,783 --> 00:41:28,623
- We can solve everything.
- Yeah.

1130
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:29,783
Go ahead.

1131
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:32,823
There is something

1132
00:41:33,544 --> 00:41:35,223
I haven't told you yet.

1133
00:41:35,504 --> 00:41:36,223
It's alright.

1134
00:41:36,303 --> 00:41:37,464
Go ahead.

1135
00:41:39,024 --> 00:41:40,864
Well, I have a girlfriend.

1136
00:41:40,944 --> 00:41:41,743
That's fine.

1137
00:41:41,823 --> 00:41:42,544
Well...

1138
00:41:45,863 --> 00:41:46,663
Y-You...

1139
00:41:47,263 --> 00:41:48,104
What did you say?

1140
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:49,223
I said

1141
00:41:49,303 --> 00:41:50,863
I have a girlfriend.

1142
00:41:50,944 --> 00:41:51,984
So I can't possibly

1143
00:41:52,064 --> 00:41:52,823
marry Youyou.

1144
00:41:53,104 --> 00:41:54,663
So Mom, Dad.

1145
00:41:55,024 --> 00:41:56,223
Sorry about that.

1146
00:41:56,823 --> 00:41:57,624
Sorry.

1147
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,263
Great noodles.

1148
00:42:16,944 --> 00:42:17,823
That was awesome.

1149
