The person sitting in front of you now

17
00:01:44,245 --> 00:01:46,485
is someone with a hidden identity.

18
00:01:47,886 --> 00:01:49,006
What identity?

19
00:01:49,926 --> 00:01:51,405
The owner of a parenting group.

20
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:52,845
Oh my god.

21
00:01:53,125 --> 00:01:54,405
You are a pro.

22
00:01:54,526 --> 00:01:56,125
A man who raised two little girls

23
00:01:56,205 --> 00:01:57,205
to this age

24
00:01:57,685 --> 00:01:59,045
must have some skills.

25
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:00,605
Well,

26
00:02:00,685 --> 00:02:01,367
I have collected

27
00:02:01,447 --> 00:02:03,366
many people's opinions in the group.

28
00:02:03,485 --> 00:02:04,206
I think

29
00:02:04,286 --> 00:02:04,965
we can try...

30
00:02:05,045 --> 00:02:05,846
Mr. Group Owner,

31
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:07,086
may I interrupt?

32
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:08,166
Yes.

33
00:02:08,246 --> 00:02:09,246
Here's the thing.

34
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:11,486
My private bakery

35
00:02:11,566 --> 00:02:12,525
was actually

36
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:13,725
started for

37
00:02:13,805 --> 00:02:14,766
my two kids.

38
00:02:14,846 --> 00:02:15,606
Then it

39
00:02:15,686 --> 00:02:16,406
got famous.

40
00:02:16,486 --> 00:02:17,965
Many moms came to order from me.

41
00:02:18,045 --> 00:02:19,326
My customer base grew larger.

42
00:02:19,406 --> 00:02:20,207
So recently,

43
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:22,326
I planned to open a storefront

44
00:02:22,406 --> 00:02:23,805
near the school gate.

45
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:24,966
Can you promote

46
00:02:25,046 --> 00:02:26,245
for me in the group?

47
00:02:26,325 --> 00:02:28,245
I want to do a free giveaway.

48
00:02:28,325 --> 00:02:28,927
It could

49
00:02:29,007 --> 00:02:30,125
expand my business.

50
00:02:30,205 --> 00:02:31,446
What do you think?

51
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:32,966
Xu Kaixin,

52
00:02:33,726 --> 00:02:34,566
I use this group

53
00:02:34,646 --> 00:02:35,926
to help solve our problems.

54
00:02:36,006 --> 00:02:37,245
But you want to advertise here.

55
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:38,207
If you don't agree,

56
00:02:38,287 --> 00:02:39,845
I'll also take back the first term.

57
00:02:39,925 --> 00:02:41,446
I demand double the times.

58
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,166
Alright, post whatever you want.

59
00:02:47,246 --> 00:02:48,246
Thanks.

60
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:50,206
Back to the topic,

61
00:02:50,286 --> 00:02:51,047
in my group,

62
00:02:51,127 --> 00:02:52,605
there is a childcare expert.

63
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:53,646
He said,

64
00:02:53,726 --> 00:02:54,965
a combination of two plus two

65
00:02:55,045 --> 00:02:56,125
cannot be rushed

66
00:02:56,205 --> 00:02:57,286
to integrate.

67
00:02:58,205 --> 00:02:59,326
Kids nowadays are all

68
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:00,366
a bit rebellious.

69
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:01,886
We can't see ourselves

70
00:03:02,045 --> 00:03:03,846
as just their parents.

71
00:03:04,525 --> 00:03:05,805
We can see them as a small class

72
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:07,205
with us as administrators,

73
00:03:07,446 --> 00:03:08,405
a chief

74
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:09,566
and a deputy.

75
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:11,326
We can't force them to merge.

76
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:12,167
Our kids

77
00:03:12,247 --> 00:03:14,006
are curious about each other.

78
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:15,486
They want to be together more

79
00:03:15,566 --> 00:03:16,566
as we forbid them.

80
00:03:16,686 --> 00:03:18,206
That seems to make sense.

81
00:03:18,286 --> 00:03:19,406
We can try it.

82
00:03:19,925 --> 00:03:21,045
Alright, the last question.

83
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:23,485
About life?

84
00:03:24,006 --> 00:03:25,046
I think there is nothing

85
00:03:25,126 --> 00:03:26,205
wrong with your life.

86
00:03:26,805 --> 00:03:27,725
I just hope

87
00:03:27,805 --> 00:03:29,766
we can first love our small families

88
00:03:29,846 --> 00:03:30,726
and then

89
00:03:30,806 --> 00:03:32,166
the big family we built together.

90
00:03:33,645 --> 00:03:34,405
The contract term.

91
00:03:34,485 --> 00:03:35,285
Renewed annually.

92
00:03:35,365 --> 00:03:36,486
If the cooperation works,

93
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:38,166
we can renew indefinitely.

94
00:03:41,045 --> 00:03:42,166
Ms. Xu Kaixin,

95
00:03:42,645 --> 00:03:43,645
nice to work with you.

96
00:03:44,765 --> 00:03:45,805
Mr. Mei Chengyi,

97
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:47,566
nice to work with you.

98
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:48,285
Slow down.

99
00:03:48,365 --> 00:03:48,767
I'm sorry.

100
00:03:48,847 --> 00:03:50,285
Sorry, I forgot.

101
00:03:50,365 --> 00:03:51,285
Sorry.

102
00:03:51,365 --> 00:03:51,886
I'm sorry.

103
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:52,887
Sorry, I forgot.

104
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:55,166
Are you trying to murder me?

105
00:03:59,422 --> 00:04:01,016
(Safety Education)

106
00:04:01,126 --> 00:04:02,126
Dad.

107
00:04:02,805 --> 00:04:03,805
Thank you, ma'am.

108
00:04:04,205 --> 00:04:05,246
Did you miss me?

109
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:07,845
Dad, did you come

110
00:04:07,925 --> 00:04:09,245
to see me because you missed me?

111
00:04:09,325 --> 00:04:10,325
Of course.

112
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:13,686
Well.

113
00:04:16,085 --> 00:04:17,046
I happen

114
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:18,406
to have 200 yuan.

115
00:04:18,486 --> 00:04:19,167
Take it.

116
00:04:19,247 --> 00:04:20,205
Buy whatever

117
00:04:20,285 --> 00:04:21,446
you want to eat or buy, okay?

118
00:04:22,126 --> 00:04:23,405
Okay, thank you, Dad.

119
00:04:23,686 --> 00:04:24,686
How is Grandma?

120
00:04:25,806 --> 00:04:27,165
Grandma is fine.

121
00:04:28,405 --> 00:04:29,726
Did you guys move?

122
00:04:29,806 --> 00:04:30,367
Yes.

123
00:04:30,447 --> 00:04:31,926
We moved next to Mr. Mei.

124
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:33,285
He's my mom's boyfriend.

125
00:04:36,965 --> 00:04:38,046
Where is your new address?

126
00:04:38,126 --> 00:04:39,166
Tell me.

127
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:39,807
I'll send you

128
00:04:39,887 --> 00:04:41,366
some gifts or something.

129
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:42,445
Later, I'll take you

130
00:04:42,525 --> 00:04:43,525
and Xiaomi out to play.

131
00:04:43,886 --> 00:04:45,085
Sorry, Dad,

132
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,167
I promised Mom

133
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:47,285
not to betray her.

134
00:04:47,486 --> 00:04:49,165
Kids also need to keep their promises.

135
00:04:51,606 --> 00:04:52,606
Dami,

136
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:53,487
listen to me.

137
00:04:53,567 --> 00:04:54,606
I'm not going to...

138
00:04:54,686 --> 00:04:55,126
Dad,

139
00:04:55,206 --> 00:04:57,366
take the money back.

140
00:04:57,765 --> 00:04:58,487
Buy Grandma

141
00:04:58,567 --> 00:05:00,165
some nutritional supplements.

142
00:05:00,285 --> 00:05:01,005
I have class.

143
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:01,886
I'm leaving.

144
00:05:02,085 --> 00:05:03,165
Wait, Dami, I...

145
00:05:03,606 --> 00:05:04,606
Dami.

146
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:07,205
Dami.

147
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:21,405
Think about it.

148
00:05:22,006 --> 00:05:24,085
Could it be that Youyou works there

149
00:05:24,566 --> 00:05:26,046
because she thinks

150
00:05:26,525 --> 00:05:28,006
there is beautiful scenery

151
00:05:28,165 --> 00:05:29,405
and fresh air?

152
00:05:29,765 --> 00:05:32,246
Beautiful scenery? Fresh air?

153
00:05:32,486 --> 00:05:33,366
Why isn't it a zoo

154
00:05:33,446 --> 00:05:34,446
or a botanical garden?

155
00:05:35,686 --> 00:05:36,686
What?

156
00:05:37,246 --> 00:05:39,205
You started it but can't finish it?

157
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:41,366
Seeing Youyou mad at you,

158
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:42,886
you immediately surrender?

159
00:05:44,525 --> 00:05:45,206
She is

160
00:05:45,286 --> 00:05:46,645
a well-educated young woman

161
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:49,085
who studied abroad at the cost
of a lot of money.

162
00:05:49,926 --> 00:05:51,366
If relatives and friends ask

163
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:52,606
where she is working,

164
00:05:53,325 --> 00:05:54,126
what should we say?

165
00:05:54,325 --> 00:05:56,525
What if Youyou insists on staying there,

166
00:05:57,046 --> 00:05:58,765
even if she has to starve?

167
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:01,565
Okay, I'll support her.

168
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:02,806
As long as she persists,

169
00:06:02,886 --> 00:06:03,686
I will immediately

170
00:06:03,766 --> 00:06:04,965
become her first new customer.

171
00:07:00,006 --> 00:07:01,165
This is not bad.

172
00:07:01,246 --> 00:07:02,325
Let's take a break.

173
00:07:09,285 --> 00:07:11,765
To be honest, this place is quite nice.

174
00:07:12,525 --> 00:07:13,565
We did the right thing

175
00:07:13,645 --> 00:07:15,566
to bury Xin here back then.

176
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:20,285
Join here if you like.

177
00:07:22,165 --> 00:07:23,886
Isn't what you're saying nonsense?

178
00:07:24,686 --> 00:07:26,965
Sooner or later, we'll both join her.

179
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:29,685
How much longer

180
00:07:29,765 --> 00:07:31,566
will your menopause last?

181
00:07:33,525 --> 00:07:34,765
Pot-stirrer.

182
00:07:35,046 --> 00:07:36,325
I'm the pot-stirrer?

183
00:07:37,486 --> 00:07:38,407
I'm the big stirrer.

184
00:07:38,487 --> 00:07:39,566
You're the small stirrer.

185
00:07:40,006 --> 00:07:41,405
We're both guilty here.

186
00:08:12,165 --> 00:08:13,285
Why stop playing?

187
00:08:15,006 --> 00:08:16,165
I'm glad it stopped.

188
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:17,886
It gave me a headache.

189
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,126
You have no taste.

190
00:08:30,046 --> 00:08:31,325
The barking is weird.

191
00:08:52,285 --> 00:08:53,246
Hello, your delivery.

192
00:08:53,326 --> 00:08:54,445
Thank you.

193
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:55,445
Five stars for you.

194
00:08:55,525 --> 00:08:56,886
Thank you.

195
00:09:28,285 --> 00:09:29,167
Master,

196
00:09:29,247 --> 00:09:30,366
what are you doing?

197
00:09:30,525 --> 00:09:32,046
Get online and play a few rounds.

198
00:09:32,126 --> 00:09:33,285
I will carry you.

199
00:10:02,738 --> 00:10:04,376
(Yongshou Cemetery)

200
00:10:27,846 --> 00:10:28,925
Hello, who is this?

201
00:10:29,246 --> 00:10:30,366
Hello, is this Youyou?

202
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:33,366
This is her. And you are?

203
00:10:34,445 --> 00:10:35,565
I oversee public cemeteries

204
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:37,165
in the Civil Affairs Bureau.

205
00:10:37,366 --> 00:10:39,006
Your personal leave is almost timed up.

206
00:10:39,086 --> 00:10:40,006
The cemetery

207
00:10:40,086 --> 00:10:40,726
is short-handed.

208
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,086
Can you return to your post now?

209
00:10:43,006 --> 00:10:45,165
Didn't my master tell you?

210
00:10:45,246 --> 00:10:46,007
I mean Hu Pei.

211
00:10:46,087 --> 00:10:47,165
He is my master.

212
00:10:48,006 --> 00:10:49,445
Hu Pei is ill and hospitalized.

213
00:10:49,525 --> 00:10:51,166
That's why we're shorthanded now.

214
00:10:51,246 --> 00:10:52,606
The cemetery mustn't lack staff.

215
00:10:54,765 --> 00:10:56,886
Okay, I'll return immediately.

216
00:10:57,805 --> 00:10:58,966
Okay, that's good.

217
00:10:59,086 --> 00:11:00,565
We won't make any other arrangements.

218
00:11:00,645 --> 00:11:02,086
Otherwise, we'll have to recruit.

219
00:11:02,886 --> 00:11:04,405
Sorry, may I ask,

220
00:11:04,685 --> 00:11:06,126
what happened to my master?

221
00:11:06,326 --> 00:11:07,685
His health has always been good.

222
00:11:07,765 --> 00:11:09,366
He even does Baduanjin and such.

223
00:11:09,606 --> 00:11:11,006
It shouldn't be so sudden.

224
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:13,926
I don't know the specifics.

225
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:14,287
Okay.

226
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:15,726
Return to your post.

227
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:17,925
Okay.

228
00:11:36,318 --> 00:11:40,184
(Yongshou Cemetery)

229
00:12:01,246 --> 00:12:02,246
Dami.

230
00:12:04,445 --> 00:12:05,445
(Harbor Primary School)
Lili.

231
00:12:05,726 --> 00:12:06,765
How's school?

232
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:07,606
Quite good.

233
00:12:07,686 --> 00:12:09,326
But my dad came.

234
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,966
Why did he come?

235
00:12:11,685 --> 00:12:13,766
First, he gave me 200 yuan.

236
00:12:13,846 --> 00:12:15,445
Then he asked if we moved

237
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:16,525
and where we moved to.

238
00:12:17,246 --> 00:12:18,646
Did you say anything wrong?

239
00:12:18,726 --> 00:12:19,445
No.

240
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:21,646
I'm not like Xiaomi, that little fool.

241
00:12:21,726 --> 00:12:22,886
I can resist temptation.

242
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:24,126
I threw the money back at him

243
00:12:24,206 --> 00:12:25,765
and dashed off.

244
00:12:26,126 --> 00:12:28,486
Good, well done.

245
00:12:29,366 --> 00:12:30,366
Let's go.

246
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:51,966
How could

247
00:12:52,046 --> 00:12:53,805
we come across such a thing?

248
00:12:55,126 --> 00:12:56,526
How should we tell Youyou?

249
00:12:56,606 --> 00:12:57,846
Do you think Youyou's master

250
00:12:58,006 --> 00:12:59,246
will get better?

251
00:12:59,685 --> 00:13:01,165
I don't think so.

252
00:13:01,805 --> 00:13:03,286
When I took the medicine

253
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:03,966
from his pocket

254
00:13:04,046 --> 00:13:05,405
and stuffed it into his mouth,

255
00:13:05,726 --> 00:13:06,725
his body

256
00:13:06,805 --> 00:13:08,126
wasn't moving at all.

257
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:09,445
He was not breathing.

258
00:13:09,805 --> 00:13:11,286
And when the ambulance arrived,

259
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:13,165
the doctor felt his pulse

260
00:13:13,285 --> 00:13:14,285
and shook head.

261
00:13:15,445 --> 00:13:16,605
Maybe we shouldn't have gone

262
00:13:16,685 --> 00:13:17,685
so that we wouldn't

263
00:13:17,805 --> 00:13:19,405
see that and feel bad.

264
00:13:26,565 --> 00:13:27,565
What is this?

265
00:13:30,206 --> 00:13:31,365
(Dad, Mom,)

266
00:13:31,445 --> 00:13:32,247
(emergency at work.)

267
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:33,725
(I must go back to handle it.)

268
00:13:33,805 --> 00:13:35,606
(It's a serious matter.
So stop the fuss.)

269
00:13:37,246 --> 00:13:38,246
What should we do?

270
00:13:39,045 --> 00:13:40,045
What else can we do?

271
00:13:40,326 --> 00:13:41,486
Someone had an accident.

272
00:13:41,606 --> 00:13:43,085
And we called the ambulance.

273
00:13:43,165 --> 00:13:44,405
We can't drag Youyou back

274
00:13:44,486 --> 00:13:46,086
at such a time, right?

275
00:13:51,925 --> 00:13:52,925
Yiersan.

276
00:13:56,366 --> 00:13:57,606
Come here, Yiersan.

277
00:14:00,445 --> 00:14:01,445
Yiersan.

278
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:04,445
Come over.

279
00:14:05,765 --> 00:14:07,006
Don't you recognize me?

280
00:14:09,366 --> 00:14:10,366
Yiersan.

281
00:14:15,405 --> 00:14:16,405
Yiersan.

282
00:14:17,366 --> 00:14:18,086
Aren't you happy

283
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,246
seeing me back now?

284
00:14:22,606 --> 00:14:24,366
I know you miss the master.

285
00:14:28,045 --> 00:14:29,246
I have come back.

286
00:14:29,525 --> 00:14:31,085
He will definitely come back too.

287
00:14:31,165 --> 00:14:32,165
Right?

288
00:14:34,086 --> 00:14:35,086
Let's go.

289
00:14:36,165 --> 00:14:37,165
(Management Office)
Let's go.

290
00:15:08,222 --> 00:15:10,808
(Uncle)

291
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:18,846
Qian Hao.

292
00:15:19,045 --> 00:15:19,845
Uncle.

293
00:15:19,925 --> 00:15:21,406
At 1 PM three days later,

294
00:15:21,486 --> 00:15:22,646
when Xiaojiao is discharged,

295
00:15:22,726 --> 00:15:23,886
bring your household book,

296
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,325
ID card, and marriage certificate,

297
00:15:25,405 --> 00:15:26,685
go to the Civil Affairs Bureau,

298
00:15:26,765 --> 00:15:27,805
and get a divorce.

299
00:15:27,925 --> 00:15:28,925
Uncle,

300
00:15:29,645 --> 00:15:30,645
well,

301
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:32,605
now the biggest obstacle

302
00:15:32,685 --> 00:15:33,965
between Xiaojiao and me

303
00:15:34,045 --> 00:15:35,045
is already gone.

304
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:37,806
I don't want to divorce Xiaojiao.

305
00:15:37,886 --> 00:15:38,486
Qian Hao,

306
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:39,605
this is not a discussion.

307
00:15:39,685 --> 00:15:40,846
I'm informing you.

308
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:41,726
Don't think

309
00:15:41,806 --> 00:15:43,445
your 'nothing to lose' strategy

310
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,405
can intimidate me.

311
00:15:44,486 --> 00:15:45,605
I don't care.

312
00:15:45,685 --> 00:15:46,725
At most, I'll quit

313
00:15:46,805 --> 00:15:47,527
my job.

314
00:15:47,607 --> 00:15:48,805
But I guarantee

315
00:15:48,886 --> 00:15:51,366
there will be no room for you
in Jiang City.

316
00:15:51,645 --> 00:15:52,406
Of course,

317
00:15:52,486 --> 00:15:54,045
if you obediently

318
00:15:54,285 --> 00:15:55,886
divorce Xiaojiao,

319
00:15:56,006 --> 00:15:57,646
although I really don't like you,

320
00:15:57,726 --> 00:15:59,445
for Xiaojiao's sake,

321
00:15:59,606 --> 00:16:00,645
we can go

322
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:02,406
our separate ways in the future.

323
00:16:02,486 --> 00:16:03,685
You weigh it yourself.

324
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:04,726
Remember.

325
00:16:04,806 --> 00:16:06,126
1 PM three days later,

326
00:16:06,206 --> 00:16:07,765
at the Civil Affairs Bureau.

327
00:16:08,846 --> 00:16:09,846
U-Uncle.

328
00:16:44,645 --> 00:16:45,445
We're back.

329
00:16:45,525 --> 00:16:46,325
Mom, we're back.

330
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:47,126
You're back.

331
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:47,766
We're back.

332
00:16:47,846 --> 00:16:48,846
This soup is just ready.

333
00:17:01,565 --> 00:17:02,287
Mom,

334
00:17:02,367 --> 00:17:04,046
why can't I see next door anymore?

335
00:17:04,286 --> 00:17:04,967
To prevent

336
00:17:05,047 --> 00:17:06,125
World War II,

337
00:17:06,205 --> 00:17:06,925
starting today,

338
00:17:07,005 --> 00:17:08,766
you can't play with the kids next door.

339
00:17:10,126 --> 00:17:10,807
But isn't Mr. Mei

340
00:17:10,887 --> 00:17:12,245
your boyfriend?

341
00:17:12,766 --> 00:17:14,125
So what if he's my boyfriend?

342
00:17:14,205 --> 00:17:15,845
His kids have nothing to do with you.

343
00:17:15,925 --> 00:17:16,645
This home

344
00:17:16,725 --> 00:17:17,126
will

345
00:17:17,206 --> 00:17:18,566
always be your and Xiaomi's world.

346
00:17:19,126 --> 00:17:20,126
Mom.

347
00:17:20,526 --> 00:17:21,845
Eat quickly. Hurry.

348
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:22,566
Okay.

349
00:17:22,766 --> 00:17:24,405
Come on. Let's eat.

350
00:17:26,725 --> 00:17:27,406
Dad,

351
00:17:27,486 --> 00:17:28,605
why can't we

352
00:17:28,685 --> 00:17:30,165
play with the annoying kids?

353
00:17:30,245 --> 00:17:31,245
Yeah.

354
00:17:32,005 --> 00:17:33,766
Because they're annoying kids.

355
00:17:34,005 --> 00:17:35,086
Since you don't like them,

356
00:17:35,405 --> 00:17:36,925
you can stop playing with them.

357
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:37,766
I can't let you

358
00:17:37,846 --> 00:17:38,605
be wronged,

359
00:17:38,685 --> 00:17:39,125
right?

360
00:17:39,205 --> 00:17:40,126
But they are

361
00:17:40,206 --> 00:17:42,245
Ms. Kaixin's kids.

362
00:17:43,046 --> 00:17:44,245
As for Ms. Kaixin,

363
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,806
if you really don't like her,

364
00:17:48,165 --> 00:17:49,645
we can keep a distance for her too.

365
00:17:50,766 --> 00:17:51,766
But...

366
00:17:52,685 --> 00:17:53,886
Alright, let's eat.

367
00:18:04,046 --> 00:18:05,965
(Come to the balcony.
There's food of love.)

368
00:18:11,326 --> 00:18:12,326
Eat more.

369
00:18:19,046 --> 00:18:20,046
Take this.

370
00:18:30,766 --> 00:18:31,566
What's this?

371
00:18:31,766 --> 00:18:32,846
Open it.

372
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:39,685
Chives and kidney.

373
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,846
Just eat.

374
00:18:54,405 --> 00:18:55,846
Honey, hurry up.

375
00:18:56,086 --> 00:18:57,405
We can't be late today.

376
00:18:58,046 --> 00:18:59,286
We need to pick up Xiaojiao

377
00:18:59,526 --> 00:19:01,205
and go to the Civil Affairs Bureau.

378
00:19:02,645 --> 00:19:03,766
Will Qian Hao go?

379
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,405
Divorce isn't that simple.

380
00:19:07,366 --> 00:19:08,645
As long as we're not greedy,

381
00:19:08,806 --> 00:19:10,245
the divorce will happen.

382
00:19:11,366 --> 00:19:12,286
They don't have

383
00:19:12,366 --> 00:19:13,366
any shared property.

384
00:19:14,126 --> 00:19:15,806
That apartment belongs to Qian Hao.

385
00:19:16,165 --> 00:19:19,005
All Xiaojiao's assets are premarital.

386
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,685
These years, Xiaojiao spends

387
00:19:21,965 --> 00:19:24,086
almost all the money my sister gave her.

388
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:25,205
I guess

389
00:19:25,925 --> 00:19:27,086
there's not much left.

390
00:19:27,286 --> 00:19:29,605
As for Qian Hao's salary

391
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:30,806
and commission,

392
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:33,846
consider it's for
his mother's treatment.

393
00:19:35,046 --> 00:19:36,645
My sister doesn't care about that money.

394
00:19:39,046 --> 00:19:40,086
So she will be discharged

395
00:19:41,126 --> 00:19:42,286
and get divorced in a day.

396
00:19:43,846 --> 00:19:45,445
But there's a follow-up problem.

397
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:47,086
What problem?

398
00:19:48,725 --> 00:19:50,886
Where will
your sister and Xiaojiao live?

399
00:19:54,046 --> 00:19:55,046
Honey,

400
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,645
let them stay here

401
00:19:56,725 --> 00:19:57,725
for a few days.

402
00:19:57,965 --> 00:19:59,046
I promise,

403
00:19:59,405 --> 00:20:00,685
they won't stay long.

404
00:20:00,925 --> 00:20:03,165
My sister
will take Xiaojiao abroad soon.

405
00:20:04,046 --> 00:20:06,005
At that time, we can

406
00:20:06,485 --> 00:20:09,645
continue our happy life.

407
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:13,165
Then you should pray.

408
00:20:13,846 --> 00:20:14,645
Pray

409
00:20:14,766 --> 00:20:16,685
that their stay

410
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:18,806
won't wreck our marriage.

411
00:20:19,366 --> 00:20:21,245
It won't happen.

412
00:20:23,286 --> 00:20:24,405
Don't worry.

413
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,085
Sweetie,

414
00:20:41,165 --> 00:20:41,925
what are you doing?

415
00:20:42,005 --> 00:20:42,846
Don't do this move.

416
00:20:42,926 --> 00:20:44,286
Hurry, come down.

417
00:20:44,405 --> 00:20:45,085
You had surgery.

418
00:20:45,165 --> 00:20:45,926
Don't do this.

419
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:47,125
Are you silly? Are you okay?

420
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:47,406
Yeah.

421
00:20:47,486 --> 00:20:48,565
I've been in bed for days,

422
00:20:48,645 --> 00:20:50,165
so my whole body is stiff.

423
00:20:50,245 --> 00:20:50,767
The workout

424
00:20:50,847 --> 00:20:52,645
will make me more energetic.

425
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:53,885
I can't believe you.

426
00:20:53,965 --> 00:20:54,486
Don't move.

427
00:20:54,566 --> 00:20:55,326
Take it slow.

428
00:20:55,406 --> 00:20:57,005
Tidy up these things.

429
00:20:57,286 --> 00:20:58,325
Why does Tianya

430
00:20:58,405 --> 00:21:00,526
want me to wait for notice?

431
00:21:00,606 --> 00:21:02,046
What does he want?

432
00:21:04,485 --> 00:21:05,485
Mom,

433
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:07,806
are you still deceiving Tianya?

434
00:21:08,205 --> 00:21:10,005
It's not deceiving. It's communicating.

435
00:21:10,965 --> 00:21:12,806
Mom, stop it.

436
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,206
You spent 5,000 yuan.

437
00:21:14,286 --> 00:21:15,645
What if you can't get it back?

438
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:17,646
I know

439
00:21:17,726 --> 00:21:19,046
what I am doing.

440
00:21:20,485 --> 00:21:22,205
No one can deceive me.

441
00:21:25,606 --> 00:21:26,645
It's 10,000 yuan.

442
00:21:28,205 --> 00:21:29,205
What are you doing?

443
00:21:29,685 --> 00:21:30,806
I'm collecting it.

444
00:21:31,965 --> 00:21:33,846
I will collect it, and I must.

445
00:21:37,205 --> 00:21:38,205
That's great.

446
00:21:40,685 --> 00:21:42,205
Mom, you're committing a fraud.

447
00:21:43,126 --> 00:21:44,006
Mom,

448
00:21:44,086 --> 00:21:44,885
I beg you.

449
00:21:44,965 --> 00:21:45,606
My world

450
00:21:45,686 --> 00:21:47,046
is now a complete mess.

451
00:21:47,126 --> 00:21:47,686
I beg you.

452
00:21:47,766 --> 00:21:48,126
No more

453
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:49,246
trouble or problems.

454
00:21:49,326 --> 00:21:50,205
Hurry up.

455
00:21:50,326 --> 00:21:51,047
Return

456
00:21:51,127 --> 00:21:52,405
the 5,000 yuan to him.

457
00:21:52,485 --> 00:21:53,885
Returning the principal to us

458
00:21:53,965 --> 00:21:55,125
means he's a good person.

459
00:21:55,205 --> 00:21:55,727
Besides,

460
00:21:55,807 --> 00:21:57,205
Tianya is never a fraudster.

461
00:21:57,405 --> 00:21:58,325
You are so silly.

462
00:21:58,405 --> 00:21:59,047
I'll tell you.

463
00:21:59,127 --> 00:22:00,245
Look at this group.

464
00:22:00,725 --> 00:22:01,846
Actually, Tianya

465
00:22:02,046 --> 00:22:02,727
specially

466
00:22:02,807 --> 00:22:04,125
set up the group for you.

467
00:22:04,205 --> 00:22:05,925
All of them are scammers.

468
00:22:06,005 --> 00:22:07,806
I know pig-butchering scams

469
00:22:08,086 --> 00:22:09,205
have scammed a lot

470
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,206
of intellectuals,

471
00:22:10,286 --> 00:22:11,166
undergraduates,

472
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:12,845
doctoral students, and so on. I didn't

473
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:14,086
expect my own daughter

474
00:22:14,326 --> 00:22:16,005
would be deceived by a conman too.

475
00:22:16,205 --> 00:22:18,205
Now it's you who is deceiving him.

476
00:22:18,445 --> 00:22:19,047
Shut up.

477
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:20,445
How could I possibly deceive him?

478
00:22:20,685 --> 00:22:23,325
This is the return on my investment.

479
00:22:23,405 --> 00:22:25,085
He gave it to me.
Of course, I'd take it.

480
00:22:25,165 --> 00:22:26,445
I simply told him

481
00:22:26,606 --> 00:22:27,605
my family was rich

482
00:22:27,685 --> 00:22:29,445
and that if his profit was high,

483
00:22:29,846 --> 00:22:30,566
we would invest

484
00:22:30,646 --> 00:22:31,925
a million or so,

485
00:22:32,005 --> 00:22:34,085
making him think there was a chance

486
00:22:34,165 --> 00:22:35,645
I might invest more.

487
00:22:35,806 --> 00:22:36,806
That's why

488
00:22:36,886 --> 00:22:39,606
he gave me such a high profit.

489
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:40,726
Of course, I'd take it.

490
00:22:40,806 --> 00:22:41,845
5,000 yuan is still money.

491
00:22:41,925 --> 00:22:42,406
You took it?

492
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,365
Every little bit helps.

493
00:22:44,445 --> 00:22:46,405
This is how our family got rich.

494
00:22:47,886 --> 00:22:48,606
I took it.

495
00:22:48,686 --> 00:22:50,005
And I'll also delete him.

496
00:22:50,366 --> 00:22:51,366
Mom.

497
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:54,526
You deleted him?

498
00:22:54,606 --> 00:22:56,286
I will, and I must.

499
00:22:58,526 --> 00:22:59,526
Why are you so foolish?

500
00:22:59,606 --> 00:23:01,046
How could you just delete him?

501
00:23:01,245 --> 00:23:01,925
Listen to me.

502
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:02,925
If you contact him,

503
00:23:03,005 --> 00:23:03,687
I'll do it again.

504
00:23:03,767 --> 00:23:05,046
Don't associate with him.

505
00:23:05,126 --> 00:23:06,125
Do you understand?

506
00:23:06,205 --> 00:23:07,205
Give me the phone.

507
00:23:07,526 --> 00:23:09,046
You've deleted him. Give it to me.

508
00:23:09,405 --> 00:23:10,365
Alright, here you are.

509
00:23:10,445 --> 00:23:11,247
Don't be angry.

510
00:23:11,327 --> 00:23:12,886
It's not good for your health.

511
00:23:14,405 --> 00:23:15,126
I know

512
00:23:15,206 --> 00:23:16,885
you are kind and pure.

513
00:23:16,965 --> 00:23:18,086
But these people

514
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:20,645
want to play tricks on us.

515
00:23:20,725 --> 00:23:21,725
No way.

516
00:23:22,366 --> 00:23:23,526
That woman

517
00:23:23,606 --> 00:23:25,405
is really rich.

518
00:23:25,485 --> 00:23:26,605
It's just that she's silly.

519
00:23:26,685 --> 00:23:27,526
Scamming her

520
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:28,446
even seems unfair.

521
00:23:28,526 --> 00:23:29,126
Well, let's

522
00:23:29,206 --> 00:23:30,486
scam her out of 100,000 or so

523
00:23:30,566 --> 00:23:31,606
and settle the deal.

524
00:23:32,725 --> 00:23:34,005
Are you brainless?

525
00:23:34,766 --> 00:23:35,686
A rich prey in sight,

526
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:36,766
what's with the softness?

527
00:23:39,046 --> 00:23:40,286
The softer a man is,

528
00:23:40,405 --> 00:23:41,685
the less he can achieve big.

529
00:23:41,766 --> 00:23:42,645
Use the voice changer

530
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:43,485
on her.

531
00:23:43,685 --> 00:23:45,006
Scam her for another 50,000 today

532
00:23:45,086 --> 00:23:46,885
and pay her back only the interest.

533
00:23:46,965 --> 00:23:47,527
In that way,

534
00:23:47,607 --> 00:23:48,806
we'll make a foolproof profit.

535
00:23:50,286 --> 00:23:51,286
Easy-peasy.

536
00:23:51,485 --> 00:23:52,485
Just watch.

537
00:23:57,766 --> 00:23:58,766
Look what this is.

538
00:24:00,286 --> 00:24:02,885
The technology now is really impressive.

539
00:24:02,965 --> 00:24:04,086
With such a small device,

540
00:24:04,445 --> 00:24:05,126
when you speak,

541
00:24:05,206 --> 00:24:06,645
the voice isn't yours anymore.

542
00:24:06,886 --> 00:24:08,046
You can choose the gender,

543
00:24:08,126 --> 00:24:09,806
and the voice sounds good too.

544
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:16,086
Look.

545
00:24:20,165 --> 00:24:21,165
Xiaojiao,

546
00:24:22,326 --> 00:24:23,445
you have seen the profit

547
00:24:23,566 --> 00:24:24,485
of this project.

548
00:24:24,566 --> 00:24:26,485
The opportunity is quite rare.

549
00:24:26,925 --> 00:24:28,205
If you are interested,

550
00:24:28,566 --> 00:24:31,005
I can talk to the partner

551
00:24:31,165 --> 00:24:32,165
and leave you some quota

552
00:24:32,526 --> 00:24:34,005
for additional investment.

553
00:24:34,086 --> 00:24:35,206
So you don't have to earn

554
00:24:35,286 --> 00:24:36,485
those small amounts behind me.

555
00:24:39,224 --> 00:24:39,960
(Verification Needed)

556
00:24:43,606 --> 00:24:45,606
You are not her friend yet.

557
00:24:45,806 --> 00:24:48,405
Please send
a friend verification request first?

558
00:24:49,846 --> 00:24:50,767
I can't believe her.

559
00:24:50,847 --> 00:24:51,886
How dare she?

560
00:24:52,005 --> 00:24:52,727
She's scamming

561
00:24:52,807 --> 00:24:54,286
a scam syndicate?

562
00:24:55,126 --> 00:24:56,126
Brothers,

563
00:24:56,566 --> 00:24:57,566
assemble.

564
00:25:00,046 --> 00:25:01,845
Our battle horn

565
00:25:01,925 --> 00:25:03,125
has already sounded.

566
00:25:03,205 --> 00:25:04,886
I won't accept this.

567
00:25:05,445 --> 00:25:06,366
If we can't

568
00:25:06,446 --> 00:25:07,966
secure 300,000 from this deal,

569
00:25:08,046 --> 00:25:09,165
I'll jump off a building

570
00:25:09,245 --> 00:25:10,245
here in this city.

571
00:25:11,046 --> 00:25:11,845
Did you hear me?

572
00:25:11,925 --> 00:25:13,685
Let's get to work.

573
00:25:14,606 --> 00:25:16,086
It's five minutes past 1 PM.

574
00:25:16,445 --> 00:25:18,046
Did Qian Hao change his mind?

575
00:25:18,405 --> 00:25:19,405
He wouldn't dare.

576
00:25:20,165 --> 00:25:21,286
If he doesn't come,

(Civil Affairs Bureau)
I'll have someone tie him up

578
00:25:22,846 --> 00:25:24,286
and bring him here.

579
00:25:24,925 --> 00:25:26,046
I'll give him a call.

580
00:25:26,606 --> 00:25:28,005
Uncle, it won't make a difference.

581
00:25:28,645 --> 00:25:30,086
We're about to get divorced.

582
00:25:30,286 --> 00:25:31,445
I want to look decent.

583
00:25:32,766 --> 00:25:34,606
Let's listen to her on this matter.

584
00:25:51,326 --> 00:25:52,326
Thank you.

585
00:25:53,245 --> 00:25:54,245
Let's go inside.

586
00:26:09,205 --> 00:26:11,126
They're making the divorce so romantic.

587
00:26:12,205 --> 00:26:13,205
Did you see that?

588
00:26:13,526 --> 00:26:15,086
Having gone through this,

589
00:26:15,286 --> 00:26:16,405
Xiaojiao seems to have

590
00:26:16,485 --> 00:26:17,685
grown up suddenly.

592
00:26:27,405 --> 00:26:28,486
(I've booked a day for you)

593
00:26:28,566 --> 00:26:29,885
(after the 30-day cooling-off.)

594
00:26:29,965 --> 00:26:31,445
(Come to get the certificates then.)

595
00:26:44,245 --> 00:26:45,245
Xiaojiao,

596
00:26:46,046 --> 00:26:47,046
my mom's illness

597
00:26:47,965 --> 00:26:49,286
still needs money.

598
00:26:50,606 --> 00:26:52,005
After we get through this,

599
00:26:52,685 --> 00:26:53,885
I'll definitely transfer you

600
00:26:53,965 --> 00:26:54,965
more money.

601
00:26:55,685 --> 00:26:56,685
Qian Hao,

602
00:26:57,326 --> 00:26:58,806
if it were money I wanted,

603
00:26:59,126 --> 00:27:00,645
I wouldn't have gone through so much

604
00:27:00,725 --> 00:27:01,806
to be with you at first.

605
00:27:09,245 --> 00:27:10,245
I'm sorry.

606
00:27:16,445 --> 00:27:17,725
I have one more request.

607
00:27:18,925 --> 00:27:19,925
Go ahead.

608
00:27:22,445 --> 00:27:23,685

610
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:33,685

Hurry up.

633
00:30:16,526 --> 00:30:19,005
Wake up. Hurry.

634
00:30:19,725 --> 00:30:20,966
Let me sleep a little longer.

635
00:30:21,046 --> 00:30:22,046
Wake up.

636
00:30:22,526 --> 00:30:23,526
Hurry up.

637
00:30:23,766 --> 00:30:24,487
Or you'll be late.

638
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:25,766
Hurry up.

639
00:30:28,566 --> 00:30:29,566
Yu'an, Yule,

640
00:30:30,086 --> 00:30:31,086
hurry up.

641
00:30:36,205 --> 00:30:37,446
Hurry up.

642
00:30:37,526 --> 00:30:38,566
Are you done? Let's go.

643
00:30:39,245 --> 00:30:40,245

00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:42,526
hurry up and pack it up.

646
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:43,606
Okay.

647
00:30:51,126 --> 00:30:52,126
Come on, Yu'an.

648
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:53,766
Let me tie your hair.

649
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:55,086
Have you chosen?

650
00:30:56,205 --> 00:30:57,445
Quick, choose one.

651
00:30:58,086 --> 00:30:58,766
I want this one.

652
00:30:58,846 --> 00:30:59,846
Alright.

653
00:31:17,846 --> 00:31:18,886
So abundant?

654
00:31:22,086 --> 00:31:23,286
Your new store opens today.

655
00:31:23,366 --> 00:31:24,645
I got a flower basket for you.

656
00:31:24,806 --> 00:31:25,606
Keep it up.

657
00:31:25,725 --> 00:31:26,806
Let the moms in your group

658
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:27,886

(and her small family)

662
00:31:35,485 --> 00:31:37,086
(live right next door to me.)

663
00:31:37,846 --> 00:31:39,846
(In the contracted life,
nothing seems changed,)

664
00:31:40,086 --> 00:31:41,205
(yet everything's changed.)

665
00:31:41,592 --> 00:31:43,405
- (Occasional sharing of love,)
- Which one?

666
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:44,565
(occasional secret joy,)

667
00:31:44,645 --> 00:31:45,966
(assistance when needed,)

668
00:31:46,046 --> 00:31:48,005
(and overflowing
emotional value output.)

669
00:31:48,245 --> 00:31:50,286
(Both families maintain independence)

670
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,286
(and respect each other's past lives)

671
00:31:52,485 --> 00:31:54,165
(while they reach out for each other.)

672
00:31:54,526 --> 00:31:55,846
(Everything is harmonious.)

673
00:31:56,326 --> 00:31:57,326
(Except)

674
00:31:57,606 --> 00:31:59,205
(the four kids who are not very so.)

675
00:32:00,925 --> 00:32:01,845
We came out first.

676
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:02,925
We should go first.

677
00:32:03,126 --> 00:32:04,126
Xiaomi, go.

678
00:32:04,245 --> 00:32:05,246
Woof, woof.

679
00:32:05,326 --> 00:32:06,326
We should go first.

680
00:32:06,526 --> 00:32:07,766
Not just you can woof.

681
00:32:07,846 --> 00:32:08,727
We can too.

682
00:32:08,807 --> 00:32:10,286
Woof, woof, woof, woof.

683
00:32:10,366 --> 00:32:11,366
Xiaomi, let's go.

684
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:13,405
We came out first.

685
00:32:13,526 --> 00:32:14,046
Enough.

686
00:32:14,126 --> 00:32:15,126
Compromise a little.

687
00:32:16,286 --> 00:32:17,006
Lili,

688
00:32:17,086 --> 00:32:17,526
let them

689
00:32:17,606 --> 00:32:18,405
solve it themselves.

690
00:32:18,485 --> 00:32:19,806
Yes, let them solve it.

691
00:32:19,886 --> 00:32:21,086
We came out first.

692
00:32:21,366 --> 00:32:22,006
So we go first.

693
00:32:22,086 --> 00:32:22,726
Xiaomi is good.

694
00:32:22,806 --> 00:32:23,365
He will bite

695
00:32:23,445 --> 00:32:24,166
my bully.

696
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:25,885
My sister is good too.

697
00:32:25,965 --> 00:32:26,806
He dares to eat dirt.

698
00:32:26,886 --> 00:32:27,446
Does she?

699
00:32:27,526 --> 00:32:28,125
Dami, I...

700
00:32:28,205 --> 00:32:28,925
Shut up.

701
00:32:29,046 --> 00:32:29,527
Eat dirt?

702
00:32:29,607 --> 00:32:31,046
My sister is also awesome.

703
00:32:31,126 --> 00:32:32,205
Show them.

704
00:32:32,846 --> 00:32:34,086
I don't want to.

705
00:32:34,286 --> 00:32:35,007
Then...

706
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:36,806
My dad is awesome too.

707
00:32:36,925 --> 00:32:38,565
Dad, woof.

708
00:32:38,645 --> 00:32:39,366
Mom, go.

709
00:32:39,446 --> 00:32:40,526
Mom, go.

710
00:32:40,606 --> 00:32:41,606
Talk to them.

711
00:32:41,606 --> 00:32:42,566
- Shut up!
- Alright.

712
00:32:42,685 --> 00:32:43,566
Let's go.

713
00:32:43,646 --> 00:32:45,206
There's no time. Hurry.

714
00:32:45,286 --> 00:32:46,286
Come on.

715
00:32:47,086 --> 00:32:48,205
My dad has a car.

716
00:32:48,645 --> 00:32:49,886
My mom also has a car.

717
00:32:50,925 --> 00:32:51,925
Okay, that's enough.

718
00:32:52,046 --> 00:32:53,046
My mom is a tigress.

719
00:32:53,126 --> 00:32:54,126
Yes.

720
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:56,925
Get in the car. Quickly.

721
00:32:57,005 --> 00:32:58,005
Get in the car.

722
00:32:58,086 --> 00:32:59,085
Get in the car.

723
00:32:59,165 --> 00:33:00,246
My father has a car.

724
00:33:00,326 --> 00:33:02,445
- There's no time. Hurry.
- Dad has a car.

725
00:33:02,445 --> 00:33:03,325
My dad has a car.

726
00:33:03,405 --> 00:33:04,405
Kaixin.

727
00:33:04,725 --> 00:33:05,606
My mom also has a car.

728
00:33:05,686 --> 00:33:06,645
Her cooking is the best.

729
00:33:06,725 --> 00:33:08,245
Here. I've prepared you some fruits

730
00:33:08,566 --> 00:33:09,566
to boost your vitamins.

731
00:33:09,766 --> 00:33:10,366
Thank you.

732
00:33:10,606 --> 00:33:11,685
My mom also has a car.

733
00:33:13,046 --> 00:33:14,046
Okay, stop arguing.

734
00:33:29,405 --> 00:33:30,806
Xiaomi, you did great today.

735
00:33:30,886 --> 00:33:31,487
Do you know?

736
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:33,405
Your duty is to protect me.

737
00:33:33,485 --> 00:33:34,007
How about

738
00:33:34,087 --> 00:33:35,766
I crown you as my little knight?

739
00:33:37,405 --> 00:33:38,925
Yes, Your Highness the Princess.

(Indeed,)

745
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:55,126
(life is a battle every day.)

746
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,605
(During my worst days,)

747
00:33:56,685 --> 00:33:58,286
(I read a passage like this:)

748
00:33:58,566 --> 00:33:59,287
(In one's life,)

749
00:33:59,367 --> 00:34:00,925
(if you can avoid natural disasters,)

750
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:02,126
(wars,)

751
00:34:02,405 --> 00:34:04,125
(bad people, and major illnesses,)

752
00:34:04,205 --> 00:34:05,965
(it's already great fortune in life.)

753
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:07,806
(If you also have a happy family)

754
00:34:07,886 --> 00:34:08,965
(and stable income,)

755
00:34:09,045 --> 00:34:10,925
(it's a tremendous blessing
from heaven.)

756
00:34:11,886 --> 00:34:13,325
(Amid life's uncertainties,)

757
00:34:13,405 --> 00:34:14,766
(the family being safe and sound)

758
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:16,485
(is already the best of fortunes.)

759
00:34:16,925 --> 00:34:18,206
(I wonder which wise person's)

760
00:34:18,286 --> 00:34:19,326
(life summary this is.)

761
00:34:19,485 --> 00:34:21,606
(But it has become my motto
when I am weary.)

762
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:22,207
(So)

763
00:34:22,287 --> 00:34:23,965
(I am grateful for my current life.)

764
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:25,806
(But I think)

765
00:34:25,886 --> 00:34:27,525

Bye.

775
00:34:49,445 --> 00:34:49,925
Let's go.

776
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:51,005
Okay.

777
00:34:55,005 --> 00:34:56,005
Lili.

778
00:34:57,166 --> 00:34:58,166
I'm sorry.

779
00:34:58,605 --> 00:34:59,925
I lost my mind earlier.

780
00:35:00,286 --> 00:35:01,127
Now I've calmed down.

781
00:35:01,207 --> 00:35:02,485
Can we have a talk?

782
00:35:04,485 --> 00:35:05,485
Sure.

783
00:35:05,605 --> 00:35:06,605
Ten minutes.

784
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:08,686
Are you so busy now?

785
00:35:09,806 --> 00:35:11,246
A minute has passed now.

786
00:35:12,925 --> 00:35:13,965
Okay, I'll wait for you.

787
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:18,485
I'll go with you.

788
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:19,886
No need.

789
00:35:20,565 --> 00:35:22,286
This talk will happen sooner or later.

790
00:35:22,565 --> 00:35:23,565
You may not know.

791
00:35:23,806 --> 00:35:24,885
Recently, Qian Hao has been

792
00:35:24,965 --> 00:35:26,846
following Dami daily
after she leaves school.

793
00:35:27,366 --> 00:35:28,247
To not expose

794
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:29,646
the location of our new home,

795
00:35:29,726 --> 00:35:31,485
Dami has to detour before going home.

796
00:35:31,846 --> 00:35:33,045
It won't do like this.

797
00:35:33,125 --> 00:35:34,565
The sooner it's handled, the better.

798
00:35:38,782 --> 00:35:40,888
(The Taste of Alleyways)

799
00:35:41,086 --> 00:35:43,416
(A Must-eat)

800
00:35:45,445 --> 00:35:46,445
I'm sorry.

801
00:35:46,605 --> 00:35:48,485
It's too early.
No coffee shops are open.

802
00:35:49,005 --> 00:35:50,005
This is the only place.

803
00:35:50,206 --> 00:35:51,206
It's pretty good.

804
00:35:51,326 --> 00:35:53,045
Soy milk is healthier than coffee.

805
00:35:53,246 --> 00:35:54,846
But I've already had breakfast.

806
00:35:56,206 --> 00:35:57,206
I forgot.

807
00:35:57,326 --> 00:35:58,166
You are a woman

808
00:35:58,286 --> 00:35:59,566
who can take great care

809
00:35:59,646 --> 00:36:01,166
of yourself and those around you.

810
00:36:01,965 --> 00:36:03,766
All thanks to you.

811
00:36:06,326 --> 00:36:07,566
Though you've eaten,

812
00:36:07,646 --> 00:36:09,166
I remember you love to eat

813
00:36:09,246 --> 00:36:10,365
crab roe soup dumplings.

814
00:36:10,445 --> 00:36:11,525
I ordered this for you.

815
00:36:12,286 --> 00:36:13,085
Thank you.

816
00:36:13,206 --> 00:36:14,485
Then I'll eat it.

817
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,565
You look pretty emotionally stable.

818
00:36:24,846 --> 00:36:26,286
Has Ms. Qin gotten better?

819
00:36:26,846 --> 00:36:29,286
Life is always changing.

820
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:30,886
Before, you called her Mom.

821
00:36:31,726 --> 00:36:33,485
Now, you only call her Ms. Qin.

822
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:35,125
I'll call her 'your mom'.

823
00:36:36,166 --> 00:36:37,366
At least there's a 'mom'.

824
00:36:37,605 --> 00:36:38,605
It seems harmonious.

825
00:36:40,206 --> 00:36:41,286
Well, Xu Kaixin,

826
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:42,886
why are you

827
00:36:42,966 --> 00:36:44,846
getting better and better at being mean?

828
00:36:45,686 --> 00:36:47,166
You used to be so gentle

829
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,166
and virtuous.

830
00:36:48,246 --> 00:36:49,046
You'd handle it all

831
00:36:49,126 --> 00:36:50,086
when my mom got sick.

832
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,566
And I never worried.

833
00:36:51,646 --> 00:36:52,046
We are

834
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,166
just divorced.

835
00:36:53,246 --> 00:36:54,686
Do you have to be so mean

836
00:36:54,766 --> 00:36:56,045
in your words and actions?

837
00:36:56,326 --> 00:36:57,045
Qian Hao,

838
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:57,886
I realize you are

839
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,686
indeed a sophisticated egoist.

840
00:36:59,846 --> 00:37:00,925
Listen to me. First,

841
00:37:01,005 --> 00:37:02,646
you lost Xiaomi,

842
00:37:02,726 --> 00:37:03,965
so I added conditions

843
00:37:04,045 --> 00:37:05,565
to ensure the kids' safety.

844
00:37:07,246 --> 00:37:08,246
Also,

845
00:37:08,366 --> 00:37:09,686
your mom's life values.

846
00:37:09,766 --> 00:37:10,486
But my life

847
00:37:10,566 --> 00:37:11,686
and the kids' value too.

848
00:37:13,445 --> 00:37:14,167
Do you remember

849
00:37:14,247 --> 00:37:15,846
what you complained to your mom about?

850
00:37:17,085 --> 00:37:17,885
You said

851
00:37:17,965 --> 00:37:19,485
remembering that scene

852
00:37:19,565 --> 00:37:20,565
during my labor

853
00:37:20,686 --> 00:37:22,565
made you feel sick.

854
00:37:24,166 --> 00:37:25,686
Your mom was even more amusing.

855
00:37:25,846 --> 00:37:27,086
When she saw Dami was a girl,

856
00:37:27,166 --> 00:37:28,246
she turned and left.

857
00:37:28,366 --> 00:37:29,965
She played sick
and never showed her face

858
00:37:30,045 --> 00:37:31,366
during my confinement month.

859
00:37:32,045 --> 00:37:33,286
At least I was honest.

860
00:37:33,366 --> 00:37:34,445
I wasn't hypocritical.

861
00:37:34,965 --> 00:37:36,566
I insisted on applying medicine for you.

862
00:37:36,646 --> 00:37:37,045
Right?

863
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:37,846
My mom's health

864
00:37:37,926 --> 00:37:39,045
has always been poor.

865
00:37:39,125 --> 00:37:39,686
So why

866
00:37:39,766 --> 00:37:40,525
criticize her?

867
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:41,287
I don't want

868
00:37:41,367 --> 00:37:42,525
to argue with you anymore.

869
00:37:43,166 --> 00:37:44,246
The first three years

870
00:37:44,326 --> 00:37:45,445
are the toughest.

871
00:37:45,565 --> 00:37:46,366
How much effort did

872
00:37:46,446 --> 00:37:47,485
your family contribute?

873
00:37:48,206 --> 00:37:50,005
Now you want Xiaomi's custody,

874
00:37:50,085 --> 00:37:52,525
telling me it's about
continuing your family line?

875
00:37:53,326 --> 00:37:54,326
Qian Hao,

876
00:37:54,646 --> 00:37:56,485
I never thought of having a second kid.

877
00:37:56,646 --> 00:37:57,567
You know best

878
00:37:57,647 --> 00:37:58,925
how I got pregnant.

879
00:37:59,166 --> 00:38:00,886
If it hadn't been for your dirty tricks,

880
00:38:01,206 --> 00:38:02,286
there wouldn't be Xiaomi.

881
00:38:02,726 --> 00:38:04,405
Do you dare say you love the kids?

882
00:38:05,005 --> 00:38:06,365
Motherly love is a woman's nature.

883
00:38:06,445 --> 00:38:07,525
Although I am not a woman,

884
00:38:07,605 --> 00:38:08,925
I know women,

885
00:38:09,005 --> 00:38:10,086
and I know motherly love.

886
00:38:10,166 --> 00:38:12,005
So mothers deserve it, right?

887
00:38:12,965 --> 00:38:14,405
Childbirth causes

888
00:38:14,485 --> 00:38:15,925
irreversible harm to women.

889
00:38:16,166 --> 00:38:17,087
After giving birth,

890
00:38:17,167 --> 00:38:18,845
women face life's pressures

891
00:38:18,925 --> 00:38:20,045
and constraints.

892
00:38:20,206 --> 00:38:21,686
Many new mothers experience

893
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:22,726
depressive emotions.

894
00:38:22,806 --> 00:38:23,607
They even feel

895
00:38:23,687 --> 00:38:25,365
repulsion towards the kids.

896
00:38:25,445 --> 00:38:26,566
But every mother

897
00:38:26,646 --> 00:38:27,806
knows

898
00:38:27,925 --> 00:38:29,086
a kid coming into this world

899
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:30,646
is not their choice alone.

900
00:38:30,846 --> 00:38:31,845
Choosing to have a kid

901
00:38:31,925 --> 00:38:33,206
means you must be responsible.

902
00:38:33,925 --> 00:38:35,445
Is having and raising kids hard?

903
00:38:35,846 --> 00:38:36,846
I'm telling you.

904
00:38:36,965 --> 00:38:37,965
It is hard.

905
00:38:38,166 --> 00:38:39,606
But the hardest part in all of this

906
00:38:39,686 --> 00:38:41,485
is thanks to you and your mom.

907
00:38:42,565 --> 00:38:43,406
All mothers

908
00:38:43,486 --> 00:38:44,766
have gone through this.

909
00:38:44,846 --> 00:38:46,126
When my mom gave birth to me,

910
00:38:46,206 --> 00:38:47,046
my dad wasn't home,

911
00:38:47,126 --> 00:38:48,845
and she raised me alone.

912
00:38:48,925 --> 00:38:49,885
Now that my mom is sick,

913
00:38:49,965 --> 00:38:50,525
my dad

914
00:38:50,605 --> 00:38:51,445
put everything aside

915
00:38:51,525 --> 00:38:52,406
to accompany my mom.

916
00:38:52,486 --> 00:38:54,286
After all, we're a family.

917
00:38:54,366 --> 00:38:55,046
Then you can

918
00:38:55,126 --> 00:38:56,126
stay being a family.

919
00:38:56,206 --> 00:38:57,566
Let your dad take care of her.

920
00:38:57,646 --> 00:38:58,925
I respect that.

921
00:39:00,166 --> 00:39:01,126
But please don't

922
00:39:01,206 --> 00:39:02,326
bother my life.

923
00:39:02,646 --> 00:39:03,406
Besides the kids,

924
00:39:03,486 --> 00:39:05,045
there is nothing between us now.

925
00:39:05,125 --> 00:39:06,246
We are now strangers.

926
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:14,646
Mei, you're back.

927
00:39:16,565 --> 00:39:17,565
Mei.

928
00:39:17,965 --> 00:39:18,965
Mei,

929
00:39:19,206 --> 00:39:20,206
you're back.

930
00:39:22,766 --> 00:39:24,365
Mei, you're finally back.

931
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:25,606
With you on a leave,

932
00:39:25,686 --> 00:39:26,325
we are

933
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,326
totally at a loss.

934
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,726
We're like headless chickens.

935
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:30,525
What happened exactly?

936
00:39:31,366 --> 00:39:33,445
I planned to celebrate my birthday.

937
00:39:33,726 --> 00:39:35,126
So I took annual leave.

938
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,845
Well, I'll treat you to lunch at noon.

939
00:39:36,925 --> 00:39:38,246
I'll make it up, okay?

940
00:39:38,326 --> 00:39:40,005
Okay, that's great.

941
00:39:56,565 --> 00:39:58,166
(Ms. Li, about that matter,)

942
00:39:58,246 --> 00:39:59,925
(I have already talked to the client)

943
00:40:00,405 --> 00:40:01,565
(and arranged the place.)

944
00:40:01,686 --> 00:40:02,686
(Don't worry about it.)

945
00:40:09,886 --> 00:40:11,405
Why did that nasty woman

946
00:40:12,565 --> 00:40:13,646
take my money

947
00:40:13,726 --> 00:40:15,326
and then delete me?

948
00:40:16,806 --> 00:40:18,485
If she were that smart,

949
00:40:18,686 --> 00:40:19,686
then who was exactly

950
00:40:20,085 --> 00:40:20,925
the prey

951
00:40:21,045 --> 00:40:22,286
between us and her at first?

952
00:40:23,246 --> 00:40:24,246
These city people

953
00:40:25,766 --> 00:40:26,965
are too evil.

954
00:40:28,085 --> 00:40:29,085
Yeah.

955
00:40:30,405 --> 00:40:32,085
She swindled us out of 5,000 yuan.

956
00:40:32,525 --> 00:40:33,566
If we can't get it back,

957
00:40:33,646 --> 00:40:34,726
it'll be on us.

958
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,326
It's so unlucky.

959
00:40:36,965 --> 00:40:39,005
Look at you, a bunch of losers.

960
00:40:39,286 --> 00:40:40,246
In this world,

961
00:40:40,326 --> 00:40:42,525
the hardest thing is persistence.

962
00:40:42,846 --> 00:40:44,206
How can we persist?

963
00:40:44,286 --> 00:40:45,087
She has deleted us.

964
00:40:45,167 --> 00:40:46,525
We can't even add her back.

965
00:40:47,405 --> 00:40:49,166
You still have to rely on me.

966
00:41:05,485 --> 00:41:06,485
(Profile)
This is for you.

967
00:41:10,286 --> 00:41:11,726
I have prepared two plans.

968
00:41:12,646 --> 00:41:13,405
Since the first

969
00:41:13,485 --> 00:41:14,087
didn't work,

970
00:41:14,167 --> 00:41:15,605
it can only be the second one.

971
00:41:16,686 --> 00:41:17,686
(Financial Arrangement)
I promise

972
00:41:18,286 --> 00:41:20,125
if I take Xiaomi away
without permission again,

973
00:41:20,246 --> 00:41:21,606
our divorce agreement will be void

974
00:41:21,686 --> 00:41:22,886
and half the house is yours.

975
00:41:23,085 --> 00:41:24,085
Really?

976
00:41:25,886 --> 00:41:27,326
(Contract)
I have no choice, okay?

977
00:41:27,806 --> 00:41:29,525
My mom is in bad health,

978
00:41:29,806 --> 00:41:30,607
and Hu Xiaojiao

979
00:41:30,687 --> 00:41:31,806
is about to divorce me.

980
00:41:32,405 --> 00:41:33,087
Without them,

981
00:41:33,167 --> 00:41:34,525
why do I need the apartment?

982
00:41:35,206 --> 00:41:36,206
I only ask you to let

983
00:41:37,045 --> 00:41:38,445
Xiaomi spend more time with my mom.

984
00:41:38,525 --> 00:41:39,286
Is that okay?

985
00:41:39,445 --> 00:41:40,686
Had you shown me this earlier,

986
00:41:40,766 --> 00:41:41,647
our conversation today

987
00:41:41,727 --> 00:41:43,326
would have been very pleasant.

988
00:41:44,366 --> 00:41:45,565
The breakfast is on me.

989
00:41:45,886 --> 00:41:47,286
Do you want to eat something more?

990
00:41:47,366 --> 00:41:48,565
No, I'm full.

991
00:41:48,886 --> 00:41:50,405
Then let's go to the notary office.

992
00:41:52,045 --> 00:41:53,166
Why are you in such a hurry?

993
00:41:53,246 --> 00:41:55,166
Aren't you opening soon?

994
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,605
The auspicious time is decided.

995
00:41:57,686 --> 00:41:59,565
That's right. But that can wait.

996
00:41:59,766 --> 00:42:00,485
When we married,

997
00:42:00,565 --> 00:42:01,565
we had that too.

998
00:42:01,965 --> 00:42:02,965
But it was useless.

999
00:42:05,246 --> 00:42:06,326
You...

1000
00:42:06,686 --> 00:42:07,566
Xu Kaixin,

1001
00:42:07,646 --> 00:42:08,326
why have you

1002
00:42:08,406 --> 00:42:09,686
become so realistic?

1003
00:42:09,766 --> 00:42:11,646
I don't want to hold you up
from discussing

1004
00:42:11,726 --> 00:42:12,965
the divorce with Hu Xiaojiao.

1005
00:42:13,045 --> 00:42:14,045
Hurry up.

1006
00:42:27,605 --> 00:42:29,206
(I have some dirt on your wife.)

1007
00:42:29,366 --> 00:42:30,366
(Want to see it?)

(Tianya Miserable Fellow)

1011
00:42:51,286 --> 00:42:51,807
What's wrong?

1012
00:42:51,887 --> 00:42:53,125
Do you regret it so quickly?

1013
00:42:53,886 --> 00:42:55,326
No, I don't.

1014
00:42:58,045 --> 00:42:59,045
How is it?

1015
00:43:00,326 --> 00:43:01,366
We'll visit the notary.

1016
00:43:01,886 --> 00:43:03,326
Why visit the notary?

1017
00:43:03,565 --> 00:43:04,646
