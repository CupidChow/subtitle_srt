No way.

18
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,480
It is too fast.

19
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,600
You need to slow down.

20
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,368
What?

21
00:01:49,368 --> 00:01:50,840
We're old.

22
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,056
Do you think we're still

young?

Not fast at all.

25
00:01:56,536 --> 00:01:57,752
Girl.

26
00:01:57,752 --> 00:01:59,640
Look in the mirror.

27
00:02:01,531 --> 00:02:02,872
Do I look

28
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,024
younger now?

29
00:02:07,371 --> 00:02:08,651
- He's here.
- Yeah.

30
00:02:08,651 --> 00:02:09,651
You go.

31
00:02:10,771 --> 00:02:12,810
Aunt, please don't mention it.

32
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,170
Don't tell Qian Hao.

33
00:02:14,371 --> 00:02:15,371
Xiaojiao,

34
00:02:16,091 --> 00:02:16,731
we don't

35
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:17,811
know anything.

36
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:19,251
We won't

37
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:21,010
interfere or get involved.

38
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,370
How about this?

39
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,172
Pack your things

40
00:02:23,252 --> 00:02:24,490
and go home with him.

41
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:25,172
No, Uncle...

42
00:02:25,252 --> 00:02:27,010
He may have made mistakes.

43
00:02:27,211 --> 00:02:28,490
But I can't scold him

44
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,251
after what you did.

45
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:31,610
You're on your own.

46
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:34,051
Uncle, Aunt.

47
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:47,251
The door is open.

48
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,290
Naughty girl.

49
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,691
You just decided

50
00:02:53,771 --> 00:02:54,810
to come and hide here.

51
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,450
What would they think of me?

52
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:57,811
What did I do?

53
00:02:57,891 --> 00:02:59,330
I just had a drink with Song Ran.

54
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,450
I didn't lie.

55
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,131
It won't happen again.

56
00:03:02,211 --> 00:03:02,972
Where is Uncle?

57
00:03:03,052 --> 00:03:04,210
I brought him fancy liquor.

58
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,251
He's not home.

59
00:03:05,331 --> 00:03:06,411
Stop acting.

60
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:07,491
Go home.

61
00:03:08,251 --> 00:03:09,490
What do you mean

62
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,412
by stop acting?

63
00:03:10,492 --> 00:03:11,930
Qian Hao, stop pretending.

64
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,050
I heard what you said

65
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,331
to Song Ran.

66
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,451
You've regretted

67
00:03:15,531 --> 00:03:16,331
being with me

68
00:03:16,411 --> 00:03:17,490
for a long time.

69
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,650
If it weren't for

70
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,930
my family background,

71
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,410
you wouldn't bother with me.

72
00:03:21,771 --> 00:03:23,651
You even humiliated me.

73
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,890
No wonder you wouldn't

74
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:26,771
get intimate

75
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:28,091
with me.

76
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:29,291
You use your mom and kids

77
00:03:29,371 --> 00:03:30,050
to pressure me

78
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:32,091
and stay in contact with Xu Kaixin.

79
00:03:32,531 --> 00:03:33,610
Listen, Qian Hao,

80
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,252
I won't

81
00:03:34,332 --> 00:03:35,810
cling to you.

82
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:36,890
Let's get a divorce.

83
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:39,131
You can remarry Xu Kaixin.

84
00:03:39,211 --> 00:03:40,011
You can have

85
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:40,852
a happy family.

86
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:42,251
Your mom can have her grandson.

87
00:03:42,331 --> 00:03:43,610
Come on, what do you mean?

88
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,452
When did I ever...

89
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:45,650
Check your phone.

90
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:46,412
Sure, then.

91
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:47,610
- I did nothing.
- Check!

92
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,536
Check your phone.

93
00:03:48,536 --> 00:03:49,210
I never said

94
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:50,328
- what you said.
- You see.

95
00:03:50,328 --> 00:03:51,331
It's impossible.

96
00:03:51,331 --> 00:03:52,411
No way.

97
00:03:52,491 --> 00:03:53,491
I...

98
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:01,930
It's only because

99
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,770
Hu Xiaojiao's family background

100
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:05,490
is better than Xu Kaixin's

101
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,411
and her uncle

102
00:04:06,411 --> 00:04:08,632
can help me at work.

103
00:04:08,632 --> 00:04:09,850
Otherwise,

104
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,091
I wouldn't have divorced Xu Kaixin.

105
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,850
No, no, honey.

106
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:21,688
Y-You got me wrong.

107
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:22,691
I was drunk

108
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:23,530
and lost it.

109
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,290
I don't remember

110
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:25,251
what I said.

111
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:27,491
I misspoke after a few drinks.

112
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:28,530
Guys talk nonsense

113
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,170
after they get drunk, right?

114
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,170
This is not

115
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,170
my true thought.

116
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,131
Honey, trust me.

117
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:33,971
I won't drink.

118
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:36,050
Don't touch me.

119
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,250
Let go.

120
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:38,810
Qian Hao.

121
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:40,012
How dare you

122
00:04:40,092 --> 00:04:41,170
lay a finger on Xiaojiao?

123
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,530
No, I didn't, Uncle.

124
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,251
Look, I...

125
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:44,132
I hold the item.

126
00:04:44,212 --> 00:04:45,490
I can't...

127
00:04:46,131 --> 00:04:47,371
I brought you liquor.

128
00:04:47,451 --> 00:04:48,610
Who cares?

129
00:04:49,091 --> 00:04:50,131
Enough.

130
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:51,730
The door is open.

131
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,970
Stop shouting.

132
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:54,251
The neighbors

133
00:04:54,331 --> 00:04:56,211
might think something happened.

134
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,611
Take it away.

135
00:04:57,691 --> 00:04:58,411
Go home

136
00:04:58,491 --> 00:04:59,650
and solve your problem.

137
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:00,451
Leave.

138
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,250
Uncle, Aunt, I'm not leaving.

139
00:05:09,211 --> 00:05:10,011
Aunt.

140
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:11,052
I told you.

141
00:05:11,132 --> 00:05:12,491
Go home now.

142
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:13,850
I don't want to go...

143
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,211
Hurry up.

144
00:05:17,971 --> 00:05:19,290
Stop making a scene here.

145
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:20,810
Aunt, sorry for the trouble.

146
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:25,050
The door is locked.

147
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,610
I'll compensate...

148
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:35,211
Where are the kids?

149
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,370
- Dad.
- Dad.

150
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,171
Let's go home.

151
00:05:42,251 --> 00:05:43,530
Did you two behave?

152
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,410
Yeah.

153
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,050
Here, your backpacks.

154
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,491
Mom, Dad, thank you.

155
00:05:47,571 --> 00:05:48,850
I'll take them home.

156
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:49,531
Well,

157
00:05:49,611 --> 00:05:50,930
have a good rest.

158
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,810
Alright, let's go home.

159
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:54,210
Grandpa and Grandma are tired.

160
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,290
Why not

161
00:05:55,451 --> 00:05:56,891
stay for dinner?

162
00:05:56,971 --> 00:05:58,290
Yeah, stay for dinner.

163
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,051
No, thanks.

164
00:05:59,131 --> 00:06:01,170
I'll get them something to eat.

165
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,730
Say bye to Grandpa and Grandma.

166
00:06:02,891 --> 00:06:03,612
Bye, sweeties.

167
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:04,792
- Bye, Grandpa, Grandma.
- Bye, Grandpa, Grandma.

168
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:06,232
Be good, okay?

169
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:07,371
- Let's go.
- Listen to Dad.

170
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:08,051
Dad, I'm off.

171
00:06:08,131 --> 00:06:08,731
Be good.

172
00:06:08,811 --> 00:06:09,850
Say bye to your auntie.

173
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,096
- Bye, Auntie.
- Bye, Auntie.

174
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:15,970
Mom, Dad, see you around.

175
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:16,891
Alright.

176
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,050
Take care.

177
00:06:22,651 --> 00:06:24,491
You were so against it

178
00:06:24,571 --> 00:06:26,691
when we tried to make you a couple.

179
00:06:26,771 --> 00:06:28,410
Now you're jealous?

180
00:06:28,691 --> 00:06:29,528
Too late.

181
00:06:29,528 --> 00:06:31,064
Stop talking nonsense!

182
00:06:31,064 --> 00:06:31,611
Me?

183
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:33,131
- You're clueless.
- Enough.

184
00:06:33,211 --> 00:06:34,571
Enough.

185
00:06:34,571 --> 00:06:35,251
I really hope

186
00:06:35,251 --> 00:06:36,371
you can talk nicely

187
00:06:36,451 --> 00:06:37,531
to each other

188
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,256
for one day.

189
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:41,691
She won't admit it.

190
00:06:41,771 --> 00:06:42,771
Alright, stop.

191
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,210
Slow down.

192
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:45,090
- Be careful.
- Okay.

193
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,008
Okay.

194
00:06:48,971 --> 00:06:50,211
Hurry up.

195
00:06:52,331 --> 00:06:52,932
Dad.

196
00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:54,811
You haven't hugged me for a long time.

197
00:06:54,891 --> 00:06:56,691
Dad, hug me.

198
00:06:57,011 --> 00:06:58,211
No, hug me.

199
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,490
I'm older. Hug me first.

200
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,811
No, Grandpa said that

201
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:03,492
you should

202
00:07:03,572 --> 00:07:04,651
be considerate to me.

203
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:05,692
Dad.

204
00:07:05,772 --> 00:07:07,650
Who will you hug first, me or her?

205
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,211
Dad, I'll be mad if you don't hug me.

206
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:11,490
Enough.

207
00:07:11,571 --> 00:07:12,371
I'll hug you both.

208
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:12,970
Okay?

209
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,050
Come on.

210
00:07:14,651 --> 00:07:17,050
Popeye the Sailor.

211
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,728
D-Dad, are you alright?

212
00:07:20,728 --> 00:07:21,490
Are you alright?

213
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,210
Hurry.

214
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,691
Help me up.

215
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:26,211
I hurt my back.

216
00:07:26,744 --> 00:07:27,864
Dad, are you okay?

217
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:28,571
Are you okay?

218
00:07:28,651 --> 00:07:29,252
Wait.

219
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:30,370
Get down first.

220
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,611
Dad, are you okay?

221
00:07:31,611 --> 00:07:32,850
Dad, are you okay?

222
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:35,011
I'm okay. I hurt my back.

223
00:07:35,448 --> 00:07:36,770
Dad, are you okay?

224
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:37,492
I'm okay.

225
00:07:37,572 --> 00:07:38,650
Let me sit for a while.

226
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,730
Let me sit here.

227
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:42,930
Help!

228
00:07:44,472 --> 00:07:45,272
Wait.

229
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:47,131
Xiaomi.

230
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:50,370
- Xiaomi, stop it.
- Don't touch me.

231
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:52,290
- Don't touch me.
- Dami is doing homework.

232
00:07:52,370 --> 00:07:53,371
Okay, Lili.

233
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:54,330
Dami is studying.

234
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:55,252
Keep it down.

235
00:07:55,332 --> 00:07:56,451
Stop chasing...

236
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,050
Stop chasing me.

237
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,050
Stop.

238
00:08:00,211 --> 00:08:01,650
Xiaomi, stop chasing me. No.

239
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:02,331
That's it.

240
00:08:02,411 --> 00:08:03,608
I can't do it anymore.

241
00:08:04,011 --> 00:08:04,931
I'm about to collapse.

242
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:05,851
Please.

243
00:08:05,851 --> 00:08:07,571
Xu Kaixin, control your son.

244
00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:09,131
Qian Xiaomi, one...

245
00:08:10,131 --> 00:08:11,730
Stop counting.

246
00:08:16,451 --> 00:08:17,971
Not bad, Xu Kaixin.

247
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,131
One thing conquers another.

248
00:08:22,651 --> 00:08:23,331
Experts

249
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:24,730
wouldn't approve of

250
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:26,131
your approach.

251
00:08:26,211 --> 00:08:27,491
It's the 21st century.

252
00:08:27,571 --> 00:08:29,611
Experts can stop giving advice.

253
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:30,572
Besides, if we don't

254
00:08:30,652 --> 00:08:32,131
discipline our kids now,

255
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:32,771
they'll learn

256
00:08:32,851 --> 00:08:34,211
a lesson the hard way one day.

257
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,171
Impressive.

258
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,010
Has Mei Chengyi contacted you?

259
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,130
No.

260
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,050
He won't kiss

261
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,130
and run, will he?

262
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,171
I'm not at a loss either.

263
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,370
He won't call the police, right?

264
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:00,131
Don't laugh

265
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:02,370
as if I'm a creepy person.

266
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:03,891
Don't be modest.

267
00:09:03,971 --> 00:09:05,048
As if?

268
00:09:05,048 --> 00:09:05,971
That's the truth.

269
00:09:06,051 --> 00:09:07,130
You are creepy by nature.

270
00:09:08,931 --> 00:09:09,931
Xiaomi.

271
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:10,732
Let's play.

272
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:12,051
Don't run around.

273
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,530
Come on, dinner is ready.

274
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,130
Red feathers in the boiled water.

275
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,130
Peel the egg clean and nice.

276
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,810
Very creative.

277
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,832
But don't write that during the exam.

278
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,051
Dad.

279
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,650
What happened to your face?

280
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,931
Are you hurt?

281
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,212
Where?

282
00:09:37,292 --> 00:09:39,250
Here.

283
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:46,370
It's nothing.

284
00:09:46,451 --> 00:09:47,971
I got scraped there.

285
00:09:50,171 --> 00:09:51,171
Dig in.

286
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,370
Xu Kaixin.

287
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:17,291
I'll get your slippers.

288
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:25,091
Mom.

289
00:10:25,912 --> 00:10:27,352
You're back, son.

290
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,691
What's this?

291
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,968
I got it from a feng shui master.

292
00:10:30,968 --> 00:10:32,408
This is Lord Guan.

293
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:34,170
Look.

294
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:34,852
Why did you

295
00:10:34,932 --> 00:10:36,131
get a statue of Guan Yu

296
00:10:36,211 --> 00:10:37,720
home? You...

297
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,490
What's her problem?

298
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:40,851
How can she treat me

299
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:41,931
like this?

300
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:43,288
Come on, this statue...

301
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:44,850
What's wrong?

302
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,091
What is it now?

303
00:10:46,171 --> 00:10:46,890
Are you...

304
00:10:47,091 --> 00:10:48,371
Qian Hao, spare me, please.

305
00:10:48,451 --> 00:10:49,050
If it goes on

306
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:49,691
like this,

307
00:10:49,771 --> 00:10:51,331
I'll end up in an asylum

308
00:10:51,411 --> 00:10:52,091
one day!

309
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:53,812
Mom, what did you do?

310
00:10:53,812 --> 00:10:55,130
Why did you get all this?

311
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,080
The master said,

312
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,490
stick these things for seven days,

313
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,400
and you'll get your luck.

314
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,731
Mom, we just talked this morning.

315
00:11:02,811 --> 00:11:04,530
Didn't you learn anything?

316
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,570
Why did you

317
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:06,872
buy these and that statue?

318
00:11:06,872 --> 00:11:08,171
Can Guan Yu

319
00:11:08,171 --> 00:11:09,092
solve our problem?

320
00:11:09,172 --> 00:11:10,570
I spent 20,000 yuan.

321
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,930
I won't ask you to pay.

322
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,691
Just let it be for a while.

323
00:11:14,232 --> 00:11:15,352
I'll tear them all off.

324
00:11:15,704 --> 00:11:17,610
- No.
- Just don't fan the flames.

325
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,130
- No, Xiaojiao.
- You stop...

326
00:11:19,451 --> 00:11:20,611
Calm down.

327
00:11:20,691 --> 00:11:22,211
Calm down. Everyone.

328
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:23,130
Don't make a fuss.

329
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,770
Take it out on me, okay?

330
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,490
Hu Xiaojiao.

331
00:11:27,691 --> 00:11:28,372
Hu Xiaojiao.

332
00:11:28,452 --> 00:11:29,690
This is nothing fancy.

333
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:30,491
I can do it too.

334
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:32,051
What do you mean? Mom.

335
00:11:32,131 --> 00:11:33,091
Mom, calm down.

336
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:34,171
You...

337
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,811
When will you be done?

338
00:11:41,571 --> 00:11:42,252
It will be

339
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:43,611
after 1 AM.

340
00:11:43,691 --> 00:11:45,051
I was busy during the day.

341
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,010
There are many orders today.

342
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:51,971
You've finished the whole plate!

343
00:11:52,971 --> 00:11:54,130
Aren't you dieting?

344
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:57,530
I'll diet tomorrow.

345
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,731
Your son

346
00:11:59,811 --> 00:12:00,850
exhausted me.

347
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,251
I'll come with you
to deliver the cake shop

348
00:12:06,331 --> 00:12:07,331
the day after next.

349
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:09,411
No need, I'm almost done.

350
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:11,650
The landlord is eager to get it back.

351
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,371
He won't look

352
00:12:12,451 --> 00:12:13,451
for trouble.

353
00:12:15,171 --> 00:12:15,771
So you will

354
00:12:15,851 --> 00:12:17,370
only take orders online?

355
00:12:17,691 --> 00:12:18,770
No way.

356
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:19,971
I've decided.

357
00:12:20,211 --> 00:12:20,971
I'm going back

358
00:12:21,051 --> 00:12:21,930
to that subway

359
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:22,971
station.

360
00:12:23,051 --> 00:12:24,530
Anyway, we have a car now.

361
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,050
Once I get my driver's license,

362
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,371
I'll set up a stall banner

363
00:12:27,451 --> 00:12:28,891
over the trunk and sell

364
00:12:28,971 --> 00:12:30,530
pastries and sandwiches

365
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,931
in the morning.

366
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:33,170
I calculated it.

367
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,491
If I do it for two hours,

368
00:12:34,571 --> 00:12:35,291
the turnover

369
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:36,610
will be around 500 yuan.

370
00:12:36,691 --> 00:12:37,451
The online orders

371
00:12:37,531 --> 00:12:38,690
will be about

372
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,332
800 yuan.

373
00:12:39,412 --> 00:12:41,051
Minus 200 yuan for costs.

374
00:12:41,931 --> 00:12:43,770
You'll make 20,000 yuan a month.

375
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:46,010
Not bad.

376
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:47,331
You'll be rich.

377
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,251
It sounds like a step down,

378
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:50,290
from shop owner

379
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,570
to street vendor.

380
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,010
Our alumni might

381
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,010
laugh at me.

382
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,971
Why do you care?

383
00:12:59,051 --> 00:12:59,851
Seriously.

384
00:12:59,931 --> 00:13:00,852
You know what?

385
00:13:00,932 --> 00:13:02,571
This is solid cash flow.

386
00:13:03,211 --> 00:13:04,450
Amid corporate reforms,

387
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,571
mid-level executives are being laid off.

388
00:13:06,691 --> 00:13:07,372
Those show-offs

389
00:13:07,452 --> 00:13:08,491
from college may appear

390
00:13:08,571 --> 00:13:09,290
to be successful,

391
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,130
but in reality,

392
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,131
they have both mortgages and car loans

393
00:13:12,211 --> 00:13:13,050
and are struggling

394
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,130
to get by.

395
00:13:16,691 --> 00:13:18,250
Are you going to the class reunion?

396
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:20,250
Of course.

397
00:13:20,691 --> 00:13:21,650
Why wouldn't I go?

398
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,131
I'm not the one who cheated.

399
00:13:23,211 --> 00:13:24,250
I'm not afraid.

400
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,650
Then I'll go too.

401
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,170
I'll also warn Song Ran

402
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,370
not to mess with me.

403
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:31,890
Song Ran?

404
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:35,650
I haven't heard of him for a while.

405
00:13:36,091 --> 00:13:37,451
You're in touch again?

406
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,051
Well...

407
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:41,451
You know.

408
00:13:41,691 --> 00:13:42,531
He suddenly

409
00:13:42,611 --> 00:13:44,170
added me on WeChat.

410
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,530
Then he texted me.

411
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,491
I blocked him but he did it again.

412
00:13:48,571 --> 00:13:49,770
Then I was like...

413
00:13:50,171 --> 00:13:50,852
I don't know.

414
00:13:50,932 --> 00:13:52,010
It's just confusing.

415
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,730
Don't tell me

416
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:57,691
you're getting

417
00:13:57,771 --> 00:13:58,931
back together.

418
00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:03,211
No way.

419
00:14:03,411 --> 00:14:04,890
I have my moral principles.

420
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,291
He was

421
00:14:06,371 --> 00:14:07,931
so close to Qian Hao

422
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:08,931
and chose

423
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:11,411
to cover for him when he cheated.

424
00:14:11,691 --> 00:14:13,130
You are the company you keep.

425
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:15,130
Birds of a feather.

426
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:19,370
Actually,

427
00:14:19,931 --> 00:14:21,130
I really envy you.

428
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,370
Look at you.

429
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,730
You act like an idiot.

430
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,971
You've been hurt in a relationship,

431
00:14:31,051 --> 00:14:32,170
but you can still

432
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,770
fearlessly pursue love.

433
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,971
So carefree

434
00:14:35,811 --> 00:14:36,811
and naive.

435
00:14:37,331 --> 00:14:38,411
You envy me?

436
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:39,771
Don't tell me

437
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:41,530
your parents are pushing you again.

438
00:14:45,691 --> 00:14:46,770
Bingo.

439
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:49,610
It's intense this time.

440
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,170
Do you know what my mom said?

441
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,331
My mom said

442
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:55,010
that men aren't important

443
00:14:55,571 --> 00:14:57,131
and it's okay to get a divorce

444
00:14:57,211 --> 00:14:58,770
as long as I manage to have a kid.

445
00:14:58,931 --> 00:15:00,211
They can raise the kid for me.

446
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,290
Come on.

447
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,530
Are they crazy?

448
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,491
So, I'm going to run away from home

449
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,130
and fight against them.

450
00:15:07,211 --> 00:15:08,331
That's why...

451
00:15:08,411 --> 00:15:09,450
Yeah, I know

452
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:10,451
this is probably

453
00:15:10,531 --> 00:15:12,011
our tacit understanding.

454
00:15:12,091 --> 00:15:13,211
I know you'll welcome me

455
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,770
to stay here.

456
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,650
Kaixin.

457
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,731
Mr. Li, Mrs. Li,

458
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:24,450
your daughter

459
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,252
is at my place.

460
00:15:25,332 --> 00:15:26,731
- She said you pressured her.
- Xu Kaixin.

461
00:15:26,811 --> 00:15:27,811
Xu Kaixin.

462
00:15:27,971 --> 00:15:28,770
Xu Kaixin.

463
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:29,731
You lackey.

464
00:15:29,811 --> 00:15:30,331
This is

465
00:15:30,411 --> 00:15:31,252
the end of

466
00:15:31,332 --> 00:15:32,571
our friendship.

467
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,450
M-Move out.

468
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,571
Don't stay here.

469
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,971
I move out?

470
00:15:37,051 --> 00:15:38,050
Bye. Don't contact me.

471
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,411
I should move out?

472
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,730
Except for her chronic illness,

473
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,130
your mother is fine.

474
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,571
Make sure she avoids

475
00:15:55,691 --> 00:15:56,770
mood swings.

476
00:15:59,211 --> 00:16:00,730
Hu Xiaojiao, right?

477
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,331
It's just low blood sugar.

478
00:16:03,411 --> 00:16:04,491
She'll be fine with

479
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:05,571
some IV drips.

480
00:16:05,931 --> 00:16:07,370
But a pregnant woman

481
00:16:07,571 --> 00:16:09,050
must eat properly.

482
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:10,811
It's still in the early stages.

483
00:16:11,411 --> 00:16:13,050
This morning's ultrasound check

484
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,211
says it's just over four weeks.

485
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,851
The fetal position

486
00:16:16,931 --> 00:16:17,930
hasn't stabilized.

487
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,731
Families argue sometimes.

488
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:21,370
Try to avoid it.

489
00:16:25,331 --> 00:16:26,850
Doctor, who's pregnant?

490
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:28,770
Ma'am,

491
00:16:29,051 --> 00:16:30,050
just you two patients.

492
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,000
You're over 60.

493
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,370
Do you think it's you?

494
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:33,770
Wait.

495
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:36,530
Are you saying

496
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:39,010
that Hu Xiaojiao is pregnant?

497
00:16:40,051 --> 00:16:41,650
I can see her check-up report

498
00:16:41,730 --> 00:16:43,010
in the system.

499
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:43,972
She came here

500
00:16:44,052 --> 00:16:45,130
in the morning.

501
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:46,250
What's wrong?

502
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,530
Didn't she tell you

503
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,610
the good news?

504
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,290
Great news.

505
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,690
This is great!

506
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:54,370
I must tell everyone.

507
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,611
Son,

508
00:16:56,691 --> 00:16:58,650
those offerings were truly magical.

509
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:01,171
She conceived right after I bought them.

510
00:17:03,211 --> 00:17:04,611
The heavens showed its spirit.

511
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:05,970
Thank you.

512
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:06,651
Bodhisattva.

513
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:08,170
No, Lord Guan...

514
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,250
Whoever it is...

515
00:17:09,851 --> 00:17:10,811
What a miracle.

516
00:17:10,891 --> 00:17:11,891
What a miracle.

517
00:17:12,851 --> 00:17:13,851
Doctor,

518
00:17:14,891 --> 00:17:16,131
can you tell

519
00:17:16,211 --> 00:17:17,371
the baby's gender?

520
00:17:17,451 --> 00:17:18,810
Ma'am, I can't disclose that.

521
00:17:37,971 --> 00:17:39,210
It seems our son-in-law

522
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:40,490
is really in love

523
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:42,520
with Xu Kaixin.

524
00:17:44,371 --> 00:17:45,651
This is unexpected.

525
00:17:46,411 --> 00:17:47,531
We wanted to

526
00:17:47,611 --> 00:17:49,810
make her back down.

527
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:54,250
But we backed down instead.

528
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,490
What else can we do?

529
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:57,770
If I had to choose

530
00:17:58,131 --> 00:17:59,131
between Xu and Youyou,

531
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,131
I'd also choose Xu without hesitation.

532
00:18:01,931 --> 00:18:03,611
But our daughter

533
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,810
is acting weird.

534
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:06,451
She used to

535
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:07,930
get mad when I asked her

536
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,290
to give it a try with Chengyi.

537
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,490
But now, she's upset

538
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:11,930
to see him

539
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,131
dating someone.

540
00:18:13,851 --> 00:18:16,050
She didn't know what she wanted.

541
00:18:16,371 --> 00:18:18,411
It's too late to regret it.

542
00:18:19,611 --> 00:18:20,891
Don't say that.

543
00:18:21,651 --> 00:18:23,411
Xu may have passed the first test,

544
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:24,970
but she still has to

545
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:25,970
win the kids' hearts.

546
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:26,651
Besides,

547
00:18:26,731 --> 00:18:28,490
she has two children.

548
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,091
If the four kids

549
00:18:30,171 --> 00:18:31,171
don't get along,

550
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,330
it won't work out.

551
00:18:35,371 --> 00:18:36,530
Are you saying...

552
00:18:36,611 --> 00:18:37,691
Another test is needed.

553
00:18:38,171 --> 00:18:39,771
Get the kids to hang out

554
00:18:39,851 --> 00:18:41,211
and see how it goes.

555
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:44,570
Makes sense.

556
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:46,411
Meanwhile,

557
00:18:46,491 --> 00:18:47,611
I'll ask Youyou

558
00:18:47,691 --> 00:18:48,930
what her problem is.

559
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:50,691
Forget it, let me do it.

560
00:18:51,411 --> 00:18:53,411
I don't want you to fight again.

561
00:19:14,411 --> 00:19:15,770
Dad, is it here?

562
00:19:16,171 --> 00:19:17,092
- No, lower.
- Here?

563
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:18,371
No, a bit lower.

564
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,490
Here?

565
00:19:19,611 --> 00:19:20,690
To the left.

566
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,171
It's here.

567
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,211
Yu'an.

568
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:25,690
Enough.

569
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,770
Give it to me.

570
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,050
- I'll do it myself.
- But we...

571
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,851
Go to sleep.

572
00:19:30,931 --> 00:19:31,970
I'll be fine.

573
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,250
Go to bed.

574
00:19:34,851 --> 00:19:35,851
Hurry up.

575
00:19:37,931 --> 00:19:38,931
Brushed your teeth?

576
00:20:03,052 --> 00:20:05,040
(Father-in-law)

577
00:20:08,931 --> 00:20:09,571
Dad.

578
00:20:09,651 --> 00:20:10,651
Hello, Chengyi.

579
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,851
Ask Xu

580
00:20:11,931 --> 00:20:13,770
to bring her kids over next week.

581
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:14,971
Let's meet again.

582
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,490
Wait...

583
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,611
Isn't it a bit unnecessary?

584
00:20:19,691 --> 00:20:20,851
How's it unnecessary?

585
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:22,051
Yu'an and Yule

586
00:20:22,131 --> 00:20:22,851
should get along

587
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:23,691
with her kids.

588
00:20:23,771 --> 00:20:25,050
That's very important.

589
00:20:25,330 --> 00:20:26,451
It's decided then.

590
00:20:44,931 --> 00:20:46,770
(On that date with Xu Kaixin,)

591
00:20:46,931 --> 00:20:48,091
(I confidently said)

592
00:20:48,171 --> 00:20:49,811
(that I would only)

593
00:20:49,891 --> 00:20:51,730
(get remarried for love.)

594
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:53,770
(But tonight,)

595
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,570
(when I faced my true self,)

596
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:56,811
(I sadly discovered)

597
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:57,851
(that I don't)

598
00:20:57,931 --> 00:20:59,651
(deserve love as a middle-aged guy.)

599
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,931
(I couldn't tell whether)

600
00:21:02,411 --> 00:21:04,330
(it was an impulse or love.)

601
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,371
(I could risk everything for love)

602
00:21:06,451 --> 00:21:08,770
(when I was in my twenties.)

603
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:11,171
(But now, I've become)

604
00:21:11,411 --> 00:21:12,770
(such a coward,)

605
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:13,812
(worrying about)

606
00:21:13,892 --> 00:21:15,331
(the pressure of handling)

607
00:21:15,411 --> 00:21:16,371
(four kids)

608
00:21:16,451 --> 00:21:18,451
(if I start dating Xu Kaixin.)

609
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,611
(If I can't handle it,)

610
00:21:21,211 --> 00:21:22,371
(then how do I explain)

611
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,131
(that unexpected kiss?)

612
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:33,810
What's wrong?

613
00:22:33,931 --> 00:22:35,651
You lost the fight with Xiaoxiao

614
00:22:35,851 --> 00:22:37,010
and got kicked out?

615
00:22:37,851 --> 00:22:39,811
She grinds her teeth in her sleep.

616
00:22:39,891 --> 00:22:41,010
It's freaky.

617
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:41,731
I even dream

618
00:22:41,811 --> 00:22:43,211
about myself lying on the plate

619
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,771
of the cannibals,

620
00:22:44,851 --> 00:22:45,372
and they say

621
00:22:45,452 --> 00:22:47,371
that my flesh is too tough to chew.

622
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:49,250
My goodness.

623
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,771
Your bed is the coziest

624
00:22:50,851 --> 00:22:52,411
in the world.

625
00:22:58,451 --> 00:23:00,411
Is there anything you want to tell me?

626
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,250
Not really.

627
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:05,411
Are you in a relationship?

628
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,770
Qian Dami just can't keep a secret.

629
00:23:09,211 --> 00:23:11,010
What does it have to do with her?

630
00:23:11,171 --> 00:23:12,250
You and Li Xiaoxiao

631
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,051
couldn't lower your voice.

632
00:23:14,131 --> 00:23:15,651
Everyone in the building heard you.

633
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:17,091
If I couldn't hear that,

634
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:18,411
I might as well be deaf.

635
00:23:23,371 --> 00:23:24,571
Actually,

636
00:23:24,651 --> 00:23:26,730
it's nothing serious yet.

637
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:29,131
We're just seeing each other.

638
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,451
Got a photo?

639
00:23:34,712 --> 00:23:35,416
(Mei Chengyi)

640
00:23:42,651 --> 00:23:44,331
Stop teasing me with the photos

641
00:23:44,411 --> 00:23:45,411
of celebrities.

642
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,250
He's not a celebrity.

643
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,171
He's even more handsome in person.

644
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:51,131
Fine, I believe you.

645
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:53,570
Go to sleep.

646
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:56,971
You have to get up to work on the oven.

647
00:23:58,330 --> 00:23:59,651
Sleep as much as you can.

648
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:29,131
Don't be scared.

649
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,531
Xiaojiao, you finally woke up.

650
00:24:32,611 --> 00:24:34,611
We were worried sick.

651
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:36,851
Seriously.

652
00:24:36,931 --> 00:24:38,250
Why didn't you tell Qian Hao

653
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,971
that you're pregnant?

654
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,531
I bet you wanted

655
00:24:41,611 --> 00:24:43,450
to surprise us.

656
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:44,530
Right?

657
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,050
I don't want to...

658
00:24:52,851 --> 00:24:53,931
I-I don't want to...

659
00:24:54,891 --> 00:24:55,891
I don't want to...

660
00:24:56,451 --> 00:24:57,451
Calm down.

661
00:24:57,691 --> 00:24:59,411
You're pregnant.

662
00:24:59,971 --> 00:25:01,091
Our future is still

663
00:25:01,171 --> 00:25:02,371
ahead of us.

664
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:08,171
It's okay.

665
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:10,010
I want a divorce.

666
00:25:11,530 --> 00:25:12,530
I want a divorce.

667
00:25:13,691 --> 00:25:14,691
Divorce.

668
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:17,292
I want a divorce.

669
00:25:17,372 --> 00:25:18,611
No, no.

670
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,090
Together forever.

671
00:25:21,048 --> 00:25:21,912
Forever.

672
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:26,970
Fantastic.

673
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:28,810
She's pregnant.

674
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,650
How lucky.

675
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,771
How can I be

676
00:25:33,851 --> 00:25:35,010
so lucky?

677
00:25:35,691 --> 00:25:36,292
Pregnant...

678
00:25:36,372 --> 00:25:38,530
I will have a grandson very soon.

679
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,010
Xiaojiao.

680
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:41,690
You did such a good job.

681
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:42,650
You know?

682
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,171
- Come on.
- Mom.

683
00:25:45,131 --> 00:25:46,371
Xiaojiao is pregnant

684
00:25:46,451 --> 00:25:47,570
and needs to rest.

685
00:25:51,211 --> 00:25:51,931
Xiaojiao.

686
00:25:52,011 --> 00:25:53,530
Go ahead.

687
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,131
Rest well.

688
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,171
I'll make you a nice breakfast.

689
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:00,171
Thank goodness.

690
00:26:00,371 --> 00:26:01,451
Thank you, heavens.

691
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,411
My luck is improving.

692
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,290
Qian Hao.

693
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,611
I know I did you wrong.

694
00:27:00,891 --> 00:27:02,530
If you want a divorce,

695
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:06,211
I will do it.

696
00:27:12,010 --> 00:27:13,451
Do you hear me, Qian Hao?

697
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:16,330
If you want a divorce,

698
00:27:16,611 --> 00:27:18,010
I will do it.

699
00:27:21,371 --> 00:27:22,211
Did you hear me?

700
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:23,971
I'm willing to divorce you.

701
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:16,371
I'm sorry.

702
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,371
I'm sorry.

703
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,611
I'm sorry.

704
00:28:25,971 --> 00:28:27,411
I'm sorry, Qian Hao.

705
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:31,930
I'm sorry.

706
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:32,571
I'm sorry.

707
00:28:32,651 --> 00:28:33,651
I'm sorry.

708
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:39,651
I'm sorry.

709
00:28:52,152 --> 00:28:53,010
Mom.

710
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:55,131
You're back? It's early.

711
00:29:08,891 --> 00:29:10,250
You look so sleepy.

712
00:29:10,611 --> 00:29:12,770
You stayed up all night again?

713
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,170
I didn't want to.

714
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,851
But I couldn't sleep.

715
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:28,971
You came home early.

716
00:29:29,371 --> 00:29:30,411
Hello, Chengyi.

717
00:29:30,971 --> 00:29:31,971
Youyou.

718
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:33,371
I tried to hold

719
00:29:33,451 --> 00:29:35,010
Yu'an and Yule and hurt my back.

720
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,531
I'm not very mobile right now.

721
00:29:36,611 --> 00:29:37,650
Could you

722
00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:38,810
or your parents

723
00:29:39,371 --> 00:29:41,171
take them to kindergarten?

724
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,611
That's unfortunate.

725
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:47,050
Alright, I got it.

726
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:50,090
Is it Chengyi?

727
00:29:50,971 --> 00:29:51,971
What's wrong?

728
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,451
He told me to take
Yu'an and Yule to school.

729
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:57,211
He exercised too much yesterday

730
00:29:57,691 --> 00:29:58,851
and hurt his back.

731
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,931
He hurt his back?

732
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:09,371
Let's eat.

733
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,810
How did he hurt his back?

734
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:19,730
You talk too much.

735
00:30:27,891 --> 00:30:29,770
- Come on
- Wait, Youyou.

736
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,931
Do you have a problem with me?

737
00:30:32,851 --> 00:30:33,572
You don't need to

738
00:30:33,652 --> 00:30:34,690
explain anything to me.

739
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,292
But please

740
00:30:35,372 --> 00:30:36,650
don't lie to me.

741
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:37,731
- I...
- You claim

742
00:30:37,811 --> 00:30:39,051
that Xu Kaixin is only

743
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:40,490
helping you out.

744
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,810
This is how...

745
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,410
she helps you?

746
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:47,570
What's the problem?

747
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,170
I feel like you

748
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,250
let my sister down.

749
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,491
Of course,

750
00:30:51,571 --> 00:30:52,770
you can date someone.

751
00:30:52,891 --> 00:30:53,690
But

752
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:54,691
don't act like

753
00:30:54,771 --> 00:30:56,051
you can't forget about my sister

754
00:30:56,131 --> 00:30:57,411
while you're dating

755
00:30:58,211 --> 00:30:59,211
other women.

756
00:30:59,851 --> 00:31:00,612
So hypocritical.

757
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:01,690
You got me wrong.

758
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:02,690
Yesterday, I...

759
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:03,691
Be quiet.

760
00:31:03,771 --> 00:31:05,211
Not in front of the kids.

761
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:07,372
Alright.

762
00:31:07,452 --> 00:31:08,650
M-My bad, alright?

763
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:09,490
My bad.

764
00:31:09,691 --> 00:31:10,891
Alright, get going.

765
00:31:10,971 --> 00:31:11,971
Let's go.

766
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:14,010
Bye, Dad.

767
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,090
Bye, Dad.

768
00:31:15,411 --> 00:31:16,411
Be careful.

769
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:39,211
Way to go, Xu Kaixin.

770
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:08,568
Xiaojiao,

771
00:32:08,568 --> 00:32:10,131
I'm making dumplings for you.

772
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,250
What are you doing?

773
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,171
Where are you going with the luggage?

774
00:32:15,411 --> 00:32:16,211
You're expecting

775
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:17,410
my grandchild.

776
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,410
Don't go.

777
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:19,490
What are you doing?

778
00:32:19,611 --> 00:32:20,611
Qian Hao.

779
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:22,290
Son, come out.

780
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:23,210
Xiaojiao is...

781
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:23,892
Stop it.

782
00:32:23,972 --> 00:32:25,131
Qian Hao, hurry.

783
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:26,571
She's pregnant.

784
00:32:26,651 --> 00:32:28,131
It's okay, Mom, don't worry.

785
00:32:28,611 --> 00:32:29,851
Let me go.

786
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:31,690
Be careful

787
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,171
of the child.

788
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,330
Let me go.

789
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,971
Qian Hao, let go.

790
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,330
Qian Hao.

791
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,570
Let me go.

792
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,771
What are you doing? Let me go.

793
00:32:48,851 --> 00:32:49,851
You.

794
00:32:51,891 --> 00:32:53,250
You better calm down.

795
00:32:53,451 --> 00:32:54,410
Otherwise,

796
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:55,931
I don't know

797
00:32:55,931 --> 00:32:57,171
what I might do.

798
00:33:13,931 --> 00:33:14,931
Qian Hao.

799
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,730
I know I did you wrong.

800
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:20,131
I...

801
00:33:27,211 --> 00:33:28,010
I...

802
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:30,131
- Don't touch me.
- Let's get a divorce.

803
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,410
Let each other go.

804
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,290
- Don't touch me.
- Tell me what you want.

805
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,011
You

806
00:33:37,091 --> 00:33:38,530
cheated on me.

807
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:41,691
I have to show "appreciation".

808
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,930
I didn't mean to.

809
00:33:44,010 --> 00:33:45,730
I swear I didn't mean to.

810
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:46,891
I was drunk.

811
00:33:46,971 --> 00:33:49,091
I woke up and it had already happened.

812
00:33:49,171 --> 00:33:51,131
I didn't even know.

813
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,691
I didn't mean to let you down.

814
00:33:54,411 --> 00:33:56,250
That's why I proposed a divorce.

815
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,131
Once you agree...

816
00:33:59,931 --> 00:34:00,931
No way.

817
00:34:01,490 --> 00:34:03,730
T-Then what do you want?

818
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,690
Give birth to the child.

819
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:15,010
You are crazy.

820
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:16,600
- No, I'm not.
- You are!

821
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,331
No, I'm not!

822
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,130
I know what I'm doing.

823
00:34:20,451 --> 00:34:22,490
The doctor says my mom
only has two years left.

824
00:34:22,931 --> 00:34:24,731
Give birth to the child.

825
00:34:24,811 --> 00:34:26,490
Let my mom pass away in peace.

826
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:30,050
Then you can do whatever you want.

827
00:34:32,731 --> 00:34:33,970
What about the child, then?

828
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,371
I don't even know

829
00:34:35,451 --> 00:34:36,731
who the father is.

830
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,410
If I give birth just to

831
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:39,171
please your mom,

832
00:34:39,251 --> 00:34:40,051
then I'll have to

833
00:34:40,131 --> 00:34:41,331
be responsible forever.

834
00:34:41,931 --> 00:34:43,291
Who can you blame?

835
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,771
You did it to yourself.

836
00:34:50,251 --> 00:34:51,490
Fine, I'll do it.

837
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,650
I'll do it.

838
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,650
Hu Xiaojiao.

839
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:00,211
Are you trying to fool me

840
00:35:00,291 --> 00:35:01,971
and get an abortion later?

841
00:35:03,891 --> 00:35:06,211
I'm warning you. Think carefully.

842
00:35:06,291 --> 00:35:08,090
I would be really angry.

843
00:35:09,610 --> 00:35:10,651
Don't pressure me

844
00:35:10,731 --> 00:35:11,771
with your uncle again.

845
00:35:12,712 --> 00:35:13,432
He broke the rules

846
00:35:13,432 --> 00:35:15,130
for me many times these years.

847
00:35:15,210 --> 00:35:16,691
If I go all out against him,

848
00:35:16,771 --> 00:35:17,971
he'll have a hard time.

849
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:20,971
Qian Hao, let's not do this.

850
00:35:21,170 --> 00:35:22,130
I really love you.

851
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:23,211
Don't touch me.

852
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:23,892
I'm just...

853
00:35:23,972 --> 00:35:25,050
Don't touch me.

854
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,530
Xiaojiao.

855
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:29,010
Hao.

856
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,811
Don't fight.

857
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:31,812
Arguing

858
00:35:31,892 --> 00:35:33,944
is not good for the baby.

859
00:35:39,411 --> 00:35:41,690
Mom, we're fine.

860
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,050
Louder.

861
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,490
Mom,

862
00:35:50,251 --> 00:35:52,291
we're fine. Don't worry.

863
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,450
Hello.

864
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:47,970
What happened to that

865
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,691
high-rent tenant you introduced?

866
00:36:49,771 --> 00:36:50,531
He's completely

867
00:36:50,611 --> 00:36:51,851
ignoring my calls.

868
00:36:52,411 --> 00:36:54,090
I have completed the handover

869
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,650
with the previous tenant.

870
00:36:55,851 --> 00:36:57,931
I have already paid the compensation.

871
00:37:03,291 --> 00:37:04,971
Listen to him. Something's wrong.

872
00:37:05,811 --> 00:37:06,410
What's wrong?

873
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,291
Listen.

874
00:37:07,411 --> 00:37:09,411
He did give me a bit of a deposit,

875
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,130
but it's just enough to cover

876
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,251
the compensation.

877
00:37:12,411 --> 00:37:13,210
You...

878
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:14,170
What?

879
00:37:14,291 --> 00:37:15,650
He also doesn't answer your calls?

880
00:37:15,771 --> 00:37:16,332
Does he

881
00:37:16,412 --> 00:37:17,931
have any integrity at all?

882
00:37:18,891 --> 00:37:20,376
Listen... Ah?

883
00:37:21,251 --> 00:37:23,170
You'll find me a new tenant

884
00:37:23,731 --> 00:37:24,970
and drop the rent lower

885
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,050
than the market price?

886
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,691
You guys joined hands

887
00:37:27,771 --> 00:37:28,891
to set me up, huh?

888
00:37:28,971 --> 00:37:29,692
I swear I won't

889
00:37:29,772 --> 00:37:30,811
work with you people

890
00:37:30,891 --> 00:37:32,371
ever again!

891
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:34,650
What is all this?

892
00:37:43,451 --> 00:37:44,451
Xu.

893
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:45,731
Well,

894
00:37:45,891 --> 00:37:47,371
here's what I think.

895
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,331
We've been working together

896
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,891
for so many years,

897
00:37:50,971 --> 00:37:52,771
and we've gotten along well, right?

898
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:53,812
I'm feeling

899
00:37:53,892 --> 00:37:55,251
a bit reluctant

900
00:37:55,411 --> 00:37:56,811
to rent the shop to someone else.

901
00:37:57,251 --> 00:37:58,680
You see.

902
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,088
You can't easily find

903
00:38:00,088 --> 00:38:01,050
a suitable place.

904
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:01,772
Besides,

905
00:38:01,852 --> 00:38:03,096
you have many

906
00:38:03,096 --> 00:38:04,090
regular customers.

907
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,811
It would be a pity to move away.

908
00:38:05,971 --> 00:38:06,732
How about this?

909
00:38:06,812 --> 00:38:08,970
Just keep renting my place.

910
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:09,970
To show my sincerity,

911
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,170
I'll spare you the deposit.

912
00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:11,891
Alright?

913
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,090
Sir,

914
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:14,552
did someone

915
00:38:14,552 --> 00:38:15,771
offer a high rent

916
00:38:15,851 --> 00:38:17,010
just to drive me away?

917
00:38:17,331 --> 00:38:18,411
Not at all.

918
00:38:18,731 --> 00:38:20,251
It just suddenly occurred to me

919
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:21,771
that we had bonded.

920
00:38:21,851 --> 00:38:22,936
In that case,

921
00:38:22,936 --> 00:38:24,251
lower the rent.

922
00:38:24,331 --> 00:38:25,080
Kaixin may

923
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,451
consider it.

924
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:28,610
Well...

925
00:38:29,931 --> 00:38:32,610
How about 100 yuan less?

926
00:38:32,971 --> 00:38:34,130
I'm very sincere.

927
00:38:34,371 --> 00:38:36,731
I'm full of flaws.

928
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:38,570
My only merit is that

929
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,891
I never regret my decisions.

930
00:38:39,971 --> 00:38:40,971
Come on.

931
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,570
How about 200 yuan?

932
00:38:42,771 --> 00:38:43,771
Two hundred.

933
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:45,731
- Come on.
- Are you serious?

934
00:38:45,811 --> 00:38:46,451
My sincerity...

935
00:38:46,531 --> 00:38:48,210
This is my bottom line.

936
00:38:48,731 --> 00:38:49,691
So someone paid

937
00:38:49,771 --> 00:38:50,891
to drive you away.

938
00:38:50,971 --> 00:38:51,611
Once you left,

939
00:38:51,691 --> 00:38:52,771
he broke his promise.

940
00:38:52,851 --> 00:38:54,211
This is weird.

941
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:56,251
Could it be Qian Hao?

942
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:57,212
Let's ask

943
00:38:57,292 --> 00:38:58,411
the landlord.

944
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,690
Let's go.

945
00:39:25,851 --> 00:39:26,650
Come on.

946
00:39:26,811 --> 00:39:28,130
Xiaojiao, dig in.

947
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,530
You really need

948
00:39:29,610 --> 00:39:30,931
nutrition right now.

949
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,371
Mom, I have no appetite.

950
00:39:34,291 --> 00:39:35,371
Mom tells you to eat.

951
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:37,090
Just eat then.

952
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:11,530
Go ahead.

953
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,650
Don't mind her.

954
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,731
What's wrong with you?

955
00:40:14,811 --> 00:40:16,211
Things are different now.

956
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:18,008
She's pregnant.

957
00:40:18,008 --> 00:40:18,931
What's so different?

958
00:40:19,011 --> 00:40:20,331
You weren't so nervous

959
00:40:20,411 --> 00:40:21,931
when Xu Kaixin was pregnant.

960
00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:27,050
Time has changed.

961
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:28,450
I was in good health

962
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,371
and had plenty of time left.

963
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,771
But now, I don't know

964
00:40:32,371 --> 00:40:33,971
if we can have Xiaomi back.

965
00:40:35,251 --> 00:40:36,172
The heavens

966
00:40:36,252 --> 00:40:38,530
blessed Xiaojiao with a child.

967
00:40:40,251 --> 00:40:41,690
If I get to see

968
00:40:42,251 --> 00:40:43,291
my grandchild,

969
00:40:43,371 --> 00:40:44,610
I can die in peace.

970
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,650
Enough, Mom.

971
00:40:46,771 --> 00:40:48,010
Stop saying that.

972
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,291
It upsets me.

973
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,851
Xiaojiao will give birth.

974
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:06,772
And I'll try

975
00:41:06,852 --> 00:41:08,331
to bring Xiaomi home.

976
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:10,010
Kaixin is also attending

977
00:41:10,251 --> 00:41:11,251
the class reunion.

978
00:41:11,371 --> 00:41:12,451
I'll talk to her again.

979
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:17,210
I'm not feeling well.

980
00:41:17,331 --> 00:41:18,970
I won't go to the class reunion.

981
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,050
Go by yourself.

982
00:41:20,530 --> 00:41:21,650
No way.

983
00:41:22,331 --> 00:41:23,610
You're my wife.

984
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:26,331
You'll go wherever I go.

985
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,010
Don't think about running away.

986
00:41:34,891 --> 00:41:37,050
Come on, let's eat.

987
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,610
You must eat and stay healthy.

988
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:40,690
Come on.

989
00:41:41,851 --> 00:41:43,210
Take care of yourself.

990
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:44,650
Come on.

991
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,010
Dig in.

992
00:42:26,891 --> 00:42:28,211
So it was Qian Hao

993
00:42:28,291 --> 00:42:28,970
all along.

994
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:29,930
You're divorced.

995
00:42:30,010 --> 00:42:30,851
Why is he still

996
00:42:30,931 --> 00:42:31,931
causing you trouble?

997
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:33,292
He just wants

998
00:42:33,372 --> 00:42:34,530
custody of Xiaomi.

999
00:42:34,610 --> 00:42:35,971
He wants to ruin my shop

1000
00:42:36,291 --> 00:42:37,291
and make me

1001
00:42:37,371 --> 00:42:38,771
unable to support two kids.

1002
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:40,892
Then he's really

1003
00:42:40,972 --> 00:42:42,610
shooting himself in the foot.

1004
00:42:42,731 --> 00:42:43,851
During the class reunion,

1005
00:42:43,931 --> 00:42:44,851
I'll make sure he gets

1006
00:42:44,931 --> 00:42:45,931
what he deserves.

1007
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:46,772
I was going to

1008
00:42:46,852 --> 00:42:48,570
let go of the past.

1009
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,251
Since he won't stop,

1010
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:51,811
I won't show mercy.

1011
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:53,210
What's your plan?

1012
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:54,971
I'll sue him

1013
00:42:55,811 --> 00:42:58,010
to redistribute marital property.

1014
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:00,090
Since he's so stingy,

1015
00:43:00,251 --> 00:43:01,891
I'll make sure he pays

1016
00:43:01,971 --> 00:43:03,650
every cent he owes.

1017
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:05,090
Go for it.
