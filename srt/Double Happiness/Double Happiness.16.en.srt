Lili.

18
00:01:57,493 --> 00:01:58,493
Get lost.

19
00:01:58,652 --> 00:02:00,333
I won't sleep with a hopeless romantic,

20
00:02:00,773 --> 00:02:01,973
in case you'll infect me

21
00:02:02,053 --> 00:02:03,213
and make me dumb.

22
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:06,133
Lili.

23
00:02:06,413 --> 00:02:07,333
Does it still hurt?

24
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:08,413
Yes.

25
00:02:09,532 --> 00:02:10,812
You need more beating.

26
00:02:12,493 --> 00:02:13,493
If you don't

27
00:02:13,573 --> 00:02:14,933
bring him back,

28
00:02:15,013 --> 00:02:16,852
don't expect me to be nice to you.

29
00:02:16,932 --> 00:02:18,693
He hasn't even passed my test,

30
00:02:18,773 --> 00:02:20,173
how can I bring him back for you?

31
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,132
He's about to lose his job.

32
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:26,293
Lose his job?

33
00:02:27,053 --> 00:02:29,092
A man raising two kids.

34
00:02:29,252 --> 00:02:30,612
If he can't find a job,

35
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,933
you'd end up being responsible?

36
00:02:32,013 --> 00:02:32,853
So, you see.

37
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:34,253
We're not at that stage yet where

38
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:36,932
we can introduce each other
to our families.

39
00:02:37,132 --> 00:02:38,013
Actually, losing a job

40
00:02:38,093 --> 00:02:39,412
is not that scary.

41
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,413
I want to take this opportunity

42
00:02:41,493 --> 00:02:42,653
to see if he's the type

43
00:02:42,733 --> 00:02:43,933
who gets tougher

44
00:02:44,013 --> 00:02:45,292
with setbacks

45
00:02:45,372 --> 00:02:47,013
and be responsible for the family.

46
00:02:47,252 --> 00:02:48,493
After what I've been through,

47
00:02:48,573 --> 00:02:49,254
let me tell you,

48
00:02:49,334 --> 00:02:51,612
I've learned from experience

49
00:02:51,692 --> 00:02:52,733
and grown wiser.

50
00:02:53,532 --> 00:02:54,653
No wise man

51
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:55,972
would say they are wise.

52
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,372
At your college reunion today,

53
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:00,732
did you meet

54
00:03:00,812 --> 00:03:02,412
anyone you didn't want to see?

55
00:03:03,092 --> 00:03:04,532
I did.

56
00:03:05,652 --> 00:03:06,892
Hu Xiaojiao came to me,

57
00:03:06,972 --> 00:03:08,933
saying to give Qian Hao back to me,

58
00:03:09,013 --> 00:03:10,972
so we can have a family reunion.

59
00:03:31,972 --> 00:03:33,733
Qian Hao, are you insane?

60
00:03:34,053 --> 00:03:34,934
Sitting there

61
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,053
without making a sound.

62
00:03:36,293 --> 00:03:37,613
Xu Kaixin

63
00:03:37,773 --> 00:03:38,732
bothered me,

64
00:03:38,812 --> 00:03:40,093
and you scared me.

65
00:03:40,173 --> 00:03:40,852
If you want me to

66
00:03:40,932 --> 00:03:41,533
move out,

67
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:42,374
just say it.

68
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:43,733
Why do you do this?

69
00:03:46,053 --> 00:03:47,532
Qian Hao, I'm talking to you.

70
00:03:49,372 --> 00:03:50,372
Qian Hao.

71
00:03:55,773 --> 00:03:56,773
Qian Hao.

72
00:04:02,532 --> 00:04:03,733
Qian Hao, what's wrong?

73
00:04:18,013 --> 00:04:19,013
What's wrong with you?

74
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:22,773
I'm about to lose my mom.

75
00:04:25,453 --> 00:04:26,453
No way.

76
00:04:27,092 --> 00:04:29,373
Isn't your mom quite energetic?

77
00:04:33,532 --> 00:04:35,092
I went to the hospital today,

78
00:04:37,732 --> 00:04:38,732
the doctor said

79
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,573
her cancer cells have spread.

80
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:49,773
She has only two months

81
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:53,172
left now.

82
00:04:58,333 --> 00:04:59,333
She is

83
00:05:01,412 --> 00:05:03,293
hanging on

84
00:05:03,373 --> 00:05:05,092
just to see her grandson.

85
00:05:11,013 --> 00:05:13,292
I can't let her die.

86
00:05:22,373 --> 00:05:24,172
Can you help me, Xiaojiao?

87
00:05:26,813 --> 00:05:27,813
Help me.

88
00:05:29,092 --> 00:05:31,013
What I said before was all out of anger.

89
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:36,373
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:38,052 --> 00:05:39,052
I was wrong.

91
00:05:40,013 --> 00:05:41,253
Every prenatal check-up,

92
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:42,373
I'll go with you.

93
00:05:44,013 --> 00:05:45,013
I will treat him

94
00:05:45,453 --> 00:05:46,532
and raise him

95
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:47,732
like my own son.

96
00:05:51,373 --> 00:05:53,412
Please don't leave me.

97
00:05:56,092 --> 00:05:58,333
Please don't leave me.

98
00:05:59,933 --> 00:06:01,572
Please.

99
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,933
Please.

100
00:06:03,492 --> 00:06:04,933
Please

101
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,972
don't leave me.

102
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:14,573
Calm down.

103
00:06:16,532 --> 00:06:17,813
Okay, I'm with you.

104
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,573
I'm with you.

105
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,333
Calm down.

106
00:06:23,492 --> 00:06:24,773
Okay, I'm with you.

107
00:06:27,532 --> 00:06:29,573
No one is pitiful without cause.

108
00:06:29,773 --> 00:06:31,572
Look at Qian Hao's family,

109
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:33,133
turning good days into this.

110
00:06:33,213 --> 00:06:34,253
Who to blame?

111
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:36,253
They reap what they sow.

112
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:36,854
Exactly.

113
00:06:36,934 --> 00:06:38,773
People shouldn't do evil.

114
00:06:40,092 --> 00:06:42,173
By the way, Qian Hao called me,

115
00:06:42,253 --> 00:06:44,012
saying his mom misses
the two grandchildren

116
00:06:44,092 --> 00:06:45,172
so much,

117
00:06:45,453 --> 00:06:47,532
and asked me to bring the kids over
on the weekend.

118
00:06:47,612 --> 00:06:48,374
Anyway,

119
00:06:48,454 --> 00:06:50,212
they have paid me child support,

120
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:51,292
so I agreed.

121
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:52,573
Two grandchildren?

122
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:55,652
I think she just wants
to see her grandson.

123
00:06:55,732 --> 00:06:56,453
I can't

124
00:06:56,533 --> 00:06:57,853
let Xiaomi go alone.

125
00:06:57,933 --> 00:06:59,612
Dami would be upset if she found out.

126
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:01,333
When they got there,

127
00:07:01,492 --> 00:07:03,253
if she and Qian Hao were biased,

128
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:04,452
Dami would feel worse.

129
00:07:04,532 --> 00:07:05,572
Listen, I am

130
00:07:05,652 --> 00:07:06,732
quite clever.

131
00:07:06,933 --> 00:07:07,972
Guess what?

132
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,012
I made Qian Hao transfer 8,000 yuan

133
00:07:10,092 --> 00:07:11,773
to me as a deposit.

134
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:13,332
If Dami

135
00:07:13,412 --> 00:07:14,532
comes back happily,

136
00:07:14,612 --> 00:07:16,092
I'll refund the money to him.

137
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:17,133
If Dami

138
00:07:17,213 --> 00:07:18,733
suffers any grievance,

139
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:19,813
I'll take the money

140
00:07:19,893 --> 00:07:21,773
for Dami as her dowry.

141
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:23,933
You make Dami like a money grubber.

142
00:07:24,052 --> 00:07:25,933
As if she's not.

143
00:07:26,412 --> 00:07:27,412
That's true.

144
00:07:27,652 --> 00:07:30,052
She is good at everything,

145
00:07:30,453 --> 00:07:31,613
but on these matters,

146
00:07:31,693 --> 00:07:32,693
she is quite sensitive,

147
00:07:32,813 --> 00:07:34,373
much better than her mom.

148
00:07:34,453 --> 00:07:35,213
In the future,

149
00:07:35,293 --> 00:07:36,572
no one could fool her.

150
00:07:36,652 --> 00:07:38,373
Why involved me?

151
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,092
Master.

152
00:07:49,133 --> 00:07:50,373
Are you married?

153
00:07:52,693 --> 00:07:54,013
When I was young...

154
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:56,292
No.

155
00:07:57,453 --> 00:07:58,453
Once,

156
00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:00,333
a girl loved me so much.

157
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:02,292
She was beautiful

158
00:08:02,652 --> 00:08:03,652
and kind.

159
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:06,492
Once?

160
00:08:07,172 --> 00:08:08,373
Then it didn't end well.

161
00:08:09,453 --> 00:08:10,453
Got dumped?

162
00:08:11,292 --> 00:08:13,292
Do you look down on me?

163
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,573
Indeed, I am not handsome,

164
00:08:16,732 --> 00:08:18,292
but I am quite manly.

165
00:08:18,813 --> 00:08:20,172
Back when I was young,

166
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,013
many girl fell for me

167
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:23,693
and tried to

168
00:08:23,773 --> 00:08:25,212
pursue me.

169
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:26,492
I had to reject them all.

170
00:08:27,732 --> 00:08:29,933
I'm so impressed, Master.

171
00:08:30,013 --> 00:08:31,013
Right?

172
00:08:35,293 --> 00:08:38,173
Until I met her,

173
00:08:38,813 --> 00:08:39,813
I finally understood

174
00:08:40,693 --> 00:08:41,933
that love

175
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,092
is not that ordinary.

176
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:47,333
If she really stands

177
00:08:47,413 --> 00:08:48,413
in front of you

178
00:08:48,813 --> 00:08:49,892
and gives you a smile,

179
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:52,374
you would

180
00:08:52,454 --> 00:08:53,972
want to give her the whole world.

181
00:08:56,413 --> 00:08:57,413
Since you loved her,

182
00:08:57,892 --> 00:08:59,492
why did you two break up?

183
00:09:01,132 --> 00:09:02,693
Because you didn't have money?

184
00:09:03,612 --> 00:09:05,933
Did she hate your job at the cemetery?

185
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:08,133
No, no.

186
00:09:08,213 --> 00:09:09,333
I don't deserve her.

187
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:12,772
But it's pretty good now.

188
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:14,772
She got married

189
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:16,573
and has kids.

190
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,612
She's living quite a good life.

191
00:09:19,533 --> 00:09:20,533
It's quite nice.

192
00:09:24,533 --> 00:09:26,772
Alright, let's call it a day.

193
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:29,173
Tonight,

194
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:31,412
I'll set up a camp bed

195
00:09:31,492 --> 00:09:32,333
in the office

196
00:09:32,413 --> 00:09:33,453
and keep you accompany

197
00:09:33,533 --> 00:09:34,533
for two more days.

198
00:09:35,173 --> 00:09:37,173
By the way,
if you need anything at night,

199
00:09:37,693 --> 00:09:38,692
don't knock on the door.

200
00:09:38,772 --> 00:09:39,413
Here,

201
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:41,333
knocking on the door
can scare me to death.

202
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:42,932
Just call.

203
00:09:43,012 --> 00:09:44,012
Okay?

204
00:09:45,053 --> 00:09:46,453
You've been here for 20 years,

205
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:47,573
and you're still scared?

206
00:09:49,892 --> 00:09:51,132
Of course.

207
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,333
If I wasn't scared,

208
00:09:52,653 --> 00:09:54,092
I wouldn't be here.

209
00:09:56,772 --> 00:09:58,413
It's too profound to understand.

210
00:09:59,813 --> 00:10:00,813
You don't need to.

211
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,173
As long as you're not scared.

212
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:05,333
I'm not.

213
00:10:05,492 --> 00:10:06,853
When I was watching short videos,

214
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:07,972
I saw a saying.

215
00:10:08,213 --> 00:10:09,213
It said,

216
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:11,333
every ghost you fear

217
00:10:11,413 --> 00:10:12,772
is missed

218
00:10:12,852 --> 00:10:14,533
by someone.

219
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:17,573
My sister is there with me.

220
00:10:18,132 --> 00:10:19,132
What am I scared?

221
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,053
Makes sense.

222
00:10:23,492 --> 00:10:26,892
Then let's have a good sleep

223
00:10:27,132 --> 00:10:28,132
and have sweet dreams.

224
00:10:28,492 --> 00:10:29,213
Good night.

225
00:10:29,293 --> 00:10:30,293
Good night.

226
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,132
I'll go to bed.

227
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:36,053

Hello, what's up?

248
00:13:20,892 --> 00:13:22,052
I want to meet

249
00:13:22,132 --> 00:13:23,132
with Mr. Lin.

250
00:13:23,453 --> 00:13:24,253
Then come to

251
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,052
Bihai Mansion.

252
00:13:25,132 --> 00:13:26,013
Mr. Lin will leave

00:13:26,093 --> 00:13:27,132
in half an hour.

254
00:13:27,533 --> 00:13:28,772
Hurry. We won't wait for you.

255
00:13:29,213 --> 00:13:30,213
Half an hour?

256
00:13:30,612 --> 00:13:31,612
I...

257
00:13:33,293 --> 00:13:34,972
Alright, I'll head over right now.

258
00:13:46,813 --> 00:13:47,972
Hurry up.

259
00:13:48,132 --> 00:13:49,254
Can't get dressed yourself?

260
00:13:49,334 --> 00:13:50,653
Dad is waiting for you.

261
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,333
Xiaomi, come on.

262
00:13:56,012 --> 00:13:56,732
Lili.

263
00:13:57,012 --> 00:13:58,052
Bring the ID Cards of

264
00:13:58,132 --> 00:13:58,854
Dami and Xiaomi.

265
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:00,252
Qian Hao is taking them to play.

266
00:14:11,252 --> 00:14:12,333
Dad is here.

267
00:14:12,892 --> 00:14:13,772
Mom, Dad is here.

268
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:14,852
Hurry up.

269
00:14:17,012 --> 00:14:18,132
You didn't go to bed early,

270
00:14:18,132 --> 00:14:19,892
yet stayed up watching TV

271
00:14:19,972 --> 00:14:20,972
and the tablet.

272
00:14:21,092 --> 00:14:22,533
Can't get up now, right?

273
00:14:22,933 --> 00:14:25,293
We're here. I can see my grandson now.

274
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:28,372
Remember what I told you.

275
00:14:28,693 --> 00:14:29,652
You can't

276
00:14:29,732 --> 00:14:30,772
ignore Dami.

277
00:14:31,012 --> 00:14:32,892
If Dami is upset, she'll make a fuss.

278
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,532
If it happens, Xu Kaixin won't

279
00:14:34,612 --> 00:14:35,813
let us see them again.

280
00:14:36,852 --> 00:14:38,453
I know. I am not that stupid.

281
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:40,173
I can pretend it.

282
00:14:40,372 --> 00:14:41,372
As you wish.

283
00:14:41,573 --> 00:14:42,293
Yes, I know.

284
00:14:42,373 --> 00:14:43,813
You say this every time.

285
00:14:44,972 --> 00:14:45,492
Okay.

286
00:14:45,933 --> 00:14:46,933
Yesterday,

287
00:14:47,372 --> 00:14:48,972
I really wasn't in the mood.

288
00:14:49,132 --> 00:14:50,172
Before we go up,

289
00:14:50,252 --> 00:14:51,573
let's have a talk.

290
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:53,852
My dad

291
00:14:54,173 --> 00:14:55,972
just did a square dance.

292
00:14:56,173 --> 00:14:57,573
He didn't do anything else, right?

293
00:14:57,852 --> 00:14:59,653
Do you have to make such a fuss?

294
00:15:00,972 --> 00:15:03,292
It doesn't matter
that you embarrassed yourself.

295
00:15:03,372 --> 00:15:04,733
But you got yourself upset.

296
00:15:04,813 --> 00:15:06,573
Don't ruin your health like this.

297
00:15:09,693 --> 00:15:11,292
That day, I went to the square.

298
00:15:11,372 --> 00:15:12,173
I wanted to see

299
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:13,612
what they were doing.

300
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:15,132
They're not dancing at all.

301
00:15:15,693 --> 00:15:16,973
They just

302
00:15:17,053 --> 00:15:18,372
hugged each other.

303
00:15:19,053 --> 00:15:19,813
Let me tell you,

304
00:15:19,893 --> 00:15:20,892
your dad was holding

305
00:15:20,972 --> 00:15:21,734
that hag tightly.

306
00:15:21,814 --> 00:15:23,573
Their lips were almost touching.

307
00:15:23,892 --> 00:15:24,772
Alright.

308
00:15:24,852 --> 00:15:25,613
Got it.

309
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:26,293
In that case,

310
00:15:26,373 --> 00:15:27,772
it's right for you to hit him.

311
00:15:27,852 --> 00:15:28,574
He deserves it.

312
00:15:28,654 --> 00:15:29,613
But you hit yourself.

313
00:15:29,693 --> 00:15:30,692
Why's that?

314
00:15:30,772 --> 00:15:32,132
Don't you feel pain?

315
00:15:33,092 --> 00:15:34,292
If I hit him,

316
00:15:34,372 --> 00:15:36,172
I would end up being
in the police station.

317
00:15:36,252 --> 00:15:37,772
What about you and Xiaomi?

318
00:15:38,453 --> 00:15:39,772
I'm not that stupid.

319
00:15:40,693 --> 00:15:41,374
At this moment,

320
00:15:41,454 --> 00:15:42,933
your mind is quite clear.

321
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:45,333
Dad.

322
00:15:46,732 --> 00:15:47,652
He's coming.

323
00:15:47,732 --> 00:15:48,453
Coming.

324
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:50,173
Remember what I told you.

325
00:15:52,413 --> 00:15:53,413
Dad.

326
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:55,852
Xiaomi.

327
00:15:56,732 --> 00:15:57,412
Let me hug you.

328
00:15:57,492 --> 00:15:58,492
Grandma.

329
00:16:01,213 --> 00:16:02,372
My dear grandson.

330
00:16:02,653 --> 00:16:03,653
Grandma.

331
00:16:03,933 --> 00:16:04,653
Xiaomi.

332
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:05,772
Did you miss me?

333
00:16:05,852 --> 00:16:06,773
- I miss you.
- Grandma.

334
00:16:06,773 --> 00:16:07,892
Are you happy to see me?

335
00:16:07,972 --> 00:16:08,693
Yes.

336
00:16:08,972 --> 00:16:10,132
I really miss you.

337
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:11,933
I miss you too, grandma.

338
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,372
You've grown taller.

339
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:15,772
Taller.

340
00:16:17,573 --> 00:16:19,453
Finally, I see my dear grandson.

341
00:16:22,533 --> 00:16:24,132
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

342
00:16:53,012 --> 00:16:54,012
Hello.

343
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:54,972
Xiaojiao.

344
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:56,972
I discussed with your aunt

345
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:58,852
about the divorce.

346
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:00,573
It's better early than late.

347
00:17:01,012 --> 00:17:02,972
First, we need to deal with the child.

348
00:17:03,492 --> 00:17:05,293
It's more harmful
to your health if delayed.

349
00:17:05,373 --> 00:17:07,172
So, in a few days,

350
00:17:07,252 --> 00:17:08,573
your aunt will take you

351
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:09,972
to the hospital for a check-up.

352
00:17:10,252 --> 00:17:11,133
And then...

353
00:17:11,213 --> 00:17:12,213
Uncle.

354
00:17:19,252 --> 00:17:20,252
You went back yesterday.

355
00:17:20,772 --> 00:17:22,133
Qian Hao caused you trouble again?

356
00:17:22,572 --> 00:17:23,253
No, no.

357
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,613
Uncle, I...

358
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:29,653
Say something.

359
00:17:30,292 --> 00:17:31,653
What's going on?

360
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:34,653
Xiaojiao is

361
00:17:34,733 --> 00:17:35,972
speaking hesitantly

362
00:17:36,052 --> 00:17:37,252
and can't even speak clearly.

363
00:17:37,693 --> 00:17:38,692
Hello.

364
00:17:38,772 --> 00:17:39,772
Give me.

365
00:17:42,332 --> 00:17:43,054
Hello.

366
00:17:43,134 --> 00:17:44,212
Hu Xiaojiao, what's wrong?

367
00:17:44,292 --> 00:17:45,292
So indecisive.

368
00:17:45,653 --> 00:17:46,653
Did you

369
00:17:47,052 --> 00:17:48,373
change your mind again?

370
00:17:48,653 --> 00:17:49,453
Listen,

371
00:17:49,533 --> 00:17:50,853
you two can't

372
00:17:50,972 --> 00:17:51,932
live a proper life.

373
00:17:52,012 --> 00:17:52,814
If it continues,

374
00:17:52,894 --> 00:17:53,972
there will be more trouble.

375
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:55,892
Being decisive.

376
00:17:55,972 --> 00:17:57,012
Understand me?

377
00:17:57,332 --> 00:17:58,332
Aunt.

378
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:02,732
Give me an answer.

379
00:18:02,812 --> 00:18:03,812
Oh my.

380
00:18:06,693 --> 00:18:08,812
Qian Hao apologized to me yesterday.

381
00:18:08,972 --> 00:18:09,493
After all,

382
00:18:09,573 --> 00:18:11,212
we've been together

383
00:18:11,292 --> 00:18:12,813
for so many years,

384
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:15,453
so I want to give him another chance.

385
00:18:22,252 --> 00:18:23,252
Aunt.

386
00:18:28,373 --> 00:18:29,413
What to do?

387
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:32,653
What's going on?

388
00:18:33,572 --> 00:18:35,012
What could it be?

389
00:18:35,732 --> 00:18:36,772
After Hu Xiaojiao

390
00:18:36,893 --> 00:18:38,173
was coaxed by Qian Hao,

391
00:18:38,693 --> 00:18:39,933
she changed her mind again,

392
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:41,613
planning to bear the child

393
00:18:41,693 --> 00:18:43,093
and live happily

394
00:18:43,173 --> 00:18:44,173
with Qian Hao.

395
00:18:44,572 --> 00:18:46,133
What's wrong with her?

396
00:18:47,173 --> 00:18:48,173
I'm furious.

397
00:18:49,173 --> 00:18:50,812
Forget it. Don't mind her anymore.

398
00:18:51,532 --> 00:18:53,133
I've warned her many times.

399
00:18:53,252 --> 00:18:54,252
If she got fooled,

400
00:18:54,332 --> 00:18:55,453
she deserves it.

401
00:18:55,693 --> 00:18:56,693
Let's eat.

402
00:19:03,052 --> 00:19:04,133
(Tianya: I messaged you,)

403
00:19:04,213 --> 00:19:05,972
(yet you didn't reply.
I'm a bit worried.)

404
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:07,373
(Nothing happened, right?)

405
00:19:15,933 --> 00:19:17,532
(Hu Xiaojiao:
I made up with my husband.)

406
00:19:18,133 --> 00:19:19,133
(Sorry.)

407
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:21,332
(Let's stop chatting.)

408
00:19:23,012 --> 00:19:24,413
Almost!

409
00:19:25,173 --> 00:19:26,173
My money is gone!

410
00:19:26,772 --> 00:19:27,772
What?

411
00:19:28,012 --> 00:19:29,212
She made up with her husband

412
00:19:29,292 --> 00:19:30,572
and won't chat with me anymore.

413
00:19:32,893 --> 00:19:33,893
Then it's fine.

414
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:35,453
Reply like this.

415
00:19:36,173 --> 00:19:38,972
Okay, then I won't disturb you anymore.

416
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,413
(Tianya: But remember,)

417
00:19:40,572 --> 00:19:42,173
(as long as you need me,)

418
00:19:42,332 --> 00:19:43,613
(I'm always here.)

419
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:51,373
(Hu Xiaojiao: Thank you.)

420
00:19:51,572 --> 00:19:53,213
You need to be patient.

421
00:19:53,413 --> 00:19:55,252
There's a high chance of success.

422
00:19:55,332 --> 00:19:56,013
Hear that?

423
00:19:56,093 --> 00:19:57,453
- Yes.
- What do you call this?

424
00:19:57,533 --> 00:19:59,373
Women who can be coaxed
by their husbands

425
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:00,853
are our targets,

426
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,013
who are easily fooled.

427
00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:03,732
- Understand?
- Yes.

428
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:05,413
They'll never figure it out

429
00:20:05,732 --> 00:20:06,932
those who are always

430
00:20:07,012 --> 00:20:07,693
patient with them

431
00:20:07,773 --> 00:20:09,173
are a bunch of frauds.

432
00:20:11,595 --> 00:20:15,081
(Wealth Ranking List)

433
00:20:18,292 --> 00:20:19,292
Honey.

434
00:20:20,252 --> 00:20:21,252
Honey.

435
00:20:29,012 --> 00:20:30,012
Honey.

436
00:20:33,772 --> 00:20:34,772
Honey.

437
00:20:55,613 --> 00:20:56,253
Xiaomi.

438
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,692
Here, buckle up.

439
00:20:57,772 --> 00:21:00,173
Honey, where are you?

440
00:21:00,653 --> 00:21:01,493
I pick up children

441
00:21:01,573 --> 00:21:02,732
for the weekend with my mom.

442
00:21:02,893 --> 00:21:04,732
I'm afraid the children
might bump into you,

443
00:21:04,812 --> 00:21:05,812
so I didn't tell you.

444
00:21:10,453 --> 00:21:11,252
Honey.

445
00:21:11,453 --> 00:21:13,732
What you said last night is true, right?

446
00:21:14,133 --> 00:21:16,212
You said you'll go
for check-ups with me.

447
00:21:16,292 --> 00:21:17,573
He is our child,

448
00:21:17,653 --> 00:21:19,532
and we'll be fine, right?

449
00:21:23,373 --> 00:21:24,972
Okay, you get busy first.

450
00:21:25,252 --> 00:21:26,252
Goodbye, honey.

451
00:21:35,532 --> 00:21:37,452
Do you really miss me?

452
00:21:37,532 --> 00:21:38,094
Yes.

453
00:21:38,174 --> 00:21:39,373
You seem to have lost weight.

454
00:21:39,453 --> 00:21:41,012
I will make you something delicious.

455
00:21:41,772 --> 00:21:43,252
My dear grandson.

456
00:21:43,373 --> 00:21:44,972
I'll make you something delicious.

457
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:48,133
My dear grandson.

458
00:21:51,256 --> 00:21:52,760
(Transfer of 8,000 from Qian Hao,
Received)

459
00:22:00,572 --> 00:22:01,493
Dami.

460
00:22:01,573 --> 00:22:02,773
Come close to me.

461
00:22:02,853 --> 00:22:03,773
Come close to me.

462
00:22:03,853 --> 00:22:04,853
Come close to me.

463
00:22:05,572 --> 00:22:06,692
Yes, come close to me.

464
00:22:06,772 --> 00:22:08,172
I'll make you something delicious.

465
00:22:08,252 --> 00:22:09,572
Tell me what you want to eat.

466
00:22:20,133 --> 00:22:21,413
I will make it for both of you.

467
00:22:21,812 --> 00:22:23,693
- Okay.
- Let's get ready to go.

468
00:22:24,413 --> 00:22:25,413
Xiaomi.

469
00:22:28,133 --> 00:22:29,412
I'll send them back by night.

470
00:22:29,492 --> 00:22:30,492
Don't worry.

471
00:22:32,453 --> 00:22:34,332
Okay, we're leaving.

472
00:22:37,332 --> 00:22:38,332
See you.

473
00:22:52,052 --> 00:22:53,052
Time to get up.

474
00:23:12,332 --> 00:23:13,332
Hungry, right?

475
00:23:14,093 --> 00:23:15,093
Time to eat.

476
00:23:19,613 --> 00:23:21,052
This is delicious.

477
00:23:21,532 --> 00:23:23,292
Eat dog food, less salt.

478
00:23:24,093 --> 00:23:25,093
Eat this.

479
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:52,733
It's this time.

480
00:23:52,813 --> 00:23:53,893
Why isn't she up yet?

481
00:23:55,933 --> 00:23:56,933
Youyou.

482
00:23:58,532 --> 00:23:59,693
Youyou.

483
00:24:08,173 --> 00:24:09,933
Youyou, wake up.

484
00:24:11,693 --> 00:24:12,693
Youyou.

485
00:24:14,812 --> 00:24:15,812
Youyou.

486
00:24:17,893 --> 00:24:19,252
What's wrong?

487
00:24:25,613 --> 00:24:26,613
Youyou.

488
00:24:27,572 --> 00:24:28,572
Youyou.

489
00:24:29,492 --> 00:24:30,693
Youyou, are you okay?

490
00:24:31,693 --> 00:24:32,693
Youyou.

491
00:24:34,772 --> 00:24:36,093
Youyou, you...

492
00:24:44,492 --> 00:24:45,613
What's wrong, Master?

493
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:46,813
You are sleeping

494
00:24:46,893 --> 00:24:48,373
like a pig.

495
00:24:48,453 --> 00:24:50,133
I've almost broken the window and door,

496
00:24:50,213 --> 00:24:51,332
yet didn't you hear a thing?

497
00:24:52,213 --> 00:24:55,053
I drank a bottle of beer yesterday,

498
00:24:55,133 --> 00:24:56,133
and was really sleepy.

499
00:24:57,532 --> 00:24:58,813
I don't know why.

500
00:24:58,893 --> 00:25:00,492
As soon as I come here,

501
00:25:00,972 --> 00:25:02,373
I can sleep especially well.

502
00:25:02,653 --> 00:25:03,732
When I was at home,

503
00:25:03,812 --> 00:25:05,013
I couldn't sleep

504
00:25:05,093 --> 00:25:06,373
for even three hours.

505
00:25:06,453 --> 00:25:07,892
I'm speechless.

506
00:25:07,972 --> 00:25:09,013
Others are too scared

507
00:25:09,093 --> 00:25:10,333
to sleep in the cemetery.

508
00:25:10,413 --> 00:25:11,572
But look at you.

509
00:25:12,292 --> 00:25:13,572
Alright, alright.

510
00:25:13,693 --> 00:25:14,374
Well,

511
00:25:14,454 --> 00:25:15,412
more people coming

512
00:25:15,492 --> 00:25:16,572
than on weekends.

513
00:25:17,133 --> 00:25:18,133
You...

514
00:25:19,693 --> 00:25:21,532
Alright, half hour.

515
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:22,972
No more sleeping.

516
00:25:24,213 --> 00:25:25,213
I'll go on duty.

517
00:25:27,772 --> 00:25:28,772
Thank you, Master.

518
00:26:52,052 --> 00:26:52,613
Ms. Qin.

519
00:26:52,772 --> 00:26:53,293
Here.

520
00:26:53,373 --> 00:26:54,213
You're so late.

521
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:55,893
Mr. Lin is about to go to the airport.

522
00:26:56,093 --> 00:26:56,854
You said

523
00:26:56,934 --> 00:26:58,452
you had to meet today.

524
00:26:58,532 --> 00:27:00,013
The traffic is jammed today.

525
00:27:00,093 --> 00:27:01,172
And the journey is too far.

526
00:27:01,252 --> 00:27:02,533
Mr. Lin is about to go abroad.

527
00:27:02,613 --> 00:27:04,093
He won't be back soon.

528
00:27:04,173 --> 00:27:05,173
So what to do now?

529
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:06,893
Just five minutes left, okay?

530
00:27:09,572 --> 00:27:10,853
How about this?

531
00:27:11,252 --> 00:27:11,973
Ride in my car.

532
00:27:12,053 --> 00:27:13,173
I'll take him there.

533
00:27:13,373 --> 00:27:14,652
About an hour to the airport.

534
00:27:14,732 --> 00:27:16,693
And it is enough for me.

535
00:27:17,373 --> 00:27:18,013
In that case,

536
00:27:18,093 --> 00:27:18,933
I'll tell Mr. Lin

537
00:27:19,013 --> 00:27:20,172
the car has a problem,

538
00:27:20,252 --> 00:27:21,853
needs to be fixed.

539
00:27:22,173 --> 00:27:22,814
I'll try to

540
00:27:22,894 --> 00:27:23,972
buy you some time.

541
00:27:24,093 --> 00:27:25,333
Thank you.

542
00:27:25,413 --> 00:27:26,094
Don't thank me.

543
00:27:26,174 --> 00:27:27,292
You've helped me a lot.

544
00:27:27,373 --> 00:27:28,172
Moreover, you are

545
00:27:28,252 --> 00:27:28,892
raising kids,

546
00:27:28,972 --> 00:27:29,813
which is not easy.

547
00:27:29,893 --> 00:27:30,893
Wait for me.

548
00:27:32,093 --> 00:27:33,252
I'll treat you to a meal.

549
00:27:49,972 --> 00:27:51,133
Call our daughter

550
00:27:51,213 --> 00:27:52,653
and ask her to come back.

551
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:54,533
No one stays at the dorm

552
00:27:54,613 --> 00:27:56,293
over the weekend.

553
00:27:56,373 --> 00:27:57,492
She said

554
00:27:58,572 --> 00:27:59,933
she's busy with work.

555
00:28:00,173 --> 00:28:01,212
She has to tidy up

556
00:28:01,292 --> 00:28:02,453
the dorm over the weekend.

557
00:28:02,613 --> 00:28:03,772
She'll be back next weekend.

558
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:15,532
These two kids!

559
00:28:15,972 --> 00:28:17,133
Why don't they

560
00:28:17,213 --> 00:28:19,052
come over?

561
00:28:20,413 --> 00:28:21,972
They attend classes on weekends.

562
00:28:22,052 --> 00:28:23,292
Didn't you know it?

563
00:28:28,396 --> 00:28:31,512
(Father-in-law)

564
00:28:37,035 --> 00:28:38,584
(Chengyi)

565
00:28:43,413 --> 00:28:44,413
Who is it?

566
00:28:48,012 --> 00:28:49,052
Answer it.

567
00:28:49,292 --> 00:28:50,053
It is so noisy.

568
00:28:50,133 --> 00:28:51,133
Doesn't it bother you?

569
00:28:55,292 --> 00:28:57,292
Do you know who is calling?

570
00:28:57,492 --> 00:28:58,693
A scam call.

571
00:28:59,173 --> 00:29:00,373
Mei Chengyi.

572
00:29:02,613 --> 00:29:03,853
Then answer it.

573
00:29:04,373 --> 00:29:05,373
No way.

574
00:29:06,252 --> 00:29:06,933
If I do,

575
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:09,052
he'll ask us to take care of his kids.

576
00:29:10,252 --> 00:29:10,854
You are really

577
00:29:10,934 --> 00:29:12,173
fussy.

578
00:29:12,613 --> 00:29:13,932
No one is more troublesome

579
00:29:14,012 --> 00:29:15,332
than you.

580
00:29:15,853 --> 00:29:16,813
If the kids don't come,

581
00:29:16,893 --> 00:29:17,692
you complain.

582
00:29:17,772 --> 00:29:18,614
When they do come,

583
00:29:18,694 --> 00:29:20,252
you reject them.

584
00:29:21,292 --> 00:29:22,732
Not at all.

585
00:29:22,893 --> 00:29:24,693
This is playing hard to get.

586
00:29:25,052 --> 00:29:26,532
I am testing his patience.

587
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:28,373
I will let Mei Chengyi know

588
00:29:28,453 --> 00:29:29,772
he can't

589
00:29:30,213 --> 00:29:31,213
leave us.

590
00:29:32,012 --> 00:29:32,733
He can

591
00:29:32,813 --> 00:29:34,732
never leave

592
00:29:35,213 --> 00:29:36,213
the You family.

593
00:29:39,275 --> 00:29:42,333
(Mother-in-law)

594
00:29:47,373 --> 00:29:48,452
Are you insane?

595
00:29:48,532 --> 00:29:49,453
You don't answer it,

596
00:29:49,533 --> 00:29:50,613
why bother my call?

597
00:29:50,693 --> 00:29:51,893
Don't answer it.

598
00:29:52,893 --> 00:29:54,292
Stay calm.

599
00:29:57,572 --> 00:29:59,252
You!

600
00:30:06,572 --> 00:30:08,052
Why aren't they answering the call?

601
00:30:10,123 --> 00:30:11,320
(Xu Kaixin)

602
00:30:30,093 --> 00:30:31,692
You'd better not paint today.

603
00:30:31,772 --> 00:30:32,413
In one minute,

604
00:30:32,493 --> 00:30:33,853
you sighed four or five times.

605
00:30:33,933 --> 00:30:35,333
Your mind is absent.

606
00:30:35,413 --> 00:30:36,693
Exactly.

607
00:30:37,093 --> 00:30:38,373
Dami

608
00:30:38,853 --> 00:30:40,292
has stayed at her dad's house.

609
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,333
But it's the first time

610
00:30:42,413 --> 00:30:43,213
Xiaomi

611
00:30:43,293 --> 00:30:44,853
to be alone with them.

612
00:30:45,373 --> 00:30:47,252
I am so anxious.

613
00:30:47,332 --> 00:30:48,652
Don't worry.

614
00:30:48,732 --> 00:30:49,574
Dami has a phone.

615
00:30:49,654 --> 00:30:51,213
She can call us at any time.

616
00:30:51,532 --> 00:30:53,413
I'm even more worried about Dami.

617
00:30:53,812 --> 00:30:55,693
They cherish boys over girls,

618
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:57,772
might bully Dami.

619
00:30:58,052 --> 00:30:59,053
I still have

620
00:30:59,133 --> 00:31:00,413
Qian Hao's 8,000 yuan.

621
00:31:00,532 --> 00:31:01,213
If he dares to

622
00:31:01,293 --> 00:31:02,293
let his mom bully Dami,

623
00:31:02,373 --> 00:31:03,412
I'll deduct the money,

624
00:31:03,492 --> 00:31:04,773
and never let them

625
00:31:04,853 --> 00:31:05,853
take the kids out again.

626
00:31:14,893 --> 00:31:15,893
Hello.

627
00:31:16,093 --> 00:31:17,212
Kaixin, can you

628
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:17,972
do me a favor?

629
00:31:18,052 --> 00:31:18,814
Mr. Lin is ready.

630
00:31:18,894 --> 00:31:20,213
He will come over later.

631
00:31:20,413 --> 00:31:22,052
Alright, I'll take a call.

632
00:31:22,332 --> 00:31:23,332
Thank you.

633
00:31:23,693 --> 00:31:24,692
Hello.

634
00:31:24,772 --> 00:31:25,533
Go ahead.

635
00:31:25,613 --> 00:31:26,573
Here's the thing.

636
00:31:26,653 --> 00:31:28,412
I have some urgent work.

637
00:31:28,492 --> 00:31:29,492
Right now Yu'an and Yule

638
00:31:29,572 --> 00:31:30,692
are attending a dance class.

639
00:31:30,772 --> 00:31:32,293
It will finish in about an hour.

640
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:33,692
If I go to pick them up,

641
00:31:33,772 --> 00:31:34,653
I might lose

642
00:31:34,733 --> 00:31:36,413
an important opportunity.

643
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,296
You know my situation.

644
00:31:38,392 --> 00:31:40,413
And their grandparents
aren't answering the call.

645
00:31:40,413 --> 00:31:40,972
I wonder

646
00:31:41,052 --> 00:31:41,614
if you can

647
00:31:41,694 --> 00:31:42,853
pick them up

648
00:31:42,933 --> 00:31:43,933
and take care of them.

649
00:31:44,173 --> 00:31:45,173
It's no big deal.

650
00:31:45,413 --> 00:31:46,412
Dami and Xiaomi

651
00:31:46,492 --> 00:31:47,412
are not at home today.

652
00:31:47,492 --> 00:31:49,133
Send me the address.

653
00:31:49,213 --> 00:31:49,933
Don't forget

654
00:31:50,013 --> 00:31:51,453
to mention it to the teacher.

655
00:31:51,653 --> 00:31:52,492
Alright, thank you.

656
00:31:52,572 --> 00:31:53,333
Thank you.

657
00:31:53,413 --> 00:31:54,452
I have to go now.

658
00:31:54,532 --> 00:31:55,333
I'll call the miss

659
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,413
right now.

660
00:31:56,572 --> 00:31:57,333
Alright.

661
00:31:57,413 --> 00:31:58,413
Bye.

662
00:31:59,812 --> 00:32:00,812
What's wrong?

663
00:32:01,413 --> 00:32:02,212
Mei Chengyi asked me

664
00:32:02,292 --> 00:32:03,292
to pick up his kids.

665
00:32:04,413 --> 00:32:06,452
Yesterday you said to test him,

666
00:32:06,532 --> 00:32:07,094
you help him

667
00:32:07,174 --> 00:32:08,453
pick up his kids now?

668
00:32:09,413 --> 00:32:10,653
These are two different things.

669
00:32:11,093 --> 00:32:12,093
In his current situation,

670
00:32:12,173 --> 00:32:13,853
I certainly can't help him financially.

671
00:32:14,012 --> 00:32:14,732
But for us,

672
00:32:14,812 --> 00:32:15,452
taking care of

673
00:32:15,532 --> 00:32:17,333
the kids is the most basic thing.

674
00:32:17,413 --> 00:32:18,773
When I had a car accident,

675
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,413
he came over immediately.

676
00:32:21,853 --> 00:32:22,573
Lili.

677
00:32:22,653 --> 00:32:23,693
Please help me with

678
00:32:23,773 --> 00:32:24,773
the mixer.

679
00:32:24,853 --> 00:32:25,853
No.

680
00:32:27,853 --> 00:32:28,853
Love you.

681
00:32:34,653 --> 00:32:36,133
His kid isn't good.

682
00:32:37,613 --> 00:32:38,374
His youngest son

683
00:32:38,454 --> 00:32:39,492
is not good.

684
00:32:39,732 --> 00:32:41,613
I think he is quite good.

685
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:44,333
We've arrived.

686
00:32:44,413 --> 00:32:45,373
Come on, Xiaomi.

687
00:32:45,453 --> 00:32:46,533
Unfasten the seatbelt.

688
00:32:46,613 --> 00:32:48,613
We're here.

689
00:32:48,693 --> 00:32:50,452
Come on, let's get off.

690
00:32:50,532 --> 00:32:52,972
Let's get off. We're home.

691
00:32:53,213 --> 00:32:54,492
Come on, get off.

692
00:32:56,052 --> 00:32:56,774
Okay.

693
00:32:56,854 --> 00:32:57,853
Look, upstairs.

694
00:32:57,933 --> 00:32:58,933
Let's go.

695
00:33:00,252 --> 00:33:01,732
You're all here.

696
00:33:03,133 --> 00:33:04,133
You're back.

697
00:33:04,812 --> 00:33:05,534
Who is this?

698
00:33:05,614 --> 00:33:07,812
This is my dear grandson,

699
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:09,732
Qian Xiaomi.

700
00:33:10,213 --> 00:33:11,012
Look.

701
00:33:11,173 --> 00:33:12,613
Doesn't he look like his dad?

702
00:33:12,933 --> 00:33:14,093
He's very well-behaved.

703
00:33:14,173 --> 00:33:15,853
Look, how cute!

704
00:33:15,933 --> 00:33:16,732
Right?

705
00:33:16,853 --> 00:33:18,333
Come on, Xiaomi.

706
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:21,492
Say hi to them.

707
00:33:21,893 --> 00:33:23,972
Hello.

708
00:33:25,052 --> 00:33:27,093
He looks really energetic.

709
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:28,653
Is he cute?

710
00:33:28,733 --> 00:33:30,572
Cute, really cute.

711
00:33:33,532 --> 00:33:34,732
Dami?

712
00:33:35,133 --> 00:33:36,133
It's been a while.

713
00:33:36,213 --> 00:33:37,652
She is such a big girl now.

714
00:33:37,732 --> 00:33:39,293
Yes, I couldn't even recognize her.

715
00:33:39,373 --> 00:33:40,572
She's grown so tall.

716
00:33:40,693 --> 00:33:41,574
Hello.

717
00:33:41,654 --> 00:33:42,893
Hello.

718
00:33:43,332 --> 00:33:44,572
So well-behaved.

719
00:33:45,772 --> 00:33:46,772
Give me a kiss.

720
00:33:47,292 --> 00:33:48,292
One more.

721
00:33:49,332 --> 00:33:50,732
One more.

722
00:33:53,492 --> 00:33:54,452
One more.

723
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,133
One more.

724
00:33:58,812 --> 00:33:59,892
Let me tell you.

725
00:33:59,972 --> 00:34:01,172
In the next half year,

726
00:34:01,252 --> 00:34:02,212
my daughter-in-law

727
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:03,172
is having a baby.

728
00:34:03,252 --> 00:34:04,492
Mom, mom.

729
00:34:04,732 --> 00:34:05,853
I'll take Dami up.

730
00:34:05,933 --> 00:34:07,732
Okay, I'll come up in a while.

731
00:34:09,053 --> 00:34:10,053
Look at us,

732
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:11,693
thriving with people.

733
00:34:12,053 --> 00:34:13,973
Sit down.

734
00:34:14,133 --> 00:34:15,212
- Sit down.
- Sit down.

735
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:16,372
- Look.
- This child is...

736
00:34:16,452 --> 00:34:17,014
Pretty, right?

737
00:34:17,094 --> 00:34:18,133
Yes.

738
00:34:18,613 --> 00:34:21,533
He's my dear grandson.

739
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:23,412
So cute.

740
00:34:31,292 --> 00:34:33,252
Dad, I want a hug.

741
00:34:33,332 --> 00:34:34,932
Can you give me a hug?

742
00:34:36,533 --> 00:34:37,533
What's wrong?

743
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:39,173
Do you feel

744
00:34:39,253 --> 00:34:40,772
grandma has wronged you?

745
00:34:40,852 --> 00:34:42,453
She never likes me.

746
00:34:42,533 --> 00:34:43,693
She likes Xiaomi.

747
00:34:47,533 --> 00:34:48,533
Dami.

748
00:34:52,013 --> 00:34:53,372
You have grown so tall.

749
00:34:54,812 --> 00:34:56,533
I know you don't like grandma.

750
00:34:58,292 --> 00:34:59,093
She indeed has done

751
00:34:59,173 --> 00:35:00,173
many wrong things.

752
00:35:00,812 --> 00:35:01,533
But she is

753
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:02,613
my mother.

754
00:35:03,252 --> 00:35:04,412
And I love her very much.

755
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,212
Now she is sick,

756
00:35:06,292 --> 00:35:06,934
and cannot

757
00:35:07,014 --> 00:35:08,613
be with us for much longer.

758
00:35:09,412 --> 00:35:10,533
Just let her have fun

759
00:35:10,732 --> 00:35:11,892
and treat her as a child.

760
00:35:12,932 --> 00:35:14,892
I will make it up to you.

761
00:35:17,332 --> 00:35:18,973
Don't tell mom, okay?

762
00:35:24,053 --> 00:35:25,053
Okay?

763
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:26,573
Okay.

764
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:28,613
You are my dad, after all.

765
00:35:28,892 --> 00:35:30,133
I have to say yes.

766
00:35:34,213 --> 00:35:36,093
Alright, you are a big girl now.

767
00:35:36,292 --> 00:35:37,292
I can give you

768
00:35:37,533 --> 00:35:38,413
a piggyback ride.

769
00:35:38,493 --> 00:35:39,093
Come on.

770
00:35:39,173 --> 00:35:40,173
Come on.

771
00:35:41,732 --> 00:35:42,732
Let's go.

772
00:35:48,932 --> 00:35:49,932
You get in the car.

773
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:54,252
Is this your car?

774
00:35:55,493 --> 00:35:57,213
No, it's my girlfriend's.

775
00:35:57,332 --> 00:35:58,893
Her car has a little scratch.

776
00:35:58,973 --> 00:36:00,573
I was going to take it to fix.

777
00:36:02,053 --> 00:36:03,053
Alright.

778
00:36:03,332 --> 00:36:04,332
Sorry.

779
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,013
Give it to me, I'll do it.

780
00:36:11,932 --> 00:36:12,932
Give it to me.

781
00:36:13,412 --> 00:36:14,212
I'll drive.

782
00:36:14,292 --> 00:36:14,974
Sit in the back

783
00:36:15,054 --> 00:36:16,093
to talk with Mr. Lin.

784
00:36:17,573 --> 00:36:18,933
Alright, thank you.

785
00:36:19,013 --> 00:36:19,653
You're welcome.

786
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:21,292
I'll handle it.

787
00:36:31,412 --> 00:36:33,372
Is your phone out of battery?

788
00:37:03,892 --> 00:37:05,172
Mei Chengyi

789
00:37:05,252 --> 00:37:06,852
really has no sincerity at all.

790
00:37:06,932 --> 00:37:08,613
Three calls are not enough.

791
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:10,533
At least make five calls.

792
00:37:10,653 --> 00:37:11,772
Make two more calls.

793
00:37:11,852 --> 00:37:13,372
Make two more calls, and I'll pick up.

794
00:37:14,653 --> 00:37:15,892
You're really something else.

795
00:37:15,973 --> 00:37:17,372
Don't talk to me today.

796
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,992
(Project Cooperation, Planning Proposal)

797
00:37:43,932 --> 00:37:45,013
How much of it

798
00:37:45,772 --> 00:37:47,013
has been completed?

799
00:37:47,372 --> 00:37:47,974
Basically,

800
00:37:48,054 --> 00:37:49,692
60 percent is nailed down.

801
00:37:49,772 --> 00:37:50,333
The rest...

802
00:37:50,413 --> 00:37:51,372
I wanted to try to meet

803
00:37:51,452 --> 00:37:52,573
the KPI for the second half.

804
00:37:52,653 --> 00:37:53,173
So, I haven't

805
00:37:53,253 --> 00:37:54,372
signed the contract.

806
00:37:56,452 --> 00:37:57,413
Your company wants to

807
00:37:57,493 --> 00:37:58,932
trick me?

808
00:37:59,013 --> 00:38:00,413
No, how could that be?

809
00:38:00,493 --> 00:38:01,573
In this industry,

810
00:38:01,653 --> 00:38:02,613
my reputation is fine.

811
00:38:02,693 --> 00:38:03,932
I would never do this.

812
00:38:05,332 --> 00:38:07,252
But it's a nice deal,

813
00:38:07,693 --> 00:38:08,732
I can't figure it out.

814
00:38:09,812 --> 00:38:10,614
Right.

815
00:38:10,694 --> 00:38:12,013
I can't figure it out either.

816
00:38:12,372 --> 00:38:13,372
What about the KPI?

817
00:38:13,613 --> 00:38:15,332
Mr. Lin, don't joke.

818
00:38:15,412 --> 00:38:16,332
You've been wanting

819
00:38:16,412 --> 00:38:17,094
to poach

820
00:38:17,174 --> 00:38:18,252
Mei Chengyi.

821
00:38:18,332 --> 00:38:19,452
Don't you know him?

822
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:20,533
He has the best

823
00:38:20,613 --> 00:38:21,613
performance.

824
00:38:22,372 --> 00:38:23,973
I want to poach him.

825
00:38:24,133 --> 00:38:25,573
Otherwise, with such tight timing,

826
00:38:25,812 --> 00:38:26,973
why would I meet him?

827
00:38:28,252 --> 00:38:29,852
But it is a different story.

828
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,452
He approaches me,

829
00:38:31,573 --> 00:38:33,412
and I wonder why.

830
00:38:33,932 --> 00:38:35,613
I heard your company

831
00:38:35,693 --> 00:38:36,933
has an AI media project

832
00:38:37,013 --> 00:38:38,013
and it failed,

833
00:38:38,292 --> 00:38:39,613
is short on money.

834
00:38:40,613 --> 00:38:41,692
But they don't need

835
00:38:41,772 --> 00:38:43,213
to do such a cruel thing.

836
00:38:43,452 --> 00:38:44,312
By the way, Mr. Lin,

837
00:38:44,312 --> 00:38:45,533
during the social engagement,

838
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:47,053
I heard a gossip.

839
00:38:47,213 --> 00:38:48,652
It seems that his boss's son

840
00:38:48,732 --> 00:38:50,332
has returned from studying abroad,

841
00:38:50,732 --> 00:38:51,613
thinking the company

842
00:38:51,693 --> 00:38:52,693
has redundant personnel.

843
00:38:52,812 --> 00:38:53,812
The boss

844
00:38:53,892 --> 00:38:54,533
might as well

845
00:38:54,613 --> 00:38:55,494
let his son

846
00:38:55,574 --> 00:38:57,093
handle the layoffs.

847
00:38:57,332 --> 00:38:58,653
So now,

848
00:38:58,812 --> 00:39:00,453
the middle management over 35 years old

849
00:39:00,533 --> 00:39:01,852
is the main target for layoffs.

850
00:39:03,812 --> 00:39:05,732
Well, I have to thank his son

851
00:39:05,852 --> 00:39:07,892
for letting me hire you.

852
00:39:10,252 --> 00:39:11,732
Chengyi, what are your demands?

853
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:14,013
If it's just a simple job-hopping,

854
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:15,253
you wouldn't

855
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,573
do this, right?

856
00:39:17,613 --> 00:39:18,534
I want

857
00:39:18,614 --> 00:39:19,692
30 percent more

858
00:39:19,772 --> 00:39:20,772
on my current salary,

859
00:39:21,013 --> 00:39:21,653
and I will

860
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:22,852
bring two people over.

861
00:39:25,013 --> 00:39:26,452
I can let you bring two people,

862
00:39:27,013 --> 00:39:28,013
but

863
00:39:28,412 --> 00:39:29,812
the 30 percent salary increase

864
00:39:29,892 --> 00:39:31,212
must be deducted

865
00:39:31,292 --> 00:39:32,292
from their salaries.

866
00:39:32,452 --> 00:39:35,053
You'd get a raise,

867
00:39:35,252 --> 00:39:37,213
and your team members get a pay cut.

868
00:39:37,573 --> 00:39:38,652
Moreover, if you fail

869
00:39:38,732 --> 00:39:39,812
to meet the performance

870
00:39:39,892 --> 00:39:41,213
you promise,

871
00:39:42,973 --> 00:39:44,452
you will get penalized.

872
00:39:46,613 --> 00:39:47,613
Mei Chengyi.

873
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:49,613
I know you're nice.

874
00:39:50,213 --> 00:39:51,292
And I'm not the only one

875
00:39:51,372 --> 00:39:52,372
who's interested in you.

876
00:39:52,732 --> 00:39:53,732
You might find it strange

877
00:39:54,053 --> 00:39:54,933
why I don't agree

878
00:39:55,013 --> 00:39:56,013
to your demands,

879
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:57,093
but try to suppress you.

880
00:39:58,053 --> 00:39:59,613
For many years,

881
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,173
I've seen quite a few talents.

882
00:40:01,372 --> 00:40:02,852
I poached them with high salaries.

883
00:40:03,053 --> 00:40:04,053
But after a year,

884
00:40:04,213 --> 00:40:05,493
they earned a lot of money,

885
00:40:05,772 --> 00:40:06,852
but didn't do the job well

886
00:40:07,013 --> 00:40:08,252
and left.

887
00:40:09,613 --> 00:40:11,212
They gained some experience with me

888
00:40:11,292 --> 00:40:12,213
and went somewhere else

889
00:40:12,293 --> 00:40:13,892
to get a higher salary.

890
00:40:17,133 --> 00:40:18,533
I can pay your high salary.

891
00:40:19,133 --> 00:40:20,452
Anyway, it's just a cake.

892
00:40:20,772 --> 00:40:21,772
If you want more,

893
00:40:22,173 --> 00:40:23,693
then they will get less.

894
00:40:43,533 --> 00:40:44,772
Put your hands on your waist.

895
00:40:45,013 --> 00:40:46,852
Then we swing our heads.

896
00:40:46,932 --> 00:40:48,693
Look, the body faces forward.

897
00:40:49,573 --> 00:40:50,372
Look.

898
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,573
Turn.

899
00:40:52,852 --> 00:40:53,892
Very good.

900
00:40:54,613 --> 00:40:56,892
Then swing your heads.

901
00:40:57,133 --> 00:40:58,133
This way.

902
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:01,973
Keep your head still, then turn.

903
00:41:03,693 --> 00:41:05,973
Right, that's a circle now.

904
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,172
Do it again.

905
00:41:07,252 --> 00:41:08,372
Put your hands on the waist.

906
00:41:09,053 --> 00:41:09,773
Do it.

907
00:41:09,853 --> 00:41:11,133
Put your hands on your waist.

908
00:41:11,372 --> 00:41:13,212
Then we swing our heads.

909
00:41:13,292 --> 00:41:15,013
Look, the body faces forward.

910
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:16,973
Look.

911
00:41:17,452 --> 00:41:18,452
Turn.

912
00:41:19,613 --> 00:41:20,613
Very good.

913
00:41:21,372 --> 00:41:22,693
Then head...

914
00:42:03,093 --> 00:42:04,093
Alright.

915
00:42:04,732 --> 00:42:06,892
He isn't answering my call.

916
00:42:19,812 --> 00:42:21,013
Alright, class is over.

917
00:42:21,093 --> 00:42:22,093
Thank you.

918
00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:25,133
Thank you.

919
00:42:25,372 --> 00:42:26,812
Goodbye.

920
00:42:27,292 --> 00:42:28,732
Go change clothes. Goodbye.

921
00:42:28,892 --> 00:42:29,693
Goodbye.

922
00:42:29,892 --> 00:42:30,892
Yu'an, Yule.

923
00:42:32,053 --> 00:42:33,372
- Come here.
- Mom.

924
00:42:38,332 --> 00:42:39,013
Hello, Miss.

925
00:42:39,093 --> 00:42:40,053
Hello.

926
00:42:40,133 --> 00:42:42,013
Yu'an and Yule's dad

927
00:42:42,093 --> 00:42:42,813
asks me

928
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,053
to pick up the kids.

929
00:42:44,133 --> 00:42:44,974
Did he tell you?

930
00:42:45,054 --> 00:42:46,372
Yes, he told me.

931
00:42:47,093 --> 00:42:47,853
Yu'an, Yule,

932
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:49,613
your dad has something to do today.

933
00:42:49,693 --> 00:42:50,213
So,

934
00:42:50,293 --> 00:42:51,413
go with her please.

935
00:42:51,493 --> 00:42:52,493
Is it okay?

936
00:42:52,613 --> 00:42:53,372
No.

937
00:42:53,452 --> 00:42:54,973
She wants to be our stepmom.

938
00:42:55,133 --> 00:42:56,412
I don't want to go with her.

939
00:42:58,732 --> 00:43:00,692
I'm just, on behalf of your dad,

940
00:43:00,772 --> 00:43:02,812
sending you back
to your grandparents' house.

941
00:43:02,892 --> 00:43:03,613
No.

942
00:43:03,693 --> 00:43:04,693
No.
