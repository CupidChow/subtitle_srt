16
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:39,900
The company is dissatisfied with you.

17
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,021
But if you handled things perfectly,

18
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,301
you'll have a turning point.

19
00:01:43,661 --> 00:01:44,861
If we proceed in your way,

20
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:47,101
I'm not satisfied with the outcome.

21
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,581
So, this time,

22
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:50,060
let's proceed in my way.

23
00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:53,661
Sorry.

24
00:01:54,501 --> 00:01:56,540
I'm just giving you
some friendly advice.

25
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:57,661
To be honest,

26
00:01:58,781 --> 00:02:00,581
I don't like advice.

27
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,301
Master, don't worry.

28
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,180
Every single member of my team and I

29
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,260
won't resign.

30
00:02:05,381 --> 00:02:07,581
After all, the layoff compensation
is more attractive.

31
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:08,661
Don't you think so?

32
00:02:09,341 --> 00:02:10,941
Alright. If there's nothing else,

33
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:12,421
I'll get back to work

34
00:02:12,501 --> 00:02:13,501
diligently.

35
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:16,101
Mei Chengyi, I haven't finished.

36
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:17,501
Mei Chengyi.

37
00:02:20,941 --> 00:02:22,300
You!

38
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,420
I'm furious.

39
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:37,661
Is this the end?

40
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:57,260
Where is this bus going?

41
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:18,101
This one.

42
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:26,260
(Jiang City, Yongshou Cemetery)
Hurry up.

43
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,580
(A Second Chance)
Xiao, good morning.

44
00:03:55,901 --> 00:03:56,901
Morning.

45
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,340
Would you like some?

46
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,780
No need. I don't need it.

47
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,180
I-I've already eaten.

48
00:04:19,901 --> 00:04:20,901
You go ahead.

49
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,940
Alright.

50
00:04:28,661 --> 00:04:29,661
Wang Ke.

51
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,100
Nothing annoying,

52
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,180
right?

53
00:04:33,101 --> 00:04:34,061
No.

54
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:35,380
Everything is good.

55
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,420
What's wrong?

56
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:39,221
Nothing.

57
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:40,500
You go ahead.

58
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,781
It's quite nice.

59
00:05:20,701 --> 00:05:22,500
Where is she going?

60
00:05:23,021 --> 00:05:24,461
After so long time,

61
00:05:25,461 --> 00:05:27,341
she has not gotten off the bus.

62
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,060
Is she going to meet someone?

63
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,540
Who is she going to meet?
Going this far?

64
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,461
Who cares?

65
00:05:36,821 --> 00:05:37,821
Keep following,

66
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:39,380
and we'll know then.

67
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,581
This apartment is good.

68
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,581
But we have to

69
00:05:56,021 --> 00:05:58,221
move again.

70
00:05:59,581 --> 00:06:01,420
Why not pool money and buy one?

71
00:06:02,101 --> 00:06:03,261
Pay the down payment first.

72
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,661
If you're worried about the loan,

73
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,380
I have pension.

74
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,100
If I break up with Mei Chengyi,

75
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:12,620
it'd be awkward living across the hall.

76
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,501
You had divorced once.

77
00:06:15,581 --> 00:06:17,304
What now?
You decide never to marry again?

78
00:06:18,221 --> 00:06:18,901
Oh my.

79
00:06:18,981 --> 00:06:20,420
A contract?

80
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,741
You're really ridiculous.

81
00:06:21,821 --> 00:06:23,141
Just go ahead.

82
00:06:23,781 --> 00:06:25,540
It's not like I've never been married.

83
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,821
I've been through it.

84
00:06:28,261 --> 00:06:29,180
The marriage

85
00:06:29,261 --> 00:06:31,021
is a security for women.

86
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,340
In my opinion,

87
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,182
our own brains

88
00:06:34,262 --> 00:06:35,620
is a security for women.

89
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,300
Even marriage laws

90
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,420
couldn't protect me
if I'm being foolish.

91
00:06:41,581 --> 00:06:42,581
How about this?

92
00:06:42,781 --> 00:06:43,701
I'll go to Li Xiaoxiao

93
00:06:43,781 --> 00:06:44,781
and register for you.

94
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,340
You find a reliable old man

95
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,660
and get a security.

96
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:48,941
You girl!

97
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:50,061
At my age,

98
00:06:50,141 --> 00:06:51,380
I don't need a man anymore.

99
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,341
With my pension,

100
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:53,420
I'll act as his nanny?

101
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,980
You!

102
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:55,861
See?

103
00:06:55,941 --> 00:06:57,180
I'm following suit.

104
00:06:57,461 --> 00:06:58,141
You don't

105
00:06:58,221 --> 00:06:58,702
get married.

106
00:06:58,782 --> 00:07:00,261
Why force me to?

107
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:03,581
Mei Chengyi is really

108
00:07:03,781 --> 00:07:05,420
a nice guy.

109
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,100
We just talked about
finding an apartment,

110
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,180
and now,

111
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,180
he's cleaned up the house.

112
00:07:12,221 --> 00:07:13,461
But our lease agreement

113
00:07:14,021 --> 00:07:15,540
still has half a month left.

114
00:07:15,901 --> 00:07:17,180
It'd be a loss of money.

115
00:07:17,781 --> 00:07:18,860
The school of Dami

116
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,461
is not far from here.

117
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,940
But Xiaomi's kindergarten

118
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:24,341
is not nearby.

119
00:07:25,461 --> 00:07:27,180
Change Xiaomi's kindergarten.

120
00:07:28,141 --> 00:07:30,060
Perfect, we can keep Qian Hao away.

121
00:08:08,701 --> 00:08:10,701
This is the cemetery
that You Xin is buried.

122
00:08:11,221 --> 00:08:12,781
Why is Youyou here?

123
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:14,461
She doesn't go to work,

124
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,701
but to see her sister?

125
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,182
She doesn't know

126
00:08:17,262 --> 00:08:18,740
her sister's cemetery is here.

127
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,221
She has never been here.

128
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,261
Maybe Chengyi told her.

129
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,821
Stop guessing.

130
00:08:25,021 --> 00:08:26,620
We'll know then.

131
00:08:35,352 --> 00:08:39,640
(Yongshou Cemetery)

132
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,941
Why are you here?

133
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:51,221
Complaining to me won't help.

134
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,620
Hurry up.

135
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,260
Here she is.

136
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,501
Complaining to me won't help.

137
00:09:04,581 --> 00:09:05,741
Master always gives customers

138
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:06,780
a personal concert

139
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,740
with just one song.

140
00:09:09,701 --> 00:09:11,381
Perhaps one day,
someone with a bad temper

141
00:09:11,461 --> 00:09:13,260
might come up from the grave to hit him.

142
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,500
Let's go.

143
00:09:21,341 --> 00:09:22,341
Let's go.

144
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,860
Xin,

145
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:52,461
be happy today.

146
00:09:53,221 --> 00:09:54,541
Chengyi criticized me.

147
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:55,781
Later,

148
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:56,820
I'll have someone

149
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,861
to repaint the words

150
00:09:57,941 --> 00:09:59,341
on your tombstone.

151
00:10:00,221 --> 00:10:01,541
Now, I

152
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,260
(You Xin)
am a manager now.

153
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
She doesn't go to work,

154
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:29,020
but comes to visit her sister's grave.

155
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,421
She still hasn't let go.

156
00:10:33,821 --> 00:10:34,860
Who can let go?

157
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:37,020
Can we?

158
00:10:39,701 --> 00:10:41,060
We are not short of money,

159
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,020
not to mention her salary.

160
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,421
She can take a leave.

161
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,620
Just let the company dock her pay.

162
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,660
Let's go back.

163
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:52,301
For what?

164
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,660
We have to wait here.

165
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:57,501
She might go to work

166
00:10:57,581 --> 00:10:59,061
after this.

167
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,461
Don't let her notice us.

168
00:11:16,181 --> 00:11:17,421
I'm going to work.

169
00:11:17,581 --> 00:11:18,701
I'll come see you tomorrow.

170
00:11:22,301 --> 00:11:23,421
She's leaving.

171
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,860
Come on.

172
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:56,461
Dad.

173
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:01,860
(Ten teaching characteristics)
Is Grandma okay?

174
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,221
Hello.

175
00:12:03,341 --> 00:12:04,341
Hello.

176
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:05,660
I am his dad.

177
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:07,221
His grandma is sick,

178
00:12:07,301 --> 00:12:08,501
so I have to take him back.

179
00:12:08,581 --> 00:12:09,421
Please wait a moment.

180
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:11,021
I'll contact Xiaomi's mom.

181
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:11,581
No need.

182
00:12:11,661 --> 00:12:12,700
I am his dad.

183
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,021
I have the right to take him.

184
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:14,700
Wait.

185
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,222
His mom

186
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,420
has informed us.

187
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,140
She's the only one to pick up the child.

188
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:18,660
I must

189
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:19,540
tell her everything.

190
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,540
No need.

191
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,022
Sir,

192
00:12:21,102 --> 00:12:22,500
you can't just take him away.

193
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,301
Sir,

194
00:12:23,381 --> 00:12:24,341
please put him down.

195
00:12:24,421 --> 00:12:25,539
I need to call her.

196
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:25,861
Okay?

197
00:12:25,941 --> 00:12:26,941
Sir.

198
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,500
Security!

199
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:31,341
Security!

200
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:34,581
Security!

201
00:12:35,061 --> 00:12:36,061
Security!

202
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,660
Stop the car.

203
00:12:45,421 --> 00:12:46,621
Open it.

204
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:47,860
Child.

205
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,980
Sir.

206
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,421
Now,

207
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:55,900
why don't you pick up the call?

208
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,020
Master.

209
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,740
I'm back.

210
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,860
Welcome back.

211
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:32,541
Let's go?

212
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:33,540
Let's go.

213
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,620
Let's go.

214
00:13:41,941 --> 00:13:42,941
Grandpa.

215
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,860
Xiaomi.

216
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,140
Didn't he go to kindergarten?

217
00:13:49,421 --> 00:13:50,701
My mom is like this.

218
00:13:50,941 --> 00:13:52,021
He is my son,

219
00:13:52,101 --> 00:13:53,421
so he must stay here.

220
00:13:54,221 --> 00:13:55,580
Does Xu Kaixin agree on it?

221
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,701
I don't care that much.

222
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,421
You are hiding it from her?

223
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,941
You're really looking for trouble.

224
00:14:04,101 --> 00:14:04,781
He's a child.

225
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:06,101
What's the point?

226
00:14:06,181 --> 00:14:07,660
You hide it

227
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:08,541
from her.

228
00:14:08,621 --> 00:14:10,141
Aren't you intensifying the conflict?

229
00:14:10,221 --> 00:14:11,221
So what?

230
00:14:11,301 --> 00:14:13,061
She had been my wife for a few years.

231
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,101
My mom was her mother-in-law, right?

232
00:14:15,181 --> 00:14:16,420
I didn't ask her

233
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
to stay here.

234
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,061
My mom loves Xiaomi.

235
00:14:21,421 --> 00:14:22,421
If he's staying here,

236
00:14:22,701 --> 00:14:24,101
maybe my mom can wake up earlier.

237
00:14:25,821 --> 00:14:28,101
Dad, I'm hungry.
I want to eat something.

238
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,660
Dad, give him some bread.

239
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,740
Yes.

240
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:35,381
Eat some bread.

241
00:14:35,461 --> 00:14:36,461
No.

242
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,860
I want to eat noodles.

243
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,140
I'll buy you some later, okay?

244
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,541
But I want to eat now.

245
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,981
Eat bread now.

246
00:14:44,061 --> 00:14:45,221
No way.

247
00:14:45,581 --> 00:14:46,621
I need to go back.

248
00:14:46,701 --> 00:14:48,900
I want to find Miss. Find my mom.

249
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:49,660
You!

250
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,461
What's wrong?

251
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:51,420
Where are you going?

252
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,060
No. I don't want to be here.

253
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:53,621
Come on.

254
00:14:53,701 --> 00:14:54,421
Why hit him?

255
00:14:54,501 --> 00:14:55,501
Why?

256
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:56,621
Alright, don't cry.

257
00:14:56,701 --> 00:14:58,061
He knows nothing.

258
00:14:58,301 --> 00:14:59,660
I hate Dad.

259
00:14:59,821 --> 00:15:00,660
Alright.

260
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,821
I'll go buy it.

261
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,900
I told you.

262
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,622
You insist

263
00:15:04,702 --> 00:15:06,101
on taking him from his mom.

264
00:15:06,341 --> 00:15:07,421
You can't take care of him.

265
00:15:07,421 --> 00:15:09,021
Why vent your anger at him?

266
00:15:09,101 --> 00:15:10,060
Oh, my!

267
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:11,541
Okay, I will buy it for you.

268
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,221
Oh, my!

269
00:15:14,341 --> 00:15:15,740
Come on, don't cry.

270
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,860
Come back soon!

271
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:28,222
I think...

272
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,381
Stop it. Do your work.

273
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:31,101
We should stock up

274
00:15:31,341 --> 00:15:31,982
more

275
00:15:32,062 --> 00:15:34,101
small ceramic figurines
of boys and girls,

276
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,500
small wreaths,

277
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,580
and gold ingots.

278
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:37,142
Right.

279
00:15:37,222 --> 00:15:38,420
And small incense burners.

280
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,500
Those sell the best.

281
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,341
I am so worried.

282
00:15:41,421 --> 00:15:42,342
When

283
00:15:42,422 --> 00:15:43,420
those festivals coming,

284
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,981
my rhinitis flare up.

285
00:15:45,061 --> 00:15:45,781
Yiersan

286
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,660
even gets gastroenteritis.

287
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,101
Civilized rituals.

288
00:15:50,541 --> 00:15:52,061
I think we need to offer some flowers.

289
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,500
Like those small flowers
you gave your sister.

290
00:15:54,581 --> 00:15:55,941
I think they are quite good.

291
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,021
If it were me,

292
00:15:58,101 --> 00:16:00,221
I would place the Calabash Brothers.

293
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:02,021
It's lively and festive.

294
00:16:02,101 --> 00:16:02,820
Think about it.

295
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,780
A circle of bodyguards
around my tombstone,

296
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,221
how impressive.

297
00:16:06,461 --> 00:16:07,180
Chinese people

298
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:08,022
have our own

299
00:16:08,102 --> 00:16:09,260
Chinese heroes.

300
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,220
Pick up all these dead leaves.

301
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:11,660
Come up.

302
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,461
Be careful.

303
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:13,262
Watch your step.

304
00:16:13,342 --> 00:16:14,461
Don't step on it.

305
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,061
It's so late.

306
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,981
Why is she doing here?

307
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,061
Isn't she going to work?

308
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,701
What?

309
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,421
Haven't you figured it out yet?

310
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,342
Our daughter

311
00:16:25,422 --> 00:16:26,381
was tricked

312
00:16:26,461 --> 00:16:27,620
by this cemetery keeper.

313
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:28,821
What?

314
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,742
I think she met him

315
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:32,701
when she came to visit her sister.

316
00:16:35,301 --> 00:16:37,421
I've seen this guy before.

317
00:16:38,701 --> 00:16:39,701
Right.

318
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:42,541
When You Xin's buried here,

319
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,701
he was the one who guards the cemetery.

320
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,260
What?

321
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,660
Let me see.

322
00:16:49,941 --> 00:16:52,060
He is almost 40,

323
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,821
almost 20 years

324
00:16:52,901 --> 00:16:54,221
older than Youyou.

325
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:56,660
How dare he!

326
00:16:56,941 --> 00:16:58,221
Watch

327
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,860
how I deal with him.

328
00:17:00,821 --> 00:17:01,660
Honey!

329
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,341
What's in the hair? So dirty.

330
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:06,140
Who are you?

331
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:06,780
Mom.

332
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,381
Dad.

333
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:09,501
See how I deal with you.

334
00:17:09,581 --> 00:17:10,501
What are you doing?

335
00:17:10,581 --> 00:17:10,942
Mom.

336
00:17:11,022 --> 00:17:12,540
You're so shameless.

337
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,741
You are so old.

338
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:15,021
How dare you!

339
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:15,942
We will never

340
00:17:16,022 --> 00:17:17,100
agree.

341
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,901
You're like a hooligan.

342
00:17:18,981 --> 00:17:20,700
He's my supervisor.

343
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,140
What?

344
00:17:23,821 --> 00:17:24,900
He is

345
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,460
my boss.

346
00:17:26,821 --> 00:17:28,061
I work here.

347
00:17:30,981 --> 00:17:31,981
Wait.

348
00:17:32,341 --> 00:17:33,341
Mom.

349
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,860
Honey.

350
00:17:44,261 --> 00:17:45,261
Mei.

351
00:17:47,061 --> 00:17:48,061
Mei.

352
00:17:49,781 --> 00:17:51,261
Take a look at this proposal.

353
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:52,541
Leave it here.

354
00:18:02,021 --> 00:18:02,981
Guess what Mei

355
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:03,860
is watching.

356
00:18:04,021 --> 00:18:04,621
What?

357
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:05,860
He's playing games.

358
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,301
Playing games?

359
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,660
Let me tell you.

360
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,741
It's more than that.

361
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,741
He was wearing headphones this morning.

362
00:18:27,821 --> 00:18:29,100
I thought he was on the phone.

363
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,261
He dropped his headphones,

364
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:31,501
and I picked them up.

365
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,272
Turns out he was listening to crosstalk.

366
00:18:33,272 --> 00:18:34,750
- Listening to crosstalk?
- Crosstalk?

367
00:18:35,341 --> 00:18:35,861
Oh my.

368
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:37,220
He listens to crosstalk?

369
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,701
Mei completely

370
00:18:38,781 --> 00:18:39,741
slacks off.

371
00:18:39,821 --> 00:18:41,261
I've worked with him for years,

372
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,021
and never seen him like this.

373
00:18:43,341 --> 00:18:44,501
You haven't noticed, right?

374
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,420
Ms. Li's mood today

375
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,061
is worse than yesterday.

376
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,181
Bro.

377
00:18:50,181 --> 00:18:51,060
Where did you pop up?

378
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:51,860
Guess what?

379
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,300
What?

380
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,181
Spit it out.

381
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:54,701
I heard Mei took annual leave

382
00:18:54,781 --> 00:18:56,820
for 14 days.

383
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,501
14 days?

384
00:18:57,581 --> 00:18:58,101
That many?

385
00:18:58,181 --> 00:18:59,420
- In one time?
- He took 14 days off.

386
00:19:00,021 --> 00:19:01,021
Hello, Ms. Li.

387
00:19:02,301 --> 00:19:03,780
These flowers need to be watered.

388
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,820
Right.

389
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,900
Going to wither away.

390
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,220
Not good.

391
00:19:21,301 --> 00:19:22,301
How?

392
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:23,660
Jump the ball?

393
00:19:30,101 --> 00:19:31,101
Excuse me.

394
00:19:32,301 --> 00:19:33,300
Ms. Li, what's wrong?

395
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,101
Why in a bad mood?

396
00:19:34,181 --> 00:19:35,541
Let's play together.

397
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,380
Who approved Mei Chengyi's annual leave?

398
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,421
Why didn't I know?

399
00:19:40,501 --> 00:19:41,501
Just this thing?

400
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,140
Why are you so mad?

401
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,061
You startled me

402
00:19:45,141 --> 00:19:46,301
to death.

403
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,340
Mei Chengyi provided

404
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:51,940
a hospital certificate for an injury.

405
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,541
So,

406
00:19:52,621 --> 00:19:53,661
I have to

407
00:19:53,741 --> 00:19:54,741
approve his leave.

408
00:19:54,821 --> 00:19:55,901
I can't stop him

409
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:56,981
from seeing a doctor.

410
00:19:57,061 --> 00:19:57,901
If he sues me,

411
00:19:57,981 --> 00:19:58,981
I'll be doomed.

412
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,341
He took half a month's annual leave.

413
00:20:01,821 --> 00:20:02,820
What about

414
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,502
the debt

415
00:20:03,582 --> 00:20:05,101
and the contracts?

416
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,421
I wanted to persuade him

417
00:20:07,501 --> 00:20:08,901
to wrap up some

418
00:20:08,981 --> 00:20:09,981
before he gets laid off

419
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:11,060
next month.

420
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,700
Now, it's perfect. Once he leaves,

421
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,261
will you HR clean up

422
00:20:14,341 --> 00:20:15,541
the mess?

423
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,860
No, Ms. Li.

424
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,139
The mess

425
00:20:18,219 --> 00:20:18,621
you did

426
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:20,140
should be solved yourself.

427
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:22,940
What do you mean?

428
00:20:23,261 --> 00:20:24,261
Shifting the blame?

429
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,700
Look at you,

430
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,061
young and naive.

431
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,820
I wanted

432
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,821
to save you

433
00:20:32,901 --> 00:20:34,220
some dignity.

434
00:20:35,261 --> 00:20:36,022
But unfortunately,

435
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:37,420
you just don't want it.

436
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:39,540
This is the annual report

437
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,501
submitted by your department
to headquarters.

438
00:20:41,821 --> 00:20:43,261
Those contracts you just mentioned

439
00:20:43,341 --> 00:20:44,981
seem to be all under your name.

440
00:20:45,061 --> 00:20:45,780
Nothing to do

441
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,860
with Mei Chengyi.

442
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,261
Why you need him?

443
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:50,981
The headquarters wants to lay off.

444
00:20:51,061 --> 00:20:52,261
Could this have nothing to do

445
00:20:52,341 --> 00:20:53,620
with you taking all the credit?

446
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:56,220
I remembered.

447
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,300
Aren't you best

448
00:20:58,380 --> 00:21:00,061
at taking credit and shifting blame?

449
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,180
What?

450
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,380
Mental control failed?

451
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,460
Do you really think

452
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,021
everyone pampers you?

453
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,900
Done.

454
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,140
Wait, you...

455
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,100
That foolish Mei Chengyi

456
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,061
has become smart.

457
00:21:19,141 --> 00:21:20,660
Why are you mad at me?

458
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:24,541
Where's the ball?

459
00:21:26,061 --> 00:21:27,540
What a great situation.

460
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,900
You've messed it all up.

461
00:21:54,821 --> 00:21:55,340
Your key.

462
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,420
Thank you.

463
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,900
Hello.

464
00:22:08,061 --> 00:22:09,061
It's me.

465
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:10,780
It doesn't count.

466
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,860
I'll do it one more time.

467
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,180
Hello.

468
00:22:13,781 --> 00:22:14,860
Alright.

469
00:22:14,981 --> 00:22:15,981
Okay.

470
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,180
Where are you?

471
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,460
At home, just arrived.

472
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:23,100
I'm at the car dealership.

473
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:23,662
Your car

474
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:24,820
is ready.

475
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,220
I'll bring it to you now.

476
00:22:26,301 --> 00:22:27,700
Don't you work today?

477
00:22:27,981 --> 00:22:28,981
Wait.

478
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:31,101
Are you so afraid I'll lose my job?

479
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:33,341
Don't worry. I won't spend your money.

480
00:22:33,781 --> 00:22:35,181
I've taken two years off

481
00:22:35,261 --> 00:22:36,141
to readjust

482
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,940
my pace of work and life.

483
00:22:38,741 --> 00:22:39,820
I want

484
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,220
to spend some time
to think things through.

485
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:45,061
So, I'm available now.

486
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,380
Well...

487
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,541
Are you coming over now?

488
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,180
Okay.

489
00:22:51,261 --> 00:22:53,021
I can help you tidy up

490
00:22:53,101 --> 00:22:54,101
stuff for moving.

491
00:22:54,821 --> 00:22:55,821
How long?

492
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:57,300
20 minutes.

493
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,580
Okay, got it.

494
00:22:58,660 --> 00:22:59,660
Alright, see you then.

495
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:17,942
(Mei.)

496
00:23:18,022 --> 00:23:19,380
(Can you stop being mysterious?)

497
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,820
(What's going on?)

498
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:21,461
(Boss.)

499
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:22,422
(I've never seen you)

500
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:23,620
(take such a long leave.)

501
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,460
(Family matter?)

502
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,221
(Begging for a wake-up slap.)

503
00:23:26,301 --> 00:23:28,101
(I think Ms. Li is about to collapse.)

504
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,900
(The company wants)

505
00:23:30,101 --> 00:23:31,860
(to lay off our team.)

506
00:23:32,741 --> 00:23:33,741
(Not only that,)

507
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,140
(they don't want to pay us)

508
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,940
(the commission and bonus.)

509
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,620
(I can be fired.)

510
00:23:38,821 --> 00:23:40,101
(Layoff compensation is a must.)

511
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,101
(I can't waste my annual leave.)

512
00:23:42,101 --> 00:23:43,101
(What do you think?)

513
00:24:09,501 --> 00:24:10,620
Annoying.

514
00:24:43,101 --> 00:24:44,101
Mom.

515
00:24:45,781 --> 00:24:46,781
Honey.

516
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,741
How are you?

517
00:24:51,061 --> 00:24:52,220
Where is this?

518
00:24:52,501 --> 00:24:53,501
My dorm.

519
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,061
Are you okay?

520
00:24:58,261 --> 00:24:58,942
Don't rush.

521
00:24:59,022 --> 00:25:00,341
Don't rush to get up.

522
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,140
Come on.

523
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,901
Have some water.

524
00:25:05,981 --> 00:25:06,462
Support her.

525
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:07,821
Have some water, come on.

526
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,860
Have some water.

527
00:25:13,821 --> 00:25:14,821
Take it slow.

528
00:25:17,501 --> 00:25:18,501
Are you feeling better?

529
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:21,540
Go home.

530
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:22,221
What's wrong?

531
00:25:22,301 --> 00:25:23,140
Go home with me.

532
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:23,780
No, no.

533
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:24,300
Don't stay

534
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:24,941
here.

535
00:25:25,021 --> 00:25:25,701
Go home with me.

536
00:25:25,781 --> 00:25:26,100
Mom.

537
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:26,381
Go.

538
00:25:26,461 --> 00:25:27,540
Mom, I'm at work.

539
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,261
I'm not leaving.

540
00:25:28,341 --> 00:25:28,741
Calm down.

541
00:25:28,741 --> 00:25:29,501
Work?

542
00:25:29,741 --> 00:25:31,540
Is this where you work?

543
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,140
Don't stay

544
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:32,860
here.

545
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:33,860
Leave with me.

546
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,580
Mom.

547
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,660
Why can't I stay?

548
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:36,141
I work.

549
00:25:36,221 --> 00:25:37,261
Why can't I stay?

550
00:25:37,341 --> 00:25:38,021
Let go of me.

551
00:25:38,101 --> 00:25:39,100
You're not embarrassing?

552
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:39,861
If not,

553
00:25:39,941 --> 00:25:41,140
why are you

554
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:42,421
hiding this from us?

555
00:25:42,501 --> 00:25:42,982
Listen.

556
00:25:43,062 --> 00:25:44,140
I can support you for life,

557
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,300
but you can't stay here.

558
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,261
Calm down.

559
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:46,942
Mom.

560
00:25:47,022 --> 00:25:48,460
Look at you.

561
00:25:49,101 --> 00:25:49,742
Sit down.

562
00:25:49,822 --> 00:25:51,301
What?

563
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,700
I'm furious.

564
00:25:52,781 --> 00:25:53,381
Alright.

565
00:25:53,461 --> 00:25:54,501
Don't be mad.

566
00:25:54,581 --> 00:25:55,581
Alright.

567
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,660
Youyou.

568
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,420
Come on.

569
00:25:59,501 --> 00:26:00,501
Listen to me.

570
00:26:01,741 --> 00:26:02,860
Look at you,

571
00:26:03,021 --> 00:26:03,701
made your mom

572
00:26:03,781 --> 00:26:04,662
so mad.

573
00:26:04,742 --> 00:26:06,140
I didn't mean to.

574
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,340
Why is it always my fault?

575
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,022
Okay.

576
00:26:08,102 --> 00:26:09,261
Let's not talk about this.

577
00:26:09,781 --> 00:26:11,021
Think about it.

578
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,820
We've worked so hard

579
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,741
to send you abroad to study,

580
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,742
hoping you would

581
00:26:15,822 --> 00:26:17,140
have a good career.

582
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:17,781
What now?

583
00:26:17,861 --> 00:26:19,460
I like this work.

584
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,620
What is this?

585
00:26:22,101 --> 00:26:22,702
How do we

586
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:23,860
explain it to others?

587
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,860
To whom? Explain to whom?

588
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,661
Dad, why are you also like this?

589
00:26:27,741 --> 00:26:28,262
Alright.

590
00:26:28,342 --> 00:26:29,821
Let's not argue about this now.

591
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,341
Don't forget

592
00:26:33,061 --> 00:26:34,660
your mom has high blood pressure.

593
00:26:49,301 --> 00:26:50,420
Let's go home.

594
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,220
Honey.

595
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,461
Come on, let's go back.

596
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:57,741
Hurry up. Let's go.

597
00:26:57,821 --> 00:26:59,660
Go back.

598
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:00,981
Take it slow.

599
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:01,820
Slowly.

600
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,900
Go back.

601
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,420
Take it slow.

602
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,660
Go ahead.

603
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:20,741
Say goodbye.

604
00:27:21,581 --> 00:27:22,821
Maybe in the future,

605
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,741
it will just be the two of us again,

606
00:27:24,821 --> 00:27:26,420
a lonely man and a lonely dog.

607
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:29,021
Go ahead.

608
00:28:23,061 --> 00:28:23,742
Dad,

609
00:28:23,822 --> 00:28:25,900
when will Mom come to pick me up?

610
00:28:26,061 --> 00:28:28,261
Can you not talk for five minutes?

611
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,140
For five minutes.

612
00:28:35,501 --> 00:28:37,501
Dad, I'm thirsty.

613
00:28:40,061 --> 00:28:42,140
Okay, I will buy it for you.

614
00:28:42,781 --> 00:28:43,781
Wait here.

615
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,660
Don't make noise.

616
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,060
Dad, I want to pee.

617
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,220
Aren't you thirsty?

618
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:54,662
Pee?

619
00:28:54,742 --> 00:28:55,860
What do you really want?

620
00:28:56,781 --> 00:28:58,660
I am about to pee my pants.

621
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,860
Are you done?

622
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,061
I need to poop.

623
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,380
Hurry up.

624
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,420
Hello.

625
00:29:33,741 --> 00:29:34,580
No, no.

626
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:35,660
I am at the hospital.

627
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:38,221
I am coming.

628
00:29:38,301 --> 00:29:39,301
Right away.

629
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:45,620
Dad, I finished pooping. Wipe my bum.

630
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,860
Dad.

631
00:29:51,101 --> 00:29:52,101
Dad.

632
00:30:11,741 --> 00:30:13,021
Doctor, my mom...

633
00:30:14,501 --> 00:30:15,700
Regained consciousness.

634
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,541
She

635
00:30:16,621 --> 00:30:17,860
has stabilized,

636
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:19,021
and is improving steadily.

637
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,180
I think

638
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,860
she can make it.

639
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:24,701
Thank you.

640
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:25,301
Not at all.

641
00:30:25,381 --> 00:30:26,379
Thank you.

642
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:26,661
Okay.

643
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:27,741
Thank you.

644
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:29,942
You've been

645
00:30:30,022 --> 00:30:31,301
staying here for two days.

646
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,021
You really care about your mom.

647
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:36,021
Go back.

648
00:30:36,101 --> 00:30:36,982
Taking care of her

649
00:30:37,062 --> 00:30:38,300
is a long-term battle.

650
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:39,181
If you wear out

651
00:30:39,261 --> 00:30:39,942
yourself,

652
00:30:40,022 --> 00:30:41,140
then it's bad.

653
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,220
Thank you.

654
00:30:45,021 --> 00:30:46,021
By the way,

655
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,381
last month,

656
00:30:47,461 --> 00:30:48,900
I attended a seminar.

657
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,421
There is a lab abroad

658
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:52,140
that provided a brand new

659
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,541
treatment drug and plan.

660
00:30:54,301 --> 00:30:54,942
If your mom

661
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:56,140
has commercial insurance,

662
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,220
you can try it.

663
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,541
Otherwise, an average family

664
00:30:59,781 --> 00:31:00,620
cannot afford

665
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,141
the costs.

666
00:31:01,221 --> 00:31:02,380
It's okay, doctor.

667
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,701
Money doesn't matter, okay?

668
00:31:03,781 --> 00:31:04,820
If there is a hope,

669
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,021
I am willing to try.

670
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,140
Okay.

671
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:07,942
Then I'll go ask

672
00:31:08,022 --> 00:31:09,140
the organizers

673
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,620
to see if they can contact them.

674
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:12,021
Thank you.

675
00:31:12,101 --> 00:31:12,941
Really, thank you.

676
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:13,780
It's okay.

677
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,461
Thank you.

678
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:15,541
Let's go.

679
00:31:18,581 --> 00:31:20,061
That young guy is really nice.

680
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,140
Someone as filial as him...

681
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:30,180
Where's Xiaomi?

682
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,220
What's wrong?

683
00:31:38,341 --> 00:31:39,700
Make way, make way!

684
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,222
He...

685
00:31:41,302 --> 00:31:42,460
What's up?

686
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,860
What's wrong?

687
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,101
Have you seen a child?

688
00:31:53,341 --> 00:31:54,341
No, no.

689
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,620
Qian Hao, did you find him?

690
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:02,701
What are you doing?

691
00:32:02,781 --> 00:32:03,860
Are you snatching my child?

692
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:04,940
You...

693
00:32:08,061 --> 00:32:09,061
What's wrong with you?

694
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:09,860
How can you put

695
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,541
a young child

696
00:32:10,621 --> 00:32:11,900
there alone?

697
00:32:11,981 --> 00:32:13,060
You can't take care of him.

698
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,944
Why did you bring him

699
00:32:13,944 --> 00:32:14,581
over?

700
00:32:14,661 --> 00:32:16,140
Shut up!

701
00:32:18,781 --> 00:32:19,860
Oh my.

702
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:32,620
Hello, sir.

703
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,220
Is this Mr. Mei's house?

704
00:33:35,501 --> 00:33:36,501
Mr. Mei.

705
00:33:38,741 --> 00:33:39,541
I am.

706
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,660
Your takeout.

707
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:41,860
Take it.

708
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:43,021
Goodbye.

709
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:06,180
(You guy.)

710
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:08,060
(With my flaming red lips,)

711
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:08,780
(I'll get you.)

712
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,280
Come in.

713
00:34:09,421 --> 00:34:10,580
(Today, I have to)

714
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:12,461
(make you bewitched!)

715
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:30,022
Well...

716
00:34:30,102 --> 00:34:31,341
I'll park the car

717
00:34:31,421 --> 00:34:32,421
in a parking spot.

718
00:34:32,501 --> 00:34:33,220
Those scratches

719
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,140
have been repaired.

720
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,220
Can't tell at all.

721
00:34:36,421 --> 00:34:37,421
Thank you.

722
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,300
Lili isn't home?

723
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:42,061
She went to substitute teach.

724
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:42,901
It takes hours

725
00:34:42,981 --> 00:34:43,981
before she can come back.

726
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,300
I see.

727
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,901
What?

728
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,941
You prepared in advance?

729
00:34:53,981 --> 00:34:54,941
Wait, you can order,

730
00:34:55,021 --> 00:34:55,981
but why used my name?

731
00:34:56,061 --> 00:34:57,300
It's for you.

732
00:34:57,861 --> 00:34:58,861
Doesn't matter.

733
00:34:59,421 --> 00:35:00,421
Let's go.

734
00:35:02,061 --> 00:35:03,260
Before signing the contract,

735
00:35:03,581 --> 00:35:04,221
we have

736
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:05,581
to do a check-up

737
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,700
to ensure our safety.

738
00:35:09,501 --> 00:35:10,501
Let's go.

739
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,660
Wait.

740
00:35:11,941 --> 00:35:13,219
Do you need to give Lili

741
00:35:13,299 --> 00:35:13,581
a call?

742
00:35:13,661 --> 00:35:15,061
I'm afraid she'll return halfway.

743
00:35:15,381 --> 00:35:16,302
No.

744
00:35:16,382 --> 00:35:17,620
I'm already like this, you...

745
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,781
You make a call.

746
00:35:18,861 --> 00:35:19,821
I'm worried.

747
00:35:19,901 --> 00:35:21,180
If she catches me again,

748
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,660
how will I face her?

749
00:35:28,981 --> 00:35:31,220
Lili, where are you?

750
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,421
Buy a fish when you return,

751
00:35:32,501 --> 00:35:33,581
so I can make soup.

752
00:35:39,101 --> 00:35:40,421
At the senior university.

753
00:35:40,501 --> 00:35:42,341
I won't be back before 4 PM.

754
00:35:42,421 --> 00:35:44,101
And I'll go pick up Xiaomi.

755
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,660
You'll go pick up Dami.

756
00:35:51,501 --> 00:35:52,660
Ignore it.

757
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,740
No, you better answer it.

758
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,180
What if Lili

759
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,300
changes her plans?

760
00:35:57,981 --> 00:35:58,981
Hello.

761
00:36:00,981 --> 00:36:01,981
What?

762
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,141
What's wrong?

763
00:36:05,221 --> 00:36:06,260
Qian Hao picked up Xiaomi.

764
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,820
And Xiaomi got lost at the hospital.

765
00:36:13,061 --> 00:36:14,780
Don't worry, we'll be there soon.

766
00:36:18,021 --> 00:36:19,021
How much longer?

767
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,820
Almost there.

768
00:36:35,461 --> 00:36:36,781
Hey, bring the bird's nest ice

769
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:37,901
over to me.

770
00:36:38,541 --> 00:36:40,381
It's really hot here.

771
00:36:40,461 --> 00:36:41,901
I'm almost having a heat stroke.

772
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,381
Feeling unwell.

773
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:47,780
Thank you.

774
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:48,981
Hey.

775
00:36:49,061 --> 00:36:49,541
Look.

776
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:50,901
My hands are peeling.

777
00:36:50,981 --> 00:36:52,660
Bring me my hand cream.

778
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,541
Your hand cream.

779
00:36:59,101 --> 00:37:00,101
Thank you.

780
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,620
Sweetie.

781
00:37:09,021 --> 00:37:09,661
I think

782
00:37:09,741 --> 00:37:11,180
you can't lie down all the time.

783
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,060
Well, you come sit here.

784
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,461
I'll go lie down.

785
00:37:15,541 --> 00:37:16,261
You've slept

786
00:37:16,341 --> 00:37:17,539
for over ten hours,

787
00:37:17,619 --> 00:37:17,982
okay?

788
00:37:18,062 --> 00:37:19,381
It is tiring.

789
00:37:20,021 --> 00:37:22,660
If you're tired, go back to the hotel.

790
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,981
Why lying on my bed?

791
00:37:25,581 --> 00:37:26,342
You lie down here,

792
00:37:26,422 --> 00:37:27,501
what's wrong with you?

793
00:37:27,941 --> 00:37:29,140
Let me tell you.

794
00:37:29,501 --> 00:37:30,461
The caregiver

795
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:32,421
is paid for me,

796
00:37:32,501 --> 00:37:33,901
not for you.

797
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,620
What?

798
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,382
For you,

799
00:37:37,462 --> 00:37:38,421
I've traveled a long way

800
00:37:38,501 --> 00:37:39,861
to get here.

801
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,581
For me?

802
00:37:41,861 --> 00:37:43,061
You drank the soup,

803
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,461
and ate the bird's nest ice.

804
00:37:44,541 --> 00:37:45,740
She helped me to the restroom.

805
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,820
What have you done?

806
00:37:47,421 --> 00:37:48,780
Accompany you.

807
00:37:48,861 --> 00:37:50,660
This is what you need most.

808
00:37:51,021 --> 00:37:52,660
I know

809
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,821
you need me the most now.

810
00:37:53,901 --> 00:37:54,901
Right?

811
00:37:56,061 --> 00:37:58,501
I don't want you to leave.

812
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,180
I love you so much.

813
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,101
You go back

814
00:38:01,181 --> 00:38:02,861
and take a good rest, alright?

815
00:38:02,941 --> 00:38:03,701
Come to take care

816
00:38:03,781 --> 00:38:05,260
of me after that.

817
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,580
I want to rest,

818
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,620
Mom.

819
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:10,260
Don't you need me?

820
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,581
Alright then.

821
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,461
I'll go to your uncle's house

822
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,261
and take a nap.

823
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:15,821
After I wake up,

824
00:38:15,901 --> 00:38:17,140
I'll come to see you.

825
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:18,462
You are rich.

826
00:38:18,542 --> 00:38:20,061
Can't you go to hotel?

827
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,180
Don't bother my uncle and aunt.

828
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,461
Can't I go stay at

829
00:38:23,541 --> 00:38:24,740
my brother's place?

830
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,820
Bye.

831
00:38:25,941 --> 00:38:27,061
Mom.

832
00:38:32,941 --> 00:38:34,340
Take care.

833
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:40,620
Miss,

834
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,700
was that lady your mom?

835
00:38:43,861 --> 00:38:44,580
Stepmom?

836
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,660
Biological mom.

837
00:38:46,461 --> 00:38:47,780
Can't tell.

838
00:38:49,021 --> 00:38:49,822
Miss,

839
00:38:49,902 --> 00:38:51,461
I'm not trying to cause trouble.

840
00:38:51,541 --> 00:38:52,660
I've never seen

841
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,540
such a mom.

842
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,261
I thought

843
00:38:54,341 --> 00:38:55,981
she's the one who's pregnant.

844
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:57,181
Well,

845
00:38:57,261 --> 00:38:58,381
mind your business.

846
00:38:59,101 --> 00:39:00,100
You!

847
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,861
I'm just being nice.

848
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:03,461
I said this for you.

849
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,620
I hired you to take care of me,

850
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,260
not to gossip my family's affairs.

851
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:08,740
Can't you be polite?

852
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:11,341
Pay the bill. I'm done.

853
00:39:11,421 --> 00:39:13,180
You are really troublesome.

854
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:14,981
I quit.

855
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,061
Give me money.

856
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,061
Xiaomi.

857
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:27,861
Xiaomi.

858
00:39:27,941 --> 00:39:28,941
Mom.

859
00:39:29,541 --> 00:39:30,780
(Fire station)
Why are you here?

860
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,861
Dad took me to pee,

861
00:39:32,941 --> 00:39:34,301
but I can't find him.

862
00:39:34,381 --> 00:39:35,740
I was hungry,

863
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,060
wanting to eat some noodles.

864
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,781
The nurse brought me here

865
00:39:38,861 --> 00:39:39,981
to eat noodles.

866
00:39:40,101 --> 00:39:41,700
I can watch Ultraman here.

867
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:44,982
Alright.

868
00:39:45,062 --> 00:39:46,501
The kid is fine. Let's go home.

869
00:39:47,421 --> 00:39:48,781
It's okay. Let's go.

870
00:39:48,861 --> 00:39:49,580
Let's go home.

871
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,660
Xiaomi!

872
00:39:52,861 --> 00:39:53,541
How dare you!

873
00:39:53,621 --> 00:39:54,941
I've been looking for you.

874
00:39:55,021 --> 00:39:56,100
I was so worried.

875
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,300
Why are you yelling?

876
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:58,301
You lost him.

877
00:39:58,381 --> 00:39:59,260
Now you're yelling?

878
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,021
Is it my fault?

879
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:00,902
I took him to pee,

880
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,060
and he ran away.

881
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:02,901
You can't take care

882
00:40:02,981 --> 00:40:03,422
of him.

883
00:40:03,502 --> 00:40:04,739
Why are you yelling?

884
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:05,100
Listen.

885
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:05,981
It's none of

886
00:40:06,061 --> 00:40:06,740
your business.

887
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,461
Move aside.

888
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:08,382
Come with me, Xiaomi.

889
00:40:08,462 --> 00:40:09,421
What are you doing?

890
00:40:09,501 --> 00:40:10,620
Wanting to get physical?

891
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,461
That's enough.

892
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:12,301
I'm here.

893
00:40:12,381 --> 00:40:12,781
What?

894
00:40:12,861 --> 00:40:13,620
She shouted at me.

895
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,501
Didn't you hear?

896
00:40:14,581 --> 00:40:15,501
I didn't hear it.

897
00:40:15,581 --> 00:40:16,581
She is my girlfriend.

898
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,220
You have dated not long,

899
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,700
and you're protecting her?

900
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:21,982
What else then?

901
00:40:22,062 --> 00:40:23,140
To protect you?

902
00:40:24,021 --> 00:40:24,862
Let me tell you.

903
00:40:24,942 --> 00:40:26,300
Qian Xiaomi.

904
00:40:26,581 --> 00:40:27,941
Let go of me.

905
00:40:31,381 --> 00:40:32,381
I'm warning you.

906
00:40:32,461 --> 00:40:33,302
Starting today,

907
00:40:33,382 --> 00:40:34,901
you can't see my kids anymore.

908
00:40:35,581 --> 00:40:36,780
They have the surname Qian.

909
00:40:37,021 --> 00:40:37,981
Their grandma is sick.

910
00:40:38,061 --> 00:40:39,660
Why can't they stay in the hospital?

911
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,140
When Dami was sick,

912
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,220
where were you

913
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,300
and this grandma?

914
00:40:43,736 --> 00:40:44,661
When Xiaomi was a baby,

915
00:40:44,661 --> 00:40:46,180
crying all night long,

916
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:46,862
Dami and I

917
00:40:46,942 --> 00:40:48,060
went to the hospital.

918
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,461
Where were you two?

919
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,700
You and the mistress

920
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,981
tried hard to steal

921
00:40:52,061 --> 00:40:53,620
the house of me and the kids,

922
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,861
had you ever thought
that their surname is Qian?

923
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,461
Let me tell you, Qian Hao.

924
00:40:57,541 --> 00:40:58,660
These two kids

925
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,941
were not born

926
00:41:00,021 --> 00:41:01,021
for your filial piety.

927
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,140
If anything happens

928
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,780
to Xiaomi and Dami,

929
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:08,981
I will make you pay with your life.

930
00:41:11,861 --> 00:41:12,861
Let's go.

931
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,620
Move aside.

932
00:41:39,981 --> 00:41:40,981
Hello, honey.

933
00:41:41,901 --> 00:41:42,700
Xia Chungeng.

934
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,861
Come home now!

935
00:41:43,941 --> 00:41:45,140
Now!

936
00:41:46,021 --> 00:41:47,180
What happened?

937
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:48,701
I have a meeting

938
00:41:48,781 --> 00:41:49,821
to host.

939
00:41:49,901 --> 00:41:50,580
Okay.

940
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:51,382
If you don't care

941
00:41:51,462 --> 00:41:53,060
about me and your sister fighting,

942
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:54,501
don't come back.

943
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:00,340
Turn around ahead.

944
00:42:00,461 --> 00:42:01,301
Go back to my house.

945
00:42:01,381 --> 00:42:02,181
Faster.

946
00:42:02,261 --> 00:42:03,501
Mr. Xia, the meeting...

947
00:42:03,861 --> 00:42:04,504
Take a leave.

948
00:42:04,504 --> 00:42:05,461
Okay.

949
00:42:05,541 --> 00:42:06,260
The meeting

950
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,340
is not important now.

951
00:42:14,438 --> 00:42:15,780
The progesterone levels are good.

952
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:17,941
The ultrasound
shows the embryo is stable.

953
00:42:18,941 --> 00:42:20,700
But you have uterine fibroids.

954
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,061
This needs special attention.

955
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,061
As the child gets bigger,

956
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,821
the fibroids will grow

957
00:42:25,901 --> 00:42:26,941
affected by hormones.

958
00:42:27,021 --> 00:42:28,941
It will be easier
to cause friction bleeding.

959
00:42:29,101 --> 00:42:30,101
So,

960
00:42:30,541 --> 00:42:31,342
after six months,

961
00:42:31,422 --> 00:42:32,861
it's recommended to have bed rest.

962
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,700
If you give birth,
go for a cesarean section

963
00:42:35,021 --> 00:42:36,581
and remove the fibroids.

964
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,101
Doctor, I want to be discharged.

965
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,180
Okay.

966
00:42:44,421 --> 00:42:45,941
I'll make you a discharge slip

967
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,501
and give you the doctor's advices.

968
00:42:47,581 --> 00:42:48,022
Okay.

969
00:42:48,102 --> 00:42:49,941
Let the family handle it.

970
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,101
Okay.
