What's the situation?

17
00:01:39,635 --> 00:01:40,956
Has Ms. Lin made any changes?

18
00:01:41,195 --> 00:01:42,555
Yes, of course there are changes.

19
00:01:43,555 --> 00:01:44,876
Don't mess with me.

20
00:01:44,956 --> 00:01:46,236
Every now and then,

21
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:47,395
Ms. Lin keeps pestering me

22
00:01:47,475 --> 00:01:48,596
asking if you're okay,

23
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:50,157
how things are going,

24
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:51,195
or if you'll back out.

25
00:01:51,275 --> 00:01:52,675
If it doesn't work,

26
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:53,915
we can loosen the conditions.

27
00:01:54,076 --> 00:01:55,236
Negotiation, right?

28
00:01:55,316 --> 00:01:56,077
If it won't do,

29
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,316
we can discuss it again.

30
00:01:57,635 --> 00:01:58,915
You really scared me.

31
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:00,876
Please pass this on for me,

32
00:02:01,076 --> 00:02:02,675
I'll try to handle it

33
00:02:02,755 --> 00:02:03,716
within half a month.

34
00:02:03,796 --> 00:02:04,517
What I want is

35
00:02:04,597 --> 00:02:06,035
not to throw away

36
00:02:06,115 --> 00:02:07,516
the bonus I should get.

37
00:02:07,915 --> 00:02:08,915
Conditions are the same.

38
00:02:09,156 --> 00:02:10,555
I, for one, can forgo a raise,

39
00:02:10,635 --> 00:02:11,916
but the team I'm leading,

40
00:02:11,996 --> 00:02:13,355
especially the key members,

41
00:02:13,596 --> 00:02:14,915
can't have a reduction.

42
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:16,716
You can set a threshold,

43
00:02:17,036 --> 00:02:17,637
right?

44
00:02:17,717 --> 00:02:19,115
For this annual bonus,

45
00:02:19,195 --> 00:02:20,516
if you want to earn more,

46
00:02:20,596 --> 00:02:21,916
then increase the reward ratio

47
00:02:21,996 --> 00:02:23,276
a bit for me.

48
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:24,716
That's not a problem.

49
00:02:24,836 --> 00:02:26,475
I promise you on Ms. Lin's behalf.

50
00:02:26,755 --> 00:02:27,517
Have you been

51
00:02:27,597 --> 00:02:29,116
busy out of your mind lately?

52
00:02:29,276 --> 00:02:29,957
Although

53
00:02:30,037 --> 00:02:32,596
there's a lot going on
and it's quite chaotic,

54
00:02:33,116 --> 00:02:34,955
it's still okay, it feels pretty good.

55
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:36,036
Listen.

56
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:36,995
You be careful.

57
00:02:37,075 --> 00:02:37,676
Your manager

58
00:02:37,756 --> 00:02:39,276
isn't an easy one to deal with.

59
00:02:39,635 --> 00:02:40,636
I heard she recently

60
00:02:40,716 --> 00:02:41,436
snapped.

61
00:02:41,516 --> 00:02:42,555
Running around everywhere,

62
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:43,795
uniting many people,

63
00:02:44,116 --> 00:02:45,876
just to steal your business secretly.

64
00:02:46,596 --> 00:02:47,915
Anyway, be extra careful.

65
00:02:48,755 --> 00:02:50,275
All right, I don't want this either.

66
00:02:50,355 --> 00:02:51,716
After all, she's my mentor.

67
00:02:51,836 --> 00:02:53,876
She has indeed sincerely helped me.

68
00:02:55,036 --> 00:02:56,076
Go ahead with your work.

69
00:02:56,156 --> 00:02:57,316
I still need to organize

70
00:02:57,396 --> 00:02:58,915
this plan.

71
00:02:59,036 --> 00:02:59,995
After my joining,

72
00:03:00,075 --> 00:03:00,995
I'd deliver results.

73
00:03:01,075 --> 00:03:02,556
- Bye bye.
- Bye.

74
00:03:13,475 --> 00:03:14,115
Hello, Ms. Li.

75
00:03:14,195 --> 00:03:15,195
Hello.

76
00:03:34,675 --> 00:03:35,197
You,

77
00:03:35,277 --> 00:03:37,036
don't lose your temper with me here.

78
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,316
Instruction comes from above.

79
00:03:38,556 --> 00:03:39,316
My uncle's idea.

80
00:03:39,396 --> 00:03:40,275
What can I do?

81
00:03:40,355 --> 00:03:41,036
Besides,

82
00:03:41,116 --> 00:03:41,917
this bonus itself

83
00:03:41,997 --> 00:03:42,995
and the compensation

84
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:44,355
are already hard to agree upon.

85
00:03:44,675 --> 00:03:45,875
Mei Chengyi isn't a fool.

86
00:03:45,955 --> 00:03:46,596
So, how could he

87
00:03:46,676 --> 00:03:48,115
sign the non-compete clause?

88
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:49,475
You're still too green,

89
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,595
too inexperienced.

90
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:52,195
You're asking too much, aren't you?

91
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:54,317
Now you guys
are the ones making trouble, right?

92
00:03:54,397 --> 00:03:55,715
I've tried hard to make amends.

93
00:03:55,795 --> 00:03:56,916
I've used

94
00:03:56,996 --> 00:03:57,797
all my connections

95
00:03:57,877 --> 00:03:59,355
to secure the subsequent orders.

96
00:03:59,515 --> 00:04:00,197
Let me tell you,

97
00:04:00,277 --> 00:04:02,116
within half a year,
as long as Mei Chengyi is

98
00:04:02,235 --> 00:04:03,476
restricted by the clause

99
00:04:03,556 --> 00:04:04,356
and does nothing,

100
00:04:04,436 --> 00:04:06,276
our orders won't disappear.

101
00:04:07,836 --> 00:04:08,517
You're increasing

102
00:04:08,597 --> 00:04:09,715
my workload.

103
00:04:09,795 --> 00:04:11,075
I need to submit a report.

104
00:04:11,475 --> 00:04:12,716
Of course, it would be in vain.

105
00:04:13,156 --> 00:04:14,435
The non-compete compensation

106
00:04:14,515 --> 00:04:15,476
is not a small amount.

107
00:04:15,556 --> 00:04:16,275
Not sure if Uncle

108
00:04:16,355 --> 00:04:17,355
will part with that.

109
00:04:18,315 --> 00:04:18,996
He won't part

110
00:04:19,076 --> 00:04:20,035
with this and that.

111
00:04:20,115 --> 00:04:20,716
So, why not

112
00:04:20,796 --> 00:04:21,875
fire me too?

113
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:27,197
What?

114
00:04:27,277 --> 00:04:28,716
Nothing.

115
00:04:29,795 --> 00:04:30,995
Seriously.

116
00:05:03,115 --> 00:05:04,115
Li Xiaoxiao.

117
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:05,915
Don't keep scaring me

118
00:05:05,995 --> 00:05:07,756
like this, okay?

119
00:05:10,115 --> 00:05:11,435
I'm napping well.

120
00:05:12,516 --> 00:05:13,197
What?

121
00:05:13,277 --> 00:05:15,196
I just pushed you a bit.

122
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,395
Not working this morning,

123
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:17,316
and coming here

124
00:05:17,396 --> 00:05:18,396
to disturb me.

125
00:05:21,636 --> 00:05:22,236
It's not

126
00:05:22,316 --> 00:05:23,836
whether you belong to me or not.

127
00:05:24,475 --> 00:05:26,355
It's that I no longer belong to you.

128
00:05:26,675 --> 00:05:27,517
Where did you go?

129
00:05:27,597 --> 00:05:28,795
How do you not belong to me?

130
00:05:29,756 --> 00:05:30,756
Kaixin.

131
00:05:31,115 --> 00:05:32,436
I had a momentary lapse.

132
00:05:32,516 --> 00:05:33,516
I

133
00:05:34,555 --> 00:05:35,555
got married.

134
00:05:37,756 --> 00:05:39,076
(Marriage Certificate)
He transferred all the money to me.

135
00:05:39,156 --> 00:05:40,596
He even noted 'voluntary gift.'

136
00:05:40,875 --> 00:05:42,036
The house is also notarized.

137
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:44,224
(Property Ownership Certificate)

138
00:05:45,355 --> 00:05:47,156
Don't laugh anymore.

139
00:05:47,795 --> 00:05:48,956
You just told me

140
00:05:49,036 --> 00:05:50,155
that middle-aged women

141
00:05:50,235 --> 00:05:51,556
shouldn't be led by love.

142
00:05:51,636 --> 00:05:53,116
But then I impulsively

143
00:05:53,196 --> 00:05:54,636
made a love-related mistake.

144
00:05:55,276 --> 00:05:56,675
Kaixin, go ahead and scold me.

145
00:05:57,276 --> 00:05:58,956
Why should I scold you?

146
00:05:59,315 --> 00:06:00,315
I told you

147
00:06:00,516 --> 00:06:02,076
that you shouldn't be led.

148
00:06:02,156 --> 00:06:02,757
But I didn't

149
00:06:02,837 --> 00:06:04,795
say that Song Ran couldn't be led.

150
00:06:05,795 --> 00:06:08,355
(Property Ownership Certificate)
Now he has fallen in love.

151
00:06:09,315 --> 00:06:11,636
Now he cannot extricate himself.

152
00:06:12,315 --> 00:06:14,756
Now you've become a rich woman.

153
00:06:15,836 --> 00:06:16,836
Rich woman.

154
00:06:17,396 --> 00:06:18,795
How about supporting me?

155
00:06:19,636 --> 00:06:20,836
Xu Kaixin.

156
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:31,115
Hello.

157
00:06:32,276 --> 00:06:32,836
Hello.

158
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,035
I am...

159
00:06:34,115 --> 00:06:35,435
I know.

160
00:06:35,516 --> 00:06:37,155
It's just that our two families

161
00:06:37,235 --> 00:06:39,557
- have complicated relationships.
- Right.

162
00:06:39,637 --> 00:06:41,196
I don't know how to address you.

163
00:06:41,956 --> 00:06:43,435
Call me Mr. You.

164
00:06:43,716 --> 00:06:44,715
My surname is You.

165
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:45,795
Alright.

166
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:46,916
We're kind of

167
00:06:46,996 --> 00:06:48,076
in-laws.

168
00:06:48,156 --> 00:06:50,435
- Yes.
- I just wanted to come over and check

169
00:06:50,516 --> 00:06:51,315
if there's anything

170
00:06:51,396 --> 00:06:53,036
I can help with.

171
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:54,197
No need.

172
00:06:54,277 --> 00:06:55,516
It's all bunch of stuff.

173
00:06:55,596 --> 00:06:57,156
I'll handle it myself.

174
00:06:57,795 --> 00:07:00,596
It's just the kitchen light bulb broke.

175
00:07:01,675 --> 00:07:03,035
When Mei comes around,

176
00:07:03,115 --> 00:07:04,316
I'll ask him to fix it.

177
00:07:04,396 --> 00:07:05,677
No need, why need

178
00:07:05,757 --> 00:07:07,596
Chengyi for this?

179
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:08,876
Leave it to me.

180
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:09,956
You'll do it?

181
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:11,396
Is it okay?

182
00:07:11,716 --> 00:07:12,836
Do you have a stool?

183
00:07:12,995 --> 00:07:13,636
Yes, I do.

184
00:07:13,716 --> 00:07:14,516
This will work.

185
00:07:14,596 --> 00:07:15,437
At our age,

186
00:07:15,517 --> 00:07:16,756
we can't push our limits.

187
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:18,275
It's not a big deal.

188
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,196
As men,

189
00:07:19,276 --> 00:07:19,997
we handle things

190
00:07:20,077 --> 00:07:21,595
like this at home.

191
00:07:21,675 --> 00:07:22,835
Yes, that's true.

192
00:07:22,915 --> 00:07:23,596
Leave it to me.

193
00:07:23,676 --> 00:07:25,276
Be careful then.

194
00:07:25,555 --> 00:07:26,636
Leave it to me.

195
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,956
Can you do it?

196
00:07:30,036 --> 00:07:30,795
Yes.

197
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,235
You're going up just like that?

198
00:07:32,315 --> 00:07:33,355
Careful.

199
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,555
Wait, wait.

200
00:07:38,115 --> 00:07:39,435
I'll turn off the lights.

201
00:07:39,716 --> 00:07:40,716
Okay.

202
00:07:49,516 --> 00:07:51,596
It's not the light that's broken,

203
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:54,516
it's this wire that's come loose.

204
00:07:54,716 --> 00:07:56,235
I'll just connect it back.

205
00:07:57,756 --> 00:07:59,675
Do you have tape here?

206
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:00,437
Yes, I do.

207
00:08:00,517 --> 00:08:01,956
Wait a moment, I'll go find it.

208
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:06,836
Lili.

209
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,836
I see you just moved in.

210
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:10,877
I'll see if I can

211
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:11,915
be of any help.

212
00:08:11,995 --> 00:08:14,756
You and Mr. You really think alike.

213
00:08:15,756 --> 00:08:16,756
What do you mean?

214
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:18,795
Look.

215
00:08:23,235 --> 00:08:24,235
Dad.

216
00:08:24,956 --> 00:08:26,036
Why are you here?

217
00:08:49,715 --> 00:08:51,795
Can this home manage without me?

218
00:08:54,675 --> 00:08:55,795
Dad, slow down.

219
00:08:56,276 --> 00:08:57,595
Can you handle this?

220
00:09:01,996 --> 00:09:03,075
Okay.

221
00:09:03,996 --> 00:09:04,996
You can do it.

222
00:09:08,435 --> 00:09:09,157
Lili.

223
00:09:09,237 --> 00:09:10,235
Do you need any help?

224
00:09:10,315 --> 00:09:11,396
Nope.

225
00:09:11,996 --> 00:09:13,435
No need, I can do it myself.

226
00:09:14,476 --> 00:09:15,076
Okay, fine.

227
00:09:15,156 --> 00:09:16,156
Where is Kaixin?

228
00:09:16,715 --> 00:09:17,715
In the room.

229
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:20,276
I'll go take a look.

230
00:09:20,356 --> 00:09:21,356
Okay.

231
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,355
Where are

232
00:09:23,435 --> 00:09:24,355
your principles?

233
00:09:24,435 --> 00:09:25,196
You've changed.

234
00:09:25,276 --> 00:09:26,115
You're changing

235
00:09:26,195 --> 00:09:26,917
like a chameleon.

236
00:09:26,997 --> 00:09:28,996
This is the essence of my life.

237
00:09:29,315 --> 00:09:30,755
Adapt to changes with changes.

238
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:31,796
Always pursue

239
00:09:31,876 --> 00:09:33,396
your inner needs.

240
00:09:34,036 --> 00:09:34,835
Woman,

241
00:09:34,996 --> 00:09:37,276
you have finally learned my essence.

242
00:09:37,356 --> 00:09:38,037
Congratulations.

243
00:09:38,117 --> 00:09:39,996
Life has started a new journey.

244
00:09:40,236 --> 00:09:41,555
It's so exciting.

245
00:09:47,156 --> 00:09:48,675
What you said is true?

246
00:09:49,595 --> 00:09:51,276
Really, it can't be fake at all.

247
00:09:52,756 --> 00:09:53,356
No.

248
00:09:53,436 --> 00:09:54,996
Then if I can't get along

249
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,235
with Song Ran,

250
00:09:56,315 --> 00:09:57,036
and get a divorce?

251
00:09:57,116 --> 00:09:57,836
You're married.

252
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,156
Why think about these things?

253
00:09:59,955 --> 00:10:00,916
There's no

254
00:10:00,996 --> 00:10:01,596
right answer

255
00:10:01,676 --> 00:10:02,995
for life.

256
00:10:03,075 --> 00:10:04,235
Even if you can rewind,

257
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:05,676
and you return to that point,

258
00:10:05,756 --> 00:10:06,916
make the opposite decision,

259
00:10:06,996 --> 00:10:07,516
can you

260
00:10:07,596 --> 00:10:08,835
guarantee you'll be happy?

261
00:10:11,835 --> 00:10:13,156
Why don't you go in?

262
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,075
Life is just like this,

263
00:10:16,195 --> 00:10:17,676
choosing the best among the worst.

264
00:10:17,756 --> 00:10:19,235
In the infinite unhappiness,

265
00:10:19,315 --> 00:10:20,875
pick out the limited happiness.

266
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:22,756
Let's enlarge it.

267
00:10:23,516 --> 00:10:24,516
Do you understand?

268
00:10:26,075 --> 00:10:26,677
Understood.

269
00:10:26,757 --> 00:10:27,755
Kaixin's mind

270
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,036
is full of ideas.

271
00:10:29,116 --> 00:10:30,555
No one can outtalk her.

272
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,396
We should give her a nickname.

273
00:10:32,476 --> 00:10:33,595
Call her 'Always Right'.

274
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:36,396
Growing wildly day by day.

275
00:10:37,236 --> 00:10:38,396
Endless energy.

276
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:41,555
However, she's tough-talking
but soft-hearted.

277
00:10:41,756 --> 00:10:42,955
She's a good kid.

278
00:10:43,756 --> 00:10:44,756
Mei.

279
00:10:45,715 --> 00:10:47,156
I hope

280
00:10:47,795 --> 00:10:49,675
even if you don't get married,

281
00:10:49,955 --> 00:10:51,595
you must treat her well.

282
00:10:53,156 --> 00:10:54,156
You're right.

283
00:10:54,435 --> 00:10:55,835
Kaixin is really good.

284
00:10:56,396 --> 00:10:56,996
Besides,

285
00:10:57,076 --> 00:10:58,515
we're not that young anymore.

286
00:10:58,595 --> 00:11:00,636
We're serious about every step we take.

287
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:02,835
No use saying more.

288
00:11:02,915 --> 00:11:03,996
Just look at how I behave.

289
00:11:04,435 --> 00:11:05,235
Alright.

290
00:11:05,315 --> 00:11:06,475
As for their chatting,

291
00:11:06,555 --> 00:11:07,635
it'll take quite a while.

292
00:11:07,715 --> 00:11:09,835
Why don't you sit
on the sofa for a while?

293
00:11:10,595 --> 00:11:11,437
- Alright.
- Go on.

294
00:11:11,517 --> 00:11:12,595
Then I'll sit for a while.

295
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:15,515
Are you trying to cheer me up?

296
00:11:15,595 --> 00:11:16,197
Of course,

297
00:11:16,277 --> 00:11:17,396
I'm cheering you up.

298
00:11:17,675 --> 00:11:18,596
People that care

299
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:20,675
for you will make an effort
to make you happy.

300
00:11:21,396 --> 00:11:22,796
I deeply care about you.

301
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:24,115
You should really think about

302
00:11:24,195 --> 00:11:24,996
where we go later

303
00:11:25,076 --> 00:11:26,076
to spend some money.

304
00:11:26,156 --> 00:11:27,715
We should spend a lot, right?

305
00:11:27,795 --> 00:11:29,236
And then we'll use your card.

306
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:29,956
Xu Kaixin,

307
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:30,756
your attitude now

308
00:11:30,836 --> 00:11:32,196
is just like a bad man.

309
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:33,075
I have no money.

310
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:34,355
The mall was good last time.

311
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:35,996
- I thought those clothes were...
- No.

312
00:11:41,116 --> 00:11:42,116
Dad,

313
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:44,396
does Mom know you came here?

314
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:47,435
You're lecturing me?

315
00:11:48,236 --> 00:11:49,355
Your girlfriend is moving.

316
00:11:49,435 --> 00:11:51,276
Why can't I come and help?

317
00:11:51,915 --> 00:11:53,476
I came by yesterday, didn't I?

318
00:11:54,356 --> 00:11:55,356
Yesterday.

319
00:11:56,435 --> 00:11:57,435
Yesterday.

320
00:11:58,116 --> 00:11:59,876
You seem to not have
eaten dinner, right?

321
00:12:00,315 --> 00:12:01,276
Come on.

322
00:12:01,356 --> 00:12:03,795
Come eat some fruit.

323
00:12:08,476 --> 00:12:09,595
I have to go back.

324
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:11,196
I suddenly remembered

325
00:12:11,276 --> 00:12:12,595
there's a pile of work at home

326
00:12:12,675 --> 00:12:13,796
waiting for me.

327
00:12:13,876 --> 00:12:14,916
You're leaving now?

328
00:12:14,996 --> 00:12:15,515
You...

329
00:12:15,595 --> 00:12:16,595
How about

330
00:12:16,715 --> 00:12:17,676
taking this fruit

331
00:12:17,756 --> 00:12:18,916
to your wife?

332
00:12:18,996 --> 00:12:19,996
Alright.

333
00:12:20,116 --> 00:12:21,116
No.

334
00:12:22,036 --> 00:12:23,955
It's not proper.

335
00:12:24,996 --> 00:12:25,875
It's fine, Lili.

336
00:12:25,955 --> 00:12:26,596
If he eats here,

337
00:12:26,676 --> 00:12:27,955
then no food for him back home.

338
00:12:28,156 --> 00:12:28,797
Dad, bye.

339
00:12:28,877 --> 00:12:30,156
I'll see you off.

340
00:13:12,476 --> 00:13:13,476
Trash.

341
00:13:21,236 --> 00:13:22,236
Mom.

342
00:13:24,276 --> 00:13:25,356
I want a divorce.

343
00:13:28,116 --> 00:13:29,236
That's good.

344
00:13:29,516 --> 00:13:30,595
Congratulations, darling.

345
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:32,875
You're about to enjoy

346
00:13:32,955 --> 00:13:34,636
an even more beautiful love.

347
00:13:34,915 --> 00:13:36,555
Mom, why are you so happy?

348
00:13:36,636 --> 00:13:37,956
Of course I'm happy.

349
00:13:38,036 --> 00:13:38,596
You know,

350
00:13:38,676 --> 00:13:39,676
when you came out

351
00:13:39,756 --> 00:13:40,476
yesterday,

352
00:13:40,556 --> 00:13:42,156
you were as pale as a sheet.

353
00:13:42,756 --> 00:13:43,476
I was worried

354
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:45,156
that I would become a lonely old lady.

355
00:13:45,555 --> 00:13:46,755
Look at you now,

356
00:13:46,835 --> 00:13:48,315
lying here in comfort,

357
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:49,555
and calling me Mom.

358
00:13:50,835 --> 00:13:52,676
Can you say I shouldn't be happy?

359
00:13:52,756 --> 00:13:54,435
And you are planning for the future.

360
00:13:54,756 --> 00:13:55,835
I really have to thank

361
00:13:55,915 --> 00:13:58,595
all the gods in the world.

362
00:13:59,516 --> 00:14:00,317
But I can't be a mom

363
00:14:00,397 --> 00:14:01,996
in this lifetime.

364
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:05,835
Mom, tell me,

365
00:14:06,036 --> 00:14:06,917
will I ever

366
00:14:06,997 --> 00:14:08,236
meet true love again?

367
00:14:08,876 --> 00:14:10,435
What nonsense are you talking about?

368
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:12,636
Does romance have anything
to do with the womb?

369
00:14:12,955 --> 00:14:14,756
You were still
talking about it yesterday.

370
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:16,916
You said Aunt can't have children.

371
00:14:16,996 --> 00:14:18,995
You and Grandma want them to break up.

372
00:14:19,075 --> 00:14:19,756
Your thoughts

373
00:14:19,836 --> 00:14:21,715
haven't unchanged till now.

374
00:14:22,075 --> 00:14:23,755
See, you're being silly again.

375
00:14:23,835 --> 00:14:25,955
She's an outsider, but you're family.

376
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:27,396
For her, it's about reason.

377
00:14:27,756 --> 00:14:29,315
For you, it's about emotion.

378
00:14:29,516 --> 00:14:31,795
You and Grandma have double standards.

379
00:14:32,036 --> 00:14:33,076
Of course.

380
00:14:33,156 --> 00:14:34,875
The human heart is inherently selfish.

381
00:14:34,955 --> 00:14:36,915
According to what your grandma says,

382
00:14:37,435 --> 00:14:38,435
it's protecting your own.

383
00:14:38,955 --> 00:14:39,677
Darling,

384
00:14:39,757 --> 00:14:41,555
if you want to divorce, then do it.

385
00:14:41,636 --> 00:14:43,555
Once you're done, let's go abroad.

386
00:14:44,116 --> 00:14:46,956
There are plenty of handsome men
with blonde hair and blue eyes.

387
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:48,435
There are plenty of DINKs.

388
00:14:48,876 --> 00:14:50,475
Let's forget about the womb

389
00:14:50,555 --> 00:14:51,595
and embrace freedom.

390
00:14:53,156 --> 00:14:54,835
Alright, stop crying, darling.

391
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:56,195
Look at you.

392
00:14:57,195 --> 00:14:58,195
Mom,

393
00:14:58,396 --> 00:14:59,956
I've asked Qian Hao for a divorce.

394
00:15:00,036 --> 00:15:01,116
He hasn't said anything.

395
00:15:01,675 --> 00:15:03,316
I'm worried he'll drag it out

396
00:15:03,396 --> 00:15:04,595
like before.

397
00:15:05,636 --> 00:15:06,197
Right now,

398
00:15:06,277 --> 00:15:07,436
you don't need to worry.

399
00:15:07,516 --> 00:15:08,595
Let me tell you,

400
00:15:08,915 --> 00:15:10,595
your uncle

401
00:15:11,075 --> 00:15:12,916
is a bit weak internally,

402
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,316
but to outsiders, he's tough.

403
00:15:14,396 --> 00:15:16,036
Just leave this matter to him.

404
00:15:16,195 --> 00:15:17,195
Come on,

405
00:15:19,996 --> 00:15:20,996
you need nutrition.

406
00:15:22,276 --> 00:15:23,996
Thanks for not being mad at me.

407
00:15:25,236 --> 00:15:26,115
Silly girl.

408
00:15:26,195 --> 00:15:27,195
What's to be mad about?

409
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,195
Here,

410
00:15:29,516 --> 00:15:30,795
have a bite.

411
00:15:30,915 --> 00:15:31,915
Replenish a bit.

412
00:15:32,075 --> 00:15:33,996
I'll dance for you.

413
00:15:34,195 --> 00:15:35,195
Alright.

414
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:39,796
Mom.

415
00:15:39,876 --> 00:15:40,397
♪Love is♪

416
00:15:40,477 --> 00:15:42,516
Mom, my stomach hurts from laughing.

417
00:15:43,396 --> 00:15:44,396
Okay.

418
00:15:44,516 --> 00:15:45,356
Gently, gently.

419
00:15:45,476 --> 00:15:46,476
I won't sing anymore.

420
00:15:59,036 --> 00:16:00,036
Mom.

421
00:16:00,996 --> 00:16:02,555
- Hey.
- Son.

422
00:16:05,636 --> 00:16:07,396
You look much better.

423
00:16:07,476 --> 00:16:08,475
Exactly.

424
00:16:08,555 --> 00:16:10,635
Even if I'm fighting
with the Grim Reaper,

425
00:16:10,715 --> 00:16:11,956
I need to get through this.

426
00:16:12,036 --> 00:16:13,396
I want to see Xiaojiao's son

427
00:16:13,476 --> 00:16:14,516
be born.

428
00:16:17,516 --> 00:16:18,516
What's wrong?

429
00:16:20,555 --> 00:16:21,555
Where's Xiaojiao?

430
00:16:21,715 --> 00:16:22,756
Why didn't she come?

431
00:16:24,555 --> 00:16:26,996
She's heavily pregnant.
It's inconvenient.

432
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:30,996
You don't look well.

433
00:16:31,476 --> 00:16:32,756
Are you feeling unwell?

434
00:16:33,675 --> 00:16:34,795
You scared me.

435
00:16:35,835 --> 00:16:37,595
You can't scare me like this again.

436
00:16:37,675 --> 00:16:38,756
I can't handle it.

437
00:16:39,876 --> 00:16:41,036
After this,

438
00:16:41,116 --> 00:16:42,636
I realized something.

439
00:16:43,876 --> 00:16:44,437
You

440
00:16:44,517 --> 00:16:45,796
will be with your wife

441
00:16:45,876 --> 00:16:47,195
for a lifetime.

442
00:16:47,636 --> 00:16:49,555
I can't be with you for a lifetime.

443
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:51,835
After I'm discharged,

444
00:16:52,156 --> 00:16:53,756
I'll treat Xiaojiao well.

445
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,795
I'll not neglect her.

446
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,595
If you need to scold her,
just say it. It's fine.

447
00:17:03,915 --> 00:17:05,436
Come out with me for a moment.

448
00:17:05,756 --> 00:17:07,475
The doctor said we need
to pay something.

449
00:17:07,555 --> 00:17:08,437
I didn't understand.

450
00:17:08,517 --> 00:17:09,795
Nowadays, this hospital

451
00:17:09,875 --> 00:17:11,396
keeps having new machines installed.

452
00:17:11,476 --> 00:17:12,835
Old people really don't get it.

453
00:17:23,516 --> 00:17:24,315
What's wrong?

454
00:17:24,436 --> 00:17:25,835
What money hasn't been paid yet?

455
00:17:26,196 --> 00:17:27,196
What's with your face?

456
00:17:29,835 --> 00:17:30,835
What's wrong?

457
00:17:33,036 --> 00:17:34,315
Xiaojiao's uncle hit me.

458
00:17:34,395 --> 00:17:35,395
What?

459
00:17:35,676 --> 00:17:36,795
He hit you?

460
00:17:37,395 --> 00:17:38,196
On what grounds?

461
00:17:38,355 --> 00:17:39,236
I'll go find him.

462
00:17:39,316 --> 00:17:40,835
Let's see what he can do to me.

463
00:17:41,476 --> 00:17:42,716
I can't believe you.

464
00:17:43,036 --> 00:17:44,356
Why are you such a pushover?

465
00:17:44,436 --> 00:17:46,235
I find you quite amusing.

466
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,275
When a bully beat me,

467
00:17:47,355 --> 00:17:48,355
I came back to find you.

468
00:17:48,436 --> 00:17:49,196
What did you say?

469
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,315
'Why they pick on you?'

470
00:17:50,395 --> 00:17:51,596
And gave me a beating.

471
00:17:51,676 --> 00:17:52,357
What now?

472
00:17:52,437 --> 00:17:53,596
You're quite old

473
00:17:53,676 --> 00:17:54,795
and feel sorry for your son?

474
00:17:57,196 --> 00:17:59,155
Your grandfather used
to beat me like this too.

475
00:18:02,764 --> 00:18:08,248
(Caring for Health)

476
00:18:08,555 --> 00:18:09,756
I find myself quite amusing.

477
00:18:10,315 --> 00:18:11,116
When I was young,

478
00:18:11,196 --> 00:18:12,196
I didn't want to be you.

479
00:18:14,036 --> 00:18:15,155
But after growing up,

480
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:17,875
I suddenly realized

481
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:20,555
that I became you.

482
00:18:34,555 --> 00:18:36,155
Don't cause trouble for them either.

483
00:18:37,436 --> 00:18:38,595
We are getting a divorce.

484
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:39,716
Divorce?

485
00:18:40,355 --> 00:18:40,877
No.

486
00:18:40,957 --> 00:18:42,036
Impossible.

487
00:18:42,555 --> 00:18:43,956
I understand women.

488
00:18:44,075 --> 00:18:45,196
She can't live without you.

489
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:46,555
Can't drive her away.

490
00:18:50,555 --> 00:18:52,155
Then please analyze for me.

491
00:18:53,315 --> 00:18:54,275
How did I make

492
00:18:54,355 --> 00:18:55,716
two women who can't be without me

493
00:18:56,395 --> 00:18:57,436
end up wanting to leave me

494
00:18:57,516 --> 00:18:58,516
desperately?

495
00:19:08,516 --> 00:19:09,197
Kaixin.

496
00:19:09,277 --> 00:19:10,315
I'll buy extra large.

497
00:19:10,395 --> 00:19:12,516
- Let me tell you.
- Extra large is bigger than...

498
00:19:13,516 --> 00:19:14,795
Hello, cutie.

499
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:16,036
Lili.

500
00:19:16,116 --> 00:19:17,156
There's something at work.

501
00:19:17,236 --> 00:19:18,075
I'm leaving.

502
00:19:18,236 --> 00:19:18,877
Why leave?

503
00:19:18,957 --> 00:19:20,315
Stay for dinner.

504
00:19:20,436 --> 00:19:21,076
Let her go.

505
00:19:21,156 --> 00:19:22,235
She's a married rich lady.

506
00:19:22,315 --> 00:19:22,995
She's busy.

507
00:19:23,075 --> 00:19:24,075
Bye.

508
00:19:24,315 --> 00:19:25,116
Take care.

509
00:19:25,196 --> 00:19:26,315
- Alright.
- Bye.

510
00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:27,956
Married rich lady?

511
00:19:28,075 --> 00:19:29,555
Let her explain it to you later.

512
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,036
Why did you come over?

513
00:19:36,036 --> 00:19:38,196
To discuss the contract with you.

514
00:19:38,516 --> 00:19:40,315
What contract, what kind of contract?

515
00:19:42,395 --> 00:19:43,756
I'm afraid

516
00:19:43,956 --> 00:19:45,916
that you take everything
and don't admit it.

517
00:19:46,036 --> 00:19:47,116
How is that possible?

518
00:19:47,196 --> 00:19:47,796
Weren't we

519
00:19:47,876 --> 00:19:49,315
satisfied with each other yesterday?

520
00:19:50,075 --> 00:19:51,115
Satisfied with what?

521
00:19:53,115 --> 00:19:54,395
I was saying

522
00:19:55,436 --> 00:19:56,596
it's impressive

523
00:19:56,676 --> 00:19:57,756
how he helped me yesterday.

524
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,315
Look at these muscles.

525
00:19:59,516 --> 00:20:01,436
He moved those boxes out one by one

526
00:20:01,516 --> 00:20:02,676
without stopping.

527
00:20:02,756 --> 00:20:04,156
Yes, he's good.

528
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,236
Thumbs up to you.

529
00:20:05,555 --> 00:20:06,555
Thank you, Lili.

530
00:20:07,075 --> 00:20:08,716
I'm taking her out to discuss something.

531
00:20:09,036 --> 00:20:09,836
Go ahead.

532
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:10,836
Take your time.

533
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:11,916
Go ahead.

534
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:22,115
Alright, you're quite good
at making things up.

535
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:23,755
Stop joking around.

536
00:20:23,835 --> 00:20:24,835
Let's talk seriously.

537
00:20:25,395 --> 00:20:27,635
About that contract of ours...

538
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,676
(Qian Hao)

539
00:20:31,996 --> 00:20:33,516
Bad omen, I'm not answering it.

540
00:20:34,996 --> 00:20:35,756
Answer it.

541
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,315
After all, his mom is critically ill.

542
00:20:38,476 --> 00:20:39,075
Right?

543
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,155
We'll talk later.

544
00:20:40,956 --> 00:20:41,996
That's reasonable.

545
00:20:44,516 --> 00:20:45,475
Hello.

546
00:20:45,555 --> 00:20:46,355
Well...

547
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:47,836
My mom is out of the ICU now.

548
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,115
She wants to see Xiaomi.

549
00:20:49,236 --> 00:20:50,196
Okay, but you need

550
00:20:50,276 --> 00:20:51,756
to sign an agreement with me first.

551
00:20:52,476 --> 00:20:53,476
What agreement?

552
00:20:53,716 --> 00:20:54,956
If you take Xiaomi

553
00:20:55,036 --> 00:20:56,716
without permission again,

554
00:20:56,835 --> 00:20:57,916
half of premarital assets

555
00:20:57,996 --> 00:20:59,115
will immediately be mine.

556
00:20:59,476 --> 00:21:00,595
Sign and stamp it.

557
00:21:00,716 --> 00:21:01,956
Xiaomi should be delivered

558
00:21:02,036 --> 00:21:03,236
to the hospital in an hour.

559
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:07,555
Let's have some humanity, okay?

560
00:21:08,036 --> 00:21:09,035
Right now, my mom

561
00:21:09,115 --> 00:21:09,676
is almost

562
00:21:09,756 --> 00:21:10,677
at her last gasp.

563
00:21:10,757 --> 00:21:12,196
Her only wish is to see

564
00:21:12,276 --> 00:21:12,995
her grandchild.

565
00:21:13,075 --> 00:21:13,917
Now you're

566
00:21:13,997 --> 00:21:15,315
using the house against me.

567
00:21:15,835 --> 00:21:17,235
Humanity is for treating people.

568
00:21:17,315 --> 00:21:18,555
Not you.

569
00:21:24,036 --> 00:21:24,995
I know I took Xiaomi

570
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,075
without permission.

571
00:21:26,155 --> 00:21:27,555
It was my fault, okay?

572
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,795
I was wrong, and I apologize to you.

573
00:21:30,236 --> 00:21:31,036
I promise

574
00:21:31,116 --> 00:21:32,636
such a thing will never happen again.

575
00:21:32,716 --> 00:21:33,996
But right now,

576
00:21:34,196 --> 00:21:35,956
let's think about the elder, okay?

577
00:21:36,036 --> 00:21:37,755
It's a matter of human decency, right?

578
00:21:37,835 --> 00:21:38,556
When you need it,

579
00:21:38,636 --> 00:21:40,395
you talk to me about human decency.

580
00:21:40,476 --> 00:21:41,235
Qian Hao,

581
00:21:41,315 --> 00:21:42,956
shouldn't you wash your face more often?

582
00:21:43,036 --> 00:21:43,796
You're not even

583
00:21:43,876 --> 00:21:45,115
shameless of your words.

584
00:21:45,956 --> 00:21:48,235
Xu Kaixin, you...

585
00:21:48,315 --> 00:21:48,956
If you agree,

586
00:21:49,036 --> 00:21:49,836
then we continue.

587
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,475
If not, then don't waste my time.

588
00:21:51,555 --> 00:21:52,555
Bye.

589
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:10,795
Awesome!

590
00:22:11,155 --> 00:22:12,476
I've long wanted to confront him.

591
00:22:15,155 --> 00:22:16,155
What's wrong?

592
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:19,555
Did I go too far?

593
00:22:23,395 --> 00:22:24,436
Just a little bit,

594
00:22:24,516 --> 00:22:25,635
a little bit.

595
00:22:25,795 --> 00:22:26,357
But I think

596
00:22:26,437 --> 00:22:28,155
most of it wasn't too much.

597
00:22:28,516 --> 00:22:29,716
After all,

598
00:22:29,996 --> 00:22:32,436
his mom is seriously ill.

599
00:22:32,516 --> 00:22:33,516
I understand.

600
00:22:34,036 --> 00:22:35,115
I'll humbly accept it,

601
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:36,516
but I won't change.

602
00:22:40,204 --> 00:22:47,128
(Yongshou Cemetery Management Office)

603
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:04,155
If it's yours, no need to fight for it.

604
00:23:04,555 --> 00:23:06,436
If it's not yours,
begging won't bring it.

605
00:23:09,276 --> 00:23:10,956
Yiersan.

606
00:23:11,476 --> 00:23:12,475
You've been here

607
00:23:12,555 --> 00:23:13,476
for most of your life.

608
00:23:13,556 --> 00:23:14,876
How come you can't figure out

609
00:23:14,956 --> 00:23:16,236
this simple philosophy of life?

610
00:23:20,115 --> 00:23:21,115
You like her so much.

611
00:23:22,996 --> 00:23:24,115
What if in the future,

612
00:23:24,555 --> 00:23:25,595
I'm not around anymore,

613
00:23:27,075 --> 00:23:28,236
would you want to follow her?

614
00:23:29,996 --> 00:23:31,716
You little ingrate.

615
00:23:32,635 --> 00:23:33,596
Alright,

616
00:23:33,676 --> 00:23:35,956
then we won't hire new people for now,

617
00:23:36,996 --> 00:23:37,996
we'll just keep waiting

618
00:23:39,555 --> 00:23:40,916
and hope to move the heavens.

619
00:23:42,395 --> 00:23:43,395
Maybe

620
00:23:43,996 --> 00:23:45,436
one day she might come back again.

621
00:24:09,595 --> 00:24:10,595
You're back?

622
00:24:14,476 --> 00:24:15,995
How did you silently

623
00:24:16,075 --> 00:24:17,075
stand here?

624
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:18,956
You look frightening.

625
00:24:19,395 --> 00:24:20,795
I can't sleep everyday

626
00:24:20,956 --> 00:24:22,155
thinking about Youyou.

627
00:24:22,555 --> 00:24:24,395
No wonder I look terrible.

628
00:24:25,835 --> 00:24:27,835
I couldn't sleep again last night.

629
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,036
I can live one more day.

630
00:25:01,036 --> 00:25:02,595
Youyou has been starving for days.

631
00:25:02,676 --> 00:25:03,716
What if she falls ill?

632
00:25:04,595 --> 00:25:05,835
What could possibly be wrong?

633
00:25:06,315 --> 00:25:07,516
I think she's doing fine.

634
00:25:08,595 --> 00:25:09,596
Last night at eleven,

635
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:10,357
you asked me

636
00:25:10,437 --> 00:25:12,115
to secretly check on Youyou.

637
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:15,075
Usually at this time,

638
00:25:15,476 --> 00:25:16,555
she is energetic

639
00:25:16,635 --> 00:25:17,835
playing games.

640
00:25:18,716 --> 00:25:20,196
When I went in yesterday,

641
00:25:21,115 --> 00:25:22,835
she was sleeping soundly.

642
00:25:23,676 --> 00:25:24,676
Like a baby.

643
00:25:26,516 --> 00:25:27,635
It's fine now,

644
00:25:28,075 --> 00:25:29,436
but that doesn't mean it'll last.

645
00:25:30,676 --> 00:25:31,916
This needs to be resolved.

646
00:25:33,315 --> 00:25:34,996
You're the one who started this.

647
00:25:35,155 --> 00:25:36,635
You can't just ignore it.

648
00:25:37,555 --> 00:25:39,075
What does this have to do with me?

649
00:25:39,155 --> 00:25:40,995
You wanted to follow Youyou to work.

650
00:25:41,075 --> 00:25:41,756
Otherwise,

651
00:25:41,836 --> 00:25:42,996
nothing would happen.

652
00:25:43,835 --> 00:25:45,956
Don't kid yourself.

653
00:25:46,036 --> 00:25:47,036
Do you understand?

654
00:25:47,516 --> 00:25:49,075
Even if we didn't know

655
00:25:49,315 --> 00:25:50,676
that Youyou works at the cemetery,

656
00:25:50,756 --> 00:25:52,396
this is an undeniable fact.

657
00:25:52,476 --> 00:25:53,476
So what if it is?

658
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,397
If I don't know,

659
00:25:54,477 --> 00:25:55,436
then it doesn't exist.

660
00:25:55,516 --> 00:25:56,236
Once I know,

661
00:25:56,316 --> 00:25:57,795
I can't sleep all night.

662
00:25:57,875 --> 00:25:59,596
So, I stay up all night.

663
00:25:59,676 --> 00:26:00,556
It's all your fault.

664
00:26:00,636 --> 00:26:02,315
If you don't take responsibility,
who will?

665
00:26:04,795 --> 00:26:05,996
That seems right.

666
00:26:09,075 --> 00:26:10,075
How about this?

667
00:26:10,395 --> 00:26:12,075
Let's go to the cemetery once more

668
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:13,436
to find her mentor.

669
00:26:13,516 --> 00:26:15,916
Ask him to talk Youyou out of it.

670
00:26:18,516 --> 00:26:19,795
I have an idea.

671
00:26:20,075 --> 00:26:22,315
Let's simply give him some money.

672
00:26:23,036 --> 00:26:24,676
Tell him to fire Youyou.

673
00:26:24,756 --> 00:26:25,795
Hire someone else.

674
00:26:26,036 --> 00:26:26,716
Even if

675
00:26:26,796 --> 00:26:28,595
Youyou wants to return, she can't.

676
00:26:31,236 --> 00:26:32,236
Where you going?

677
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:33,916
To the cemetery.

678
00:26:34,516 --> 00:26:35,516
Now?

679
00:26:39,555 --> 00:26:41,075
Here, have some water.

680
00:26:43,756 --> 00:26:45,315
Want an apple?

681
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:49,036
What's wrong? Are you feeling unwell?

682
00:26:49,635 --> 00:26:50,835
What do you think?

683
00:26:50,956 --> 00:26:52,196
It's just fussing.

684
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:53,595
Wants to see her grandson.

685
00:26:54,956 --> 00:26:56,676
I just came back from

686
00:26:56,756 --> 00:26:57,756
the brink of death.

687
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:59,356
I want to see my grandson.

688
00:26:59,436 --> 00:27:00,515
How am I fussing?

689
00:27:00,595 --> 00:27:02,115
Alright, it's fine.

690
00:27:02,676 --> 00:27:04,395
Wanting to see your grandson
is very normal.

691
00:27:04,516 --> 00:27:05,715
Xiaomi was here

692
00:27:05,795 --> 00:27:06,956
while you were unconscious.

693
00:27:07,036 --> 00:27:08,275
He's at kindergarten now.

694
00:27:08,355 --> 00:27:09,355
He'll come back.

695
00:27:11,595 --> 00:27:12,276
Bring him back

696
00:27:12,356 --> 00:27:13,676
when he finishes school.

697
00:27:15,115 --> 00:27:17,436
I don't have much time.

698
00:27:17,835 --> 00:27:18,996
Mom, don't say that.

699
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,116
I'll bring him over in a while.

700
00:27:21,196 --> 00:27:21,796
In your state,

701
00:27:21,876 --> 00:27:23,516
he must be here to accompany you.

702
00:27:28,395 --> 00:27:29,595
I miss him now.

703
00:27:30,155 --> 00:27:31,916
I miss him so much that my heart hurts.

704
00:27:32,555 --> 00:27:33,515
What exactly

705
00:27:33,595 --> 00:27:35,196
is with you?

706
00:27:35,916 --> 00:27:37,356
Do you actually want the child,

707
00:27:37,436 --> 00:27:38,676
or do you want to torment him?

708
00:27:38,756 --> 00:27:39,756
Enough, Dad.

709
00:27:41,236 --> 00:27:41,995
It's okay, Mom.

710
00:27:42,075 --> 00:27:43,636
I'll go get him now, okay?

711
00:27:43,716 --> 00:27:44,316
I'll go get

712
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,156
whatever you want, okay?

713
00:27:46,236 --> 00:27:47,236
I'm going right now.

714
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:59,397
(Sunshine Kindergarten)

715
00:28:04,956 --> 00:28:05,637
Can I help you?

716
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,075
I'm the parent of Qian Xiaomi.

717
00:28:07,155 --> 00:28:08,875
Could you please find Miss Lu?

718
00:28:08,956 --> 00:28:09,996
Alright, please wait.

719
00:28:28,716 --> 00:28:29,716
Miss Lu.

720
00:28:30,196 --> 00:28:30,756
- Thanks.
- Hi.

721
00:28:30,836 --> 00:28:31,876
I'm here for Qian Xiaomi.

722
00:28:31,956 --> 00:28:32,916
Qian Xiaomi has already

723
00:28:32,996 --> 00:28:34,276
left this kindergarten.

724
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:36,597
Not here anymore?

725
00:28:36,677 --> 00:28:38,395
His mom transferred him
to another school.

726
00:28:38,476 --> 00:28:39,476
No, he...

727
00:28:40,036 --> 00:28:41,555
He changed kindergartens so suddenly?

728
00:28:41,635 --> 00:28:42,956
If you are lying to me,

729
00:28:43,036 --> 00:28:44,475
I'll report you to the bureau.

730
00:28:44,555 --> 00:28:45,596
Feel free to do it,

731
00:28:45,676 --> 00:28:46,835
but he's still not here.

732
00:28:47,875 --> 00:28:48,956
Sorry, I have to work.

733
00:28:49,036 --> 00:28:50,036
I'll head back first.

734
00:28:50,355 --> 00:28:51,635
What's with your attitude?

735
00:29:08,524 --> 00:29:10,296
(Qian Hao)

736
00:29:11,355 --> 00:29:12,355
Xu Kaixin.

737
00:29:13,355 --> 00:29:14,835
Act first, report later, huh.

738
00:29:15,835 --> 00:29:17,436
You're so sneaky.

739
00:29:21,635 --> 00:29:22,635
Shameless.

740
00:29:28,716 --> 00:29:29,716
You want war?

741
00:29:33,635 --> 00:29:34,635
I'm game.

742
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:46,835
(Tianya)
(How's it going?)

743
00:29:46,996 --> 00:29:48,235
(How have you been these days?)

744
00:29:48,315 --> 00:29:49,795
(I've been very worried about you.)

745
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:52,916
(Hu Xiaojiao)
(Getting by.)

746
00:29:53,555 --> 00:29:54,996
(I'm planning to get a divorce.)

747
00:29:55,635 --> 00:29:57,635
(Abandon mistakes, stop losses in time.)

748
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:59,476
(Finally, it's off my mind.)

749
00:30:00,036 --> 00:30:01,036
(Kind of relieved.)

750
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:04,795
(Congratulations,
you're going to get rich.)

751
00:30:08,476 --> 00:30:09,476
(Why?)

752
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:12,635
(Success in love, failure in gambling.)

753
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:14,795
(Failure in love
means success in gambling.)

754
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:15,875
(Trust me.)

755
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,396
(But it)

756
00:30:17,476 --> 00:30:19,075
(doesn't mean real gambling,)

757
00:30:19,716 --> 00:30:21,196
(but rather your fortune.)

758
00:30:21,436 --> 00:30:22,716
(You should seize it well.)

759
00:30:24,436 --> 00:30:25,436
(Really?)

760
00:30:27,436 --> 00:30:27,996
(Of course.)

761
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,115
(If you don't believe it,
buy a lottery ticket.)

762
00:30:35,395 --> 00:30:36,676
Who makes you that happy?

763
00:30:36,756 --> 00:30:37,916
It can't be Qian Hao, right?

764
00:30:39,155 --> 00:30:39,917
Listen up.

765
00:30:39,997 --> 00:30:40,995
Other than the divorce,

766
00:30:41,075 --> 00:30:43,036
don't talk to him anymore.

767
00:30:43,916 --> 00:30:45,835
A friend advising me
to buy a lottery ticket.

768
00:30:46,115 --> 00:30:46,796
Friend?

769
00:30:46,876 --> 00:30:48,436
(Made some money recently.)

770
00:30:48,595 --> 00:30:49,396
(Here's a gift.)

771
00:30:49,476 --> 00:30:49,995
What?

772
00:30:50,075 --> 00:30:51,075
(Celebrating new life.)

773
00:30:51,276 --> 00:30:52,555
(The first boba this summer.)

774
00:30:52,635 --> 00:30:53,356
(It's on me.)

775
00:30:53,436 --> 00:30:55,315
This little money?

776
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:55,996
Even calls it

777
00:30:56,076 --> 00:30:57,635
the first boba this summer?

778
00:30:58,676 --> 00:31:00,035
Honey, who is this person?

779
00:31:00,115 --> 00:31:01,115
What's this?

780
00:31:01,795 --> 00:31:03,196
After I returned to the country,

781
00:31:03,276 --> 00:31:04,676
a random cup of boba

782
00:31:04,756 --> 00:31:06,236
costs ten to twenty.

783
00:31:06,355 --> 00:31:07,395
Five and twenty cents?

784
00:31:07,555 --> 00:31:08,755
More like buying

785
00:31:08,835 --> 00:31:09,835
a bottle of water.

786
00:31:10,555 --> 00:31:12,276
Move the decimal point
back one position,

787
00:31:12,595 --> 00:31:13,676
then I won't scold him.

788
00:31:13,756 --> 00:31:14,756
Collect payment.

789
00:31:15,555 --> 00:31:16,315
You took it?

790
00:31:16,395 --> 00:31:17,036
Of course.

791
00:31:17,116 --> 00:31:18,395
Why shouldn't I take it?

792
00:31:19,155 --> 00:31:20,476
You know,

793
00:31:20,835 --> 00:31:22,156
I have been abroad for years.

794
00:31:22,236 --> 00:31:23,436
Feelings have been hurt.

795
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:24,595
But my money

796
00:31:25,595 --> 00:31:27,595
hasn't been cheated away.

797
00:31:27,756 --> 00:31:28,597
Even in a breakup,

798
00:31:28,677 --> 00:31:30,035
I'd still

799
00:31:30,115 --> 00:31:30,957
get some money

800
00:31:31,037 --> 00:31:32,196
from those stingy foreigners.

801
00:31:33,355 --> 00:31:34,276
With the spirit

802
00:31:34,356 --> 00:31:36,395
of not despising small gains, I managed

803
00:31:36,956 --> 00:31:38,196
to make our family business

804
00:31:38,276 --> 00:31:40,075
in good shape.

805
00:31:40,876 --> 00:31:41,720
(Payment Received)

806
00:31:43,716 --> 00:31:45,276
She accepted it.

807
00:31:45,516 --> 00:31:46,795
This piglet took the bait.

808
00:31:46,875 --> 00:31:47,836
Come on.

809
00:31:47,916 --> 00:31:48,916
Five and twenty cents?

810
00:31:49,595 --> 00:31:50,995
You're too stingy.

811
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,035
Even a slightly

812
00:31:52,115 --> 00:31:53,315
bigger amount would be fine.

813
00:31:53,395 --> 00:31:54,436
Nowadays,

814
00:31:54,835 --> 00:31:57,396
all industries are reducing costs
and increasing efficiency.

815
00:31:57,476 --> 00:31:58,835
I'm responding to the market call.

816
00:31:59,196 --> 00:32:00,235
Accepting a small amount

817
00:32:00,315 --> 00:32:01,275
shows what?

818
00:32:01,355 --> 00:32:03,315
It shows this piglet is greedy

819
00:32:03,395 --> 00:32:04,436
and more easily fooled.

820
00:32:04,516 --> 00:32:06,676
The perfect target.

821
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:11,036
Impressive.

822
00:32:13,075 --> 00:32:14,315
Your training was worthwhile.

823
00:32:24,595 --> 00:32:25,836
I feel this person

824
00:32:25,916 --> 00:32:27,196
is kind of off.

825
00:32:27,996 --> 00:32:29,075
Another voice message.

826
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,155
Listen.

827
00:32:34,155 --> 00:32:35,676
Love makes people blind.

828
00:32:35,835 --> 00:32:36,716
But money

829
00:32:36,796 --> 00:32:38,156
will never betray you.

830
00:32:38,236 --> 00:32:39,036
If you get divorced,

831
00:32:39,116 --> 00:32:40,275
remember to protect

832
00:32:40,355 --> 00:32:41,355
your own rights well.

833
00:32:41,555 --> 00:32:43,235
Also, think about the future.

834
00:32:43,315 --> 00:32:44,356
As for financial issues,

835
00:32:44,436 --> 00:32:45,596
I can help you.

836
00:32:45,676 --> 00:32:46,715
I recently invested.

837
00:32:46,795 --> 00:32:48,075
The returns are quite good.

838
00:32:48,155 --> 00:32:49,116
What?

839
00:32:49,196 --> 00:32:50,956
He just recommended an investment to me.

840
00:32:51,036 --> 00:32:52,276
Isn't it a kind gesture?

841
00:32:53,595 --> 00:32:56,636
This is clearly a scammer.

842
00:32:56,716 --> 00:32:58,635
It's the terminology
of a 'pig-butchering scam'.

843
00:32:58,956 --> 00:33:00,036
No way, Mom.

844
00:33:00,635 --> 00:33:01,516
I've been chatting

845
00:33:01,596 --> 00:33:02,596
with him for a long time.

846
00:33:02,676 --> 00:33:03,956
When I was unhappy,

847
00:33:04,036 --> 00:33:04,716
he'd chat with me

848
00:33:04,796 --> 00:33:05,916
all night.

849
00:33:06,716 --> 00:33:07,316
Oh, god.

850
00:33:07,396 --> 00:33:08,715
How could you be so silly?

851
00:33:08,795 --> 00:33:09,795
I really...

852
00:33:10,036 --> 00:33:11,596
I really don't know what your uncle

853
00:33:11,676 --> 00:33:13,835
and aunt taught you.

854
00:33:13,916 --> 00:33:14,996
You

855
00:33:15,875 --> 00:33:17,236
are emotionally simple,

856
00:33:17,355 --> 00:33:18,356
but your mind

857
00:33:18,436 --> 00:33:20,236
is also so simple.

858
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,875
The most patient person in the world

859
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:25,595
is a scammer.

860
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,356
He is a patient hunter.

861
00:33:27,436 --> 00:33:28,436
Do you understand?

862
00:33:29,036 --> 00:33:29,715
So, after

863
00:33:29,795 --> 00:33:30,396
the divorce,

864
00:33:30,476 --> 00:33:31,236
go back with me,

865
00:33:31,316 --> 00:33:32,475
inherit the family business,

866
00:33:32,555 --> 00:33:34,595
take it over, and hone it.

867
00:33:35,436 --> 00:33:36,436
Let me tell you,

868
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,595
I'm very tolerant of you.

869
00:33:39,075 --> 00:33:40,476
Even if you are love-struck,

870
00:33:40,635 --> 00:33:41,635
never mind.

871
00:33:41,996 --> 00:33:44,356
But there must always be
a moment of clarity.

872
00:33:44,436 --> 00:33:47,156
Mom, you're overthinking things
too much.

873
00:33:47,236 --> 00:33:48,235
Can we be a little kind

874
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:50,115
to the world?

875
00:33:52,236 --> 00:33:54,235
Okay, give me the phone.

876
00:33:54,315 --> 00:33:55,315
What are you doing?

877
00:33:55,436 --> 00:33:57,396
I want you to see the real truth

878
00:33:57,476 --> 00:33:59,196
of this world.

879
00:34:00,115 --> 00:34:00,916
Okay.

880
00:34:01,075 --> 00:34:03,236
I'm going to give him money.

881
00:34:03,956 --> 00:34:04,956
Five thousand.

882
00:34:06,756 --> 00:34:07,916
Are you crazy, Mom?

883
00:34:07,996 --> 00:34:08,996
Did you just...

884
00:34:09,476 --> 00:34:10,316
You really did it?

885
00:34:10,396 --> 00:34:11,396
Look.

886
00:34:12,235 --> 00:34:13,116
Didn't you just say

887
00:34:13,196 --> 00:34:14,396
that he's a scammer?

888
00:34:14,476 --> 00:34:15,436
And you gave him

889
00:34:15,516 --> 00:34:16,796
five thousand?

890
00:34:17,796 --> 00:34:18,995
Although Tianya

891
00:34:19,075 --> 00:34:19,717
isn't like that,

892
00:34:19,797 --> 00:34:21,235
you shouldn't do this.

893
00:34:21,356 --> 00:34:21,957
Hurry up.

894
00:34:22,037 --> 00:34:23,595
Get him to transfer it back to us.

895
00:34:24,075 --> 00:34:24,676
Don't worry.

896
00:34:24,756 --> 00:34:26,316
He'll definitely transfer it back.

897
00:34:27,075 --> 00:34:28,836
We'll see who has the last laugh.

898
00:34:29,436 --> 00:34:30,796
Do you know who I am?

899
00:34:31,796 --> 00:34:33,595
A Chinese woman in Manhattan.

900
00:34:33,675 --> 00:34:34,675
Okay?

901
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:36,275
Don't worry.

902
00:34:46,235 --> 00:34:47,235
Kids.

903
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:49,155
007 and 008

904
00:34:49,235 --> 00:34:50,516
are making a joint order.

905
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,235
Let's congratulate them.

906
00:34:54,595 --> 00:34:56,595
Is five thousand yuan a lot?

907
00:34:56,755 --> 00:34:58,035
Not a lot, right?

908
00:34:58,115 --> 00:35:00,075
This is just a start, right?

909
00:35:00,155 --> 00:35:01,115
We'll get ten thousand,

910
00:35:01,195 --> 00:35:01,917
thirty, fifty,

911
00:35:01,997 --> 00:35:03,396
a hundred thousand, a million.

912
00:35:03,516 --> 00:35:05,436
Key Performance Indicators
are not dreams.

913
00:35:05,796 --> 00:35:07,075
Let's applaud for them.

914
00:35:08,436 --> 00:35:10,195
Play the music.

916
00:35:27,672 --> 00:35:29,416
Keep up the good work!

Xu Kaixin.

920
00:36:04,356 --> 00:36:05,356
Xu Kaixin.

921
00:36:05,796 --> 00:36:06,555
Why transfer Xiaomi

922
00:36:06,635 --> 00:36:07,635
to another kindergarten?

923
00:36:25,275 --> 00:36:26,275
Hello.

924
00:36:26,675 --> 00:36:27,196
Xu Kaixin.

925
00:36:27,276 --> 00:36:28,516
Why did you transfer Xiaomi...

926
00:36:53,436 --> 00:36:54,436
Ms. Xu.

927
00:36:56,275 --> 00:36:57,475
You can speak properly.

928
00:36:57,555 --> 00:36:59,036
I'm now at your doorstep.

929
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:00,595
Why transfer Xiaomi

930
00:37:00,675 --> 00:37:01,675
to another kindergarten?

931
00:37:01,876 --> 00:37:02,876
You really have the guts.

932
00:37:02,956 --> 00:37:03,916
Went to my doorstep

933
00:37:03,996 --> 00:37:04,755
to block me.

934
00:37:04,996 --> 00:37:06,236
Really got some nerve.

935
00:37:06,316 --> 00:37:07,876
I had no other choice, right?

936
00:37:07,956 --> 00:37:08,876
You won't let the kids

937
00:37:08,956 --> 00:37:09,956
see my mom.

938
00:37:10,155 --> 00:37:11,916
Please don't distort the facts first,

939
00:37:11,996 --> 00:37:12,755
alright?

940
00:37:12,836 --> 00:37:13,516
You know well

941
00:37:13,596 --> 00:37:14,876
what you've done.

942
00:37:18,396 --> 00:37:19,555
I have already apologized.

943
00:37:19,635 --> 00:37:20,876
It was my fault before.

944
00:37:20,956 --> 00:37:22,475
But no matter what,

945
00:37:22,555 --> 00:37:24,195
isn't life the most important thing now?

946
00:37:24,275 --> 00:37:25,515
When you abandoned us,

947
00:37:25,595 --> 00:37:26,635
did you ever think about

948
00:37:26,715 --> 00:37:27,515
our lives?

949
00:37:27,595 --> 00:37:28,236
Qian Hao,

950
00:37:28,316 --> 00:37:29,116
I want no argument

951
00:37:29,196 --> 00:37:30,396
about the past.

952
00:37:30,476 --> 00:37:31,796
My demand is very simple.

953
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:33,115
I already told you last time.

954
00:37:33,195 --> 00:37:34,475
If you agree

955
00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:35,317
and think it over,

956
00:37:35,397 --> 00:37:36,396
then contact me.

957
00:37:36,476 --> 00:37:37,196
If not,

958
00:37:37,276 --> 00:37:38,475
don't call me again.

959
00:37:38,555 --> 00:37:40,155
Otherwise, it is harassment.

960
00:37:40,235 --> 00:37:41,235
Bye bye.

961
00:37:43,075 --> 00:37:44,436
Let me remind you once again.

962
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,115
Stop coming to my place to find me.

963
00:37:46,195 --> 00:37:46,837
It's in vain.

964
00:37:46,917 --> 00:37:48,396
We have already moved home.

965
00:37:48,595 --> 00:37:49,595
Bye.

966
00:37:49,715 --> 00:37:50,715
I...

967
00:38:01,916 --> 00:38:03,035
Alright, now

968
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:04,035
let's talk carefully.

969
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,317
We'll write an agreement

970
00:38:05,397 --> 00:38:06,836
in my computer.

971
00:38:07,356 --> 00:38:08,236
Get serious then.

972
00:38:08,316 --> 00:38:09,316
Alright.

973
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:10,715
First of all,

974
00:38:10,836 --> 00:38:12,236
everyone has a special agreement

975
00:38:12,316 --> 00:38:13,836
of their own.

976
00:38:14,555 --> 00:38:15,595
This is also

977
00:38:15,675 --> 00:38:17,316
a bottom line that can't be compromised.

978
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:19,075
The rest we can negotiate.

979
00:38:19,436 --> 00:38:20,516
The first term.

980
00:38:20,635 --> 00:38:22,035
You know it, and you also agreed.

981
00:38:22,115 --> 00:38:23,675
- You're very clear.
- When did I agree?

982
00:38:25,155 --> 00:38:25,917
Just now.

983
00:38:25,997 --> 00:38:27,796
You forgot, you agreed.

984
00:38:27,876 --> 00:38:28,397
Forget it.

985
00:38:28,477 --> 00:38:29,515
Then, next,

986
00:38:29,595 --> 00:38:30,357
this agreement

987
00:38:30,437 --> 00:38:31,916
covers economic issues,

988
00:38:31,996 --> 00:38:33,595
emotional issues, child issues,

989
00:38:33,755 --> 00:38:34,756
and life issues.

990
00:38:34,836 --> 00:38:35,515
Four of them.

991
00:38:35,595 --> 00:38:36,316
Any questions?

992
00:38:36,396 --> 00:38:37,035
No.

993
00:38:37,115 --> 00:38:38,115
Okay.

994
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:39,155
Economic issues first.

995
00:38:39,235 --> 00:38:40,235
You go first.

996
00:38:40,876 --> 00:38:41,437
Split bills.

997
00:38:41,517 --> 00:38:42,836
But not absolutely like that.

998
00:38:43,916 --> 00:38:44,916
What do you mean?

999
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,036
Splitting too clearly

1000
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,075
easily hurts feelings.

1001
00:38:48,155 --> 00:38:49,195
Splitting not clearly

1002
00:38:49,275 --> 00:38:50,595
hurts feelings even more.

1003
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:52,235
Let's do it this way.

1004
00:38:52,436 --> 00:38:53,876
For major expenses, we pay our own.

1005
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,275
For minor expenses, let it slide.

1006
00:38:55,675 --> 00:38:56,876
For example, major expenses

1007
00:38:56,956 --> 00:38:58,155
include our respective rents,

1008
00:38:58,235 --> 00:38:59,076
children's expenses,

1009
00:38:59,156 --> 00:39:00,836
and each other's medical bills.

1010
00:39:00,916 --> 00:39:02,115
We settle these clearly.

1011
00:39:02,275 --> 00:39:03,635
Minor expenses include dining out,

1012
00:39:03,715 --> 00:39:04,756
dating, and gifts.

1013
00:39:04,836 --> 00:39:05,916
These can be ignored.

1014
00:39:05,996 --> 00:39:06,996
How about that?

1015
00:39:08,155 --> 00:39:09,155
Okay.

1016
00:39:11,316 --> 00:39:12,196
Regarding emotions,

1017
00:39:12,276 --> 00:39:13,996
I have two special requests.

1018
00:39:14,715 --> 00:39:15,715
Ladies first.

1019
00:39:15,956 --> 00:39:16,796
Firstly, I hope

1020
00:39:16,876 --> 00:39:17,716
we can clarify

1021
00:39:17,796 --> 00:39:18,717
any issues in advance.

1022
00:39:18,797 --> 00:39:20,036
Absolutely don't test.

1023
00:39:20,476 --> 00:39:22,155
For example, everyone's birthdays,

1024
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,075
including the kids

1025
00:39:23,155 --> 00:39:23,917
and relatives.

1026
00:39:23,997 --> 00:39:25,796
And some important festivals.

1027
00:39:26,075 --> 00:39:27,836
Remind each other one week in advance.

1028
00:39:27,996 --> 00:39:29,436
Just not that

1029
00:39:29,916 --> 00:39:30,717
'Would he remember?'

1030
00:39:30,797 --> 00:39:32,075
'Would he forget?'

1031
00:39:32,235 --> 00:39:33,635
Just make it clear in advance

1032
00:39:33,715 --> 00:39:34,916
for our special combination.

1033
00:39:35,075 --> 00:39:36,115
Reduce conflicts.

1034
00:39:37,356 --> 00:39:38,516
This proposition is good.

1035
00:39:38,956 --> 00:39:40,595
You brought it up for me.

1036
00:39:41,755 --> 00:39:42,755
What about the other one?

1037
00:39:43,235 --> 00:39:44,675
Both parties should

1038
00:39:44,755 --> 00:39:45,796
maintain a good figure

1039
00:39:45,876 --> 00:39:48,195
and appearance for each other.

1040
00:39:48,675 --> 00:39:50,195
Making both of us look

1041
00:39:50,316 --> 00:39:51,396
pleasing to the eye.

1042
00:39:53,555 --> 00:39:54,996
This suggestion of yours

1043
00:39:55,115 --> 00:39:56,635
shows a bit of impure intention.

1044
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:58,475
I've never denied

1045
00:39:58,555 --> 00:39:59,796
that I'm a face-judger.

1046
00:40:00,595 --> 00:40:02,115
Sure, I'll join the gym tomorrow.

1047
00:40:03,148 --> 00:40:05,944
(Xin Kang Homeland)

1048
00:40:46,275 --> 00:40:48,396
Then, regarding emotional issues,

1049
00:40:48,476 --> 00:40:49,836
do you have any requirements?

1050
00:40:52,316 --> 00:40:54,675
As for me, I do have one request.

1051
00:40:55,396 --> 00:40:56,675
It's not really a request.

1052
00:40:58,755 --> 00:40:59,796
You know, my feelings

1053
00:41:00,115 --> 00:41:01,396
for Yu'an and Yule's mom

1054
00:41:01,476 --> 00:41:02,876
are different from yours

1055
00:41:02,956 --> 00:41:04,476
for your ex-husband.

1056
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,236
I know talking about my ex

1057
00:41:07,316 --> 00:41:09,715
in front of you is not appropriate.

1058
00:41:10,115 --> 00:41:11,316
But I...

1059
00:41:11,396 --> 00:41:12,277
I mean...

1060
00:41:12,357 --> 00:41:13,595
You can still love her.

1061
00:41:15,195 --> 00:41:16,836
- You...
- I won't be angry.

1062
00:41:17,155 --> 00:41:18,316
You might not know,

1063
00:41:18,396 --> 00:41:20,275
actually, I even have a bit of

1064
00:41:20,396 --> 00:41:22,316
respect and admiration
for your relationship.

1065
00:41:23,155 --> 00:41:23,757
I'm actually

1066
00:41:23,837 --> 00:41:24,996
shipping you.

1067
00:41:25,235 --> 00:41:26,276
Both of you

1068
00:41:26,356 --> 00:41:27,316
went all the way

1069
00:41:27,396 --> 00:41:28,595
from campus into marriage.

1070
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:29,995
It's quite similar

1071
00:41:30,075 --> 00:41:30,796
to my experience.

1072
00:41:30,876 --> 00:41:31,516
But I'm just

1073
00:41:31,596 --> 00:41:32,796
a failed example.

1074
00:41:32,996 --> 00:41:33,917
This type of love

1075
00:41:33,997 --> 00:41:35,916
is the purest and cleanest.

1076
00:41:36,635 --> 00:41:38,316
But for me now,

1077
00:41:39,075 --> 00:41:40,715
I'm a little tired of loving.

1078
00:41:40,996 --> 00:41:42,876
Compared to a passionate relationship,

1079
00:41:42,996 --> 00:41:44,956
I would rather choose

1080
00:41:45,036 --> 00:41:46,275
a peaceful life.

1081
00:41:47,115 --> 00:41:48,836
But I absolutely like you.

1082
00:41:49,075 --> 00:41:50,155
I like to be with you,

1083
00:41:50,235 --> 00:41:51,396
every minute and second.

1084
00:41:52,115 --> 00:41:53,115
From my point of view,

1085
00:41:53,195 --> 00:41:55,316
80% of life in sync

1086
00:41:55,396 --> 00:41:56,996
and 20% of fondness

1087
00:41:57,316 --> 00:41:58,237
is what satisfies me

1088
00:41:58,317 --> 00:41:59,396
the most in a relationship.

1089
00:41:59,836 --> 00:42:00,635
So,

1090
00:42:00,796 --> 00:42:02,195
she's still your love.

1091
00:42:02,595 --> 00:42:03,716
Let's be each other's

1092
00:42:03,796 --> 00:42:04,876
sufficient liking.

1093
00:42:05,115 --> 00:42:06,115
Okay?

1094
00:42:08,155 --> 00:42:09,155
So now,

1095
00:42:09,316 --> 00:42:10,715
is this still a problem?

1096
00:42:11,436 --> 00:42:12,836
If it's not a problem,

1097
00:42:12,916 --> 00:42:14,436
I want to visit her with you

1098
00:42:14,516 --> 00:42:15,032
next time.

Okay.

1103
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:33,635
Next, there are two more issues,

1104
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:36,436
which are the issue with the kids,

1105
00:42:36,516 --> 00:42:37,956
and the issue with living.

1106
00:42:40,396 --> 00:42:41,635
When these four kids first met,

1107
00:42:41,715 --> 00:42:43,275
they had a big fight.

1108
00:42:43,396 --> 00:42:44,475
I feel that

1109
00:42:44,555 --> 00:42:45,515
the biggest problem

1110
00:42:45,595 --> 00:42:46,635
is them.

1111
00:42:47,555 --> 00:42:48,916
I actually think,

1112
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:50,635
we can try

1113
00:42:50,715 --> 00:42:51,715
a different direction.

1114
00:42:52,715 --> 00:42:53,715
I'm listening.

1115
00:42:54,396 --> 00:42:56,635
The person sitting in front of you now

1116
00:42:57,075 --> 00:42:59,316
is someone with a hidden identity.

1117
00:43:00,715 --> 00:43:01,796
What identity?
