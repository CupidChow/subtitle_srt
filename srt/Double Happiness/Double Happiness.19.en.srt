Bye.

19
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:43,000
Morning.

20
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:44,120
Keep going.

21
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:45,599
Good morning.

00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,359
Good morning.

Keep going.

24
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
Come on, get off.

25
00:02:05,999 --> 00:02:06,999
Hurry up.

26
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,400
Keep going.

27
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:11,679
Your backpacks.

28
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:12,001
Here.

29
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:13,479
Good morning.

30
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
Good morning.

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,960
Alright.

32
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:21,600
Go ahead.

33
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,480
Yu'an, Yule.

34
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,399
Good morning.

35
00:02:23,479 --> 00:02:24,399
Good morning.

36
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:25,239
Come with me.

37
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:27,119
Bye-bye.

38
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:28,199
Bye.

39
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:38,999
Yao.

40
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,840
Mei, what's wrong?

41
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,561
Something came up.

42
00:02:42,641 --> 00:02:43,799
I've asked for leave

43
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,879
on DingTalk.

44
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,080
If Ms. Li

45
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,320
asks about anything,

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,720
speak on my behalf.

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,560
Mei, it's the monthly meeting.

48
00:02:50,719 --> 00:02:51,400
The head office

49
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,639
will send someone over.

50
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,200
I think you should be here.

51
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:54,721
It's fine.

52
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:55,839
By the way,

53
00:02:55,919 --> 00:02:56,880
don't urge our partner

54
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,280
to pay the balance of Phase III

55
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,760
of the special project.

56
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,281
Let it be.

57
00:03:00,361 --> 00:03:01,399
Mei, I-I don't get it.

58
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,639
What do you mean?

59
00:03:02,719 --> 00:03:04,000
You don't have to understand.

60
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,079
You'll get it one day.

61
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:06,119
Alright, I have to go.

62
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,199
Okay.

63
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,760
Yao.

64
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,840
Ms. Li.

65
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,720
Tell Mei Chengyi

66
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,360
to urge Jincheng to settle

67
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,520
the payment.

68
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,600
Mei is on leave today.

69
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,719
Doesn't he know

70
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:21,160
what day it is today?

71
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,079
Tell him

72
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,159
to hurry back.

73
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,360
Call him.

74
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,520
Okay, Ms. Li.

75
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,120
Come on.

76
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:33,320
Mei, Ms. Li got mad.

77
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,119
She said

78
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,120
you had to come back

79
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,280
no matter what.

80
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:36,919
She also

81
00:03:36,999 --> 00:03:37,680
wants you to

82
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,720
contact Jincheng.

83
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,919
Don't forget it.

84
00:03:43,384 --> 00:03:44,632
(I can't be there.)

85
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:46,719
What did he say?

86
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,520
What happened?

87
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,960
He said he couldn't come here.

88
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,319
What do we do?

89
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:11,679
It's here.

90
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:12,759
Right, sir?

91
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,919
Yeah.

92
00:04:17,502 --> 00:04:20,599
(Ms. Li)

93
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:21,121
Sir,

94
00:04:21,201 --> 00:04:22,560
there are no major issues

95
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:23,480
with your car.

96
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,920
I'll call you to pick it up

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
in five working days.

98
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,599
Okay.

99
00:04:26,679 --> 00:04:27,360
Please sign here.

100
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:27,959
Take the key.

101
00:04:28,039 --> 00:04:28,599
Alright.

102
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:29,679
Okay.

103
00:04:34,679 --> 00:04:35,399
Where do I sign?

104
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:36,479
Here.

105
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,079
Okay.

106
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:39,880
Stay in touch.

107
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,599
Okay, thanks.

108
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:41,679
Bye.

109
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,121
Did anyone

110
00:05:02,201 --> 00:05:03,760
spill the beans?

111
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,280
No.

112
00:05:05,799 --> 00:05:07,279
The whole team will be laid off.

113
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:08,639
Before you finalize everything,

114
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:09,121
we

115
00:05:09,201 --> 00:05:10,559
wouldn't dare to act carelessly.

116
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,279
Mei Chengyi is acting strange.

117
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:13,760
He didn't even answer my call.

118
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:15,960
I'll say this one more time.

119
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,680
They get highly paid

120
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,920
for a good reason.

121
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,079
You must weigh the costs

122
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:21,200
against the benefits.

123
00:05:21,559 --> 00:05:23,359
Yeah, last year's revenue wasn't ideal,

124
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:25,159
but that was due to the environment.

125
00:05:25,799 --> 00:05:27,279
If you lay off the key staff,

126
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:28,680
our company

127
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,400
will become a joke in the industry.

128
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:33,479
Okay, let me take a step back.

129
00:05:33,559 --> 00:05:34,559
At least,

130
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,919
don't embezzle the bonuses.

131
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:38,599
Ms. Li.

132
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:40,321
I have no say

133
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:41,760
on the bonuses

134
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,920
as a minor employee.

135
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I suggest you

136
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,359
talk to Mr. Chen

137
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,920
about the bonuses

138
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,840
during the meeting later. Okay?

139
00:06:11,159 --> 00:06:12,159
Who is it?

140
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,360
Why are you here?

141
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,040
Well, Kaixin.

142
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,559
I came to apologize.

143
00:06:19,719 --> 00:06:21,119
About what happened...

144
00:06:21,599 --> 00:06:22,121
Well...

145
00:06:22,201 --> 00:06:23,559
Can we talk inside?

146
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:25,039
Come in.

147
00:06:29,559 --> 00:06:31,279
Kaixin, I-I came to

148
00:06:31,359 --> 00:06:31,761
sincerely

149
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:33,359
apologize to you.

150
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,560
I prepared

151
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,719
a special gift for you.

152
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:37,440
Why don't you sit here?

153
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,960
Well, the thing is,

154
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,039
I've worked hard.

155
00:06:43,119 --> 00:06:44,200
S-Stay seated.

156
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,320
Here we go.

157
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,279
Can we really watch this

158
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:38,760
without buying tickets?

159
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,840
Wonderful!

160
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,519
Hurry up. Let's go.

161
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,599
Come with me.

162
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,120
We'll be back soon.

163
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,320
Why didn't you tell me?

164
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,919
How would I know?

165
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,919
I'm so jealous of her.

166
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,640
What do you mean?

167
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,760
Nothing, Lili.

168
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:17,239
That is Mei Chengyi.

169
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,760
You've seen his photo.

170
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,440
Yeah.

171
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,200
He looked quite serious.

172
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,279
I didn't expect him to be like this.

173
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:25,640
All the dance moves.

174
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,799
Young people are really something.

175
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,799
Lili, you dance quite well.

176
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
Says who?

177
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,239
Get lost.

178
00:08:32,319 --> 00:08:33,400
Come on, Lili.

179
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,480
Dance for me.

180
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,999
You should have told me.

181
00:08:39,079 --> 00:08:39,760
This is awkward.

182
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,559
Didn't you see her expression?

183
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,919
Xu Kaixin.

184
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,959
I feel so embarrassed.

185
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,600
I brought breakfast.

186
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,280
(A Second Chance)
I have a meeting.

187
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,600
I'm leaving now.

188
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,839
You got this.

189
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
Keep it up.

190
00:09:57,406 --> 00:10:06,872
(A Second Chance)

191
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,439
Why is this VIP Song

192
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,880
acting so weird?

193
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,480
He claims to be here for Xiaoxiao.

194
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,039
But why is he bringing me breakfast?

00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
♪We are still the same♪

199
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,439
♪Accompanying a stranger♪

200
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:32,559
♪Wandering on the familiar streets♪

201
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,640
Honey, come and get the porridge.

202
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:51,999
Honey.

203
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:52,681
It's pointless

204
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:54,439
to urge me on this.

205
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:56,480
What else do you want us to do?

206
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:58,880
She refuses to get divorced.

207
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,479
Sister.

208
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,759
Don't be unreasonable.

209
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:03,839
Okay?

210
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:05,320
Your daughter is pregnant

211
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,839
with someone else's child.

212
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:08,239
Qian Hao already knows

213
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:09,759
and wants her to give birth.

214
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,040
How is that normal?

215
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,360
It's totally abnormal.

216
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,880
How can you be so naive?

217
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,159
Enough.

218
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,599
I'll talk to Qian Hao again.

219
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,240
I can't

220
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,360
guarantee how it goes.

221
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,360
Sister.

222
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,679
Don't talk about my wife that way.

223
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:30,919
How is she not taking care of Xiaojiao?

224
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,559
She took her to the hospital

225
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,839
and made her chicken soup.

226
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,159
These were your responsibilities.

227
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,319
Even if she doesn't

228
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,479
look after Xiaojiao,

229
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:41,039
it's completely justified.

230
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:44,280
After all, she is a teacher

231
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,039
with strong moral principles.

232
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,120
If she had disciplined Xiaojiao,

233
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,120
would she be in trouble right now?

234
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:51,920
My darling

235
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,880
is not going to take the blame.

236
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,640
If you complain about her again,

237
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:59,640
you won't be my sister anymore.

238
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,959
You think you're twenty?

239
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,120
What a sweet-talker,

240
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,120
calling me "darling".

241
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:20,919
You get an extra fried egg.

242
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:23,919
Two.

243
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:29,999
That was

244
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,120
a bit awkward.

245
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:33,679
I think it was alright.

246
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,039
You'll get used to it.

247
00:12:38,319 --> 00:12:39,599
Anyway, I was going to say,

248
00:12:39,679 --> 00:12:40,760
I'm sorry about

249
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,760
what happened.

250
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:47,079
I lost control.

251
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:48,759
Well...

252
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:49,440
I promise

253
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,360
it won't

254
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,520
happen again.

255
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,280
You have the right to be mad.

256
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,320
You kindly

257
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,119
offered to help me

258
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:57,640
but ended up being blamed.

259
00:12:58,079 --> 00:12:59,040
Right?

260
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,159
Given that

261
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:01,560
I'm a first-time offender,

262
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,999
please accept

263
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:04,520
my sincere apology.

264
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:17,559
We both have children.

265
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,240
I understand you.

266
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,080
But,

267
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,640
I'm still angry.

268
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,640
But I'm not

269
00:13:24,319 --> 00:13:25,319
a difficult person.

270
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,679
What is past is past.

271
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,760
Good to know.

272
00:13:29,439 --> 00:13:31,240
After what happened that day,

273
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,760
I don't think we should get

274
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:35,160
the marriage certificate.

275
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:35,641
Wait.

276
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:37,439
So you're still angry.

277
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,280
No, I'm not.

278
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:41,239
You are very serious

279
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:42,201
about marriage

280
00:13:42,281 --> 00:13:43,360
and relationships.

281
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,360
I am very pleased with that.

282
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,559
This is the premise of our relationship.

283
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,280
If we were a young couple

284
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,800
who have never been married,

285
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,360
you know,

286
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,079
we can get the paper done right now.

287
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,559
But given our current situation,

288
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,560
it's too much of a burden

289
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,959
to raise four kids

290
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,760
as one family.

291
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,720
Alright.

292
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,280
I understand.

293
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,039
I respect that.

294
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Come on.

295
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:24,559
Did I say something

296
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,360
that made you misunderstand?

297
00:14:28,319 --> 00:14:29,839
That's my fault.

298
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:31,760
Come closer.

299
00:14:32,439 --> 00:14:33,520
I'm listening.

300
00:14:36,439 --> 00:14:37,760
We're not getting

301
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:38,999
the marriage paper.

302
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:39,641
But

303
00:14:39,721 --> 00:14:41,039
we can sign a contract

304
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,839
to be family partners.

305
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,679
We won't live together.

306
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,360
Distance creates beauty.

307
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:47,520
Wait.

308
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,600
What do you mean?

309
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,240
We clock in

310
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,439
by visiting each other?

311
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,720
We can

312
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,959
live in the same building

313
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,640
on different floors.

314
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,201
Anyway,

315
00:14:56,281 --> 00:14:57,839
I rented that apartment.

316
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,280
I can move out at any time.

317
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:00,959
I can move into

318
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:02,640
your building as your neighbor.

319
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,800
If my kids get along

320
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,879
with Yu'an and Yule,

321
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,759
they can play together.

322
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,239
Otherwise, they can play

323
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:09,439
at their separate homes.

324
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,360
It's easier

325
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,440
to look after each other

326
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,520
as neighbors.

327
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,159
Nothing will change

328
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,719
for the children.

329
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:16,999
They have two more friends

330
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:18,679
and a loving uncle or auntie.

331
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,280
Nobody is going to

332
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,160
invade their territory.

333
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,919
They'll be less pressured.

334
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Wait.

335
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,040
Aren't we just neighbors then?

336
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,719
Do your neighbors kiss you

337
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,679
and provide you with emotional support?

338
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:34,079
Will your neighbor

339
00:15:34,159 --> 00:15:36,079
join you in parenting,

340
00:15:36,159 --> 00:15:37,080
and watch movies,

341
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,280
travel,

342
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,559
and sleep with you?

343
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,760
I think

344
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:44,760
we can sign a one-year contract

345
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:45,999
and see

346
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:46,681
if there is

347
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:48,280
something else we need.

348
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,320
If we don't get along well,

349
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,239
we can go back to being friends

350
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,240
without troubling

351
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,480
the Civil Affairs Bureau.

352
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,999
Our kids won't have to

353
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:56,921
suffer from

354
00:15:57,001 --> 00:15:59,159
our potential divorce.

355
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:00,280
Isn't it nice?

356
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,400
I'm such a genius.

357
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:02,480
Right?

358
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,640
You really thought it through.

359
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,560
Will you stop cherishing me

360
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,079
once I'm yours

361
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:11,479
and find some excuses

362
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,320
to get rid of me

363
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
in the second year?

364
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:15,239
This is entirely possible.

365
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:16,559
This is...

366
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,560
Why do you think me

367
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:19,879
as a femme fatale?

368
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:20,839
You said that

369
00:16:20,919 --> 00:16:21,521
men should

370
00:16:21,601 --> 00:16:23,079
learn to protect themselves.

371
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,120
How come

372
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,559
you remember that so clearly?

373
00:16:30,439 --> 00:16:31,439
You taught me well.

374
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,560
Let's meet up.

375
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,719
11:30 AM.

376
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:19,720
One Meter of Sunshine
next to the West Wharf.

377
00:17:21,438 --> 00:17:23,032
(Mr. Xia)

378
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm busy.

379
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:29,599
What did you say?

380
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,760
Say it again.

381
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:34,759
Alright then.

382
00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:35,839
I'm busy.

383
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:41,799
Awesome.

384
00:17:45,639 --> 00:17:46,960
He hung up on me?

385
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,879
Go to Qian Hao's company.

386
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,079
Yes, Mr. Xia.

387
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,080
I've written

388
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,120
everything here.

389
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:57,841
Should I

390
00:17:57,921 --> 00:17:59,119
add something?

391
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,160
(Is it tasty?)

392
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,640
What are your requirements

393
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,720
for your partner?

394
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:05,039
(Tasty, my foot.)

395
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,519
Work, age...

396
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,879
Anything is fine.

397
00:18:09,877 --> 00:18:11,480
(- Is it tasty?
- Tasty, my foot.)

398
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,760
Li Xiaoxiao.

399
00:18:26,319 --> 00:18:27,719
Why did you block me?

400
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:29,119
What's your problem?

401
00:18:30,869 --> 00:18:32,248
(A Second Chance)

402
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,120
Hello.

403
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:39,799
Knock it off.

404
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:40,879
It's me.

405
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,999
Enough is enough.

406
00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:43,240
Why

407
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,600
did you block me?

408
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:45,680
Because I wanted to.

409
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,760
Fine.

410
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,319
You can block me.

411
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,160
But why would you block a client?

412
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:50,841
I'll file

413
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:51,999
a complaint against you.

414
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,240
Do as you please.

415
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,960
What's your problem?

416
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:02,839
Buddy.

417
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,759
Is your boss lady always

418
00:19:04,839 --> 00:19:05,519
so hot-tempered?

419
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:05,999
No.

420
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:06,680
Listen.

421
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,441
We get

422
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,759
a lot of scam calls.

423
00:19:08,839 --> 00:19:10,280
Everyone would be annoyed, right?

424
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,559
Come on, let's continue.

425
00:19:11,639 --> 00:19:12,639
Do you have a car?

426
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,239
Call again and I'll

427
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:18,040
beat you so badly

428
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,440
your mom won't know who you are.

429
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:21,720
Come on, buddy.

430
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,400
Are you really a legitimate

431
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,200
marriage agency?

432
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,480
Listen. We can help you.

433
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,840
She's not like this.

434
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,920
Buddy.

435
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,239
Why bother?

436
00:19:29,319 --> 00:19:30,319
He's too gutless

437
00:19:30,399 --> 00:19:31,520
for our female clients.

438
00:19:34,319 --> 00:19:35,720
He's still our client, though.

439
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:41,799
Don't

440
00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:43,600
turn me down just yet.

441
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:45,359
Think it over.

442
00:19:45,879 --> 00:19:46,641
If it really

443
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:47,959
doesn't work,

444
00:19:48,039 --> 00:19:48,641
we can

445
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:50,839
go back to being good friends.

446
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:52,640
I really need to

447
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,520
think it over carefully.

448
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,519
I am very traditional.

449
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:57,759
If it doesn't work out,

450
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,280
then

451
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,960
I don't think we should be friends.

452
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,000
I don't think

453
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,520
it's fair for our future

454
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
partners.

455
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,881
Of course,

456
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:06,359
I can do it your way.

457
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,279
But...

458
00:20:07,359 --> 00:20:08,280
But I offered that

459
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,519
because I want to

460
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,039
be with you forever.

461
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,121
A responsible person

462
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:13,440
takes marriage seriously

463
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,081
without

464
00:20:14,161 --> 00:20:15,160
a marriage certificate.

465
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:15,401
And

466
00:20:15,481 --> 00:20:16,680
an irresponsible person

467
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,401
treats it

468
00:20:17,481 --> 00:20:18,879
like a piece of trash.

469
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,239
W-What did you say?

470
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:21,920
Say it again.

471
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:22,920
What did I say?

472
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:23,680
Which sentence?

473
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,680
Why did you

474
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,760
propose this plan?

475
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:27,319
Because I want to

476
00:20:27,399 --> 00:20:29,079
be with you forever.

477
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,999
Got a lawyer?

478
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,799
If not,

479
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:31,799
I can recommend one.

480
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:32,601
Really?

481
00:20:32,681 --> 00:20:34,160
I love what you just said.

482
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,240
My answer is yes.

483
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,319
I was afraid those men would covet you.

484
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,720
Let's sign the contract.

485
00:20:42,319 --> 00:20:44,880
Don't you find it strange
that we're signing a contract

486
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,239
for our relationship?

487
00:20:46,319 --> 00:20:47,759
What's strange about that?

488
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:48,839
Come on.

489
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,480
What if I change my mind?

490
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,760
Everyone knows

491
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,239
(Mei Chengyi)
it's the information age

492
00:20:58,319 --> 00:20:59,599
and e-commerce era.

493
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,880
As an industry-leading company,

494
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,799
Anant E-commerce Group

495
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,480
should set a good example.

496
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,119
Does anyone have

497
00:21:07,319 --> 00:21:08,319
(Mei Chengyi)
any suggestions?

498
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,680
Ms. Li, any objections?

499
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,559
Not at all.

500
00:21:19,799 --> 00:21:21,280
I completely agree with you.

501
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,079
Okay, in that case,

502
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:25,760
are you confident about

503
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:27,039
this quarter's numbers?

504
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,480
Why are you silent?

505
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,200
I suppose I am.

506
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:40,920
Since you're confident,

507
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,720
submit a plan

508
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,480
by tomorrow morning.

509
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,760
Okay.

510
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,520
Okay.

511
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,319
Let's proceed.

512
00:21:50,741 --> 00:21:51,384
(Mei Chengyi)

513
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,520
Qian Hao, come out.

514
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:01,000
We're busy.

515
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,520
Come out. I'll handle it.

516
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:03,600
I'm sorry, Mr. Li.

517
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,240
Come out.

518
00:22:04,599 --> 00:22:05,440
I'm sorry.

519
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,599
Excuse me.

520
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:09,279
What?

521
00:22:09,359 --> 00:22:10,359
Qian Hao.

522
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,519
Mr. Xia is here

523
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:12,361
to see you.

524
00:22:12,441 --> 00:22:13,879
He's in your office right now.

525
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:14,839
Be careful.

526
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,479
Don't offend him.

527
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,559
Our company's fate

528
00:22:17,639 --> 00:22:18,559
is in his hands.

529
00:22:18,639 --> 00:22:19,399
You know?

530
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:19,880
Got it.

531
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,960
Hurry up.

532
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:23,559
Mr. Li, I'm sorry.

533
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,600
Aren't you sitting in the wrong place,

534
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,680
Uncle?

535
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
Qian Hao.

536
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:54,081
I underestimated

537
00:22:54,161 --> 00:22:55,760
your temperament and courage.

538
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:57,639
It's okay.

539
00:22:58,319 --> 00:23:00,079
It's not too late yet.

540
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
Taking medicine?

541
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:13,079
How's it going?

542
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,760
Are you doing better?

543
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:18,839
Don't overthink it.

544
00:23:19,559 --> 00:23:22,119
I just happened to come across

545
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,119
your attending physician

546
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,760
in that hospital.

547
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:28,720
I know more than I'm supposed to,

548
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,200
including things I shouldn't.

549
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,480
Enough, Uncle.

550
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,239
Let's cut to the chase.

551
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:33,999
Alright?

552
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:34,921
Your time

553
00:23:35,001 --> 00:23:36,399
is quite precious.

554
00:23:38,839 --> 00:23:40,920
Qian Hao, we've been

555
00:23:42,599 --> 00:23:44,079
at odds all these years.

556
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,000
You have put up with me.

557
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,359
And I have helped you quite a bit

558
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:51,119
for Xiaojiao's sake.

559
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,440
Given that,

560
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,920
let's call it even.

561
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,359
I came today

562
00:23:56,639 --> 00:23:57,799
to talk about

563
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,960
your future with Xiaojiao,

564
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,319
and her baby

565
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,441
for whom

566
00:24:03,521 --> 00:24:05,359
you have mixed feelings.

567
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,640
So you know

568
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,759
Hu Xiaojiao's

569
00:24:08,839 --> 00:24:10,360
dirty deeds all along.

570
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,440
Right?

571
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,559
Yes.

572
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:15,081
My wife and I

573
00:24:15,161 --> 00:24:16,359
found out about it

574
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,879
and gave her a good scolding.

575
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,079
This is Xiaojiao's fault.

576
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,520
But we must be objective.

577
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,479
Mr. Xia,

578
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:28,161
you'd better

579
00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:29,279
stop pushing me.

580
00:24:29,359 --> 00:24:30,959
I have nothing to lose.

581
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,479
If I lose it one day,

582
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:33,959
you'll be in trouble

583
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:34,881
for all the rules

584
00:24:34,961 --> 00:24:36,039
you've broken.

585
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,039
Is that a threat?

586
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,200
Isn't it obvious?

587
00:24:53,879 --> 00:24:55,200
You young people

588
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,520
just can't hold your temper.

589
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:02,760
Have I turned down

590
00:25:03,639 --> 00:25:05,160
your company's inspection report

591
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,480
throughout this period?

592
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:09,319
Hasn't everything

593
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:11,200
gone smoother than ever?

594
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,119
I'm a reasonable person.

595
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:18,559
Like I said,

596
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,160
Xiaojiao made a huge mistake.

597
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,600
The lack of self-discipline

598
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,440
is a part of human nature.

599
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,161
But that

600
00:25:25,241 --> 00:25:26,680
doesn't justify

601
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,799
Xiaojiao's behavior.

602
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,559
She was wrong.

603
00:25:29,639 --> 00:25:30,320
Otherwise,

604
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,000
I wouldn't have compensated you.

605
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,240
But then again,

606
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,520
what are you going to do?

607
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:36,760
This is what

608
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,559
I've come to talk about.

609
00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:44,920
Alright, Uncle.

610
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,160
What should we do?

611
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:50,079
Get divorced.

612
00:25:50,639 --> 00:25:53,359
Otherwise, something bad
is bound to happen.

613
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
No way.

614
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,400
You are not someone

615
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,039
who can tolerate being cheated on.

616
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,399
Your resentment will keep brewing

617
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,360
if you don't do something.

618
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,279
Both of you will suffer

619
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:07,520
if you lose control.

620
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,559
And if anything bad happens,

621
00:26:09,639 --> 00:26:10,920
it won't be worth it.

622
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,000
I know you are a filial son

623
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,319
and your mother is ill.

624
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,240
If something happens to you,

625
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,399
how could she handle it?

626
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:27,560
Does Hu Xiaojiao

627
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,760
know that you're here?

628
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,720
She's a silly child.

629
00:26:31,399 --> 00:26:32,399
Otherwise,

630
00:26:32,639 --> 00:26:34,319
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

631
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,839
While there's still some affection left,

632
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,359
say goodbye peacefully.

633
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,200
I won't treat you unfairly.

634
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,960
What do you mean?

635
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,440
No matter which company

636
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,520
you work for in Jiang City,

637
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,599
I will provide you
with the greatest help

638
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,361
and support

639
00:26:58,441 --> 00:27:00,119
within my capabilities.

640
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
Besides,

641
00:27:01,879 --> 00:27:04,240
as long as your company's goods
are not too bad,

642
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,559
I will keep

643
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:07,399
giving you the green light.

644
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,880
But my mom thinks that

645
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,080
Hu Xiaojiao is carrying

646
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,160
my child.

647
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,920
I don't think she will

648
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,599
be able to accept our divorce.

649
00:27:21,839 --> 00:27:23,880
Did your ex-wife remarry?

650
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:24,960
No.

651
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,520
I heard

652
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,440
that you have a son and a daughter.

653
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,760
Yeah.

654
00:27:31,599 --> 00:27:32,599
In my opinion,

655
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,039
instead of wasting

656
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,559
your time and energy on Xiaojiao,

657
00:27:37,079 --> 00:27:39,160
you should meet your kids more often.

658
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,319
Women are soft-hearted.

659
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:42,399
You must coax them.

660
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,039
You're too young to understand

661
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,639
that the original partner is the best.

662
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,840
Only when you find the right direction

663
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,720
can you get on

664
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,120
the right path.

665
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:52,881
Uncle,

666
00:27:52,961 --> 00:27:54,399
it's not that simple.

667
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:56,600
She already has a boyfriend.

668
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,359
I can't go back to that family now.

669
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,799
Aren't they just dating?

670
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,039
They aren't married.

671
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,839
As long as you work hard,

672
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,920
you can grind an iron rod into a needle.

673
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:15,319
How about this?

674
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:17,599
Give it a try.

675
00:28:18,319 --> 00:28:21,200
Forget about the divorce for now.

676
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:25,200
What if Hu Xiaojiao won't let me?

677
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,440
I'll play the part

678
00:28:33,119 --> 00:28:34,119
of the villain.

679
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Lili.

680
00:28:44,119 --> 00:28:45,119
Lili.

681
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,319
She's probably out for groceries.

682
00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:52,360
Let me get you

683
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,440
something to drink.

684
00:28:54,639 --> 00:28:55,639
She's not here?

685
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:57,799
I bet she's out.

686
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,279
Interesting painting. You painted it?

687
00:29:09,359 --> 00:29:10,359
Here.

688
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:11,681
Thanks.

689
00:29:11,761 --> 00:29:13,039
Lili painted this.

690
00:29:13,639 --> 00:29:15,119
She is a talented woman.

691
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,560
After retirement,

692
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,959
she taught English and art

693
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:19,279
at the senior university.

694
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:19,601
Then

695
00:29:19,681 --> 00:29:20,719
my kids kept her

696
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:21,599
occupied.

697
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,680
So, she quit.

698
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,240
Why did she paint foxtail grass?

699
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:27,599
Because it's ordinary

700
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,680
and resilient?

701
00:29:29,799 --> 00:29:31,200
You think too much.

702
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,440
The kids picked those for fun.

703
00:29:33,599 --> 00:29:34,280
She painted them

704
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,559
before throwing them away.

705
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,359
I can tell

706
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,119
that Lili

707
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:42,680
is an open-minded person

708
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,160
who enjoys life.

709
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:46,519
She may know how to enjoy life,

710
00:29:46,599 --> 00:29:46,800
but

711
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,360
women of that era

712
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,161
have the spirit

713
00:29:49,241 --> 00:29:50,440
of selfless dedication

714
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,000
and high moral standards.

715
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,000
Deep down,

716
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,399
she's quite conservative.

717
00:29:54,599 --> 00:29:55,359
You see.

718
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,200
I'm just her little sister's child.

719
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,081
But she never

720
00:29:58,161 --> 00:29:59,440
got married because of me.

721
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,359
It may seem a bit silly

722
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,959
and it's not encouraged

723
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,039
in this era.

724
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,279
If your biological mother shows up,

725
00:30:07,359 --> 00:30:08,599
will you forgive her?

726
00:30:11,639 --> 00:30:12,839
Not really.

727
00:30:13,879 --> 00:30:14,879
But

728
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:16,680
I accept that not all mothers

729
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,681
love their children

730
00:30:17,761 --> 00:30:18,959
in this world

731
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,120
and not all women

732
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:20,760
can accept

733
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,119
the matter of giving birth.

734
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:24,240
I'm just unlucky enough

735
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:25,599
to have a mother

736
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,760
with a lackluster maternal instinct.

737
00:30:27,879 --> 00:30:28,760
But Lili

738
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,959
is even unluckier than me.

739
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:31,160
She stayed single

740
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,440
to take care of me.

741
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:35,360
So if one day,

742
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,880
my biological mother

743
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,080
shows up,

744
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,999
I think she should apologize

745
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:41,079
to Lili.

746
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:46,799
Yeah.

747
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,399
This old building

748
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:25,559
has no elevator.

749
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:27,799
It's exhausting.

750
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,279
What's going on?

751
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:39,359
Why are you

752
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,399
cooking for me?

753
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,599
Did you do something wrong?

754
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,160
Come here.

755
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:49,519
Why?

756
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:50,599
Come here.

757
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,480
So annoying.

758
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:56,599
What's wrong?

759
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,599
Did you do something wrong?

760
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,319
Are you crazy?

761
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,279
I bought this

762
00:32:05,359 --> 00:32:06,359
to ward off evil.

763
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,039
Give me a break.

764
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:10,160
Seriously.

765
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,519
We've been married for 40 years.

766
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,519
Have you ever

767
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:13,599
cooked for me?

768
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,520
What happened?

769
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,121
- Pigs might fly!
- Enough.

770
00:32:16,201 --> 00:32:17,400
You did something, huh?

771
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,480
I'll be done soon.

772
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,000
Get ready for dinner.

773
00:32:46,319 --> 00:32:48,239
Can I look around your kitchen?

774
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:49,319
Go ahead.

775
00:32:59,399 --> 00:33:00,399
Come on,

776
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,359
what are you doing?

777
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:04,039
Isn't it obvious?

778
00:33:04,119 --> 00:33:04,881
I'm checking

779
00:33:04,961 --> 00:33:06,599
if there's anything I can do.

780
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:07,920
I have to impress Lili.

781
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,960
That was so embarrassing this morning.

782
00:33:11,119 --> 00:33:12,559
What's so embarrassing about it?

783
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,399
You were so cool.

784
00:33:14,639 --> 00:33:15,280
You didn't

785
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,479
finish the dance, right?

786
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,039
Why don't you make it up to me?

787
00:33:18,119 --> 00:33:18,759
Be serious.

788
00:33:18,839 --> 00:33:21,000
Wait. Your shirt was unbuttoned.

789
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:22,399
Let me help you.

790
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,560
- You...
- I'll do it.

791
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,799
You'll tear it apart.

792
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,719
I'll do it. Okay?

793
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:27,520
You...

794
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,639
Enough.

795
00:33:29,879 --> 00:33:30,879
You guys...

796
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:33,959
It's not time

797
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:35,279
to leave them unbuttoned.

798
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:36,359
You may catch a cold.

799
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:39,839
Yeah.

800
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:04,839
Not bad.

801
00:34:23,999 --> 00:34:24,759
(My goddess,)

802
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:25,839
(good afternoon.)

803
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:27,081
(Good morning.)

804
00:34:27,161 --> 00:34:28,560
(Have a nice day.)

805
00:34:29,479 --> 00:34:31,240
(Good afternoon.What's your lunch?)

806
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,439
(Good night. Sweet dreams.)

807
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,080
(Honey, what are you having for lunch?)

808
00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:01,040
(Their food is not bad.)

809
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:02,399
(Let's go there one day.)

810
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:03,479
(Okay?)

811
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,498
(Honey, I bought you clothes.
Come back early.)

812
00:35:26,578 --> 00:35:28,519
(Honey, are you working overtime again?)

813
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,001
Forget it.

814
00:35:52,081 --> 00:35:53,080
T-This piglet is gone.

815
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,279
S-She's not replying.

816
00:35:54,359 --> 00:35:55,359
I'll delete her.

817
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,040
Who says she's gone?

818
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,120
Don't delete her.

819
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,560
How is she gone?

820
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,200
She didn't

821
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:03,839
delete you.

822
00:36:03,919 --> 00:36:04,560
Why is that?

823
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,481
I-It means that

824
00:36:05,561 --> 00:36:06,640
you still have a chance.

825
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,999
Good things take time.

826
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,840
Can you be

827
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,399
a bit professional?

828
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:11,759
You're too unprofessional.

829
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:12,960
You're way...

830
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
too unprofessional.

831
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,399
You made all these dishes?

832
00:36:32,999 --> 00:36:33,799
Dig in.

833
00:36:33,999 --> 00:36:34,641
Or forget it.

834
00:36:34,721 --> 00:36:35,959
No more nonsense.

835
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:49,919
This is too bad.

836
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:50,919
What are you doing?

837
00:36:50,999 --> 00:36:51,561
Throw it...

838
00:36:51,641 --> 00:36:52,999
Why are you throwing it away?

839
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:54,799
Stop wasting money.

840
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,439
Why does it matter if it's salty?

841
00:36:56,519 --> 00:36:57,839
Have some steamed buns.

842
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,080
But honestly,

843
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:04,160
you should learn to cook.

844
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,680
If I'm gone one day,

845
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,760
what will you do?

846
00:37:08,999 --> 00:37:11,120
Our son has his own family.

847
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,519
Even if you marry a younger woman,

848
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,799
will she be as good to you as I am?

849
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,519
Why are you saying that?

850
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,080
Just focus on your treatment.

851
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,439
It's the 21st century.

852
00:37:20,999 --> 00:37:22,399
There are many treatment methods.

853
00:37:23,519 --> 00:37:25,200
Why are you saying that?

854
00:37:25,799 --> 00:37:26,879
You act like emperors.

855
00:37:26,959 --> 00:37:27,999
Am I your maid?

856
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:30,080
Forget it.

857
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,440
Let me

858
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:31,720
cook something else.

859
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:35,160
You just have a sharp tongue.

860
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:36,160
You keep saying that

861
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,080
I don't do anything.

862
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,001
Think about it.

863
00:37:38,081 --> 00:37:39,799
Whatever I do is wrong.

864
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,399
And you argue with me

865
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:42,999
if I don't do anything.

866
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,040
You keep calling me

867
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,279
a hands-off boss.

868
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,959
That's all because of you.

869
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,160
You know?

870
00:37:51,999 --> 00:37:54,560
Smart women
should praise their husbands.

871
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:56,600
Both

872
00:37:56,839 --> 00:37:59,200
your EQ and IQ are worrying.

873
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:01,120
That's why you can't rest for a day.

874
00:38:02,879 --> 00:38:03,959
Unbelievable.

875
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,799
You want me to praise you?

876
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,600
Enough.

877
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,279
This is pointless.

878
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,399
I'll get you some water.

879
00:38:26,839 --> 00:38:27,839
What's wrong?

880
00:38:30,359 --> 00:38:31,359
What's wrong?

881
00:38:44,359 --> 00:38:45,399
Hu Xiaojiao, are you done?

882
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:46,279
I'm in a meeting.

883
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:46,880
Qian Hao.

884
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,640
Hurry to the hospital.

885
00:38:48,799 --> 00:38:49,481
It's your mom.

886
00:38:49,561 --> 00:38:50,640
She fainted.

887
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,600
Did you hear me?

888
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,600
Come over now.

889
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,319
Or you might

890
00:38:56,399 --> 00:38:57,319
be too late to see her

891
00:38:57,399 --> 00:38:58,279
for the last time.

892
00:38:58,359 --> 00:38:59,359
Hurry up.

893
00:39:23,999 --> 00:39:24,640
Yeah.

894
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:25,360
I know

895
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,960
you've been single for four years.

896
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,120
But you...

897
00:39:28,359 --> 00:39:30,160
you can't do it at home.

898
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,359
No, Lili, you misunderstood.

899
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,279
Chengyi wanted to do some chores

900
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:35,399
in the kitchen,

901
00:39:35,479 --> 00:39:37,279
and then there was an accident.

902
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:38,160
An accident?

903
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:39,680
You almost tore his clothes

904
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,760
apart.

905
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,959
You've been planning this all along.

906
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,359
Auntie, you know her so well.

907
00:39:50,959 --> 00:39:51,959
Mei.

908
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,799
Is it a bit weird

909
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,200
for me to call you Mei?

910
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,400
It's okay, Auntie.

911
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,439
Call me Chengyi.

912
00:39:57,519 --> 00:39:59,040
Stay seated.

913
00:39:59,959 --> 00:40:02,399
Kaixin has told me

914
00:40:02,479 --> 00:40:04,319
about your family background.

915
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:05,640
But you need to

916
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,399
give it a try in real life

917
00:40:07,479 --> 00:40:08,360
to see

918
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,080
if you two truly

919
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,600
get along, right?

920
00:40:11,959 --> 00:40:14,319
So I hope you're not so eager

921
00:40:14,399 --> 00:40:15,839
to get married...

922
00:40:15,919 --> 00:40:16,919
A-Auntie.

923
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,760
Just call me Lili

924
00:40:18,879 --> 00:40:20,399
like Kaixin does.

925
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,160
Well, Lili.

926
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:25,760
I'm afraid that

927
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,160
we're not getting married.

928
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,240
What do you mean?

929
00:40:31,439 --> 00:40:32,680
You don't want to

930
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,760
be responsible?

931
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,399
T-That's not my idea.

932
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,720
I want to be responsible.

933
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:39,319
She doesn't want to.

934
00:40:39,519 --> 00:40:40,919
She asked me to sign

935
00:40:40,999 --> 00:40:42,760
a family partnership agreement

936
00:40:42,919 --> 00:40:44,120
instead of getting married.

937
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,200
Kaixin, come with me.

938
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,600
Again?

939
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,184
(VIP Song)

940
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,399
Why am I so unlucky today?

941
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:27,080
Wang Ke.

942
00:41:27,399 --> 00:41:28,480
I found a way

943
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,359
to attract rich clients.

944
00:41:30,439 --> 00:41:32,439
(A Second Chance)
Check out this app. Take a look.

945
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:34,040
Look, this fund app

946
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:34,681
gathered

947
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:36,279
all the dating posts.

948
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:38,760
It shows people's basic information

949
00:41:38,879 --> 00:41:40,839
as well as financial status.

950
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,239
I'm a business genius.

951
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:46,160
It's like discovering a new continent.

952
00:41:46,999 --> 00:41:47,920
Listen, let's get

953
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,480
registered to attract clients.

954
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,560
You'll be in charge...

955
00:41:52,519 --> 00:41:53,720
Are you listening?

956
00:41:54,399 --> 00:41:55,399
Xiaoxiao.

957
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,760
What were you saying?

958
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:01,519
Answer the phone.

959
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,120
Xiaoxiao.

960
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,400
A client

961
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,560
has been harassing me.

962
00:42:05,919 --> 00:42:07,399
I'm putting up with it

963
00:42:07,479 --> 00:42:08,600
for our studio.

964
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,320
Which lady

965
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,480
is so blind?

966
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,560
Xiaoxiao.

967
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:13,360
What happened?

968
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,759
Which lady is so bold?

969
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:15,200
Alright.

970
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
It's okay. Good boy.

971
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:17,880
It would be fine

972
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,120
if it were a lady.

973
00:42:20,439 --> 00:42:22,160
But it's your ex-boyfriend.

974
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,240
VIP Song.

975
00:42:23,879 --> 00:42:24,601
Who?

976
00:42:24,681 --> 00:42:26,680
Your ex-boyfriend, VIP Song.

977
00:42:27,479 --> 00:42:28,479
This morning,

978
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,919
he brought me breakfast.

979
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:31,201
And he keeps

980
00:42:31,281 --> 00:42:32,839
making harassing calls.

981
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,519
Look, it's him again.

982
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:43,040
You fool.

983
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:44,279
Get over

984
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:46,319
to my studio right now.

985
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,120
Sir.

986
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:53,600
Someone picked up.

987
00:42:55,799 --> 00:42:56,799
What did he say?

988
00:42:58,479 --> 00:42:59,479
It was a woman.

989
00:42:59,799 --> 00:43:00,799
She said,

990
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,000
"You fool.

991
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:02,960
Get over

992
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,640
to my studio

993
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,720
right now."
