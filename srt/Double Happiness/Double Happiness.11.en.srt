middle-aged man.

I couldn't

Wait, if you...

21
00:01:46,621 --> 00:01:47,661
Help! Someone

22
00:01:48,021 --> 00:01:48,902
jumped into the river!

00:01:48,982 --> 00:01:50,420
Hurry, help!

24
00:01:57,021 --> 00:01:58,021
I can't swim.

25
00:01:58,261 --> 00:01:59,381
I'm afraid to go in.

26
00:01:59,981 --> 00:02:00,742
Help!

27
00:02:00,822 --> 00:02:01,901
Did anyone call the police?

28
00:02:01,981 --> 00:02:03,261
- Go down there.
- Find a pole.

29
00:02:03,341 --> 00:02:04,700
Pull him up.

30
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:08,541
Dad!

31
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:09,981
Chengyi, isn't that my dad?

32
00:02:10,341 --> 00:02:11,341
Dad?

33
00:02:11,541 --> 00:02:12,700
- Chengyi!
- Hurry up.

34
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,460
Can any of you swim?

35
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:15,341
Dad!

36
00:02:15,421 --> 00:02:16,860
Be careful.

37
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,581
Hurry up.

38
00:02:19,661 --> 00:02:20,740
What should we do?

39
00:02:24,221 --> 00:02:25,661
Someone went down.

40
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,180
He's almost there.

41
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:32,580
Chengyi!

42
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:34,100
He's coming up.

43
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:34,781
Dad!

44
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,180
Chengyi!

45
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:40,740
Luckily there's this guy.

46
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,741
You're almost there.

47
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:43,341
Hurry.

48
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,620
Hang in there.

49
00:02:45,101 --> 00:02:45,620
Almost there.

50
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,380
Hang in there.

51
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:46,981
Almost there.

52
00:02:47,061 --> 00:02:47,820
Almost there.

53
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,460
- Almost there.
- Hurry, young man.

54
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:51,101
Come on, young man.

55
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,420
Dad! Dad!

56
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:54,340
He got him.

57
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,420
Hurry, pull him up.

58
00:02:56,221 --> 00:02:57,580
- Are you okay?
- Take it easy.

59
00:02:58,101 --> 00:02:58,861
Come on.

60
00:02:58,941 --> 00:03:00,261
- Chengyi!
- Lend a hand.

61
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:01,341
Hurry up.

62
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:06,981
Be careful.

63
00:03:10,381 --> 00:03:11,900
- Hurry.
- Pull him up.

64
00:03:13,261 --> 00:03:14,580
Did anyone call an ambulance?

65
00:03:15,821 --> 00:03:16,821
Come on.

66
00:03:16,981 --> 00:03:17,981
Spit it.

67
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:19,860
Spit it. Spit the water out.

68
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,781
What did you do?

69
00:03:21,861 --> 00:03:23,381
You're a landlubber. Why did you jump?

70
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,420
I...

71
00:03:30,941 --> 00:03:33,781
I heard someone jumped into the river.

72
00:03:34,821 --> 00:03:35,780
I saw

73
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,021
that person is dressed in the same color

74
00:03:38,101 --> 00:03:39,580
as you.

75
00:03:40,221 --> 00:03:41,781
So I just jumped down

76
00:03:42,501 --> 00:03:43,781
without thinking.

77
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,540
Alright, it's fine.

78
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,261
I'm so sorry, Dad.

79
00:03:50,341 --> 00:03:51,821
- Alright.
- Sorry.

80
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:52,781
Sorry.

81
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:54,140
Sorry, Dad.

82
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:54,981
Alright.

83
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:55,861
I was wrong.

84
00:03:55,941 --> 00:03:57,381
- Alright.
- I was wrong, Dad.

85
00:03:57,501 --> 00:03:58,501
It's fine.

86
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,541
I was wrong, Dad.

87
00:04:07,661 --> 00:04:08,700
Alright.

88
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,941
It's fine.

89
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:12,180
I'm glad you're okay.

90
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,700
I'm glad you're okay.

91
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:14,781
Sorry.

92
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:17,420
Sorry, Dad.

93
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,141
Okay.

94
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,260
Alright.

95
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:20,981
I'm glad you're okay.

96
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,820
It's fine.

97
00:04:30,581 --> 00:04:32,461
It's truly good to have both a son

98
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,582
and a daughter.

99
00:04:33,662 --> 00:04:35,661
Look how lively it is.

100
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,101
By the way,

101
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,380
how's the talk going

102
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:41,860
between you and Xu Kaixin?

103
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,901
Don't mention it.

104
00:04:46,341 --> 00:04:47,860
She's changed...

105
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,702
She...

106
00:04:49,782 --> 00:04:51,740
I can't figure her out at all now.

107
00:04:52,504 --> 00:04:53,941
I now even suspect

108
00:04:54,021 --> 00:04:55,300
that the she who was with me

109
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,262
and who she is now

110
00:04:56,342 --> 00:04:57,781
are not the same person.

111
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,141
How could this be?

112
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,260
But, Qian Hao,

113
00:05:04,221 --> 00:05:05,500
when you two got divorced,

114
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:07,062
we seem

115
00:05:07,142 --> 00:05:08,940
to have gone too far.

116
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,461
But it's okay.

117
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,740
Well, Hu Xiaojiao is pregnant, right?

118
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:16,901
Make sure

119
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:18,940
not to let Hu Xiaojiao know about this.

120
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,180
It's too late.

121
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:21,821
She's already

122
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:22,901
called Hu Xiaojiao.

123
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,461
How could she do that?

124
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,740
I can't believe her.

125
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:30,461
So what will you do when you go back?

126
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,581
I'll face it bravely.

127
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,901
Don't mention it.

128
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:38,981
I'll take you home.

129
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,541
M-Make sure

130
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,180
you don't fight.

131
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:46,621
Being upset is no big deal.
If the baby she's carrying gets hurt,

132
00:05:46,701 --> 00:05:47,701
it's a big deal.

133
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,461
Hello, we're the police.

134
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:58,301
Open the door.

135
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,540
(I really regret it now.)

136
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,341
(I've truly realized)

137
00:09:10,421 --> 00:09:12,380
(what I've truly missed
over these years.)

138
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,061
(In my heart,)

139
00:09:14,181 --> 00:09:15,300
(Hu Xiaojiao's baby)

140
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,540
(can never compare)

141
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,660
(to Dami and Xiaomi.)

142
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:36,728
(Xu Kaixin, Added as a friend.)

143
00:09:36,728 --> 00:09:42,328
(Waiting for confirmation.)

144
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:45,304
Hello?

145
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,061
Hello, is this Hu Xiaojiao?
Your husband got caught with a hooker.

146
00:09:48,061 --> 00:09:49,540
Come over to handle the procedures.

147
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,540
A ghost!

148
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,740
A ghost!

149
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:17,341
A ghost!

150
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:18,940
Seriously?

151
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,781
You're the ghost.

152
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:21,140
Your whole family are ghosts.

153
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:25,900
You scared me.

154
00:10:27,701 --> 00:10:28,622
Aren't you

155
00:10:28,702 --> 00:10:30,061
staying at our son's place?

156
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,461
Why did you

157
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:32,581
come back so suddenly?

158
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:34,780
And you kneeled on the bed at midnight.

159
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:35,820
What are you doing?

160
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,580
I came back suddenly on purpose.

161
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,222
I came to see

162
00:10:38,302 --> 00:10:39,460
if you're having an affair.

163
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,860
I'm here to catch you in the act.

164
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,260
I can't believe you.

165
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,141
Is there positive stuff

166
00:10:49,221 --> 00:10:50,341
in your mind at all?

167
00:10:51,101 --> 00:10:52,101
Alright.

168
00:10:52,341 --> 00:10:52,902
It's midnight.

169
00:10:52,982 --> 00:10:53,981
I don't want to fight.

170
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:54,700
Just go.

171
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,780
I need to sleep.

172
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,740
I was joking with you.

173
00:10:58,461 --> 00:11:00,060
I have good news to tell you.

174
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,660
- Come.
- What good news?

175
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:02,541
Come here.

176
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:03,860
I'll tell you.

177
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,701
Is the secrecy

178
00:11:05,781 --> 00:11:06,820
necessary when we talk?

179
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,181
Good news should be told secretly.

180
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,260
So annoying.

181
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,260
Say it.

182
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,180
Hu Xiaojiao is pregnant.

183
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,860
Our family is going to have a grandson.

184
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:23,701
That's it?

185
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,900
Isn't this good news?

186
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,020
Alright.

187
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,260
I got it.

188
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,860
I really need to sleep.

189
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:33,740
What's with your attitude?

190
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,820
I've been busy with this.

191
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,660
I'm worried for someone
who doesn't care.

192
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,341
Our family is going to have a grandson.

193
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:41,181
Is this your attitude?

194
00:11:43,101 --> 00:11:44,460
I really don't know

195
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,301
what you're fussing about all day long.

196
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,540
You drove away our grandson

197
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,780
and granddaughter.

198
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,380
Now we have an another grandson.

199
00:11:52,821 --> 00:11:54,101
Can it definitely be good?

200
00:11:55,101 --> 00:11:56,021
Of course.

201
00:11:56,101 --> 00:11:57,022
Listen.

202
00:11:57,102 --> 00:11:58,780
With Xu Kaixin obstructing,

203
00:11:58,860 --> 00:11:59,502
Dami and Xiaomi

204
00:11:59,582 --> 00:12:00,621
won't be close to us,

205
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:02,101
nor will they live with us.

206
00:12:03,101 --> 00:12:03,742
Then why do they

207
00:12:03,822 --> 00:12:05,260
feel distant from our family?

208
00:12:06,821 --> 00:12:08,021
You're from the Qian family.

209
00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:09,860
Why are you helping outsiders?

210
00:12:10,101 --> 00:12:11,501
Yeah, I'm from the Qian family.

211
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:13,581
How come I'm helping outsiders?

212
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:15,860
Don't make me upset.

213
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:16,821
My illness

214
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:18,180
was all caused by you.

215
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,260
You know?

216
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:20,660
Our son is unfaithful.

217
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,700
Didn't you say

218
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,261
that's the gene of your Qian family?

219
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:24,701
What does it have to do with me?

220
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,900
I admit I'm unfaithful.

221
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,380
But I'm still better than our son.

222
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,540
Don't you have any idea?

223
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,502
You and your son

224
00:12:33,582 --> 00:12:34,660
thought

225
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,780
Xu Kaixin was pregnant with a girl.

226
00:12:37,101 --> 00:12:38,341
So you forced her to leave

227
00:12:38,821 --> 00:12:40,140
with the fake divorce.

228
00:12:40,341 --> 00:12:41,780
What did I say at that time?

229
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:44,540
Didn't I strongly oppose it?

230
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,301
I told our son

231
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,861
that he could have

232
00:12:47,941 --> 00:12:48,981
other women outside,

233
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:51,141
but he must
keep a principal wife at home.

234
00:12:51,221 --> 00:12:52,380
You old man.

235
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,741
Other women and principal wife?

236
00:12:53,821 --> 00:12:54,741
Listen to me.

237
00:12:54,821 --> 00:12:55,661
I'd have divorced you

238
00:12:55,741 --> 00:12:56,940
if it weren't for our son.

239
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,020
Vulgar.

240
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,260
You are vulgar.

241
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,701
At most I am

242
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,180
just flirtatious.

243
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,020
And you?

244
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,260
And you?

245
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,301
You've made him

246
00:13:07,381 --> 00:13:08,981
become a bad guy.

247
00:13:09,101 --> 00:13:11,380
You and your son
are the real bad people.

248
00:13:12,301 --> 00:13:14,101
We are bad people?

249
00:13:14,221 --> 00:13:15,740
Then I am the bad woman, right?

250
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,301
Why do you share the bed with me?

251
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,540
Get out.

252
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,381
Get out.

253
00:13:19,461 --> 00:13:20,382
Go outside.

254
00:13:20,462 --> 00:13:21,660
And stay outside.

255
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,740
Go outside.

256
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,261
I am a bad person?

257
00:13:26,341 --> 00:13:26,941
You can go.

258
00:13:27,021 --> 00:13:28,540
Go to your dance partners.

259
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:34,421
Is it here?

260
00:13:35,221 --> 00:13:36,180
A bit lower.

261
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,940
- Here?
- You stubborn old man.

262
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,260
Were you seeking death?

263
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,860
Are you a fool?

264
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:41,701
You can't swim.

265
00:13:41,781 --> 00:13:42,861
Why did you jump blindly?

266
00:13:42,941 --> 00:13:44,260
I didn't think that much.

267
00:13:44,341 --> 00:13:45,860
I was worried about your daughter.

268
00:13:46,221 --> 00:13:47,820
She's my daughter, not yours?

269
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,901
If it weren't for you,

270
00:13:48,981 --> 00:13:50,380
would she run away from home?

271
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:51,342
Speak louder

272
00:13:51,422 --> 00:13:52,700
and wake up Yu'an and Yule.

273
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,101
Then no one can sleep tonight.

274
00:13:54,181 --> 00:13:55,620
Right, keep it down.

275
00:13:56,941 --> 00:13:58,260
By the way, Chengyi.

276
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,780
It's late today.

277
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,221
The kids are already asleep.

278
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:03,740
Let's not disturb them.

279
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,941
Let them sleep here.

280
00:14:06,941 --> 00:14:08,221
Chengyi hasn't gotten changed.

281
00:14:08,301 --> 00:14:09,460
His hair is still wet.

282
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,741
Youyou, hurry up.

283
00:14:10,821 --> 00:14:12,380
Find some clothes for Chengyi.

284
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,540
Take your dad's clothes.

285
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,300
Right, wear mine.

286
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:14,941
Wear them.

287
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,221
No need for that, Mom.

288
00:14:16,301 --> 00:14:17,301
There's really no need.

289
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,501
My place isn't far.

290
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:19,832
I'll go back and get changed.

291
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,420
I've disturbed you enough.

292
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,141
I'll take them

293
00:14:22,221 --> 00:14:23,221
away with me directly.

294
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:24,421
You...

295
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,421
The kids are asleep.

296
00:14:25,501 --> 00:14:27,020
Let's not disturb them.

297
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,140
It's okay, Mom.

298
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,262
I'll take them

299
00:14:29,342 --> 00:14:30,741
to let you rest well.

300
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:31,421
Why do you

301
00:14:31,501 --> 00:14:33,020
have to take them away?

302
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:35,222
What are you doing?

303
00:14:35,302 --> 00:14:36,740
Your hair isn't dried yet.

304
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,022
Chengyi, you're tired.

305
00:14:38,102 --> 00:14:39,380
Go back and rest first.

306
00:14:39,821 --> 00:14:41,061
We can talk tomorrow.

307
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,860
Chengyi.

308
00:14:46,821 --> 00:14:48,380
Take a hot shower when you're home.

309
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,500
I'm leaving, Mom.

310
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,260
I'll see Chengyi off.

311
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,500
Go back.

312
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,380
Goodbye, Chengyi.

313
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,341
Chengyi never insisted

314
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:19,380
on taking the kids away before.

315
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:20,780
You old man.

316
00:15:20,981 --> 00:15:22,101
He took what you said

317
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:23,380
to heart.

318
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,020
Just mess it up.

319
00:15:25,181 --> 00:15:27,461
You two can go ahead and mess it up.

320
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,620
Dami.

321
00:15:54,104 --> 00:15:55,461
I want to sleep.

322
00:15:56,981 --> 00:15:59,660
But I can't fall asleep.

323
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:02,540
I need to go to school
early tomorrow morning.

324
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,221
And you have to go to kindergarten.

325
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,101
Why doesn't Dad want us?

326
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,341
It is not true.

327
00:16:17,421 --> 00:16:19,461
He wishes you'd go with him.

328
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,180
He and Grandma don't

329
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,260
want me.

330
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:25,620
Why?

331
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:27,740
Why?

332
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,501
You're a boy,

333
00:16:28,581 --> 00:16:29,581
and I am a girl.

334
00:16:30,461 --> 00:16:32,260
Every time Dad approaches me,

335
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:34,260
he keeps asking about you.

336
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:36,020
And he wants me to bring you along.

337
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:37,941
I'm young but not dumb.

338
00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:43,700
You wouldn't want to betray us

339
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,860
and go to Dad, would you?

340
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,180
Dad held me today.

341
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,140
But I want him to hold me again.

342
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,620
Give you a hug.

343
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,660
My good friend's mom and dad

344
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,821
also got divorced.

345
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:01,101
She said we kids are the most pitiful.

346
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,382
No matter

347
00:17:02,462 --> 00:17:03,701
if our parents love us or not,

348
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,542
we don't have

349
00:17:04,622 --> 00:17:06,060
the right to choose.

350
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,701
We can only love them.

351
00:17:09,861 --> 00:17:10,660
Poor little ones.

352
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:11,342
Well,

353
00:17:11,422 --> 00:17:12,740
that's the dad we got.

354
00:17:36,381 --> 00:17:39,260
Mom, hug me.

355
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:40,181
Mom, hug me.

356
00:17:40,261 --> 00:17:41,901
- Come on.
- I want to sleep with you.

357
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Naughty.

358
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,421
Be careful with your head.

359
00:18:14,316 --> 00:18:18,808
(Happy Cake Shop. No one can
shade you quite like your mom.)

360
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:33,048
(Hu Xiaojiao. Accepted)

361
00:18:40,504 --> 00:18:41,988
(Li Xiaoxiao. Why did she add you?)

362
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:42,838
(She's so shameless.)

363
00:18:42,838 --> 00:18:44,038
(She lacks common sense.)

364
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:44,958
(She has no morals.)

365
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:45,998
(I envy her complexion.)

366
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:47,640
(Why does she
have the nerve to add you?)

367
00:18:54,981 --> 00:18:55,780
(Li Xiaoxiao,)

368
00:18:55,981 --> 00:18:57,341
(if you attended primary school)

369
00:18:57,421 --> 00:18:58,581
(and paid attention,)

370
00:18:58,661 --> 00:19:00,661
(you wouldn't have
such a limited vocabulary.)

371
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:02,340
(Why did she approach you?)

372
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,302
(Probably)

373
00:19:04,382 --> 00:19:05,701
(because I called to livestream)

374
00:19:05,861 --> 00:19:07,500
(how Qian Hao disgusted me.)

375
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:11,862
(Geez.)

376
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,621
(It's too much information
for one night.)

377
00:19:13,701 --> 00:19:15,100
(Qian Hao harassed you again?)

378
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:16,180
(Yeah.)

379
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,701
(The scumbag and his mom
actually came to where I live.)

380
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,381
(By the way,)

381
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,381
(Qian Hao said Hu Xiaojiao is pregnant,)

382
00:19:21,461 --> 00:19:23,288
(and his mom wanted to leave all legacy)

383
00:19:23,384 --> 00:19:24,420
(to Hu Xiaojiao's baby,)

384
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,500
(but was stopped by him.)

385
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,221
(He said he)

386
00:19:26,301 --> 00:19:27,660
(only cares about Dami and Xiaomi)

387
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:29,540
(and has long regretted
marrying Hu Xiaojiao.)

388
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:40,141
Hello?

389
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:41,221
Hello?

390
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,020
Keep it down.

391
00:19:43,461 --> 00:19:44,261
I don't know why,

392
00:19:44,341 --> 00:19:45,381
but both the kids

393
00:19:45,461 --> 00:19:46,420
ran to my room.

394
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,461
I don't have any personal space now.

395
00:19:48,941 --> 00:19:50,100
The scumbag repents.

396
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:51,460
He's mad and wants to get

397
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,701
back together with you.

398
00:19:53,181 --> 00:19:53,822
And you let

399
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,060
Hu Xiaojiao know about this?

400
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,661
Wait a moment.

401
00:19:57,020 --> 00:19:58,300
Let me summarize.

402
00:19:58,861 --> 00:19:59,941
Hu Xiaojiao is pregnant.

403
00:20:00,381 --> 00:20:01,181
The scumbag doesn't

404
00:20:01,261 --> 00:20:02,820
want it but turns to his ex-wife.

405
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,980
Either Qian Hao is schizophrenic,

406
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,060
or

407
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:08,901
that child is not his.

408
00:20:10,701 --> 00:20:12,100
There must be something fishy.

409
00:20:12,421 --> 00:20:14,968
If Qian Hao had a conscience,
everyone would find it ridiculous.

410
00:20:15,861 --> 00:20:17,141
But you're really awesome.

411
00:20:17,221 --> 00:20:18,701
You called Hu Xiaojiao directly?

412
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:21,461
She must be furious.

413
00:20:22,661 --> 00:20:23,342
I can imagine

414
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:24,820
the way she is mad.

415
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:26,861
I was blind to it

416
00:20:26,941 --> 00:20:29,020
back then.

417
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:29,821
I actually thought

418
00:20:29,901 --> 00:20:30,582
she looked good

419
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,221
when she was mad back in college.

420
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,260
How is it?

421
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,340
Did you add her?

422
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,141
You don't even know

423
00:20:36,221 --> 00:20:37,300
how to curse.

424
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,142
Why did you

425
00:20:39,222 --> 00:20:40,701
include yourself when cursing?

426
00:20:40,981 --> 00:20:41,622
Add her?

427
00:20:41,702 --> 00:20:42,781
Why would I do that?

428
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:44,500
I want no involvement
with either of them.

429
00:20:46,181 --> 00:20:47,661
The class reunion is in a few days.

430
00:20:47,981 --> 00:20:49,060
I have a feeling

431
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,581
that even if you want

432
00:20:50,661 --> 00:20:51,781
to avoid the trash cans,

433
00:20:51,861 --> 00:20:54,101
it won't stop the trash cans

434
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:55,820
from running towards you.

435
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,102
Oh my God.

436
00:20:57,182 --> 00:20:58,220
I really can't stand

437
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,980
the way you speak.

438
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,500
Hello? Hello?

439
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,941
Hello, Xu Kaixin?

440
00:21:20,861 --> 00:21:22,701
Stop calling. My kids are asleep.

441
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,020
I'm too thrilled to sleep.

442
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,660
How about I go to yours now?

443
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,420
Let's have a toast.

444
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,541
Don't tell me it's all in the past

445
00:21:31,621 --> 00:21:32,701
and you don't care.

446
00:21:33,621 --> 00:21:35,500
The scum and the mistress
got retribution.

447
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,142
Look at you.

448
00:21:36,222 --> 00:21:37,981
You must be thrilled, right?

449
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:40,341
Don't come over, okay?

450
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:41,701
Celebrating from afar is enough.

451
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,300
I'll go to the kitchen.

452
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,300
What are you doing?

453
00:21:53,901 --> 00:21:55,381
Xu Kaixin, hurry and get something.

454
00:21:55,701 --> 00:21:56,701
Alright.

455
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,100
Oh my.

456
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,901
You're not a loyal friend.

457
00:22:13,621 --> 00:22:15,260
Meat for me and cucumber for you?

458
00:22:15,461 --> 00:22:16,820
We agreed to gain weight together.

459
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:17,981
I'm the pretty bunny

460
00:22:18,061 --> 00:22:19,861
who will jump at Mei Chengyi.

461
00:22:19,941 --> 00:22:21,780
You can be the chubby bunny.

462
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,861
I'm planning
to lose another five pounds.

463
00:22:23,941 --> 00:22:24,901
By the way,

464
00:22:24,981 --> 00:22:26,861
I found some clothes

465
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:29,221
that really suit me online today.

466
00:22:30,381 --> 00:22:32,301
Wipe your mouth now.

467
00:22:32,381 --> 00:22:33,021
When talking

468
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,500
about him, you're drooling.

469
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,780
Come on.

470
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,780
Let's toast to celebrate.

471
00:22:38,621 --> 00:22:40,060
May the mistress and the scum

472
00:22:40,421 --> 00:22:42,541
be locked together for a lifetime.

473
00:22:42,621 --> 00:22:44,781
It's best to be long-lasting.

474
00:22:44,861 --> 00:22:46,820
And they should be together forever.

475
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,700
Why do I feel

476
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,141
you're more like Qian Hao's ex,

477
00:22:50,221 --> 00:22:52,221
given how deeply you hate him?

478
00:22:54,381 --> 00:22:55,981
Li Xiaoxiao, don't drink that much.

479
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:01,421
We were so nice

480
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:03,821
to Hu Xiaojiao

481
00:23:03,901 --> 00:23:04,901
back in college.

482
00:23:05,181 --> 00:23:06,580
She offended a senior sister

483
00:23:06,861 --> 00:23:09,500
and got blocked in the classroom
and cursed.

484
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,701
We protected her like fools.

485
00:23:12,461 --> 00:23:13,142
Back then,

486
00:23:13,222 --> 00:23:14,780
who knew she was in fact a snake?

487
00:23:15,701 --> 00:23:17,141
If I had known she wanted Qian Hao,

488
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:19,100
I'd never have introduced you to her.

489
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,861
She used me as a ladder

490
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,100
and stepped on me

491
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,100
to know you.

492
00:23:28,421 --> 00:23:29,781
Then she came to you

493
00:23:29,861 --> 00:23:31,780
to hook up with Qian Hao.

494
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,020
Even without Hu Xiaojiao,

495
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,901
there would be Li Xiaojiao
or Song Xiaojiao.

496
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,700
I should be thanking her.

497
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,541
It was she who made me see clearly

498
00:23:38,621 --> 00:23:40,301
the true colors of Qian Hao's family.

499
00:23:40,381 --> 00:23:41,062
I feel

500
00:23:41,142 --> 00:23:42,460
God sent her

501
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,581
to suffer for me.

502
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:44,661
Kaixin,

503
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,300
I'm sorry to you.

504
00:23:52,661 --> 00:23:53,901
For all these years,

505
00:23:53,981 --> 00:23:56,701
I've always felt sorry to you.

506
00:24:01,381 --> 00:24:03,901
If I hadn't been such a fool,

507
00:24:03,981 --> 00:24:05,421
letting the wolf into the house,

508
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:08,901
you, Dami, Xiaomi,

509
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:10,260
and Lili

510
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:11,981
wouldn't have had

511
00:24:12,061 --> 00:24:15,421
such a hard time all these years.

512
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,421
Why do I feel

513
00:24:17,501 --> 00:24:19,780
you are becoming
more and more pretentious?

514
00:24:19,981 --> 00:24:20,940
No hard time, okay?

515
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,141
I feel after my divorce,

516
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:24,181
my life is like it's on a cheat mode.

517
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:25,341
Listen, Li Xiaoxiao.

518
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:26,101
In life,

519
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:26,941
everyone has

520
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:28,180
some downs sometimes.

521
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,660
There are those days each month

522
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,781
when you hate the world.

523
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:32,701
Even looking at money feels annoying.

524
00:24:32,861 --> 00:24:33,940
This is not 'hard'.

525
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,661
This is called a normal life.

526
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,101
And you know what?

527
00:24:37,181 --> 00:24:39,100
One must have a margin
for error in life.

528
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:40,820
Knowing Hu Xiaojiao

529
00:24:40,981 --> 00:24:41,940
was not a mistake.

530
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,500
Marrying Qian Hao and having kids

531
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,020
was the biggest mistake of my life.

532
00:24:45,221 --> 00:24:46,460
However, as for having kids,

533
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:48,020
I absolutely have no regrets.

534
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:49,141
For my life's first half,

535
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:49,981
the best gift

536
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:51,461
is Dami and Xiaomi.

537
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,500
Li Xiaoxiao?

538
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,340
Li Xiaoxiao?

539
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,141
I find that every time

540
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:01,940
when I'm serious,

541
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,020
she just has to sleep.

542
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,740
Bye-bye.

543
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,260
(When I first divorced,)

544
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,142
(so many times,)

545
00:25:16,222 --> 00:25:17,660
(I fantasized about)

546
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,861
(the scum coming back)

547
00:25:18,941 --> 00:25:20,740
(and me turning and leaving gracefully,)

548
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,861
(without looking back.)

549
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,060
(Now that fantasy has come true,)

550
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,340
(it is satisfying,)

551
00:25:25,661 --> 00:25:26,501
(yet there is)

552
00:25:26,581 --> 00:25:28,060
(some genuine sadness.)

553
00:25:28,461 --> 00:25:29,581
(After all, he was someone)

554
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,461
(I truly loved in my youth.)

555
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,382
(When the boy)

556
00:25:32,462 --> 00:25:34,701
(smiling brightly under the sun
in my memory)

557
00:25:34,861 --> 00:25:35,542
(and)

558
00:25:35,622 --> 00:25:37,341
(the vulgar middle-aged man tonight)

559
00:25:37,421 --> 00:25:38,820
(become one,)

560
00:25:39,221 --> 00:25:40,780
(I suddenly feel a moment of trance.)

561
00:25:41,141 --> 00:25:42,141
(I comforted myself)

562
00:25:42,621 --> 00:25:43,780
(that scientists say)

563
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,581
(all cells in the human body)

564
00:25:45,661 --> 00:25:48,060
(are completely replaced
every seven years.)

565
00:25:48,461 --> 00:25:50,301
(So seven years later, Qian Hao)

566
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:51,541
(is no longer)

567
00:25:51,621 --> 00:25:53,020
(the same person as in his youth.)

568
00:25:53,661 --> 00:25:54,661
(It seems this way,)

569
00:25:54,861 --> 00:25:55,980

this never happened.

Anyway, the police told me

604
00:28:12,981 --> 00:28:14,421
you didn't do it.

605
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,260
I did it.

606
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:23,221

(but a youthful impulse emerged)

635
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,060
(because of her message.)

636
00:31:22,861 --> 00:31:24,381

00:31:27,141 --> 00:31:28,661

00:31:28,861 --> 00:31:29,901
(Yet at the last moment,)

640
00:31:29,981 --> 00:31:31,221
(I'm calmly impulsive.)

641
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,621
(I don't even know)

642
00:31:34,221 --> 00:31:35,580
(when I was attracted to her.)

643
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,981
(Maybe because)

644
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,060
(there are too many rules
and too much restraint)

645
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,381
(in the adult world.)

646
00:31:40,621 --> 00:31:41,740

(is like a warrior's battle horn)

652
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,020
(and awakens them.)

653
00:31:57,621 --> 00:31:59,621
(If I don't act impulsively now,
I'll get old.)

654
00:32:00,221 --> 00:32:02,100
(It seems quite nice like this.)

655
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,341

661
00:32:50,142 --> 00:32:51,341
(and have a nice voice?)

662
00:32:51,421 --> 00:32:52,421
What are you doing?

663
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:56,661
I just took a shower
and am ready to sleep.

664
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,861
(Well, my lazy pre-sleep voice)

665
00:33:00,941 --> 00:33:01,782
(is not bad, right?)

666
00:33:01,862 --> 00:33:03,421
(I'll make you fall for me.)

667
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,340
You're ready to sleep?

668
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,101
Alright then, you go rest.

669
00:33:07,181 --> 00:33:08,740
No, just when your call came in,

670
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,901
I felt a bit awake again suddenly.

671
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:17,421
You're so sleepy
yet still being stubborn.

672
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,581
Alright, go to sleep.

673
00:33:18,661 --> 00:33:19,301
Wait.

674
00:33:19,381 --> 00:33:19,981
Let's chat for

675
00:33:20,061 --> 00:33:21,500
another minute before hanging up.

676
00:33:23,421 --> 00:33:24,421
Okay.

677
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,580
Where are you?

678
00:33:28,792 --> 00:33:29,821
Downstairs at your place.

679
00:33:29,821 --> 00:33:31,100
Downstairs at my place?

680
00:33:31,421 --> 00:33:32,984
No way. You're kidding, aren't you?

681
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,341
Yes, it's true.

682
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:36,021
I'm right where

683
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:37,260
I parked yesterday.

684
00:33:37,901 --> 00:33:38,542
If you insist,

685
00:33:38,622 --> 00:33:39,660
I might take it seriously.

686
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,100
It is true.

687
00:33:42,456 --> 00:33:43,861
Then stay there and don't move.

688
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,661
It's late at night.

689
00:33:50,741 --> 00:33:52,461
Why are you yelling?

690
00:33:52,861 --> 00:33:53,500
Lili,

691
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,180
Dami and Xiaomi are asleep in my room.

692
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:55,980
I need to go out.

693
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:56,940
Watch them for me.

694
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:57,582
It's so late.

695
00:33:57,662 --> 00:33:58,780
Where are you going?

696
00:33:58,981 --> 00:34:00,780
I'm going to discuss a collaboration.

697
00:34:00,941 --> 00:34:02,780
What collaboration?

698
00:34:03,421 --> 00:34:04,421
A heart collaboration.

699
00:34:53,821 --> 00:34:54,821
Why did you come?

700
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,100
To chat with you.

701
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,220
Why are you staring at me?

702
00:35:06,781 --> 00:35:08,060
Do I have something on my face?

703
00:35:15,261 --> 00:35:16,261
There are neighbors.

704
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:21,421
How about we go somewhere else?

705
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,180
Did you bring your ID card?

706
00:35:26,461 --> 00:35:27,821
Did you bring your ID card?

707
00:36:09,464 --> 00:36:10,461
Qian Hao,

708
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,661
let's not continue

709
00:36:11,741 --> 00:36:13,461
torturing each other like this.

710
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:16,180
If you don't want a divorce,

711
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,580
let's forget all these things

712
00:36:19,421 --> 00:36:21,421
and call it even, okay?

713
00:36:24,261 --> 00:36:24,862
I'll forget

714
00:36:24,942 --> 00:36:26,861
why you chose to be with me.

715
00:36:28,941 --> 00:36:30,781
I'll forget that you've been using me.

716
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,540
Moreover, I'll forget

717
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:35,220
the things you did tonight.

718
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:37,060
I'll have an abortion.

719
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,580
And you forget about him

720
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,341
and my night with him.

721
00:36:40,421 --> 00:36:42,220
I really didn't mean to.

722
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:44,822
You know

723
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:47,020
my feelings for you are real.

724
00:36:47,421 --> 00:36:48,540
Since college,

725
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:49,501
I've liked you.

726
00:36:49,581 --> 00:36:50,821
I've liked you for so long.

727
00:36:50,901 --> 00:36:51,980
It wasn't easy for us

728
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,461
to finally be together.

729
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,100
I will never ask you to touch me again.

730
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,540
Let's live our lives properly.

731
00:36:58,620 --> 00:37:00,861
Let's start over, okay?

732
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:02,781
Okay?

733
00:37:02,861 --> 00:37:03,782
Let's consider it

734
00:37:03,862 --> 00:37:05,060
as being even.

735
00:37:05,461 --> 00:37:06,461
Is that okay?

736
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,861
Is that okay, Qian Hao?

737
00:37:08,341 --> 00:37:09,580
Whether it's divorce

738
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,940
or starting over,

739
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:11,941
choose a path,

740
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,580
and I'll go along with you.

741
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,341
I'll go along with you.

742
00:37:15,421 --> 00:37:16,421
Is that okay?

743
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,140
But let's not continue

744
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,540
torturing each other anymore.

745
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,861
Let's stop this.

746
00:37:20,941 --> 00:37:22,261
Let's stop, Qian Hao.

747
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,861
I'm begging you.

748
00:37:23,941 --> 00:37:25,220
I'm begging you.

749
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,421
Qian Hao,

750
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,020
I'm begging you.

751
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,580
I'm begging you.

752
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,901
I'm begging you.

753
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,180
I'm begging you.

754
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,421
Is it okay, Qian Hao?

755
00:37:38,421 --> 00:37:39,421
Qian Hao.

756
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,220
I will not divorce you.

757
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:46,702
I will not

758
00:37:46,702 --> 00:37:48,421
live well with you either.

759
00:37:50,981 --> 00:37:51,662
I will watch you

760
00:37:51,742 --> 00:37:53,060
give birth to the child

761
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:56,261
and watch you all

762
00:37:56,461 --> 00:37:57,981
rot in the mud.

763
00:38:57,821 --> 00:38:58,821
Youyou,

764
00:38:59,821 --> 00:39:00,781
what are you doing?

765
00:39:00,861 --> 00:39:01,861
Why are you up?

766
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:04,220
I fear Dad will catch a cold.

767
00:39:04,381 --> 00:39:05,700
I'm making him brown sugar water.

768
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:08,660
Look at you two.

769
00:39:09,941 --> 00:39:11,660
Your dad fears you'll catch a cold.

770
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,901
He asks me
to make you some ginger soup too.

771
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,181
Oh my.

772
00:39:16,261 --> 00:39:17,901
I don't know what to say about you two.

773
00:39:18,261 --> 00:39:19,182
You love each other.

774
00:39:19,262 --> 00:39:20,301
But you still fight.

775
00:39:20,741 --> 00:39:21,741
The final reason

776
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,381
is that he doesn't speak properly

777
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,580
and you're being stubborn.

778
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:27,301
If you...

779
00:39:27,381 --> 00:39:27,941
I've decided.

780
00:39:28,021 --> 00:39:29,220
Find a good...

781
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,461
I'll go find a job tomorrow.

782
00:39:33,941 --> 00:39:34,941
Youyou,

783
00:39:35,261 --> 00:39:36,301
what did you just say?

784
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,220
I said,

785
00:39:39,261 --> 00:39:40,261
I've decided.

786
00:39:41,741 --> 00:39:43,060
I'll go find a job tomorrow.

787
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,180
Honey!

788
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:50,421
Honey!

789
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:51,540
Come out quickly.

790
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,341
- What's wrong?
- Youyou said

791
00:39:53,421 --> 00:39:55,060
she wants to find a job.

792
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,140
What? What did you say?

793
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:56,941
Youyou said

794
00:39:57,021 --> 00:39:58,861
she'll go out and find a job.

795
00:39:59,301 --> 00:39:59,940
Really?

796
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,020
Yes.

797
00:40:02,341 --> 00:40:03,341
Youyou.

798
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:05,220
Youyou,

799
00:40:05,421 --> 00:40:07,180
are you really going to find a job?

800
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,301
Really?

801
00:40:08,381 --> 00:40:09,381
Stop that.

802
00:40:09,461 --> 00:40:10,940
You act like you won the lottery.

803
00:40:11,096 --> 00:40:12,020
It's not a big deal.

804
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,901
Winning the lottery is nothing.

805
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,221
In this regard, I'm quite

806
00:40:15,301 --> 00:40:15,981
capable.

807
00:40:16,061 --> 00:40:17,140
You must work hard.

808
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,660
I can give you anything.

809
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:19,742
That's great.

810
00:40:19,822 --> 00:40:22,020

(The old me)

818
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,700
(was dismissive of this)

819
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,861
(and hid at home for too long.)

820

(I only whined)

821
00:40:44,262 --> 00:40:45,821
(about the pain caused by my family)

(but ignored)

823
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:49,301
(that they were shielding me)

824
00:40:49,381 --> 00:40:50,620
(from the storms outside.)

825
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,660
(Tonight,)

826
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,381
(I've clearly realized)

827
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,861
(that the parents who spoil me)

828
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,261

(I'm filled with unease and panic,)

(I must)

832
00:41:03,781 --> 00:41:06,180
(lift my head from the sand)

833
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,821
(and face the real world alone.)

834
00:41:54,741 --> 00:41:55,741
I suggest

835
00:41:55,821 --> 00:41:58,020
our whole family go out tomorrow

836
00:41:59,261 --> 00:42:00,980
to buy a car for Youyou.

837
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:01,662
Alright?

838
00:42:01,742 --> 00:42:03,861
Buying her a car before she earns money?

839
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:06,100
Anyway, she'll need it sooner or later.

840
00:42:06,421 --> 00:42:06,941
Looking

841
00:42:07,021 --> 00:42:08,460
for a job requires driving around.

842
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,540
I think we should buy it.

843
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,901
What kind of car do you want?

844
00:42:10,981 --> 00:42:12,824
See how your dad spoils you.

847
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,220
Right.

848
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,140
Pretty good.

849
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:48,580
Feeling uncomfortable?

850
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:50,381
How about I get you some water?

851
00:42:54,456 --> 00:42:55,608
- Here.
- Okay.

00:42:55,608 --> 00:42:56,540
