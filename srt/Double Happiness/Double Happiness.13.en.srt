Sorry.

18
00:02:03,116 --> 00:02:05,080
(Game Interface)

19
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:07,403
You're so bad at it.

20
00:02:08,083 --> 00:02:09,202
Talk is cheap.

21
00:02:09,403 --> 00:02:10,603
Your build is wrong.

22
00:02:10,683 --> 00:02:11,763

And stop stealing

27
00:02:17,043 --> 00:02:18,123
You do it.

28
00:02:18,523 --> 00:02:20,162
Show me what you've got.

29
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:23,164
Look.

30
00:02:23,244 --> 00:02:24,563
Your boots are wrong.

31
00:02:24,803 --> 00:02:25,802
Don't stand

32
00:02:25,882 --> 00:02:27,443
too close to the ADC.

33
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,162
Keep at least a Flash distance away.

34
00:02:29,363 --> 00:02:30,402
You're too squishy.

35
00:02:30,482 --> 00:02:31,482
Alright.

36
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:33,003
Don't go near him.

37
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:34,123
Impressive.

38
00:02:35,243 --> 00:02:35,923
Or you'll be

39
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:36,923
the easy target.

40
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:37,722
Attack him.

41
00:02:37,963 --> 00:02:39,082
Alright, young lady.

42
00:02:39,162 --> 00:02:39,723
Attack him.

43
00:02:39,803 --> 00:02:40,803
You play...

44
00:02:45,202 --> 00:02:46,523
Why are you here?

45
00:02:48,683 --> 00:02:49,683
Sorry.

46
00:02:50,322 --> 00:02:52,202
I'm applying for the intern position.

47
00:02:52,322 --> 00:02:53,882
My name is You You. I'm a local.

48
00:02:54,083 --> 00:02:55,802
I got my postgraduate degree

49
00:02:55,882 --> 00:02:57,202
in the UK.

50
00:02:57,403 --> 00:02:58,082
And I...

51
00:02:58,162 --> 00:02:59,162
Enough.

52
00:02:59,683 --> 00:03:00,722
You're hired.

53
00:03:00,843 --> 00:03:03,043
The internship salary is 3000 yuan.

54
00:03:03,123 --> 00:03:05,123
Start working tomorrow, alright?

55
00:03:06,963 --> 00:03:08,123
Just like that?

56
00:03:09,042 --> 00:03:10,242
Is it because

57
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:11,683
there's no competition?

58
00:03:12,403 --> 00:03:13,403
Nonsense.

59
00:03:14,283 --> 00:03:15,322
Take a look.

60
00:03:17,003 --> 00:03:18,922
See how many people are applying.

61
00:03:19,162 --> 00:03:20,602
College graduates, at least.

62
00:03:20,882 --> 00:03:21,882
Check it out.

63
00:03:22,442 --> 00:03:23,963
Plenty of postgraduates, too.

64
00:03:24,602 --> 00:03:25,402
Tell you what.

65
00:03:25,482 --> 00:03:26,164
This is popular

66
00:03:26,244 --> 00:03:28,083
among the post-00s generation.

67
00:03:30,843 --> 00:03:33,322
So what do you value about me?

68
00:03:34,602 --> 00:03:35,882
That's a good question.

69
00:03:36,762 --> 00:03:37,723
You slept here

70
00:03:37,803 --> 00:03:39,722
in the cemetery office
as if you were home.

71
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:40,604
Who could be

72
00:03:40,684 --> 00:03:41,963
bolder than you?

73
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:43,602
Besides,

74
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:44,642
you play

75
00:03:44,722 --> 00:03:46,403
just fine.

76
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:48,882
Team up with me.

77
00:03:49,243 --> 00:03:50,922
Let's see who dares to bully me.

78
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:51,963
One more round.

79
00:03:52,043 --> 00:03:54,003
But you don't know me yet.

80
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,322
I'm an introvert.

81
00:03:55,882 --> 00:03:56,922
What's that?

82
00:03:57,722 --> 00:03:58,922
I'm socially anxious.

83
00:03:59,003 --> 00:04:00,522
I have a problem communicating

84
00:04:00,602 --> 00:04:01,722
with people.

85
00:04:02,602 --> 00:04:04,482
Why does it matter?

86
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:07,162
Our clients are all lying underground.

87
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:08,363
Are you expecting

88
00:04:08,443 --> 00:04:10,123
to socialize with them?

89
00:04:11,762 --> 00:04:13,363
Alright, let's get acquainted.

90
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:15,283
I'm Hu Pei

91
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:17,402
and I'll be your mentor.

92
00:04:17,842 --> 00:04:18,842
Let's shake hands.

93
00:04:21,282 --> 00:04:22,282
Nice to meet you.

94
00:04:22,962 --> 00:04:23,524
Tell me.

95
00:04:23,604 --> 00:04:24,802
How did you win the game?

96
00:04:24,882 --> 00:04:25,603
Come on.

97
00:04:25,803 --> 00:04:27,402
How did you win the game?

98
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:31,164
Look.

99
00:04:31,244 --> 00:04:32,762
Ward the bush first.

100
00:04:33,368 --> 00:04:35,032
Stay in the backline during team fights.

101
00:04:36,642 --> 00:04:37,642
Here we go.

102
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,723
What kind of teammate you've got?

103
00:04:42,603 --> 00:04:44,082
Why didn't he join the team fight?

104
00:04:44,563 --> 00:04:46,003
Your teammate is lame.

105
00:04:47,442 --> 00:04:48,963
Hurry up. Don't you play well?

106
00:04:49,043 --> 00:04:50,202
Take him down.

107
00:04:52,202 --> 00:04:53,163
Wait for my Flash.

108
00:04:53,243 --> 00:04:54,043
W-Q combo.

109
00:04:54,123 --> 00:04:55,123
Impressive.

111
00:05:01,243 --> 00:05:03,123
No. 23, Mr. Qian Hao.

112
00:05:06,563 --> 00:05:07,563
No. 23.

113
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:41,202
Hello, I'm No. 23...

114
00:05:42,683 --> 00:05:44,282
Let the old man rest for a while.

115
00:05:44,483 --> 00:05:45,683
He's 83.

116
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,683
He's been busy all afternoon.

117
00:05:48,163 --> 00:05:48,882
In five minutes,

118
00:05:48,962 --> 00:05:49,962
I'll wake him up.

119
00:05:51,123 --> 00:05:51,763
Listen.

120
00:05:51,843 --> 00:05:53,322
I'm really grasping

121
00:05:53,402 --> 00:05:54,003
at straws.

122
00:05:54,083 --> 00:05:55,362
I'm trying everything.

123
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:57,362
Otherwise, I would have

124
00:05:57,442 --> 00:05:58,802
already asked for a refund.

125
00:05:58,882 --> 00:05:59,644
You know?

126
00:05:59,724 --> 00:06:01,043
You're obviously an amateur.

127
00:06:01,123 --> 00:06:02,003
An 83-year-old doctor

128
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:03,643
is almost a national treasure.

129
00:06:03,723 --> 00:06:05,122
He came to our hospital

130
00:06:05,202 --> 00:06:07,803
for a consultation
because of our connections.

131
00:06:17,842 --> 00:06:19,522
Let me show you a photo.

132
00:06:27,522 --> 00:06:28,522
Guess who this kid is.

133
00:06:35,642 --> 00:06:37,202
Based on your level of confidence,

134
00:06:37,282 --> 00:06:38,923
he can't be his grandson, right?

135
00:06:39,202 --> 00:06:40,202
Clever.

136
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:43,282
That's his youngest son.

137
00:06:43,402 --> 00:06:44,563
This guy in the back

138
00:06:46,842 --> 00:06:47,963
who's in his thirties

139
00:06:48,043 --> 00:06:49,043
calls the baby "Uncle".

140
00:07:07,202 --> 00:07:09,123

I'll take you for a check-up

182

00:11:00,553 --> 00:11:02,114
is a different person now.

194
00:11:02,314 --> 00:11:04,194
She's not like Mei Chengyi.

195
00:11:06,753 --> 00:11:07,753
When you're angry,

196
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:09,913
she's a "brat".

197
00:11:09,994 --> 00:11:11,834
When you're happy, she's a "sweetheart".

198
00:11:12,273 --> 00:11:13,833
You're almost seventy.

199
00:11:13,913 --> 00:11:15,834
Can you be more emotionally stable?

200
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:17,033
Besides,

201
00:11:17,153 --> 00:11:18,234
what's wrong with Chengyi?

202
00:11:18,234 --> 00:11:20,234
He's a good son-in-law.

203
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:21,953
He's been giving us money

204
00:11:22,033 --> 00:11:23,793
and doing all the heavy work

205
00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:26,314
ever since our daughter died
four years ago.

206
00:11:26,753 --> 00:11:28,393
He even stayed overnight

207
00:11:28,513 --> 00:11:30,393
when you had
the bypass surgery last year.

208
00:11:30,793 --> 00:11:31,913
What did he

209
00:11:31,994 --> 00:11:33,553
possibly do wrong?

210
00:11:35,513 --> 00:11:36,713
He's been acting strange

211
00:11:36,793 --> 00:11:37,834
since last night.

212
00:11:39,194 --> 00:11:40,234
This afternoon,

213
00:11:40,594 --> 00:11:42,194
he sent a WeChat message saying

214
00:11:42,753 --> 00:11:43,794
that he'd pick up

215
00:11:43,874 --> 00:11:44,994
the kids on his own

216
00:11:45,753 --> 00:11:47,473
and wouldn't come for dinner.

217
00:11:47,553 --> 00:11:48,553
What is that?

218
00:11:48,913 --> 00:11:49,913
The silent treatment?

219
00:11:50,513 --> 00:11:51,833
He knows that we can't live

220
00:11:51,913 --> 00:11:53,714
without Yu'an and Yule.

221
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:55,473
He's using the kids

222
00:11:55,553 --> 00:11:56,713
to manipulate us.

223
00:11:56,793 --> 00:11:57,793
You know?

224
00:12:00,474 --> 00:12:01,074
Am I

225
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,594
the only normal person here?

226
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:05,114
Youyou takes after you,

227
00:12:05,913 --> 00:12:07,154
always stirring up trouble.

228
00:12:07,234 --> 00:12:08,594
Her sister took after me.

229
00:12:31,273 --> 00:12:32,273
Hello.

230
00:12:32,513 --> 00:12:34,153
May I add you on WeChat?

231
00:12:35,474 --> 00:12:37,114
Sorry.

232
00:12:37,594 --> 00:12:39,393
You see, those are my daughters.

233
00:12:39,913 --> 00:12:40,553
I know.

234
00:12:40,633 --> 00:12:41,155
I work

235
00:12:41,235 --> 00:12:42,634
at an educational institution.

236
00:12:42,714 --> 00:12:43,713
I'm asking

237
00:12:43,793 --> 00:12:44,554
for your contact

238
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:46,433
because I noticed your children.

239
00:12:49,954 --> 00:12:51,193
Sorry about that.

240
00:12:51,273 --> 00:12:52,155
- Here.
- No problem.

241
00:12:52,235 --> 00:12:53,633
Okay, I'll scan your QR code.

242
00:12:54,194 --> 00:12:55,194
Alright.

243
00:12:55,354 --> 00:12:56,153
Thank you.

244
00:12:56,354 --> 00:12:57,034
I'll send you

245
00:12:57,114 --> 00:12:57,953
the courses

246
00:12:58,033 --> 00:12:58,635
we have.

247
00:12:58,715 --> 00:13:00,073
Excuse me.

248
00:13:00,153 --> 00:13:01,634
Let's stay in contact.

249
00:13:01,634 --> 00:13:03,064
- I have to take this.
- No problem.

250
00:13:03,064 --> 00:13:03,833
Go ahead.

251
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:04,553
Okay.

252
00:13:04,913 --> 00:13:05,673
Chengyi.

253
00:13:05,753 --> 00:13:07,514
- Ms. Li.
- You left early today?

254
00:13:07,594 --> 00:13:08,594
I'm really sorry.

255
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:10,834
It's okay. Go ahead.

256
00:13:11,194 --> 00:13:12,634
Wait, Ms. Li.

257
00:13:12,714 --> 00:13:13,673
Let me go somewhere

258
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:14,753
quieter.

259
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:16,633
Here's the thing.

260
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:17,633
I'm so sorry.

261
00:13:18,074 --> 00:13:19,634
Something happened

262
00:13:19,714 --> 00:13:20,793
at home.

263
00:13:20,994 --> 00:13:22,194
And I had to pick up my kids.

264
00:13:22,194 --> 00:13:23,313
And I changed the dressing

265
00:13:23,393 --> 00:13:24,314
on my back.

266
00:13:24,394 --> 00:13:25,553
So I left two hours

267
00:13:25,633 --> 00:13:26,354
early.

268
00:13:26,434 --> 00:13:28,153
But I've submitted the sick leave note.

269
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,235
But rest assured.

270
00:13:29,315 --> 00:13:30,953
I've finished my work.

271
00:13:31,033 --> 00:13:32,394
I've solved the problem

272
00:13:32,474 --> 00:13:34,354
of the wrong link.

273
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:35,714
Our partner has signed

274
00:13:35,794 --> 00:13:36,953
a settlement agreement.

275
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:38,593
We set up an extra

276
00:13:38,673 --> 00:13:40,153
live broadcast session.

277
00:13:40,714 --> 00:13:42,033
The sales were great.

278
00:13:42,234 --> 00:13:43,713
Despite the minor hiccup,

279
00:13:43,793 --> 00:13:45,393
the results are ideal.

280
00:13:45,553 --> 00:13:46,155
I will

281
00:13:46,235 --> 00:13:47,353
sort out the data

282
00:13:47,433 --> 00:13:48,433
and send it to you.

283
00:13:49,553 --> 00:13:51,594
Alright, you've worked hard.

284
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:53,114
Is your back okay?

285
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,153
It's nothing serious.

286
00:13:55,273 --> 00:13:56,753
Thank you for your concern, Ms. Li.

287
00:13:57,314 --> 00:13:58,754
Alright then, rest well.

288
00:13:58,834 --> 00:13:59,834
That's it.

289
00:14:00,153 --> 00:14:01,913
Alright then, bye.

290
00:14:18,954 --> 00:14:19,954
Well.

291
00:14:20,074 --> 00:14:20,594
Excuse me.

292
00:14:20,674 --> 00:14:22,274
Did you see those two girls

293
00:14:22,354 --> 00:14:23,913
playing here?

294
00:14:24,234 --> 00:14:25,155
They were just here.

295
00:14:25,235 --> 00:14:26,433
Don't know where they went.

296
00:14:26,513 --> 00:14:27,513
I didn't notice.

297
00:14:28,074 --> 00:14:29,074
Be careful.

298
00:14:37,633 --> 00:14:38,633
Yu'an, Yule.

299
00:14:44,714 --> 00:14:45,714
Yu'an.

300
00:14:47,273 --> 00:14:48,273
Yule.

301
00:14:55,114 --> 00:14:56,114
Yu'an, Yule.

302
00:15:03,594 --> 00:15:04,275
Do we have to

303
00:15:04,355 --> 00:15:05,753
be so ruthless?

304
00:15:05,874 --> 00:15:07,553
His team did make some mistakes.

305
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:08,314
But first,

306
00:15:08,394 --> 00:15:09,713
it wasn't Mei Chengyi's fault.

307
00:15:09,793 --> 00:15:10,434
Secondly,

308
00:15:10,514 --> 00:15:11,553
he took timely action

309
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:12,794
and protected the company

310
00:15:12,874 --> 00:15:14,153
from suffering any losses.

311
00:15:14,273 --> 00:15:15,954
The revenue even increased.

312
00:15:16,354 --> 00:15:17,634
Can't you HR specialists

313
00:15:17,714 --> 00:15:19,994
be nicer to the old employees?

314
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,073
How are we not nice

315
00:15:22,153 --> 00:15:23,194
to the old employees?

316
00:15:23,354 --> 00:15:24,713
The entire sector

317
00:15:24,793 --> 00:15:25,913
is in a downturn.

318
00:15:26,354 --> 00:15:27,275
Besides, you know

319
00:15:27,355 --> 00:15:28,673
the company targets

320
00:15:28,753 --> 00:15:29,953
mid-to-high-level executives

321
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:31,154
with high salaries,

322
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:31,915
waiting for them

323
00:15:31,995 --> 00:15:33,033
to make mistakes.

324
00:15:33,513 --> 00:15:34,473
What did he do?

325
00:15:34,553 --> 00:15:35,474
He gave the boss

326
00:15:35,554 --> 00:15:36,874
a reason to fire him.

327
00:15:36,954 --> 00:15:38,474
Do you think he'll be spared?

328
00:15:39,393 --> 00:15:40,035
Besides,

329
00:15:40,115 --> 00:15:41,193
to put it bluntly,

330
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,633
you are not like me.

331
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:44,713
You're also at risk.

332
00:15:44,793 --> 00:15:46,354
You don't get to protect anyone.

333
00:15:48,633 --> 00:15:50,753
Alright, I'll notify him tomorrow.

334
00:15:51,273 --> 00:15:52,314
So soon?

335
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,354
Listen.

336
00:15:55,474 --> 00:15:56,754
Can you do me a favor

337
00:15:56,834 --> 00:15:58,594
and postpone it to the end of the month?

338
00:15:59,114 --> 00:16:00,354
Mei Chengyi is about to

339
00:16:00,553 --> 00:16:01,793
celebrate his birthday.

340
00:16:02,234 --> 00:16:02,953
Let's...

341
00:16:03,033 --> 00:16:04,033
Come on.

342
00:16:04,553 --> 00:16:06,513
His wife passed away a few years ago.

343
00:16:06,594 --> 00:16:07,395
He's taking care

344
00:16:07,475 --> 00:16:08,714
of two children by himself.

345
00:16:08,834 --> 00:16:10,314
Can't we be a bit more humane

346
00:16:11,234 --> 00:16:12,155
and let him celebrate

347
00:16:12,235 --> 00:16:13,353
his birthday first?

348
00:16:13,433 --> 00:16:14,433
Okay?

349
00:16:15,153 --> 00:16:17,354
You're so kind-hearted, Ms. Li.

350
00:16:17,954 --> 00:16:18,953
Am I?

351
00:16:19,033 --> 00:16:20,034
Yet I can't protect

352
00:16:20,114 --> 00:16:21,354
someone who carries the load.

353
00:16:22,594 --> 00:16:23,994
I must warn you.

354
00:16:24,553 --> 00:16:26,153
Mei Chengyi may be highly paid.

355
00:16:26,513 --> 00:16:27,314
But he can solve

356
00:16:27,394 --> 00:16:28,834
a lot of problems for us.

357
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:30,753
You're severing

358
00:16:30,994 --> 00:16:31,915
the main artery

359
00:16:31,995 --> 00:16:33,193
of the business.

360
00:16:33,273 --> 00:16:33,915
It won't be

361
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:35,553
so easy to get him back.

362
00:16:36,033 --> 00:16:37,513
Alright, I got it.

363
00:16:38,033 --> 00:16:39,433
Are you a bit drowsy today?

364
00:16:39,513 --> 00:16:40,073
A little bit.

365
00:16:40,153 --> 00:16:41,153
That's what I think.

366
00:17:03,513 --> 00:17:04,513
Yu'an, Yule.

367
00:17:07,153 --> 00:17:08,153
Yu'an, Yule.

368
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,433
Yu'an, Yule.

369
00:17:25,034 --> 00:17:26,034
Look at you.

370
00:17:26,834 --> 00:17:28,193
No doubt, a bully at home.

371
00:17:28,993 --> 00:17:30,114
You waste your energy

372
00:17:30,953 --> 00:17:32,113
on finding faults

373
00:17:32,193 --> 00:17:33,433
with your family.

374
00:17:34,673 --> 00:17:36,314
You think Chengyi is always wrong.

375
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:38,873
You're tired when he asks us

376
00:17:38,953 --> 00:17:39,953
to look after the kids.

377
00:17:40,114 --> 00:17:41,434
But if he doesn't,

378
00:17:41,514 --> 00:17:42,195
you accuse him

379
00:17:42,275 --> 00:17:43,713
of manipulating you.

380
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:46,834
Why don't you set up a schedule

381
00:17:47,153 --> 00:17:47,834
to tell him

382
00:17:47,914 --> 00:17:49,314
when we are available?

383
00:17:50,233 --> 00:17:51,673
Back when we were young,

384
00:17:51,953 --> 00:17:53,794
no one supported us, either.

385
00:17:54,074 --> 00:17:55,274
You know very well

386
00:17:55,354 --> 00:17:57,034
how hard it is to raise two kids.

387
00:17:58,193 --> 00:17:59,393
We managed to bring up

388
00:17:59,633 --> 00:18:01,274
our kids without support.

389
00:18:01,354 --> 00:18:03,074
But we did it together.

390
00:18:03,473 --> 00:18:04,474
He's being both mom

391
00:18:04,554 --> 00:18:05,913
and dad to his kids all alone.

392
00:18:06,114 --> 00:18:07,233
And he goes to work.

393
00:18:08,314 --> 00:18:09,713
Who says he's alone?

394
00:18:10,354 --> 00:18:11,434
I saw him leaving

395
00:18:11,514 --> 00:18:12,514
with Xu

396
00:18:12,594 --> 00:18:13,794
this morning.

397
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:17,034
They moved in together.

398
00:18:17,473 --> 00:18:18,473
So soon?

399
00:18:23,034 --> 00:18:24,594
Xu is a nice girl.

400
00:18:25,594 --> 00:18:26,235
But I wonder

401
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:27,633
whether her kids

402
00:18:28,554 --> 00:18:29,554
are naughty.

403
00:18:29,993 --> 00:18:31,913
Two plus two equals four.

404
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:34,594
Things will be

405
00:18:36,993 --> 00:18:37,993
much more difficult.

406
00:18:41,354 --> 00:18:42,354
Yu'an, Yule.

407
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:45,034
Mom, Dad.

408
00:18:45,594 --> 00:18:46,514
Are they here?

409
00:18:46,594 --> 00:18:47,353
No.

410
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:48,113
Weren't they

411
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:48,795
playing

412
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,034
downstairs just now?

413
00:18:50,114 --> 00:18:51,034
I answered a call

414
00:18:51,114 --> 00:18:51,914
and they were gone.

415
00:18:51,994 --> 00:18:53,034
They weren't home.

416
00:18:54,193 --> 00:18:55,834
How could you be so careless?

417
00:18:56,633 --> 00:18:57,794
The kids might be

418
00:18:57,874 --> 00:18:59,514
taken away if you don't pay attention.

419
00:19:00,354 --> 00:19:00,995
Don't jinx it.

420
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:02,313
Nothing will happen.

421
00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:03,633
It's very safe

422
00:19:03,713 --> 00:19:04,553
in the neighborhood.

423
00:19:04,633 --> 00:19:05,593
Let's look for them.

424
00:19:05,673 --> 00:19:06,553
I'll look around.

425
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:07,633
Hurry.

426
00:19:09,074 --> 00:19:09,674
Dinner time.

427
00:19:09,754 --> 00:19:10,264
Dad.

428
00:19:10,264 --> 00:19:11,315
- You're back.
- Come here.

429
00:19:11,315 --> 00:19:12,393
You're back, sweeties.

430
00:19:12,554 --> 00:19:13,274
Where were you?

431
00:19:13,274 --> 00:19:14,234
Why ran away?

432
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:14,834
Well,

433
00:19:14,914 --> 00:19:16,674
I passed by the square

434
00:19:16,754 --> 00:19:18,274
and saw them playing there.

435
00:19:18,673 --> 00:19:19,633
So I took them

436
00:19:19,713 --> 00:19:21,274
to buy some snacks.

437
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:21,995
Why

438
00:19:22,075 --> 00:19:23,433
didn't you tell me?

439
00:19:23,834 --> 00:19:24,873
I called out to you.

440
00:19:24,953 --> 00:19:27,114
Maybe you didn't hear me.

441
00:19:28,233 --> 00:19:29,754
It was your fault.

442
00:19:29,834 --> 00:19:31,193
Why are you blaming Youyou?

443
00:19:32,193 --> 00:19:33,034
Enough.

444
00:19:33,114 --> 00:19:34,313
Everything's fine now.

445
00:19:34,393 --> 00:19:35,794
Since you're all here,

446
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:37,673
let's have dinner together.

447
00:19:38,193 --> 00:19:39,393
Come on, Yu'an, Yule.

448
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:40,834
Change your shoes.

449
00:19:41,274 --> 00:19:43,633
Come on. Let's have dinner.

450
00:19:49,074 --> 00:19:50,633
Lust dangles a sword above you.

451
00:19:50,713 --> 00:19:52,673
You've been wounded once.

452
00:19:52,953 --> 00:19:54,193
But you don't learn.

453
00:19:54,354 --> 00:19:55,713
You're even dating someone

454
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:57,313
more handsome than Qian Hao.

455
00:19:57,393 --> 00:19:58,393
So untrustworthy.

456
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:00,153
Well,

457
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:00,995
Li Xiaoxiao

458
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,314
forced me to see him.

459
00:20:03,193 --> 00:20:04,193
Do you have any shame?

460
00:20:04,354 --> 00:20:05,754
I asked you for a favor.

461
00:20:05,834 --> 00:20:06,633
But you decided

462
00:20:06,713 --> 00:20:07,634
to start dating him.

463
00:20:07,714 --> 00:20:09,114
It's not like that, Lili.

464
00:20:09,393 --> 00:20:10,393
I raised her.

465
00:20:10,473 --> 00:20:11,873
I know what she's like.

466
00:20:11,953 --> 00:20:13,234
She has offered snacks

467
00:20:13,314 --> 00:20:14,035
to pretty boys

468
00:20:14,115 --> 00:20:16,354
back at the kindergarten.

469
00:20:16,874 --> 00:20:17,913
People don't change.

470
00:20:18,953 --> 00:20:20,274
I have done that?

471
00:20:20,633 --> 00:20:21,713
What does it prove?

472
00:20:21,874 --> 00:20:22,795
It proves that I have

473
00:20:22,875 --> 00:20:24,274
great aesthetics.

474
00:20:25,193 --> 00:20:26,274
Knock it...

475
00:20:31,393 --> 00:20:32,073
Xu Kaixin.

476
00:20:32,153 --> 00:20:32,795
Look what you

477
00:20:32,875 --> 00:20:34,034
made her say.

478
00:20:34,514 --> 00:20:35,593
Stop eavesdropping.

479
00:20:35,673 --> 00:20:37,353
I'm reading a picture book to Xiaomi.

480
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:40,056
(Andersen's fairy tales)
Come on. You're holding it upside down.

481
00:20:40,184 --> 00:20:40,952
Do your homework.

482
00:20:44,794 --> 00:20:45,794
We shouldn't

483
00:20:45,874 --> 00:20:46,833
judge people

484
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:47,593
by their looks.

485
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:48,754
The three of us

486
00:20:48,834 --> 00:20:49,994
are good-looking.

487
00:20:50,074 --> 00:20:51,233
Which one of us is good?

488
00:20:51,673 --> 00:20:53,274
I mean, which one of us isn't good?

489
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:55,874
Lili,

490
00:20:55,954 --> 00:20:57,194
I don't really get it,

491
00:20:57,274 --> 00:20:59,193
but I think she has a point.

492
00:21:06,074 --> 00:21:06,874
Dami.

493
00:21:07,074 --> 00:21:09,593
Are we going to have a new dad?

494
00:21:09,673 --> 00:21:10,354
Wrong.

495
00:21:10,473 --> 00:21:11,514
A dad is a dad,

496
00:21:11,594 --> 00:21:12,594
and an uncle is an uncle.

497
00:21:12,794 --> 00:21:14,553
It's like, our stepmom

498
00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:16,354
is an aunt and not our mom.

499
00:21:17,393 --> 00:21:18,714
We only want Uncle

500
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:19,913
to be nice to our mom.

501
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:23,114
Does he also have kids?

502
00:21:23,594 --> 00:21:24,594
I think so.

503
00:21:24,754 --> 00:21:25,993
And there are two of them.

504
00:21:26,673 --> 00:21:27,674
Then we have

505
00:21:27,754 --> 00:21:30,353
two more friends to play with.

506
00:21:30,433 --> 00:21:31,114
You little brat.

507
00:21:31,194 --> 00:21:32,593
All you care about is play.

508
00:21:32,673 --> 00:21:33,714
I'm such a smart girl.

509
00:21:33,794 --> 00:21:34,475
Why do I have

510
00:21:34,555 --> 00:21:35,673
such a dumb brother?

511
00:22:02,274 --> 00:22:03,314
Mom.

512
00:22:04,034 --> 00:22:05,114
You threw up again?

513
00:22:07,473 --> 00:22:08,674
I don't know why.

514
00:22:08,754 --> 00:22:10,754
But I always get nauseous half an hour

515
00:22:10,953 --> 00:22:11,953
after the medicine.

516
00:22:12,673 --> 00:22:13,353
It's so dirty.

517
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:14,153
I'll clean it up.

518
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:14,994
I'll do it.

519
00:22:15,074 --> 00:22:16,074
I'll do it.

520
00:22:16,754 --> 00:22:17,754
Sit over there.

521
00:22:19,274 --> 00:22:19,913
Seriously.

522
00:22:19,993 --> 00:22:20,993
Come on.

523
00:22:23,074 --> 00:22:25,754
If it weren't for my grandchild,

524
00:22:26,354 --> 00:22:27,035
life would be

525
00:22:27,115 --> 00:22:28,473
so pointless for me.

526
00:22:29,193 --> 00:22:30,274
Don't say that.

527
00:22:33,034 --> 00:22:34,034
How about this?

528
00:22:35,274 --> 00:22:36,274
I'll ask

529
00:22:36,354 --> 00:22:38,074
Xu Kaixin to send the kids over

530
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:39,393
for the weekend.

531
00:22:39,473 --> 00:22:40,953
We can go out for fun.

532
00:22:41,114 --> 00:22:42,393
Will she agree?

533
00:22:43,393 --> 00:22:44,873
Yeah, she has a sharp tongue

534
00:22:44,953 --> 00:22:46,153
but a soft heart.

535
00:22:51,393 --> 00:22:52,275
You two are showing

536
00:22:52,355 --> 00:22:53,554
deep affection again?

537
00:22:53,913 --> 00:22:55,113
Xiaojiao, you're back.

538
00:22:55,193 --> 00:22:56,994
Come on, dinner is ready.

539
00:22:57,074 --> 00:22:58,393
Come and eat.

540
00:22:58,473 --> 00:22:59,993
Don't always get takeout.

541
00:23:00,314 --> 00:23:00,995
No need, Mom.

542
00:23:01,075 --> 00:23:02,073
I've had dinner.

543
00:23:02,153 --> 00:23:03,153
Another day.

544
00:23:05,193 --> 00:23:06,754
- Xiaojiao.
- I won't disturb you.

545
00:23:06,834 --> 00:23:07,393
Xiaojiao.

546
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:08,314
By the way, Mom.

547
00:23:08,473 --> 00:23:10,593
Thank you for staying
and taking care of me.

548
00:23:10,673 --> 00:23:11,235
But

549
00:23:11,315 --> 00:23:12,474
I haven't been sleeping well.

550
00:23:12,554 --> 00:23:13,913
I can't rest well with someone

551
00:23:14,274 --> 00:23:15,035
around me.

552
00:23:15,115 --> 00:23:16,673
It's not good for your grandchild.

553
00:23:17,433 --> 00:23:18,593
Please get your son

554
00:23:18,673 --> 00:23:19,794
to sleep on the sofa

555
00:23:20,554 --> 00:23:22,754
or in the second bedroom.

556
00:23:23,673 --> 00:23:24,673
Thank you, Mom.

557
00:23:27,594 --> 00:23:28,594
Son.

558
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:30,193
Don't be mad.

559
00:23:30,673 --> 00:23:31,554
She's still mad

560
00:23:31,634 --> 00:23:32,954
because of what you did.

561
00:23:33,034 --> 00:23:34,754
She will get over it soon.

562
00:23:36,193 --> 00:23:37,473
It's okay.

563
00:23:39,473 --> 00:23:40,314
Why did you get

564
00:23:40,394 --> 00:23:41,393
so much medicine?

565
00:23:41,473 --> 00:23:42,473
Don't worry.

566
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:44,234
I got some Traditional Chinese Medicine

567
00:23:44,314 --> 00:23:45,554
because I don't sleep well.

568
00:23:45,794 --> 00:23:47,114
I'm okay.

569
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:00,274
At least let us meet him

570
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:03,034
if you really like him.

571
00:24:03,993 --> 00:24:04,715
Right?

572
00:24:04,795 --> 00:24:07,554
We need to learn everything
about his parents

573
00:24:08,354 --> 00:24:09,553
and kids.

574
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:10,633
Right?

575
00:24:11,274 --> 00:24:12,794
- Come on.
- Here.

576
00:24:13,114 --> 00:24:14,113
You said the same thing

577
00:24:14,193 --> 00:24:15,074
about Qian Hao.

578
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:16,673
You learned everything about him

579
00:24:16,794 --> 00:24:18,353
and even praised his parents

580
00:24:18,433 --> 00:24:19,754
for being educated.

581
00:24:19,874 --> 00:24:21,554
A doctor and an accountant.

582
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:22,795
How did it turn out?

583
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:24,433
Practice makes perfect.

584
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,354
I can't always be wrong.

585
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:29,354
Lili, I really

586
00:24:29,514 --> 00:24:30,713
want to side with you.

587
00:24:30,794 --> 00:24:32,553
But you are too kind

588
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:34,274
and too easily deceived.

589
00:24:35,314 --> 00:24:35,914
Rest assured.

590
00:24:35,994 --> 00:24:37,353
I'll bring him home to see you.

591
00:24:37,433 --> 00:24:38,154
I won't date him

592
00:24:38,234 --> 00:24:39,354
if you don't like him.

593
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:41,314
Kids, dinner is ready.

594
00:24:41,433 --> 00:24:42,514
- Coming.
- Dami, Xiaomi.

595
00:24:42,594 --> 00:24:43,754
- Come on.
- Dumplings.

596
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:44,696
Dumplings.

597
00:24:44,696 --> 00:24:45,592
- Come on.
- Dumplings.

598
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:46,554
Hurry.

599
00:24:47,314 --> 00:24:48,313
Come on, sit here.

600
00:24:48,393 --> 00:24:49,393
Dig in.

601
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:50,633
Washed your hands?

602
00:24:59,913 --> 00:25:00,713
Lili.

603
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,474
The fennel stuffing is amazing.

604
00:25:02,554 --> 00:25:05,193
It tastes much better than my mom's.

605
00:25:05,354 --> 00:25:06,313
Leave some for me.

606
00:25:06,393 --> 00:25:07,993
I'll pan-fry them tomorrow.

607
00:25:08,554 --> 00:25:09,554
Tomorrow?

608
00:25:09,993 --> 00:25:10,675
Why?

609
00:25:10,755 --> 00:25:12,074
You're staying here tonight?

610
00:25:12,314 --> 00:25:12,995
Did your parents

611
00:25:13,075 --> 00:25:14,153
kick you out again?

612
00:25:14,834 --> 00:25:15,834
Come on.

613
00:25:15,953 --> 00:25:17,073
They went to Yunnan

614
00:25:17,153 --> 00:25:18,554
for a trip.

615
00:25:19,233 --> 00:25:21,193
They said, "Out of sight, out of mind."

616
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:22,553
So I'll starve

617
00:25:22,633 --> 00:25:23,474
for a week.

618
00:25:23,554 --> 00:25:24,235
I will come here

619
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:25,393
to freeload.

620
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:30,633
Why did you stop?

621
00:25:31,153 --> 00:25:32,153
You ate so little.

622
00:25:33,153 --> 00:25:33,715
I'm going to

623
00:25:33,795 --> 00:25:35,313
the alumni reunion soon.

624
00:25:35,393 --> 00:25:35,955
I found

625
00:25:36,035 --> 00:25:37,594
a dress from my university days.

626
00:25:37,913 --> 00:25:39,473
I'm trying to lose some weight

627
00:25:39,633 --> 00:25:41,034
to fit into it.

628
00:25:42,633 --> 00:25:43,714
I'm going to run

629
00:25:43,794 --> 00:25:45,354
five kilometers after dinner.

630
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:46,553
Oh no.

631
00:25:46,633 --> 00:25:48,034
The dumplings made me forget

632
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:49,794
about the alumni reunion.

633
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:51,633
Let's run together.

634
00:25:51,713 --> 00:25:52,713
I'm done.

635
00:25:53,034 --> 00:25:53,994
I'll stop eating.

636
00:25:54,074 --> 00:25:55,234
Forget about it.

637
00:25:55,314 --> 00:25:56,594
Please wash the dishes.

638
00:25:59,314 --> 00:26:00,554
It's really good.

639
00:26:01,554 --> 00:26:02,874
I'll trust you kids

640
00:26:03,034 --> 00:26:04,153
to clean this up.

641
00:26:06,074 --> 00:26:07,553
Yu'an, open your mouth.

642
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:08,434
Come on, Yule,

643
00:26:08,514 --> 00:26:10,034
- Good girl.
- Have some meat.

644
00:26:10,114 --> 00:26:10,833
Good girl.

645
00:26:10,913 --> 00:26:11,593
Good girl.

646
00:26:11,673 --> 00:26:12,673
You like it?

647
00:26:12,754 --> 00:26:14,354
Let me get you another piece.

648
00:26:14,554 --> 00:26:15,993
Mom, Dad.

649
00:26:16,554 --> 00:26:17,674
They're big girls now.

650
00:26:17,754 --> 00:26:19,274
Let them eat by themselves.

651
00:26:20,314 --> 00:26:21,913
No matter what,

652
00:26:21,993 --> 00:26:23,353
they're still our sweethearts.

653
00:26:23,433 --> 00:26:25,554
Come on, have some meat.

654
00:26:26,193 --> 00:26:26,993
Eat it.

655
00:26:27,074 --> 00:26:28,074
Okay.

656
00:26:29,114 --> 00:26:30,073
Grandpa.

657
00:26:30,153 --> 00:26:31,234
This is not right.

658
00:26:31,314 --> 00:26:32,953
We can eat by ourselves now.

659
00:26:33,193 --> 00:26:34,193
Yeah.

660
00:26:35,233 --> 00:26:36,554
You naughty girls.

661
00:26:36,953 --> 00:26:38,393
You won't eat

662
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:39,674
even if we chase after you.

663
00:26:39,754 --> 00:26:40,714
But you're being good

664
00:26:40,794 --> 00:26:41,874
in front of your dad?

665
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:49,233
Chengyi,

666
00:26:50,153 --> 00:26:51,234
what happened today

667
00:26:51,314 --> 00:26:53,433
was a serious matter.

668
00:26:53,953 --> 00:26:55,073
It is necessary to hold

669
00:26:55,153 --> 00:26:56,153
a family meeting.

670
00:26:56,713 --> 00:26:58,554
Stop talking and just eat.

671
00:26:58,913 --> 00:26:59,913
It's okay, Mom.

672
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:00,993
Dad.

673
00:27:02,114 --> 00:27:04,153
I know that I've been

674
00:27:05,114 --> 00:27:06,794
too dependent on you.

675
00:27:07,514 --> 00:27:08,553
It's hard for you

676
00:27:08,633 --> 00:27:09,874
to look after the kids.

677
00:27:10,314 --> 00:27:11,393
So, from now on,

678
00:27:11,473 --> 00:27:13,274
I'll try to spend more time with them.

679
00:27:13,354 --> 00:27:13,954
Or I will

680
00:27:14,034 --> 00:27:14,953
hire someone

681
00:27:15,034 --> 00:27:16,434
to take them to school and back

682
00:27:16,514 --> 00:27:17,913
so you can relax a bit.

683
00:27:17,993 --> 00:27:18,993
Alright, Dad?

684
00:27:19,274 --> 00:27:20,274
Chengyi.

685
00:27:20,354 --> 00:27:21,754
That's not what he means.

686
00:27:22,393 --> 00:27:24,794
He won't be at ease if you let others

687
00:27:25,153 --> 00:27:26,633
take care of Yu'an and Yule.

688
00:27:27,153 --> 00:27:29,034
He's happy to look after them

689
00:27:29,393 --> 00:27:30,554
even if he's tired.

690
00:27:33,473 --> 00:27:34,473
Alright.

691
00:27:35,754 --> 00:27:37,554
Chengyi is right.

692
00:27:38,554 --> 00:27:39,394
From now on,

693
00:27:39,474 --> 00:27:40,993
don't even come on weekends...

694
00:27:42,713 --> 00:27:43,754
Doesn't anyone

695
00:27:43,834 --> 00:27:44,794
care about

696
00:27:44,874 --> 00:27:46,633
my job search?

697
00:27:48,993 --> 00:27:50,593
Finding a job isn't that easy.

698
00:27:50,673 --> 00:27:51,553
It's only been a day.

699
00:27:51,633 --> 00:27:52,993
It's normal not to find one.

700
00:27:53,114 --> 00:27:53,795
Exactly.

701
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:55,074
Your mom is right.

702
00:27:55,433 --> 00:27:57,834
It's normal to fail a few times.

703
00:27:58,433 --> 00:27:59,794
Just take your time.

704
00:27:59,953 --> 00:28:01,393
Who said I failed?

705
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:08,153
You found a job?

706
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:10,794
I'll go to work tomorrow.

707
00:28:12,153 --> 00:28:13,193
Auntie, you're awesome.

708
00:28:15,713 --> 00:28:16,713
What company?

709
00:28:18,193 --> 00:28:20,794
It's a large state-owned enterprise.

710
00:28:23,633 --> 00:28:24,633
Xiaomi.

711
00:28:25,193 --> 00:28:26,488
A large state-owned enterprise?

712
00:28:27,514 --> 00:28:28,435
Simply put,

713
00:28:28,515 --> 00:28:30,354
I'm in management.

714
00:28:31,153 --> 00:28:32,594
You are?

715
00:28:36,153 --> 00:28:37,153
What kind of company?

716
00:28:38,554 --> 00:28:39,554
It's confidential.

717
00:28:39,794 --> 00:28:41,554
Let me finish my internship.

718
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:43,834
Anyway, it's a decent job.

719
00:28:44,074 --> 00:28:45,074
It's a big company

720
00:28:45,713 --> 00:28:46,993
with over 1000 people under me.

721
00:28:47,874 --> 00:28:50,233
- Really?
- A thousand people?

722
00:28:51,794 --> 00:28:53,554
Well done, sweetie.

723
00:28:54,393 --> 00:28:55,393
Honey.

724
00:28:55,554 --> 00:28:57,473
Bring me that good liquor.

725
00:28:57,754 --> 00:28:59,474
Open it up to celebrate for her.

726
00:28:59,554 --> 00:29:00,194
Alright.

727
00:29:00,274 --> 00:29:01,274
Mom.

728
00:29:01,433 --> 00:29:01,954
I'll get it.

729
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:03,473
- Alright.
- Well done.

730
00:29:03,953 --> 00:29:05,034
Sweetie, that's awesome.

731
00:29:05,114 --> 00:29:06,114
Youyou,

732
00:29:06,233 --> 00:29:07,794
I don't have high expectations.

733
00:29:07,953 --> 00:29:09,473
I'll be happy with

734
00:29:09,794 --> 00:29:11,433
whatever you do.

735
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,913
Why do you smell like incense?

736
00:29:17,993 --> 00:29:19,034
Did you burn incense?

737
00:29:21,874 --> 00:29:22,874
To make a wish.

738
00:29:23,554 --> 00:29:26,034
That's how you found the job?

739
00:29:27,713 --> 00:29:28,713
So effective.

740
00:29:33,874 --> 00:29:34,554
Glasses.

741
00:29:34,634 --> 00:29:36,233
Come on, let's eat.

742
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,274
What?

743
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:10,633
Want to strangle me again?

744
00:30:11,233 --> 00:30:12,473
Let's not embarrass ourselves

745
00:30:13,314 --> 00:30:14,594
at the alumni reunion.

746
00:30:17,673 --> 00:30:18,673
What do you mean?

747
00:30:18,754 --> 00:30:19,794
Let's pretend

748
00:30:20,433 --> 00:30:21,673
to be a loving couple.

749
00:30:25,433 --> 00:30:26,433
Rest assured.

750
00:30:26,794 --> 00:30:28,034
When it comes to acting,

751
00:30:28,114 --> 00:30:29,633
I'm not any worse than you.

752
00:30:45,034 --> 00:30:46,034
Hu Xiaojiao.

753
00:30:47,314 --> 00:30:48,473
I'm warning you.

754
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:50,794
Don't mess with me.

755
00:30:50,993 --> 00:30:52,153
Or I will drag you down

756
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:53,393
with me.

757
00:31:44,514 --> 00:31:48,193
Live stream editing tutorial.

758
00:31:48,314 --> 00:31:49,154
What are you doing?

759
00:31:49,234 --> 00:31:50,433
Trying to be an influencer?

760
00:31:51,153 --> 00:31:52,993
Didn't I close the shop?

761
00:31:53,673 --> 00:31:55,674
I can't just go

762
00:31:55,754 --> 00:31:57,274
with the flow.

763
00:31:57,354 --> 00:31:58,473
I calculated it.

764
00:31:58,794 --> 00:32:00,234
Most of our sales

765
00:32:00,314 --> 00:32:02,233
come from online.

766
00:32:02,433 --> 00:32:03,275
So I think

767
00:32:03,355 --> 00:32:05,274
that online promotion is the key.

768
00:32:05,354 --> 00:32:07,193
I'll start a livestream.

769
00:32:07,473 --> 00:32:09,274
Not to be an influencer.

770
00:32:09,354 --> 00:32:11,153
I want to record

771
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:12,274
how I make food

772
00:32:12,354 --> 00:32:13,913
to show everyone that our ingredients

773
00:32:13,993 --> 00:32:14,754
are fresh

774
00:32:14,834 --> 00:32:15,554
and our products

775
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:16,714
are safe and reliable.

776
00:32:16,794 --> 00:32:19,274
We can attract new customers while

777
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:20,673
maintaining old customers.

778
00:32:21,834 --> 00:32:23,153
I don't quite understand.

779
00:32:23,433 --> 00:32:24,674
But I know that making money

780
00:32:24,754 --> 00:32:26,354
is more important than men.

781
00:32:26,514 --> 00:32:27,514
I thought your mind

782
00:32:27,594 --> 00:32:28,393
would be occupied

783
00:32:28,473 --> 00:32:29,275
by Mei Chengyi.

784
00:32:29,355 --> 00:32:31,073
I've always wanted

785
00:32:31,153 --> 00:32:32,153
everything.

786
00:32:32,314 --> 00:32:33,235
I want both men

787
00:32:33,315 --> 00:32:34,434
and money.

788
00:32:34,514 --> 00:32:35,594
I'll hold them firmly.

789
00:32:36,193 --> 00:32:36,755
Xu Kaixin.

790
00:32:36,835 --> 00:32:37,833
Why does it sound

791
00:32:37,913 --> 00:32:38,634
so vulgar?

792
00:32:38,714 --> 00:32:39,873
Clean your ears.

793
00:32:39,953 --> 00:32:41,354
Alright, I'll work on it.

794
00:32:41,874 --> 00:32:42,874
Let's be serious.

795
00:32:43,233 --> 00:32:44,594
Are you getting married?

796
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:45,754
Married?

797
00:32:47,473 --> 00:32:48,473
With Mei Chengyi?

798
00:32:49,514 --> 00:32:51,153
If we're going to

799
00:32:51,233 --> 00:32:53,233
get remarried,

800
00:32:53,354 --> 00:32:54,833
it will take several rounds

801
00:32:54,913 --> 00:32:55,755
of negotiations.

802
00:32:55,835 --> 00:32:57,074
It may fall apart.

803
00:32:57,473 --> 00:32:58,514
Let's see how it goes.

804
00:32:58,594 --> 00:32:59,954
Don't be so anxious.

805
00:33:00,034 --> 00:33:01,073
Besides, the first step

806
00:33:01,153 --> 00:33:02,913
is to get Lili and the kids

807
00:33:02,993 --> 00:33:03,993
to approve of him.

808
00:33:04,153 --> 00:33:05,474
If they don't approve,

809
00:33:05,554 --> 00:33:07,953
then it's the end for us, Mr. Mei.

810
00:33:10,354 --> 00:33:11,433
Isn't that Mr. Mei?

811
00:33:13,034 --> 00:33:14,353
The most untrustworthy man.

812
00:33:14,433 --> 00:33:15,433
Qian Hao.

813
00:33:19,354 --> 00:33:20,354
Hello?

814
00:33:22,034 --> 00:33:23,034
Kaixin,

815
00:33:23,354 --> 00:33:24,354
it's me.

816
00:33:25,193 --> 00:33:26,193
Listen.

817
00:33:28,233 --> 00:33:29,233
Here's the thing.

818
00:33:30,193 --> 00:33:30,834
Kaixin.

819
00:33:30,914 --> 00:33:32,434
The last reminder for you.

820
00:33:32,514 --> 00:33:33,994
Please call me Ms. Xu

821
00:33:34,074 --> 00:33:35,353
or Xu Kaixin.

822
00:33:35,433 --> 00:33:36,674
We are not so close

823
00:33:36,754 --> 00:33:38,953
that you can call me "Kaixin".

824
00:33:39,554 --> 00:33:40,354
Come on, Kaixin.

825
00:33:40,434 --> 00:33:42,433
I don't think we need to...

826
00:33:44,794 --> 00:33:45,794
Well done.

827
00:34:14,433 --> 00:34:15,114
Ms. Xu.

828
00:34:15,194 --> 00:34:16,194
I'm listening.

829
00:34:16,433 --> 00:34:17,154
Here's the thing.

830
00:34:17,234 --> 00:34:18,234
On the weekend,

831
00:34:18,354 --> 00:34:19,195
can I get

832
00:34:19,275 --> 00:34:20,274
Dami and Xiaomi over

833
00:34:20,354 --> 00:34:21,594
to see my mom

834
00:34:21,674 --> 00:34:22,554
and have fun?

835
00:34:22,634 --> 00:34:23,354
After all,

836
00:34:23,434 --> 00:34:24,473
you know my mom is not

837
00:34:24,553 --> 00:34:25,554
in a good condition.

838
00:34:25,634 --> 00:34:27,194
You can have Xiaomi, but not Dami.

839
00:34:30,794 --> 00:34:31,794
Alright then.

840
00:34:32,634 --> 00:34:33,674
Can I pick him up

841
00:34:34,154 --> 00:34:35,674
on the weekend?

842
00:34:35,913 --> 00:34:37,473
You know what Xiaomi is like.

843
00:34:37,553 --> 00:34:38,194
He won't go

844
00:34:38,274 --> 00:34:39,075
if Dami doesn't.

845
00:34:39,155 --> 00:34:40,234
Then why did you

846
00:34:40,314 --> 00:34:41,274
tease me?

847
00:34:41,354 --> 00:34:42,674
In the end,

848
00:34:42,794 --> 00:34:43,513
neither of them

849
00:34:43,593 --> 00:34:44,194
can visit.

850
00:34:44,274 --> 00:34:44,994
What do you want?

851
00:34:45,074 --> 00:34:46,274
Why can't Dami come?

852
00:34:46,354 --> 00:34:48,114
Because you don't value girls.

853
00:34:48,194 --> 00:34:49,274
Why would I let

854
00:34:49,354 --> 00:34:49,913
my baby girl

855
00:34:49,993 --> 00:34:50,714
go to your place

856
00:34:50,794 --> 00:34:51,794
to suffer?

857
00:34:52,354 --> 00:34:54,194
It won't happen, I promise.

858
00:34:54,274 --> 00:34:55,274
You promise?

859
00:34:59,553 --> 00:35:00,993
So what do you suggest?

860
00:35:01,073 --> 00:35:02,634
Pay a deposit of 5,000.

861
00:35:02,993 --> 00:35:04,154
If Dami comes home

862
00:35:04,234 --> 00:35:04,914
happily,

863
00:35:04,994 --> 00:35:06,114
I'll refund you.

864
00:35:06,194 --> 00:35:07,953
If she feels wronged in any way,

865
00:35:08,033 --> 00:35:09,593
I'll keep the money.

866
00:35:11,274 --> 00:35:12,274
Come on.

867
00:35:12,354 --> 00:35:13,353
Xu Kaixin, I'm her dad.

868
00:35:13,433 --> 00:35:14,794
Don't you remember?

869
00:35:14,993 --> 00:35:16,553
I almost forgot

870
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:17,874
that you're her dad.

871
00:35:19,234 --> 00:35:20,714
Five thousand is too much, 2000.

872
00:35:20,794 --> 00:35:21,553
Eight thousand.

873
00:35:21,754 --> 00:35:23,033
Let's see how much it raises.

874
00:35:23,113 --> 00:35:24,154
No, that's enough.

875
00:35:24,234 --> 00:35:25,674
Eight thousand then. Stop it.

876
00:35:25,913 --> 00:35:26,913
But promise you won't

877
00:35:26,993 --> 00:35:28,393
withhold the deposit maliciously.

878
00:35:28,473 --> 00:35:29,674
You'd better

879
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:31,714
worry about your mom rather than me.

880
00:35:31,794 --> 00:35:33,953
Tell her if she treats Dami poorly,

881
00:35:34,073 --> 00:35:35,073
it'd be very costly.

882
00:35:35,194 --> 00:35:35,953
Okay, enough.

883
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:36,714
I'll transfer you

884
00:35:36,794 --> 00:35:37,794
the money.

885
00:35:39,714 --> 00:35:41,593
So we have a deal.

886
00:35:41,754 --> 00:35:43,433
I'll pick them up this weekend.

887
00:35:44,553 --> 00:35:45,834
And you know.

888
00:35:46,473 --> 00:35:47,594
We'll need to talk

889
00:35:47,674 --> 00:35:48,474
about the kids.

890
00:35:48,554 --> 00:35:50,795
- Can I add you on WeChat?
- Bye-bye.

891
00:35:50,875 --> 00:35:52,194
Not yet, wait.

892
00:35:53,354 --> 00:35:54,953
Are you going to the class reunion?

893
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:56,433
Why not?

894
00:36:07,513 --> 00:36:08,513
Women get

895
00:36:08,593 --> 00:36:10,354
so difficult as they age.

896
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,953
You were so cool.

897
00:36:20,033 --> 00:36:21,274
Applause for you.

898
00:36:21,354 --> 00:36:22,714
I would put a subtitle saying,

899
00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:24,393
"I will protect my daughter."

900
00:36:25,194 --> 00:36:26,833
With an in-law like you,

901
00:36:26,913 --> 00:36:27,715
Dami's in-laws

902
00:36:27,795 --> 00:36:29,033
won't ever bully her.

903
00:36:29,113 --> 00:36:30,113
Come on.

904
00:36:30,234 --> 00:36:31,833
I'm simply mending the barn

905
00:36:31,913 --> 00:36:32,993
after the sheep are lost.

906
00:36:33,073 --> 00:36:34,114
My kids have a lame dad

907
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:35,993
all because of me.

908
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:37,474
Did I get

909
00:36:37,554 --> 00:36:38,754
soft-hearted?

910
00:36:38,834 --> 00:36:39,474
Given

911
00:36:39,554 --> 00:36:40,554
how they were

912
00:36:40,634 --> 00:36:41,873
when Dami was sick,

913
00:36:41,953 --> 00:36:43,634
I shouldn't have said yes.

914
00:36:44,993 --> 00:36:45,754
But

915
00:36:45,834 --> 00:36:47,354
she's their grandma, after all.

916
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:49,234
Besides, she's having a hard time.

917
00:36:49,393 --> 00:36:50,194
Forget it.

918
00:36:50,354 --> 00:36:52,554
No one is pitiful without cause.

919
00:36:52,634 --> 00:36:53,275
If they

920
00:36:53,355 --> 00:36:54,754
treat Dami badly,

921
00:36:54,834 --> 00:36:56,433
I will not let them off.

922
00:36:58,113 --> 00:36:59,114
The heavens

923
00:36:59,194 --> 00:36:59,994
gave my kids

924
00:37:00,074 --> 00:37:02,354
a father and grandmother
who don't deserve them.

925
00:37:03,593 --> 00:37:05,353
But it also gave them

926
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:07,834
an excellent mother and Lili.

927
00:37:08,553 --> 00:37:10,354
Isn't this the conservation of energy?

928
00:37:10,953 --> 00:37:12,874
I'm not so bothered anymore.

929
00:37:13,513 --> 00:37:14,993
Do you ever get bothered?

930
00:37:15,913 --> 00:37:16,913
Yeah.

931
00:37:17,073 --> 00:37:18,073
By what?

932
00:37:21,993 --> 00:37:22,993
What?

933
00:37:29,473 --> 00:37:30,593
What's going on?

934
00:37:31,154 --> 00:37:31,874
No way.

935
00:37:31,954 --> 00:37:33,593
Xu Kaixin, your scale is broken.

936
00:37:34,284 --> 00:37:35,544
(WeChat: 1 Message)

937
00:37:38,593 --> 00:37:40,312
(Mei Chengyi: Good night. Sweet dreams.)

938
00:37:42,136 --> 00:37:43,608
(Xu Kaixin: Are you free next week?)

939
00:37:43,608 --> 00:37:44,874
(My family wants to meet you.)

940
00:37:46,834 --> 00:37:47,834
(At your command.)

941
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:48,056
(Mei Chengyi: At your command.)

942
00:38:48,874 --> 00:38:49,953
(Mom: Were you busy?)

943
00:38:50,234 --> 00:38:51,634
(I haven't received the money.)

944
00:39:09,274 --> 00:39:10,488
(Hu Xiaojiao: You're right.)

945
00:39:10,953 --> 00:39:11,954
(In marriage,)

946
00:39:11,954 --> 00:39:14,593
(the brave one always wins.)

947
00:39:15,113 --> 00:39:17,154
(Ever since I became ruthless,)

948
00:39:17,234 --> 00:39:19,194
(they've been suffering.)

949
00:39:20,794 --> 00:39:22,674
(You sound very experienced.)

950
00:39:23,073 --> 00:39:24,073
(Are you married?)

951
00:39:30,874 --> 00:39:32,674
(Tianya: I'm divorced and single.)

952
00:39:37,754 --> 00:39:38,754
(That's good.)

953
00:39:39,113 --> 00:39:39,994
(Otherwise,)

954
00:39:40,074 --> 00:39:41,154
(your wife might be upset)

955
00:39:41,234 --> 00:39:42,473
(about us chatting.)

956
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,554
(I'm always here.)

957
00:39:50,634 --> 00:39:51,874
(Whenever you want to talk.)

958
00:39:59,234 --> 00:40:00,075
(Can you tell me)

959
00:40:00,155 --> 00:40:01,234
(who you are?)

960
00:40:01,634 --> 00:40:02,634
