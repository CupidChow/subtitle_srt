I'm so mad.

18
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:45,672
You gave birth

19
00:01:45,752 --> 00:01:46,312
to them both.

20
00:01:46,392 --> 00:01:48,312
How can Dami and Xiaomi be so different?

21
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:49,752
I'll only buy Xiaomi things.

22
00:01:49,832 --> 00:01:51,192
Nothing for Qian Dami anymore.

23
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:53,592
I want to return those things.

24
00:01:53,711 --> 00:01:54,511
Return them.

25
00:01:58,351 --> 00:01:59,351
Don't be mad.

26
00:02:00,071 --> 00:02:00,791
It's all my fault.

27
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,271
I should've played blind.

28
00:02:02,672 --> 00:02:03,912
It ruined our good mood.

29
00:02:05,392 --> 00:02:06,312
Dad, Ms. Hu,

30
00:02:06,392 --> 00:02:07,592
my stomach hurts a bit.

31
00:02:07,672 --> 00:02:08,991
I want to go to the toilet.

32
00:02:09,071 --> 00:02:09,792
Then hurry up.

33
00:02:09,872 --> 00:02:10,591
You need Ms. Hu?

34
00:02:10,671 --> 00:02:11,991
No, I'm a big kid now.

35
00:02:12,071 --> 00:02:12,952
I'll be right back.

36
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:13,591
We'll wait.

37
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:14,352
Take it slow.

38
00:02:14,432 --> 00:02:15,071
Okay.

39
00:02:17,791 --> 00:02:18,592
Honey,

40
00:02:18,912 --> 00:02:19,591
I didn't expect

41
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:21,312
Dami would actually defend me.

42
00:02:22,472 --> 00:02:24,071
She's young and easy to sweet-talk.

43
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:25,312
Easy to sweet-talk?

44
00:02:25,671 --> 00:02:26,311
Look.

45
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:27,471
It took so much money.

46
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:28,912
Don't you realize the fact?

47
00:02:29,071 --> 00:02:29,951
No?

48
00:02:31,872 --> 00:02:32,871
It's small money.

49
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:34,271
I'll compensate you later, okay?

50
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:35,111
I will.

51
00:02:49,071 --> 00:02:49,912
Wait a moment.

52
00:02:53,472 --> 00:02:54,472
Speak up!

53
00:02:54,912 --> 00:02:55,712
Hello, Mom.

54
00:02:58,831 --> 00:02:59,512
Don't be mad

55
00:02:59,592 --> 00:03:00,872
at what I just said.

56
00:03:01,071 --> 00:03:02,192
Mom, don't worry.

57
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:04,072
Dad treats me very well this time.

58
00:03:04,152 --> 00:03:05,752
He's bought me many things.

59
00:03:05,912 --> 00:03:06,551
And

60
00:03:06,631 --> 00:03:07,632
all those classes'

61
00:03:07,712 --> 00:03:08,232
fees?

62
00:03:08,312 --> 00:03:09,311
He's paid them all.

63
00:03:09,391 --> 00:03:11,032
He said I should register again.

64
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:12,632
When I get home, I'll tell you

65
00:03:12,712 --> 00:03:13,472
the details.

66
00:03:16,432 --> 00:03:17,072
I need to go.

67
00:03:17,152 --> 00:03:17,951
See you.

68
00:03:19,152 --> 00:03:20,151
Take care of yourself.

69
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:21,231
Don't play too long.

70
00:03:22,671 --> 00:03:23,551
Xu Kaixin.

71
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:26,032
Did I hear that right?

72
00:03:27,752 --> 00:03:29,752
As expected of my daughter.

73
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,256
(My location to Happy Cake Shop)

74
00:03:53,032 --> 00:03:53,831
Sir.

75
00:03:55,272 --> 00:03:56,071
Sir.

76
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,512
I want to buy a fruit basket.
Pick some good ones for me.

77
00:03:59,592 --> 00:04:00,432
Okay.

78
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:01,591
For the bottom,

79
00:04:01,671 --> 00:04:02,912
get some apples

80
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,671
or other cheaper fruits.

81
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:05,632
For the top,

82
00:04:05,712 --> 00:04:07,831
get some slightly more expensive fruits.

83
00:04:08,111 --> 00:04:09,591
Make it both fancy and affordable.

84
00:04:09,671 --> 00:04:10,551
Okay.

85
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:12,031
- Please wait here.
- Okay.

86
00:04:12,111 --> 00:04:13,072
It'll be ready soon.

87
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:13,712
Okay.

88
00:04:13,872 --> 00:04:14,631
Bird's nest?

89
00:04:15,551 --> 00:04:16,632
Ejiao cubes?

90
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:18,432
Dami is only eight.

91
00:04:18,512 --> 00:04:19,671
She can't possibly eat these.

92
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:21,752
These are for me.

93
00:04:21,832 --> 00:04:22,632
Xu Kaixin,

94
00:04:23,032 --> 00:04:23,952
don't be so cheeky.

95
00:04:24,032 --> 00:04:24,952
I won't pay.

96
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,272
Pay for it yourself.

97
00:04:26,832 --> 00:04:27,512
I'm just

98
00:04:27,592 --> 00:04:28,872
taking advantage of my daughter.

99
00:04:28,952 --> 00:04:29,911
Stop it.

100
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:31,512
I'm buying things for Dami only.

101
00:04:31,592 --> 00:04:32,952
Let's eat hot pot today.

102
00:04:33,311 --> 00:04:34,351
Sure.

103
00:04:35,712 --> 00:04:37,111
I want to eat spicy hot pot.

104
00:04:38,632 --> 00:04:39,431
Excuse me.

105
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:42,671
Weirdo.

106
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:46,271
Why

107
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:47,351
are hot guys' girlfriends

108
00:04:47,431 --> 00:04:48,312
all so ordinary?

109
00:04:48,392 --> 00:04:48,952
Yet nobody

110
00:04:49,032 --> 00:04:50,032
wants a beauty like me.

111
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,192
She's not ordinary at all.

112
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:54,072
She is very good-looking.

113
00:05:02,191 --> 00:05:03,351
Am I not good-looking?

114
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:04,832
Paw Patrol, attention!

115
00:05:05,351 --> 00:05:06,671
Your task today

116
00:05:06,952 --> 00:05:08,952
is to find

117
00:05:09,512 --> 00:05:11,471
the captain's lost slipper

118
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,431
and bring it back.

119
00:05:13,991 --> 00:05:15,272
If you find it,

120
00:05:15,472 --> 00:05:16,271
you'll be rewarded.

121
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:16,952
Okay?

122
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:17,552
Okay.

123
00:05:17,632 --> 00:05:19,832
Now, heed Captain Ryder's order.

124
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:22,512
Paw Patrol, move out!

125
00:05:33,632 --> 00:05:34,472
I'm taking a break.

126
00:05:38,311 --> 00:05:39,431
Did you find it?

127
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:40,671
No.

128
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:42,712
Hurry up.

129
00:05:43,392 --> 00:05:44,231
You need to find it.

130
00:05:47,592 --> 00:05:48,472
Where is it?

131
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:53,392
Take it out quickly.

132
00:05:53,472 --> 00:05:55,032
I can't believe you.

133
00:05:55,152 --> 00:05:56,471
It's for me to catch a breath

134
00:05:56,551 --> 00:05:57,912
and take a rest, okay?

135
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,192
You know what?

136
00:05:59,272 --> 00:06:00,911
For these two little ones,

137
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:01,832
my heart problem

138
00:06:01,912 --> 00:06:03,231
almost flared up.

139
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:05,512
Whose fault is that?

140
00:06:06,191 --> 00:06:07,952
You rushed to the next building

141
00:06:08,152 --> 00:06:09,072
early in the morning

142
00:06:09,152 --> 00:06:10,431
to get the kids over here.

143
00:06:11,032 --> 00:06:12,431
Without the skills,

144
00:06:12,512 --> 00:06:14,311
you tried to handle a difficult task.

145
00:06:20,152 --> 00:06:21,032
Think about it.

146
00:06:22,032 --> 00:06:23,271
In this family,

147
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:25,471
three grown-ups make no other movement

148
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,271
besides breathing

149
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:27,871
day after day.

150
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:29,671
Looking at Yu'an and Yule

151
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:31,032
reminds me

152
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:33,271
of Youyou and her sister

153
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,431
in the past.

154
00:06:36,632 --> 00:06:37,472
It was so wonderful.

155
00:06:41,392 --> 00:06:42,191
Moreover,

156
00:06:43,032 --> 00:06:45,032
Mei Chengyi wants to remarry.

157
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:46,911
We don't know

158
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:48,231
about the woman at all.

159
00:06:48,952 --> 00:06:50,432
Will she be like us,

160
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:52,152
tolerant of the kids all the time?

161
00:06:52,392 --> 00:06:54,632
What if she makes them suffer secretly?

162
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:56,912
Shouldn't I spoil the kids a bit more?

163
00:06:57,311 --> 00:06:58,671
Come on.

164
00:06:59,472 --> 00:07:01,152
Your two perfect angels

165
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:02,952
who look sweet to outsiders are in fact

166
00:07:03,032 --> 00:07:04,031
little schemers.

167
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:05,632
They won't be at a disadvantage.

168
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:07,231
That's not necessarily true.

169
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:12,231
Oh no.

170
00:07:12,392 --> 00:07:13,632
They've made trouble again.

171
00:07:18,191 --> 00:07:19,432
It's lowercase c.

172
00:07:19,512 --> 00:07:21,031
Great-aunt, you said it wrong.

173
00:07:21,111 --> 00:07:21,952
I'm upset.

174
00:07:22,392 --> 00:07:23,231
Why are you upset?

175
00:07:23,311 --> 00:07:25,231
Look, you read it wrong.

176
00:07:26,272 --> 00:07:27,032
Hello, are you...

177
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:30,512
Qin Sulan, what are you here for?

178
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,752
I'm here to see my grandson, Xiaomi.

179
00:07:32,832 --> 00:07:33,752
Are you snatching him?

180
00:07:33,832 --> 00:07:34,832
I'm telling you.

181
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,911
We have surveillance here.
So don't do that.

182
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:37,752
Don't joke.

183
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,111
Why would I snatch him?

184
00:07:39,191 --> 00:07:39,832
As you know,

185
00:07:39,912 --> 00:07:41,192
we are all cultured people.

186
00:07:41,272 --> 00:07:43,032
I wouldn't do such a thing.

187
00:07:43,512 --> 00:07:44,952
I'm here to see Xiaomi.

188
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:45,872
I've missed you.

189
00:07:45,952 --> 00:07:47,351
Here, look.

190
00:07:47,431 --> 00:07:48,152
These are for you.

191
00:07:48,871 --> 00:07:49,471
Xiaomi,

192
00:07:49,551 --> 00:07:51,512
look at the airplane I bought for you.

193
00:07:51,592 --> 00:07:53,512
It's your favorite airplane.

194
00:07:54,712 --> 00:07:55,632
What's wrong with you?

195
00:07:55,712 --> 00:07:57,472
Why don't you recognize me?

196
00:07:57,751 --> 00:07:59,551
You don't love me at all.

197
00:08:00,032 --> 00:08:01,271
You're talking nonsense.

198
00:08:01,351 --> 00:08:03,312
I love you the most.

199
00:08:03,392 --> 00:08:05,632
You are my treasure.

200
00:08:05,832 --> 00:08:07,311
I know everything.

201
00:08:08,111 --> 00:08:10,272
Dad never pays child support.

202
00:08:10,472 --> 00:08:12,632
It's Mom who raises my sister and me.

203
00:08:12,712 --> 00:08:14,431
You don't really love me.

204
00:08:14,832 --> 00:08:16,832
That's not true.

205
00:08:17,712 --> 00:08:18,711
Your dad and I

206
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,952
are planning to save a lot,

207
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:21,911
all for Xiaomi.

208
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:22,552
How about it?

209
00:08:26,032 --> 00:08:26,832
Sweeties,

210
00:08:26,912 --> 00:08:28,152
let's go into the room.

211
00:08:28,472 --> 00:08:30,031
Grandpa still needs to clean up.

212
00:08:30,111 --> 00:08:31,031
Don't get hurt.

213
00:08:31,111 --> 00:08:32,312
Good girls.

214
00:08:32,392 --> 00:08:33,791
Come on in.

215
00:08:40,512 --> 00:08:41,112
Youyou.

216
00:08:42,032 --> 00:08:42,752
Get up.

217
00:08:43,352 --> 00:08:43,992
Youyou?

218
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:46,152
Youyou?

219
00:08:46,272 --> 00:08:47,551
Time to get up.

220
00:08:47,632 --> 00:08:48,152
This home

221
00:08:48,232 --> 00:08:49,391
is all in a mess.

222
00:08:49,471 --> 00:08:51,152
You don't even come out and help.

223
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:54,152
Stop this night-for-day nonsense.

224
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:55,791
Get up.

225
00:08:56,711 --> 00:08:59,112
- What?
- What are you doing?

226
00:08:59,632 --> 00:09:01,711
Don't take it out on the kid
when you're tired.

227
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:03,511
Do you have a grudge against each other?

228
00:09:03,591 --> 00:09:04,432
It's the weekend.

229
00:09:04,512 --> 00:09:05,992
What's wrong with sleeping in?

230
00:09:06,431 --> 00:09:07,791
Focus on your things.

231
00:09:07,912 --> 00:09:09,351
You're spoiling her.

232
00:09:09,431 --> 00:09:10,591
"What's wrong"?

233
00:09:11,392 --> 00:09:12,791
Don't you know she is ill?

234
00:09:13,112 --> 00:09:14,912
She is mentally ill.

235
00:09:16,311 --> 00:09:17,711
Which young woman in her twenties

236
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,392
doesn't work?

237
00:09:19,632 --> 00:09:20,231
Every day,

238
00:09:20,311 --> 00:09:21,912
she plays games day and night.

239
00:09:21,992 --> 00:09:23,551
My daughter works.

240
00:09:23,632 --> 00:09:25,351
She is the senior housekeeper here.

241
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,032
This is a new term abroad.

242
00:09:27,112 --> 00:09:28,112
Understand?

243
00:09:28,431 --> 00:09:29,232
Nonsense.

244
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:31,112
We're just ordinary people.

245
00:09:31,311 --> 00:09:32,351
We need no housekeeper.

246
00:09:32,431 --> 00:09:33,752
Let alone a senior one.

247
00:09:34,311 --> 00:09:35,272
Besides,

248
00:09:35,352 --> 00:09:36,591
even if we're hiring,

249
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:37,832
she has to apply.

250
00:09:37,912 --> 00:09:38,552
Hiring her

251
00:09:38,632 --> 00:09:40,752
is no better
than hiring a live-in nanny.

252
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:42,391
With 6,000 or 7,000 yuan a month,

253
00:09:42,471 --> 00:09:43,032
a nanny

254
00:09:43,112 --> 00:09:44,351
can do everything well for us.

255
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:45,672
She only puts on airs with me.

256
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:46,832
And she asks for more money

257
00:09:46,912 --> 00:09:48,032
if I ask her for a favor.

258
00:09:48,311 --> 00:09:49,511
And you just casually

259
00:09:49,591 --> 00:09:51,191
find reasons to give her money.

260
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:55,632
I'm glad to give my daughter money.

261
00:09:56,032 --> 00:09:56,792
Kick us out

262
00:09:56,872 --> 00:09:57,992
if you have the guts.

263
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,791
You can keep your money well.

264
00:10:03,112 --> 00:10:04,752
I'm reasoning with you.

265
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:07,112
You are playing rogue with me.

266
00:10:10,831 --> 00:10:11,791
Just spoil her.

267
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:14,431
One day you'll regret it.

268
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:35,192
Are you satisfied?

269
00:10:35,272 --> 00:10:36,392
We've bought so many things.

270
00:10:36,632 --> 00:10:37,431
I'm happy.

271
00:10:37,831 --> 00:10:38,591
Happy, huh?

272
00:10:40,471 --> 00:10:41,752
Hello, Uncle.

273
00:10:44,752 --> 00:10:45,272
Okay.

274
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:46,296
Okay.

275
00:10:46,632 --> 00:10:47,191
What's up?

276
00:10:47,632 --> 00:10:48,312
My uncle wants us

277
00:10:48,392 --> 00:10:49,312
to eat at his place.

278
00:10:49,392 --> 00:10:50,872
Tell him we'll be there soon.

279
00:10:51,632 --> 00:10:52,631
Do you want to anger him?

280
00:10:52,711 --> 00:10:53,551
She's with us.

281
00:10:58,912 --> 00:10:59,711
Well.

282
00:10:59,912 --> 00:11:01,032
I have something to do now.

283
00:11:01,112 --> 00:11:02,391
I'll send you back to your mom's

284
00:11:02,471 --> 00:11:03,032
place for now.

285
00:11:03,152 --> 00:11:04,591
When I'm done with my things,

286
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:05,392
I promise

287
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:07,032
you can come back anytime.

288
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:08,872
Okay.

289
00:11:12,272 --> 00:11:12,831
Alright.

290
00:11:18,872 --> 00:11:19,711
Here is 500 yuan.

291
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:22,512
Your pocket money.

292
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:24,832
Take it, okay?

293
00:11:24,912 --> 00:11:25,632
Keep it well.

294
00:11:27,392 --> 00:11:28,152
Okay.

295
00:11:29,272 --> 00:11:30,192
Can I have my own room

296
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,831
at your place in the future?

297
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:33,711
I don't want to sleep
on the sofa anymore.

298
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:35,912
Of course.

299
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:37,232
I promise you.

300
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:38,551
I'll make it happen.

301
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:39,512
Alright?

302
00:11:39,711 --> 00:11:40,232
Okay.

303
00:11:41,032 --> 00:11:41,632
Take it.

304
00:11:43,752 --> 00:11:44,591
Pocket it.

305
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:49,152
Let's go.

306
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,191
Lili, we're back.

307
00:12:01,032 --> 00:12:02,551
Lili, what's wrong?

308
00:12:04,032 --> 00:12:05,551
Qian Hao's mom came by.

309
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:07,112
Why did she come?

310
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:09,152
She didn't take Xiaomi away, did she?

311
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,392
I'll go see her right now.

312
00:12:10,992 --> 00:12:12,032
Mom,

313
00:12:12,112 --> 00:12:14,032
I'm having a poo.

314
00:12:14,352 --> 00:12:14,952
Okay.

315
00:12:15,032 --> 00:12:16,191
Don't come out.

316
00:12:16,912 --> 00:12:18,591
I'll wipe it for you. Don't come out.

317
00:12:19,032 --> 00:12:19,831
It's okay.

318
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:34,352
Thank you.

319
00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:35,831
Please enjoy.

320
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:42,832
Honey, you've worked hard.

321
00:12:42,912 --> 00:12:44,112
Here, have a bite of cake.

322
00:12:44,352 --> 00:12:45,391
Dami's various classes

323
00:12:45,471 --> 00:12:47,312
cost 60,000 yuan.

324
00:12:47,392 --> 00:12:48,351
Today, we've bought her

325
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:50,312
and Xiaomi clothes, stationery,

326
00:12:50,392 --> 00:12:51,832
massagers, and toys.

327
00:12:51,912 --> 00:12:53,391
Altogether, it was nearly 5,000 yuan.

328
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:54,432
And you also gave her

329
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:55,431
500 yuan in cash.

330
00:12:55,632 --> 00:12:56,791
I'm wondering:

331
00:12:56,912 --> 00:12:58,351
if they come a few more times

332
00:12:58,431 --> 00:13:00,272
and we get custody of them,

333
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:00,912
won't

334
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:02,591
our family go bankrupt?

335
00:13:02,752 --> 00:13:03,791
How could that be?

336
00:13:03,992 --> 00:13:05,152
It won't be that bad.

337
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:06,032
The class fees

338
00:13:06,112 --> 00:13:07,032
are paid for a year.

339
00:13:07,112 --> 00:13:08,591
And clothes last one to two years.

340
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:10,391
We won't spend like this every time.

341
00:13:10,471 --> 00:13:11,632
Here, eat some cake.

342
00:13:11,752 --> 00:13:13,192
Their excuses

343
00:13:13,272 --> 00:13:14,951
will vary each time.

344
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:17,231
If you give all the money

345
00:13:17,311 --> 00:13:19,191
you earn from my uncle to them,

346
00:13:20,431 --> 00:13:21,152
I don't think

347
00:13:21,232 --> 00:13:22,471
we can go on.

348
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,272
It won't happen.

349
00:13:23,352 --> 00:13:24,912
I'm not stupid, alright?

350
00:13:25,032 --> 00:13:26,831
Just this once. It won't happen again.

351
00:13:26,992 --> 00:13:28,032
I promise. Have some cake.

352
00:13:28,112 --> 00:13:29,551
You are stupid.

353
00:13:29,912 --> 00:13:30,631
You and your mom

354
00:13:30,711 --> 00:13:32,431
are crazy about having kids

355
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,831
and are being played by them.

356
00:13:34,912 --> 00:13:35,752
Honey,

357
00:13:36,471 --> 00:13:37,511
you are usually sharp

358
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:38,991
as a tack.

359
00:13:39,071 --> 00:13:39,832
Why is it like

360
00:13:39,912 --> 00:13:40,711
you are possessed

361
00:13:40,791 --> 00:13:42,152
when it comes to Dami and Xiaomi?

362
00:13:43,071 --> 00:13:44,032
Is it the bloodline?

363
00:13:44,711 --> 00:13:47,399
If they really come back,
will there be room for me?

364
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,312
That's enough, okay?

365
00:13:48,392 --> 00:13:49,632
You're getting out of line.

366
00:13:59,711 --> 00:14:01,392
Why are you upset again?

367
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,471
You don't look good when you're upset.

368
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,791
Right, baby?

369
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,312
Rest assured.

370
00:14:07,392 --> 00:14:08,152
In my heart,

371
00:14:08,232 --> 00:14:09,631
you're always number one.

372
00:14:09,711 --> 00:14:10,551
Alright?

373
00:14:10,752 --> 00:14:11,991
Come on, give me a smile.

374
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:13,272
We need to visit your uncle.

375
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:14,232
Smile.

376
00:14:14,752 --> 00:14:16,311
I can't smile. It'll be fake.

377
00:14:17,272 --> 00:14:18,551
Are you done?

378
00:14:20,032 --> 00:14:20,672
You are always

379
00:14:20,752 --> 00:14:21,471
on your mom's side

380
00:14:21,551 --> 00:14:22,992
whenever she acts against me.

381
00:14:23,352 --> 00:14:24,831
At most, I rank second.

382
00:14:37,632 --> 00:14:39,191
Actually, being second is pretty good.

383
00:14:39,272 --> 00:14:40,152
As long as you

384
00:14:40,232 --> 00:14:42,112
don't let me drop any further,
that'll be fine.

385
00:14:48,112 --> 00:14:49,032
Let's eat cake.

386
00:15:02,912 --> 00:15:03,511
Some more?

387
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:05,512
You eat, baby. Rebound.

388
00:15:13,831 --> 00:15:15,671
I need to calculate again.

389
00:15:28,935 --> 00:15:30,392
(Bank Card)

390
00:15:30,632 --> 00:15:31,951
Just this morning,

391
00:15:32,112 --> 00:15:32,832
your kids got

392
00:15:32,912 --> 00:15:33,991
all the owed child support

393
00:15:34,071 --> 00:15:34,871
from their dad

394
00:15:34,951 --> 00:15:36,232
and grandma.

395
00:15:36,992 --> 00:15:37,711
My logic

396
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:38,351
is totally

397
00:15:38,431 --> 00:15:39,032
off the track.

398
00:15:40,191 --> 00:15:40,871
Should I

399
00:15:40,951 --> 00:15:41,871
take Xiaomi to my place

400
00:15:41,951 --> 00:15:42,912
to make me some fortune?

401
00:15:43,071 --> 00:15:44,071
Cut the nonsense.

402
00:15:44,671 --> 00:15:46,392
You've got me all confused.

403
00:15:47,032 --> 00:15:47,631
No.

404
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,432
I have to find out
if there's money in it.

405
00:15:49,512 --> 00:15:50,311
Hurry.

406
00:15:55,992 --> 00:15:57,071
Why are you here?

407
00:16:00,752 --> 00:16:01,551
Finished talking?

408
00:16:04,032 --> 00:16:04,831
The chat went well.

409
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:06,872
Now it's my turn.

410
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:09,552
Ms. Xu,

411
00:16:09,632 --> 00:16:10,632
take a look.

412
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:12,591
Are these what you saw

413
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:13,512
in my bag earlier?

414
00:16:13,688 --> 00:16:14,424
(Thin, 0 feel)

415
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,111
And then you told her,

416
00:16:17,191 --> 00:16:18,831
a matchmaker,

417
00:16:19,232 --> 00:16:19,791
right?

418
00:16:21,791 --> 00:16:22,952
We are good friends.

419
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:23,871
She's my bestie.

420
00:16:23,951 --> 00:16:26,791
It was a sharing between besties.

421
00:16:27,232 --> 00:16:28,032
Besties?

422
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,512
Take a good look.

423
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:37,232
This is the product test report.

424
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:38,192
My job

425
00:16:38,272 --> 00:16:39,152
is written clearly

426
00:16:39,232 --> 00:16:40,591
in my matchmaking profile.

427
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,552
I plan events for an e-commerce company.

428
00:16:42,632 --> 00:16:45,231
These products
are for the special live broadcast

429
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,912
during the Qixi Festival.

430
00:16:47,112 --> 00:16:48,432
I talked with the suppliers,

431
00:16:48,512 --> 00:16:50,471
and then I took these products
for inspection.

432
00:16:50,591 --> 00:16:52,072
You acted strangely that day.

433
00:16:52,152 --> 00:16:53,591
I wanted to explain it to you,

434
00:16:53,671 --> 00:16:54,991
but you said it wasn't necessary.

435
00:16:55,071 --> 00:16:56,272
Then you immediately said

436
00:16:56,352 --> 00:16:58,791
I am a womanizer and scumbag,

437
00:17:00,191 --> 00:17:01,471
making this matchmaker,

438
00:17:01,752 --> 00:17:02,671
who's also your bestie,

439
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:04,792
unjustifiably insult me.

440
00:17:05,991 --> 00:17:07,072
You went on a date with me

441
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:07,832
knowing it's me.

442
00:17:07,912 --> 00:17:08,712
Are you a decoy

443
00:17:08,792 --> 00:17:10,191
for the matchmaking studio?

444
00:17:13,552 --> 00:17:14,832
The test report is real, huh?

445
00:17:15,112 --> 00:17:16,191
It seems real.

446
00:17:16,271 --> 00:17:17,431
Then we were excessive.

447
00:17:17,711 --> 00:17:18,832
We were.

448
00:17:26,152 --> 00:17:26,991
What's this?

449
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:28,191
Mr. Mei,

450
00:17:28,711 --> 00:17:29,872
regarding this matter,

451
00:17:30,352 --> 00:17:31,111
it is my fault

452
00:17:31,191 --> 00:17:32,511
for not investigating thoroughly.

453
00:17:33,072 --> 00:17:34,711
I sincerely apologize to you.

454
00:17:35,271 --> 00:17:36,631
If this matter

455
00:17:36,711 --> 00:17:37,752
caused others to have

456
00:17:37,832 --> 00:17:39,231
a huge misunderstanding about you,

457
00:17:39,671 --> 00:17:41,592
I can help explain it for you.

458
00:17:41,872 --> 00:17:43,431
How about I treat you to a meal?

459
00:17:44,632 --> 00:17:45,431
Or

460
00:17:45,671 --> 00:17:47,471
I can compensate you
for mental distress.

461
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:49,431
Anyway,

462
00:17:49,511 --> 00:17:51,191
regarding this matter,

463
00:17:51,431 --> 00:17:52,151
let's solve it

464
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:53,431
any way you see fit.

465
00:17:53,511 --> 00:17:54,232
Okay?

466
00:17:54,312 --> 00:17:55,431
I don't need anything.

467
00:17:56,352 --> 00:17:57,671
I only need the two of you

468
00:17:57,751 --> 00:17:59,431
to stay away from my life for good

469
00:18:00,031 --> 00:18:01,471
and cause each other no trouble.

470
00:18:01,671 --> 00:18:03,072
I came here today because

471
00:18:03,191 --> 00:18:04,591
I don't want to take the blame.

472
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,632
Am I being clear?

473
00:18:15,671 --> 00:18:17,231
This is bad, Xu Kaixin.

474
00:18:17,352 --> 00:18:18,111
You turned away

475
00:18:18,191 --> 00:18:19,312
a top-quality guy.

476
00:18:19,471 --> 00:18:20,111
We did that

477
00:18:20,191 --> 00:18:21,111
together, remember?

478
00:18:21,191 --> 00:18:22,632
I did not.

479
00:18:22,872 --> 00:18:23,512
Can you

480
00:18:23,592 --> 00:18:25,031
reimburse me for that 3,600?

481
00:18:25,951 --> 00:18:27,392
Here, take it.

482
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:32,871
(Just this morning,)

483
00:18:32,951 --> 00:18:33,631
(your kids got)

484
00:18:33,711 --> 00:18:34,832
(all the owed child support)

485
00:18:34,912 --> 00:18:35,712
(from their dad)

486
00:18:35,792 --> 00:18:37,072
(and grandma.)

487
00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:38,711
Those great kids

488
00:18:39,471 --> 00:18:40,991
have been ruined by such a mother.

489
00:18:42,152 --> 00:18:43,031
She is

490
00:18:43,511 --> 00:18:44,631
a walking disaster.

491
00:18:44,711 --> 00:18:46,271
I hope I never meet her again.

492
00:18:47,951 --> 00:18:49,072
Come on, Xiaojiao.

493
00:18:49,271 --> 00:18:50,272
Have a shrimp first.

494
00:18:50,352 --> 00:18:50,871
Okay.

495
00:18:50,951 --> 00:18:51,792
Your aunt

496
00:18:51,872 --> 00:18:53,591
got up early to prepare all the food.

497
00:18:53,671 --> 00:18:54,991
She said she missed you

498
00:18:55,191 --> 00:18:56,632
and asked me to call you over.

499
00:18:58,031 --> 00:18:59,431
It's a blessing for our family

500
00:18:59,511 --> 00:19:00,552
that you care about her.

501
00:19:00,632 --> 00:19:02,031
Uncle, I toast to you.

502
00:19:04,751 --> 00:19:06,312
Xiaojiao, why have you become thin?

503
00:19:08,271 --> 00:19:09,272
Uncle, I'm losing weight.

504
00:19:09,352 --> 00:19:10,991
Hurry up, Qian Hao is toasting you.

505
00:19:15,671 --> 00:19:16,471
Honey.

506
00:19:18,552 --> 00:19:19,352
You...

507
00:19:19,711 --> 00:19:21,471
You'll be hurt by being a love fool.

508
00:19:22,191 --> 00:19:23,632
Uncle, you're joking.

509
00:19:23,951 --> 00:19:25,351
Xiaojiao is my family's treasure.

510
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:27,112
We spoil her as much as we can.

511
00:19:28,112 --> 00:19:31,112
Qian Hao, all men are like foxes.

512
00:19:31,352 --> 00:19:32,872
When it comes to being cunning,

513
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:34,712
I'm afraid I outdo you

514
00:19:34,792 --> 00:19:36,072
by a century or so.

515
00:19:37,352 --> 00:19:38,632
Just remember one thing.

516
00:19:38,912 --> 00:19:40,511
Your aunt and I don't have any kids.

517
00:19:40,792 --> 00:19:41,792
Xiaojiao's parents

518
00:19:41,872 --> 00:19:43,271
have been working abroad for years.

519
00:19:43,511 --> 00:19:44,312
One could say

520
00:19:44,592 --> 00:19:45,431
that we've raised her

521
00:19:45,511 --> 00:19:47,271
since she was little.

522
00:19:47,471 --> 00:19:49,912
We've treated her like our own.

523
00:19:50,312 --> 00:19:51,592
If she's unhappy,

524
00:19:52,511 --> 00:19:53,751
then I'm unhappy.

525
00:19:58,191 --> 00:19:59,112
I understand, Uncle.

526
00:19:59,592 --> 00:20:00,511
Rest assured.

527
00:20:01,112 --> 00:20:02,392
I'll make Xiaojiao happy.

528
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:03,912
I'll drink first.

529
00:20:04,552 --> 00:20:05,992
We're doing well, Uncle.

530
00:20:06,072 --> 00:20:06,912
Don't worry.

531
00:20:08,031 --> 00:20:09,632
Don't fret unnecessarily, Uncle.

532
00:20:09,751 --> 00:20:10,431
Go ahead and eat.

533
00:20:10,511 --> 00:20:11,951
Don't make it so serious.

534
00:20:12,951 --> 00:20:13,871
Go ahead and eat.

535
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,031
Your cooking is great.

536
00:20:15,312 --> 00:20:16,152
Eat up.

537
00:20:16,991 --> 00:20:18,552
Here, Uncle, have a rib.

538
00:20:18,912 --> 00:20:20,032
Don't mind him.

539
00:20:20,112 --> 00:20:21,032
Just eat.

540
00:20:21,112 --> 00:20:22,111
You eat more too.

541
00:20:22,191 --> 00:20:23,312
I will.

542
00:20:31,191 --> 00:20:33,191
(Happy Cake Shop)
Suddenly, pie in the sky.

543
00:20:33,711 --> 00:20:36,031
I'm a bundle of nerves.

544
00:20:37,271 --> 00:20:38,191
A miser paid.

545
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,152
All would be shocked.

546
00:20:41,872 --> 00:20:43,392
Are you sure we can accept

547
00:20:43,671 --> 00:20:45,751
and use the Qian family's money?

548
00:20:46,231 --> 00:20:48,032
They're so full of schemes.

549
00:20:48,112 --> 00:20:49,592
I fear it's a trap.

550
00:20:50,431 --> 00:20:52,191
Of course we should use it.

551
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:53,792
Dami and Xiaomi

552
00:20:53,872 --> 00:20:55,191
are Qian Hao's kids too.

553
00:20:55,271 --> 00:20:57,032
It's his obligation
to pay child support.

554
00:20:57,112 --> 00:20:58,032
According to the court,

555
00:20:58,112 --> 00:21:00,352
it's 2,000 a month, 48,000 a year.

556
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:02,111
I've been divorced for four years.

557
00:21:02,191 --> 00:21:03,711
It's still far from enough.

558
00:21:04,231 --> 00:21:04,951
Besides,

559
00:21:05,031 --> 00:21:06,431
when we divorced back then,

560
00:21:06,511 --> 00:21:07,911
he transferred the assets

561
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:09,592
and even tricked me out of the house.

562
00:21:09,912 --> 00:21:10,431
I'll settle

563
00:21:10,511 --> 00:21:11,631
these with him later.

564
00:21:11,711 --> 00:21:12,751
Fair is fair.

565
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:14,312
Since they've paid child support,

566
00:21:14,592 --> 00:21:15,712
it's acceptable if they want

567
00:21:15,792 --> 00:21:16,832
to connect with the kids.

568
00:21:16,912 --> 00:21:17,431
Moreover,

569
00:21:17,511 --> 00:21:18,472
having a few more people

570
00:21:18,552 --> 00:21:20,711
in the world to love these two kids
is always good.

571
00:21:25,351 --> 00:21:29,368
(Happy Cake Shop)

572
00:21:55,352 --> 00:21:56,152
Chengyi.

573
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,431
It's so quiet.

574
00:21:59,312 --> 00:22:00,392
Mom, Dad, and the kids?

575
00:22:01,872 --> 00:22:03,031
This family is falling apart.

576
00:22:03,312 --> 00:22:04,312
Mom and Dad took the kids

577
00:22:04,392 --> 00:22:05,511
to the park.

578
00:22:10,671 --> 00:22:11,912
You don't seem right.

579
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:13,552
What happened?

580
00:22:13,991 --> 00:22:15,112
You fought with Dad again?

581
00:22:22,072 --> 00:22:23,231
Dad was right.

582
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,951
I'm just a failure.

583
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,312
What housekeeper?

584
00:22:27,872 --> 00:22:28,712
It's just an excuse

585
00:22:28,792 --> 00:22:29,792
I made for myself.

586
00:22:30,312 --> 00:22:31,792
If I applied for jobs,

587
00:22:32,191 --> 00:22:32,832
I'm afraid

588
00:22:32,912 --> 00:22:34,312
people wouldn't even employ me.

589
00:22:36,312 --> 00:22:38,112
In that case, I won't comfort you.

590
00:22:39,031 --> 00:22:40,631
You do need to go out

591
00:22:40,711 --> 00:22:41,991
and see the sunlight.

592
00:22:42,112 --> 00:22:43,391
You can't totally disconnect

593
00:22:43,471 --> 00:22:45,032
from society and isolate yourself.

594
00:22:45,112 --> 00:22:46,592
You came back from abroad.

595
00:22:47,072 --> 00:22:47,951
You've seen the world.

596
00:22:48,031 --> 00:22:49,112
And you're well-educated.

597
00:22:49,392 --> 00:22:51,431
It's not hard for you
to reintegrate into society.

598
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:54,751
Chengyi, do you know

599
00:22:55,872 --> 00:22:57,431
why I ended up like this?

600
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:05,592
It's your sister.

601
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:08,951
How do you know?

602
00:23:10,191 --> 00:23:11,592
I went through the same thing.

603
00:23:15,592 --> 00:23:16,232
I met her

604
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:17,591
when we were 19

605
00:23:17,671 --> 00:23:18,471
in college.

606
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:22,152
16 years have passed in a blink.

607
00:23:24,072 --> 00:23:25,751
Your sister was like a ray of light.

608
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:27,991
She was so gentle

609
00:23:29,231 --> 00:23:30,231
and so powerful.

610
00:23:33,031 --> 00:23:33,951
As you know,

611
00:23:34,471 --> 00:23:35,832
we were deeply in love.

612
00:23:37,231 --> 00:23:38,031
Then suddenly...

613
00:23:41,112 --> 00:23:42,511
I found it hard to move on as well.

614
00:23:44,711 --> 00:23:46,312
But I still have Yu'an and Yule.

615
00:23:46,552 --> 00:23:48,191
No matter what, I must stand up.

616
00:23:52,751 --> 00:23:53,751
You're right.

617
00:23:55,552 --> 00:23:59,552
My sister had always been like
a ray of light.

618
00:24:00,312 --> 00:24:01,912
She seemed to be always

619
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,511
living diligently

620
00:24:03,951 --> 00:24:05,112
and loving diligently.

621
00:24:06,991 --> 00:24:07,712
My parents

622
00:24:07,792 --> 00:24:09,392
always preferred my sister.

623
00:24:09,592 --> 00:24:10,991
But I never got jealous.

624
00:24:12,031 --> 00:24:13,112
Because I know

625
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:15,312
my sister loved me a lot too.

626
00:24:19,832 --> 00:24:21,352
I just don't understand

627
00:24:21,991 --> 00:24:23,631
why someone who lived so diligently

628
00:24:23,711 --> 00:24:25,351
would end up like this.

629
00:24:25,431 --> 00:24:26,032
Then what's

630
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,312
the point of me trying?

631
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:30,112
People are going to die anyways.

632
00:24:30,431 --> 00:24:31,312
I might as well

633
00:24:31,711 --> 00:24:33,552
just do what I want

634
00:24:33,951 --> 00:24:35,031
and not settle.

635
00:24:40,792 --> 00:24:42,152
Think about it from another angle.

636
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:45,191
Since you're going to die anyways,

637
00:24:45,431 --> 00:24:46,431
why not do

638
00:24:46,511 --> 00:24:47,751
what you want to do?

639
00:24:48,711 --> 00:24:49,472
I just don't know

640
00:24:49,552 --> 00:24:50,912
what I like

641
00:24:51,312 --> 00:24:52,431
or what I want to do.

642
00:24:53,031 --> 00:24:54,632
Then go find out.

643
00:24:55,711 --> 00:24:57,392
At least you have to go out first.

644
00:24:58,152 --> 00:24:59,032
Your sister and you

645
00:24:59,112 --> 00:24:59,752
are different.

646
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:00,712
If you do miss her,

647
00:25:00,792 --> 00:25:02,031
go out and walk around.

648
00:25:02,471 --> 00:25:03,312
Go see the places

649
00:25:03,392 --> 00:25:04,591
she once liked for her.

650
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:05,792
Won't that be great?

651
00:25:15,632 --> 00:25:16,312
See?

652
00:25:16,392 --> 00:25:17,951
My uncle is good to us, right?

653
00:25:18,112 --> 00:25:19,871
He's tough on the outside
and soft inside.

654
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:21,312
He keeps nagging.

655
00:25:21,392 --> 00:25:22,472
But we got the certificate

656
00:25:22,552 --> 00:25:23,912
pretty soon.

657
00:25:24,072 --> 00:25:25,632
We must properly thank my uncle.

658
00:25:30,951 --> 00:25:31,711
Are you happy?

659
00:25:37,592 --> 00:25:39,392
You park the car.
I'll wait for you here.

660
00:25:47,152 --> 00:25:48,231
What are you doing?

661
00:25:48,991 --> 00:25:50,031
I'm going to my mom's.

662
00:25:51,152 --> 00:25:52,032
Then I'll go with you.

663
00:25:52,112 --> 00:25:52,951
No.

664
00:25:53,031 --> 00:25:54,111
My mom speaks harshly.

665
00:25:54,191 --> 00:25:54,951
If she upsets you,

666
00:25:55,031 --> 00:25:56,431
it will upset your uncle.

667
00:25:59,152 --> 00:25:59,951
Qian Hao!

668
00:26:00,152 --> 00:26:01,792
Are you kicking me away like a ladder?

669
00:26:04,552 --> 00:26:06,031
I won't stoop to your level.

670
00:26:06,912 --> 00:26:07,711
Chengyi,

671
00:26:08,431 --> 00:26:09,871
did they ask you to bring your date

672
00:26:09,951 --> 00:26:11,392
here for dinner this weekend?

673
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:14,312
They said another weekend.

674
00:26:15,152 --> 00:26:15,911
Don't worry.

675
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:17,031
I've got everything ready.

676
00:26:17,352 --> 00:26:18,032
I found a friend

677
00:26:18,112 --> 00:26:19,711
who studies acting to act for me.

678
00:26:20,552 --> 00:26:21,312
It's free.

679
00:26:22,392 --> 00:26:23,632
It's not that simple.

680
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:25,072
When you went out on a date,

681
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,711
my dad's colleague took a photo of you.

682
00:26:27,072 --> 00:26:28,232
To not be exposed,

683
00:26:28,312 --> 00:26:29,232
you'll have to get

684
00:26:29,312 --> 00:26:30,751
that woman from that day.

685
00:26:31,352 --> 00:26:32,152
What?

686
00:26:32,872 --> 00:26:33,711
That woman?

687
00:26:34,431 --> 00:26:35,552
She has to act.

688
00:26:47,271 --> 00:26:48,552
Mom, Lili,

689
00:26:48,632 --> 00:26:49,352
you're back.

690
00:26:49,511 --> 00:26:50,351
Xiaomi is asleep.

691
00:26:50,431 --> 00:26:51,631
Dami, why are you at home?

692
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:52,472
Didn't you say

693
00:26:52,552 --> 00:26:54,392
you'd stay at your dad's for a few days?

694
00:26:55,912 --> 00:26:57,232
Dad said he has something to do

695
00:26:57,312 --> 00:26:57,951
and told me

696
00:26:58,031 --> 00:26:59,392
to come back before going back.

697
00:27:01,231 --> 00:27:02,351
Mom, I didn't lie to you.

698
00:27:02,431 --> 00:27:03,111
There's money.

699
00:27:03,191 --> 00:27:04,152
I've checked.

700
00:27:04,431 --> 00:27:05,712
I've brought back the gifts too.

701
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:06,512
There's a lot.

702
00:27:06,592 --> 00:27:08,112
Alright, let's talk outside.

703
00:27:12,792 --> 00:27:13,431
Dad,

704
00:27:13,511 --> 00:27:14,032
do you

705
00:27:14,112 --> 00:27:15,592
need our help with anything?

706
00:27:16,072 --> 00:27:17,152
You two, come here.

707
00:27:17,431 --> 00:27:18,272
Take cleaning cloths

708
00:27:18,352 --> 00:27:19,751
and go clean the table.

709
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:24,072
Come on.

710
00:27:24,152 --> 00:27:25,552
I will pick them up for you.

711
00:27:25,751 --> 00:27:26,328
Okay.

712
00:27:26,991 --> 00:27:28,991
Look at these two little ingrates.

713
00:27:30,152 --> 00:27:32,471
You bully me when you're with me.

714
00:27:33,031 --> 00:27:34,072
But in front of your dad,

715
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:35,752
you're as obedient

716
00:27:35,832 --> 00:27:37,752
as two little rabbits.

717
00:27:37,832 --> 00:27:40,352
You do housework
and don't wreck the place anymore.

718
00:27:42,592 --> 00:27:43,992
It really breaks my heart

719
00:27:44,072 --> 00:27:45,671
to pieces.

720
00:27:48,152 --> 00:27:49,632
Chengyi, don't worry.

721
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:51,072
Listen.

722
00:27:51,392 --> 00:27:52,472
Just find an excuse.

723
00:27:52,552 --> 00:27:54,792
You can say she's on a business trip

724
00:27:55,112 --> 00:27:55,991
or she's sick.

725
00:27:56,231 --> 00:27:57,512
Just push this thing aside

726
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,632
for now.

727
00:28:00,031 --> 00:28:00,991
It's useless.

728
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,872
He's your dad.

729
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:06,352
Don't you know him?

730
00:28:07,231 --> 00:28:08,191
You can run,

731
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:09,431
but you can't hide.

732
00:28:09,912 --> 00:28:11,552
He'll know about this sooner or later.

733
00:28:11,671 --> 00:28:12,832
If he becomes suspicious,

734
00:28:13,152 --> 00:28:15,152
he'll drag us both along.

735
00:28:15,392 --> 00:28:16,832
Then there's only one solution.

736
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,792
Figure out a way

737
00:28:18,872 --> 00:28:20,471
to add that woman back on WeChat.

738
00:28:20,751 --> 00:28:22,792
And politely ask her.

739
00:28:23,511 --> 00:28:24,151
Alright.

740
00:28:24,231 --> 00:28:25,872
That's it.

741
00:28:26,711 --> 00:28:27,511
Eat some fruit.

742
00:28:28,112 --> 00:28:29,472
Alright, come quickly.

743
00:28:29,552 --> 00:28:30,632
Sweeties, hurry.

744
00:28:31,072 --> 00:28:31,792
Come quickly.

745
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,792
Eat some fruit.

746
00:28:36,711 --> 00:28:38,272
Lili, are you comfortable?

747
00:28:38,352 --> 00:28:39,832
I bought this especially for you.

748
00:28:40,431 --> 00:28:41,032
Didn't you say

749
00:28:41,112 --> 00:28:42,351
you were living with your dad?

750
00:28:42,431 --> 00:28:44,431
Mom, you're silly, but I'm not.

751
00:28:44,872 --> 00:28:46,431
Business is business.

752
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:47,472
But in the mall,

753
00:28:47,552 --> 00:28:48,671
you said differently.

754
00:28:48,751 --> 00:28:49,552
Ms. Hu Xiaojiao

755
00:28:49,632 --> 00:28:50,591
is my dad's new wife.

756
00:28:50,671 --> 00:28:52,112
You can't bully her.

757
00:28:52,511 --> 00:28:54,112
The main thing is to live.

758
00:28:54,552 --> 00:28:56,471
Money is certainly important,

759
00:28:56,711 --> 00:28:57,912
but being a person...

760
00:28:58,191 --> 00:28:59,032
Let me ask you again.

761
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,991
We need to live, right?

762
00:29:01,751 --> 00:29:02,512
Well said.

763
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,152
That's it.

764
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,991
Come back.

765
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:08,191
Did you tell your brother

766
00:29:08,392 --> 00:29:09,512
about all your wicked ideas?

767
00:29:09,592 --> 00:29:10,272
Sure.

768
00:29:10,352 --> 00:29:11,871
I have to worry about my whole family.

769
00:29:11,951 --> 00:29:13,472
Xiaomi is much smarter than you all.

770
00:29:13,552 --> 00:29:15,431
He learned and understood right away.

771
00:29:15,511 --> 00:29:16,792
Now she is cocky.

772
00:29:18,872 --> 00:29:20,112
Is this real or not?

773
00:29:23,112 --> 00:29:24,231
Every day,

774
00:29:24,951 --> 00:29:26,511
I take more pills than food.

775
00:29:30,951 --> 00:29:31,751
Mom,

776
00:29:33,671 --> 00:29:34,272
I think

777
00:29:34,352 --> 00:29:35,471
something is a bit off.

778
00:29:36,832 --> 00:29:37,632
What's wrong?

779
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:40,312
Hu Xiaojiao

780
00:29:40,392 --> 00:29:41,632
said something that is correct.

781
00:29:42,031 --> 00:29:43,671
We haven't gotten much,

782
00:29:43,751 --> 00:29:45,391
but tens of thousands are already spent.

783
00:29:45,471 --> 00:29:46,792
If it goes on like this,

784
00:29:46,872 --> 00:29:47,631
our family fortune

785
00:29:47,711 --> 00:29:48,431
will all be taken

786
00:29:48,511 --> 00:29:49,671
by Dami and Xiaomi.

787
00:29:50,191 --> 00:29:52,471
Hu Xiaojiao is up to no good.

788
00:29:53,152 --> 00:29:54,191
She can't have children.

789
00:29:54,271 --> 00:29:55,991
She's jealous of your father-kids bond.

790
00:29:57,671 --> 00:29:58,911
As for Xu Kaixin,

791
00:29:58,991 --> 00:30:00,312
you know her well.

792
00:30:00,392 --> 00:30:02,231
She's carefree and foolish.

793
00:30:02,392 --> 00:30:03,792
That's why she was made a fool of

794
00:30:03,872 --> 00:30:05,592
by you during the divorce.

795
00:30:05,832 --> 00:30:06,632
I...

796
00:30:08,872 --> 00:30:10,511
I'm not worried about Xu Kaixin now.

797
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:11,872
But don't forget

798
00:30:12,191 --> 00:30:13,031
Dami and Xiaomi

799
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:15,191
carry the blood of our family.

800
00:30:15,392 --> 00:30:16,191
They are sharp.

801
00:30:16,312 --> 00:30:17,792
I'm starting to realize now.

802
00:30:17,872 --> 00:30:19,271
I don't think they are simple.

803
00:30:19,792 --> 00:30:21,191
Isn't that right?

804
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:21,992
That shows

805
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:23,312
Xiaomi is clever.

806
00:30:23,392 --> 00:30:24,191
Right?

807
00:30:24,991 --> 00:30:26,431
Spending some money for my grandson

808
00:30:26,511 --> 00:30:27,951
is completely right.

809
00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:29,471
What's wrong with that, right?

810
00:30:31,031 --> 00:30:32,832
Given my illness,

811
00:30:32,912 --> 00:30:34,111
my days are counted.

812
00:30:34,191 --> 00:30:36,191
Money is just external possessions,

813
00:30:36,431 --> 00:30:36,991
isn't it?

814
00:30:37,392 --> 00:30:38,312
I'm thinking,

815
00:30:38,392 --> 00:30:39,512
how can the money

816
00:30:39,592 --> 00:30:41,431
be spent on Xiaomi?

817
00:30:41,592 --> 00:30:42,712
That's debatable.

818
00:30:42,792 --> 00:30:43,951
Spending some money is okay,

819
00:30:44,031 --> 00:30:45,552
but we need to change our approach.

820
00:30:45,632 --> 00:30:47,392
Never ante up without seeing the flop.

821
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,111
From now on,

822
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:49,992
before we get the custody

823
00:30:50,072 --> 00:30:51,271
of the kids,

824
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,832
we should always be careful
when spending more than 1,000.

825
00:30:56,031 --> 00:30:56,832
How about

826
00:30:57,312 --> 00:30:59,392
I go to talk to Xu Kaixin

827
00:30:59,552 --> 00:31:01,111
to see exactly how much money is needed

828
00:31:01,191 --> 00:31:02,631
for her to give Xiaomi to us.

829
00:31:02,711 --> 00:31:03,511
It's useless.

830
00:31:03,912 --> 00:31:05,392
I know Xu Kaixin the best.

831
00:31:05,832 --> 00:31:07,912
If money can really solve the problem,

832
00:31:08,031 --> 00:31:09,832
I can give her half of that condo.

833
00:31:10,271 --> 00:31:11,392
But once that woman

834
00:31:11,832 --> 00:31:13,231
becomes stubborn,

835
00:31:14,112 --> 00:31:14,912
she'll be tricky.

836
00:31:16,191 --> 00:31:17,592
I have to think of other ways.

837
00:31:18,552 --> 00:31:19,872
I have to make her feel that

838
00:31:20,152 --> 00:31:21,072
raising two kids alone

839
00:31:21,152 --> 00:31:22,191
is too much pressure

840
00:31:23,671 --> 00:31:24,871
to make her give the custody

841
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:26,512
to us for Xiaomi's future willingly.

842
00:31:26,592 --> 00:31:28,392
Okay, I will listen to you.

843
00:31:28,792 --> 00:31:30,511
As long as we can get Xiaomi,

844
00:31:30,711 --> 00:31:32,231
I will listen to you completely.

845
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:43,872
Look.

846
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:47,631
It's over 560,000.

847
00:31:47,711 --> 00:31:49,112
That's a lot of money.

848
00:31:49,392 --> 00:31:49,992
Well,

849
00:31:50,072 --> 00:31:51,992
I planned to work hard this year

850
00:31:52,072 --> 00:31:52,752
and save up

851
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,472
half a million by the end of the year.

852
00:31:54,552 --> 00:31:55,151
I didn't expect

853
00:31:55,231 --> 00:31:56,712
my kids would get the child support

854
00:31:56,792 --> 00:31:57,832
and accomplish my goal.

855
00:31:57,912 --> 00:31:59,072
Don't spend it recklessly.

856
00:31:59,632 --> 00:32:00,991
When it's spring next year,

857
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,032
the cake shop's rent

858
00:32:02,112 --> 00:32:03,191
will be a big expense.

859
00:32:03,271 --> 00:32:03,832
Also, we need

860
00:32:03,912 --> 00:32:05,431
to pay the rent for this place.

861
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:06,312
Well,

862
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:07,232
with so much money,

863
00:32:07,312 --> 00:32:08,671
should I buy a car

864
00:32:08,792 --> 00:32:10,632
or pay the down payment
for my own place?

865
00:32:12,392 --> 00:32:12,911
Can you

866
00:32:12,991 --> 00:32:14,392
help me decide?

867
00:32:15,191 --> 00:32:16,031
What are you doing?

868
00:32:20,552 --> 00:32:22,431
One, two, three, four, five...

869
00:32:22,912 --> 00:32:24,072
300,000?

870
00:32:24,191 --> 00:32:25,191
Wait,

871
00:32:25,552 --> 00:32:26,232
when did you

872
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:27,431
save so much money?

873
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:29,312
My retirement pension
has increased again.

874
00:32:29,392 --> 00:32:31,872
Besides, your cake shop
has been doing well these two years.

875
00:32:32,191 --> 00:32:33,272
So I invest less now.

876
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:35,031
And I still have my savings.

877
00:32:35,632 --> 00:32:36,752
So together we

878
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:38,511
have over 800,000?

879
00:32:39,072 --> 00:32:39,712
I feel like

880
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:42,031
I've suddenly become a rich woman.

881
00:32:43,112 --> 00:32:43,912
Rich woman.

882
00:32:44,072 --> 00:32:46,312
You can decide
how to use all this money.

883
00:32:46,792 --> 00:32:47,752
Let's buy a place.

884
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,471
Although over 800,000 isn't much,

885
00:32:49,711 --> 00:32:51,511
it should be enough
for a small two-bedroom.

886
00:32:52,152 --> 00:32:52,792
Wait,

887
00:32:52,872 --> 00:32:54,632
Dami said she wants a car.

888
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:56,512
She thinks she wouldn't get wet or cold

889
00:32:56,592 --> 00:32:58,072
when it rains or snows.

890
00:32:58,271 --> 00:32:59,151
She has a point.

891
00:32:59,231 --> 00:33:00,184
On the weekends,

892
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,711
I can also drive you out for fun.

893
00:33:01,872 --> 00:33:02,792
A two-bedroom

894
00:33:02,872 --> 00:33:03,871
isn't enough for us now.

895
00:33:03,951 --> 00:33:05,191
We can wait a little longer.

896
00:33:05,832 --> 00:33:06,431
Oh my.

897
00:33:06,511 --> 00:33:07,272
Well...

898
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:08,111
What is happening?

899
00:33:08,191 --> 00:33:09,792
How did I suddenly feel like,

900
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:11,712
you know,

901
00:33:11,792 --> 00:33:12,631
I've taken off?

902
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:13,671
And I'm

903
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:15,711
floating.

904
00:33:19,312 --> 00:33:20,112
Soon,

905
00:33:20,392 --> 00:33:21,312
the gingerbread man

906
00:33:21,392 --> 00:33:23,191
ran to the end of the lane

907
00:33:23,392 --> 00:33:25,231
and continued running along the fields.

908
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:27,552
A horse watched him run over

909
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:28,312
and shouted,

910
00:33:28,392 --> 00:33:30,191
"You smell so good.

911
00:33:30,471 --> 00:33:32,431
Don't run. Come back."

912
00:33:32,872 --> 00:33:34,792
The little gingerbread man
turned his head,

913
00:33:34,912 --> 00:33:36,232
smiling defiantly.

914
00:33:36,312 --> 00:33:39,072
He ran and ran and ran.

915
00:33:39,872 --> 00:33:42,392
The horse chased and chased
but couldn't catch up.

916
00:33:43,152 --> 00:33:46,471
The little gingerbread man
has swift legs.

I'm looking

943
00:36:22,392 --> 00:36:24,192
for a high-quality family partner.

944
00:36:26,991 --> 00:36:28,312
Family partner?

945
00:36:30,392 --> 00:36:32,192
A household partner is more like it.

946
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:47,631
Mom,

947
00:36:48,192 --> 00:36:49,351
I'll sleep here today.

948
00:36:49,431 --> 00:36:50,312
I'm not going back.

949
00:36:50,551 --> 00:36:51,272
What's wrong?

950
00:36:51,352 --> 00:36:52,712
Did you fight with Hu Xiaojiao?

951
00:36:53,431 --> 00:36:54,192
No.

952
00:36:54,431 --> 00:36:55,712
I just want some time alone.

953
00:36:56,712 --> 00:36:57,511
Okay.

954
00:36:57,792 --> 00:36:59,391
If Hu Xiaojiao asks you,

955
00:36:59,471 --> 00:37:00,792
tell her you're not feeling well,

956
00:37:00,872 --> 00:37:01,712
and I'm here for you.

957
00:37:01,792 --> 00:37:02,632
Don't slip up.

958
00:37:02,712 --> 00:37:03,712
She won't dare to ask me.

959
00:37:04,272 --> 00:37:05,631
If she asks me, I will say

960
00:37:06,192 --> 00:37:07,272
you don't want her anymore

961
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:08,312
and you go

962
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:09,631
to pursue some other woman.

963
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:12,272
There's no need for that.

964
00:37:12,951 --> 00:37:14,031
Come up with another line.

965
00:38:15,431 --> 00:38:16,232
It's so late.

966
00:38:18,792 --> 00:38:20,591
Don't be mad. Don't be mad.

967
00:38:20,872 --> 00:38:21,991
To maintain the marriage,

968
00:38:22,071 --> 00:38:23,031
we can't fight.

969
00:38:57,031 --> 00:38:57,832
Hello?

970
00:38:59,511 --> 00:39:00,312
Hello.

971
00:39:00,551 --> 00:39:02,112
Honey, where are you?

972
00:39:02,192 --> 00:39:03,431
I miss you.

973
00:39:05,071 --> 00:39:05,832
Well,

974
00:39:05,912 --> 00:39:08,912
my mom isn't feeling well today.

975
00:39:09,071 --> 00:39:10,951
I'm staying with her tonight.

976
00:39:11,031 --> 00:39:12,511
I'll go back tomorrow.

977
00:39:12,792 --> 00:39:13,991
Qian Hao, what do you mean?

978
00:39:14,631 --> 00:39:15,752
What do you think?

979
00:39:15,832 --> 00:39:17,591
Can't you understand a bit?

980
00:39:17,712 --> 00:39:18,712
You know about

981
00:39:18,792 --> 00:39:19,912
my mom's health condition.

982
00:39:20,031 --> 00:39:20,911
She's feeling unwell.

983
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:23,031
As her son,
can't I stay with her for a night?

984
00:39:23,511 --> 00:39:24,792
You tell me.

985
00:39:25,272 --> 00:39:26,511
Your daughter came

986
00:39:26,591 --> 00:39:27,232
and wanted you.

987
00:39:27,312 --> 00:39:28,592
You stayed with her for a night.

988
00:39:28,672 --> 00:39:29,792
Now your mom wants you.

989
00:39:29,872 --> 00:39:31,192
So you're staying with her.

990
00:39:31,272 --> 00:39:32,991
What about the days to come?

991
00:39:33,071 --> 00:39:34,232
Will you also stay

992
00:39:34,312 --> 00:39:35,712
with each of your relatives

993
00:39:35,792 --> 00:39:36,951
who feel unwell for a night?

994
00:39:37,031 --> 00:39:38,312
What do you mean?

995
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,551
You can stay

996
00:39:39,631 --> 00:39:41,431
with anyone but me, huh?

997
00:39:43,392 --> 00:39:43,911
Hu Xiaojiao,

998
00:39:43,991 --> 00:39:44,911
I'll make it clear.

999
00:39:44,991 --> 00:39:45,712
I want to stay

1000
00:39:45,792 --> 00:39:46,792
with anyone but you.

1001
00:39:46,872 --> 00:39:48,232
It's the same thing all day long.

1002
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:49,912
I've had enough of it.

1003
00:39:54,151 --> 00:39:55,832
Qian Hao, you're just a liar.

1004
00:39:55,912 --> 00:39:57,312
You told me

1005
00:39:57,591 --> 00:39:59,232
the doctor said you'd get better soon,

1006
00:39:59,312 --> 00:40:00,632
and you're stronger than before.

1007
00:40:00,712 --> 00:40:01,872
So it's all lies.

1008
00:40:02,111 --> 00:40:03,712
If you're sick, go get treatment.

1009
00:40:03,792 --> 00:40:04,391
Why are you

1010
00:40:04,471 --> 00:40:05,672
boasting all day?

1011
00:40:06,031 --> 00:40:06,552
Okay.

1012
00:40:06,951 --> 00:40:08,152
From now on,

1013
00:40:08,232 --> 00:40:09,272
I will never

1014
00:40:09,872 --> 00:40:11,551
let you touch me again.

1015
00:40:12,752 --> 00:40:13,631
What did you say?

1016
00:40:14,192 --> 00:40:14,991
Hello?

1017
00:40:17,672 --> 00:40:18,511
Never mind.

1018
00:40:18,591 --> 00:40:19,951
Go to whoever you like.

1019
00:40:53,192 --> 00:40:54,312
Good morning.

1020
00:40:59,431 --> 00:41:00,712
Why are you here?

1021
00:41:03,471 --> 00:41:04,872
Where did you go all night?

1022
00:41:05,272 --> 00:41:06,672
I couldn't reach you by phone.

1023
00:41:07,672 --> 00:41:08,391
You left me

1024
00:41:08,471 --> 00:41:09,951
alone at home.

1025
00:41:10,071 --> 00:41:11,631
Don't change the subject.

1026
00:41:12,031 --> 00:41:12,832
Where did you go?

1027
00:41:12,912 --> 00:41:13,672
With whom?

1028
00:41:21,031 --> 00:41:22,672
I went to see someone else.

1029
00:41:38,511 --> 00:41:39,832
You must be sick.

1030
00:41:41,511 --> 00:41:42,551
Don't do this ever again.

1031
00:41:42,631 --> 00:41:43,192
Understand?

1032
00:41:43,272 --> 00:41:44,792
I called you all night long

1033
00:41:44,872 --> 00:41:46,112
but couldn't get to you.

1034
00:41:46,192 --> 00:41:47,391
I didn't sleep all night.

1035
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:49,272
Do you know how worried I was?

1036
00:41:50,832 --> 00:41:51,951
I was not in a good mood.

1037
00:41:52,031 --> 00:41:53,712
I asked Kelly to have a drink.

1038
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:55,112
You have her number.

1039
00:41:55,192 --> 00:41:56,272
Call her and ask.

1040
00:41:56,912 --> 00:41:57,832
After I drank,

1041
00:41:57,912 --> 00:41:59,431
I didn't want to come home.

1042
00:41:59,872 --> 00:42:00,672
I was annoyed.

1043
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,071
What was I supposed to do alone at home?

1044
00:42:03,832 --> 00:42:05,672
I had nowhere to go late at night.

1045
00:42:05,752 --> 00:42:07,551
So I could only
go to see a late-night movie.

1046
00:42:07,631 --> 00:42:09,511
Kelly and I fell asleep there.

1047
00:42:09,872 --> 00:42:10,592
Honey,

1048
00:42:10,672 --> 00:42:11,511
do you know how I

1049
00:42:11,591 --> 00:42:12,672
woke up this morning?

1050
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:13,991
I was woken up

1051
00:42:14,071 --> 00:42:15,551
by the staff.

1052
00:42:15,672 --> 00:42:16,272
I sat

1053
00:42:16,352 --> 00:42:17,232
on a hard bench

1054
00:42:17,312 --> 00:42:18,272
and slept all night.

1055
00:42:18,352 --> 00:42:19,911
Now both my neck and back hurt.

1056
00:42:19,991 --> 00:42:21,272
I hurt everywhere.

1057
00:42:21,352 --> 00:42:22,712
You don't even feel sorry for me.

1058
00:42:22,792 --> 00:42:24,352
I feel sorry for you.

1059
00:42:25,471 --> 00:42:26,112
Listen to me.

1060
00:42:26,192 --> 00:42:27,792
No matter what you do in the future

1061
00:42:27,872 --> 00:42:28,592
or with whom,

1062
00:42:28,672 --> 00:42:30,312
you have to be reachable.

1063
00:42:30,392 --> 00:42:31,272
Got it?

1064
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,631
Do you know how worried I was?

1065
00:42:34,192 --> 00:42:35,471
If you upset me again,

1066
00:42:35,551 --> 00:42:37,111
I'll make sure you can't find me.

1067
00:42:37,631 --> 00:42:38,431
Try it again.

1068
00:42:41,471 --> 00:42:43,312
I'm taking a shower
and going back to sleep.

1069
00:42:43,752 --> 00:42:44,752
Go ahead.

1070
00:42:48,591 --> 00:42:49,392
Honey,

1071
00:42:51,111 --> 00:42:52,232
do you want to join me?

1072
00:42:52,912 --> 00:42:54,232
I'll go make breakfast for you.
