00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,264
You told him?

17
00:01:39,463 --> 00:01:40,463
What did he say?

18
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:42,223
He wanted to come over.

19
00:01:42,223 --> 00:01:43,344
But I told him not to.

20
00:01:43,663 --> 00:01:44,863
He should have come over.

21
00:01:44,984 --> 00:01:46,383
Why did he ask for permission?

22
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:48,863
He has two kids at home.

23
00:01:49,064 --> 00:01:50,663
Besides, he is busy with work.

24
00:01:50,863 --> 00:01:51,785
It only bothers you

25
00:01:51,785 --> 00:01:53,344
if you think that way.

26
00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,224
When did you

27
00:01:54,224 --> 00:01:55,424
become so understanding

28
00:01:55,424 --> 00:01:56,544
like a love coach?

29
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,583
I've noticed

30
00:01:58,583 --> 00:01:59,584
that most couples

31
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:00,704
and partners

32
00:02:00,784 --> 00:02:02,463
have conflicts and disputes

33
00:02:02,463 --> 00:02:03,104
because they

34
00:02:03,104 --> 00:02:04,503
have low expectations of themselves

35
00:02:04,503 --> 00:02:06,103
and too high expectations of others.

36
00:02:06,103 --> 00:02:07,544
And they want the others

37
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,783
to take the burdens they carry.

38
00:02:08,783 --> 00:02:09,944
Once expectations are unmet,

39
00:02:10,104 --> 00:02:11,583
they become deeply disappointed.

40
00:02:11,984 --> 00:02:13,384
A partner

41
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:15,063
is life's bonus.

42
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:16,304
If they can share

43
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:17,504
some of your stress,

44
00:02:17,504 --> 00:02:18,265
it's great.

45
00:02:18,265 --> 00:02:19,704
It's an unexpected surprise.

46
00:02:19,704 --> 00:02:20,903
If they can't,

47
00:02:20,903 --> 00:02:22,343
it's not a big deal.

48
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:23,783
After all, it's your own business.

49
00:02:24,903 --> 00:02:26,343
You're quite open-minded.

50
00:02:26,664 --> 00:02:27,704
With no demands at all,

51
00:02:27,903 --> 00:02:29,385
what's the point of having a partner?

52
00:02:29,385 --> 00:02:31,384
I can only say
it's a personal preference.

53
00:02:31,623 --> 00:02:32,783
When you're single,

54
00:02:32,783 --> 00:02:33,824
you look for a thrill.

55
00:02:33,824 --> 00:02:34,825
Once you've had enough,

56
00:02:34,825 --> 00:02:36,183
you want to be alone quietly.

57
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:37,343
The needs change.

58
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:39,583
Alright.

59
00:02:39,704 --> 00:02:40,743
You feel like a thrill.

60
00:02:41,343 --> 00:02:42,424
Let's eat. I'm starving.

61
00:02:42,424 --> 00:02:43,064
Let's eat.

62
00:02:43,064 --> 00:02:44,944
Xiaomi, let's go eat.

63
00:02:44,944 --> 00:02:46,384
I don't want Ms. Xiaoxiao.

64
00:02:46,384 --> 00:02:47,105
I want my mom.

65
00:02:47,105 --> 00:02:48,704
Alright, come to Mom.

66
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,623
You go to Dad. I want Mom.

67
00:02:50,623 --> 00:02:51,504
Mom is mine.

68
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:52,264
You want Mom too?

69
00:02:52,264 --> 00:02:52,985
I don't want Dami.

70
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:54,583
Mom is here. You can both come to me.

71
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:55,105
Alright.

72
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:56,144
I want to eat too.

73
00:03:00,783 --> 00:03:01,944
Wait for me.

74
00:03:18,504 --> 00:03:19,303
Youyou.

75
00:03:19,504 --> 00:03:21,063
Hurry up. We're waiting for you.

76
00:03:21,264 --> 00:03:22,264
I'm coming.

77
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,224
Hurry up.

78
00:03:24,224 --> 00:03:25,224
Look.

79
00:03:25,783 --> 00:03:27,264
All are what you like to eat.

80
00:03:27,264 --> 00:03:27,904
Right.

81
00:03:27,904 --> 00:03:29,343
Come on, sweetie.

82
00:03:30,704 --> 00:03:31,743
Thank you, Mom.

83
00:03:32,104 --> 00:03:33,104
Here.

84
00:03:33,264 --> 00:03:34,783
This is the preserved egg you like.

85
00:03:34,783 --> 00:03:36,264
Thank you, Dad.

86
00:03:36,264 --> 00:03:37,184
Hurry up and eat.

87
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,783
Kids, hurry and eat.

88
00:03:39,104 --> 00:03:40,384
Eat by yourselves.

89
00:03:42,343 --> 00:03:43,343
Youyou,

90
00:03:44,104 --> 00:03:45,183
let's talk

91
00:03:45,183 --> 00:03:46,183
about your work.

92
00:03:46,504 --> 00:03:47,944
How does your boss treat you?

93
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,063
How do you get along with colleagues?

94
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:52,623
Quite good. It's all good.

95
00:03:52,743 --> 00:03:54,144
The boss takes good care of me.

96
00:03:54,384 --> 00:03:56,104
And my colleagues don't talk much.

97
00:03:56,104 --> 00:03:57,424
Everyone does their own work.

98
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,824
Okay.

99
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:01,063
Do you have a business card?

100
00:04:01,343 --> 00:04:02,384
Give me one.

101
00:04:04,343 --> 00:04:05,265
Nowadays,

102
00:04:05,265 --> 00:04:06,504
we don't use business cards.

103
00:04:06,504 --> 00:04:07,783
Now it's all electronic.

104
00:04:07,783 --> 00:04:09,224
Electronic ones are fine too.

105
00:04:09,224 --> 00:04:10,544
Send one to me.

106
00:04:11,144 --> 00:04:12,144
Come on.

107
00:04:14,183 --> 00:04:15,463
I'm still interning.

108
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,184
I'll send you one

109
00:04:16,184 --> 00:04:17,223
when my internship ends.

110
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:18,223
Here.

111
00:04:19,463 --> 00:04:21,023
I don't like this.

112
00:04:21,983 --> 00:04:23,543
Kids shouldn't be picky about food.

113
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,864
Adults eat whatever they want.

114
00:04:25,864 --> 00:04:27,184
Of course, they aren't picky.

115
00:04:27,944 --> 00:04:28,744
Alright.

116
00:04:28,864 --> 00:04:30,624
Let them eat whatever they like.

117
00:04:31,384 --> 00:04:32,824
So Yu'an, what do you like to eat?

118
00:04:32,824 --> 00:04:33,824
I will feed you.

119
00:04:34,223 --> 00:04:34,864
This.

120
00:04:34,864 --> 00:04:35,344
This?

121
00:04:35,344 --> 00:04:37,064
Okay, I will feed you.

122
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:39,223
Can you stop pampering her?

123
00:04:39,384 --> 00:04:40,463
She can eat by herself.

124
00:04:40,903 --> 00:04:42,583
I haven't been back for a long time.

125
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,505
I really miss them.

126
00:04:43,505 --> 00:04:46,023
I am just showing my care for them.

127
00:04:52,343 --> 00:04:53,343
Youyou,

128
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,144
is your boss a man or a woman?

129
00:04:56,783 --> 00:04:57,864
A man.

130
00:04:58,704 --> 00:04:59,783
What exactly

131
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:01,583
do you do at work?

132
00:05:07,064 --> 00:05:09,103
What exactly do I do at work?

133
00:05:09,783 --> 00:05:10,624
Right.

134
00:05:10,704 --> 00:05:12,903
What exactly do you do?

135
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:15,264
What exactly do I do?

136
00:05:24,343 --> 00:05:25,663
Dad, Mom,

137
00:05:26,824 --> 00:05:27,824
well,

138
00:05:31,783 --> 00:05:32,543
I'm leaving now.

139
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,543
I have things to do.

140
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,184
I'll come back later to pick them up.

141
00:05:35,184 --> 00:05:36,304
You're leaving now?

142
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:37,744
You haven't finished eating.

143
00:05:37,744 --> 00:05:39,023
I'm full.

144
00:05:39,023 --> 00:05:39,304
Bye.

145
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:39,984
Eat more.

146
00:05:39,984 --> 00:05:41,223
No, I'm leaving now.

147
00:05:41,624 --> 00:05:42,704
In such a hurry?

148
00:05:50,824 --> 00:05:51,983
Is Chengyi okay?

149
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,103
Yu'an, you like to eat fish, right?

150
00:06:00,103 --> 00:06:01,583
I'll pick out the fish bones for you.

151
00:06:04,304 --> 00:06:05,583
Here, Yu'an.

152
00:06:39,184 --> 00:06:40,184
Dad.

153
00:06:40,783 --> 00:06:42,184
Aren't you going to see Xiaojiao?

154
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:50,744
Maybe

155
00:06:51,624 --> 00:06:52,624
you should get divorced.

156
00:06:55,504 --> 00:06:57,304
If you can't make it work,
don't force it.

157
00:06:58,944 --> 00:07:00,423
Don't be like your mom and me.

158
00:07:01,663 --> 00:07:03,384
We tortured each other our whole lives.

159
00:07:05,463 --> 00:07:07,064
If everything could start over,

160
00:07:08,463 --> 00:07:10,463
I wouldn't choose this marriage again.

161
00:07:11,624 --> 00:07:12,384
Maybe

162
00:07:12,583 --> 00:07:14,264
ending this mistake earlier

163
00:07:15,384 --> 00:07:17,184
would be a relief for both her and me.

164
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,264
My mom is lying inside,

165
00:07:23,704 --> 00:07:24,864
and she is dying.

166
00:07:26,264 --> 00:07:27,343
By saying all this,

167
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:28,864
don't you feel ashamed?

168
00:07:31,663 --> 00:07:32,505
This is what

169
00:07:32,505 --> 00:07:33,824
has trapped me for life.

170
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,624
Actually,

171
00:07:40,184 --> 00:07:41,704
your mom is the same.

172
00:07:43,423 --> 00:07:44,423
Maybe,

173
00:07:44,704 --> 00:07:46,184
she has already figured it out.

174
00:07:46,824 --> 00:07:48,023
It's too boring.

175
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:53,824
Even if you'll get divorced,

176
00:07:55,304 --> 00:07:57,384
my mom has to be the one proposing it.

177
00:07:58,983 --> 00:08:00,783
Otherwise, don't even think about it.

178
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:32,504
Nurse, be gentle.

179
00:08:38,543 --> 00:08:39,543
It hurts.

180
00:08:39,984 --> 00:08:41,384
An injection is supposed to hurt.

181
00:08:41,384 --> 00:08:42,184
You have to

182
00:08:42,184 --> 00:08:43,823
get a progesterone shot every day.

183
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:44,824
Always being like this,

184
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,063
you can't keep the baby.

185
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:46,985
Be tough.

186
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:48,183
Being this delicate won't do.

187
00:08:49,104 --> 00:08:49,664
Slow down.

188
00:08:49,664 --> 00:08:51,104
Alright, press it yourself.

189
00:08:51,104 --> 00:08:52,104
Are we done?

190
00:09:06,783 --> 00:09:08,063
Why is there another shot?

191
00:09:11,703 --> 00:09:13,663
It hurts too much.

192
00:09:22,303 --> 00:09:23,344
Sir.

193
00:09:23,344 --> 00:09:24,303
Have some water.

194
00:09:24,303 --> 00:09:24,824
Thank you.

195
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:26,224
This is my business card.

196
00:09:27,864 --> 00:09:28,784
Which area

197
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:30,023
would you like to know about?

198
00:09:30,144 --> 00:09:30,865
May I ask

199
00:09:30,865 --> 00:09:32,104
if there is any place

200
00:09:32,303 --> 00:09:34,183
for rental in Building 39
in the community

201
00:09:34,384 --> 00:09:35,384
across the street?

202
00:09:35,823 --> 00:09:37,023
Got it, sir.

203
00:09:37,264 --> 00:09:39,023
How big do you want it to be?

204
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,920
Three-bedroom one with a living room.

205
00:09:41,144 --> 00:09:43,303
The closer to Building 9, the better.

206
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:44,505
Alright.

207
00:09:44,505 --> 00:09:46,423
Can you come see the house today?

208
00:09:46,543 --> 00:09:47,303
Sure.

209
00:09:47,303 --> 00:09:48,184
I can pay the deposit

210
00:09:48,184 --> 00:09:49,624
for a right place today.

211
00:09:49,744 --> 00:09:51,183
Okay, please wait a moment.

212
00:09:51,183 --> 00:09:52,504
I'll go check first.

213
00:09:52,504 --> 00:09:52,744
Okay.

214
00:09:52,744 --> 00:09:53,823
Please wait a moment.

215
00:09:53,823 --> 00:09:54,823
Thank you.

216
00:09:55,504 --> 00:09:56,504
Thank you.

217
00:09:59,584 --> 00:10:00,584
Time to eat.

218
00:10:03,543 --> 00:10:04,823
Wash your hands first.

219
00:10:06,823 --> 00:10:07,624
Dami,

220
00:10:07,823 --> 00:10:08,903
take Xiaomi to wash hands.

221
00:10:13,423 --> 00:10:14,145
Can young kids

222
00:10:14,145 --> 00:10:15,224
eat takeout?

223
00:10:15,224 --> 00:10:16,584
Haven't you heard?

224
00:10:16,943 --> 00:10:18,423
First kid by the book,

225
00:10:18,423 --> 00:10:19,624
second kid by instinct.

226
00:10:20,303 --> 00:10:21,624
Occasional takeout is fine.

227
00:10:21,624 --> 00:10:23,264
Don't stress about it

228
00:10:23,264 --> 00:10:24,624
as if it's toxic.

229
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:25,385
It's a matter

230
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:26,703
of just several meals.

231
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:27,864
I wouldn't ask Lili

232
00:10:27,864 --> 00:10:28,864
to bring food over.

233
00:10:31,264 --> 00:10:32,783
When the kids fall asleep later,

234
00:10:32,984 --> 00:10:33,944
we can talk

235
00:10:33,944 --> 00:10:35,183
about the thing bothering you.

236
00:10:41,104 --> 00:10:42,903
How do you know
something is bothering me?

237
00:10:46,144 --> 00:10:47,423
When I saw you,

238
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,023
your droopy face

239
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,464
gave you away immediately.

240
00:10:53,264 --> 00:10:54,464
Is it because of Song Ran?

241
00:10:56,264 --> 00:10:57,903
It's my bestie who understand me best

242
00:10:57,903 --> 00:10:59,384
and feel sorry for me the most.

243
00:10:59,703 --> 00:11:00,664
Men only affect my speed

244
00:11:00,664 --> 00:11:01,984
of becoming a rich woman.

245
00:11:03,144 --> 00:11:04,144
Your shoe!

246
00:11:04,783 --> 00:11:05,303
I was wrong.

247
00:11:05,303 --> 00:11:05,903
I was wrong.

248
00:11:05,903 --> 00:11:06,903
I was wrong.

249
00:11:07,063 --> 00:11:08,104
Sir,

250
00:11:08,104 --> 00:11:09,384
take a look at these ones.

251
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:11,384
Look.

252
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:12,345
You know the area,

253
00:11:12,345 --> 00:11:13,384
so I'll cut to the chase.

254
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,225
These places

255
00:11:14,225 --> 00:11:15,344
are upstairs from you.

256
00:11:15,344 --> 00:11:15,985
Look.

257
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:17,264
This one is at the top floor.

258
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:18,024
And

259
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:19,384
this one is on the13th floor.

260
00:11:19,384 --> 00:11:20,384
There's also a small one.

261
00:11:20,504 --> 00:11:21,744
The decoration is similar.

262
00:11:21,744 --> 00:11:22,505
But in rent,

263
00:11:22,505 --> 00:11:23,663
the biggest gap is 500 yuan.

264
00:11:23,823 --> 00:11:24,625
I'm strongly

265
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:25,984
recommend the top floor one.

266
00:11:25,984 --> 00:11:26,944
It has

267
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:28,344
a small open balcony.

268
00:11:28,344 --> 00:11:29,104
Just imagine that.

269
00:11:29,104 --> 00:11:30,105
After you tidy it up,

270
00:11:30,105 --> 00:11:31,543
you can sit here after work

271
00:11:31,543 --> 00:11:32,984
and have a glass of wine.

272
00:11:33,224 --> 00:11:34,224
It's so romantic.

273
00:11:34,504 --> 00:11:36,864
Is there a lower-floor option?

274
00:11:37,023 --> 00:11:38,703
Because we have kids with us.

275
00:11:39,104 --> 00:11:40,064
We place

276
00:11:40,064 --> 00:11:41,823
great importance on safety.

277
00:11:42,023 --> 00:11:43,063
You have kids?

278
00:11:43,144 --> 00:11:44,183
Understood.

279
00:11:44,264 --> 00:11:45,864
There are lower-floor options too.

280
00:11:46,703 --> 00:11:48,543
If you have time,

281
00:11:48,543 --> 00:11:50,104
I'll take you to see the place.

282
00:11:50,104 --> 00:11:51,584
No problem for me.

283
00:11:53,423 --> 00:11:54,224
Sir,

284
00:11:54,384 --> 00:11:55,703
take a look at this place.

285
00:11:55,703 --> 00:11:56,184
This place

286
00:11:56,184 --> 00:11:57,264
is much bigger.

287
00:11:57,264 --> 00:11:59,224
It's almost 150 square meters.

288
00:11:59,703 --> 00:12:00,903
Look at this kitchen.

289
00:12:01,504 --> 00:12:02,624
It has sliding doors.

290
00:12:02,624 --> 00:12:04,063
You can cook with gas.

291
00:12:04,144 --> 00:12:05,303
The range hood and others

292
00:12:05,303 --> 00:12:06,303
are new.

293
00:12:07,464 --> 00:12:08,064
And

294
00:12:08,064 --> 00:12:09,864
the bedrooms are over here.

295
00:12:10,224 --> 00:12:11,943
There are three bedrooms.

296
00:12:11,943 --> 00:12:12,865
The master bedroom

297
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,224
has an en-suite bathroom.

298
00:12:14,224 --> 00:12:15,624
There's also a bathroom here.

299
00:12:15,624 --> 00:12:16,864
Both have dry-wet separation.

300
00:12:18,543 --> 00:12:19,345
The biggest

301
00:12:19,345 --> 00:12:20,504
selling point

302
00:12:20,504 --> 00:12:21,783
is its high cost-effectiveness.

303
00:12:22,144 --> 00:12:24,224
The surrounding facilities
are very complete.

304
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:26,022
And the rent

305
00:12:26,022 --> 00:12:27,183
is negotiable.

306
00:12:27,344 --> 00:12:28,344
What do you think?

307
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:31,823
Pretty good.

308
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:32,823
Right?

309
00:12:34,104 --> 00:12:35,384
Can we see others?

310
00:12:36,063 --> 00:12:37,903
If you want to see,

311
00:12:37,903 --> 00:12:38,584
there's one more.

312
00:12:38,584 --> 00:12:39,265
I think you might

313
00:12:39,265 --> 00:12:40,303
be more satisfied with it.

314
00:12:40,303 --> 00:12:41,464
Okay, let's take a look.

315
00:12:41,663 --> 00:12:42,663
Okay.

316
00:12:45,624 --> 00:12:46,823
You know what?

317
00:12:46,823 --> 00:12:48,423
I bet you'll like this place.

318
00:12:48,423 --> 00:12:49,264
Look.

319
00:12:49,264 --> 00:12:50,184
Its layout is

320
00:12:50,184 --> 00:12:51,504
similar to that of your place.

321
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:53,464
The landlord went abroad.

322
00:12:53,663 --> 00:12:55,023
And the rent is also reasonable.

323
00:12:59,224 --> 00:13:00,464
It's a bedroom there.

324
00:13:02,984 --> 00:13:03,984
This is a bathroom.

325
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:07,584
I'll take some pictures.

326
00:13:22,063 --> 00:13:23,063
Good.

327
00:13:35,063 --> 00:13:36,183
Dami, why don't you eat?

328
00:13:41,264 --> 00:13:42,264
What's wrong?

329
00:13:52,543 --> 00:13:53,344
What are the photos

330
00:13:53,344 --> 00:13:54,344
you sent about?

331
00:13:54,823 --> 00:13:56,144
The place I found for you.

332
00:13:56,408 --> 00:13:57,903
Three-bedroom one with a living room.

333
00:13:58,023 --> 00:13:59,624
There's another one on the top floor

334
00:13:59,624 --> 00:14:01,063
with an open balcony.

335
00:14:01,063 --> 00:14:02,064
But I think

336
00:14:02,064 --> 00:14:03,224
it's too dangerous for kids

337
00:14:03,224 --> 00:14:04,303
to run around up there.

338
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:05,584
I think this one is quite good.

339
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:06,584
What do you think?

340
00:14:06,984 --> 00:14:08,744
You've found a place so quickly?

341
00:14:08,903 --> 00:14:09,465
Right.

342
00:14:09,465 --> 00:14:10,504
I'm worried about Qian Hao

343
00:14:10,504 --> 00:14:11,303
harassing you.

344
00:14:11,303 --> 00:14:12,023
Be close to me,

345
00:14:12,023 --> 00:14:12,943
so I can protect you.

346
00:14:12,943 --> 00:14:13,943
Right?

347
00:14:16,703 --> 00:14:17,703
Mei Chengyi.

348
00:14:19,823 --> 00:14:20,823
Mei Chengyi.

349
00:14:23,023 --> 00:14:23,943
Mei Chengyi.

350
00:14:24,023 --> 00:14:24,984
What's wrong?

351
00:14:24,984 --> 00:14:25,984
Are you not satisfied?

352
00:14:26,183 --> 00:14:27,303
Then I'll keep looking.

353
00:14:27,303 --> 00:14:28,303
No.

354
00:14:28,464 --> 00:14:29,464
I do like it.

355
00:14:30,303 --> 00:14:31,584
I just wanted to call you.

356
00:14:32,384 --> 00:14:33,744
Well,

357
00:14:33,744 --> 00:14:34,903
then I'll nail the deal.

358
00:14:34,903 --> 00:14:36,744
I'll first pay the agency fee

359
00:14:36,744 --> 00:14:37,744
and the deposit.

360
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:40,183
I'll pay my rent myself.

361
00:14:40,543 --> 00:14:42,423
After all, we're just partners.

362
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:42,985
In this way,

363
00:14:42,985 --> 00:14:44,624
I'll pay the deposit first.

364
00:14:44,624 --> 00:14:46,063
I'll find some cleaning ladies

365
00:14:46,063 --> 00:14:46,663
to clean it.

366
00:14:46,663 --> 00:14:47,384
I'll help you

367
00:14:47,384 --> 00:14:48,384
move when you're free.

368
00:14:48,624 --> 00:14:50,023
Alright, I'll call you later.

369
00:14:51,823 --> 00:14:52,823
Bye.

370
00:14:56,984 --> 00:14:57,984
Mei Chengyi.

371
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,303
Mei Chengyi.

372
00:14:59,464 --> 00:15:00,424
Mei Chengyi.

373
00:15:00,424 --> 00:15:02,104
I just wanted to call you.

374
00:15:03,264 --> 00:15:04,504
When did you get so gross?

375
00:15:04,984 --> 00:15:05,784
It's the art

376
00:15:05,784 --> 00:15:07,104
of acting cute. Work on yours.

377
00:15:08,663 --> 00:15:09,984
Why is Dami upset?

378
00:15:11,584 --> 00:15:13,023
She feels wronged.

379
00:15:16,144 --> 00:15:17,144
Qian Hao and his family

380
00:15:17,144 --> 00:15:18,144
are outrageous.

381
00:15:19,224 --> 00:15:20,703
Are you still going to the hospital?

382
00:15:22,663 --> 00:15:23,663
Yes.

383
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,303
After all, she is their grandma.

384
00:15:26,823 --> 00:15:27,943
People like Qian Hao

385
00:15:27,943 --> 00:15:28,984
will only advance further

386
00:15:28,984 --> 00:15:30,344
you take a step back.

387
00:15:30,543 --> 00:15:31,823
I'm not stepping back for him.

388
00:15:32,543 --> 00:15:34,183
Now I'm stepping back for myself.

389
00:15:35,344 --> 00:15:36,423
In the past two years,

390
00:15:36,423 --> 00:15:38,303
the kids' grandma
couldn't care less about them.

391
00:15:38,783 --> 00:15:40,303
But they are still young.

392
00:15:41,303 --> 00:15:42,903
They don't have their own judgment yet.

393
00:15:43,464 --> 00:15:44,504
I'm afraid

394
00:15:45,104 --> 00:15:46,384
they'll regret it in the future.

395
00:15:48,943 --> 00:15:50,183
My intuition tells me

396
00:15:50,584 --> 00:15:52,543
that Qian Hao
will definitely push his limits.

397
00:15:52,543 --> 00:15:54,344
He won't stop until he gets Xiaomi.

398
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,423
Well, I'm not

399
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:58,703
to be underestimated now.

400
00:16:02,943 --> 00:16:03,703
Sir,

401
00:16:03,703 --> 00:16:04,304
I need

402
00:16:04,304 --> 00:16:05,344
to tell you something.

403
00:16:05,543 --> 00:16:07,303
The landlord of this place
wants at least

404
00:16:07,303 --> 00:16:09,104
one month's upfront
and six months' rent.

405
00:16:09,104 --> 00:16:10,344
And if you pay annually,

406
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:10,943
you can have

407
00:16:10,943 --> 00:16:11,943
200 yuan off per month.

408
00:16:11,943 --> 00:16:12,823
What do you think?

409
00:16:12,823 --> 00:16:13,624
No problem.

410
00:16:13,624 --> 00:16:13,984
Okay.

411
00:16:13,984 --> 00:16:14,984
Dad.

412
00:16:16,423 --> 00:16:17,224
Chengyi.

413
00:16:17,224 --> 00:16:18,224
Dad.

414
00:16:19,384 --> 00:16:20,504
What is this for?

415
00:16:21,464 --> 00:16:22,000
It's nothing.

416
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,248
(Property Rental Agent)
How about you take the kids back first?

417
00:16:24,248 --> 00:16:25,144
I'll tell you later.

418
00:16:26,384 --> 00:16:28,104
Go back with Grandpa.

419
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:35,063
Okay, turn around.

420
00:16:35,063 --> 00:16:36,183
Slowly retract.

421
00:16:36,504 --> 00:16:37,504
Very good.

422
00:16:37,943 --> 00:16:38,943
Next...

423
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:45,984
Honey, should the bird's nest
be sweetened?

424
00:16:45,984 --> 00:16:46,783
No.

425
00:16:46,783 --> 00:16:48,624
You're going to make me fat
at this hour.

426
00:16:48,943 --> 00:16:50,504
Just add three red dates.

427
00:16:52,023 --> 00:16:53,023
Okay.

428
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,680
(Xia Chunyan's Flight Info)

429
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:09,803
(Xia Chunyan)

430
00:17:13,183 --> 00:17:14,983
Sorry, the number you have dialed

431
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:15,983
is turned off.

432
00:17:18,304 --> 00:17:19,304
Honey.

433
00:17:21,223 --> 00:17:22,223
Honey.

434
00:17:22,423 --> 00:17:23,423
Look.

435
00:17:23,703 --> 00:17:24,625
My sister just sent me

436
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,824
a flight information.

437
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:26,824
She returns from abroad.

438
00:17:29,183 --> 00:17:30,943
It's good that she's coming back.

439
00:17:31,423 --> 00:17:32,224
So much happened.

440
00:17:32,224 --> 00:17:34,024
She should come back
to take care of Xiaojiao.

441
00:17:34,703 --> 00:17:35,943
You and my sister

442
00:17:36,064 --> 00:17:36,983
don't interact much.

443
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:37,983
You don't know her.

444
00:17:38,344 --> 00:17:39,743
Others may help.

445
00:17:39,743 --> 00:17:40,743
She

446
00:17:42,064 --> 00:17:43,064
only causes trouble.

447
00:17:43,943 --> 00:17:44,943
She causes trouble.

448
00:17:45,263 --> 00:17:46,624
It won't affect our family.

449
00:17:47,144 --> 00:17:47,904
Leave it

450
00:17:47,904 --> 00:17:49,104
to her and Xiaojiao.

451
00:17:50,544 --> 00:17:51,344
Just go.

452
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,584
Don't disturb my exercise.

453
00:20:12,463 --> 00:20:13,824
Hello, Dad, Grandpa.

454
00:20:14,304 --> 00:20:14,983
Here you are.

455
00:20:14,983 --> 00:20:15,624
Good.

456
00:20:15,943 --> 00:20:16,943
Hello, Sir.

457
00:20:17,703 --> 00:20:18,703
Kaixin,

458
00:20:18,943 --> 00:20:19,943
long time no see.

459
00:20:20,903 --> 00:20:21,903
How is she?

460
00:20:22,824 --> 00:20:24,743
She had a cardiac arrest earlier.

461
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:26,183
They brought her back.

462
00:20:26,743 --> 00:20:28,423
Her vitals are stable for now.

463
00:20:28,864 --> 00:20:30,024
But what happens next

464
00:20:30,344 --> 00:20:31,703
will have to be left to fate.

465
00:20:34,544 --> 00:20:35,544
How did you sleep?

466
00:20:43,223 --> 00:20:44,463
How about this?

467
00:20:44,463 --> 00:20:46,144
You take good care of her here.

468
00:20:46,144 --> 00:20:47,784
I'll take the kids back to rest first.

469
00:20:47,903 --> 00:20:48,704
If her situation

470
00:20:48,704 --> 00:20:49,983
is stable tomorrow morning,

471
00:20:49,983 --> 00:20:50,625
I'll let them

472
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,983
return to school first.

473
00:20:52,104 --> 00:20:52,944
When she is

474
00:20:52,944 --> 00:20:54,144
moved to a regular ward,

475
00:20:54,384 --> 00:20:55,384
I'll bring them over.

476
00:20:56,223 --> 00:20:57,463
Sir, we'll leave first then.

477
00:20:57,463 --> 00:20:58,463
Xiaomi can't leave.

478
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,384
Xiaomi can go nowhere

479
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,544
before my mom leaves the ICU.

480
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:06,663
Just because you say it?

481
00:21:06,663 --> 00:21:07,663
By what...

482
00:21:15,784 --> 00:21:16,903
Qian Hao. Qian Hao.

483
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:18,344
Alright.

484
00:21:24,223 --> 00:21:25,223
Dad,

485
00:21:27,743 --> 00:21:29,544
I booked a room at the hotel nearby.

486
00:21:30,463 --> 00:21:31,503
You go and rest.

487
00:21:32,463 --> 00:21:33,703
I'll stay here.

488
00:21:45,784 --> 00:21:47,384
If Grandpa catches us,
we'll get changed.

489
00:21:47,384 --> 00:21:48,463
Hurry up.

490
00:21:48,463 --> 00:21:49,983
Change into your pajamas to sleep.

491
00:21:49,983 --> 00:21:50,983
I won't change.

492
00:21:52,064 --> 00:21:53,223
Hurry up. Be good.

493
00:21:54,544 --> 00:21:56,183
Kids who go to bed and wake up early

494
00:21:56,784 --> 00:21:57,824
will be smart.

495
00:21:57,824 --> 00:21:59,104
Come on.

496
00:21:59,104 --> 00:21:59,824
Yu'an, Yule,

497
00:22:00,064 --> 00:22:01,104
stop messing around.

498
00:22:01,104 --> 00:22:01,744
Be good.

499
00:22:01,744 --> 00:22:03,024
Put on your pajamas to sleep.

500
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:04,983
Your dad is back.

501
00:22:05,144 --> 00:22:06,144
Be good.

502
00:22:09,423 --> 00:22:10,423
Good girls.

503
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:12,864
- Goodnight, Grandpa and Dad.
- Goodnight, Grandpa and Dad.

504
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,344
Goodnight, sweeties.

505
00:22:19,024 --> 00:22:20,943
Why were you so fierce to them?

506
00:22:21,943 --> 00:22:22,785
Being naughty

507
00:22:22,785 --> 00:22:24,344
means they are smart.

508
00:22:27,384 --> 00:22:28,064
Dad,

509
00:22:28,144 --> 00:22:29,824
I've already spoiled the kids enough.

510
00:22:30,024 --> 00:22:31,503
You're even more exaggerated.

511
00:22:33,183 --> 00:22:34,903
Little girls need to be spoiled.

512
00:22:39,344 --> 00:22:40,344
By the way,

513
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:42,544
why are you looking for a place?

514
00:22:47,183 --> 00:22:48,183
Well.

515
00:22:48,983 --> 00:22:50,344
Dad, sit down and listen to me.

516
00:22:50,344 --> 00:22:51,624
I didn't get to tell you.

517
00:22:53,183 --> 00:22:54,183
Here's the thing.

518
00:22:54,824 --> 00:22:55,825
Kaixin and her family

519
00:22:55,825 --> 00:22:57,344
are planning to move over here

520
00:22:57,344 --> 00:22:59,104
to be a bit closer to me.

521
00:23:03,064 --> 00:23:05,503
Aren't you living together?

522
00:23:05,503 --> 00:23:06,263
Well,

523
00:23:06,263 --> 00:23:07,703
we adults are fine.

524
00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:09,144
But four kids living together

525
00:23:09,144 --> 00:23:10,903
would be chaotic.

526
00:23:11,544 --> 00:23:12,784
If we live separately,

527
00:23:12,903 --> 00:23:14,104
it'll be more flexible.

528
00:23:14,263 --> 00:23:15,743
It can keep our old family structures

529
00:23:15,743 --> 00:23:17,223
to the greatest extent.

530
00:23:17,223 --> 00:23:18,224
Such a transition period

531
00:23:18,224 --> 00:23:19,304
will make all comfortable.

532
00:23:21,503 --> 00:23:22,824
It's a good idea,

533
00:23:23,784 --> 00:23:24,784
but it's costly.

534
00:23:26,183 --> 00:23:28,183
You have to pay the rent, right?

535
00:23:29,503 --> 00:23:30,503
Well,

536
00:23:30,824 --> 00:23:32,624
your mother-in-law and I
put in the effort

537
00:23:32,624 --> 00:23:34,223
to save money raising your kids for you,

538
00:23:34,463 --> 00:23:36,503
yet you use it to subsidize others.

539
00:23:37,183 --> 00:23:38,344
It's not what you think.

540
00:23:38,344 --> 00:23:39,344
She's paying herself.

541
00:23:40,703 --> 00:23:41,784
Who would believe that?

542
00:23:41,784 --> 00:23:42,943
If you don't believe it,

543
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:44,544
we can go together when she pays.

544
00:23:44,943 --> 00:23:46,743
Don't put on an act in front of me.

545
00:23:46,743 --> 00:23:49,024
You'll give the money back to her later.

546
00:23:49,263 --> 00:23:50,624
So stop fooling me

547
00:23:50,624 --> 00:23:51,784
and your mother-in-law,

548
00:23:52,983 --> 00:23:54,384
Xu Kaixin

549
00:23:54,384 --> 00:23:56,104
seems fine on the surface,

550
00:23:56,223 --> 00:23:58,503
but she's quite shrewd.

551
00:24:00,423 --> 00:24:02,503
Let me say this upfront.

552
00:24:03,344 --> 00:24:04,584
If you are having

553
00:24:04,584 --> 00:24:05,663
a serious relationship,

554
00:24:05,663 --> 00:24:06,784
I'm okay with it.

555
00:24:07,064 --> 00:24:08,025
But if you're using

556
00:24:08,025 --> 00:24:09,624
the money for Yu'an and Yule

557
00:24:09,624 --> 00:24:11,183
to raise someone else's kids,

558
00:24:12,663 --> 00:24:13,663
that's unacceptable.

559
00:24:14,104 --> 00:24:15,104
Dad, it's...

560
00:24:29,824 --> 00:24:32,104
What is he thinking?

561
00:24:47,024 --> 00:24:48,064
These two kids

562
00:24:48,064 --> 00:24:49,344
fought so badly during the day,

563
00:24:49,344 --> 00:24:50,584
but forgot about it quickly.

564
00:24:52,624 --> 00:24:53,305
Well,

565
00:24:53,305 --> 00:24:54,544
when they were taking a shower,

566
00:24:55,024 --> 00:24:57,024
Dami kept coaxing Xiaomi.

567
00:24:58,183 --> 00:24:59,624
Actually, she regretted it

568
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:00,903
right after she pushed him.

569
00:25:02,064 --> 00:25:03,423
She feels her dad

570
00:25:03,423 --> 00:25:04,424
wants her brother

571
00:25:04,424 --> 00:25:05,584
and doesn't care about her.

572
00:25:07,263 --> 00:25:08,943
Being on Qian Hao's mind is never good.

573
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,904
Which kid

574
00:25:10,904 --> 00:25:12,304
doesn't want the dad's love?

575
00:25:13,024 --> 00:25:14,943
She feels like she's superfluous.

576
00:25:15,983 --> 00:25:17,544
My daughter is never superfluous.

577
00:25:20,263 --> 00:25:21,263
Exactly.

578
00:25:23,943 --> 00:25:25,423
Seeing Qian Hao like that just now,

579
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:26,624
I even feel sorry for him.

580
00:25:27,104 --> 00:25:27,904
Besides, he's not

581
00:25:27,904 --> 00:25:29,344
the father of Hu Xiaojiao's child.

582
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,463
It's true that what goes around

583
00:25:32,463 --> 00:25:33,943
comes around.

584
00:25:36,064 --> 00:25:37,064
He said

585
00:25:37,503 --> 00:25:40,544
Xiaomi must stay
to accompany his grandma.

586
00:25:41,463 --> 00:25:42,903
He said a lot.

587
00:25:43,144 --> 00:25:44,384
I won't listen to him.

588
00:25:44,384 --> 00:25:45,384
Exactly.

589
00:25:47,304 --> 00:25:48,503
When you divorced,

590
00:25:48,503 --> 00:25:50,503
he played dirty
to swindle half of the property

591
00:25:50,584 --> 00:25:51,584
and other assets.

592
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:52,584
Do you still want them?

593
00:25:54,624 --> 00:25:55,624
Honestly,

594
00:25:56,024 --> 00:25:57,584
I really don't want the money

595
00:25:57,584 --> 00:25:59,144
to just go to him for nothing.

596
00:26:00,384 --> 00:26:02,183
But now Qian Hao

597
00:26:02,344 --> 00:26:03,184
is like living

598
00:26:03,184 --> 00:26:04,703
in a pit of mud.

599
00:26:04,903 --> 00:26:05,625
He wants to drag

600
00:26:05,625 --> 00:26:06,824
whoever he sees in.

601
00:26:10,503 --> 00:26:11,224
If I am

602
00:26:11,224 --> 00:26:12,503
involved into this,

603
00:26:13,144 --> 00:26:14,144
I think

604
00:26:14,784 --> 00:26:16,064
this issue won't be resolved

605
00:26:16,064 --> 00:26:17,263
in a year or two.

606
00:26:17,903 --> 00:26:18,903
I'd rather

607
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:21,263
choose the peaceful

608
00:26:21,384 --> 00:26:23,144
and beautiful life now.

609
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:26,864
Makes sense.

610
00:26:27,384 --> 00:26:28,304
After the divorce,

611
00:26:28,384 --> 00:26:29,544
you have been striving

612
00:26:29,544 --> 00:26:30,544
for a better life.

613
00:26:30,663 --> 00:26:32,223
You've finally got back on track.

614
00:26:32,503 --> 00:26:34,263
Let's stay far away from Qian Hao.

615
00:26:34,584 --> 00:26:35,385
So he won't

616
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:36,663
stir things up again.

617
00:26:38,784 --> 00:26:39,824
Besides,

618
00:26:40,344 --> 00:26:41,743
he can't neglect Dami and Xiaomi,

619
00:26:41,743 --> 00:26:43,064
his own kids,

620
00:26:43,304 --> 00:26:44,184
but leave everything

621
00:26:44,184 --> 00:26:45,743
to the fake one Xiaojiao is carrying.

622
00:26:46,903 --> 00:26:47,785
Perhaps,

623
00:26:47,785 --> 00:26:49,223
even if you don't fight for it,

624
00:26:49,304 --> 00:26:50,344
heaven will eventually

625
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:51,800
return these to Dami and Xiaomi.

626
00:26:51,832 --> 00:26:53,743
Things that belong
to them cannot be taken away.

627
00:26:55,263 --> 00:26:57,144
As long as he doesn't harm my kids,

628
00:26:57,263 --> 00:26:58,423
he can do whatever he wants.

629
00:26:59,503 --> 00:27:00,864
Let's stop talking about him,

630
00:27:00,983 --> 00:27:02,223
and let's talk about you.

631
00:27:03,384 --> 00:27:04,384
Song Ran.

632
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:13,263
Keep your voice down.

633
00:27:15,183 --> 00:27:15,865
Don't you think

634
00:27:15,865 --> 00:27:17,263
Song Ran treats me like a fool?

635
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,223
He thought the bank cards

636
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:19,585
and deeds

637
00:27:19,585 --> 00:27:20,663
would do the trick?

638
00:27:20,983 --> 00:27:22,544
Wouldn't it make me a temporary keeper?

639
00:27:22,703 --> 00:27:24,104
Give them to me if he dares.

640
00:27:24,663 --> 00:27:25,463
I was moved?

641
00:27:25,463 --> 00:27:26,463
Ridiculous.

642
00:27:27,064 --> 00:27:29,024
What a greasy man!
Stop playing innocent with me.

643
00:27:29,384 --> 00:27:30,384
Wait,

644
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:31,944
it's not impossible

645
00:27:31,944 --> 00:27:33,663
that he truly wants

646
00:27:34,743 --> 00:27:36,024
to give you all those things.

647
00:27:36,743 --> 00:27:37,983
When Song Ran was in college,

648
00:27:37,983 --> 00:27:38,983
he was crazier than this.

649
00:27:39,104 --> 00:27:40,223
I've seen it myself.

650
00:27:41,463 --> 00:27:42,943
Let's not bring it up.

651
00:27:43,624 --> 00:27:44,743
Song Ran's body

652
00:27:45,144 --> 00:27:46,423
might still be vigorous,

653
00:27:46,784 --> 00:27:48,024
his spirit has become greasy.

654
00:27:49,344 --> 00:27:50,264
Being soaked

655
00:27:50,264 --> 00:27:51,824
by daily trifles for over a decade,

656
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:53,544
who wouldn't be greasy?

657
00:27:54,703 --> 00:27:55,464
Let's not

658
00:27:55,464 --> 00:27:57,144
cast stones when we're much the same.

659
00:27:58,864 --> 00:27:59,864
Honestly,

660
00:28:00,223 --> 00:28:02,544
if he gives you his property, car,

661
00:28:02,824 --> 00:28:03,903
and everything else,

662
00:28:04,144 --> 00:28:05,304
what do you plan to do?

663
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:08,064
Then I'll hold him in high regard.

664
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,064
He won't need to propose.

665
00:28:09,223 --> 00:28:10,663
I'll buy the ring,

666
00:28:10,663 --> 00:28:12,304
kneel down, and propose to him.

667
00:28:16,463 --> 00:28:17,463
Li Xiaoxiao,

668
00:28:17,943 --> 00:28:18,704
is that

669
00:28:18,704 --> 00:28:20,104
your real plan?

670
00:28:20,104 --> 00:28:21,344
Xu Kaixin,

671
00:28:21,344 --> 00:28:22,544
don't make it

672
00:28:23,183 --> 00:28:24,183
so straightforward.

673
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:31,784
Let's go and have a drink.

674
00:28:32,263 --> 00:28:33,943
It's too late.

675
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:35,463
Let's go.

676
00:28:41,104 --> 00:28:43,384
Once upon a time, there was a couple.

677
00:28:43,584 --> 00:28:45,104
They lived next

678
00:28:45,104 --> 00:28:46,344
to a pretty vegetable garden.

679
00:28:46,864 --> 00:28:47,864
One day,

680
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:49,584
the wife wanted to try

681
00:28:49,584 --> 00:28:51,384
the mushrooms grown in the garden.

682
00:28:51,903 --> 00:28:54,024
But the owner of the garden

683
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:55,903
was an evil witch.

684
00:28:56,824 --> 00:28:57,824
The husband thought

685
00:28:57,943 --> 00:28:59,104
the witch might not notice

686
00:28:59,503 --> 00:29:02,144
if he took just a little.

687
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:04,903
He was wrong.

688
00:29:05,263 --> 00:29:07,824
The wicked witch caught him on the spot.

689
00:29:08,183 --> 00:29:09,503
"How dare you"

690
00:29:09,743 --> 00:29:11,384
"steal my mushrooms!"

691
00:29:11,384 --> 00:29:12,864
The wicked witch shouted.

692
00:29:12,864 --> 00:29:13,983
The man explained

693
00:29:14,183 --> 00:29:16,983
that his wife really wanted
to taste the mushrooms.

694
00:29:17,064 --> 00:29:18,223
"As long as you agree"

695
00:29:18,223 --> 00:29:19,544
"to give me"

696
00:29:19,544 --> 00:29:20,544
"your first child,"

697
00:29:21,223 --> 00:29:22,344
said the wicked witch,

698
00:29:22,463 --> 00:29:24,983
"you can take as many as you want."

You're up.

726
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:58,983
Come and eat.

727
00:32:00,423 --> 00:32:02,263
When I used to stay at home,

728
00:32:02,263 --> 00:32:03,824
I didn't have this kind of treatment.

729
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:06,624

fatherly love is also conditional.

731
00:32:09,864 --> 00:32:10,864
Hurry up and eat.

00:32:11,183 --> 00:32:11,984
Your dad and I

733
00:32:11,984 --> 00:32:13,304
will drive you to the company.

734
00:32:14,024 --> 00:32:15,024
No.

735
00:32:20,463 --> 00:32:21,105
I...

736
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:23,463
I-I mean,

737
00:32:24,463 --> 00:32:26,263
I'm not an elementary student anymore.

738
00:32:26,584 --> 00:32:28,223
How can I still let you drive me?

739
00:32:28,663 --> 00:32:29,784
Besides, you never drove me

740
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:31,223
when I was in elementary school.

741
00:32:33,463 --> 00:32:35,064
You don't drive.

742
00:32:35,463 --> 00:32:37,024
Your mom and I will drive you there

743
00:32:37,024 --> 00:32:38,263
and check out the route,

744
00:32:38,384 --> 00:32:39,584
so we won't have trouble

745
00:32:39,584 --> 00:32:40,263
finding you.

746
00:32:40,263 --> 00:32:41,263
That's right.

747
00:32:41,344 --> 00:32:42,144
No.

748
00:32:42,304 --> 00:32:43,903
It's embarrassing if colleagues see me.

749
00:32:44,183 --> 00:32:45,624
Go if you want to. I won't.

750
00:32:46,223 --> 00:32:47,263
I'm going back to sleep.

751
00:32:47,624 --> 00:32:48,824
We won't go then.

752
00:32:50,423 --> 00:32:51,183
You won't go?

753
00:32:51,423 --> 00:32:52,423
No, we won't.

754
00:32:53,423 --> 00:32:54,263
Really?

755
00:32:54,423 --> 00:32:55,503
We won't go.

756
00:32:55,624 --> 00:32:57,263
Sit down and eat.

757
00:33:16,624 --> 00:33:17,624
Honey,

758
00:33:18,544 --> 00:33:20,223
now you believe what I said, right?

759
00:33:20,903 --> 00:33:22,903
There's something fishy
about Youyou's job.

760
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,784
As you know,

761
00:33:25,864 --> 00:33:27,624
Youyou doesn't want us to go with her.

762
00:33:28,183 --> 00:33:30,183
We don't have to listen to her.

763
00:33:31,903 --> 00:33:33,064
At this point,

764
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:36,384
it's time for me,
the Famous Detective, to act.

765
00:33:43,304 --> 00:33:45,024
Have you bled again since last night?

766
00:33:45,463 --> 00:33:46,183
No.

767
00:33:46,183 --> 00:33:47,183
That's good.

768
00:33:47,784 --> 00:33:49,183
Breakfast will be delivered soon.

769
00:33:49,183 --> 00:33:50,263
Shots are at around 10 AM.

770
00:33:51,223 --> 00:33:53,024
Are they as painful
as yesterday's shots?

771
00:33:53,024 --> 00:33:54,024
There's one more shot.

772
00:34:08,703 --> 00:34:10,703
Did anyone come to see me last night?

773
00:34:10,703 --> 00:34:12,263
A man in his thirties?

774
00:34:12,703 --> 00:34:13,703
No.

775
00:34:14,703 --> 00:34:15,904
But your uncle called

776
00:34:15,904 --> 00:34:17,064
to check on you a few times.

777
00:34:17,504 --> 00:34:18,624
Would you like some water?

778
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:19,823
No.

779
00:34:23,944 --> 00:34:24,864
Help me up.

780
00:34:24,864 --> 00:34:26,104
Let's go out for a walk.

781
00:34:26,104 --> 00:34:27,343
You are on bed rest

782
00:34:27,343 --> 00:34:29,944
for the pregnancy now.
You can't just walk around.

783
00:34:29,944 --> 00:34:31,464
It's on me if anything happens.

784
00:34:31,663 --> 00:34:32,904
You can't do it this way.

785
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:33,823
I paid you.

786
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:35,263
Do whatever I tell you to do.

787
00:34:35,263 --> 00:34:36,263
Alright?

788
00:34:37,183 --> 00:34:38,025
Alright then.

789
00:34:38,025 --> 00:34:39,504
I'll bring the wheelchair over.

790
00:34:52,743 --> 00:34:53,743
Stop.

791
00:35:07,703 --> 00:35:08,703
Wake up.

792
00:35:10,223 --> 00:35:11,223
Wake up.

793
00:35:11,624 --> 00:35:12,703
Mom. Mom.

794
00:35:14,263 --> 00:35:15,783
Are you a family member of Qin Sulan?

795
00:35:16,024 --> 00:35:17,823
Right.

796
00:35:19,303 --> 00:35:20,105
How is my mom?

797
00:35:20,105 --> 00:35:21,383
Don't worry.

798
00:35:21,823 --> 00:35:23,504
Her vitals last night

799
00:35:23,504 --> 00:35:24,783
were quite stable.

800
00:35:24,783 --> 00:35:26,263
We didn't find new bleeding points.

801
00:35:26,263 --> 00:35:27,303
But she's still in a coma.

802
00:35:27,303 --> 00:35:28,624
She hasn't woken up yet.

803
00:35:28,624 --> 00:35:29,743
So she can't be considered

804
00:35:29,743 --> 00:35:31,223
out of the woods yet.

805
00:35:32,144 --> 00:35:33,984
But making it through

806
00:35:33,984 --> 00:35:35,223
a perilous night

807
00:35:35,223 --> 00:35:36,904
is good news.

808
00:35:39,823 --> 00:35:40,424
Thank you.

809
00:35:40,424 --> 00:35:41,184
It's okay.

810
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,223
Thank you. Thank you.

811
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,263
Thank you.

812
00:35:44,383 --> 00:35:45,904
You should go back and get some rest.

813
00:35:46,223 --> 00:35:47,584
If there's anything, we will

814
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,863
inform you immediately, okay?

815
00:35:49,104 --> 00:35:50,104
Let's go.

816
00:35:50,504 --> 00:35:51,663
Let's go back quickly.

817
00:35:51,863 --> 00:35:53,984
Thank you, thank you.

818
00:35:54,223 --> 00:35:55,025
Rest well.

819
00:35:55,025 --> 00:35:56,263
Thank you.

820
00:36:17,424 --> 00:36:18,424
Hurry.

821
00:36:20,064 --> 00:36:21,383
A little faster.

822
00:36:26,424 --> 00:36:27,783
Alright.

823
00:36:27,904 --> 00:36:28,904
Let's go.

824
00:36:37,104 --> 00:36:38,783
Lower the bed a bit for me.

825
00:36:39,024 --> 00:36:39,703
Later,

826
00:36:39,703 --> 00:36:40,545
someone will come.

827
00:36:40,545 --> 00:36:42,064
Just say I've been sleeping.

828
00:36:42,504 --> 00:36:43,424
And then you can

829
00:36:43,424 --> 00:36:44,424
pretend to wake me up.

830
00:36:44,424 --> 00:36:44,905
Okay.

831
00:36:44,905 --> 00:36:46,024
Lower a bit.

832
00:37:12,984 --> 00:37:14,024
Who are you looking for?

833
00:37:16,424 --> 00:37:17,424
Xiaojiao.

834
00:37:17,743 --> 00:37:18,743
My darling.

835
00:37:19,544 --> 00:37:20,544
Mom?

836
00:38:20,104 --> 00:38:21,104
Sir.

837
00:38:22,223 --> 00:38:23,703
They checked out early this morning.

838
00:38:24,104 --> 00:38:25,104
They checked out?

839
00:38:26,183 --> 00:38:27,783
They were taking the kids to school.

840
00:38:43,464 --> 00:38:44,064
Bye.

841
00:38:44,064 --> 00:38:44,944
Bye. Bye.

842
00:38:44,944 --> 00:38:45,944
Bye.

843
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:47,264
Drink more water.

844
00:38:47,264 --> 00:38:48,303
Xiaomi, good morning.

845
00:38:48,303 --> 00:38:49,823
Hello.

846
00:38:49,823 --> 00:38:50,624
Good morning.

847
00:38:50,783 --> 00:38:52,104
Okay, come in.

848
00:38:52,584 --> 00:38:53,584
Okay.

849
00:38:58,823 --> 00:38:59,984
How is it going?

850
00:39:02,743 --> 00:39:04,024
My mom is temporarily fine.

851
00:39:05,544 --> 00:39:06,944
Why did you check out?

852
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:07,984
Didn't we agree

853
00:39:07,984 --> 00:39:08,984
Xiaomi would stay here

854
00:39:08,984 --> 00:39:09,905
with me?

855
00:39:09,905 --> 00:39:11,584
When did I agree to that?

856
00:39:12,544 --> 00:39:13,224
Xu Kaixin,

857
00:39:13,224 --> 00:39:15,064
how can you be so cold-hearted?

858
00:39:15,663 --> 00:39:17,944
Xiaomi is my mom's last hope.

859
00:39:17,944 --> 00:39:18,864
If I were cold-hearted,

860
00:39:18,864 --> 00:39:20,104
I wouldn't have taken the kids

861
00:39:20,104 --> 00:39:21,144
to show up yesterday.

862
00:39:21,144 --> 00:39:22,383
I won't waste words with you.

863
00:39:22,383 --> 00:39:23,584
If your mom gets discharged

864
00:39:23,584 --> 00:39:24,663
or can be visited now,

865
00:39:24,663 --> 00:39:25,624
I'll immediately take

866
00:39:25,624 --> 00:39:26,383
the kids over.

867
00:39:26,504 --> 00:39:27,425
If you want my son

868
00:39:27,425 --> 00:39:28,624
to be there day and night,

869
00:39:28,624 --> 00:39:29,464
you can dream on.

870
00:39:29,624 --> 00:39:30,984
That's it. I need to go.

871
00:39:32,703 --> 00:39:33,703
Heroine.

872
00:39:45,223 --> 00:39:46,584
I'm off to work. What about you?

873
00:39:47,183 --> 00:39:48,343
Mei Chengyi found a place.

874
00:39:48,343 --> 00:39:49,264
The agent has the key.

875
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:50,424
I'm going to take a look now.

876
00:39:50,504 --> 00:39:51,264
Also,

877
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:52,424
I saw a shop for rental

878
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:53,464
near Dami's school.

879
00:39:53,464 --> 00:39:54,144
Now I'm free,

880
00:39:54,144 --> 00:39:55,064
I'll go to check out

881
00:39:55,064 --> 00:39:56,064
the foot traffic.

882
00:39:56,703 --> 00:39:57,545
The rent is cheap.

883
00:39:57,545 --> 00:39:58,783
It's even better than before.

884
00:39:59,584 --> 00:40:00,743
Didn't you say online sales

885
00:40:00,743 --> 00:40:01,783
are more cost-effective

886
00:40:01,783 --> 00:40:03,104
than a physical store?

887
00:40:03,383 --> 00:40:04,424
Don't you remember?

888
00:40:04,424 --> 00:40:05,425
We can't just rely on

889
00:40:05,425 --> 00:40:06,783
the previous customers online.

890
00:40:07,064 --> 00:40:08,343
We'll lose them sooner or later.

891
00:40:08,343 --> 00:40:09,383
You just won't admit it.

892
00:40:09,383 --> 00:40:10,703
Tell me if you need more money.

893
00:40:10,703 --> 00:40:11,703
I can transfer it to you.

894
00:40:15,544 --> 00:40:16,544
Good morning, Mei.

895
00:40:17,303 --> 00:40:18,303
Good morning, Mei.

896
00:40:28,944 --> 00:40:29,944
Thank you.

897
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:33,663
M-Mei?

898
00:40:34,303 --> 00:40:34,744
Mei.

899
00:40:34,744 --> 00:40:35,823
Mei, you're finally here.

900
00:40:36,104 --> 00:40:36,904
If you didn't come,

901
00:40:36,904 --> 00:40:37,863
Li's smile lines could

902
00:40:37,863 --> 00:40:38,663
touch his hairline.

903
00:40:38,663 --> 00:40:39,505
Mei, are you okay?

904
00:40:39,505 --> 00:40:40,584
What happened yesterday?

905
00:40:40,584 --> 00:40:41,944
We were all very worried.

906
00:40:41,944 --> 00:40:43,703
Mei Chengyi, come to my office.

907
00:40:48,584 --> 00:40:49,584
We'll talk later.

908
00:40:52,144 --> 00:40:53,144
Oh no.

909
00:40:53,424 --> 00:40:54,663
This is bad.

910
00:40:55,263 --> 00:40:56,303
Mei Chengyi,

911
00:40:56,303 --> 00:40:57,024
did you forget

912
00:40:57,024 --> 00:40:58,024
what I said to you?

913
00:40:58,104 --> 00:40:59,663
The company was very dissatisfied

914
00:40:59,663 --> 00:41:01,424
because of your various leaves already.

915
00:41:02,144 --> 00:41:03,383
You do have some achievements,

916
00:41:03,383 --> 00:41:04,984
but you can't be self-complacent.

917
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:06,783
Based on your performance yesterday,

918
00:41:07,183 --> 00:41:08,743
you'll be first on the layoff list.

919
00:41:08,743 --> 00:41:09,223
Okay.

920
00:41:09,223 --> 00:41:10,223
Right?

921
00:41:12,343 --> 00:41:13,424
W-What did you say?

922
00:41:13,424 --> 00:41:14,584
I said you can lay me off.

923
00:41:15,223 --> 00:41:15,985
Of course,

924
00:41:15,985 --> 00:41:17,263
with the 2N+1 compensation,

925
00:41:17,343 --> 00:41:18,504
not a penny less.

926
00:41:21,743 --> 00:41:24,223
You're being arrogant.

927
00:41:24,863 --> 00:41:25,863
Mei Chengyi,

928
00:41:26,743 --> 00:41:28,984
for these years,
your work has been affected

929
00:41:28,984 --> 00:41:30,183
by your family matters.

930
00:41:30,263 --> 00:41:32,104
I have taken a lot of blame for you.

931
00:41:32,104 --> 00:41:32,905
You can't

932
00:41:32,905 --> 00:41:34,303
get too cocky because you signed

933
00:41:34,303 --> 00:41:35,904
a few big sales deals.

934
00:41:35,904 --> 00:41:37,584
Don't forget the trouble you've caused.

935
00:41:38,984 --> 00:41:39,984
Ms. Li,

936
00:41:40,663 --> 00:41:42,223
you brought me into the industry,

937
00:41:42,223 --> 00:41:43,823
and I've always been grateful to you.

938
00:41:44,464 --> 00:41:45,743
Your so-called gratitude

939
00:41:45,743 --> 00:41:47,223
is just arrogance in disguise.

940
00:41:47,343 --> 00:41:48,823
I can't bear it.

941
00:41:49,144 --> 00:41:51,104
Ms. Li, you are a smart person.

942
00:41:51,544 --> 00:41:52,544
I am not foolish either.

943
00:41:52,904 --> 00:41:53,904
I know

944
00:41:53,984 --> 00:41:54,984
when a company lays off,

945
00:41:55,303 --> 00:41:56,303
the first slash

946
00:41:56,584 --> 00:41:57,344
has always aimed

947
00:41:57,344 --> 00:41:58,984
at mid-to-senior managers aged over 35.

948
00:41:58,984 --> 00:41:59,823
If you lay me off,

949
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:01,223
I won't be surprised at all.

950
00:42:03,383 --> 00:42:04,863
You shouldn't listen

951
00:42:04,863 --> 00:42:05,863
to such rumors.

952
00:42:06,064 --> 00:42:06,904
Alright?

953
00:42:06,904 --> 00:42:09,183
There were some errors in your group.

954
00:42:09,263 --> 00:42:10,065
Isn't that normal

955
00:42:10,065 --> 00:42:11,424
if the company is dissatisfied?

956
00:42:11,743 --> 00:42:13,263
It's a layoff of the entire group.

957
00:42:14,464 --> 00:42:15,863
You used a small mistake

958
00:42:15,863 --> 00:42:17,104
to cut our project bonuses

959
00:42:17,104 --> 00:42:17,945
and my commission.

960
00:42:17,945 --> 00:42:19,424
Wouldn't it be too outrageous?

961
00:42:20,183 --> 00:42:21,183
Who?

962
00:42:22,263 --> 00:42:23,424
Who told you that?

963
00:42:25,944 --> 00:42:27,624
It is not important.

964
00:42:29,544 --> 00:42:30,544
Chengyi,

965
00:42:31,343 --> 00:42:32,504
how did I teach you

966
00:42:32,663 --> 00:42:34,263
when you joined the industry?

967
00:42:34,383 --> 00:42:36,624
Do not judge things until the end.

968
00:42:36,624 --> 00:42:37,424
Right.

969
00:42:37,544 --> 00:42:39,383
The company is dissatisfied with you.

970
00:42:39,544 --> 00:42:41,504
But if you handle things nicely,

971
00:42:41,584 --> 00:42:43,024
you'll have a turning point.

972
00:42:43,584 --> 00:42:44,823
You are my subordinate.

973
00:42:45,424 --> 00:42:46,783
Would I harm you?

974
00:42:48,424 --> 00:42:49,663
To you,

975
00:42:50,144 --> 00:42:51,863
abandonment is sacrificing pawns.

976
00:42:52,504 --> 00:42:53,504
I totally get it.

977
00:42:54,223 --> 00:42:55,024
Ms. Li,

978
00:42:55,104 --> 00:42:57,064
no, I should call you Master.

979
00:42:58,584 --> 00:42:59,783
If we go your way,

980
00:43:00,504 --> 00:43:02,024
I am not satisfied with this ending.

981
00:43:02,263 --> 00:43:03,504
So, this time,

982
00:43:03,584 --> 00:43:04,783
let's proceed in my way.
