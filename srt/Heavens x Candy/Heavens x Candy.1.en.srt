1
00:00:26,038 --> 00:00:29,790
Towa Amemiya is my lover.

2
00:00:30,159 --> 00:00:31,241
Well...

3
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:34,827
I was wearing
color contact lenses and a wig.

4
00:00:37,323 --> 00:00:40,733
I want to make love to you.

5
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,900
We were in entirely different worlds
six months ago.

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:58,370
Whenever I make love to him,

7
00:00:59,046 --> 00:01:03,256
I always feel like I'm ascending to heaven.

8
00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:09,475
But...

9
00:01:10,378 --> 00:01:14,460
I feel I can change that when I'm with you.

10
00:01:18,675 --> 00:01:19,897
Me too...

11
00:01:20,795 --> 00:01:21,920
Towa.

12
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:33,249
I feel like our bodies melt into one.

13
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:50,381
Just like sweet and delicious candy.

14
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,491
(Heavens Candy)

15
00:02:59,744 --> 00:03:01,755
(EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW WITH
A POPULAR SEXY ACTOR!)

16
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,274
I was a regular host in Kabukicho
before I took this job.

17
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:09,237
That's when one of my clients asked me
if I wanted to work in adult movies.

18
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:14,410
I didn't find out until later,

19
00:03:14,435 --> 00:03:17,569
but the client was a pretty famous
adult movie actress.

20
00:03:19,278 --> 00:03:21,112
(WERE YOU RELUCTANT AT ALL
TO WORK IN PORN?)

21
00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:23,295
Not in the slightest!

22
00:03:23,747 --> 00:03:25,545
I love girls.

23
00:03:26,108 --> 00:03:28,366
I'm confident in bed, too.

24
00:03:30,902 --> 00:03:32,760
(WHAT KIND OF GIRLS DO YOU LIKE?)

25
00:03:32,785 --> 00:03:37,647
Actually, I've never had a
proper relationship with a woman.

26
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:42,585
I'm the kinda guy who loves everyone,

27
00:03:43,382 --> 00:03:47,288
so I could never love only one person.

28
00:03:48,971 --> 00:03:52,467
That's why I think this job is
my true calling.

29
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:01,470
(HOW DO YOU SPEND YOUR DAYS OFF?)

30
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:03,300
My days off?

31
00:04:04,295 --> 00:04:08,827
I'm a total hermit, so
I usually watch anime all day at home.

32
00:04:10,024 --> 00:04:15,178
I actually proposed the idea for
this movie directly to the producers.

33
00:04:16,274 --> 00:04:20,741
It's one of my favorite works, so I wanted
to make a love-filled parody of it.

34
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:26,764
I asked Mayu Nayuta to play
the role of the heroine, Hazuki.

35
00:04:30,082 --> 00:04:32,608
Takato! I fixed up some lunch!

36
00:04:37,267 --> 00:04:42,937
She sounds just like the voice
actress Yuria Nijikawa.

37
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:53,740
(SIX MONTHS EARLIER)

38
00:05:03,276 --> 00:05:05,307
I made your favorite fried noodles!

39
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:16,841
Thanks for the meal!

40
00:05:19,418 --> 00:05:23,650
Speaking of food, I heard there's a
Heaven's Candy event in Shinjuku next week.

41
00:05:24,805 --> 00:05:27,150
I saw an advertising truck in Kabukicho.

42
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,815
What does he mean by "Heaven's Candy"?

43
00:05:37,615 --> 00:05:40,033
It's an anime that's
really popular right now.

44
00:05:41,106 --> 00:05:45,057
My old colleague dropped by
after work the other day.

45
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:48,197
He says it's a huge hit among hosts.

46
00:05:50,138 --> 00:05:52,932
Hosts watch anime these days, huh?

47
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:58,119
Their clients are all watching it,
so it's a big point of conversation.

48
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,510
Their sudden interest is
annoying for us longtime fans.

49
00:06:05,426 --> 00:06:06,474
Huh?

50
00:06:07,877 --> 00:06:11,135
Tickets to Yuria Nijikawa's
handshake event sell out instantly.

51
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,174
Even buying a shitload of CDs doesn't
guarantee a lottery win. It's the pits.

52
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:20,682
Who is this Yuria Nijikawa?

53
00:06:23,138 --> 00:06:25,400
The voice actress
who plays the heroine, Hazuki.

54
00:06:27,876 --> 00:06:32,088
People are saying Yuria Nijikawa is a
breakthrough actress, but they're wrong.

55
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:34,369
She's been popular for years.

56
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,361
Takato spoke?

57
00:07:01,042 --> 00:07:01,946
Yeah.

58
00:07:03,926 --> 00:07:07,221
I haven't heard his voice in ages.

59
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:09,713
Likewise.

60
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:16,994
It's all thanks to you!

61
00:07:17,864 --> 00:07:20,002
Let's thank Heaven's Candy.

62
00:07:21,934 --> 00:07:23,252
Yusuke, wait.

63
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:25,604
You have mayonnaise on your face.

64
00:07:26,925 --> 00:07:30,065
How on earth do you get it stuck here?

65
00:07:37,562 --> 00:07:38,455
What?

66
00:07:40,844 --> 00:07:42,760
The way you lick it is so sexy.

67
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,660
Hey...

68
00:07:57,165 --> 00:07:59,408
What's up?

69
00:08:02,245 --> 00:08:03,893
I want some spending money.

70
00:08:04,815 --> 00:08:08,285
Oh, I see! How much do you want?

71
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:09,690
Hold on a second!

72
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,630
What do you need it for?

73
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,885
I'm going to a fan event.

74
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:18,423
The Heaven's Candy one?

75
00:08:21,371 --> 00:08:24,751
Takato, if you want to go to
events like that, you need to work!

76
00:08:24,776 --> 00:08:26,572
Hey, it's fine!

77
00:08:27,362 --> 00:08:30,877
It's not every day that
Takato wants to go somewhere.

78
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:37,361
Here. Is this enough?

79
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,259
Go have some fun!

80
00:08:48,776 --> 00:08:50,096
Yusuke!

81
00:08:50,846 --> 00:08:52,432
You're too soft on him!

82
00:08:54,059 --> 00:08:56,916
We're partly to blame that
he ended up like that.

83
00:08:58,843 --> 00:09:00,815
Let's not be hasty and keep an eye on him.

84
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,166
If you say so.

85
00:09:11,094 --> 00:09:15,213
Shinya, you're such a good mother to him.

86
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,416
Thank you.

87
00:09:21,749 --> 00:09:22,791
Yusuke.

88
00:09:23,732 --> 00:09:24,842
Yeah?

89
00:09:26,515 --> 00:09:30,393
Want me to do that thing you like?

90
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,340
Hey!

91
00:09:55,588 --> 00:09:57,627
Yusuke, cut it out!

92
00:09:57,744 --> 00:09:59,070
Why?

93
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:00,799
I'm trying to wash the dishes!

94
00:10:01,578 --> 00:10:05,318
How can you say that dressed up like this?

95
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,970
Yusuke!

96
00:10:17,701 --> 00:10:19,166
It's hard.

97
00:10:25,602 --> 00:10:27,042
Yusuke...

98
00:10:34,158 --> 00:10:35,540
Feel good?

99
00:10:35,565 --> 00:10:36,835
Yes!

100
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,610
This is hard as a rock, too!

101
00:11:19,739 --> 00:11:21,139
Shinya...

102
00:11:22,035 --> 00:11:25,127
Something kinky just came out.

103
00:11:26,806 --> 00:11:29,666
That's totally your fault.

104
00:11:32,452 --> 00:11:34,807
- Yusuke!
- What?

105
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:39,520
How can you get so hard at your age?

106
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:43,020
I blame you.

107
00:11:44,015 --> 00:11:45,235
Good.

108
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,340
That's what I wanted to hear.

109
00:11:55,768 --> 00:11:58,108
Yusuke, stop!

110
00:11:58,921 --> 00:12:03,131
You'll drive me crazy if you go any harder!

111
00:12:09,746 --> 00:12:10,776
Take it!

112
00:12:14,812 --> 00:12:16,142
Yusuke.

113
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,340
Tell me when you're gonna cum.

114
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:21,430
I wanna cum with you!

115
00:12:26,716 --> 00:12:29,216
You're gonna burst, huh!

116
00:12:30,528 --> 00:12:32,279
You like it like this?

117
00:12:50,243 --> 00:12:52,693
Wait, is that the latest episode?

118
00:12:54,349 --> 00:12:55,113
Huh?

119
00:12:55,138 --> 00:12:57,052
I haven't seen it yet.

120
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,840
Oh? You watch Heaven's Candy, too?

121
00:13:00,865 --> 00:13:04,175
Yeah. I don't look it, but
I'm a huge geek.

122
00:13:05,193 --> 00:13:07,413
- Let's take off that robe.
- Sure.

123
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,300
Are you going to the fan event on Saturday?

124
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:16,475
Huh?

125
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,434
Yeah, it's been on
my schedule for a while now.

126
00:13:19,459 --> 00:13:20,569
Really!?

127
00:13:20,781 --> 00:13:22,441
Let's go together!

128
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,890
Really? I'm down with that, but...

129
00:13:26,371 --> 00:13:27,911
do you hear yourself?

130
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:29,052
Huh?

131
00:13:29,283 --> 00:13:30,353
Come on...

132
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:32,763
You know I'm gay, right?

133
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,818
If you invite me on a date,
I might lose all sense of reason.

134
00:13:37,315 --> 00:13:40,388
It's not a date. Just a geek activity.

135
00:13:41,472 --> 00:13:42,672
I see.

136
00:13:45,322 --> 00:13:47,396
I actually made a discovery.

137
00:13:47,923 --> 00:13:48,810
Go on.

138
00:13:49,302 --> 00:13:54,000
In episode 11, Kanata and Hazuki go to
a café for banana shakes, right?

139
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:56,795
Well, I found the place that
scene is based on.

140
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,870
I don't remember that scene.

141
00:13:58,895 --> 00:13:59,899
What?

142
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,826
I thought you were a huge geek?

143
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:04,220
Oh, wait!

144
00:14:04,414 --> 00:14:06,826
That scene! I just remembered!

145
00:14:08,094 --> 00:14:10,373
The café is in Shinjuku.

146
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,505
Not many geeks know about it, though.

147
00:14:14,369 --> 00:14:16,802
Wanna go there after the event on Saturday?

148
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,375
Yeah, let's go!

149
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,040
It's not a date though.

150
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,584
You don't need to tell me twice.

151
00:14:27,302 --> 00:14:30,950
(SATURDAY)

152
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,824
That's the place!

153
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:42,700
You're right! Nice find!

154
00:14:45,197 --> 00:14:47,157
- Let's go inside.
- Yeah.

155
00:14:54,678 --> 00:14:55,948
Welcome.

156
00:14:57,524 --> 00:15:00,998
Look! That's the table
where Kanata and Hazuki sat.

157
00:15:20,232 --> 00:15:22,080
May we sit here?

158
00:15:22,265 --> 00:15:24,365
Sure, go ahead.

159
00:15:26,069 --> 00:15:28,203
Two banana shakes, please.

160
00:15:31,662 --> 00:15:33,540
It's such a strange day.

161
00:15:33,806 --> 00:15:34,835
Why?

162
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:38,568
I don't usually sell many banana shakes.

163
00:15:46,187 --> 00:15:48,811
Maybe this place has gotten famous?

164
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,750
You might be right.

165
00:16:33,473 --> 00:16:34,698
Shit.

166
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:47,780
It's rare to see
lightbulbs like that nowadays.

167
00:16:48,494 --> 00:16:50,614
They're pretty retro, huh?

168
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,260
Why are our shakes taking so long?

169
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,510
- The table's free now.
- Sorry for the wait.

170
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,780
Here you go.

171
00:17:16,979 --> 00:17:18,059
Wait.

172
00:17:19,475 --> 00:17:21,475
Where did that customer go?

173
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,830
Oh, he just left.

174
00:17:24,534 --> 00:17:26,194
He did what!?

175
00:17:32,772 --> 00:17:34,292
I've been scammed.

176
00:17:35,993 --> 00:17:38,585
Wait, he left without paying?

177
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,780
No problem!

178
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,990
- I'll go catch him.
- What?

179
00:17:46,595 --> 00:17:51,295
Shirking the bill at a sacred Heaven's
Candy café is unbecoming of a geek!

180
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11,120
Are they in vogue now?

181
00:18:11,353 --> 00:18:12,393
Sorry?

182
00:18:13,242 --> 00:18:14,622
Banana shakes.

183
00:18:15,499 --> 00:18:17,577
Yeah, maybe.

184
00:18:19,716 --> 00:18:22,666
Not tapioca, huh?

185
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:32,632
Bottoms up!

186
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:15,499
Oh, you're back!

187
00:19:17,132 --> 00:19:18,832
Was the event fun?

188
00:19:21,924 --> 00:19:25,514
I left some omelet rice on the
table for dinner. Be sure to heat it up.

189
00:19:35,485 --> 00:19:36,885
Hold up!

190
00:20:02,643 --> 00:20:05,803
It's rare to see an owner
working in his own bar.

191
00:20:06,865 --> 00:20:08,125
I know, right?

192
00:20:08,231 --> 00:20:10,435
He has plenty of other bars,

193
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,845
so I don't know why he doesn't
just leave things to me.

194
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,750
I need to keep an eye on you from
time to time.

195
00:20:17,255 --> 00:20:20,315
Yusuke! Don't you trust me?

196
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:22,470
I trust your work, yes.

197
00:20:22,753 --> 00:20:25,913
But you've always been a flirt.

198
00:20:26,987 --> 00:20:30,944
I need to watch him in case
he picks up an undesirable lover.

199
00:20:32,285 --> 00:20:36,205
Satoshi, what do you think of this
jealous old man's ramblings?

200
00:20:36,245 --> 00:20:40,255
I'm envious! You two seem so close.

201
00:20:43,043 --> 00:20:44,853
How's things been with you lately?

202
00:20:44,878 --> 00:20:45,888
Huh?

203
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,139
You have a boyfriend, right?

204
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:50,800
Did you say he works at a market in Toyosu?

205
00:20:51,174 --> 00:20:52,604
Oh, him?

206
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,230
We broke up some time ago.

207
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,020
Oh, is that so?

208
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:58,725
Our lifestyles were completely out of sync.

209
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,180
He'd wake up at 2:30 each morning and
leave the house at 3:00.

210
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,880
That's not the morning. It's nighttime!

211
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,550
Well, I put up with it for three months.

212
00:21:12,183 --> 00:21:14,264
Do you have your eye on anyone now?

213
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,077
I actually went on a date today.

214
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,070
Oh! What's he like?

215
00:21:20,095 --> 00:21:21,755
A straight porn actor.

216
00:21:21,871 --> 00:21:24,161
Jeez, you like a challenge, huh!?

217
00:21:24,186 --> 00:21:27,075
I couldn't help myself!
He's simply adorable!

218
00:21:27,205 --> 00:21:29,615
Where did you go for the date?

219
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,990
Do you know an anime called
"Heaven's Candy"?

220
00:21:32,155 --> 00:21:33,605
Yeah, I do.

221
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,750
You watch it too?

222
00:21:36,325 --> 00:21:37,616
My son likes it.

223
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:39,460
I see.

224
00:21:40,135 --> 00:21:42,235
So, what about it?

225
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,060
There was a fan event.

226
00:21:44,398 --> 00:21:46,679
He invited me to go with him.

227
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,780
My son went to that same event.

228
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,670
Wait, are you a Heaven's Candy maniac?

229
00:21:52,701 --> 00:21:57,147
Nah, I'm not interested at all, but
I studied it in advance.

230
00:21:57,865 --> 00:21:59,625
I wanted to get his attention.

231
00:22:01,021 --> 00:22:03,751
A man in love is a brave man!

232
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:09,876
After the event,
we went on a kind of pilgrimage,

233
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:13,272
and visited the café that was
used as a reference in the anime.

234
00:22:13,825 --> 00:22:14,965
Was it fun?

235
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,460
I would say!

236
00:22:18,256 --> 00:22:22,487
Actually,
we ran into some trouble at the café.

237
00:22:24,501 --> 00:22:28,201
He says he lost his wallet and
hasn't got any money.

238
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,546
Do you want me to call the police?

239
00:22:36,378 --> 00:22:38,210
Is it worth it?

240
00:22:40,365 --> 00:22:42,495
I'll pay on his behalf.

241
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,046
It's not good that he ran off like that,

242
00:22:50,214 --> 00:22:54,474
but us Heaven's Candy geeks need to
help each other out when in trouble.

243
00:22:55,029 --> 00:22:56,249
Does this cover it?

244
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:01,540
Let me get your change.

245
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,885
So you didn't call the police after all?

246
00:23:10,988 --> 00:23:12,046
Nah.

247
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:16,350
Still, that's pretty brave of you to chase
after that guy like that.

248
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,950
I wanted to show my date how cool I am.

249
00:23:20,785 --> 00:23:24,845
Acting righteous is fine and all,
but what if the guy was carrying a knife?

250
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,050
You gotta be careful!

251
00:23:26,214 --> 00:23:29,694
It was fine! He was
just a weak-looking anime nerd.

252
00:23:32,392 --> 00:23:34,362
You don't think it was Takato, do you?

253
00:23:35,068 --> 00:23:37,327
He would never do something like that!

254
00:23:39,865 --> 00:23:43,413
What happened with your date after that?

255
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,718
We drank banana shakes and went home.

256
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,280
Is that all?

257
00:23:47,517 --> 00:23:48,597
That's all.

258
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:50,339
What a waste!

259
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,310
It's fine by me. He's straight anyway.

260
00:23:54,556 --> 00:23:57,686
I'll slowly close in on him
before making my move.

261
00:24:20,332 --> 00:24:22,102
Now that I think about it,

262
00:24:22,493 --> 00:24:25,433
the first time I met Towa,

263
00:24:26,793 --> 00:24:29,702
I totally fell in love.

264
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,944
It's not good that he ran off like that,

265
00:24:36,596 --> 00:24:40,636
but us Heaven's Candy geeks need to
help each other out when in trouble.

266
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,100
Does this cover it?

267
00:24:52,827 --> 00:24:54,057
This is great!

268
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:13,694
I'm sorry about yesterday.

269
00:25:18,112 --> 00:25:19,772
I have a favor to ask.

270
00:25:24,244 --> 00:25:26,999
This is yesterday's payment.

271
00:25:28,309 --> 00:25:29,309
Huh?

272
00:25:29,595 --> 00:25:32,624
If that guy comes back,
can you give this to him?

273
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,647
I appreciate the sentiment, but...

274
00:25:37,173 --> 00:25:42,350
yesterday was the first time he came here,
and who can say if he'll ever come back?

275
00:25:44,341 --> 00:25:46,327
Didn't you ask him for his contact details?

276
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,440
I see.

277
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,991
Well, I guess I can hold on to that
if you want.

278
00:25:57,094 --> 00:25:58,804
Please do.

279
00:26:02,754 --> 00:26:04,074
Welcome.

280
00:26:04,893 --> 00:26:06,050
Oh.

281
00:26:08,285 --> 00:26:09,555
Oh.

282
00:26:09,962 --> 00:26:11,062
Oh.

283
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:18,179
Don't mind if I do.

284
00:26:24,373 --> 00:26:26,764
I'm totally hooked after
drinking this yesterday.

285
00:26:33,257 --> 00:26:34,680
I'm surprised -

286
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:38,249
that other Heaven's Candy geeks
beside me knew about this place.

287
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:44,452
I found it online by searching each café
in the country one by one.

288
00:26:45,341 --> 00:26:48,842
That's incredible!
Did you find anything else?

289
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,147
I know the anime is set in Okinawa,

290
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,791
but I found some beach spots in Ibaraki -

291
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:59,569
that were used as a base for
certain scenes.

292
00:27:00,782 --> 00:27:05,139
You mean the lighthouse on the
cliff in episode 83, right?

293
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:09,085
That's right! You know your stuff!

294
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:12,249
I went there too!

295
00:27:14,003 --> 00:27:15,173
You did?

296
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,160
How about you?

297
00:27:18,963 --> 00:27:20,257
I haven't been there.

298
00:27:21,213 --> 00:27:23,944
Well, why don't we go there together?

299
00:27:25,233 --> 00:27:26,243
Huh?

300
00:27:39,444 --> 00:27:40,725
Hey, Takato.

301
00:27:41,150 --> 00:27:42,510
Let's take a pic together.

302
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:43,600
Oh?

303
00:27:52,004 --> 00:27:54,452
What's with the stern face?

304
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,190
What?

305
00:27:56,772 --> 00:27:58,546
Come on, gimme a smile!

306
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,405
Man, I love the sea!

307
00:28:22,422 --> 00:28:23,922
Hey, Takato.

308
00:28:24,507 --> 00:28:26,936
There's another base location nearby.

309
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,860
Wanna check it out?

310
00:28:29,635 --> 00:28:30,685
There is?

311
00:28:45,571 --> 00:28:48,702
In the anime, this place is called
"Motel Sunrise."

312
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,233
You're right!

313
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:54,452
The sign is the same shape!

314
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,460
Hey, wanna take a look inside?

315
00:29:03,938 --> 00:29:05,258
What?

316
00:29:18,012 --> 00:29:19,350
Let's go inside!

317
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,944
Hold up, this is a love hotel!

318
00:29:24,278 --> 00:29:26,733
Who cares?
We came all this way, right?

319
00:29:27,371 --> 00:29:28,411
Let's go.

320
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:32,587
Wait.

321
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,140
Don't be a drag!

322
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,690
The wallpaper is a different color, huh?

323
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:46,686
The bed is the same, though!

324
00:29:47,181 --> 00:29:49,021
Yeah...

325
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,214
The bathroom is identical, too.

326
00:29:55,553 --> 00:29:56,784
You hungry?

327
00:29:57,707 --> 00:29:59,377
Let's order something.

328
00:30:08,549 --> 00:30:09,721
What's wrong?

329
00:30:10,075 --> 00:30:11,253
Take a seat.

330
00:30:12,697 --> 00:30:14,257
Right.

331
00:30:18,291 --> 00:30:20,190
Shall we spend the night here?

332
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,292
What?

333
00:30:22,953 --> 00:30:24,260
I'm having a blast!

334
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,323
I wanna talk about more
geek stuff with you.

335
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:41,485
Most of the food at love hotels is frozen,

336
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:44,034
but sometimes they have
something good.

337
00:30:45,475 --> 00:30:47,792
Like the chicken and rice is frozen,

338
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,940
but they fry the eggs and
serve them as an omelet.

339
00:30:53,995 --> 00:30:58,089
Towa, you seem really familiar with
love hotels.

340
00:31:00,256 --> 00:31:01,286
Huh?

341
00:31:05,348 --> 00:31:07,300
I frequent them a lot for work.

342
00:31:08,047 --> 00:31:09,940
Mostly love hotels in the city.

343
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,073
For work?

344
00:31:13,978 --> 00:31:15,604
I'm an actor.

345
00:31:17,804 --> 00:31:18,974
An actor?

346
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,385
A porn actor.

347
00:31:22,771 --> 00:31:23,745
What?

348
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:27,229
Towa, is that you in...

349
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,229
You saw my parody porn?

350
00:31:35,219 --> 00:31:36,050
Yeah.

351
00:31:36,876 --> 00:31:37,926
I did.

352
00:31:38,544 --> 00:31:39,971
And you only just realized now?

353
00:31:44,883 --> 00:31:46,112
Well...

354
00:31:47,356 --> 00:31:49,503
I was wearing
color contact lenses and a wig.

355
00:31:59,315 --> 00:32:02,839
What do you do for a living?

356
00:32:07,456 --> 00:32:13,284
My mom died four years ago, and I've been
living like a hermit ever since.

357
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,590
Is that so?

358
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:20,838
Aren't you gonna ask why?

359
00:32:21,484 --> 00:32:22,484
Huh?

360
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,362
Why I live like a hermit.

361
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,500
Tell me.

362
00:32:35,577 --> 00:32:37,510
After my mom died...

363
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:43,610
(FOUR YEARS EARLIER)

364
00:32:51,657 --> 00:32:52,721
Etsuko.

365
00:32:53,678 --> 00:32:56,558
You left us without knowing a thing.

366
00:33:01,339 --> 00:33:02,510
You want to talk to me?

367
00:33:02,713 --> 00:33:05,096
Yeah, take a seat.

368
00:33:17,523 --> 00:33:19,550
Takato, are you struggling?

369
00:33:23,277 --> 00:33:25,776
Cause I most definitely am!

370
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:33,434
But I'm positive that your mother
would want us both

371
00:33:33,459 --> 00:33:35,198
to keep moving forward.

372
00:33:42,848 --> 00:33:44,081
In truth,

373
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:47,510
there's something I couldn't tell her
before she died.

374
00:33:50,107 --> 00:33:50,956
What's that?

375
00:33:52,857 --> 00:33:55,659
You're my only living flesh and blood.

376
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:04,042
That's why I've decided to be honest
and hide nothing from you.

377
00:34:06,484 --> 00:34:08,190
Just tell me already!

378
00:34:09,221 --> 00:34:11,901
Very well. Please be calm and
listen carefully.

379
00:34:12,963 --> 00:34:15,268
I'm gay.

380
00:34:19,628 --> 00:34:20,651
What?

381
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:25,880
Of course, I truly loved your mother
from the bottom of my heart.

382
00:34:26,188 --> 00:34:29,557
Make no mistake, you were born from
the love we had for each other!

383
00:34:31,711 --> 00:34:33,300
Are you saying that you

384
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:36,550
lied to me and mom all this time!?

385
00:34:39,362 --> 00:34:40,642
Yes.

386
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:46,720
Unfortunately...

387
00:34:48,417 --> 00:34:49,987
I didn't get to come clean.

388
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:20,900
Now I'm living in the same house as
my father and his partner.

389
00:35:23,732 --> 00:35:25,352
By partner you mean...

390
00:35:25,948 --> 00:35:28,049
a man?

391
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:40,971
Shinya was working at
my father's host club.

392
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:45,799
But he stopped working as a host, and
became a manager.

393
00:35:47,132 --> 00:35:52,463
He's a really nice guy, and seems to
care about me more than my father does,

394
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:55,494
but I don't know how to talk to him.

395
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,340
Things must be pretty complicated, huh?

396
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:08,307
I even saw them at it.

397
00:36:10,273 --> 00:36:11,713
At what?

398
00:36:13,491 --> 00:36:14,947
Making love.

399
00:36:15,346 --> 00:36:16,650
Does it feel good?

400
00:36:17,456 --> 00:36:18,726
Yeah, it does!

401
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:21,406
Yusuke!

402
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,760
Don't stop!

403
00:36:32,131 --> 00:36:33,768
Your turn to move.

404
00:36:47,067 --> 00:36:48,517
Yusuke...

405
00:36:48,854 --> 00:36:50,285
Do you like it?

406
00:36:50,310 --> 00:36:52,280
You bet!

407
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,420
It feels so good!

408
00:36:57,453 --> 00:36:59,323
Oh, wow!

409
00:37:01,932 --> 00:37:03,350
I love it!

410
00:37:07,706 --> 00:37:09,126
How about this?

411
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:11,715
Woah, hold up!

412
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,619
I was beyond shocked.

413
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:17,322
I regularly watched adult anime

414
00:37:17,961 --> 00:37:20,385
and played those kind of video games,

415
00:37:21,523 --> 00:37:24,572
but after seeing that,
I completely stopped.

416
00:37:26,923 --> 00:37:28,573
I'm the same.

417
00:37:30,314 --> 00:37:32,854
I have a lot of sex at work,

418
00:37:35,649 --> 00:37:39,127
but I'm unable to love anybody for real.

419
00:38:30,611 --> 00:38:31,994
Takato?

420
00:38:35,984 --> 00:38:37,274
Suck it.

421
00:38:49,249 --> 00:38:55,659
I still can't believe
I did what I did that day.

422
00:38:57,234 --> 00:38:59,904
But what's even more unbelievable

423
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:03,260
was that Towa agreed to do it.

424
00:39:12,261 --> 00:39:14,671
I fell completely in love with him.

425
00:39:15,508 --> 00:39:18,964
I think Towa felt the same way, too.

426
00:39:34,584 --> 00:39:38,144
This is my first time doing this.

427
00:39:38,169 --> 00:39:39,457
Me too.

428
00:39:41,181 --> 00:39:43,330
I thought I would be a virgin forever.

429
00:39:45,578 --> 00:39:46,888
Takato...

430
00:40:07,868 --> 00:40:09,148
Takato!

431
00:40:57,670 --> 00:41:00,150
That feels so good!

432
00:41:03,430 --> 00:41:05,018
Takato!

433
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,963
Don't stop!

434
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,775
Takato!

435
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:19,240
I think I'm gonna...

436
00:41:19,707 --> 00:41:21,182
cum!

437
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,494
Keep going!

438
00:41:49,361 --> 00:41:52,521
I think we are alike.

439
00:41:53,727 --> 00:41:54,817
Really?

440
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:02,970
My parents divorced when I was in
middle school, and my mother moved out.

441
00:42:05,185 --> 00:42:07,947
My father remarried a younger woman,

442
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,549
and the three of us began living together.

443
00:42:16,699 --> 00:42:19,791
She was the first person I had sex with.

444
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:26,182
She seduced me one day when
my father was out.

445
00:42:27,790 --> 00:42:29,650
We did it many times after that.

446
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:38,541
To be honest, it felt really good.

447
00:42:39,305 --> 00:42:41,525
There were even times I asked her for sex.

448
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:46,658
But she is my mother-in-law,

449
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:51,963
so I had to tell myself not to
fall in love with her.

450
00:42:55,142 --> 00:43:01,119
Maybe that's why I still can't
fall in love with others.

451
00:43:03,406 --> 00:43:06,408
Like some kind of trauma?

452
00:43:07,778 --> 00:43:09,088
Yeah.

453
00:43:11,731 --> 00:43:13,101
But...

454
00:43:13,697 --> 00:43:17,385
I feel I can change that
when I'm with you.

455
00:43:22,046 --> 00:43:23,361
Me too...

456
00:43:24,197 --> 00:43:25,416
Towa.

457
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:43,400
Today's curry tastes different from usual.

458
00:43:44,516 --> 00:43:45,682
You noticed?

459
00:43:46,182 --> 00:43:50,291
I forgot to buy chutney, so
I tried using vinegar and chocolate.

460
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,345
It tastes great!

461
00:43:52,741 --> 00:43:54,220
It has a mature taste.

462
00:43:54,790 --> 00:43:55,980
Really?

463
00:44:01,668 --> 00:44:02,760
So, I was thinking...

464
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:04,338
Huh?

465
00:44:05,484 --> 00:44:07,266
It's time I got a job.

466
00:44:08,536 --> 00:44:09,541
What?

467
00:44:10,763 --> 00:44:13,463
Can I work for you?

468
00:44:17,291 --> 00:44:18,439
No go?

469
00:44:20,378 --> 00:44:22,668
Of course you can!

470
00:44:23,197 --> 00:44:26,564
Do you wanna work as a host?
At a club? Or a steakhouse?

471
00:44:26,918 --> 00:44:30,033
We're low on staff everywhere, so
you can choose whichever!

472
00:44:31,025 --> 00:44:32,835
I wanna work at Shinya's bar.

473
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:33,891
Oh?

474
00:44:34,351 --> 00:44:37,189
I'd be happy to learn the ropes from you.

475
00:44:38,826 --> 00:44:41,354
Of course! What do you say, Yusuke?

476
00:44:42,578 --> 00:44:43,628
Yeah!

477
00:44:44,508 --> 00:44:46,424
Thank you in advance.

478
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:54,377
Takato...

479
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:57,221
I'm so happy!

480
00:45:00,916 --> 00:45:02,126
Shinya!

481
00:45:05,741 --> 00:45:06,901
Here.

482
00:45:36,071 --> 00:45:37,846
I got you a moving gift.

483
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,470
Thank you.

484
00:45:45,155 --> 00:45:46,947
How old is this building?

485
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:50,119
Around 30 years?

486
00:45:50,765 --> 00:45:53,510
Wow! You did well to find it.

487
00:45:54,463 --> 00:45:56,166
I wanted to become independent.

488
00:45:59,019 --> 00:46:00,579
How's work?

489
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:01,900
Going well?

490
00:46:02,363 --> 00:46:03,373
Yeah.

491
00:46:04,491 --> 00:46:07,854
The manager is very kind
when training me.

492
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:22,981
What's this?

493
00:46:24,369 --> 00:46:28,619
Oh, this? The actress I was working
with today did that.

494
00:46:29,752 --> 00:46:30,802
What?

495
00:46:30,827 --> 00:46:32,337
It's a love bite.

496
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:37,682
She's new to the industry and gets
a little crazy when she's turned on.

497
00:46:47,393 --> 00:46:49,750
What are you doing?

498
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:53,510
Hey, calm down! You're hurting me!

499
00:46:58,765 --> 00:47:02,814
I wanna leave my mark on you, too.

500
00:47:09,852 --> 00:47:13,705
And I want you to leave a mark on me.

501
00:47:20,540 --> 00:47:21,860
Takato!

502
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:07,569
I was yet to realize that the emotions
I was feeling were jealousy.

503
00:48:13,964 --> 00:48:20,554
I just desperately wanted to be
Towa's one and only.

504
00:48:40,598 --> 00:48:44,432
(ONE MONTH LATER)

505
00:49:04,275 --> 00:49:07,950
I must have used the wrong amount
of water. It seems a little burnt.

506
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:10,195
Not at all. It's good.

507
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,140
Really?

508
00:49:20,313 --> 00:49:22,723
Yeah, it's burnt. Let me make some more.

509
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,530
It's fine!

510
00:49:25,084 --> 00:49:28,127
I'm just happy that you made it for me!

511
00:49:29,879 --> 00:49:30,971
I see.

512
00:49:31,626 --> 00:49:32,746
Okay.

513
00:49:38,507 --> 00:49:39,507
Open wide.

514
00:49:46,361 --> 00:49:47,424
It tastes good.

515
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,700
You're lying. Lemme make some more.

516
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,830
- I'm not lying!
- You're forcing yourself!

517
00:49:51,830 --> 00:49:54,400
- No, I'm not!
- You definitely are!

518
00:49:54,548 --> 00:49:56,033
I want to eat it!

519
00:50:01,432 --> 00:50:02,361
Here.

520
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:05,736
Shinya's come down with a fever.

521
00:50:09,371 --> 00:50:10,978
Yeah, he'll be fine.

522
00:50:11,243 --> 00:50:12,650
It's just a cold.

523
00:50:13,563 --> 00:50:15,564
He took some meds and fell asleep.

524
00:50:19,268 --> 00:50:23,119
He's in no shape to work, so
you can close for tonight.

525
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:25,557
I'm not closing.

526
00:50:27,268 --> 00:50:28,463
It's no problem.

527
00:50:29,071 --> 00:50:30,400
I'll run it by myself.

528
00:50:31,118 --> 00:50:32,236
I see.

529
00:50:33,410 --> 00:50:34,197
Yeah.

530
00:50:34,765 --> 00:50:36,065
Got it.

531
00:50:37,731 --> 00:50:38,525
Okay.

532
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:40,380
I'll tell him.

533
00:50:46,337 --> 00:50:49,635
Takato said to get well soon.

534
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:57,674
You know, I'm sure I've seen
you somewhere before.

535
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,229
Never mind. I can't remember where.

536
00:51:13,017 --> 00:51:15,143
So, what time you open until?

537
00:51:15,818 --> 00:51:16,883
Excuse me?

538
00:51:17,122 --> 00:51:19,471
Wanna go somewhere after?

539
00:51:29,441 --> 00:51:30,571
Wait.

540
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:32,670
Where are we going?

541
00:52:03,699 --> 00:52:07,819
You're definitely not how you seem.

542
00:52:11,684 --> 00:52:12,963
Hey, Towa...

543
00:52:13,738 --> 00:52:18,580
Are you screwing a girl
you don't even like right now?

544
00:52:22,226 --> 00:52:26,636
I want to know how that feels.

545
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:32,682
I want you to know how painful this feels.

546
00:52:36,083 --> 00:52:40,872
Right now, I'm screwing a guy
I have no interest in.

547
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:48,910
I'm gonna cum!

548
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:55,620
I'll cum!

549
00:54:04,407 --> 00:54:05,967
I love you.

550
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:07,920
I love you.

551
00:54:09,186 --> 00:54:10,566
I love you.

552
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,750
I love you!

553
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:22,491
Towa...

554
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:27,861
I love you so much it's killing me.

555
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:53,057
Huh?

556
00:54:53,899 --> 00:54:55,089
Towa?

557
00:54:57,145 --> 00:54:59,245
Why is Satoshi here?

558
00:55:05,067 --> 00:55:06,369
What's going on?

559
00:55:10,427 --> 00:55:12,916
Takato, what are you up to!?

560
00:55:15,245 --> 00:55:16,455
Don't you get it?

561
00:55:17,659 --> 00:55:18,829
What?

562
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:23,322
Seeing you do the same is
driving me insane!

563
00:55:47,523 --> 00:55:49,049
I remember now.

564
00:55:49,491 --> 00:55:51,830
You were at the café.

565
00:56:19,131 --> 00:56:24,061
I understand that
Towa is just doing his job.

566
00:56:24,914 --> 00:56:29,283
But when I imagine him doing
it with a woman,

567
00:56:29,769 --> 00:56:31,596
I start to lose my mind.

568
00:56:35,354 --> 00:56:36,404
I'm sorry.

569
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:42,416
But you're the only person
I can talk to about this.

570
00:56:44,215 --> 00:56:46,365
Not at all. I'm glad to hear that.

571
00:56:46,390 --> 00:56:49,619
I feel like a mother talking about
love with her daughter.

572
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:57,100
I haven't been able to reach him
since that night.

573
00:56:57,737 --> 00:56:59,877
Don't you know where he lives?

574
00:57:03,549 --> 00:57:05,875
Howdy. Just dropping by to see
how you're doing.

575
00:57:05,900 --> 00:57:08,990
- Can I get you a drink?
- Nah, I'll be leaving soon.

576
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:12,447
I have a meeting about
a new place in Roppongi.

577
00:57:13,455 --> 00:57:15,986
I know it's sudden, but
can you join me?

578
00:57:16,604 --> 00:57:18,480
But we're just about to open.

579
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:20,480
You don't need to worry about that.

580
00:57:20,755 --> 00:57:24,330
Takato took good care of this
place when you were sick. Right?

581
00:57:24,754 --> 00:57:25,792
Yeah.

582
00:57:26,858 --> 00:57:28,058
Very well.

583
00:57:28,518 --> 00:57:30,600
Takato, the bar's in your hands.

584
00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:31,925
Understood.

585
00:57:32,118 --> 00:57:34,068
Okay, let's go.

586
00:57:41,681 --> 00:57:43,341
Thanks for this.

587
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:45,350
Shinya, I'll be waiting out back.

588
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:46,486
Okay!

589
00:58:00,474 --> 00:58:03,439
Man, I love the sea!

590
00:58:10,428 --> 00:58:11,958
Hey, Takato.

591
00:58:12,587 --> 00:58:15,417
There's another base location nearby.

592
00:58:15,470 --> 00:58:16,750
Wanna check it out?

593
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:18,750
There is?

594
00:58:40,466 --> 00:58:43,656
Towa, I miss you.

595
00:58:46,710 --> 00:58:49,455
It's been a while since the three of us
had dinner together.

596
00:58:50,013 --> 00:58:51,163
Yeah!

597
00:58:52,185 --> 00:58:54,806
Takato, have you gotten
used to living alone?

598
00:58:55,472 --> 00:58:56,579
Yeah.

599
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:00,064
Actually, there's a reason
I invited you over for dinner.

600
00:59:01,365 --> 00:59:02,565
What's that?

601
00:59:04,152 --> 00:59:08,352
Remember I said
I'm opening a place in Roppongi?

602
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:11,486
Well, I want Shinya to manage it,

603
00:59:11,899 --> 00:59:14,096
and hoped you could take over
your current bar.

604
00:59:19,344 --> 00:59:20,580
Is that a problem?

605
00:59:23,555 --> 00:59:24,685
No.

606
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:26,041
I'll do it.

607
00:59:29,830 --> 00:59:31,260
I see!

608
00:59:31,885 --> 00:59:33,825
Well, that's great!

609
00:59:43,489 --> 00:59:45,830
Towa quit acting, apparently.

610
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:48,736
Seriously?

611
00:59:50,354 --> 00:59:52,189
That's what I heard.

612
00:59:54,613 --> 00:59:56,674
Maybe he moved back to the countryside.

613
00:59:58,418 --> 01:00:00,330
Where in the countryside is he from?

614
01:00:00,779 --> 01:00:03,049
That's just a guess on my part.

615
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:07,713
I heard his apartment was repossessed too.

616
01:00:36,844 --> 01:00:37,924
Takato.

617
01:00:38,219 --> 01:00:39,629
Welcome home.

618
01:00:40,256 --> 01:00:41,736
Why are you here?

619
01:00:53,204 --> 01:00:56,479
I want to make love to you.

620
01:01:29,870 --> 01:01:32,299
I'm totally hooked after
drinking this yesterday.

621
01:01:37,549 --> 01:01:41,893
You mean the lighthouse on the
cliff in episode 83, right?

622
01:01:42,989 --> 01:01:46,679
That's incredible!
Did you find anything else?

623
01:01:51,298 --> 01:01:53,705
What's with the stern face?

624
01:01:54,310 --> 01:01:55,420
What?

625
01:01:56,651 --> 01:02:00,031
Towa, you seem really familiar
with love hotels.

626
01:02:08,637 --> 01:02:09,917
Towa...

627
01:02:10,621 --> 01:02:14,236
I dream about you every night.

628
01:02:23,154 --> 01:02:24,454
Towa...

629
01:02:25,572 --> 01:02:26,877
Where are you?

630
01:02:27,963 --> 01:02:29,753
What are you doing?

631
01:02:39,565 --> 01:02:40,557
Towa...

632
01:02:41,195 --> 01:02:42,502
I miss you.

633
01:02:53,109 --> 01:02:54,829
Here's your change.

634
01:02:55,132 --> 01:02:57,022
Thanks as always.

635
01:03:08,877 --> 01:03:10,187
Welcome.

636
01:03:18,653 --> 01:03:19,803
Hold up.

637
01:03:20,980 --> 01:03:23,340
The customer who was sat there.

638
01:03:24,300 --> 01:03:25,300
Huh?

639
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:27,960
Was it him?

640
01:03:28,918 --> 01:03:29,708
No.

641
01:03:30,427 --> 01:03:32,337
It was a girl.

642
01:03:32,946 --> 01:03:37,926
She said she was a fan of
that anime, too.

643
01:04:07,141 --> 01:04:09,630
Sorry, we don't open until 8 p.m.

644
01:04:17,936 --> 01:04:20,997
I saw that you're hiring.

645
01:04:23,509 --> 01:04:27,482
I don't suppose you'll let me work here?

646
01:04:32,256 --> 01:04:36,266
(NOW HIRING)

647
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:45,089
Etsuko.

648
01:04:45,825 --> 01:04:47,958
Takato has become a fine young man.

649
01:04:51,036 --> 01:04:53,431
He's doing a grand job running the bar,

650
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:55,966
and he's found himself a nice partner.

651
01:04:59,641 --> 01:05:03,208
Please continue to
watch over and protect us.

652
01:05:05,622 --> 01:05:08,044
Yusuke! Dinner's ready!

653
01:05:08,603 --> 01:05:09,883
Coming!

654
01:05:39,068 --> 01:05:42,833
I couldn't stop thinking about you.

655
01:05:44,931 --> 01:05:46,591
Same here.

656
01:06:07,051 --> 01:06:08,911
I finally understand how I feel.

657
01:06:09,107 --> 01:06:12,036
I don't ever wanna let you go.

658
01:06:13,954 --> 01:06:17,185
I don't wanna lose you again either.

659
01:06:26,149 --> 01:06:27,509
Towa...

660
01:06:28,493 --> 01:06:32,713
We have become one again.

661
01:06:38,310 --> 01:06:40,052
I love you, Towa.

662
01:06:40,872 --> 01:06:42,646
We'll always be together!

663
01:08:24,618 --> 01:08:27,373
I made you an original cocktail.

664
01:08:29,122 --> 01:08:30,380
Give it a try.

665
01:08:31,298 --> 01:08:32,348
Sure.

666
01:08:41,596 --> 01:08:43,576
It tastes like a banana shake!

667
01:08:44,482 --> 01:08:46,654
The café owner told me the recipe.

668
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:48,935
This tastes great!

669
01:08:49,242 --> 01:08:50,607
Let's put it on the menu!

670
01:08:51,185 --> 01:08:53,435
Seriously? I'm so happy!

671
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:56,787
It's a memorable flavor for both of us.

672
01:08:57,710 --> 01:09:00,310
Let's give it a special cocktail name.

673
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:04,099
A special name?

674
01:09:05,465 --> 01:09:07,245
What would sound good?

675
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:10,236
I got it.

676
01:09:10,837 --> 01:09:12,412
How about "Eternal Banana"?

677
01:09:12,989 --> 01:09:14,469
Same meaning as your name.

678
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:17,355
Isn't that too on the nose?

679
01:09:17,380 --> 01:09:18,974
Sounds kinda obscene.

680
01:09:23,708 --> 01:09:24,928
Hey, Towa.

681
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:26,910
What is it?

682
01:09:31,434 --> 01:09:32,843
I wanna fuck.

683
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:36,340
We can't! We're about to open!

684
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,005
Come on. Just a little.

685
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:40,680
No way! You never stop at a little!

686
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:43,326
- Quit protesting!
- But we can't!

687
01:09:44,290 --> 01:09:46,878
Hey, calm down already!

688
01:09:48,290 --> 01:09:49,810
Takato, stop!

689
01:09:50,020 --> 01:09:52,125
We can't be doing this!

690
01:09:52,150 --> 01:09:54,500
You're being too rough!

691
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:58,701
- I'm enjoying your Eternal Banana!
- Quit screwing around!
