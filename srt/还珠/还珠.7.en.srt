The Long Ballad

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Long Ballad

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The Long Ballad

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The Long Ballad

5
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
This note is...

7
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The maid said that this note was written by Ling'er to Lord Jing.

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
This girl is so good at playing tricks.

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Don't worry, Your Highness.

10
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It must be that Ling'er's love.

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Lord Jing is so smart.

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
He's not someone who doesn't value his love.

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Smart?

14
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Smartness is not worth mentioning in front of Qing'ai.

15
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
And love is not worth mentioning in front of Huang Quan.

16
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Why don't Your Highness give her a few words?

17
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
She will understand.

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
It's time to knock.

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
We can't let her walk the old path of dreaming and living.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Yuan'er, I came to see you.

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Your Highness, I just got pregnant.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I didn't know that Your Highness would suddenly visit.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I was rude.

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I hope Your Highness will forgive me.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Are you still seeing me?

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's your birthday in a few days.

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Every year at this time,

28
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I want to prepare a meal for you.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You child,

30
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
you are never allowed to be celebrated with people.

31
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You are always a bit lonely.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
A person will be lonely.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm used to being alone.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
It's a great blessing to have your favor.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Not to mention that you have to take care of me personally.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
It's just that I'm really not comfortable.

37
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Can you please go back to Kunming Palace first?

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'll quickly organize the clothes

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
and then go to greet you.

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
They all say that you look like an orphan.

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You are indeed right.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
But the camp in the Forbidden City

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
must be carried high.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You must not bow your head to the ground.

45
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Since it's not convenient for you,

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
it's already late.

47
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll go back first.

48
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll eat the birthday noodles later.

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll let you rest in peace.

50
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll see you off, Your Highness.

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Yuan'er,

52
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
are you all right?

53
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Your Highness,

54
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I accidentally slipped and fell earlier.

55
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I accidentally hit you with my palm.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Let me remind you.

58
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
After your parents died,

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm the only one who can protect you.

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm the only one who can protect you.

61
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm the only one who can protect you.

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm the only one who can protect you.

63
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm the only one who can protect you.

64
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
From now on,

65
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
everything you have now

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
is my gift to you.

67
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Remember to listen to me at all times.

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
You must give the Ula-Nara family a good name.

69
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Don't let the ancestors be ashamed again.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Don't forget your ungrateful mother.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The famous pearl of the Ula-Nara family.

72
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
She eloped with someone, gave birth to you, abandoned you.

73
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Now your existence is a stain on the family.

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Now I'm giving you a chance to prove yourself.

75
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
You can't repeat your mother's mistakes.

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Kill the gods and protect the interests.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Hate the sea and love the sky.

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Life and death.

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
One line.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
So her life is because of me.

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Yuan'er, remember.

82
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Anyone who hinders your future

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
and delays your future life,

84
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I will never forgive them.

85
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You are a pure and kind person.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't be blinded by some woman who is heartless.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
If you have any problem,

88
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I will deal with it for you.

89
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I said I wanted a wolf to cry and a man to sleep.

90
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
But I never thought

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
she would go through so much hardship and humiliation.

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
The world is beautiful, but it's all fake.

93
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
My mother has made a mistake once.

94
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I can't make another mistake.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I hate the sea and love the sky.

96
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Let her suffer all these years.

97
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's okay.

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The past can't be chased.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
But in the future,

100
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I can give her more.

101
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
If she is a cold mountain,

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I will be in trouble.

103
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Ziwen, you are in the palace.

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's you.

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Miss, last time you saved my life,

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I didn't have time to pay my respects.

108
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Don't be so polite.

109
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We are like sisters.

110
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Don't be so polite.

111
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Sisters?

112
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Xiao Yanzi and I are good friends.

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You and Xiao Yanzi are good friends too.

114
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
In this way,

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
we are all good friends.

116
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Where is Jinsuo?

117
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Didn't Jinsuo come into the palace with you?

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Jinsuo?

119
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Who is she?

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Jinsuo?

121
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Jinsuo?

122
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
You don't know Jinsuo?

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
No way.

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Jinsuo's important role is gone.

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Did she delete it?

126
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Impossible.

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Absolutely impossible.

128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Miss.

129
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Miss.

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Miss.

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Xiao Yanzi,

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
look who is here.

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Ling'er.

134
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Hurry up.

135
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You are here just in time.

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Sit down.

137
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Have a try.

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The real milk I made,

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
is it authentic?

140
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Have a try.

141
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You made it.

142
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Let me taste it.

143
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's good.

144
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's good.

145
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I made it.

146
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
You made it, Ziwei.

147
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Like this.

148
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Like this.

149
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Ziwei and Xiao Yanzi.

150
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I am really with them.

151
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Who taught you to make it?

152
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
It's so magical.

153
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
My dream finally came true.

154
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
When the wind doesn't stop,

155
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
the river will stop flowing.

156
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
When time stops,

157
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
the sun and the moon don't separate.

158
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:36,000
When the world is not as it should be,

159
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I still can't break up with you.

160
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I can't break up with you.

161
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Your tenderness

162
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
is the biggest protection in my life.

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I do it for myself.

164
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Ziwei, you are hurt.

165
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Xiao Yanzi, be careful.

166
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
But your lantern is so beautiful.

167
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Right?

168
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
What are you doing?

169
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Come on.

170
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Fruits.

171
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Put them here.

172
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Ziwei, look.

173
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Put all these mushrooms together.

174
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Small table.

175
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Can you do it?

176
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Can you?

177
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Let me do it.

178
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Xiao Yanzi, Ziwei.

179
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Someone is coming.

180
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It smells good.

181
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
If you have a chance,

182
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
don't eat it.

183
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Someone is coming.

184
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's okay if you don't invite yourself.

185
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I don't like people who can eat poison.

186
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Let's go to work.

187
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Where are you taking me?

188
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
This dish is so cute.

189
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
And it has some purple and red.

190
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Please give it to Ya Ning.

191
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
It's called

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Red-tongued Green-eagle.

193
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Ling'er,

194
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
we went to a place.

195
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Interesting.

196
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
The music is beautiful.

197
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
The culture is elegant.

198
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I can't see that you have a good taste in literature.

199
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
May I ask what's the origin of the poem?

200
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
It's a miracle.

201
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You can't believe it.

202
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Xiao Yanzi,

203
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
this is the silver throne that the fifth prince gave you.

204
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
It's okay if you don't say you're in love.

205
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
But if you say you're in love,

206
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'll be so embarrassed.

207
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I just remember that day,

208
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
you gave me a sword.

209
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I almost got hurt today

210
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
because I wanted to fight with you.

211
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
You just don't thank me.

212
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
You got hurt because you're not good at martial arts.

213
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
You even hurt me.

214
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm not good at martial arts?

215
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You...

216
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
You're unreasonable.

217
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
You said I'm unreasonable.

218
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
You're unreasonable.

219
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I...

220
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I...

221
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Yongqi.

222
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,000
You're so good.

223
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Why did you get hurt?

224
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Teach me.

225
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You're unreasonable.

226
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
You're unreasonable.

227
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Yongqi.

228
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
I'm Xiao Yanzi.

229
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I'm not like this.

230
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Teach me.

231
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Okay.

232
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Come on.

233
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Let's raise a toast.

234
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
The first toast

235
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
is to celebrate that we're all together in the study.

236
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
We hope that we'll never be apart from each other

237
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
and we hope that we'll never lose our heads.

238
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Okay.

239
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
We'll never be apart from each other.

240
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Cheers.

241
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Cheers.

242
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Today, General,

243
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
we're not meant to be.

244
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
We're not for anything else.

245
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
We're just for love.

246
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
It reminds me of the poem by Li Tai Bai.

247
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's about raising a cow and raising a calf.

248
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It takes 300 cups of wine.

249
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
300 cups?

250
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Who drinks 300 cups?

251
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Xiao Yanzi drinks 300 cups.

252
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Okay.

253
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'll drink 300 cups.

254
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Next year,

255
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'll wait to watch the play of Shu Feng Zhai every day.

256
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I can only watch one episode a day.

257
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Now I'm here

258
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
with the leading role, Hong Chen,

259
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
and I'm just sitting here.

260
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Isn't it so happy?

261
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
When the mountain wind doesn't stop,

262
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
when the river water stops flowing.

263
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
When time stops,

264
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
and the day and night are not separated.

265
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
When everything in the world is for nothing.

266
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I still can't break up with you.

267
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I still can't break up with you.

268
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Your tenderness

269
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
is the greatest protection in my life.

270
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,000
When the sun no longer rises,

271
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
when the earth no longer rotates.

272
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
When the spring, summer, and autumn are no longer changing.

273
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
When all the flowers and plants are withered.

274
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I still can't break up with you.

275
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I still can't break up with you.

276
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Your smile

277
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
is the greatest protection in my life.

278
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
When the city is full of life,

279
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
we live in a happy life.

280
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
We ride the horse and sing together,

281
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and we know the past.

282
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
We drink and sing,

283
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
and we walk together.

284
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
We are young and bright.

285
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
When the city is full of life,

286
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
we live in a happy life.

287
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
We ride the horse and sing together,

288
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
and we know the past.

289
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
We drink and sing,

290
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
and we walk together.

291
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
We are young and bright.

292
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
We are young and bright.

293
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
When the sun no longer rises,

294
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
when the earth no longer rotates.

295
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
When the spring, summer, and autumn are no longer changing.
