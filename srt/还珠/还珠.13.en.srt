4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Why is it fighting?

5
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I don't know.

6
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But...

7
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
This is a good chance for the 5th Prince to show off his charm to Xiao Yan Zi.

8
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
5th Prince!

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Show us your skills! We're all watching!

10
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Jing Yuan! Jing Yuan!

11
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You've been practicing martial arts since you were little. Don't let us down!

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
5th Prince!

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Come on! Come on!

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Jing Yuan! Jing Yuan!

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Jing Yuan!

16
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is a good move.

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Zi Wei, which one do you think they're fighting? Xiao Yan Zi?

18
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Xiao Yan Zi has been restless since early morning. I'm not sure either.

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
These kids are always making trouble.

20
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
They're really not like Zi Wei.

21
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Young people should be wild.

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Let them compete with each other. It's not good to be in a fight.

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes.

24
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Miss Zi Wei, help the old master prepare the cultural relics.

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes, old master.

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Good.

27
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
You have a gift for each other?

28
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Here, I'll go get some more grass.

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Okay.

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You've been so close.

31
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
5th Prince, help me get it.

32
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
5th Prince!

33
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
This is a competition, not a dance!

34
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
So it's him you want?

35
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
What are they talking about?

36
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
So it's him you want?

37
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
What are they talking about?

38
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
They're talking about...

39
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't know.

40
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I don't know.

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I don't know.

42
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
What are they talking about?

43
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
They're talking about...

44
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't know.

45
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Boring. Let's go.

46
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Xiao Yan Zi, wait for me!

47
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Although Xiao Yan Zi isn't Yong Qi's sister,

48
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
they're so different.

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
How could Yong Qi like her?

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Love is...

51
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
It's really hard to understand.

52
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Xiao Yan Zi, wait for me.

53
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll go get the grass.

54
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes.

55
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'll be right back.

56
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Okay.

57
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The family is so close.

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Xiao Yan Zi!

59
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Come and see!

60
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If I knew they were so close,

61
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I wouldn't have met them.

62
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The difficulty of life is in love.

63
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What?

64
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
You regret meeting me?

65
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
How could you say that?

66
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm talking about them.

67
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm not a puppy.

68
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
If I can't get her,

69
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I can't get the relationship between Xiao Yan Zi and the Fifth Prince.

70
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Lord Jing,

71
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
you're obviously not related to Xiao Yan Zi.

72
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Why are you upset with the Fifth Prince?

73
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
You really think you can get along with the Fifth Prince?

74
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This...

75
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I was afraid that the fire would burn.

76
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So I kept it for the Fifth Prince.

77
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You can even doubt that?

78
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Lord Jing,

79
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
you're too petty.

80
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Then you...

81
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
If you're right,

82
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
why should I be petty?

83
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Okay, okay, okay.

84
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You've made up a line with me several times.

85
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Now you want me to do it?

86
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Fine.

87
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I...

88
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
won't be angry with you.

89
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You're just a prince.

90
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I, Xiao Yan Zi, have never been so mean.

91
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm not a bad girl.

92
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I, a prince,

93
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
have never been so low-key to talk to a girl.

94
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Watch out!

95
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Jing Yuan!

96
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
The sky is clear

97
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The world is different

98
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
This time you say

99
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I've been

100
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The color of the flowers is different

101
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
The flowers are?

102
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
The flowers are red

103
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The fire is burning

104
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
The fire is burning

105
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
The fire is burning

106
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
The fire is burning

107
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The fire is burning

108
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
The fire is burning

109
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The fire is burning

110
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The fire is burning

111
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
The fire is burning

112
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
The fire is burning

113
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
The fire is burning

114
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
The fire is burning

115
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
The fire is burning

116
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The fire is burning

117
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
The fire is burning

118
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I cooked you some wine

119
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and drank some cold water.

120
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Drink it.

121
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Hurry up and drink it.

122
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
It's only good if you drink it while it's hot.

123
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
You sound experienced.

124
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
When I was filming,

125
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
the rain and water were common.

126
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
If I got sick and missed the work,

127
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
the whole team would be waiting for me.

128
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
But, Mr. Jin,

129
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
you're good at writing and dancing.

130
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Why can't you swim?

131
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
When I was in the Royal Garden,

132
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I was thrown into the water and almost drowned.

133
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
How could he have the right to be drowned?

134
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
He's a bad guy.

135
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'll kill you.

136
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I'll kill you.

137
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I'll kill you.

138
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The queen has turned into a dog and left.

139
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Don't be afraid of water.

140
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I mentioned your past.

142
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The queen must have punished them severely.

143
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The ones who can enter the Royal Garden are the nobles.

144
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Although my family is from Ula-Nara,

145
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm a bastard.

146
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So, for the rest of my life,

147
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I'll do my best

148
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
to not let the queen down.

149
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Just do it.

150
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I didn't expect

151
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
that my casual words

152
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
would make his life so harsh.

153
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Mr. Jin, I'll toast you.

154
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Cheers.

155
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Cheers.

156
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I've missed you.

157
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Let's drink and have a good time.

158
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'll play the most romantic movie for you.

159
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'll play it in my memory.

160
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You're the one who hit me.

161
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
My life is destined.

162
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
The time you gave me is not enough.

163
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I'm the one who told you.

164
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Let the longing become a river.

165
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
The night sky is so beautiful.

166
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'll wait for you to see the beautiful scenery.

167
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The flowers are so beautiful.

168
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The moon is so beautiful.

169
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The moon is so beautiful.

170
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The moon is so beautiful.

171
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
The moon is so beautiful.

172
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The moon is so beautiful.

173
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The moon is so beautiful.

174
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Love is enough.

175
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
After the end,

176
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
we'll go back to our own time and space.

177
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
This time, you said

178
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
you missed me.
