1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Long Ballad

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Long Ballad

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Love once and it's enough

5
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
At this moment, our distance is so close

6
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Seeing me seems to be able to see the ice melting in his eyes

7
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I believe I can change his future

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Because this is my world

9
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I am not the same as him

10
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I don't know how long I can watch his time

11
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
It seems that Li Er is still very proud

12
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
She actually invited Jing Yuan to the study

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So beautiful

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
So beautiful

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
No

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is boring

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Is there a bigger one?

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Brother, brother

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
This is a palace after all

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's not good to get into someone else's

21
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's okay

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I brought these fireworks

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I will take care of everything that happens today

24
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Brother

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
So good

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
When the wind does not leave

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
When the water does not flow

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The fireworks are so big

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's not as good as the one in front of you

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So beautiful

31
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This fireworks is too beautiful

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Yongqi as a prince

33
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Always be remembered by the emperor

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Erkang, Keqi, Fuli

35
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
They are from the Ming family

36
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
They can let go of the world

37
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
A quick life

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Should I live in the moment?

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Let myself be impudent

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
The queen is here

41
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Greetings to the queen

42
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What are you doing?

43
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
This is the palace, not the grand courtyard

44
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Xiao Yanzi, you are always spoiled

45
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
No rules, no etiquette

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
But don't forget

47
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I will decide in the harem

48
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I

49
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Why are you here?

50
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Queen

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You are as rude as Xiao Yanzi

53
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Disloyal, heartless

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You brought my child back

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The new queen is still not up

56
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You are still not up

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Disloyal, heartless

58
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Lin'er, wake up

60
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Lin'er

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Queen

62
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Queen, please spare my life

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Say

64
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Did this heartless let you go to the study?

65
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Queen

66
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
This has nothing to do with Lin'er

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I came here by myself

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You came here by yourself

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Is this the place you should come?

70
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Queen

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Why don't you let Lord Jing come to the study?

72
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Do you know

73
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Lord Jing is in the study

74
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
It's a happy effect

75
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The study is a place to bring happiness

76
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Unlike some places

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's not like some places

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's creepy

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
It's not like some people

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Weird

81
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You

82
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Xiao Yanzi

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
You can't be rude in front of the queen

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
What do you mean by creepy?

85
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Who is weird?

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Me?

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Queen

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Xiao Yanzi came to the palace to welcome Ziwei today

89
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Everyone is a little drunk

90
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Xiao Yanzi, Lin'er, sorry to offend you

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm sorry

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Please give me a mask

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I will definitely open Xiao Yanzi in the future

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Please open Xiao Yanzi

95
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
The study has the privilege given by the emperor

96
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
And the support of the fifth prince

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
It's a precious place that no one can touch

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I always have to give the fifth prince face

99
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Thank you, queen

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I won't argue with him now

101
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But I'm a maid in Kunning Palace

102
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I can take it back to discipline

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'm going to the dark room

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Oh, no

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I'm going to the dark room

106
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
What are you doing?

107
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
You're awake

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
You're full

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Now you can talk

110
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Say

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
What is Ziwei?

112
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Is it a person from the other side?

113
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
What?

114
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
You're full and you're mute

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Okay

116
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I'll open the umbrella for you

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
No, no

118
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
This bitch

119
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
She's not honest even if she comes here

120
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Oh, my God

121
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
What should I do?

122
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
If you really want to kill me

123
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm afraid

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
If you really want to kill me

125
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Say it

126
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Say it or not

127
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
It's all my fault

128
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
It has nothing to do with others

129
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Please punish me

130
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
You've been practicing martial arts for five years

131
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You've never made any mistakes in the past 20 years

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
But now

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
You're doing this for a low-ranked maid

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It's all my fault

135
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm sorry

136
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
You're doing this for a low-ranked maid

137
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You're doing this for a low-ranked maid

138
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm going to beg father

139
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Xiao Yanzi

140
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Father is busy

141
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You can't disturb the Sheng family for this

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm afraid if I don't go

143
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
That nanny Rong will torture me to death

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I don't care

145
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'm going to beg father

146
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Xiao Yanzi

147
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
You're looking for the emperor to sue the queen

148
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You're so unreasonable

149
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
We have insufficient etiquette

150
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
It's just a love affair

151
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
How can you ask the emperor to help you?

152
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I can help you

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't worry

154
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Jingyan is here

155
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I believe he cares more about Li'er than anyone else

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
So let's take a break

157
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Ertai and I will go and check on the situation

158
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Ok

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Still not telling the truth

160
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,000
It seems that this Xizhen is just a brain for you

161
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I can't clear your head

162
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Come on

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Let's do it

164
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
This needle is for seducing and seducing

165
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
This needle is for hitting the queen

166
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Come on

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I'll kill you

168
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Come on

169
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I'll kill you

170
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
I was afraid that day

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
He was with you in the deep night

172
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I was so worried

173
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I thought you would have a sense of propriety

174
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I didn't expect you to be so stubborn

175
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
You let me down

176
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I know I was wrong about the teaching of the nanny

177
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I will definitely be with Ling'er in the future

178
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
That girl is suspicious of the relationship with Xiao Yanzi

179
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
She has a bad intention for you

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Her identity is low-key, ferocious and unruly

181
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
She is unruly and unruly

182
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Your mother is in heaven

183
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't want to see you being misled by her

184
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
I know I was wrong

185
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I will be strict with myself

186
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But please

187
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Forgive her

188
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Light up the legend of the fire

189
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The flying fish and the devil

190
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
You and me

191
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Smile and tear

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:14,000
How many lives can be written for the old song

193
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Forget it

194
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Since I know my mistake

195
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
I will spare her this time

196
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
But I can't escape from the crime

197
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Just take it as a punishment for you

198
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Go

199
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Thank you, your highness

200
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I didn't

201
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I didn't eat the pear

202
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I was just possessed by the ghost

203
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
I didn't mean what I said

204
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Don't you know, nanny?

205
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I want to see how many sisters and brides are hidden in your body

206
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Can you hold me?

207
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
No

208
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Mother

209
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,240
I don't have the ghost-resurrecting

210
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Please spare me

211
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Mother

212
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Spare you?

213
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Fine

214
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's not up to me

215
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
It's up to you

216
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
What's the origin of Ziwei?

217
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Say it

218
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
If I say it, what should Ziwei do?

219
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Still don't say it?

220
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Let me go

221
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
In front of your eyes

222
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Stars and rivers are full of hope

223
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
The most brilliant but the most dry

224
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Flowing to the end of the world

225
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Filled with the fire of the world

226
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Walk past the scattered clouds

227
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Let me go

228
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Xitong, you're so despicable

229
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Don't you have any other way?

230
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Let's walk hand in hand

231
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't want to

232
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The mission is about to fail

233
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
The world of the drawing book is about to be destroyed

234
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
The mission is about to fail

235
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The mission is about to fail

236
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
The mission is about to fail

237
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The mission is about to fail

238
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
The mission is about to fail

239
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The mission is about to fail

240
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
The mission is about to fail

241
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
The mission is about to fail

242
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The mission is about to fail

243
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
The mission is about to fail

244
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The mission is about to fail

245
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The mission is about to fail

246
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
The mission is about to fail

247
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The mission is about to fail

248
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
The mission is about to fail

249
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The mission is about to fail

250
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
The mission is about to fail

251
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The mission is about to fail

252
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The mission is about to fail

253
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The mission is about to fail

254
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The mission is about to fail

255
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
The mission is about to fail

256
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
The mission is about to fail

257
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The mission is about to fail

258
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,000
The mission is about to fail

259
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The mission is about to fail

260
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The mission is about to fail

261
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The mission is about to fail

262
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
You're the reason I'm here

263
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'm destined to be here

264
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
The time you gave me

265
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Is not enough to tell you

266
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
It's all me

267
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Let the longing become a river

268
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The smoke of the night

269
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
The wind blows

270
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The day is so bright

271
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
The flowers are all red

272
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Let the desert

273
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Be filled with the warmth of the people

274
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
The people are all red

275
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
The people are all red

276
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
The people are all red

277
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
The people are all red

278
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The people are all red

279
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Love once is enough

280
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
In the future

281
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
We will go back to our own time

282
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:47,000
This time you said you missed it
