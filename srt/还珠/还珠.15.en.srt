6
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Xiao Yanzi, look what I bought for you.

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Yongqi, you can't leave Xiao Yanzi for a moment.

8
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Lian'er, what's wrong?

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You have something on your mind?

10
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
It's nice. This is good.

11
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let's buy the horn.

12
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Boss, how much is this?

13
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Is our journey about to end?

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
According to the plan, we should go back to Beijing the day after tomorrow.

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The day after tomorrow?

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes.

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
According to the plot, His Majesty will be assassinated soon.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Ziwei is in charge.

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
How can I bear to watch Ziwei get hurt?

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Lian'er, why would Ziwei get hurt?

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I have to think of a way to put an end to this big thing and a small thing.

22
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
In order to avoid serious injury.

23
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Serious injury?

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Do you have gold?

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Gold? Yes.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Is it not good?

27
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
This is a gold leaf.

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is my gold jade pendant.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
This is a silver ticket.

30
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
This time, when we get back to the capital, I will give you all my money.

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You can buy whatever you want.

32
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
What do you want?

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I didn't expect that the minister of the Heart and Soul temple is so nice to his wife.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
If the people in the palace know about this, they will be shocked.

35
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Of course.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
From now on, my whole life,

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
it's a pity that it will be yours.

38
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,200
ar

39
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Miss, the gold-embellished item you want is ready.

40
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Do you think it's satisfied?

41
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,920
I'm satisfied.

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,200
With this big golden lock,

43
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,760
Ziwei can eat less grapes when he's in danger.

44
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,360
Besides, this is a golden lock.

45
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,600
I've made up for the missing role

46
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,840
in this story.

47
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,000
This is for Ziwei.

48
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,000
For me?

49
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,440
Such a big golden lock!

50
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
No, Ling'er.

51
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,120
It's too precious.

52
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,120
I can't accept it.

53
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,160
It's not that precious.

54
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,360
Here, Ziwei.

55
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,360
Put it on.

56
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,760
You gave him all your money?

57
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,840
It looks good.

58
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,760
He gave such a big lock to someone else?

59
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,400
Isn't he doing this for Ziwei?

60
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,840
It proves that he's not a greedy person.

61
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,880
Besides, this is Ling'er's love.

62
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,880
What if I help him?

63
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,240
Okay.

64
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:38,760
Here.

65
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,560
Ziwei, I've made up my mind.

66
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,000
You're in need of money.

67
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,760
You can keep him safe.

68
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,880
Promise me.

69
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,480
Don't take it off.

70
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,280
Thank you, Ling'er.

71
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,400
Let's eat.

72
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,840
Here.

73
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,080
Ziwei, this is pork liver.

74
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,400
It's good for your blood circulation.

75
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,440
Eat more.

76
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,280
Okay.

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,560
I don't need to take blood.

78
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,520
You've had enough blood.

79
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,320
You don't need to take it.

80
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:15,840
Here.

81
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,760
Ling'er, you're biased.

82
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Thank you, Ling'er.

83
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,520
Ziwei is weak.

84
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,200
Here.

85
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,440
Huo Jie, what are you doing outside?

86
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,120
It's so crowded.

87
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,120
There's a group of people outside.

88
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,200
Your father and father-in-law went to see it.

89
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:32,960
Group?

90
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,520
I'll go and see it.

91
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,160
Xiao Yanzi, I haven't finished eating.

92
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,560
Xiao Yanzi, wait for me.

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,960
Don't get lost again.

94
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,560
Ziwei, let's go and see it.

95
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,200
Okay.

96
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,280
Ling'er, I'll eat when I come back.

97
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:44,480
Let's go.

98
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,280
Let's play.

99
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:47,880
Oh, no.

100
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,400
I remember the assassin who assassinated His Majesty

101
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,800
disguised as a playboy.

102
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,640
Xiao Yanzi.

103
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,760
Die!

104
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:10,640
Ren��.

105
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,760
line up

106
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,360
Run.

107
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,160
Ling'er, be careful.

108
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,460
Be careful.

109
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Ziwei, be careful!

110
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,880
Ziwei, be careful!

111
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,360
Ziwei, help!

112
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,120
Ziwei!

113
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,440
Ziwei!

114
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:05,920
Ziwei!

115
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,440
Ziwei!

116
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,040
Ziwei!

117
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:07,880
Hurry up and save him!

118
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,680
Ziwei!

119
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,160
Qingyuan, be careful!

120
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,320
Be careful!

121
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,960
Also the sino resistent one,

122
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,120
Qingyuan,

123
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,320
Dong Technique dog,

124
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,760
is not guilty soChristina long Labour

125
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,560
Qingyun.

126
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,360
Qingyun.

127
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,360
Qingyun.

128
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,760
Qingyun.

129
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,560
Who dares to fall into the world

130
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,960
Can burn the fireworks in the world

131
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,360
Walk past the scattered leaves

132
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,360
Don't cry.

133
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,560
Never let go

134
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,160
Don't cry.

135
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,360
Let's hold hands and smile

136
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,560
In the world of red, the years are short

137
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,360
Come on.

138
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,360
Come on. Master Jin is hurt.

139
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,760
Come on.

140
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
Help.

141
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,360
Help.

142
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,760
How is it?

143
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,760
How is it?

144
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,360
Lord Fu, Fifth Prince.

145
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,760
Fortunately, the gold lock was blocked.

146
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,360
Miss Ziwei's injury is not too serious.

147
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,160
She is safe.

148
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,160
Come on.

149
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:40,960
Miss Ling'er.

150
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,960
It's hard to forget the life-saving grace.

151
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:55,760
How is it?

152
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,760
How is she?

153
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,160
Lord Jing's knife wound is in a hurry.

154
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,160
The knife is broken.

155
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,160
The situation is critical.

156
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,160
If she is unconscious all the time,

157
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,560
I'm afraid it's too dangerous.

158
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,760
Come on.

159
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Jingyuan.

160
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,960
Jingyuan.

161
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,360
Jingyuan, wake up.

162
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,560
Wake up.

163
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,960
Wake up, okay?

164
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,760
Wake up.

165
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,960
Jingyuan.

166
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,160
Sorry.

167
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,560
It's all my fault.

168
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,160
Sorry.

169
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:55,960
Ling'er.

170
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,760
Jingyuan.

171
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,360
Jingyuan is in such a state now.

172
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,960
Ling'er must be in a bad mood.

173
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,760
Let her stay alone for a while.

174
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,460
An'er.

175
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,460
No.

176
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,780
Since he is my master,

177
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,540
I don't want him to die.

178
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,540
I don't want him to die.

179
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,540
I don't want him to die.

180
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:26,540
I don't want him to die.

181
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:28,540
I don't want him to die.

182
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,540
I don't want him to die.

183
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,980
You can only go back after he dies.

184
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,460
What?

185
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,460
What did you say?

186
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:50,460
He was a character you added to your list.

187
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,460
He was not part of the Pearl World.

188
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,460
The characters will be gone

189
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,460
and they will be returned to their respective places.

190
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,460
No wonder I can't talk to him.

191
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:09,460
So his fate can only be lost?

192
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,460
No.

193
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,460
No.

194
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,460
No.

195
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,460
I don't accept it.

196
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,460
I don't accept it.

197
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,460
No.

198
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:08,460
Who misses the moonlight

199
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,460
and misses the past

200
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:14,460
with a good heart

201
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,460
and a smile

202
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:22,460
Youthful and happy

203
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:25,460
in the white road

204
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,460
There is always a round of shadow

205
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:30,460
in the autumn

206
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:33,460
The moon is shining

207
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,460
and the frost is falling

208
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:39,460
The missing that has fallen

209
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:42,460
is about to bloom

210
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,460
I'll take time away

211
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:48,460
I tried my best to get the plot back to the original

212
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,460
I just want to let myself live

213
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,460
I never thought that I would decide your fate

214
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:57,460
with a word

215
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,460
At first, I just wanted to use you

216
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,460
I never thought I would hurt you like this

217
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,460
I'm sorry, Qingyuan

218
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:11,460
Is it right to respect the plot from the beginning?

219
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,460
Love once is enough

220
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,460
The future is different

221
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,460
The future is different

222
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,460
This time you said

223
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,460
that you will miss me

224
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,460
The color of the candlelight is not moving

225
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,460
The flower of the butterfly is not moving

226
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,460
The flower of the blood is not moving

227
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,460
The burning hot fire is not going to be reaped

228
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,460
The softness of the ice is strong

229
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,460
The heart is burning

230
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,460
The heart is burning

231
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,460
The love is unbreakable

232
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:43,460
The secret of the sky is tender

233
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,460
It's like a dagger

234
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,460
Always be my love

235
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:50,460
I can't hide your clue

236
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,460
Always be my love

237
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,460
I can't hold on to it anymore

238
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,460
If love is enough

239
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,460
If you miss it, then let it go

240
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,460
I will play the most romantic movie for you

241
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,460
in the memory

242
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,460
You are the one who hit me on the head

243
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,460
My life is destined

244
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,460
The time you left for me

245
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,460
is not enough to tell you that it's me

246
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,460
Let the longing become a river

247
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,460
The color of the candlelight is not moving

248
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,460
The flower of the butterfly is not moving

249
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,460
The flower of the blood is not moving

250
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,460
The flower of the blood is not moving

251
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,460
The burning hot fire is not moving

252
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,460
The burning hot fire is not going to be reaped

253
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:29,460
The softness of the ice is strong

254
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,460
The heart is burning

255
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,460
The heart is burning

256
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,460
The love is unbreakable

257
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,460
If love is enough

258
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,460
If you miss it, then let it go

259
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,460
I will play the most romantic movie for you

260
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,460
in the memory

261
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,460
You are the one who hit me on the head

262
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,460
My life is destined

263
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,460
The time you left for me

264
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:52,460
is not enough to tell you that it's me
