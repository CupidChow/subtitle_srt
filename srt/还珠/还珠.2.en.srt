00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The Long Ballad

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Long Ballad

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The Long Ballad

5
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm sorry for my rudeness.

7
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

8
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Please kneel.

9
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

10
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
How's the progress of the case?

11
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The mastermind has been investigated.

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's time to change the head of the Bureau, Song Meng.

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Bring her here.

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
She is the maid who bought the fake identity.

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I don't know what this identity used to do.

16
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I have to think of a reasonable explanation.

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Otherwise, I will die.

18
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I will die.

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Your Highness.

20
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I said it.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I said everything.

22
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I came to the palace...

23
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
actually...

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
actually for...

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
I can only rely on you.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Officer Jing.

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Officer Jing?

28
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How could it be Officer Jing?

29
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
How dare you speak nonsense in front of Her Highness?

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
How dare you speak nonsense?

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You are my life-saving prop.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Right now,

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
my hands hurt.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
My heart...

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
hurts even more.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
When we first met,

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
we fell in love at first sight.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I thought you were just a commoner's son.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
But I didn't expect that...

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
our identities are so unreachable.

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
But true love...

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
is not about the feeling of love.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
What is love in this world?

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's the love that...

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
we give each other in our life.

47
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Officer Jing.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I tried my best to get to the bottom of this.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I just want to ask you a question.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Right now,

51
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
there is only one thing left.

52
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It's him.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You should be like the Pan family.

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I should be like the Pu family.

55
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The Pu family is like a thread.

56
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The Pan family...

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
is like a thread.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Let go of me.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Jing Yue.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
If you really have something to do with this woman...

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I have nothing to do with her.

62
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Your Highness.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Your Highness, please don't make things difficult for Officer Jing.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
It's all my fault.

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm just afraid...

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
that after I die,

67
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
the palace will be in a state of shock.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm afraid...

69
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
that they will say that Officer Jing...

70
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
is a coward,

71
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
that he is a man of no value,

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
that he kills people,

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
that he eats people,

74
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
that he is a man of no value.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I thought of this.

76
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I was so heartbroken.

77
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm so shocked.

78
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I should be fine now.

79
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
It's not difficult.

80
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You are so obsessed with her.

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You can't bear to drag Officer Jing into this.

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Fine.

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I'll help you.

84
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I've passed the test.

85
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
You've improved.

86
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
What?

87
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
No.

88
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's unreasonable.

89
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
What should I do?

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Who can save me?

91
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Pearl Princess.

92
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Wait.

93
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Your Highness.

94
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'm a member of Pearl Princess.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What are you talking about?

96
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
When did there ever be a Pearl Princess in the palace?

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
There was no Pearl Princess.

98
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
In Pearl Princess's world,

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
how could there be no Pearl Princess?

100
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Did I kill her?

101
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Xiao Yanzi, where are you?

102
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Your Highness.

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
This case is well done.

104
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Get the matter of the gold back to the emperor.

105
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
He is in a hurry to be prepared.

106
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Yes.

107
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
He is in a hurry to be prepared.

108
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
No wonder Xiao Yanzi hasn't entered the palace yet.

109
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Your Highness.

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Pearl Princess is the illegitimate daughter of the emperor.

111
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
On the day of the hunt, she will be the father.

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Then she will enter the palace.

113
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
She will be the new wife of the empress.

114
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The devil's eyes are on fire.

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Take her away.

116
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
What I said is true.

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Wait.

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I'm not going to believe what I said.

119
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
On the day of the hunt, we'll share it.

120
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
The empress is suspicious.

121
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I said the new wife is in a big trouble.

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
She will kill me.

123
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Xiao Yanzi.

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You are in a big trouble.

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm sorry.

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Where are we going?

127
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Shenqing Temple.

128
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
No.

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The empress has forgiven me.

130
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What else do you want?

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I warn you.

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
In the palace...

133
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
How dare you run away?

134
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'm too weak.

135
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Please forgive me.

136
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
This little maid is clumsy.

137
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
She broke something.

138
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm teaching her.

139
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Just this little word?

140
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Yes.

141
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Go.

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm scared.

143
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Go.

144
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Isn't it just a broken thing?

145
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Do you have to hit me?

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
You bitch.

147
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Today I'll teach you a lesson.

148
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
If you hit the prince,

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
you'll have ten heads.

150
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's not enough.

151
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You're wrong.

152
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Do as the rules.

153
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Yes.

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
You'll be killed by the hunter.

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Ten times more.

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
No.

157
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
She will die.

158
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You low-class maids.

159
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
When you come into the palace,

160
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
you have to know your fate.

161
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Stop.

162
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Ten times more.

163
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Lord Jing.

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's only three...

165
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Yes.

166
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You want to save her.

167
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Why did you let her suffer for nothing?

168
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
In this palace,

169
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
the rules are the rules.

170
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
If you make a mistake, you'll be punished.

171
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Rules?

172
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Can rules be bigger than human lives?

173
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
How can you be so cold-blooded?

174
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Did you see the steel from afar?

175
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Last year, a man promised to help the maid.

176
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
But they both died.

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The palace has a life.

178
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Keep your mouth shut.

179
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But...

180
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I have to keep my mouth shut.

181
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Only six princes left.

182
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Once the prince is dead,

183
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
the character will die.

184
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
No.

185
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
How many more princes?

186
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Why don't you have numbers?

187
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
What numbers?

188
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

189
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Seven, six, five, four, three, two, one.

190
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
The numbers haven't changed.

191
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
So I'm not short of numbers when I talk to him.

192
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
He must be my official CP.

193
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Go.

194
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
My lord.

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
You and Miss Lin are talking in secret.

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'll open the door for you.

197
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
It's all your fault for talking nonsense

198
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
and ruining my reputation.

199
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Ruin?

200
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You mean...

201
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
You're Tong Zishan?

202
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Are you in love with her or are you two sisters?

203
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I like her.

204
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Shut up.

205
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Let's talk.

206
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Don't be so mean.

207
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'm a night-watching fairy.

208
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
We're a couple.

209
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
We can't be separated.

210
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
If you don't believe me,

211
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I can prove it to you.

212
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
How?

213
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Do you remember my prophecy?

214
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
On the day of hunting,

215
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Princess Pearl will be pregnant.

216
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
If this really happens,

217
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
it's the best proof.

218
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What's your conspiracy?

219
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Your props are so heavy.

220
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
So scary.

221
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
So creepy.

222
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
It's true.

223
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
The criminal department is the criminal department.

224
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Look at these props.

225
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The criminal department is the key.

226
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Don't die early.

227
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Say it.

228
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I...

229
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I just want to make a bet with you.

230
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
What do you want to bet with me?

231
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Be bold.

232
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I bet this.

233
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
If Princess Pearl really appears,

234
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
even if I win,

235
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
the jade pendant belongs to me.

236
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
If you lose,

237
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I'll make you die.

238
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Deal.

239
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Deal.

240
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
My man,

241
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Nan Nian.

242
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Where is Xiao Yan Zi?

243
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Such a big field.

244
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Jiu Yan,

245
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
help me keep an eye on this Lin girl.

246
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
If there's any movement,

247
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
you help me solve it.

248
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I told you to smoke incense and smoke insects.

249
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
But you

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
have been smoking in the field for a long time.

251
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Jing Yan,

252
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
thank you for your job today.

253
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Prince Wu,

254
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Lord Fu,

255
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Jing Yan,

256
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
we grew up together.

257
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You always ignored all the famous girls.

258
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
But today you bring a maid to the field.

259
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Er Kang,

260
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Er Kang and I are very curious.

261
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
It's just a work.

262
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Nothing else.

263
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
How dare you steal?

264
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Do your job well.

265
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
And you...

266
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
You're so cruel.

267
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm just a maid.

268
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I don't know the rules.

269
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
If you steal again,

270
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I'll throw you into the woods to feed the wolves.

271
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Do your job well.

272
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I have to find a way to escape.

273
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Otherwise, I can't catch up with the key plot.

274
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Why are you still standing there?

275
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Do your job.

276
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Er Kang said

277
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
you were cruel

278
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
and heartless to us.

279
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You took away the best bow in the field

280
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
and stole two maids.

281
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Why didn't I see it?

282
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
It seems that I

283
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
can only use you.

284
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
How dare you steal again?

285
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
It hurts.

286
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It hurts.

287
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
This is...

288
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
This is Lord Jing's jade pendant.

289
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
He never leaves his body.

290
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Could it be that

291
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Lord Jing and you

292
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
are telling the truth?

293
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
What do you think?

294
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Miss Lian Er, you must be tired.

295
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Come on.

296
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Go to the sound system and take a rest.

297
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
I'll do this.

298
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Miss Lian Er, slow down.

299
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Be careful of your feet.

300
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Brother Huan Zhu, I'm back.

301
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm back.

302
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Miss Lian Er,

303
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm back.

304
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'm back.

305
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
I'm back.

306
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'm back.

307
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I'm back.

308
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'm back.

309
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
I'm back.

310
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm back.

311
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
I'm back.

312
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
I'm back.

313
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I'm back.

314
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm back.

315
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'm back.

316
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm back.

317
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm back.

318
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
I'm back.

319
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm back.

320
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm back.

321
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm back.

322
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm back.

323
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I'm back.

324
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
I'm back.

325
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I'm back.

326
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
I'm back.

327
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
I'm back.

328
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm back.

329
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm back.

330
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I'm back.
