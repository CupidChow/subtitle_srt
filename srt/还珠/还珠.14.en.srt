7
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
What kind of person are you?

8
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You are so strange.

9
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
You are so untrue.

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
But I am true.

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Can you believe me?

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Lord Jin.

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
You saved my life.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Why should I believe you?

15
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I came back from a future more than 200 years later.

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I came here at first.

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I was thinking how to go back.

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
So...

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
So I often used you.

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
What a future more than 200 years later.

21
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Because of him,

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I was born such a obsessed Lin Sui Sui.

23
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You...

24
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Jin Yuan.

25
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You are a cheater.

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But you make me feel sad.

27
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
And make me feel sad.

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I can't bear to leave him.

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I can't bear to leave him.

30
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I can't bear to leave here.

31
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I can't bear to leave you.

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Love once is enough.

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
The end.

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Back to our own time.

35
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,000
This time you said you missed me.

36
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The color of the night is not moving.

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
The flowers will fade away.

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
The flowers are red.

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The fireflies are burning.

40
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The fireflies are burning.

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The wind is blowing.

42
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You think you can't hold it back.

43
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Always be my love.

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I can't hide your clues.

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Always be my love.

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I can't hold it back.

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Love once is enough.

48
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Back to our own time.

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
This time you said you missed me.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We won't go back.

51
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The time is passing by.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The sun is setting.

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The heart is quietly approaching.

54
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Love once is enough.

55
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Missing you.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I don't want to be the most romantic movie.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I will make you feel lonely.

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The unexpected pressure is not destined.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
The time you gave me.

60
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm the one who is not enough for you.

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Let the four days become a river.

62
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Always be my love.

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Jingyuan, why is your neck always crooked?

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I...

65
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I was a little out of shape last night.

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Oh, I see.

67
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Why did the peacock keep calling this morning?

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
It turns out that someone used his neck to draw a bridge.

69
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Lei Er.

70
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
What's wrong?

71
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Why are you so weird?

72
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What are you laughing at?

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Do I look like someone?

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You do.

75
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Sugar gourd.

76
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Do you want to eat sugar gourd?

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Sugar gourd.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Do you want to eat it?

79
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Do you want to eat it, Xiao Yan Zi?

80
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Do you want to eat sugar gourd?

81
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'll buy it now.

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Jingyuan, this sugar gourd comes from our capital.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Why did you come to Yangzhou?

84
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
The capital has the taste of the capital.

85
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And Yangzhou has the taste of Yangzhou.

86
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
If you're in a different mood, the taste will be different.

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Oh.

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You have to try it.

89
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
You have to try it.

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Wait for me.

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Drunkenness is not wine.

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
What kind of wine are you talking about?

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Is it good?

94
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
This sugar gourd is pretty good.

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You don't want to eat it?

96
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I left you the biggest one.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'll see you at night.

98
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Xiao Yan Zi, let's go.

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Zi Wei is in front of us.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll be right there.

101
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
The sugar gourd hasn't been eaten yet.

102
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Why are you smiling so sweetly?

103
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm happy to see it sweet.

104
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Jingyuan.

105
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Jingyuan.

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
You can't sleep either?

107
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Your Majesty.

108
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Greetings to Your Majesty.

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Look.

110
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
The night is so beautiful.

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I want to sing a poem.

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Where is the moon?

113
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
The mountain villa is drunk.

114
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Hmm.

115
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's cool in the summer.

116
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
The water is clear.

117
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
How is it?

118
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Good.

119
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Your Majesty, you are a master of poetry.

120
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Tonight, I'm going to sing another poem.

121
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm honored to be able to enjoy the moon with Your Majesty.

122
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm lucky.

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's late at night.

124
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Please take care of yourself.

125
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
You should go to bed early.

126
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Where is the moon at night?

127
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Where is the white bamboo?

128
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
The moon is bright.

129
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
But there are few people.

130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
If there are no two people, it's also.

131
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But I think

132
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
the Su University should be less of a kind of idle person.

133
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Please explain, Your Majesty.

134
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
A idle person who is over the wall.

135
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Your Majesty.

136
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Get up quickly.

137
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Don't spoil this great emotion.

138
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Go to work.

139
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Yes.

140
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Hey.

141
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Where are you going?

142
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You little kid.

143
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Why are you still standing there?

144
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Didn't you just say that it's already late?

145
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm tired.

146
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

147
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Sui Sui.

148
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Sui Sui.

149
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I'm late.

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
She won't be angry, right?

151
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
How am I going to tell her about this?

152
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Let's go.

153
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Surprise.

154
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
What's this?

155
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I was thinking

156
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
someone must have never seen so many fireflies in the sky.

157
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
I have a surprise for you.

158
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Great.

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Who knew that the person who made the firefly

160
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
would be so late.

161
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I was bitten by a lot of fireflies.

162
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Let me see.

163
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Actually, I should have arrived earlier.

164
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I just happened to meet His Majesty.

165
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I was just listening to him talk.

166
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
So I was a little bit embarrassed.

167
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
So you really like to talk.

168
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I thought it was just a story.

169
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
His Majesty is busy with state affairs.

170
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
He is busy with work.

171
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
It's rare to have a time to relax.

172
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
As a subject,

173
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
it's my honor to be with him at this moment.

174
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
When you mentioned His Majesty,

175
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
you were so surprised.

176
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Lord Jing,

177
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
you really admire him, right?

178
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Sui Sui.

179
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
After I come back to the capital,

180
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I plan to ask His Majesty to grant me a marriage.

181
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
With His Majesty's permission,

182
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm sure Her Highness won't object.

183
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
The two of us...

184
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Even if Her Highness doesn't object,

185
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
the road ahead

186
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
will be very difficult.

187
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Difficult?

188
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
After we two met,

189
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
everything is difficult.

190
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
But we both did it.

191
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
But in my opinion,

192
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
there is one thing you haven't done yet.

193
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Don't worry.

194
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
After we get married,

195
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I'll go back to your hometown with you.

196
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Beijing, Chaoyang District.

197
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll remember it.

198
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
If the plot continues to develop so smoothly,

199
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
will I finally return to the real world?

200
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
What should I do?

201
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'll go back to the capital.

202
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'll go back to the capital.

203
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I'll go back to the capital.

204
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'll go back to the capital.

205
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'll go back to the capital.

206
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I'll go back to the capital.

207
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'll go back to the capital.

208
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I'll go back to the capital.

209
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I'll go back to the capital.

210
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I'll go back to the capital.

211
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
I'll go back to the capital.

212
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
I'll go back to the capital.

213
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'll go back to the capital.

214
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'll go back to the capital.

215
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I'll go back to the capital.

216
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The color of the flowers is unchanging.

217
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The flowers will fade away.

218
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
The flowers will fade away.

219
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The flowers will fade away.

220
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
The flowers will fade away.

221
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
The flowers will fade away.

222
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The flowers will fade away.

223
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
The flowers will fade away.

224
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
The flowers will fade away.

225
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
The flowers will fade away.

226
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
The flowers will fade away.

227
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The flowers will fade away.

228
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
If love is enough.

229
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
If love is enough.

230
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Then let's just say it.

231
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I'll play the most romantic movie for you.

232
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
In my memory.

233
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
You're my big brother.

234
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You're my destiny.

235
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The time you give me is not enough.

236
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I'll tell you everything.

237
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Let the yearning become a river.

238
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The color of the flowers is unchanging.

239
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
The flowers will fade away.

240
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
The flowers will fade away.

241
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The flowers will fade away.

242
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
The flowers will fade away.

243
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
The flowers will fade away.

244
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
If love is enough.

245
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Then let's just say it.

246
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'll play the most romantic movie for you.

247
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
In my memory.

248
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
You're my big brother.

249
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
You're my destiny.

250
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The time you give me is not enough.

251
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'll play the most romantic movie for you.

252
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
In my memory.
