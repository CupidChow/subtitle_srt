00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Long Ballad

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The Long Ballad

4
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Lord Jing

5
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Why don't you be my friend?

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Live a happy life

7
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Jingyuan, my good brother

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Come down and share the prosperity with us

9
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Yes

10
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The Long Ballad

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The candlelight dinner prepared by me

12
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You are lucky

13
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But the time is up

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Why is Jingyuan still not here?

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
He is so stupid

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I am sorry

17
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Today is the day of the disaster

18
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I will wait for you in the Donghua Garden

19
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Lord Jing

20
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Today is your 20th birthday

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
In my age

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
20 years old

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I was at the age of hot blood

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I am not afraid of difficulties

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I am brave to chase dreams

26
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I don't care about the ending

27
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I only care about the true heart

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
But you have been through a lot in this life

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I really feel unworthy of you for what you love

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
What nonsense is this girl talking about?

31
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
No, I can't have an interview

32
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I really care about your life

33
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I am the one who caused this

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
No, what should I do?

35
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But don't be afraid

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I will always be by your side

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Because you are my man

38
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I can only write your ending

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Yes, that's right

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Lord Jing

41
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Lord Jing

42
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I am here

43
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You can all leave

44
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes

45
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The human heart is the most important thing

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
The Tao is the most important thing

47
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
The breeze is gentle

48
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
The atmosphere is good

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The gold is the only thing

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The wind is strong

51
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I am the only one

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I am the only one

53
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I am the only one

54
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I am the only one

55
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The wind is strong

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The birthday gift I prepared

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
The ice mountain will melt tonight

58
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
The heart is the only thing

59
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The heart is the only thing

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Why did it fall down?

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Is this a punishment for me?

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Why did you do this to me?

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Xu Dong, come out

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I already know my fault

65
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Why can't you give me a chance?

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Xu Dong, come out

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I already know my fault

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Why can't you give me a chance?

69
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Xu Dong

70
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The flying fish and the fishnet

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
See you and me

72
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
The laughter and tears are all mixed up

73
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Life is a combination

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's all your fault

75
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's all your fault

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
The star in your eyes is full of sorrow

77
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Bearing its old logo

78
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
In íHabit must leave You

79
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I am sorry

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Let me do it

81
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Happy birthday to you.

82
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,400
Happy birthday to you.

83
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,600
Wish you happiness and health.

84
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,200
Have it.

85
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,400
Have it.

86
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,400
Xu Yuan, blow out the candles.

87
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,000
Xu Yuan?

88
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,200
Close your eyes.

89
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,200
I'll blow out the candles.

90
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,400
Close your eyes.

91
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,400
Make a wish.

92
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,800
Tell it to yourself.

93
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,000
Then blow out the candles.

94
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,400
Okay.

95
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,200
Have you made up your wish?

96
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,400
Yes.

97
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Blow out the candles.

98
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:04,400
Today, I prepared a candle-lit dinner for you at Wangchun Pavilion.

99
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,400
I even made you a birthday cake.

100
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
But this damn rain...

101
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,800
This is the first time I made a birthday cake, you know?

102
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,600
This is the first time I made a cake.

103
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,800
I know it all.

104
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,200
You know?

105
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,800
You lit a lot of candles at Wangchun Pavilion.

106
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,000
Good thing you didn't fall asleep.

107
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,200
Or else, you would have gotten into trouble again.

108
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,600
But what you did...

109
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,200
is all in my heart.

110
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,200
That...

111
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,800
Really?

112
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
You just sang it.

113
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,800
Happy birthday.

114
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,400
It's very nice.

115
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,200
It's very okay.

116
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:02,800
You actually remembered that it means very good?

117
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,600
Smart.

118
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,200
Okay.

119
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,800
Okay.

120
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,800
Okay.

121
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,400
Okay.

122
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,000
Okay.

123
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,800
This song is so nice.

124
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,600
Is it only popular among the people? Why haven't I heard it before?

125
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,400
It's called Happy Birthday.

126
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,400
At my house, it's a Beijing Chaoyang song.

127
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:31,200
Everyone sings it on their birthday.

128
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,800
Beijing Chaoyang song.

129
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,400
My house...

130
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,400
My house is a low-floor window.

131
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,400
A big floor.

132
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:46,400
And my soft sofa.

133
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,200
Although I don't understand,

134
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,400
I can feel that you really miss your home.

135
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,400
Since you came to the palace with me,

136
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,200
let's have an apple in the house.

137
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,600
Nonsense.

138
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,800
I'm a young girl. I started advertising when I was 12.

139
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,000
I was famous and was blacklisted.

140
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,600
But I...

141
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,800
was never poor.

142
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,800
I was advertising.

143
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,600
You were acting in a comic book for others to read.

144
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:22,200
You didn't know that I was so popular in my hometown.

145
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:25,200
I've acted in a female general.

146
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,800
A cook.

147
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,400
I also acted in a fairy tale.

148
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,000
What kind of stories are these?

149
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
They are all about love.

150
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,400
Didn't you say that

151
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,000
female general, cook and immortal?

152
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Yes.

153
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,800
General is in love with the enemy.

154
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,600
The cook is in love with the moment.

155
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,600
The fairy is in love with the fairy.

156
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,200
But they are all the same.

157
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Boring.

158
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,600
Since it's boring,

159
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,800
why did you act and ask for trouble?

160
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,000
Because acting is my dream.

161
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:28,000
When I was young, every summer,

162
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,200
everyone would gather together to watch a play.

163
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:39,000
This story is about a couple of sworn sisters.

164
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,000
My sister is a princess who is in the public.

165
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,400
My sister is a little soul wandering in the world.

166
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:50,000
They are each other's best friends.

167
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,600
They support each other and rely on each other.

168
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,600
But I...

169
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:01,200
I wish I wouldn't remember.

170
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,600
I thought

171
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,000
if I could, I would hide behind the character

172
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,200
and become a different kind of person.

173
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,000
Experience thousands of lives.

174
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
What about you?

175
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,400
What kind of person are you?

176
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,000
I...

177
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't know.

178
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,000
When you grow up, will you still act in this play?

179
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,000
Yes.

180
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,600
I'm acting. I'm always acting.

181
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,200
Okay.

182
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:09,000
I hope that I can see your play one day.

183
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,000
What's wrong?

184
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,600
Come here.

185
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
What's wrong?

186
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
Yang Yang, Shu Fang Village is very noisy lately.

187
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
They made the harem so noisy.

188
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,360
Hey, what's wrong with you?

189
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
Don't be angry.

190
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,000
Always be my love

191
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
We can never be together again

192
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
If love is enough

193
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
If it's enough, let's exchange our hands

194
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,800
I'll play the most romantic movie for you in my memory

195
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,800
You and I will take you into my life

196
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,800
The time I have left is not enough to tell you

197
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,000
Let all my longing become a back-up

198
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,200
The wind blows suddenly, the flowers in the ground are?

199
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,200
The flowers in the end are?

200
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,200
The flowers in the end are?

201
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,200
The flowers in the end are?

202
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:04,200
Love is enough

203
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,200
To go back to our own time

204
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:11,200
This time you said you missed it
