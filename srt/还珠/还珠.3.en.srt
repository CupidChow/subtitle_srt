1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The Legend of Chusen

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The Legend of Chusen

4
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I've been running for so long,

5
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I can't even find a thread of swallow's hair.

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The Legend of Chusen

7
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Xiao Yanzi!

8
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Xiao Yanzi!

9
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I've been looking for you for so long!

10
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Who are you?

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
How did you know me?

12
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How did I know you?

13
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I just saw a few little swallows flying by the sky.

14
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Look!

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Oh no, I have nothing to say.

16
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I, Ba Qi's brother, will soon be the king.

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Today, you'll see who is the best Batu dragon in Qing Dynasty.

18
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
The best Batu dragon in Qing Dynasty!

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Good!

20
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Er Kang,

21
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
is there anyone who doesn't want to be the best Batu dragon in Qing Dynasty,

22
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
but wants to be a horse-slaying donkey?

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Horse-slaying donkey?

24
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
You really haven't seen it for a day,

25
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
but you know it like crazy.

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Xiao Lu!

27
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You mean you're a palace maid?

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What's your name?

29
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What do you do in the palace?

30
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Which direction will the hunting team come from?

31
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Have you seen the emperor?

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What does the emperor look like?

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Do you usually eat roasted chicken in the palace?

34
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Little lady, don't ask, I have no words.

35
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Oh my god, you're so rich!

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm not rich.

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
I live in a big house.

38
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Although I live in a big house,

39
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm happy every day.

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Is it just the upper hand of the show,

41
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
not the upper hand of the leading role?

42
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Why am I not the leading role?

43
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I've never acted as a female role since I debuted.

44
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I've never acted as a female role since I debuted.

45
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
With such a small child,

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I can't let Xiao Yan get close to me.

47
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'm going to die here.

48
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You're so strange.

49
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I don't understand a word you say.

50
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I don't want to talk.

51
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Then I won't bother you.

52
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I'm leaving.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
My name is Lin Sui Sui.

54
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Dong Hao.

55
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm the maid of the Imperial Guards.

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Dong Hao.

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
This Dong Hao is useful.

58
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Imperial Guards?

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The kind with a high position.

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
As long as you go with me,

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I can take you to see the emperor.

62
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I can take you to see the emperor.

63
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I can take you to see the emperor.

64
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I can take you to see the emperor.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I can take you to see the emperor.

66
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I can take you to see the emperor.

67
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Emperor?

68
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Great.

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What's wrong with you again?

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
So hopeless.

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Why is it like this?

72
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Go.

73
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
The Imperial Guards are coming.

74
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Finally, we can get into the plot.

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
My stomach hurts.

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It hurts.

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Go that way.

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Go that way.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You can see the emperor.

80
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Okay. Go. I'll be back in a minute.

81
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll catch up with you right away.

82
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Then you go back quickly.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
I...

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Go.

85
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Go.

86
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
What happened?

87
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's not moving.

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Could it be hanging?

89
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Yongqin.

90
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Report to the emperor.

91
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It seems that I shot a civilian girl.

92
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Go and have a look.

93
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes.

94
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yongqin.

95
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What happened?

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What happened?

97
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What happened?

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
What happened?

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What happened?

100
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
What happened?

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What happened?

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Xiao Yanzi.

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Xiao Yanzi, wake up.

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Xiao Yanzi.

105
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
You can't die.

106
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
If the plot doesn't work,

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
we'll be in trouble.

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
How dare you!

109
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Who are you?

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
How dare you trespass into the imperial court.

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Is this the Princess?

112
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Who is this?

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
We're back in the imperial court.

114
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
This person may be the princess.

115
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This person may be the villagers nearby.

116
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Emperor.

117
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Emperor.

118
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Emperor still remembers the name of the partner.

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Xia Yuhe.

120
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Hurry up.

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Call for help.

122
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The Emperor's Mansion

123
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The plot went smoothly.

124
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I got a bonus.

125
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes.

126
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I got a bonus.

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You saved the Empress's confidant.

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
The Empress's confidant

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
The Empress ordered me to take you to the capital

130
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
to confirm your words.

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
If you don't wake up,

132
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
it's your conspiracy with that girl.

133
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm innocent.

134
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I can't control the Fifth Prince's assassin.

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Besides,

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm just a kind person.

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Is it important to save someone?

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Who is the Xia Yuhe of the Lake of the Ming Dynasty?

139
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
How do I know?

140
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
How do I know?

141
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
The villain is also the main character.

142
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
If you want to live,

143
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
you have to hug the Empress's thigh.

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
But

145
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
the name

146
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
sounds like a woman.

147
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
And

148
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
she's a talented woman.

149
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What about the Emperor?

150
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You know...

151
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Shut up.

152
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Jingyue.

153
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
How did you know

154
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
that the Empress's confidant

155
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
is the main character?

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This witch must be a spy.

157
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
She has a conspiracy with the Pearl Princess.

158
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
She's trying to seduce the Emperor.

159
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
She deserves to be killed.

160
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Please spare my life.

161
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Please spare my life.

162
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Please spare my life.

163
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Please spare my life.

164
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
The witch?

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I'm familiar with this.

166
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The Emperor's confidant

167
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
is the main character

168
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
who has the power to make the sword.

169
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
She is

170
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Yao Chi,

171
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
the fairy

172
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
and the goddess of the Empyrean Heaven.

173
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Xintong.

174
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The Princess of the Wu Realm came to the world

175
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
to tell us

176
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
about the love

177
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
between us.

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
The Empress's confidant

179
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Since you're the fairy,

180
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
you must be

181
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
not afraid of any apologies.

182
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Lord Jing.

183
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
What's wrong with me?

184
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Did I faint again?

185
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Where am I?

186
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm sick.

187
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I always fainted for no reason.

188
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I didn't even know

189
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
where I was when I woke up.

190
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
The fortune teller said

191
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I couldn't continue

192
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
the story.

193
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I need more people.

194
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm tired.

195
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I'll go to Kunning Palace for work.

196
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

197
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
The Imperial College

198
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
The Imperial College.

199
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The Imperial College.

200
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I want to go to the Imperial College.

201
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
It's a big palace.

202
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
How can I go without the Imperial College?

203
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
The Imperial College is here.

204
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Lord Jing.

205
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Lord Jing.

206
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You can't go into the palace.

207
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Lord Jing, where are you going?

208
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You want me to go to the Shufang House

209
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
to deliver something.

210
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You're not on duty in Kunning Palace.

211
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Why are you running around?

212
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
I'm Nanny Rong.

213
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
She told me to go to the Shufang House

214
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
to deliver some snacks.

215
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Such a big palace...

216
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Shut up.

217
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm lost as I walk.

218
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
She promised to

219
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
leave me some warmth.

220
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Hurry up.

221
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I...

222
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Thank you for your hair.

223
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Let go.

224
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,000
You little prankster.

225
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
What's wrong with her?

226
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Pearl Princess is from the Ming family.

227
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
She knows nothing about the rules of the palace.

228
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
From now on, I'll teach her well.

229
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You should learn from her.

230
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Come on.

231
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Stand up.

232
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Come on.

233
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Stand up.

234
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Come on.

235
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Get off the steps.

236
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Let's go.

237
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Lord Jing.

238
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Love once is enough.

239
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
After the end.

240
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Back to our own space.

241
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
This time you said

242
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
it's enough.

243
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The color of the candlelight

244
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
doesn't move.

245
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
The flower in the butterfly's cocoon

246
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
is?

247
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
The flowers in the blood red

248
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
are all stained with ink.

249
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:14,780
The

250
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,780
heart is burning.

251
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:16,780
The heart is beating fast.

252
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,780
The secret of the sky and the wind

253
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,780
is like a dagger in the heart.

254
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,780
Always be my love.

255
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:25,780
I can't hide from your clues.

256
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,780
Always be my love.

257
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,780
We can never be together again.

258
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,780
If love is enough,

259
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:37,780
then let's spend the rest of our lives together.

260
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,780
I'll play the most romantic movie for you.

261
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,780
I'll play it in my memory.

262
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,780
You play it and I'll play it for you.

263
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:43,780
I'll play it in my memory.

264
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,780
It's destined.

265
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,780
The time you give me is not enough.

266
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,780
I'll tell you everything.

267
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,780
Let the longing become a river.

268
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,780
The color of the candlelight doesn't move.

269
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,780
The flower in the butterfly's cocoon is?

270
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,780
The flower in the blood red is?

271
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,780
The heart is beating fast.

272
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,780
The flower in the butterfly's cocoon is?

273
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,780
The heart is beating fast.

274
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,780
The heart is beating fast.

275
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,780
The heart is beating fast.

276
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,780
The heart is beating fast.

277
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:11,780
Love once is enough.

278
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,780
From now on,

279
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,780
we'll go back to our own space.

280
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:18,780
This time you said you missed me.
