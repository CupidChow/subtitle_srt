1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The Legend of Chusen

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The Legend of Chusen

4
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry, Xiao Yan Zi.

5
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Actually, that turtle is a five-headed turtle.

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I know.

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
You did this because you like Lord Jing.

8
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
No.

9
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
It seems that it's not impossible for you to understand.

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
As long as you don't like Shang Jing Yuan,

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
everything will be able to be promoted smoothly.

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You just want me to hate Lord Jing, right?

13
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Lord Jing is a man of high martial arts and a man of good character.

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I like him.

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
But you are so attentive.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
It can be seen that you are in love with him.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What is love?

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Love is the same.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Yes.

20
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Anyway, you like him very much.

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I, Xiao Yan Zi, am the most righteous person.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm the first sister.

23
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I will never, never

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
take the first-class person of a good sister.

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Is it so deep?

26
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Xiao Yan Zi.

27
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Don't look at me like that.

28
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm embarrassed.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Lin Er.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You are my savior.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
No matter who you like,

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I will definitely help you get along.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Get along.

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'll help you copy the 100-word-3-word-chord.

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Anyway, my words are as ugly as you.

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Lin Er.

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Lin Er.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
You are my savior.

39
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What is that?

40
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
OK.

41
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Very OK.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I always thought this was a world of stories.

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
They are all people in the story.

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
But at this moment,

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Xiao Yan Zi's loyalty to me is real.

46
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
My love for him is also real.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Since the feelings are real,

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
then these people are all real people

49
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
with blood and flesh for me.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You...

51
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
deserve it.

52
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Hey!

53
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You waited for me for so long just to scold me?

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You are not young anymore.

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
It's time to think about the great thing in life.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
If you have something you like,

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
you can tell me.

58
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
In the future, the woman you want to marry

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
will be in terms of appearance,

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
in terms of character.

61
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
She will die.

62
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
In terms of talent,

63
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
she hasn't finished teaching me yet.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
She just let me go.

65
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
That's the first-class existence.

66
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
If you lose,

67
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'll make you die.

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Deal.

69
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Yuan Er.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Yuan Er.

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yes, Your Highness.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Since Princess Huan Zhu doesn't know literature,

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
don't make Mr. Ji angry again.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Let him follow you.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
You are a martial artist.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
It's better to teach him.

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Yes, Your Highness.

78
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Princess Huan Zhu loves to use her sword.

79
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Your Highness ordered Lord Jing to teach her martial arts

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
and to put her in the top position.

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
She will definitely admire Lord Jing

82
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
and be in love with him.

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
This child is in trouble.

84
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I feel sorry for her.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
If I can be a mother,

86
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
the gossip in the palace will stop.

87
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Please stand still, Your Highness.

88
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Lord Jing,

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I've stood for a whole incense stick.

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I really can't stand it.

91
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
This is the order of the empress.

92
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I dare not be disheartened.

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Please hold on.

94
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Just two more incense sticks.

95
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What if I really can't stand it?

96
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Raise your head.

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I'm dying.

98
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's ridiculous for them to stay together all the time.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
What can I do

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
to make the Fifth Prince compete in the competition?

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Mr. Ji's class today

102
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
really makes me feel sorry.

103
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Right?

104
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Yes.

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm sorry.

106
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I apologize to the Fifth Prince.

107
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Greetings, Mr. Fu.

108
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Why are you in such a hurry?

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I went to the dance studio

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
to send the snacks to Princess Huan Zhu.

111
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I found that the princess

112
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
was tortured by Lord Jing

113
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and almost passed out.

114
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
It's been two hours.

115
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Lord Jing is so scared and so serious.

116
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He didn't give the princess a chance to breathe.

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I thought about

118
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
preparing some of her favorite snacks

119
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
for the princess

120
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
and send them to her

121
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
to calm her down.

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Jing Yu

123
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
is always so strict.

124
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Xiao Yan Zi is here for the first time.

125
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
She's having a hard time

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
climbing on her hands.

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Er Kang, let's go and have a look.

128
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Don't hurt her.

129
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Yes.

130
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Xiao Yan Zi.

131
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Yong Qi.

132
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
If you two don't come,

133
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'll be tortured by that police officer.

134
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's okay.

135
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Although Jing Yu is a serious person,

136
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
she's doing this for your own good.

137
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Jing Yu has been very strict since she was a child.

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
She's trying to push you.

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
What do you mean?

140
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I think she just wants to...

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
She just wants to kill me.

142
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Okay, okay.

143
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I won't be too strict.

144
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
How about this?

145
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'll ask the Imperial Kitchen to make you lotus seed cakes.

146
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Lotus seed cakes?

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Okay.

148
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I don't just want lotus seed cakes.

149
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I also want plum seed cakes, peach seed cakes, and orange seed cakes.

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I want them all.

151
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Okay, okay.

152
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I want them all.

153
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I want them all.

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Xiao Yan Zi.

155
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Li Yi!

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Xiao Yan Zi, we're not in a hurry.

157
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Let's go back to the Imperial Kitchen and rest.

158
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
The plum seed cakes, peach seed cakes, and lotus seed cakes are all yours.

159
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Prince Yongqi is right.

160
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
His is definitely better.

161
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
You're so cruel!

162
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Slow down.

163
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Let's go.

164
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Let's go.

165
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Didn't I just copy it a hundred times?

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm really a little jade ghost.

167
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
You're the palace maid, Lin Cui Cui, right?

168
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Come with me.

169
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Her Highness wants to see you.

170
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Let's go.

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You servant.

172
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You really are on the same side with Pearl Princess.

173
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
I just let you go for a few days.

174
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm not going to let you go.

175
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm going to go to the palace.

176
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'm going to go to the palace.

177
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I'm going to go to the palace.

178
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'm going to go to the palace.

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I'm going to go to the palace.

180
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm going to go to the palace.

181
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm going to let you go for a few days.

182
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Your fox tail can't hide anymore.

183
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
You're wronged.

184
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:49,320
I helped Xiao Yanzi to get the

185
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Consort Ling.

186
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
What?

187
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,000
No wonder Pearl Princess went out to worship Heaven.

188
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Er Kang asked for a leave.

189
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Worship Heaven?

190
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
So Ziwei is going to appear.

191
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Consort Ling is watching Pearl Princess get favored.

192
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Want to make Er Kang a father.

193
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Good算盤.

194
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I'll tie him up right now.

195
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Go to Consort Ling's palace to fight.

196
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Wait a minute.

197
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Wait a minute.

198
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I have a way to prove my innocence.

199
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Please allow me to go out of the palace with you.

200
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I can let Lord Fu get rid of the idea of being a father.

201
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
If I can't do it,

202
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I'll follow your will.

203
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I'm tired.

204
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Go.

205
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

206
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
God of Chicken has his own destiny.

207
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
My head is like a stick.

208
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's a stick.

209
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
My head is like a stick.

210
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
After the day of worship,

211
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Her Majesty will definitely get rid of my doubts.

212
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
She will use me as a shield.

213
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
She won't kill me easily.

214
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I'm going to have a good life as a woman.

215
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Pearl Princess is ordered to worship Heaven.

216
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Worship Heaven for the people.

217
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Pearl Princess is ordered to worship Heaven for the people.

218
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Long live Your Highness.

219
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Long live Your Highness.

220
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Long live Your Highness.

221
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Long live Your Highness.

222
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Long live Your Highness.

223
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Long live Your Highness.

224
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Why are you here?

225
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm here to escort Her Highness.

226
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,000
I shouldn't be here to worship Heaven.

227
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Shouldn't I be here to worship Heaven?

228
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
His Majesty ordered me to come home with you.

229
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
What?

230
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You're concerned about Er Kang?

231
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
What are you talking about?

232
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
What did you say?

233
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I said I'm more concerned about you, Lord Jing.

234
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What are you doing here?

235
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
It's none of your business.

236
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I'm looking at the scenery.

237
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Is there anything wrong?

238
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
What's so beautiful about the street?

239
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Are you asking why today, Lord Jing?

240
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I'm observing life.

241
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
If you want to play a good show, you have to observe life.

242
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Right?

243
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
That's not true.

244
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You do know how to act.

245
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Sometimes people can't touch their brains.

246
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I don't know if you're real or fake.

247
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Smart women have to keep a sense of mystery.

248
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
They're too honest and easy to get hurt.

249
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Xiao Yan Zi.

250
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Xiao Yan Zi.

251
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Hello, everyone.

252
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Xiao Yan Zi.

253
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Xiao Yan Zi.

254
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Xiao Yan Zi.

255
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Xiao Yan Zi.

256
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
She's not a princess.

257
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
She's not a princess.

258
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Stop it!

259
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
She's not a princess.

260
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Princess Huan Zhu, you're here.

261
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
