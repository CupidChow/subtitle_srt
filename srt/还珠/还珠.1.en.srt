1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
5th generation

2
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:16,480
With great incident

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:17,880
One more Pomelo

4
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:48,880
What happened?

5
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,880
What happened?

6
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:57,880
Please tell father

7
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,880
I think I was attacked by a female

8
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,880
Xiao Yanzi, wake up

9
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,880
Xiao Yanzi, Xiao Yanzi

10
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,880
You can't die

11
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:06,880
If the plot doesn't go well

12
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,880
We will be punished

13
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:08,880
How dare you

14
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,880
Who are you

15
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,880
How dare you break into the royal hall

16
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,880
Xiao Yanzi, the emperor is here

17
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,880
Don't you have something to say to him

18
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,880
Emperor, emperor

19
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,880
Emperor loves me

20
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,880
The famous partner

21
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,880
Xia Yiheng

22
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,880
Hurry up, save people

23
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,880
Hurry up, save people

24
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,880
Hurry up, save people

25
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,880
Hurry up, save people

26
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,880
Hurry up, save people

27
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,880
Hurry up, save people

28
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,880
Hurry up, save people

29
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,880
Hurry up, save people

30
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,880
Hurry up, save people

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,880
Hurry up, save people

32
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,880
Hurry up, save people

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,880
Hurry up, save people

34
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,880
Hurry up, save people

35
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,880
Hurry up, save people

36
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,880
Hurry up, save people

37
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,880
Hurry up, save people

38
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,880
The people of the village are in a panic

39
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,880
The song of wine and the song of song

40
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,880
The joy of heart

41
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,880
The youth of my youth

42
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,880
Let us be together

43
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,880
My laughter

44
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,880
The people of the village are in a panic

45
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,880
The song of wine and the song of song

46
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,880
The joy of heart

47
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,880
The youth of my youth

48
00:02:46,880 --> 00:03:00,580
الساه

49
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,560
I lost my tears down in the cold

50
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,640
I always keep that shit inside

51
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,040
I can't stop thinking about you

52
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,040
Thank you, thank you

53
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
I just like you

54
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,040
Thank you, thank you

55
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,040
Thank you, thank you

56
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,040
Director, Sui Cui's role

57
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,040
It's like this, Sui Cui

58
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,040
Our super-poll selection of roles has been broadcast

59
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
The role can't be changed

60
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,200
What do you say, say it again

61
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,200
There is no small role, only small actors

62
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,200
Is it a problem to play someone, director?

63
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,200
Yes

64
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,200
This problem is

65
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,200
What do I play without emotional lines?

66
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,200
Drink tea and water

67
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:10,200
Not suitable

68
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:15,200
But the theme of our issue is Pearl Princess

69
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,360
Pearl Princess, you are a palace maid

70
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,360
This

71
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,360
Who said that the palace maid can't have emotional lines?

72
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,360
Is it

73
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,360
Sui Cui, what do you think about this emotional line?

74
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,360
As for this emotional line

75
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
My male lead

76
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,360
His presence must not be defeated by the Fifth Prince Helkang

77
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,360
The outside is cold like a mountain

78
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,360
Life and death

79
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,360
The bottom line

80
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,360
Dong

81
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,360
Director Miao

82
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,360
Call me when the script is ready

83
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,360
Okay

84
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,360
Okay

85
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,360
Let him fall by himself

86
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,360
Even if there is a palace maid

87
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,360
I must be the leading role

88
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,520
I must be the leading role

89
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,520
Where is this

90
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:43,520
Is this the male lead for my family?

91
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,520
The crew has put a lot of effort into this

92
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,520
Deserve me

93
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:54,520
What is this plot

94
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,520
Isn't he here to fall in love with me?

95
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,520
Let go

96
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,520
You are not a girl

97
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,520
You are not a girl

98
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,680
Let go

99
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,680
Why are you so hard

100
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,680
It hurts me

101
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,680
What are you doing

102
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,680
You can't act in this group

103
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,680
Director

104
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,680
I said no

105
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,840
Director

106
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,840
Sir, I am here

107
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
Brother, wake up

108
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,840
Wake up

109
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,840
Wake up

110
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,840
If you are still as quiet as before

111
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,840
this slave is your end

112
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,680
Why is she really dead?

113
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,680
Where is this place?

114
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,680
This sword is from Princess Pearl.

115
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:15,680
Everyone's fate was written in the script.

116
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,680
Lady Lin changed the script at will.

117
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,680
This caused a lot of trouble.

118
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,680
Now, the real and fake princesses are all in their places.

119
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
What's that sound?

120
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,680
It's said that fate is fated to be mixed with chaos.

121
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,680
Who's talking?

122
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,680
The world is about to be destroyed.

123
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,680
Only by causing chaos and rebelling,

124
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,680
this sword and Lady Lin can all return to their places.

125
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,680
It's you.

126
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,680
Me?

127
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,680
So, I've been through the world of the script?

128
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,680
My hero, his presence,

129
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,680
can't be defeated by Fifth Prince and Er Kang.

130
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,680
The so-called killing god, Kuri,

131
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
hatred for the sea, love for the sky,

132
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,680
life and death, one line.

133
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,680
Tell me, who are you?

134
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,680
My current life is...

135
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,680
I...

136
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,680
I'm a lower-ranking palace maid from the Hall of?

137
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,680
I work hard everyday.

138
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,680
Stop talking nonsense.

139
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,680
Tell me what you want to know.

140
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,680
Good for you.

141
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,680
Luckily, you've seen it.

142
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,680
Why is it written in the script?

143
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,680
I...

144
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,680
I'm just a sixth-ranking palace maid.

145
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,680
In this palace,

146
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,680
I'm alone, alone,

147
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,680
and lonely.

148
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,680
Shut up!

149
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,680
Who brought you in here?

150
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,680
How am I supposed to answer this?

151
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
What's this?

152
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,680
A code?

153
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,680
You're dead.

154
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,680
I...

155
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,680
According to the old rules,

156
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,680
if you want to live, you must find a backer.

157
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,680
I said...

158
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,680
That person...

159
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,680
looks cold as ice,

160
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,680
and has a heart of a tiger.

161
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,680
He only has a warm heart for me.

162
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,680
That person is...

163
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
Who?

164
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,680
I don't know if you're my man.

165
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,680
I'm scared. You...

166
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,680
Your Highness, you should rest.

167
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,680
His Majesty ordered the Office of Justice to investigate the case of the palace maid's pulse.

168
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,680
There's no result so far.

169
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,680
I'm the master of the six palaces.

170
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,680
How can I explain to His Majesty?

171
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,680
The investigation is under the supervision of Lord Jing.

172
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,680
Her ability...

173
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
Your Highness is always clear about her.

174
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
I, Yang Zi,

175
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,680
always do things according to the rules.

176
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,680
You bitch!

177
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,680
The palace maid is a criminal.

178
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,680
How dare you slander Lord Jing?

179
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,680
So it's a case of investigating the case of the palace maid's identity.

180
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,680
Am I the palace maid who bought the identity and attacked her?

181
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,680
You still don't admit your crime?

182
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,680
It's my aunt.

183
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,680
She wanted to frame me.

184
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,680
You...

185
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,680
dare to hit my face?

186
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,680
You little bitch!

187
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,680
How dare you hit me?

188
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,680
I'll beat you!

189
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,680
Stop!

190
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,680
The bracelet of Granny Wu is not like ordinary people.

191
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,680
This character is a little bit old.

192
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,680
Is this bracelet of Granny Song?

193
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,680
Report to Lord Jing.

194
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,680
The Office of Justice has made me change my clothes.

195
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,680
They asked me and Granny Wu to come to the trial.

196
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,680
It has been a long time since I changed my clothes.

197
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,680
The familiar atmosphere.

198
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,680
They must be partners.

199
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,680
So you're blaming me.

200
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,680
I dare not.

201
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,680
Granny Song is so simple.

202
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,680
Why did you forget to change your shoes?

203
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,680
You're a mother who is holding a jade phoenix.

204
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,680
How can you wear such a luxurious material like the edge of the zhangrong?

205
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,680
I was too careless.

206
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
So I changed my clothes.

207
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,680
But I asked Granny Wu to wear a luxurious bracelet.

208
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,680
So I can be suspicious of her.

209
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,680
Sir!

210
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,680
Sir!

211
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,680
I found this in Granny Song's room.

212
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,680
The internal affairs office's evidence.

213
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,680
The evidence of the various departments.

214
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
The fake household register,

215
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
The fake household register,

216
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,680
The fake household register, the identity of the servant.

217
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,680
How dare you!

218
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,680
It's dangerous to be out of the way for the time being.

219
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,680
Let's talk about the first step of the fire first.

220
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,680
Get up!

221
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,680
Granny!

222
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,680
Calm down!

223
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,680
What's going on?

224
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,680
I'm so weird, right?

225
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:54,680
Granny, calm down.

226
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,680
Since you dare to betray me,

227
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,680
Then I'll let you die with me.

228
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,680
Is this...

229
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,680
He wants to...

230
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,680
Did you...

231
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,680
Forget it?

232
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,680
You are...

233
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,680
This...

234
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,680
What's going on?

235
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,680
This is a hint of the lines.

236
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
Once the lines are exhausted,

237
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,680
The character will die.

238
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,680
And disappear in the world of the Pearl.

239
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,680
Why didn't you say it earlier?

240
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,680
What did he mean?

241
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,680
What do you mean?

242
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,680
How do I know what he meant?

243
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,680
Tell me the truth.

244
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,680
You risked your life to attack.

245
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,680
What did you do?

246
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,680
I didn't do anything.

247
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,680
What's your purpose of taking the risk to attack?

248
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,680
Guards!

249
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,680
Yes!

250
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,680
Take him to the capital.

251
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,680
Yes!

252
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,680
What the hell did I do?

253
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,680
The empress is here!

254
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,680
The biggest death in the Pearl.

255
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,680
The empress?

256
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,680
