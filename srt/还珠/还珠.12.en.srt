4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
This Jingyuan is really unkind.

5
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He's just my type.

6
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
What should I do to make him calm down?

7
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I have a plan.

8
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Find a few men to kidnap Ling'er.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
When she sees the woman she cares about in trouble,

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
she won't be able to hold back her true feelings.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
She will definitely save her beauty.

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
No.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
True feelings are the most important thing.

14
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Although Xiao Yanzi's method can help Mr. Jing to get over his worries,

15
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
the care he got is fake.

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Ling'er, if you really want to make up with Mr. Jing,

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
you have to give him your true feelings.

18
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Let him see what you really are.

19
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I always believe that

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
loving someone is loving his glory,

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
and loving his messiness.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Two people who truly love each other can give up a lot of things,

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
but they will never give up on each other.

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
True feelings.

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Is he the tool I use to repair my story,

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
or my true feelings?

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I wonder how long he can stay in your world.

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Let's get along well.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Episode 10

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Be careful, Ziwei.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
It's stuck here.

32
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Here, you two.

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Let me do it.

34
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Give it to me.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Thank you, sir.

36
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Xiao Yanzi, Ling'er has been out for a long time.

37
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Why hasn't she come back yet?

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
That's right.

39
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Where did she go?

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You still have the nerve to ask?

41
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It's all because of you.

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You always look so sad.

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
She thinks that when you see her,

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
you'll think that she likes to act.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
She said that she went out for a walk.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
She went out to buy me some snacks.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
She's being too selfish.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
It's getting dark.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
There are many people out there.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Is it dangerous for her to be alone in a house with a little girl?

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
That's right.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What's so dangerous about her?

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
She'll be back soon.

54
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
How can she not be here?

55
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Thank you, sir.

56
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Let's pack up.

57
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If Jingyuan receives this gift,

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
she won't be so embarrassed, right?

59
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Little girl, don't go.

60
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Didn't you say that you won't act in the next episode?

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
What are you doing?

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Which one do you want to act in?

63
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Big brother, it's over.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Whoever comes to you, go ask for money.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
You're so nosy. Let's go.

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
My kite.

67
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Let go.

68
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Help.

69
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Help.

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Go.

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Go.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Jingyuan.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I knew it.

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I knew you wouldn't leave me alone.

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's broken.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What is this?

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
This is the gift I gave you.

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
How can it be so difficult to prepare a gift for you?

79
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Because I'm broken.

80
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
So you pretended to be pregnant

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
just to help me

82
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
and act in a play?

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Do you like acting so much?

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Do you like to fool people?

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
No.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I don't.

87
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Xiao Yanzi said she wanted to act in this play.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I didn't agree.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Ziwei said that

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
if I really want to give you a gift,

91
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I really want to treat you well.

92
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Jingyuan, why can't you believe me?

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
I don't know.

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
If you don't believe me,

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
go ask Xiao Yanzi and Ziwei.

96
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
It's because you're so good at acting.

97
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Sometimes I don't know

98
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
if it's true or not.

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But you forgot

100
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm the doctor of the Heart and Soul Division.

101
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I won't easily kill anyone

102
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
if there's no evidence.

103
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Lin Sui Sui,

104
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I can't trust you anymore.

105
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
What evidence?

106
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Tell me!

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
What happened just now is real.

108
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's all real.

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Lin'er!

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Lin'er!

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Lin'er, let's go to the horse race later.

112
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
How about it?

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Yes, you can win Xiao Yanzi.

114
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Lin'er.

115
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Lin'er, are you and Jingyuan okay?

116
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes, I saw Jingyuan

117
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
looking for you on the street yesterday.

118
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm sorry.

119
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's okay.

120
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm sorry.

121
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Xiao Yanzi.

122
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Ziwei.

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

124
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
But

125
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
it's so hard

126
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
to exchange a person's heart

127
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
with another person's heart.

128
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm tired.

129
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Let me calm down.

130
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Lin...

131
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Xiao Yanzi, let her calm down.

132
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Oh no, it must be the fire in the bed.

133
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Your Highness,

134
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
we have completed the task as you instructed.

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
No more information?

136
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
No, everything is as you instructed.

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Okay, take it to the room.

138
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

139
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

140
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Those who are out, don't call me Your Highness anymore.

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yes, Your Highness.

142
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Stop it.

143
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It seems that we are going to have dinner in the wild today.

144
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Let's get ready.

145
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Ziwei and I will go to the nearby farmhouse to buy some food.

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Okay.

147
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Let's go to the wild.

148
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Jingyuan, let's go.

149
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's good to go to the wild.

150
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Lin, let's go to the wild together.

151
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'll feed the horse first.

152
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I have a way to go in the afternoon.

153
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Feed the horse?

154
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's none of our business.

155
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Feed the horse.

156
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
I'm not going.

157
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I'll go to pick some firewood.

158
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Xiao Yanzi, don't you like to go to the wild?

159
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Let's go together.

160
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
It's interesting.

161
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Is it the time to go to the wild?

162
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Jingyuan, wait for me.

163
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What's wrong with Xiao Yanzi today?

164
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Yes, it's strange.

165
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
She has been surrounding Jingyuan all day.

166
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
You are just a paper liar.

167
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
How dare you show me your face?

168
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
If I had known, I would have written a book about you.

169
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
You sit on the wheelchair all day.

170
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll see how you feed the horse.

171
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Lin, what's going on between you and Jingyuan?

172
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm a lower-class maid.

173
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
She is a royal concubine.

174
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
We can't fight.

175
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Who is the first to bow first?

176
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Prince V, Xiao Yanzi thinks it's fun to feed the horse.

177
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
That's why she is laughing so happily.

178
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Whoever she is with will find it fun.

179
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Maybe I'm just one of her partners.

180
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Oh, no.

181
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I really misunderstood this time.

182
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Next is the play of the leading role Ding Qin.

183
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
But don't ruin my long-term CPC.

184
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Prince V, don't misunderstand.

185
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm not.

186
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm not.

187
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Prince V, don't misunderstand.

188
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Xiao Yanzi...

189
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Xiao Yanzi knows that I'm having a fight with Jingyuan.

190
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
She's there to help me.

191
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
She cares about you.

192
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Really?

193
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Of course.

194
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,000
If you don't believe me, you can...

195
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
find a chance to talk to her.

196
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Xiao Yanzi...

197
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm here.

198
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I'm here.

199
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
I have to talk to her.

200
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Xiao Yanzi.

201
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Youqian, look.

202
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Jingyuan caught a rabbit in her hand.

203
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I have something to tell you.

204
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Come with me.

205
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Jingyuan.

206
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
You and Lin'er are making trouble.

207
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
It's your business.

208
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
But can you stop making trouble for Xiao Yanzi?

209
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Yingqi.

210
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Are you making trouble with me?

211
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'm not making trouble with you.

212
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I think you're making trouble.

213
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
All right.

214
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,000
All right.

215
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You two are not allowed to make trouble.

216
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
I fell on my own.

217
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
It's been a long time since I've played with you.

218
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I wonder if you've improved.

219
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
All right.

220
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'll know in a moment.

221
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
I'll keep an eye on you.

222
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'm here.

223
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I'm here.

224
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm here.

225
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'm here.

226
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'm here.

227
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm here.

228
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm here.

229
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I'm here.

230
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'm here.

231
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm here.

232
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I'm here.

233
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm here.

234
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,000
I'm here.

235
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I'm here.

236
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I'm here.

237
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm here.

238
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I'm here.

239
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm here.

240
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'm here.

241
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I'm here.

242
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm here.

243
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I'm here.

244
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm here.

245
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
I'm here.

246
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm here.

247
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I'm here.

248
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm here.

249
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I'm here.

250
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I'm here.

251
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Love once is enough.

252
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
After the end,

253
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
we'll go back to our own space.

254
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,000
This time you said you missed me.
