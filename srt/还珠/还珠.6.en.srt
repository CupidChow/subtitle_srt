1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,000
The Legend of Chusen

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The Legend of Chusen

4
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
There's an assassin!

5
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Assassin!

6
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
He's not a princess!

7
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'll make the princess's name come true!

8
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
He's coming!

9
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Stop him!

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Look!

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Ziwei!

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Great! It's Ziwei!

13
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Xiao Yanzi!

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Erkang, there's a suspicious person behind us.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You go check the back.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I'll be here to prevent the assassin from attacking us.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Okay.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let go of me!

19
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Xiao Yanzi!

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
If you're a princess,

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
what am I then?

22
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What am I then?

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Erkang!

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
What are you doing?

25
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Don't fight!

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Let go!

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Don't fight!

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Don't fight!

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Erkang...

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Don't fight!

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't fight!

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Don't fight!

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Beat him!

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,280
Your Majesty.

35
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,440
Your Majesty.

36
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,360
Er Kang.

37
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,880
Fan Er Kang, turn around.

38
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,680
That's Zi Wei.

39
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,160
That's your Zi Wei.

40
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,080
Turn around.

41
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,280
Turn around.

42
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,520
Your Majesty.

43
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,240
Stop.

44
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,320
Stop.

45
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,280
Stop.

46
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,240
She's a weak woman.

47
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,880
Don't you hear her?

48
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,560
Is it reasonable to beat her like this?

49
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,600
You're a team.

50
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,720
Keep beating her.

51
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,320
Go.

52
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,360
Don't pull me. Get out of my way.

53
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,040
Why are you so impulsive?

54
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,240
They couldn't extend their arms,

55
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,680
couldn't push them back.

56
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,540
Enough.

57
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:31,940
Enough.

58
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,800
нее

59
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,440
Permanent hydippers are here.

60
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,120
Permanent nivel heat waves

61
00:03:50,120 --> 00:04:10,460
I

62
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,980
The main plot has been completed

63
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,620
Fold to new character

64
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,120
The End

65
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,520
You're awake.

66
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,360
Where is that girl?

67
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:34,760
Where is she?

68
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,200
Have some water first.

69
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,280
That girl was taken back by Lord Fu.

70
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:44,800
But you

71
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,800
saved her without any care.

72
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,720
What's your relationship?

73
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,280
She...

74
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,080
She's a friend of my childhood.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,040
A friend of your childhood?

76
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,040
You haven't seen her for years.

77
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,480
How can you see her?

78
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,640
Besides, she looks weak.

79
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,640
Do you know if she has a friend?

80
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,920
If you disturb her defense,

81
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,040
she'll take the opportunity to attack you.

82
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,320
No.

83
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,040
I trust her.

84
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,320
She was the one

85
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,880
who looked weak

86
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,400
but was brave inside.

87
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,280
Cai Qian

88
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,840
is braver than before.

89
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,600
You look

90
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,320
different today.

91
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,920
What's the past?

92
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,680
You were selfish

93
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,200
and lied to yourself.

94
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,760
You look different today.

95
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,040
How?

96
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,800
I didn't expect that the living King of Yan

97
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,480
has a heart to save the beauty.

98
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,880
Lord Jing, thank you.

99
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,840
You're welcome.

100
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,440
Ling'er, come here.

101
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,880
Did you

102
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,960
save a commoner today?

103
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,760
I didn't save her.

104
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,440
Lord Fu saved her.

105
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,880
Tell me

106
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,160
what she looks like.

107
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,600
She looks like a beauty.

108
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,080
But she has a brave heart.

109
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,280
By the way,

110
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,080
Her Majesty said

111
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,120
her name is Ziwei.

112
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,360
It's Ziwei.

113
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,320
She's actually...

114
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,080
I can't say it.

115
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,440
Ling'er,

116
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,000
she's staying with Lord Fu now.

117
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,840
Tell me

118
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,600
how can I see her?

119
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,120
Xiao Yanzi,

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,360
if she can't enter the palace,

121
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,800
you can go out to see her.

122
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,840
It's not easy to get out of the palace.

123
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,440
Who are you?

124
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:11,680
You're Xiao Yanzi.

125
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,840
You can't just

126
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,120
walk across the wall

127
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,240
with your skills.

128
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,320
It makes sense.

129
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,160
anniquren

130
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,160
What's the most important thing inescapable thing?

131
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,800
Turning the slap on the face of men.

132
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,320
I must say one more thing first.

133
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,200
What is it?

134
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,680
Battle helicopter?

135
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,000
What is it?

136
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,440
Awesome!

137
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,440
A helicopter?

138
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,160
Oh.

139
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,400
Well.

140
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,240
It's the beauty of the world.

141
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,720
You need to practice your handwriting.

142
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,840
Your handwriting is just like

143
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,880
the Princess of Soul Bead.

144
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,000
What do you know?

145
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,280
I'm just a rabbit.

146
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,800
Do you know how many big stars like me

147
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,640
are longing for my rabbit?

148
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,680
You're talking nonsense again.

149
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,600
You're so ugly.

150
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,400
Forget it.

151
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,680
I'm not writing it.

152
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,240
Fine.

153
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,320
You're too good at writing.

154
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,840
You can't make up for it.

155
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,960
Tell me.

156
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,840
What kind of rabbit's handwriting do you want?

157
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,400
I'll teach you.

158
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,200
I want to write...

159
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,720
What is love?

160
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,640
You got it, right?

161
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,280
What's wrong?

162
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,480
Lord Jing doesn't know this poem?

163
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,680
What's this?

164
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,520
Good flooded.

165
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,320
Conf quarter,

00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,240

167
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,600
UT equivalent of 168.

168
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,020
Looking for S豆 蜂

The first day.

174
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
The first day.

175
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,480
The first day.

176
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,480
The first day.

177
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,480
Be careful.

178
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,480
Why is it so slow in here?

179
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,480
I'll be hungry when I go out.

180
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
The first day.

181
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
Xiao Yan Zi just left.

182
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,480
I have to keep an eye on this fool.

183
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
Don't let him ruin the key plot of the sister-sister meeting.

184
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,480
It's weird.

185
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,480
Why is there no one?

186
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,480
Oh no.

187
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,480
Did it get exposed?

188
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,480
Oh no.

189
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,480
You sneaked into my room at midnight.

190
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,480
It's a good plan.

191
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,480
What else can I do?

192
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,480
How can you be so frivolous as a woman?

193
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,480
Xiao Yan Zi, you have to try harder.

194
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,480
You're a man.

195
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,480
