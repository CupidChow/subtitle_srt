5
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,600
The doctor said

6
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,400
Ziwei just fainted

7
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,680
and was badly injured.

8
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,580
I have some medicine here.

9
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,720
I'll do it.

10
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,040
Who knows if you have poison or not.

11
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
Lian'er, give it to me.

12
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll tell you a secret.

13
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,840
You'll believe me if you hear it.

14
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,120
I know

15
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,800
Ziwei is the real brother.

16
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,280
You're not.

17
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,680
You're afraid of deceiving the emperor.

18
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,560
So you didn't

19
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,840
give him your identity.

20
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,760
Lian'er said

21
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,080
she heard it when I was in a coma.

22
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,680
She didn't tell the empress

23
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,960
about such a fatal secret.

24
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,400
She didn't tell the empress.

25
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,520
I believe her, too.

26
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,360
I didn't tell her before.

27
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,720
I didn't tell her when she was in a coma.

28
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,040
I won't tell her in the future.

29
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,600
Although Ziwei suffered this time,

30
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,640
it also hurt the empress's pride.

31
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,520
It made the emperor feel more sorry for Ziwei.

32
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,960
This is

33
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,760
the only way to make Ziwei a good person.

34
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,520
Using Ziwei's injury to make the emperor feel sorry

35
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,920
is a good idea.

36
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,200
But I don't believe you're trying to hurt him.

37
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,360
Xiao Yanzi is a fake princess.

38
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,960
Ziwei is the emperor's daughter.

39
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,680
Erkang and the fifth prince are also involved.

40
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,480
How dare they!

41
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,680
Lian'er betrayed Ziwei on the surface.

42
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,240
But she kept such a big secret for them.

43
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,680
This matter is big.

44
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,600
We need to tell the empress

45
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,120
about the truth.

46
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,680
The empress will regard the Shufang House as her destiny.

47
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,360
If she tells the empress about this,

48
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:18,320
she will use this to

49
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,280
pull the Shufang House apart.

50
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,360
Then the fifth prince and Erkang can't escape.

51
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,160
And Lian'er.

52
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,080
The empress won't let her off.

53
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,160
Good.

54
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,640
Lian'er.

55
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,360
Father asked me and Ziwei to go to south of there with him.

56
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,600
But Ziwei's wound is not healed yet.

57
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,200
I don't know if she will get out of this actually.

58
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,160
If Zi Wei goes out with the princess,

59
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,120
she'll be safer than staying in the palace.

60
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,520
Right?

61
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,000
That makes sense.

62
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,680
There's the empress in the palace.

63
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,040
If Jingyuan hadn't helped Zhou Xuan,

64
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,760
Father would have helped her.

65
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:13,680
When we went to save Zi Wei,

66
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,200
the empress wouldn't have given up on us.

67
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,760
Li Er.

68
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,680
I, Xiao Yan Zi, have been through a lot.

69
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,680
I'm the most loyal.

70
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,080
I can't help but repay Jingyuan's kindness.

71
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,040
You're my good sister.

72
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,120
Help me repay Master Jing.

73
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,280
Huh?

74
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay.

75
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,480
She's preparing the materials?

76
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040
So quickly.

77
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,680
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,680
It's been days since I saw him.

79
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,040
I wonder what he's doing.

80
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,520
Miss Lin, stop.

81
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,600
Where are you going?

82
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,120
I'm going to send something to Lord Jing.

83
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,960
His Majesty is going to Jiangnan.

84
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,680
Lord Jing is in charge of the exploration.

85
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,200
He left the capital last night.

86
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,360
Didn't he tell you?

87
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,080
Lord Jing is going to Jiangnan too?

88
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,360
How come I don't know?

89
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,600
Miss Lin, please go back.

90
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:23,720
We have to go.

91
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,560
I'm sorry for the delay.

92
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,080
Did Her Majesty send him another mission?

93
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,640
This is the key plot of these couple of CPs in Jiangnan.

94
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,600
Why is Lord Jing going there too?

95
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,520
I finally made up my relationship.

96
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,360
Will there be any problem?

97
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,160
I have it.

98
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,880
Stop the carriage.

99
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:05,440
Stop the carriage.

100
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,120
Eat something and feed the horse.

101
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,600
Where are we?

102
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,320
How long will it take?

103
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,560
Is there anything else?

104
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,960
Eat water.

105
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,200
I yearned for you for so much.

106
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,560
Sit here, I'll be right back.

107
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,440
It's a little cold there.

108
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,120
I won't eat even if there is anything better for you.

109
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,160
Were they all water?

110
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,360
Here.

111
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,400
Your Highness.

112
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,040
This is for Lord Jing.

113
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,400
Don't have it.

114
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,720
It's almost dawn.

115
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,120
I'm sorry, Officer Jing.

116
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,320
Just one piece.

117
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,720
Just one piece.

118
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,520
The last piece.

119
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,120
The last piece.

120
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,320
The last piece.

121
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,320
The last piece.

122
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
The last piece.

123
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
The last piece.

124
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,720
Stop the car!

125
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,720
Sir, we're here.

126
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:49,920
It went well on the way.

127
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:50,720
Okay.

128
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,720
We've got all the supplies you ordered.

129
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,720
We're finally here.

130
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,880
This…

131
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,440
Sir, please spare us!

132
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,720
Be understands.

133
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,400
Your Highness.

134
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,160
Your Highness.

135
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,200
This is the dessert I prepared for you.

136
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
Please accept it.

137
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,360
I don't know what's in here.

138
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
I don't know what's in here.

139
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
I don't know what's in here.

140
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,360
I don't know what's in here.

141
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,360
I don't know what's in here.

142
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,440
I didn't know that

143
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,160
I would have to walk for so long.

144
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,840
I'm so hungry.

145
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,120
I was so careless that I...

146
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,400
No one...

147
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,280
The palace guards followed the wedding team.

148
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,960
How did you do it?

149
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,200
You made such a big mistake.

150
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,200
Report it to me now.

151
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,000
It's none of their business.

152
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I wanted to...

153
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,160
I wanted to follow them.

154
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,080
Lord Jing.

155
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,840
Don't you want to ask

156
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,400
why I risked my life to come here?

157
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:02,560
Tell me.

158
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:07,080
I don't know if you're doing well these days.

159
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,800
I can't sleep at night because of my sleep.

160
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,680
That's why I risked my life to come here.

161
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,840
Please take this sweet letter

162
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:21,680
for the sake of my sincerity.

163
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,440
Please leave me, okay?

164
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,480
Ma Zha, come with me.

165
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
Take her back to the capital.

166
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,280
Yes.

167
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,240
Xiao Yan Zi! Zi Wei!

168
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,160
Xiao Yan Zi!

169
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,960
You're here.

170
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,960
Zi Wei!

171
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,280
What's wrong?

172
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,240
What's wrong?

173
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,160
I came all the way here.

174
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,400
Lord Jing asked me to go back.

175
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,840
What should I do?

176
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,200
I've brought him some snacks.

177
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,840
He didn't appreciate it and he asked me to leave.

178
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,840
The jade armor is here.

179
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,480
How can I play with it?

180
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:00,880
It's okay.

181
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,760
Father has been very happy these days.

182
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
I'll go and tell him for you.

183
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:05,920
Let's go.

184
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:06,960
Let's go.

185
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,240
Kinda toy

186
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,020
Quite generally

187
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,180
But it's aessot

188
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:30,860
I'm sorry.

189
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:31,860
I didn't understand you properly.

190
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,040
Hua Chen Rui,

191
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,360
COLK

192
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,620
BOSS

193
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:46,400
Good evening.

194
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:47,860
May I ask

195
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,000
if you team-up with medical staff

196
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,920
in Dchin Ker 덕省湊岙國

197
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,360
The sky is clear, the outer world is empty

198
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,920
This time you said you missed me

199
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,280
The color of the wind is not moving

200
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,800
The flower will be fine if you pick it up

201
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,400
The red flowers are all over the desert

202
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,920
The full moon is not ripe

203
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,800
The cold frost is like a cold frost

204
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,440
The heart is like a fire

205
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,240
The heart is like a fire

206
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,040
The heart is like a fire

207
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,320
The secret of the sky is like a wind

208
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,920
I am so tender like a dagger

209
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,600
Always be my love

210
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,000
Can't hide your clues

211
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,760
Always be my love

212
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,840
We can't hold on anymore

213
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:28,720
If love is enough

214
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,320
Miss it

215
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,680
Just let it go

216
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,600
For you, the most romantic movie

217
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,520
In memory

218
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:36,480
You are the answer

219
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,400
You are the destiny of my life

220
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,320
The time you gave me

221
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,640
Not enough to tell you it's me

222
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,640
Let the longing become a river

223
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,880
The color of the wind is not moving

224
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,960
The flower will be fine if you pick it up

225
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,880
The red flowers are all over the desert

226
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,320
The full moon is not ripe

227
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,920
The heart is like a fire

228
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,360
The heart is like a fire

229
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,960
The heart is like a fire

230
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,480
The heart is like a fire

231
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,520
The heart is like a fire

232
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,120
The heart is like a fire

233
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,600
If love is enough

234
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,120
The future is different

235
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,760
This time you said you missed me
