1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Long Ballad

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The Long Ballad

3
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The Long Ballad

4
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The Long Ballad

5
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Xiao Yanzi is rough and cunning.

6
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm afraid it's not enough for just a child.

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What do you mean?

8
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
A child is a good boy.

9
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
He is young and promising.

10
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Lord Jing is the bloodline of the Ula-Nara clan.

11
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
He is perfect match for Xiao Yanzi.

12
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
When Xiao Yanzi becomes your daughter-in-law,

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
you can squeeze her into the well in the future.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
If this child can be a mother,

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I can also give my sister an explanation.

16
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Yes, Your Highness.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
If you succeed,

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
it will be more messy.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
No.

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Lord Jing is mine.

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Mine?

22
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The Life-Saving Talisman?

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I can't let him destroy the CPs of Xiao Yanzi and the Fifth Prince.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Touch it.

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
No.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
No.

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Princess Huan Zhu.

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Bye.

30
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Here you are.

31
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Thank you.

32
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
So, is it okay?

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
What does it mean?

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It means oh.

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Okay.

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I like it.

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Try it.

38
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
How is it?

39
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
It's delicious.

40
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Okay.

41
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Very okay.

42
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Okay.

43
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I've never had such delicious food outside the palace.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
This.

45
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Is there a name for it?

46
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Sorry, Xiao Yanzi.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm too rude to you.

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
I'm so embarrassed.

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I have an idea.

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
It's called

51
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The Real Milk of the Lin Family.

52
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
The Real Milk of the Lin Family?

53
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Anyway,

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I finally got rid of this Nanny Rong.

55
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Brother,

56
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Nanny Rong is strict,

57
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
but she is an old lady in the palace.

58
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You can learn from her.

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I can.

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Can I change a person?

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Nanny Rong will scare people to death.

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
How about this?

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll learn from Consort Ling.

64
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
She is kind and kind.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I like her.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Prince V.

67
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
How about Prince V?

68
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You learn from Prince V?

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I said

70
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
you should let Prince V teach you.

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
How about it?

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Prince V?

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He hit me with a sword.

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I didn't give him a good lesson.

75
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He was being polite.

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
That's just a beautiful misunderstanding.

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Look at Prince V.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
He is the favorite prince of His Majesty.

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
His Majesty is so wise.

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
His Majesty likes him.

81
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Can't he be bad?

82
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
What?

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You're talking to me?

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Why are you staring at Lord Jing?

85
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I sprained my neck

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
when I fell.

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I can't turn.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Let me help you.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
No need.

90
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Thank you.

91
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Princess.

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Her Highness asked me to

93
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
write you a few books

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
that are easy to understand.

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Let you read them first.

96
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
There are many things

97
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
to learn when you just arrived in the palace.

98
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You need to learn them.

99
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You need to learn the basics.

100
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Lord Jing is so considerate.

101
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I don't know how to write.

102
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I believe that

103
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
as long as you study hard

104
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and have a good time,

105
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
you will have a good result.

106
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Of course I can help you.

107
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
The nickname of Lord Jing

108
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
is King of Flame.

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
King of Flame?

110
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
When I was in the changing room,

111
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I saw him

112
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
kill an old lady

113
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
in the battlefield.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Kill in the battlefield?

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
There is a family in the northern suburbs.

116
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
My daughter doesn't want to enter the palace.

117
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
But her father is too greedy

118
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
to let her go.

119
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So he forced her to enter the palace.

120
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
She entered the palace for three years.

121
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Three months ago,

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
she was eaten by the old lady.

123
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
In the end, she was in a bad mood

124
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
and committed suicide.

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Princess.

126
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Do you think

127
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
she died of injustice

128
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
or not?

129
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Not unjust.

130
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
She deserves to die.

131
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It seems that the palace is peaceful.

132
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
But it's not.

133
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Princess.

134
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
You are new here.

135
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
You should be careful.

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Don't be blinded

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
by some bad people.

138
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Okay.

139
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's my fortune

140
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
to be able to

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
make friends with Lord Jing.

142
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Don't worry, Lord Jing.

143
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I'll listen to you.

144
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I will study hard.

145
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Okay.

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I'm leaving now.

147
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Don't worry.

148
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,160
His Majesty

149
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
doesn't want him to die.

150
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
He's already a child.

151
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
His Majesty

152
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
will be at his trick общ.

153
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
He will not be be a child.

154
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
His Majesty

155
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
has always been a child shaped little boy.

156
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Returning to my father,

157
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
all parents

158
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,800
You have to pay more attention to him.

159
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
What is he writing?

160
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,600
A letter?

161
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,880
Who is he writing to?

162
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,840
Is it Xiao Yan Zi?

163
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
Yes.

164
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,160
You are the first one

165
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,160
who dares to escape from my window.

166
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,080
Go back.

168
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,120
You have no power to escape.

169
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,560
Why are you reaching out?

170
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,400
I...

171
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,800
I need to talk to you.

172
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,040
Come in.

173
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,560
You...

174
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I...

175
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,720
I must catch you today

176
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,520
and make you pay for it.

177
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,880
It's late at night.

178
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
I'm alone.

179
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,040
Just tell me what you want.

180
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,240
What?

181
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,880
Are you scared?

182
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,000
I won't...

183
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Eat you up.

184
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You are reading my letter?

185
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,640
Are you...

186
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,440
Let's see how I expose you.

187
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,600
I'm here to borrow your book.

188
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,240
That one.

189
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,120
You are a maid.

190
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,120
What are you studying?

191
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,360
Ice-sword?

192
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
You are so good.

193
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,200
When I was little,

194
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,600
my father's favorite book

195
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
was the Ice-sword of Sun Zi.

196
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,400
But he hadn't finished teaching me yet.

197
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
He just gave it back to me.

198
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
My father too.

199
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,840
If you like this book,

200
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,560
I'll lend it to you.

201
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
What did you say?

202
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I said,

203
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:27,400
don't ask me anything you shouldn't.

204
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
This note

205
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,800
must be prepared for Xue.

206
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,600
It's for Princess Huan Zhu, right?

207
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,400
It has nothing to do with you.

208
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
It has nothing to do with you.

209
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Everyone in the palace knows that

210
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
you and I are in love.

211
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,200
If you can't get along with Princess Huan Zhu,

212
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,000
you'll be

213
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,800
a love-hate couple.

214
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
So,

215
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,400
I'll help you

216
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
with this note.

217
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,600
Then,

218
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,400
you won't be in love with me.

219
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,400
I'm leaving.

220
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Wait.

221
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,800
Go to the front door.

222
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,400
It's a secret.

223
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:43,400
You're so humiliating!

224
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,400
Sir,

225
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,800
why are you angry?

226
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,200
The king drew it so well.

227
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,200
Look.

228
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
Brother.

229
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
Xiao Yan Zi,

230
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,600
you can't draw on the note.

231
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,800
Admit your mistake to Mr. Ji.

232
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,200
I didn't draw this.

233
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,000
I got it from Mr. Jin.

234
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,400
I didn't even open it.

235
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,600
I must make the plot back to normal.

236
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I'm sorry, Xiao Yan Zi.

237
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,600
Please be sorry.

238
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I believe that the fifth prince will be happy.

239
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,600
He'll help you.

240
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,400
Princess Huan Zhu is so naughty.

241
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,000
She's going to punish her with three-character crystal.

242
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
100 times.

243
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,200
100 times?

244
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,200
I...

245
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,400
100 times.

246
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,400
Mr. Ji,

247
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,000
Xiao Yan Zi is injured.

248
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,400
I'm willing to punish her.

249
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,200
Look how nice the fifth prince is to you.

250
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,800
He's not like Jing Yuan.

251
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,400
He even made you get punished and scolded.

252
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,800
Right?

253
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,600
Whoever is framing Princess Huan Zhu,

254
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,200
will know who did it.

255
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,600
You're so mean.

256
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Sir.

257
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
Usually,

258
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,600
the common model of the Imperial Household Department

259
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,800
used by princes and princesses

260
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,800
is high quality,

261
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,200
especially the one for calligraphy.

262
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,000
I'm usually busy with work.

263
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,200
I use the calligraphy model of Song Yan.

264
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,200
The one who draws the turtle

265
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,800
uses the most common model in the palace.

266
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,400
Someone is framing Princess Huan Zhu

267
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,400
using Jing Yuan's model.

268
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,800
Right.

269
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,200
Who is he?

270
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,200
And what is his motive?

271
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
It's me.

272
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,800
Sir.

273
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,200
I drew the turtle.

274
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,200
I admit it.

275
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
No.

276
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,800
No.

277
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,800
No.

278
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
No.
