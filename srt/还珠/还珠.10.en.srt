The Legend of Chusen

00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:09,460
Episode 15

5
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,200
Tasting it is the diamond ring.

6
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,100
Pardon, senior cop.

7
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:24,220
If you ask, screen chce

8
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,400
and show yourself.

9
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,920
The mistress is lying.

10
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,440
Let go of me.

11
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,920
You heard

12
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,320
what I said to Nanny Rong?

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:57,800
Jingyuan,

14
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,360
I...

15
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,040
Everyone in the palace wants to live.

16
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,280
Everyone wants to live.

17
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,080
But if you want to live for yourself,

18
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,480
you push the other innocent person out and die,

19
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:11,560
then...

20
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,720
Ershuang,

21
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,520
I'll tell everyone the secrets of the House of Shu.

22
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,240
Jingyuan,

23
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,800
please spare my life.

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,400
His Majesty has taken care of Ziwei

25
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,320
and wants to take her as his concubine.

26
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,440
You should recuperate first.

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,720
Jingyuan!

28
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:38,920
Jingyuan!

29
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,640
Nanny Rong has taken Ziwei away.

30
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,120
She asked us to ask you

31
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,240
what happened.

32
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,840
Jingyuan,

33
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,360
this is Kunning Palace.

34
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,720
It's not a place for you sisters to fight.

35
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,560
She framed Ziwei.

36
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,680
You still want to help her?

37
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,600
I didn't help her.

38
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,680
I don't understand her either.

39
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,160
It seems that Ziwei

40
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,960
has been framed and has recovered.

41
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,200
I did it for the sake of my life.

42
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,520
Don't blame me.

43
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,080
Ziwei didn't do anything wrong.

44
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,000
Of course she won't be punished.

45
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,360
What do you mean by that?

46
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,240
You...

47
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,320
You traitor!

48
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,240
Ziwei is so weak.

49
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,960
She's locked up in Nanny Rong's little dark room.

50
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,480
How can she stand it?

51
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,840
You're a person who betrays your sister

52
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,480
for your own sake.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,040
I, Xiao Yanzi,

54
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,000
don't have friends like you.

55
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,160
From now on,

56
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,080
you're no longer my friend.

57
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:45,920
I...

58
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,880
I'm Lin'er from Kunning Palace.

59
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,760
I have something to report to Consort Ling.

60
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,960
Please tell her for me.

61
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,960
Nanny Rong.

62
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,280
It's the fault of Princess Ziwei of Shufang House.

63
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,920
Princess Ziwei has always been

64
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,440
under His Majesty's watch.

65
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,200
I'm sorry.

66
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,880
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,680
I'm sorry.

68
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,400
I'm sorry.

69
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,040
I'm sorry.

70
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,680
I'm sorry.

71
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,320
I'm sorry.

72
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,960
I'm sorry.

73
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,680
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,440
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,080
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:19,840
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,680
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,440
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,080
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,680
He's telling the truth.

81
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,040
Pull it.

82
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,200
Off you are.

83
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,600
Stop.

84
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,560
My...

85
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,480
I, Huang Shulan, will defeat you.

86
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,480
I will be good to you.

87
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,480
If you want to save Ziwei, you have to rely on me.

88
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,480
Lord Fu!

89
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,480
Lord Fu!

90
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,480
Brother, Consort Ling is waiting for us.

91
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Prince V, please return.

92
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,480
His Majesty has rested.

93
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,480
Prince V! Prince V!

94
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,480
Prince V!

95
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,480
You...

96
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
Xiao Yan Zi.

97
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,480
Why are you here?

98
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,480
I...

99
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,480
I forgot.

100
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,480
You are the Empress's dog.

101
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,480
Tell me, where is Zi Wei?

102
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,480
I came to save Zi Wei too.

103
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,480
But I didn't find her.

104
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,480
You liar!

105
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,480
I... Xiao Yan Zi, where are you going?

106
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,480
I'm going to save Zi Wei.

107
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,480
Even if I destroy Kun Ning Palace today, I will save her.

108
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,280
What will you use to save Zi Wei?

109
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,080
Will you rely on your skills or your armory?

110
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,080
This is Kun Ning Palace, which is heavily guarded.

111
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Episode 2

112
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,880
Why is it my business to save Zi Wei?

113
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,280
It's none of your business.

114
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,480
Zi Wei is in danger right now.

115
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,480
It's not the time for you to get angry.

116
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,280
Xiao Yan Zi.

117
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,480
What should I do for you to cooperate with me?

118
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,480
Then...

119
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,480
I swear to you.

120
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,080
If I don't really want to save Zi Wei,

121
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,080
I will be in a big trouble.

122
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,080
I will send 300 such poison poems every day.

123
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,080
That's you.

124
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,080
Then I will tell you a secret.

125
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
You will believe me if you hear it.

126
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,480
I know.

127
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,080
Another secret.

128
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,080
Who is it?

129
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,080
Tell me.

130
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,680
Where did the Empress hide Zi Wei?

131
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,080
It's none of your business.

132
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,680
Get out.

133
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,480
Tell me where Zi Wei is. I want to save her.

134
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,280
I said get out!

135
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,880
Get out!

136
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,480
Get out!

137
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,680
Get out!

138
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,480
Get out!

139
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,480
Let me go!

140
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,480
If I want to hurt Zi Wei,

141
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,880
why do I have to suffer?

142
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,280
You just need to tell me where she is.

143
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,480
I will prove it to you all.

144
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,480
I can't help you.

145
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,200
What are you doing?

146
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:26,960
Stop pretending.

147
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,720
You can't help me.

148
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,400
You have to save her yourself.

149
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,000
I know what you're thinking.

150
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,280
If you don't go,

151
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,280
Prince V and Er Kang will do it.

152
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,160
When the empress asks,

153
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,920
more people will be involved.

154
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,520
Even if you succeed,

155
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,200
the empress will suspect you.

156
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:44,560
Because only you know

157
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,480
where Zi Wei is.

158
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,560
I'm responsible for my own loss.

159
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:50,840
It has nothing to do with you.

160
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,040
I'm involved.

161
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:07,800
Your Grace.

162
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,440
The empress is asleep.

163
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,640
If there's anything,

164
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,760
report it tomorrow.

165
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,560
You can find a way to stall Granny Rong.

166
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:15,840
Granny Rong?

167
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,320
Help us to get the time to save Zi Wei.

168
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:18,960
Your Grace.

169
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,040
In this way,

170
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,320
you won't be suspected.

171
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,000
Zi Wei can be less tortured.

172
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,320
I have something important to report to you.

173
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,120
It's about His Majesty.

174
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,040
I'm afraid it'll be too late

175
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,840
after tonight.

176
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,400
Fine.

177
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,760
Follow me.

178
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,000
Xia Jiangnan. Xia Jiangnan. Xia Jiangnan.

179
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
As an emperor,

180
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
you didn't allow me to run outside

181
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
in the capital.

182
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,000
But you're hiding it from me.

183
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,480
Please calm down, Your Grace.

184
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,560
His Majesty is afraid that you'll be angry,

185
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,760
so he's hiding it from you.

186
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,200
Jingyuan.

187
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,080
Yes.

188
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,320
You followed the emperor to Xia Jiangnan.

189
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,480
You're afraid that

190
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,760
His Majesty will suspect you.

191
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,120
I'm afraid that

192
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,200
His Majesty will suspect you.

193
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,440
I'm afraid that

194
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,560
His Majesty will suspect you.

195
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,880
Tell Sheng Jia to go to Jiangnan

196
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,200
and keep an eye on His Majesty for me.

197
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,040
In case he makes a mistake again,

198
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:14,840
he'll get some

199
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,280
cat-like princesses and princes back.

200
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:19,440
Yes.

201
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,160
Tonight, it's my turn to dress up as Nanny Li.

202
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,520
I can't let Nanny Rong

203
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,040
be the most beautiful.

204
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,280
Tell me.

205
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,680
Who taught you

206
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,520
to get married into the palace?

207
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,040
What's your motive?

208
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,920
No one taught me.

209
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,480
And I have no motive.

210
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,080
Even if you starve me to death

211
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,120
and beat me to death,

212
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,920
I have nothing to say to you.

213
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,480
Cut the crap.

214
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,360
Tell me.

215
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,480
Tell me.

216
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,080
Ziwei.

217
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,280
Old woman.

218
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,440
I'll make you stronger.

219
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,040
Ziwei.

220
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,600
Let's go.

221
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,440
Let's go out first.

222
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:01,960
Are you okay?

223
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,200
Ziwei.

224
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,280
Let's go.

225
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,160
Li'er.

226
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,480
You're injured.

227
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:06,960
Let me do it.

228
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,920
Cut the crap.

229
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,520
Let's go.

230
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,640
Let's go.

231
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,480
Be careful.

232
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,520
My mother never gives up.

233
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,360
She's as strong as ice.

234
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,120
Her heart is flaring.

235
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:40,880
Her rope is strong.

236
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,680
Her body is weak.

237
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,960
The secret of the sky and the wind

238
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,560
is so tender that it's like a dagger.

239
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,280
Always be my love.

240
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:49,560
I can't hide from your clues.

241
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,400
Always be my love.

242
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,520
We can never be together again.

243
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,440
If love is a long-lasting love,

244
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,960
if we miss it,

245
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,440
let's just say goodbye.

246
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,320
I'll make you the most romantic movie

247
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,200
and play it in my memory.

248
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,440
The courage I have for you

249
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,040
is my destiny.

250
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,040
I don't have enough time to tell you

251
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,160
that I'm the one who makes you miss me.

252
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:20,920
Oh.

253
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:21,520
Oh.

254
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,040
The color of the night is so beautiful.

255
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,520
The flowers are so beautiful.

256
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,560
The flowers are so beautiful.

257
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,760
The moon is so beautiful.

258
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,040
Like a flower,

259
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,960
the moon is so beautiful.

260
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,960
The sky is so clear.

261
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,200
That the storm said my prince was the king.

262
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,040
How quite it is to crush a diamond

263
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,120
and see the modulus of the moon in my dream.

264
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,300
I don't want to

265
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,200
hide from your restauranteur.

266
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,620
These books are my favorite.

267
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,600
They go so well with wine and wine wine.

268
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,520
Does it matter how well they infuse wine with wine?

269
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,320
Luckily, I'm in a poor state today.

270
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,640
Don't bother my guests.

271
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,140
My friend Xiaflan

272
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,320
said that

273
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,160
waistband as well as detailed以及
