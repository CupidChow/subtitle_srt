China)

2
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:40,576
They're sending 500 Tokarevs

3
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,577
to North Korea.

4
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,912
Tokarevs?

5
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,498
Confirm it.

6
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,423
I understand.

7
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:56,217
Lock it down at once.

8
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,260
Yes, sir.

9
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,056
Do you know who I am?

10
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,058
Give me my phone!

11
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,434
One call from me,

12
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,936
and you'll...

13
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,229
Shut up!

14
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,149
The party knows all about it.

15
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,568
Those guns...

16
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,028
were to be scrapped.

17
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,363
What's the big deal?

18
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,992
North Korea has never
requested them.

19
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,577
That can't be!

20
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:49,747
Where are the guns now?

21
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,916
It's being transported
to South Korea.

22
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:54,752
I didn't know!

23
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,088
I thought they were bound
for the North!

24
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,381
Anyway,

25
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:00,675
I'll clean it up!

26
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,010
Release me!

27
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,557
What are you doing?

28
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,356
I'll take my team
and clean it up in South Korea.

29
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,903
You're certain you can be covert
while carrying out this mission

30
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,490
with your entire team there?

31
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,492
What if you get caught?

32
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,703
How should we do this, then?

33
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,585
Send this one over alone.

34
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,673
But she's just a trainee.

35
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,051
She'll be up against
an arms dealer.

36
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,429
I know!

37
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,765
That's why I'm sending her.

38
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,059
Sending her to die?

39
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,226

41
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,315

the South Korean government..."

45
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,033
"do in the meantime?"

46
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,284
We can respond as such.

47
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:09,702
Dismissed!

48
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,913
Sir.

49
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,503
What if...

50
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:22,507
she accomplishes her mission?

51
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:26,594
If she is that talented,

52
00:06:26,678 --> 00:06:27,845
we'll groom her.

53
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,057
But don't expect much.

54
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,560
Her mission is...

55
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:38,106
to go and die.

Huh?

61
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:29,032
I was going to get some shut-eye.

62
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,659
What brings you here?

63
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,996
Sit down.

64
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,666
Want something to drink?

65
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,335
No. I stopped by for a sec.

66
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,222
We switched hospitals.

67
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,100
But I got a call from the old one.

68
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,311
They said someone paid the bill.

69
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:04,108
You don't need to give this back.

70
00:08:04,359 --> 00:08:06,361
I paid for it
because I'm doing well.

71
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:09,364
I'm super busy lately.

72
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,242

73
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,453
You were in?

74
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,790
The lights were out earlier.

75
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,166
Yes, sir.

76
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,378
Mr. Woo, it's getting out of hand.

77
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,463
The rent wasn't
deposited yesterday.

78
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:29,092
Do I always have to come here
to collect the rent?

79
00:08:30,093 --> 00:08:31,052
That's not possible.

80
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,262
Of course it's possible!

81
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:37,183
I know you laid off your staff
and are having a tough time...

82
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,895
Oh! I deposited a check.

83
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:44,440
You know the bank takes a few days

84
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,566
to get that processed.

85
00:08:46,985 --> 00:08:47,902
All right.

86
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:51,072
I can check it
with the bank tomorrow.

117
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,303
Anyway, what's up?

118
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,681
I have an unofficial favor to ask.

119
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:29,272
That's quite serious.

120
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:30,732
Will you help?

121
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:35,028
You may be asking too much.

122
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,447

bad side.

to come to our temp office.

It's an earpod.

last time,

00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,619
This isn't
an assassination mission.

190
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:54,912
I just need to gather some intel

191
00:15:54,996 --> 00:15:56,623
and let the police take over.

192
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:57,790
Assassination?

193
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,002
- Here's the advance.
- There's a misunderstanding...

194
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,048
Misunderstanding?

195
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,885
It's nothing.

196
00:16:09,636 --> 00:16:12,180
I'm not someone who doesn't work

197
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,349
without a full payment up front...

198
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,352
Oh...

199
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,021
Then can I pay
10,000 dollars in halves?

200
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,358
No, these are heavy.

201
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:24,692
I'll take them.

202
00:16:24,776 --> 00:16:27,362
- They're not heavy at all.
- No, it's okay!

203
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,621
Your name is Woo Su-han?

204
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,747
Yes.

205
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:41,042
I need to look like I work here,

206
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,210
so can I call you "boss"?

207
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,379
That's a bit much...

208
00:16:45,088 --> 00:16:47,215
"Chief" would be more appropriate.

209
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,676
Okay, Chief.

210
00:16:50,385 --> 00:16:51,678
What's your name?

211
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:52,929
Yoo Da-hee, sir.

212
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,848
You can speak comfortably.

213
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:56,933
I'm your employee after all.

214
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,768
Okay, Da-hee.

215
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:03,398
I didn't hear about
what my role is exactly.

216
00:17:03,648 --> 00:17:04,607
I see.

217
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,402
Where's the briefing room?

218
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:09,362
Briefing room...

219
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:10,655
There!

220
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,285
You want me to brief you
with that?

221
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,244
Why not?

222
00:17:16,327 --> 00:17:18,246
Security isn't guaranteed here.

223
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,248
It's all good.
Barely anyone comes by.

224
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,722
Can I throw these out?

225
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,015
What?

226
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:39,475
No!

227
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,810
Holy cow...

228
00:17:45,315 --> 00:17:47,233
I waited a long time
to get this autograph.

229
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,527
Got a new one?

230
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,029
Give it to me. Hold on.

231
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,035
You're into that?

232
00:17:58,578 --> 00:18:01,414
No, it's a piece of evidence
I collected.

233
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,207
Don't worry about it.

234
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:11,549
(SI Chemical Park Du-sik)

235
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,384
This man is our target.

236
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:14,761
SI Chemical imports

237
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,929
rare-earth elements from China.

238
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:21,893
Mr. Woo.

239
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,645
You didn't deposit any checks!

240
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:24,687
Here's the rent for three months.

241
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:26,981
Three months?

242
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,193
Okay, thank you.

243
00:18:30,276 --> 00:18:31,235
Sorry about that.

244
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,404
- Take care, sir.
- Yeah, sure.

245
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,032
Continue.

246
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:41,579
This place is not secured.

247
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:42,997
He's just a landlord.

248
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:44,374
This doesn't make sense to him.

249
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:50,964
Who did I say this guy was?

250
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,593
What was it?
He imports rare items.

251
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:56,719
Rare items?

252
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:59,889
Shrimps, lobsters,
stuff like that.

253
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,557
It's rare-earth elements.

254
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,518
You only got "rare" right.

255
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:07,271
Anyway, a few days ago,
they smuggled...

256
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:14,654
Welcome, how can I help you?

257
00:19:14,737 --> 00:19:17,031
My baby disappeared...

258
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,992
Is that right?
Please sit down.

259
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:25,748
What are you doing?

260
00:19:25,832 --> 00:19:27,917
(I will not steal
instant coffee again.)

261
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:31,879
Uh, she has sticky fingers...

262
00:19:32,547 --> 00:19:35,508
Ms. Kim, it's wrong to steal.

263
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,803
Ms. Kim, bring us
two cups of coffee.

264
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,306
Iced coffee for me.

265
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:43,266
Me too, with tons of syrup.

266
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,144
Chief.

267
00:19:48,646 --> 00:19:49,814
Where's coffee?

268
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:51,190
Go buy some.

269
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,868
What is the name of your child?

270
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,370
- Dorothy.
- Do-what?

271
00:20:04,454 --> 00:20:06,539
It's an English name, Dorothy.

272
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,125
- Korean-American?
- No, no.

273
00:20:12,253 --> 00:20:17,342
There are pet detectives
who specialize in these things...

274
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:20,470
I'll give you this.

275
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,016
We are the s-pet-cialist.

276
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:31,105
Please find her.

277
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:32,565
Don't worry about a thing.

278
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,617
We find dogs too?

279
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,494
We got retained.
We have to.

280
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,207
Can I continue?

281
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,249
Okay.

282
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,211
All right, so SI Chemical...

283
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,213
How many damn times!

284
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,929
Park smuggled 5,000 Tokarevs here

285
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:05,640
from China a few days ago.

286
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:09,018
Tokarev? TT-33?

287
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,479
- A pistol?
- Yes.

288
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:13,189
Investigating arms smuggling
by ourselves?

289
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,232
What about it?

290
00:21:14,315 --> 00:21:16,067
A case of this scale

291
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,485
should be done by the cops!

292
00:21:17,568 --> 00:21:18,695
But the cops only get involved

293
00:21:18,778 --> 00:21:20,530
when there is evidence.

294
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:22,240
So she's not a cop...

295
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:24,742
There is no evidence,
so we're getting involved!

296
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:26,703
NIS? DSC?

297
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:29,163
No wonder they pay so much...

298
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:30,581
What's with him?

299
00:21:30,665 --> 00:21:32,417
Will he backstab me?

300
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,461
If things go sour, I'll bail.

301
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,215
Is there a problem?

302
00:21:40,258 --> 00:21:41,217
Nope.

303
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:46,889
Park attends a tango cafe
in Gangnam every night.

304
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,683
I'll dance with him

305
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:49,934
and swipe his phone.

306
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:52,478
I'll hand it over to you,
and you clone it.

307
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:53,521
Okay.

308
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,982
Do you know how to clone a phone?

309
00:21:56,065 --> 00:21:58,484
Of course! It's just illegal.

310
00:21:58,568 --> 00:22:01,654
Well, what we do is illegal.

311
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,656
That sounds right.

312
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,700
But do you know how to tango?

313
00:22:06,492 --> 00:22:09,370
Yes, I learned the basics.

314
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,372
Then I'll see you...

315
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:17,253
at the tango cafe tomorrow.

316
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:20,423
Don't forget the dress.

317
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:21,841
Dress?

318
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:23,885
That's a given.

319
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,803
Do I need to wear it
to a practice session?

320
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:28,473
Do you not wear a swimsuit
when swimming?

321
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:30,683
Oh...

322
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:35,396
Breathe out.

323
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:40,276
One, two, three...

324
00:22:46,366 --> 00:22:47,659
Can I help you?

325
00:22:48,868 --> 00:22:49,953
I want to learn the tango...

326
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:51,120
Oh...

327
00:22:51,537 --> 00:22:55,375
We do yoga first
then the tango lesson after.

328
00:22:57,043 --> 00:23:00,088
And you can wear something comfy.

329
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:02,590
Dresses are only for competitions.

330
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:07,095
I knew it...

331
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:10,098
Do you have anything
to change into?

332
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:14,060
- Da-hee?
- Yes?

333
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:17,939
- Don't fart on me.
- Shut the hell up!

334
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:34,539
- Hola!
- Hola!

335
00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:37,375
- Am I late?
- No, we just started.

336
00:23:44,841 --> 00:23:46,968
We are incredible together.

337
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:49,846
- Sure.
- Good.

338
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:55,727
Wait...

339
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,988
Your dress is spectacular.

340
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:31,638
Emergency...

341
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:42,398
What the, a flip phone?

342
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:47,070
Come on...

343
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:50,615
(Sent:
Mr. Jeon, you're not reachable.)

344
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:51,699
(If you don't answer by today,)

345
00:24:51,783 --> 00:24:53,159
(I'll call the police.)

346
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:05,838
My apologies.

347
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:36,619
Oh, my!

348
00:25:37,704 --> 00:25:38,871
Are you okay?

349
00:25:39,122 --> 00:25:40,290
Are you okay, Mr. Park?

350
00:25:42,417 --> 00:25:43,668
I'm fine...

351
00:25:47,005 --> 00:25:48,339
Yeah, I'm at the cafe.

352
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:53,636
What? What do you mean?

353
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:58,891
What were you doing?

354
00:26:15,450 --> 00:26:16,576
Mr. Park!

355
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:19,746
Ms. Lee, please help!

356
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:27,920
911? Please send help.
A man collapsed.

357
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,051
He's already dead.
We need to go.

358
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,053
Why should we?

359
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,055
Things will get messy
when the police arrive.

360
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:39,891
No, we'll look suspicious
if we leave now.

361
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,893
You sure this is okay?

362
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:44,228
We didn't do anything.

363
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:45,146
Don't worry about it.

364
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:52,820
So... do you two know each other?

365
00:26:52,904 --> 00:26:53,863
- Yes.
- No.

366
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:58,201
So do you know each other or not?

367
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:01,245
We didn't know each other,

368
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,581
but we got acquainted today,

369
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,124
so we do now.

370
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:07,835
So you don't.

371
00:27:08,753 --> 00:27:10,588
- Mr. Woo Su-han?
- Yes?

372
00:27:10,672 --> 00:27:12,048
You run
a private detective agency?

373
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:14,008
- Yes.
- Were you at the tango cafe

374
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:15,134
to investigate someone?

375
00:27:15,343 --> 00:27:18,429
No, it's my hobby, to learn it.

376
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,473
Hobby...

377
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:23,267
- And Ms. Yoo Da-hee.
- Yes?

378
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:26,354
It was your first
tango session today?

379
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:27,605
Yes.

380
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,858
But you two are all dressed up...

381
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,403
Right? Awkward, no?

382
00:27:33,653 --> 00:27:34,988
Why is she all dressed up

383
00:27:35,071 --> 00:27:36,781
for her first session?

384
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,574
With gloves too!

385
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,620
At least take your bow tie off!

386
00:27:46,541 --> 00:27:49,168
But why are we
getting investigated?

387
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:52,255
Because people thought
you two looked suspicious.

388
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:54,173
- Who?
- Everyone.

389
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:57,802
But that doesn't mean
we're charged with a crime.

390
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:02,598
Right, and his cause of death
was a heart attack too.

391
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:05,518
- So can we leave?
- Yes.

392
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:06,811
Thank you!

393
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:17,196
Sir, aren't they a bit fishy?

394
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,616
You don't have the experience
to feel that way.

395
00:28:19,699 --> 00:28:21,993
If you become like me,
you'll develop intuition.

396
00:28:22,076 --> 00:28:24,287
Look into those two further.

397
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,622
Sir? Why?

398
00:28:25,705 --> 00:28:28,166
They've got something.
I'm getting tingly.

399
00:28:31,544 --> 00:28:33,588
So our work's done?

400
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:34,631
How so?

401
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:36,257
The target is dead.

402
00:28:36,341 --> 00:28:39,886
Park must've been used
and killed afterwards.

403
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:41,304
Come on, you heard him.

404
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:42,680
It was a heart attack.

405
00:28:43,056 --> 00:28:45,099
High doses of potassium chloride

406
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:47,602
could induce it without a trace.

407
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:49,604
You didn't know that?

408
00:28:50,688 --> 00:28:52,357
Of course I knew that.

409
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,109
It means
professionals got involved.

410
00:28:55,193 --> 00:28:59,072
So we should report this
and take a step back.

411
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:01,032
Step back from what?

412
00:29:01,115 --> 00:29:03,451
If you don't want the job,
return the advance.

413
00:29:04,118 --> 00:29:06,788
I was just testing your tenacity.

414
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:07,872
Like hell you were.

415
00:29:07,956 --> 00:29:09,165
Keep those words to yourself.

416
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,124
I can hear them.

417
00:29:10,208 --> 00:29:12,502
Oh, yeah, did you clone the phone?

418
00:29:15,672 --> 00:29:18,716
It... was a flip phone.

419
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,718
So? You couldn't?

420
00:29:20,802 --> 00:29:22,136
It had the wrong plug!

421
00:29:22,470 --> 00:29:24,722
And you never said
it was going to be a flip phone!

422
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:26,224
Everyone uses smartphones now.

423
00:29:26,307 --> 00:29:28,142
What about the call logs?

424
00:29:28,226 --> 00:29:29,394
I saw them.

425
00:29:29,727 --> 00:29:33,106
He texted someone called
"Mr. Jeon" recently.

426
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:34,357
He was going to call the cops

427
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,400
if Jeon didn't answer by today.

428
00:29:36,109 --> 00:29:37,610
Did you memorize the number?

429
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,280
You didn't?

430
00:29:40,905 --> 00:29:42,407
They all use burner phones.

431
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,284
Why bother memorizing it?

432
00:29:44,492 --> 00:29:45,952
Arms dealers must use burners.

433
00:29:46,035 --> 00:29:46,911
Why would he use his own?

434
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:49,455
So what the hell did we do today?

435
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:55,378
By the way,
where should I drop you off?

436
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,588
In front of the station.

437
00:29:57,672 --> 00:29:58,965
- Which station?
- Daerim.

438
00:29:59,299 --> 00:30:00,258
That's too far!

439
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:01,676
Why did you ask, then?

440
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:03,720
I thought you'd say,
"The closest subway station"!

441
00:30:03,803 --> 00:30:05,596
How could I
hop on a subway in this?

442
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,265
So why did you dress like that?

443
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:10,184
I dressed like this
because of someone!

444
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:15,315
It's about the agent
I'm working with.

445
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,442
I don't think he's an agent.

446
00:30:17,734 --> 00:30:19,694
That's his talent.

447
00:30:19,777 --> 00:30:21,404
No one knew he was an agent.

448
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:24,657
His codename is Ama Zing
for a reason.

449
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,243
I understand.

450
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:41,507
So he had no ID or anything
to identify him?

451
00:30:41,591 --> 00:30:43,468
No, he had nothing,

452
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:45,511
and his phone had no records.

453
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:47,764
By the way,

454
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:50,433
I think I saw him recently.

455
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:51,726
Where?

456
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:53,686
On YouTube.

457
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,855
He was on a kiss cam with a guy

458
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:58,775
and was outed as gay
at a baseball game.

459
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:02,111
It went viral online.

460
00:31:02,195 --> 00:31:05,239
So he attempted suicide

461
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:08,117
by running into traffic?

462
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:10,161
That sounds plausible.

463
00:31:10,662 --> 00:31:12,747
That's not right...

464
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:19,837
I'm going to save this man
no matter what.

465
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:22,256
Hang in there.

466
00:31:24,592 --> 00:31:26,260
Why are you late?

467
00:31:27,762 --> 00:31:29,055
Working, obviously.

468
00:31:31,349 --> 00:31:32,850
(Lost Puppy)

469
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:35,228
We have to do this too?

470
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:37,563
We got paid, so yeah.

471
00:31:38,731 --> 00:31:40,191
- All right.
- Why are you here?

472
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:41,818
I thought we were done.

473
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:46,739
You didn't see the news?

474
00:31:49,033 --> 00:31:51,119
The Rodeo clan's boss was
shot to death.

475
00:31:51,619 --> 00:31:52,912
Last night.

476
00:31:58,042 --> 00:31:59,419
Sir!

477
00:31:59,502 --> 00:32:00,461
Get him!

478
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:03,840
Then what?

479
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:06,551
Guns are already on the streets?

480
00:32:06,634 --> 00:32:08,928
That's what we have to find out.

481
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:13,099
Do you know anyone
who's connected to that world?

482
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:14,100
"That world"?

483
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:15,852
Yeah, mobs and gangs.

484
00:32:15,935 --> 00:32:18,271
How would I know that?
I'm not a cop.

485
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:23,151
If you don't feel like working,
cough up the advance.

486
00:32:23,901 --> 00:32:25,695
I know an expert in that world.

487
00:32:25,778 --> 00:32:27,196
Then let's go!

488
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,157
It costs money. That's why.

489
00:32:30,283 --> 00:32:31,242
How much?

490
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:33,328
2,000 dollars.

491
00:32:39,792 --> 00:32:40,752
Here.

492
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,005
You sure about this?

493
00:32:44,464 --> 00:32:47,216
Totally sure.
He's like a fortune-teller.

494
00:32:50,553 --> 00:32:52,180
It's been so long.

495
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:53,848
Yup.

496
00:32:54,766 --> 00:32:57,435
We actually came
to a real fortune-teller?

497
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,396
He's famous among gangsters.

498
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,898
He's an insider.

499
00:33:02,774 --> 00:33:05,026
What brings you here today?

500
00:33:05,318 --> 00:33:07,362
Your sexual compatibility?

501
00:33:07,445 --> 00:33:08,404
- No!
- No!

502
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:10,031
You sure?

503
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:11,699
You two will create

504
00:33:11,783 --> 00:33:13,284
a whirlwind.

505
00:33:13,368 --> 00:33:14,494
Forget that.

506
00:33:14,994 --> 00:33:17,789
Did you hear anything
about the Rodeo clan lately?

507
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,791
Why do you ask such a thing?

508
00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:25,380
That's only 1,950 dollars.

509
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:31,094
Here it is.

510
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:34,764
He's so good.
He knew it right away.

511
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:38,017
You little monkey.

512
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:45,400
The Rodeo clan's boss dropped in
out of the blue to ask me

513
00:33:45,692 --> 00:33:47,610
whether he was destined
to die with a bullet.

514
00:33:48,653 --> 00:33:49,612
What did you tell him?

515
00:33:50,113 --> 00:33:52,407
I told him
that would never happen.

516
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,659
The chance of someone
getting shot in Korea is

517
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:58,496
about the same as
getting hit by lightning.

518
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,040
That's common sense.

519
00:34:03,835 --> 00:34:05,628
Oh, no, no, no!

520
00:34:05,712 --> 00:34:07,255
Holy cow! I'm so done for!

521
00:34:07,338 --> 00:34:10,508
Did you hear anything else?

522
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,594
Whether the Rodeo clan was
trying to acquire guns?

523
00:34:13,678 --> 00:34:15,638
That would never happen!

524
00:34:16,264 --> 00:34:18,975
Rodeo has a firm grasp of Gangnam.

525
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:22,270
Why would they intentionally
get on the cops' radar?

526
00:34:23,688 --> 00:34:27,317
They can leak intel
on their rivals

527
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,527
and use the cops
to their advantage.

528
00:34:29,611 --> 00:34:31,070
Messing up your rivals legally is

529
00:34:31,154 --> 00:34:33,031
the best way!

530
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:34,782
He's right!

531
00:34:34,866 --> 00:34:36,951
There's no need for turf wars.

532
00:34:37,035 --> 00:34:40,413
There aren't any gang wars
in Korea!

533
00:34:40,496 --> 00:34:41,497
Except one.

534
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:44,334
The Ax clan.

535
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:45,835
Ax clan?

536
00:34:47,295 --> 00:34:50,298
They're a vicious clan,
unlike other gangs.

537
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:53,801
They went head to head
with a Chinese gang two years ago,

538
00:34:53,885 --> 00:34:56,262
and they completely took over.

539
00:34:57,555 --> 00:35:00,642
For them, anything is possible.

540
00:35:00,725 --> 00:35:02,185
Yup.

541
00:35:02,268 --> 00:35:03,936
Bring it, bring it.

542
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,271
I'm so thirsty.

543
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:15,156
Why is this so sour?

544
00:35:15,907 --> 00:35:18,117
This drink is expired!

545
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:21,454
Kiddo, the juice is expired.

546
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:22,956
Throw them out, all right?

547
00:35:26,668 --> 00:35:28,878
We'd better look into the Ax clan.

548
00:35:29,462 --> 00:35:30,421
Ax clan?

549
00:35:31,255 --> 00:35:33,633
The smugglers may start a gang war

550
00:35:33,716 --> 00:35:35,259
in order to sell guns.

551
00:35:35,802 --> 00:35:37,679
If Rodeo doesn't budge,

552
00:35:37,762 --> 00:35:39,430
they'll agitate the Ax clan.

553
00:35:39,514 --> 00:35:41,724
Are you nuts?
You heard him!

554
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:43,518
He said they're vicious!

555
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:45,728
You sure are a chicken
for a seasoned expert.

556
00:35:45,812 --> 00:35:47,647
I don't believe it.

557
00:35:48,022 --> 00:35:49,565
It's not that I'm a chicken.

558
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:51,818
I'm just not a fan of having

559
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:53,194
an amateur like you tagging along.

560
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:56,447
Don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

561
00:35:56,531 --> 00:35:59,158
Did you learn diet boxing
or something?

562
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:00,410
Diet boxing?

563
00:36:02,954 --> 00:36:03,955
Should I show you?

564
00:36:04,038 --> 00:36:06,749
Jeez, all right, show me.

565
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:09,294
If I hit you,
we're going to the Ax clan.

566
00:36:09,377 --> 00:36:11,004
Fine, go ahead.

567
00:36:11,296 --> 00:36:14,048
The ring and the street
are completely diff...

568
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:25,059
You wanted me to hit you.

569
00:36:26,269 --> 00:36:27,353
I let you hit me.

570
00:36:30,189 --> 00:36:31,441
Any blood stains?

571
00:36:37,113 --> 00:36:38,448
We're from Major Crimes.

572
00:36:47,206 --> 00:36:50,293
I already talked
to the cops earlier.

573
00:36:50,376 --> 00:36:51,586
That it wasn't us.

574
00:36:51,669 --> 00:36:53,838
Did an arms dealer
come by recently?

575
00:36:54,297 --> 00:36:55,298
Nope.

576
00:36:56,507 --> 00:36:58,176
We've arrested that dealer.

577
00:37:01,179 --> 00:37:04,182
Why don't you go ask him, then?

578
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:06,517
If you're uncooperative,

579
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:07,977
we will arrest you.

580
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:11,648
Do you have an arrest warrant?

581
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:13,232
Gang violence falls
under a special law,

582
00:37:13,316 --> 00:37:14,359
so it doesn't need one.

583
00:37:14,442 --> 00:37:15,443
Didn't know.

584
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:17,904
I've had it. Cuff him.

585
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:18,947
We'll interrogate him
at the station.

586
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:20,448
Cuff him?

587
00:37:20,823 --> 00:37:22,992
- Yes, handcuffs.
- I don't have one.

588
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:29,415
Where's your head at?

589
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:30,750
How could you not bring a pair?

590
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:43,638
What's this?

591
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:47,100
Suspects complained that handcuffs
were hurting their wrists,

592
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:49,352
so we're testing this new pair.

593
00:37:49,435 --> 00:37:51,312
The world has improved, no?

594
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:53,314
Protecting civil rights
of criminals too.

595
00:37:54,983 --> 00:37:56,317
Shouldn't you read me

596
00:37:56,401 --> 00:37:58,861
the Miranda warning first?

597
00:37:59,153 --> 00:38:00,196
Miranda warning?

598
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,364
Isn't that for a medical school?

599
00:38:01,447 --> 00:38:03,658
That's the Hippocratic Oath.

600
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:07,829
Right, Miranda warning, I know.

601
00:38:08,871 --> 00:38:10,748
You have the right
to appoint a prosecutor.

602
00:38:10,999 --> 00:38:12,500
- Lawyer.
- I know.

603
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:14,961
What are you doing?

604
00:38:15,044 --> 00:38:17,213
You two aren't cops, right?

605
00:38:17,297 --> 00:38:18,589
- No.
- Yes.

606
00:38:46,242 --> 00:38:47,201
Hurry!

607
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:48,369
Let's go!

608
00:38:50,038 --> 00:38:51,789
- Chief?
- Yes?

609
00:39:01,049 --> 00:39:02,175
- Da-hee...
- Yes?

610
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:04,886
- You go ahead...
- How could I leave you?

611
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:07,388
I'm okay. You go on...

612
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:13,311
What the heck?

613
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:17,440
Isn't that your nosebleed
from earlier?

614
00:39:17,523 --> 00:39:18,483
What?

615
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:21,736
Dammit!

616
00:39:22,654 --> 00:39:23,738
Crap...

617
00:39:32,747 --> 00:39:34,082
What took you so long?

618
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:35,166
Shut up!

619
00:39:36,751 --> 00:39:38,044
Very good.

620
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:55,228
These guys really are insane.

621
00:39:55,311 --> 00:39:57,313
How could they
wield guns in Korea?

622
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:58,731
I almost died back there.

623
00:39:58,815 --> 00:39:59,899
Do you know any hackers?

624
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:01,818
Hackers? What for?

625
00:40:01,901 --> 00:40:03,194
We have to unlock this.

626
00:40:03,528 --> 00:40:04,988
No need to unlock it.

627
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:06,322
We don't need it anymore.

628
00:40:06,406 --> 00:40:07,490
What are you talking about?

629
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:10,034
You may not have noticed,

630
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:12,704
but those guys are pros.

631
00:40:14,038 --> 00:40:15,164
I noticed.

632
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:20,044
They double-tapped
and used the Mozambique Drill

633
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:22,297
and had silencers
and subsonic ammo.

634
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:25,216
They have to be
experienced mercenaries.

635
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,926
Then call in the reinforcement!

636
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:28,428
No! I have to do this alone!

637
00:40:28,511 --> 00:40:29,470
Why?

638
00:40:30,305 --> 00:40:32,307
We just have to do it ourselves.

639
00:40:33,558 --> 00:40:35,768
If not, cough up the advance.

640
00:40:35,852 --> 00:40:39,480
I'm sick of it.
I'll cough it all up!

641
00:40:39,689 --> 00:40:41,107
Minus the 50 percent retainer,

642
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:43,026
expenses, labor costs,
and hazard pay,

643
00:40:43,109 --> 00:40:44,110
I'll return 2,000 dollars, happy?

644
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:46,321
So are you gonna
pay it back or not?

645
00:40:46,404 --> 00:40:48,489
I did some work.
I need to get paid too.

646
00:40:48,573 --> 00:40:50,867
Anyway, I'm out of this gig,
so you're on your own.

647
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:56,247
I'll pay 10,000 more
after the job.

648
00:40:57,874 --> 00:40:59,626
So you need a hacker?

649
00:40:59,917 --> 00:41:01,085
I knew it.

650
00:41:01,794 --> 00:41:04,172
It costs money. That's all.

651
00:41:04,255 --> 00:41:05,465
How much?

652
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:06,591
About 3,000.

653
00:41:06,674 --> 00:41:07,634
3...

654
00:41:12,889 --> 00:41:15,099
And don't skimp 50 dollars
like before.

655
00:41:15,183 --> 00:41:17,018
That was so embarrassing.

656
00:41:17,268 --> 00:41:21,606
That was an honest mistake.

657
00:41:27,403 --> 00:41:28,404
Are you in business?

658
00:41:30,031 --> 00:41:33,409
Hold on, hold on,
I can't save here.

659
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:39,499
I saw "You Died"
so many times today.

660
00:41:39,707 --> 00:41:41,292
Yoo Da-hee?
You two know each other?

661
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,335
Say what?

662
00:41:47,298 --> 00:41:49,258
When did you get that?

663
00:41:49,759 --> 00:41:52,095
There was a showcase recently.

664
00:41:52,178 --> 00:41:53,888
Hey, could I take one?

665
00:41:53,972 --> 00:41:55,098
Hell no.

666
00:41:55,181 --> 00:41:56,849
I gave you a concert ticket
last time.

667
00:41:57,058 --> 00:41:58,393
Oh, yeah...

668
00:41:59,143 --> 00:42:01,020
- Okay, take one.
- Dope!

669
00:42:04,315 --> 00:42:05,650
I'm gonna take this one too.

670
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:08,820
No, not Seulgi.
What a rogue!

671
00:42:08,903 --> 00:42:09,988
You're into Yeri.

672
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:11,698
I'll give you hers when I get it.

673
00:42:12,282 --> 00:42:14,117
- You promise?
- Absolutely.

674
00:42:14,909 --> 00:42:16,828
Are you serious?

675
00:42:17,036 --> 00:42:18,329
Aren't we here on business?

676
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:23,251
Could you unlock this?

677
00:42:26,504 --> 00:42:27,672
Payment up front.

678
00:42:27,755 --> 00:42:28,965
Of course.

679
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:31,926
Here.

680
00:42:32,302 --> 00:42:34,304
No need to check between us.

681
00:42:35,263 --> 00:42:36,723
Why bother checking?

682
00:42:40,727 --> 00:42:41,978
It's 50 dollars short.

683
00:42:42,061 --> 00:42:43,021
What?

684
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,775
That's weird.

685
00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:50,361
A bill keeps slipping out.

686
00:42:52,238 --> 00:42:53,281
So embarrassing...

687
00:42:53,364 --> 00:42:55,158
It really slipped.

688
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:00,663
Any keywords to look for?

689
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,459
"Tokarev" or "arms dealer,"
and things like that.

690
00:43:08,338 --> 00:43:11,466
What about this? "Broker"?

691
00:43:11,549 --> 00:43:12,675
When was the call made?

692
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:14,552
It was... three days ago.

693
00:43:14,802 --> 00:43:16,929
Can you check
who owns that number?

694
00:43:17,555 --> 00:43:19,057
I sure can. One sec.

695
00:43:21,893 --> 00:43:23,561
If the owner made online purchases

696
00:43:23,645 --> 00:43:26,230
with this phone,

697
00:43:26,314 --> 00:43:27,231
we can get an address too.

698
00:43:27,315 --> 00:43:28,441
Give me a sec.

699
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:31,653
It's Seoul.

700
00:43:31,736 --> 00:43:33,863
I'll text you the address.

701
00:43:34,238 --> 00:43:35,198
Okay.

702
00:43:35,615 --> 00:43:36,574
Let's go.

703
00:43:36,783 --> 00:43:38,534
- Go now?
- Yup.

704
00:43:38,952 --> 00:43:40,411
Could I use your restroom?

705
00:43:40,495 --> 00:43:43,081
- Where is it?
- You can't...

706
00:43:43,331 --> 00:43:45,249
It's clogged up,
so I poured the drain cleaner...

707
00:43:50,421 --> 00:43:52,799
Could you go any faster?

708
00:43:53,007 --> 00:43:54,801
- Why?
- Step on it!

709
00:43:54,884 --> 00:43:56,344
I can't!

710
00:43:57,011 --> 00:43:59,806
The city speed limit is
60km per hour.

711
00:44:00,014 --> 00:44:02,141
I hate breaking laws.

712
00:44:03,101 --> 00:44:04,102
What's with you?

713
00:44:04,394 --> 00:44:06,312
I drank expired juice!

714
00:44:07,522 --> 00:44:08,731
I didn't drink any.

715
00:44:09,857 --> 00:44:12,110
Can't you install a GPS?

716
00:44:12,610 --> 00:44:13,861
Ex-Special Forces memorize

717
00:44:13,945 --> 00:44:16,322
the map instantly.

718
00:44:16,406 --> 00:44:18,533
I've memorized every
highway code in Korea.

719
00:44:18,825 --> 00:44:21,244
I don't need a GPS.

720
00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:22,996
Damn it...

721
00:44:23,079 --> 00:44:24,038
D-1?

722
00:44:24,122 --> 00:44:24,998
Highway D-1 goes

723
00:44:25,081 --> 00:44:27,458
from Jindo to Gurye.

724
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:30,378
Jesus Christ...

725
00:44:30,628 --> 00:44:31,713
JC-8?

726
00:44:31,796 --> 00:44:33,214
A Jincheon interchange

727
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:35,758
into the national highway.

728
00:44:40,221 --> 00:44:41,472
Go left!

729
00:44:41,556 --> 00:44:42,515
(Sinsa Station, Busan)

730
00:44:49,689 --> 00:44:51,566
Oh, man...

731
00:44:56,112 --> 00:44:57,071
Dammit...

732
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,698
Maybe no one's home.
Let's leave.

733
00:44:58,781 --> 00:44:59,991
Go where?

734
00:45:06,122 --> 00:45:07,457
It's locked again.

735
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,499
Anyone home?

736
00:45:09,083 --> 00:45:10,209
No one's here.

737
00:45:10,293 --> 00:45:12,462
Move. I'll open it for you.

738
00:45:13,004 --> 00:45:14,505
Piss off!

739
00:45:24,599 --> 00:45:27,810
Red flavor
I'm curious, honey

740
00:45:27,894 --> 00:45:30,563
(Olympus Business)

741
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:38,571
Wow, Chief!

742
00:45:38,655 --> 00:45:39,989
Is this your new car?

743
00:45:40,406 --> 00:45:41,366
It sure is.

744
00:45:41,741 --> 00:45:43,284
It's like a supercar.

745
00:45:43,368 --> 00:45:45,078
Don't touch it. You'll smudge...

746
00:45:45,536 --> 00:45:47,455
Already got
your fingerprints on it.

747
00:45:47,956 --> 00:45:49,415
What's the situation inside?

748
00:45:49,624 --> 00:45:52,669
Gunshots everywhere.
It's chaos.

749
00:45:53,503 --> 00:45:54,629
Chief.

750
00:45:54,712 --> 00:45:56,589
Did you find anything?

751
00:45:57,423 --> 00:45:58,758
I've got something to show you.

752
00:45:59,092 --> 00:46:00,051
Yeah?

753
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:02,762
This is outside the club
just before the shootout.

754
00:46:02,845 --> 00:46:04,681
These two.

755
00:46:04,764 --> 00:46:06,641
Don't they look like
the tango couple?

756
00:46:06,724 --> 00:46:08,142
I told you.

757
00:46:08,518 --> 00:46:10,103
There's something about them.

758
00:46:28,204 --> 00:46:30,164
Did she clog it?

759
00:46:32,125 --> 00:46:33,543
This was disguised as a suicide.

760
00:46:34,252 --> 00:46:36,004
No signs of struggle.

761
00:46:36,087 --> 00:46:37,255
This was done by pros.

762
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:40,925
What have you been eating?

763
00:46:41,801 --> 00:46:43,428
It's the stench
from the body rotting.

764
00:46:43,511 --> 00:46:44,929
What did you eat to make

765
00:46:45,013 --> 00:46:46,597
your poop smell
like a rotting body?

766
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:48,850
Like hell.
It's from this body right here!

767
00:46:48,933 --> 00:46:50,059
He didn't die a long time ago.

768
00:46:50,143 --> 00:46:52,020
He can't smell that bad.

769
00:46:55,690 --> 00:46:58,151
Look at the blisters
by his bellybutton.

770
00:46:58,234 --> 00:46:59,986
It's been at least three days.

771
00:47:00,069 --> 00:47:02,071
- Don't you know that?
- I know that!

772
00:47:04,324 --> 00:47:06,367
Something's blocking
on the other side.

773
00:47:06,576 --> 00:47:07,577
Move aside.

774
00:47:20,006 --> 00:47:21,090
See that?

775
00:47:21,174 --> 00:47:22,300
Watch and learn.

776
00:47:22,383 --> 00:47:24,677
This is from years of...

777
00:47:25,094 --> 00:47:26,846
experience...

778
00:47:27,805 --> 00:47:29,974
Kim Yeong-gu, Head of Security.

779
00:47:31,267 --> 00:47:33,227
Mugwang International.

780
00:47:39,317 --> 00:47:41,027
It's an arms broker.

781
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:44,405
Is there a list of executives?

782
00:47:44,697 --> 00:47:45,907
Let me look.

783
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,286
Yes, Director Jeon Hoon.

784
00:47:50,370 --> 00:47:51,537
Director Jeon Hoon?

785
00:47:51,829 --> 00:47:55,166
Director Jeon!
Park threatened him with a text.

786
00:47:55,249 --> 00:47:56,584
So that's the guy.

787
00:47:57,502 --> 00:47:58,920
There's a high chance of that.

788
00:47:59,128 --> 00:48:00,964
Not just a chance.
It's definitely him.

789
00:48:02,215 --> 00:48:05,635
There's a celebration
at Alvin Hotel tomorrow.

790
00:48:07,595 --> 00:48:10,056
What celebration?

791
00:48:10,306 --> 00:48:11,849
They've invited overseas adoptees.

792
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,935
- So go there tomorrow?
- Of course.

793
00:48:15,228 --> 00:48:17,397
Cloning Jeon's phone
would be best.

794
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,356
No,

795
00:48:18,439 --> 00:48:20,692
there's no time to steal
and return his phone.

796
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:22,777
Too dangerous. Next plan.

797
00:48:24,028 --> 00:48:27,031
What about luring him
with my femininity?

798
00:48:27,115 --> 00:48:28,157
Too dangerous. Next plan.

799
00:48:28,908 --> 00:48:29,951
Why not?

800
00:48:30,034 --> 00:48:32,203
That plan only works
for real hotties.

801
00:48:32,287 --> 00:48:34,372
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

802
00:48:34,872 --> 00:48:36,624
When I'm dolled up,

803
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:40,086
all the girls look like squids
in comparison.

804
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:42,880
A plate of sausage, please.

805
00:49:00,565 --> 00:49:02,734
I ordered too much.
Please have some.

806
00:49:03,318 --> 00:49:04,277
Sure.

807
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:09,407
You see that?

808
00:49:09,782 --> 00:49:11,909
A femininity plan is
used by those girls.

809
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:14,912
It's not like I want to do it!

810
00:49:15,163 --> 00:49:16,080
Got anything else?

811
00:49:16,164 --> 00:49:18,041
Attaching a bug on Jeon, then.

812
00:49:18,124 --> 00:49:19,125
You do it.

813
00:49:21,419 --> 00:49:23,921
Don't forget to wear a dress.

814
00:49:24,172 --> 00:49:25,465
A dress again?

815
00:49:25,548 --> 00:49:26,841
It's a celebration.

816
00:49:26,924 --> 00:49:28,343
We gotta look the part.

817
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:31,179
Don't wear something stupid.

818
00:49:31,262 --> 00:49:32,513
Look who's talking.

819
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,350
(Undercover name: Yoo Da-hee,
Real name: Wong Iring)

820
00:49:35,433 --> 00:49:36,601
Name, Wong Iring.

821
00:49:36,809 --> 00:49:39,103
She currently goes by Yoo Da-hee.

822
00:49:39,187 --> 00:49:42,190
She grew up in Korea,
so her Korean is excellent.

823
00:49:43,149 --> 00:49:44,692
She studied psychology
at Beijing University

824
00:49:44,776 --> 00:49:46,736
and has been working for the MSS

825
00:49:46,819 --> 00:49:47,779
for about three years now.

826
00:49:48,321 --> 00:49:49,405
Very good.

827
00:49:51,491 --> 00:49:53,534
As expected, they sent a rookie.

828
00:49:53,826 --> 00:49:54,994
They'll sacrifice a young elite

829
00:49:55,078 --> 00:49:56,162
and blame us for it.

830
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:01,334
Did the agent beside her
report back?

831
00:50:01,709 --> 00:50:02,794
No, not yet, sir.

832
00:50:03,086 --> 00:50:05,964
I made contact
and sent him a sign,

833
00:50:06,047 --> 00:50:07,256
but nothing yet.

834
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:10,134
Make contact properly
and request a situation report.

835
00:50:11,511 --> 00:50:12,595
But I...

836
00:50:14,597 --> 00:50:15,807
don't recognize him.

837
00:50:18,476 --> 00:50:19,852
He's not one of our agents?

838
00:50:21,270 --> 00:50:22,271
Um...

839
00:50:22,355 --> 00:50:24,190
(Doe Du-ho)

840
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:28,903
You're not as good as last time.

841
00:50:28,987 --> 00:50:30,697
That was just a warm-up.

842
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:35,702
Du-ho, isn't your mom coming soon?

843
00:50:35,785 --> 00:50:37,745
No, she'll be late today.

844
00:50:37,829 --> 00:50:40,748
Yeah? Here we go.

845
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:43,334
Why didn't you swing?

846
00:50:43,543 --> 00:50:44,419
Mom...

847
00:50:44,502 --> 00:50:46,337
Du-ho! What are you doing?

848
00:50:48,298 --> 00:50:50,174
What if you get hurt?

849
00:50:50,258 --> 00:50:52,051
I won't.

850
00:50:55,096 --> 00:50:57,432
I got to meet my husband

851
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:00,101
and started a family
thanks to you.

852
00:51:00,518 --> 00:51:02,228
But please stay away now.

853
00:51:04,564 --> 00:51:06,190
If he finds out

854
00:51:06,274 --> 00:51:09,110
that you left his dad to die,

855
00:51:09,402 --> 00:51:11,154
he'll be torn apart.

856
00:51:12,614 --> 00:51:14,657
I hope to never see you again.

857
00:51:16,868 --> 00:51:18,745
How is he,

858
00:51:18,828 --> 00:51:20,663
by the way?

859
00:51:20,747 --> 00:51:22,665
He'll be fine after the surgery.

860
00:51:23,124 --> 00:51:24,125
Oh...

861
00:51:29,047 --> 00:51:30,214
Honey, let's go.

862
00:52:13,508 --> 00:52:15,051
Da-rong, that's cheating!

863
00:52:15,134 --> 00:52:17,011
You didn't say
it wasn't allowed, Yuri.

864
00:52:21,057 --> 00:52:23,935
Xiao-rong, go to the ER tomorrow.

865
00:52:25,144 --> 00:52:26,646
This is nothing at all.

866
00:52:26,896 --> 00:52:29,065
Be a pro about it.

867
00:52:29,148 --> 00:52:30,858
Get it treated so it won't affect
your performance.

868
00:52:30,942 --> 00:52:32,235
Yes, boss.

869
00:52:38,283 --> 00:52:39,158
(Police)

870
00:52:40,702 --> 00:52:42,036
How can I help you?

871
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,496
Salute. Good day, sir!

872
00:52:43,579 --> 00:52:45,498
Bud, it's been a few days
since I got this car.

873
00:52:45,581 --> 00:52:47,083
It's not a common car, you know.

874
00:52:47,166 --> 00:52:48,668
Can't you remember it?

875
00:52:48,751 --> 00:52:51,087
I will absolutely do so.
Take care, sir.

876
00:53:00,388 --> 00:53:01,973
Chief, good afternoon.

877
00:53:02,557 --> 00:53:04,100
- Afternoon.
- Sir.

878
00:53:04,183 --> 00:53:06,311
- Where are you off to?
- We've got a body.

879
00:53:07,895 --> 00:53:08,855
Yeah?

880
00:53:22,952 --> 00:53:24,704
Where did you rent
this high school uniform?

881
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:26,706
What do you know about fashion?

882
00:53:26,789 --> 00:53:28,791
This is a designer jacket!

883
00:53:29,375 --> 00:53:33,796
Handcrafted by an Italian artisan.

884
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:36,215
Designer plaid!

885
00:53:38,926 --> 00:53:41,262
They've got a designer tablecloth.
That's incredible.

886
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,475
You're embarrassing me.
Take that jacket off.

887
00:53:46,934 --> 00:53:48,811
Dammit, fine.
I'll take it off.

888
00:53:51,314 --> 00:53:52,273
Don't take it off!

889
00:53:52,607 --> 00:53:53,691
Why? You said to take it off.

890
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:55,276
That's even more embarrassing.

891
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:56,527
This isn't a meet-and-greet!

892
00:54:00,073 --> 00:54:01,908
Use this to cover it up.

893
00:54:05,495 --> 00:54:08,373
Nag, nag, nag...

894
00:54:09,499 --> 00:54:10,833
Happy?

895
00:54:10,917 --> 00:54:11,876
So tacky...

896
00:54:15,463 --> 00:54:16,673
Chicken skewers, yum.

897
00:54:17,256 --> 00:54:19,217
Did you report it?

898
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,802
Huh? Report what?

899
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:23,388
We found that body.
It should be reported.

900
00:54:23,471 --> 00:54:25,473
Oh, that. I did it in the morning.

901
00:54:26,975 --> 00:54:28,685
Not with your phone, I hope.

902
00:54:28,768 --> 00:54:29,978
You take me for a fool?

903
00:54:31,437 --> 00:54:33,523
I used a pay phone, duh.

904
00:54:33,773 --> 00:54:36,567
No one knows we were there.

905
00:54:37,944 --> 00:54:38,820
(National ID: Woo Su-han)

906
00:54:38,903 --> 00:54:40,405
Where did you find this?

907
00:54:40,488 --> 00:54:42,323
It was on the floor
by the bedroom door.

908
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:45,994
Are they Hansel and Gretel
or something?

909
00:54:46,661 --> 00:54:48,871
Bread crumbs are everywhere.

910
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:01,968
That's him.

911
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:05,972
Using your femininity plan

912
00:55:06,055 --> 00:55:08,016
would've bombed.

913
00:55:10,601 --> 00:55:12,103
Shut up and get up.

914
00:55:12,186 --> 00:55:13,146
Okay.

915
00:55:18,318 --> 00:55:21,237
So where did we get adopted to?

916
00:55:21,529 --> 00:55:23,615
- I can't speak English.
- So?

917
00:55:26,326 --> 00:55:27,702
Where are you from, please?

918
00:55:28,578 --> 00:55:29,537
Puerto Rico.

919
00:55:30,455 --> 00:55:31,748
Puerto Rico?

920
00:55:34,667 --> 00:55:35,960
My name is Jeon Hoon.

921
00:55:36,794 --> 00:55:39,255
My name is Carlos Pellisiano.

922
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:43,092
And you?

923
00:55:43,926 --> 00:55:45,428
Olga Pellisiano.

924
00:55:47,013 --> 00:55:48,473
I'm aware there's no case of

925
00:55:48,556 --> 00:55:50,350
Korean adoption
to Puerto Rico so far.

926
00:55:50,725 --> 00:55:53,186
Did you immigrate
after being adopted to the US?

927
00:55:54,896 --> 00:55:55,855
Yes!

928
00:55:56,856 --> 00:55:58,483
Oh, I see.

929
00:55:59,108 --> 00:56:02,236
They immigrated
after being adopted to the US.

930
00:56:03,404 --> 00:56:04,447
Have a nice day.

931
00:56:04,822 --> 00:56:06,449
Thank you, thank you.

932
00:56:17,001 --> 00:56:18,252
- Bye.
- Bye.

933
00:56:22,924 --> 00:56:24,217
What's with them?

934
00:56:24,968 --> 00:56:27,762
Bunch of crazies, so disgusting.

935
00:56:31,849 --> 00:56:33,184
You've got quick hands.

936
00:56:33,393 --> 00:56:34,477
Puerto Rico?

937
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,437
I sure can think on my feet.

938
00:56:36,521 --> 00:56:38,356
What an idiot...

939
00:56:38,439 --> 00:56:39,941
Puerto Rico!

940
00:56:50,743 --> 00:56:51,703
Boss.

941
00:56:56,165 --> 00:56:57,667
The Ax clan's here.

942
00:56:59,836 --> 00:57:01,796
- I'll see you again.
- Thank you.

943
00:57:04,424 --> 00:57:05,383
Yuri.

944
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,553
Da-rong, Xiao-rong.

945
00:57:18,313 --> 00:57:20,148
Don't I look so dope?

946
00:57:21,357 --> 00:57:22,900
Did you come here to dine?

947
00:57:47,342 --> 00:57:48,593
What's going on?

948
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,514
There must be a misunderstanding.

949
00:57:54,349 --> 00:57:55,308
Misunderstanding?

950
00:57:56,184 --> 00:57:59,270
You dying here is
a misunderstanding.

951
00:58:00,313 --> 00:58:01,522
Chop them down.

952
00:58:18,414 --> 00:58:20,583
Easy, let's all calm down!

953
00:58:21,876 --> 00:58:23,044
It's a misunderstanding.

954
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:26,506
There's no need to fight.

955
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:28,800
Think this through.

956
00:58:28,883 --> 00:58:31,386
Rage crimes are rampant now.

957
00:58:31,761 --> 00:58:35,515
Those not in gangs will
readily buy guns.

958
00:58:35,848 --> 00:58:37,976
So why would we intentionally
start a war?

959
00:58:38,434 --> 00:58:39,894
We'll only become
a target of an investigation.

960
00:58:52,699 --> 00:58:55,743
So who killed our don?

961
00:58:57,578 --> 00:58:59,998
Roman scholar Cicero said once,

962
00:59:00,623 --> 00:59:02,375
"To whom is it a benefit?"

963
00:59:02,625 --> 00:59:05,378
If Rodeo and Ax clans go to war,

964
00:59:05,461 --> 00:59:07,630
who will benefit from it?

965
00:59:08,047 --> 00:59:09,507
Gangbuk punks?

966
00:59:09,757 --> 00:59:10,925
Good.

967
00:59:11,217 --> 00:59:12,510
You know the answer.

968
00:59:12,844 --> 00:59:15,013
Sons of...

969
00:59:15,638 --> 00:59:17,849
How much are the guns?

970
00:59:18,308 --> 00:59:20,101
Depends on how many you order.

971
00:59:20,476 --> 00:59:22,562
- 100 units for now.
- Very well.

972
00:59:22,895 --> 00:59:24,772
As a gesture of condolence
to your don,

973
00:59:24,856 --> 00:59:26,399
I'll only accept 80 percent
of the price tag.

974
00:59:27,066 --> 00:59:29,902
- Where is it?
- The guns aren't here.

975
00:59:29,986 --> 00:59:30,987
I'll transfer them tonight.

976
00:59:31,487 --> 00:59:33,781
I'll notify you
of the time and address later.

977
00:59:44,334 --> 00:59:46,252
Stupid punks...

978
00:59:49,505 --> 00:59:51,507
Disgusting.

979
00:59:54,844 --> 00:59:56,679
The handoff is tonight.

980
01:00:00,892 --> 01:00:02,185
Are you listening?

981
01:00:02,894 --> 01:00:03,936
It's beef!

982
01:00:05,063 --> 01:00:06,731
Come on...

983
01:00:14,739 --> 01:00:16,240
- What's wrong?
- The guy who broke

984
01:00:16,324 --> 01:00:17,700
his nose yesterday is here.

985
01:00:18,159 --> 01:00:19,118
Which one?

986
01:00:19,369 --> 01:00:21,454
He's wearing the tablecloth.

987
01:00:22,455 --> 01:00:25,291
Oh, Puerto Rico.

988
01:00:25,959 --> 01:00:28,002
We're exposed.
We have to get out.

989
01:00:30,421 --> 01:00:32,840
We gotta leave.

990
01:00:33,383 --> 01:00:34,759
I didn't have my dessert yet.

991
01:00:34,842 --> 01:00:36,803
We're exposed!

992
01:00:37,303 --> 01:00:38,429
Exposed?

993
01:00:41,182 --> 01:00:43,184
- Hurry up!
- I hear you!

994
01:00:54,279 --> 01:00:55,989
- Come quietly.
- Okay!

995
01:00:58,116 --> 01:00:59,075
- Hey!
- How dare...

996
01:01:00,743 --> 01:01:03,079
Goddamn!

997
01:01:11,546 --> 01:01:12,505
You take him.

998
01:01:22,181 --> 01:01:23,266
Take this!

999
01:01:24,976 --> 01:01:28,396
You punk!
Put that down!

1000
01:01:29,105 --> 01:01:30,815
It's ho... cold... What?

1001
01:02:40,134 --> 01:02:41,260
Stay behind me.

1002
01:02:41,928 --> 01:02:42,887
I'll take care of them.

1003
01:02:52,605 --> 01:02:54,399
At least walk the walk.

1004
01:02:57,485 --> 01:02:59,112
- Dope Woo P.I. Agency?
- Yes?

1005
01:03:00,071 --> 01:03:01,572
Why are you here?

1006
01:03:01,823 --> 01:03:04,826
If I tell you the truth,
will you let me go?

1007
01:03:05,285 --> 01:03:06,369
Of course.

1008
01:03:09,831 --> 01:03:13,209
You know Head of Security
Kim Yeong-gu?

1009
01:03:14,627 --> 01:03:18,131
- Yes.
- She hired me to find him.

1010
01:03:19,716 --> 01:03:20,675
Why?

1011
01:03:23,303 --> 01:03:25,388
She's a gold digger.

1012
01:03:25,471 --> 01:03:27,098
She was going to scam him

1013
01:03:27,181 --> 01:03:28,808
but got scammed instead.

1014
01:03:30,059 --> 01:03:33,021
A double scam, can you believe it?

1015
01:03:33,104 --> 01:03:34,856
Her IQ must be pretty low.

1016
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:38,943
So you came here to meet Mr. Kim?

1017
01:03:39,027 --> 01:03:40,069
Yes, that's right.

1018
01:03:40,570 --> 01:03:43,114
Then why were you
at the Ax clan's HQ yesterday?

1019
01:03:43,197 --> 01:03:45,158
I was where yesterday?

1020
01:03:48,828 --> 01:03:52,665
You were at the scene
when the Ax clan don was shot.

1021
01:03:54,459 --> 01:03:58,338
That night club was
the Ax clan's HQ?

1022
01:03:58,630 --> 01:04:00,465
What happened was,

1023
01:04:00,548 --> 01:04:01,633
we went there

1024
01:04:01,716 --> 01:04:04,344
after seeing Kim's call log.

1025
01:04:04,552 --> 01:04:06,804
- You saw his call log?
- Yes.

1026
01:04:06,888 --> 01:04:08,097
So you hacked his phone?

1027
01:04:08,348 --> 01:04:10,975
Sure, that was a piece of cake.

1028
01:04:13,227 --> 01:04:16,814
Then you saw other stuff
on the phone?

1029
01:04:18,900 --> 01:04:20,526
No, not at all.

1030
01:04:21,486 --> 01:04:22,528
How could you not see it?

1031
01:04:22,612 --> 01:04:24,238
She saw everything.
She knows it all!

1032
01:04:26,115 --> 01:04:28,117
What do you mean?
We saw it together.

1033
01:04:28,201 --> 01:04:30,119
No! My eyes are bad.
I need glasses to see!

1034
01:04:30,203 --> 01:04:31,412
I've got distorted vision.

1035
01:04:31,663 --> 01:04:33,790
You scheming jerk!
I paid you so much!

1036
01:04:33,873 --> 01:04:35,917
Like a real gold digger.

1037
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,418
She's got a foul temper.

1038
01:04:37,502 --> 01:04:39,128
I'm doing this to make money,

1039
01:04:39,212 --> 01:04:40,630
but it's so stressful.

1040
01:04:40,713 --> 01:04:42,131
It's really hard!

1041
01:04:43,091 --> 01:04:44,384
So, Carlos...

1042
01:04:44,467 --> 01:04:46,844
I mean, Mr. Woo,

1043
01:04:46,928 --> 01:04:49,347
you don't know Mr. Kim at all?

1044
01:04:49,681 --> 01:04:51,015
That's correct.

1045
01:04:52,517 --> 01:04:56,062
You can ask the gold digger
for more detail.

1046
01:04:57,647 --> 01:04:58,815
May I leave now?

1047
01:04:59,607 --> 01:05:00,566
Great.

1048
01:05:01,442 --> 01:05:03,027
Thank you.

1049
01:05:10,660 --> 01:05:13,788
Could you do me a favor though?

1050
01:05:14,247 --> 01:05:16,332
If you do,
I'll let you both go.

1051
01:05:31,347 --> 01:05:32,807
See that police substation?

1052
01:05:34,851 --> 01:05:37,729
Go and kill
all the police officers there.

1053
01:05:41,691 --> 01:05:43,985
Kill the police officers?

1054
01:05:44,569 --> 01:05:45,945
Don't feel too bad.

1055
01:05:46,154 --> 01:05:47,905
They'll die in the line of duty,

1056
01:05:48,281 --> 01:05:50,575
and their families will
receive special pensions.

1057
01:05:52,910 --> 01:05:54,912
It wasn't a simple arms smuggling?

1058
01:05:54,996 --> 01:05:56,497
None of your business.

1059
01:05:56,831 --> 01:05:59,459
If you run off,

1060
01:05:59,542 --> 01:06:00,627
we will kill you.

1061
01:06:10,261 --> 01:06:12,305
If you want to live,
do as I say.

1062
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:23,608
Don't be scared.

1063
01:06:23,691 --> 01:06:25,234
You've got enough ammo.

1064
01:06:33,409 --> 01:06:34,369
Good.

1065
01:06:43,711 --> 01:06:45,129
Shots fired.
Suspect on the run.

1066
01:06:45,213 --> 01:06:46,297
Plate number 43J-6449!

1067
01:06:46,381 --> 01:06:48,675
Black K5.
I repeat, 43J-6449!

1068
01:07:09,195 --> 01:07:10,154
Can I help you?

1069
01:07:23,167 --> 01:07:24,168
Hands up!

1070
01:07:27,046 --> 01:07:28,131
Drop the gun!

1071
01:07:46,357 --> 01:07:47,317
Christ...

1072
01:07:48,318 --> 01:07:51,613
So you were helping an NIS agent

1073
01:07:51,696 --> 01:07:53,740
investigate arms trafficking,

1074
01:07:53,823 --> 01:07:55,658
and they captured the NIS agent?

1075
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:56,909
Yes.

1076
01:07:58,286 --> 01:07:59,579
That's huge.

1077
01:08:01,539 --> 01:08:04,709
Give her a call.
Put it on speaker.

1078
01:08:07,086 --> 01:08:08,546
She certainly can't answer.

1079
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:09,672
She's in captivity.

1080
01:08:10,340 --> 01:08:11,799
Just give it a try.

1081
01:08:11,883 --> 01:08:13,426
Just humor me.

1082
01:08:14,135 --> 01:08:15,386
You really don't get it.

1083
01:08:15,470 --> 01:08:16,929
She's captured.

1084
01:08:18,806 --> 01:08:19,724
Just watch.

1085
01:08:19,807 --> 01:08:20,767
(Yoo Da-hee)

1086
01:08:23,603 --> 01:08:25,188
- Huh?
- Hello?

1087
01:08:28,274 --> 01:08:30,652
Where are you? You okay?

1088
01:08:30,735 --> 01:08:32,111
Of course I'm okay.

1089
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:33,279
What's up?

1090
01:08:34,155 --> 01:08:36,282
You're captured!

1091
01:08:36,366 --> 01:08:38,660
What do you mean?
I'm on my way home.

1092
01:08:38,910 --> 01:08:39,786
What?

1093
01:08:39,869 --> 01:08:42,038
And don't call me anymore.

1094
01:08:42,121 --> 01:08:44,332
How many Yangpyeong soups
did we have already?

1095
01:08:44,666 --> 01:08:45,959
Six times. Six!

1096
01:08:46,334 --> 01:08:48,586
I said I prefer Guksu noodles,

1097
01:08:48,670 --> 01:08:49,629
but we never had it once!

1098
01:08:49,712 --> 01:08:51,172
What are you talking...

1099
01:08:51,255 --> 01:08:53,967
Forget it. Don't call me anymore.

1100
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:55,635
Yoo Da-hee, hey!

1101
01:08:55,718 --> 01:08:57,512
She answers just fine.

1102
01:08:57,595 --> 01:08:59,180
You can relax now.

1103
01:09:00,181 --> 01:09:01,891
NIS agent, huh?

1104
01:09:02,308 --> 01:09:03,726
Why would an NIS agent work

1105
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:05,603
with a private investigator?

1106
01:09:06,771 --> 01:09:08,982
Chief, we've got a visit
from the NIS.

1107
01:09:13,736 --> 01:09:14,696
NIS?

1108
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,996
Please excuse us.

1109
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:32,630
It's been a while, Sgt. Woo.

1110
01:09:34,007 --> 01:09:37,635
You headed up my rescue op
in Thailand.

1111
01:09:39,429 --> 01:09:40,471
Right...

1112
01:09:40,722 --> 01:09:43,474
I'm very regretful
about the accident

1113
01:09:45,018 --> 01:09:46,394
that took place.

1114
01:09:46,477 --> 01:09:50,148
An order, you mean.
Not an accident.

1115
01:09:53,568 --> 01:09:58,156
Are you here about that?

1116
01:09:58,239 --> 01:09:59,866
No, not at all.

1117
01:09:59,949 --> 01:10:01,909
I need to confirm a few things.

1118
01:10:03,786 --> 01:10:05,580
Is your name Woo Su-han?

1119
01:10:06,164 --> 01:10:08,082
- Yes.
- Were you dishonorably discharged

1120
01:10:08,166 --> 01:10:09,834
from Special Force 707?

1121
01:10:10,168 --> 01:10:11,127
Yes.

1122
01:10:12,211 --> 01:10:13,796
Do you know this woman?

1123
01:10:14,380 --> 01:10:15,923
Yes, Yoo Da-hee.

1124
01:10:16,633 --> 01:10:18,217
How did she identify herself as?

1125
01:10:18,301 --> 01:10:19,677
She didn't identify herself.

1126
01:10:20,011 --> 01:10:21,971
Where did you think she belonged?

1127
01:10:22,972 --> 01:10:24,223
She's not one of yours?

1128
01:10:24,849 --> 01:10:25,933
She's not our agent.

1129
01:10:26,184 --> 01:10:27,977
Then the Defense Security Command?

1130
01:10:28,061 --> 01:10:29,771
She's a Chinese MSS agent.

1131
01:10:31,189 --> 01:10:33,316
Chinese intelligence?

1132
01:10:34,692 --> 01:10:35,777
Why would a Chinese agent come

1133
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:37,987
to stop arms trafficking here?

1134
01:10:38,863 --> 01:10:39,948
So?

1135
01:10:40,823 --> 01:10:41,950
Over a 93 percent chance

1136
01:10:42,033 --> 01:10:43,743
that he's not lying.

1137
01:10:45,954 --> 01:10:46,955
I see.

1138
01:10:48,164 --> 01:10:49,248
Very well.

1139
01:10:49,332 --> 01:10:52,001
Although you've assisted
a foreign intelligence agent,

1140
01:10:52,085 --> 01:10:55,046
you have not caused any harm
to our national interest.

1141
01:10:55,254 --> 01:10:57,924
However, you will be
legally responsible

1142
01:10:58,007 --> 01:10:59,884
for your actions thus far.

1143
01:11:00,176 --> 01:11:02,720
I'm sorry that
I could not assist you.

1144
01:11:06,432 --> 01:11:08,101
You guys knew

1145
01:11:08,184 --> 01:11:09,852
guns were being smuggled
into our country.

1146
01:11:11,354 --> 01:11:12,772
Why didn't you stop it?

1147
01:11:13,272 --> 01:11:15,108
And Yoo Da-hee?

1148
01:11:24,033 --> 01:11:26,452
She was sent here as a sacrifice.

1149
01:11:26,536 --> 01:11:29,998
She might not know,
but her mission is to die.

1150
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:32,709
And you'll let her die?

1151
01:11:33,334 --> 01:11:35,545
Why should we take care
of a foreign agent?

1152
01:11:36,379 --> 01:11:38,339
This will be like the Thai op.

1153
01:11:39,966 --> 01:11:41,676
The situation is a bit different.

1154
01:11:41,759 --> 01:11:42,969
She's not one of ours.

1155
01:11:43,261 --> 01:11:44,387
Would it make a difference...

1156
01:11:46,389 --> 01:11:47,348
if she were?

1157
01:11:53,813 --> 01:11:56,899
We only act on behalf of
the national interest.

1158
01:11:57,442 --> 01:11:58,443
Take care.

1159
01:12:04,115 --> 01:12:05,783
Please follow the protocol.

1160
01:12:09,412 --> 01:12:11,080
What the hell...

1161
01:12:18,588 --> 01:12:19,714
What did you talk about?

1162
01:12:19,797 --> 01:12:21,674
It's classified.

1163
01:12:22,175 --> 01:12:23,134
Classified?

1164
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:27,263
I have to whisper it.

1165
01:12:27,347 --> 01:12:29,390
What for? It's only us here.

1166
01:12:29,474 --> 01:12:30,850
We're being recorded.

1167
01:12:30,933 --> 01:12:32,435
You're a nobody.

1168
01:12:32,518 --> 01:12:33,728
We don't record everyone.

1169
01:12:33,811 --> 01:12:34,896
Then I won't tell you.

1170
01:12:43,571 --> 01:12:44,656
(Interrogation Room)

1171
01:12:46,157 --> 01:12:47,408
We shouldn't do that nowadays...

1172
01:12:47,492 --> 01:12:48,409
How about team dinner tonight?

1173
01:12:48,493 --> 01:12:50,411
- I've got dinner plans.
- Me too.

1174
01:12:50,495 --> 01:12:52,330
- All right, I'm buying.
- Hot pot for me.

1175
01:12:52,622 --> 01:12:53,581
I'm in.

1176
01:12:53,957 --> 01:12:54,958
Mr. Woo!

1177
01:12:55,041 --> 01:12:57,585
What you're doing is
a serious offense.

1178
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:06,970
What the hell do you want?

1179
01:13:07,595 --> 01:13:08,554
Car keys.

1180
01:13:08,846 --> 01:13:11,516
You think
we'll cooperate with you?

1181
01:13:11,599 --> 01:13:13,518
I'm a Korean police officer!

1182
01:13:16,145 --> 01:13:17,105
Please give him a key.

1183
01:13:17,397 --> 01:13:18,982
I don't have a car.

1184
01:13:19,232 --> 01:13:20,775
Chief bought a new car.

1185
01:13:26,781 --> 01:13:29,617
Oh, yeah, my car...

1186
01:13:29,701 --> 01:13:31,494
You left it here last night.
It's in the parking lot.

1187
01:13:31,577 --> 01:13:32,537
You frigging...

1188
01:13:53,558 --> 01:13:56,227
Hey! If you leave now,
you're so done for!

1189
01:14:04,068 --> 01:14:06,112
Buddy! Stop that car!

1190
01:14:11,242 --> 01:14:13,077
He knows the car's mine.

1191
01:14:13,161 --> 01:14:15,455
He'll stop it
if the driver isn't me.

1192
01:14:16,873 --> 01:14:18,541
Salute! Take care, sir!

1193
01:14:24,047 --> 01:14:26,299
Drive carefully, you punk!

1194
01:14:33,264 --> 01:14:35,433
How many Yangpyeong soups
did we have already?

1195
01:14:35,516 --> 01:14:36,893
Six times. Six!

1196
01:14:37,143 --> 01:14:38,978
I said I prefer Guksu noodles,

1197
01:14:39,062 --> 01:14:40,063
but we never had it once!

1198
01:14:44,317 --> 01:14:45,318
Yeah, dude.

1199
01:14:45,401 --> 01:14:47,111
Look for that company's buildings

1200
01:14:47,195 --> 01:14:49,072
by Yangpyeong Route 6.

1201
01:14:49,155 --> 01:14:50,657
They've got two warehouses
in Yangpyeong.

1202
01:14:50,949 --> 01:14:53,034
One in Guksu-ri
and one in Geumgok-ri.

1203
01:14:53,493 --> 01:14:55,912
It's Guksu.
Send me the address.

1204
01:14:59,207 --> 01:15:00,833
Pull out.
I repeat, pull out.

1205
01:15:00,917 --> 01:15:02,251
An operator has been captured.

1206
01:15:02,335 --> 01:15:03,920
Permission to rescue him, over.

1207
01:15:04,212 --> 01:15:05,338
Shoot him, I repeat.

1208
01:15:05,421 --> 01:15:07,382
Shoot him and pull out, over.

1209
01:15:09,968 --> 01:15:12,387
She was sent here as a sacrifice.

1210
01:15:12,470 --> 01:15:13,972
Her mission is to die.

1211
01:15:24,857 --> 01:15:28,111
(Yangpyeong)

1212
01:15:29,654 --> 01:15:33,074
Gunshots were fired
in front of Jungil Police Station

1213
01:15:33,157 --> 01:15:34,867
around 3 PM today.

1214
01:15:35,118 --> 01:15:36,995
Three unidentified suspects
were shot

1215
01:15:37,078 --> 01:15:39,914
- Stupid idiots...
- and taken to the hospital...

1216
01:15:40,456 --> 01:15:43,459
But at least
he created an aura of terror.

1217
01:15:43,793 --> 01:15:45,670
Your ultimate goal was
to start a gang war

1218
01:15:46,129 --> 01:15:47,714
and sell guns to them?

1219
01:15:48,673 --> 01:15:50,717
I don't think you're a cop.

1220
01:15:51,050 --> 01:15:53,219
NIS? DSC?

1221
01:15:53,886 --> 01:15:56,681
Do you know
what Korea's biggest problem is?

1222
01:15:57,265 --> 01:16:00,018
Raising its citizens in a nursery.

1223
01:16:00,226 --> 01:16:02,103
It's the safest country,

1224
01:16:02,186 --> 01:16:03,855
but the government
has no authority.

1225
01:16:04,105 --> 01:16:06,899
The rich moan and have hissy fits,

1226
01:16:06,983 --> 01:16:08,735
and the government babies them.

1227
01:16:09,444 --> 01:16:12,238
Is there a future
for such a country?

1228
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,827
There's an easy fix for that.

1229
01:16:18,453 --> 01:16:20,413
Removing the nursery.

1230
01:16:20,955 --> 01:16:22,540
"The world is dangerous."

1231
01:16:22,624 --> 01:16:25,209
"Act out, and you'll get hurt."

1232
01:16:25,543 --> 01:16:28,755
To do this,
firearm usage must be allowed.

1233
01:16:28,838 --> 01:16:31,883
Scums who only assert their rights
without any skills.

1234
01:16:32,842 --> 01:16:36,387
They will shoot each other
and get killed.

1235
01:16:36,471 --> 01:16:38,348
Kill and be killed.
kill and be killed!

1236
01:16:39,307 --> 01:16:41,017
This is a revolution.

1237
01:16:41,434 --> 01:16:44,979
Heart surgery for South Korea.

1238
01:17:00,662 --> 01:17:01,621
They've arrived.

1239
01:17:04,082 --> 01:17:06,042
What about the girl?

1240
01:17:06,501 --> 01:17:09,379
It may cause problems

1241
01:17:09,462 --> 01:17:11,547
if we kill her.

1242
01:17:11,756 --> 01:17:13,466
Let's give her to the gangsters.

1243
01:17:14,759 --> 01:17:16,886
It may not be comfortable,

1244
01:17:16,970 --> 01:17:18,346
but try to relax.

1245
01:17:31,317 --> 01:17:33,486
All guns contain eight bullets.

1246
01:17:33,569 --> 01:17:36,155
The TT-33 models
don't have safety,

1247
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:37,198
so please be careful.

1248
01:17:37,282 --> 01:17:39,784
What a know-it-all.

1249
01:17:40,535 --> 01:17:42,537
When I attended college
in Washington,

1250
01:17:42,620 --> 01:17:45,581
I worked as an intern
at an arms association...

1251
01:17:45,665 --> 01:17:47,125
I got it!

1252
01:17:49,919 --> 01:17:50,878
I got it...

1253
01:17:53,840 --> 01:17:58,261
And I've got something upstairs
to test the guns.

1254
01:17:58,344 --> 01:17:59,721
She's a cutie,

1255
01:17:59,804 --> 01:18:01,764
so kill her or take her.

1256
01:18:02,140 --> 01:18:05,518
Interesting, good.

1257
01:18:06,894 --> 01:18:10,148
Hey. Any updates from
the Integrated Control Center?

1258
01:18:10,231 --> 01:18:13,443
No, there's too much traffic,
so it'll take a while.

1259
01:18:13,526 --> 01:18:14,819
Man...

1260
01:18:16,362 --> 01:18:18,114
- Hands up!
- Yes, sir.

1261
01:18:18,364 --> 01:18:19,907
I've only paid one out of

1262
01:18:19,991 --> 01:18:21,701
60 monthly installments...

1263
01:18:22,368 --> 01:18:23,328
You punks...

1264
01:18:24,287 --> 01:18:26,998
I haven't even peeled
all the plastic...

1265
01:18:29,542 --> 01:18:31,794
That looks important...

1266
01:18:35,798 --> 01:18:38,092
It's from the DSC.

1267
01:18:38,176 --> 01:18:39,218
I sent that request.

1268
01:18:39,302 --> 01:18:40,428
Go take a look.

1269
01:18:43,056 --> 01:18:44,265
What did you request?

1270
01:18:46,601 --> 01:18:48,061
That punk, Woo Su-han.

1271
01:18:48,144 --> 01:18:50,813
- I requested his service records.
- And?

1272
01:18:50,897 --> 01:18:52,690
He's ex-Special Forces 707.

1273
01:18:55,109 --> 01:18:56,069
That idiot?

1274
01:18:58,321 --> 01:18:59,906
He was dishonorably discharged.

1275
01:19:00,782 --> 01:19:01,866
What was the reason?

1276
01:19:02,075 --> 01:19:03,284
Disobeying an order, sir.

1277
01:19:03,368 --> 01:19:06,037
That idiot,
he did look disobedient.

1278
01:19:06,663 --> 01:19:09,624
But isn't 707
super hard to get into?

1279
01:19:09,707 --> 01:19:11,834
Right, it's really hard.

1280
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:14,420
He didn't work in the kitchen
or the Post Exchange?

1281
01:19:14,796 --> 01:19:15,755
No, sir.

1282
01:19:17,131 --> 01:19:18,883
He was a close combat instructor.

1283
01:19:19,968 --> 01:19:21,260
That dumbass?

1284
01:19:31,562 --> 01:19:32,814
Xiao-rong, where you going?

1285
01:19:33,147 --> 01:19:34,565
I think I heard something.

1286
01:19:44,826 --> 01:19:45,827
Chief!

1287
01:19:46,577 --> 01:19:48,204
It's okay. No one's here.

1288
01:19:56,546 --> 01:19:58,298
Sneakers over there.

1289
01:20:01,050 --> 01:20:02,719
What took you so long?

1290
01:20:02,969 --> 01:20:04,470
I got here as soon as possible.

1291
01:20:04,721 --> 01:20:05,847
Cops?

1292
01:20:06,097 --> 01:20:08,641
Don't worry. I lost them.
I did good, right?

1293
01:20:08,975 --> 01:20:10,518
Why didn't you bring them?

1294
01:20:10,601 --> 01:20:13,021
How could I?
They're after my ass!

1295
01:20:19,652 --> 01:20:22,030
You're not an NIS agent, right?

1296
01:20:22,322 --> 01:20:23,990
Me? Why would I be an NIS agent?

1297
01:20:24,365 --> 01:20:25,700
I knew it.

1298
01:20:27,160 --> 01:20:28,995
I thought you were an NIS agent.

1299
01:20:29,329 --> 01:20:31,331
Then why are you here?

1300
01:20:31,414 --> 01:20:32,248
All by yourself?

1301
01:20:36,878 --> 01:20:37,837
Yoo Da-hee.

1302
01:20:40,214 --> 01:20:42,133
I'm still owed 10,000 dollars.

1303
01:20:43,843 --> 01:20:45,053
Only after the job!

1304
01:20:45,136 --> 01:20:46,179
That's why I came.

1305
01:20:47,847 --> 01:20:49,182
I'll take care of this,
so call it in.

1306
01:20:49,682 --> 01:20:51,476
You nag even after I rescue you?

1307
01:20:55,730 --> 01:20:57,732
There's no signal here.

1308
01:20:58,566 --> 01:21:00,234
Send a text.
It'll work better.

1309
01:21:05,907 --> 01:21:07,367
Are you doing it on purpose?

1310
01:21:08,117 --> 01:21:08,993
What?

1311
01:21:09,077 --> 01:21:11,412
I don't know
what happened in the past,

1312
01:21:12,872 --> 01:21:14,874
but aren't you acting shallow

1313
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:16,334
to avoid getting hurt?

1314
01:21:21,130 --> 01:21:24,050
You saw right through me.
I think so too.

1315
01:21:25,802 --> 01:21:27,929
I shouldn't have said anything.

1316
01:21:45,697 --> 01:21:47,323
Da-hee, got anything?

1317
01:21:47,407 --> 01:21:48,366
What? Like what?

1318
01:21:52,829 --> 01:21:53,788
What do I...

1319
01:22:00,378 --> 01:22:01,587
Chief, what are you doing?

1320
01:22:01,879 --> 01:22:03,131
My eyes!

1321
01:22:07,093 --> 01:22:08,052
Let's go!

1322
01:22:22,275 --> 01:22:24,360
It really stings...

1323
01:22:28,615 --> 01:22:31,618
Is this the right way?

1324
01:22:31,951 --> 01:22:33,369
How should I know?
It's my first time here.

1325
01:22:40,501 --> 01:22:41,878
- Da-hee.
- Yes?

1326
01:22:42,837 --> 01:22:43,838
Stay back.

1327
01:23:41,562 --> 01:23:42,522
Let's go.

1328
01:24:00,915 --> 01:24:01,874
Xiao-rong!

1329
01:24:03,876 --> 01:24:04,836
What's going on?

1330
01:24:05,086 --> 01:24:07,797
I think we have uninvited guests.

1331
01:24:09,257 --> 01:24:10,675
To test these guns out,

1332
01:24:10,758 --> 01:24:12,593
mind if we go on a hunt?

1333
01:24:12,677 --> 01:24:14,762
Certainly, enjoy.

1334
01:24:26,274 --> 01:24:28,526
Da-rong, he's dead.

1335
01:24:34,532 --> 01:24:35,491
Da-rong...

1336
01:24:37,410 --> 01:24:39,245
I'm gonna kill him myself!

1337
01:24:50,715 --> 01:24:51,924
They're looking for someone.

1338
01:24:52,008 --> 01:24:53,676
They're looking for us.

1339
01:25:01,476 --> 01:25:02,435
What the!

1340
01:25:37,261 --> 01:25:38,221
Hey!

1341
01:25:40,473 --> 01:25:41,432
What happened?

1342
01:25:41,849 --> 01:25:43,059
That was nothing.

1343
01:25:47,271 --> 01:25:49,190
Da-hee, I got a text
from the cops.

1344
01:25:49,399 --> 01:25:51,109
Cops? They're on the way?

1345
01:25:51,734 --> 01:25:52,694
They found the dog.

1346
01:25:53,528 --> 01:25:54,487
What dog?

1347
01:25:54,904 --> 01:25:57,490
That woman's.
The missing dog.

1348
01:25:57,949 --> 01:25:59,951
That retriever? Dorothy?

1349
01:26:00,034 --> 01:26:01,953
I'm so glad they found her.

1350
01:26:02,370 --> 01:26:04,789
Who cares? We're in danger!

1351
01:26:05,373 --> 01:26:06,582
Don't worry.

1352
01:28:09,205 --> 01:28:10,456
Toss your gun.

1353
01:28:12,417 --> 01:28:15,044
If you do, we're both dead.

1354
01:28:17,797 --> 01:28:21,217
Then let's begin
with a bullet in her.

1355
01:28:27,765 --> 01:28:30,143
One in the chamber, you punk!

1356
01:28:30,393 --> 01:28:31,728
Toss your gun!

1357
01:31:41,668 --> 01:31:42,627
Yuri.

1358
01:31:43,211 --> 01:31:44,170
Yeri?

1359
01:31:50,677 --> 01:31:53,012
Me, Seulgi.

1360
01:31:53,680 --> 01:31:56,265
What do you mean?

1361
01:31:57,684 --> 01:31:59,268
He must be a Red Velvet fan too.

1362
01:31:59,352 --> 01:32:00,311
What?

1363
01:32:02,271 --> 01:32:03,898
Let's duel it out.

1364
01:32:03,982 --> 01:32:04,941
Seulgi.

1365
01:32:06,943 --> 01:32:08,361
What about Seulgi?

1366
01:32:11,906 --> 01:32:13,283
I'll lend you mine.

1367
01:32:16,869 --> 01:32:19,330
Holy crap, he almost got me.

1368
01:32:20,623 --> 01:32:21,624
No,

1369
01:32:21,708 --> 01:32:23,710
I think he tossed you one
to have a duel with you.

1370
01:32:33,761 --> 01:32:34,804
What a weirdo.

1371
01:32:34,887 --> 01:32:36,556
Why would anyone do a duel?

1372
01:32:53,531 --> 01:32:55,325
Hey! Think this through.

1373
01:32:55,408 --> 01:32:56,284
With someone of your caliber,

1374
01:32:56,367 --> 01:32:57,869
we can start a revolution.

1375
01:32:58,244 --> 01:33:00,204
And I'll pay you whatever.

1376
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:02,624
Revolution? What revolution?

1377
01:33:03,374 --> 01:33:04,959
He wants to flood Korea with guns.

1378
01:33:06,753 --> 01:33:07,712
For what?

1379
01:33:07,795 --> 01:33:10,089
We can clean up the scums
who are polluting this country.

1380
01:33:10,548 --> 01:33:11,799
That's what I'm doing.

1381
01:33:12,508 --> 01:33:15,094
No, not us!

1382
01:33:15,178 --> 01:33:17,597
We are revolutionists.
But the real scums!

1383
01:33:17,847 --> 01:33:20,224
Unskilled, dormant criminals!

1384
01:33:20,558 --> 01:33:22,977
We can clean up those scums!

1385
01:33:25,021 --> 01:33:26,147
Elaborate.

1386
01:33:26,230 --> 01:33:27,398
Those who pollute Korea

1387
01:33:27,482 --> 01:33:29,484
just because
they have the right to vote!

1388
01:33:29,567 --> 01:33:31,569
We must eradicate those scums!

1389
01:33:31,653 --> 01:33:32,612
Hey!

1390
01:33:36,115 --> 01:33:38,451
You sure like to talk.

1391
01:33:38,701 --> 01:33:40,244
No, it's not that...

1392
01:33:40,578 --> 01:33:42,205
I don't know why I'm here...

1393
01:33:42,288 --> 01:33:44,123
Dump him in the toilet.

1394
01:33:47,669 --> 01:33:48,962
I'm really sorry.

1395
01:33:49,045 --> 01:33:52,131
Couldn't I just
get a beating here?

1396
01:33:52,215 --> 01:33:54,842
I'll gladly get a beating!

1397
01:33:54,926 --> 01:33:56,344
Please, no!

1398
01:33:57,971 --> 01:33:59,889
Although it wasn't intentional,

1399
01:34:00,098 --> 01:34:01,849
my bosses are happy

1400
01:34:01,933 --> 01:34:03,434
about wrapping up this case

1401
01:34:03,518 --> 01:34:05,228
as a joint op with China.

1402
01:34:05,478 --> 01:34:06,813
Then get me out of here.

1403
01:34:07,522 --> 01:34:09,899
You stirred up way too much
trouble for us to do that.

1404
01:34:10,984 --> 01:34:12,568
There is one way though.

1405
01:34:12,652 --> 01:34:13,611
What?

1406
01:34:14,946 --> 01:34:16,781
Become our covert agent.

1407
01:34:17,115 --> 01:34:19,284
You want me to become
an NIS agent?

1408
01:34:20,785 --> 01:34:23,454
We received another request
for a joint op with China.

1409
01:34:23,538 --> 01:34:26,666
We believe you are perfect for it.

1410
01:34:27,041 --> 01:34:28,793
Are you nuts?
Do that again?

1411
01:34:28,876 --> 01:34:30,795
No way, I'm not doing it.

1412
01:34:32,964 --> 01:34:34,882
You'll be stuck here
for a while...

1413
01:34:35,717 --> 01:34:39,137
Wait, I stopped guns
from flooding our country...

1414
01:34:39,387 --> 01:34:41,264
- It should be an extenuating...
- Assault, bodily harm,

1415
01:34:41,347 --> 01:34:42,974
murder, manslaughter,
impersonating an officer,

1416
01:34:43,057 --> 01:34:44,517
breaking and entering,
obstruction of justice,

1417
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:46,686
robbery, damage to property...

1418
01:34:47,145 --> 01:34:48,438
So damn much...

1419
01:34:48,688 --> 01:34:50,523
Even with
an extenuating circumstance,

1420
01:34:50,606 --> 01:34:51,899
you'll get ten years at a minimum.

1421
01:34:53,568 --> 01:34:55,737
I'd rather stay here
for ten years.

1422
01:34:55,820 --> 01:34:57,488
I almost died so many times!

1423
01:34:58,323 --> 01:34:59,282
I'm not doing it.

1424
01:34:59,490 --> 01:35:01,075
Never, ever.

1425
01:35:06,414 --> 01:35:08,249
100,000 dollars' retainer.

1426
01:35:08,875 --> 01:35:11,461
Another 100,000 dollars
upon completion of the op.

1427
01:35:13,046 --> 01:35:14,213
Deal!

1428
01:35:15,298 --> 01:35:19,844
(Pediatric Cancer Ward)

1429
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:21,679
Ma'am?

1430
01:35:24,390 --> 01:35:26,976
- Yes?
- Sorry to bother you.

1431
01:35:27,226 --> 01:35:28,645
I need to get your signature.

1432
01:35:29,103 --> 01:35:30,313
For what?

1433
01:35:30,688 --> 01:35:32,398
Before we fix the surgery date,

1434
01:35:32,482 --> 01:35:34,150
the guardian needs to sign off.

1435
01:35:34,609 --> 01:35:36,819
Surgery date?

1436
01:35:37,528 --> 01:35:39,489
You decided to have it.

1437
01:35:39,572 --> 01:35:41,908
The surgery was already paid for.

1438
01:35:46,663 --> 01:35:48,498
I'm so thankful that

1439
01:35:48,581 --> 01:35:49,707
you resolved the incident.

1440
01:35:50,166 --> 01:35:52,293
No, we're the ones in your debt.

1441
01:35:56,172 --> 01:35:57,131
Eh?

1442
01:36:00,218 --> 01:36:01,386
It's been a while.

1443
01:36:01,886 --> 01:36:02,929
As you may already know,

1444
01:36:03,012 --> 01:36:05,473
he's your partner agent
for this joint op.

1445
01:36:05,556 --> 01:36:07,433
Good to meet you.
I'm Agent Chao.

1446
01:36:07,767 --> 01:36:08,726
I'm Woo Su-han.

1447
01:36:10,186 --> 01:36:11,145
"Agent"?

1448
01:36:11,938 --> 01:36:13,523
It worked out that way.

1449
01:36:13,606 --> 01:36:16,901
What happened to Agent Ama?

1450
01:36:16,985 --> 01:36:17,860
I can't reach him.

1451
01:36:17,944 --> 01:36:19,988
We are actively searching for him.

1452
01:36:22,073 --> 01:36:25,451
Could it be related
to the missing Dorothy case?

1453
01:36:26,869 --> 01:36:28,621
We must approach it
from that angle.

1454
01:36:28,705 --> 01:36:29,664
Dorothy?

1455
01:36:29,998 --> 01:36:33,459
Who exactly is Dorothy?

1456
01:36:35,253 --> 01:36:40,008
A codename for
a former KGB informant.

1457
01:36:41,801 --> 01:36:43,344
She was to hand over

1458
01:36:43,428 --> 01:36:45,388
a North Korean intel to Agent Ama,

1459
01:36:45,471 --> 01:36:47,765
but both are unreachable.

1460
01:36:48,099 --> 01:36:51,853
How was she supposed to
hand it over?

1461
01:36:52,145 --> 01:36:54,314
Dorothy loves gold,

1462
01:36:54,397 --> 01:36:56,065
so she normally embeds
a micro SD card

1463
01:36:56,149 --> 01:36:58,568
inside a gold bar.

1464
01:37:01,779 --> 01:37:03,698
Where's the gold pig?

1465
01:37:05,033 --> 01:37:06,576
- I sold it.
- What?

1466
01:37:06,659 --> 01:37:07,535
Pardon?

1467
01:37:07,619 --> 01:37:08,911
- It's nothing.
- Nothing, sir.

1468
01:37:08,995 --> 01:37:12,123
You are to disguise
as a couple and infiltrate

1469
01:37:12,206 --> 01:37:15,209
the place where we think
they're in captivity.

1470
01:37:15,293 --> 01:37:16,252
- A couple?
- A couple?

1471
01:37:16,753 --> 01:37:18,630
- You two are in sync.
- Of course not!

1472
01:37:18,713 --> 01:37:19,839
You're wearing matching outfits.

1473
01:37:19,922 --> 01:37:20,840
- No way!
- No way!

1474
01:37:20,923 --> 01:37:22,300
Totally in sync.

1475
01:37:27,889 --> 01:37:29,599
Do we have to dress like this?

1476
01:37:29,682 --> 01:37:31,851
It's Vladivostok!

1477
01:37:31,934 --> 01:37:33,770
Russia is so cold!

1478
01:37:33,978 --> 01:37:37,357
Look around.
No one's dressed like us.

1479
01:37:38,316 --> 01:37:41,361
They just don't know things!

1480
01:37:41,444 --> 01:37:43,655
They might get off en route.

1481
01:37:45,907 --> 01:37:46,866
Oh, yeah.

1482
01:37:47,241 --> 01:37:48,701
What was that text you got from

1483
01:37:48,785 --> 01:37:50,703
the cops about finding the dog?

1484
01:37:52,830 --> 01:37:53,873
It wasn't Dorothy.

1485
01:37:54,082 --> 01:37:56,376
How could you sell the gold pig?

1486
01:37:56,459 --> 01:37:58,336
If you hadn't sold it,
we would've been done by now.

1487
01:37:58,419 --> 01:38:00,755
Did you know it?
That it had an SD card?

1488
01:38:00,838 --> 01:38:01,756
Was I the only one?

1489
01:38:01,839 --> 01:38:03,883
Then why not get it back?

1490
01:38:06,260 --> 01:38:07,220
They melted it down...

1491
01:38:09,097 --> 01:38:10,640
You can't do anything right...

1492
01:38:11,766 --> 01:38:13,434
When is the informant coming?

1493
01:38:13,518 --> 01:38:15,687
The meeting point is
the cruise's bow.

1494
01:38:20,191 --> 01:38:21,985
Hello? Where are you?

1495
01:38:23,319 --> 01:38:24,279
Behind me?

1496
01:38:26,990 --> 01:38:27,991
There's an ocean.

1497
01:38:29,284 --> 01:38:30,285
What?

1498
01:38:34,914 --> 01:38:36,249
Why are you dressed like that?

1499
01:38:37,792 --> 01:38:39,460
We're taking this boat?

1500
01:38:39,752 --> 01:38:41,129
We have to go in stealthily.

1501
01:38:41,796 --> 01:38:43,423
I knew it.

1502
01:38:49,137 --> 01:38:50,930
Can we really get there
on this boat?

1503
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:52,473
We'll find out soon.

1504
01:38:52,557 --> 01:38:54,934
What? What the hell?

1505
01:38:55,018 --> 01:38:59,314

1507
01:39:05,320 --> 01:39:11,034
(WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY
KIM HYEONG-JOO)

1508
01:39:14,203 --> 01:39:18,374
So you don't remember anything?

1509
01:39:21,961 --> 01:39:22,879
No.

1510
01:39:22,962 --> 01:39:25,381
Any images that pop up?

1511
01:39:25,465 --> 01:39:27,133
Nothing like that?

1512
01:39:33,139 --> 01:39:34,724
I see a man,

1513
01:39:34,807 --> 01:39:37,894
naked and tied to a chair.

1514
01:39:37,977 --> 01:39:40,229
He was into BDSM...

1515
01:39:40,938 --> 01:39:43,524
And a gun, knife, and a needle.

1516
01:39:43,608 --> 01:39:45,318
I keep seeing those.

1517
01:39:45,568 --> 01:39:47,987
He had constant suicidal thoughts.

1518
01:39:49,113 --> 01:39:53,409
If it's okay,

1519
01:39:53,493 --> 01:39:57,872
I know someone
who may be able to help you.

1520
01:39:57,956 --> 01:39:59,624
Would you like to meet him?

1521
01:40:02,126 --> 01:40:04,879
I'm sure it's been tough.

1522
01:40:04,963 --> 01:40:08,216
Still, the social perception has
gotten so much better.

1523
01:40:08,299 --> 01:40:10,635
So don't do anything regrettable.

1524
01:40:11,302 --> 01:40:12,762
Here you were.

1525
01:40:12,845 --> 01:40:15,306
- We found your family member.
- Yeah?

1526
01:40:15,390 --> 01:40:20,186
Honey! Honey! Honey!

1527
01:40:21,312 --> 01:40:23,439
I looked everywhere for you!

1528
01:40:23,523 --> 01:40:25,900
Are you all right?

1529
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:27,318
"Honey"?

1530
01:40:27,652 --> 01:40:30,071
I'm his wife.

1531
01:40:31,447 --> 01:40:32,740
Not his aunt?

1532
01:40:33,491 --> 01:40:36,369
You're risking your life
with those words!

1533
01:40:37,412 --> 01:40:39,872
This is obviously very peculiar.

1534
01:40:39,956 --> 01:40:43,293
Why would this handsome man
marry someone like you?

1535
01:40:44,544 --> 01:40:47,130
What would you even know
about women's charms?

1536
01:40:47,922 --> 01:40:49,382
I really don't get it.

1537
01:40:50,216 --> 01:40:52,135
Honey, let's go somewhere else.

1538
01:40:52,468 --> 01:40:53,928
You had women hit on you
in the past.

1539
01:40:54,012 --> 01:40:55,555
And now, men too?

1540
01:40:55,638 --> 01:40:57,265
Where are you going?

1541
01:40:57,348 --> 01:40:59,183
Our home, of course.

1542
01:40:59,267 --> 01:41:00,852
None of your business!

1543
01:41:00,935 --> 01:41:02,812
How can we trust
a suspicious woman like you

1544
01:41:02,895 --> 01:41:04,772
when we don't even know
if you're a real couple?

1545
01:41:04,856 --> 01:41:07,608
Suspicious? We're married!

1546
01:41:07,692 --> 01:41:09,652
You're at least 20 years older!

1547
01:41:09,736 --> 01:41:10,737
What are you talking about?

1548
01:41:10,820 --> 01:41:12,655
I get Botox regularly!

1549
01:41:12,739 --> 01:41:14,949
Honey! Where are you going?

1550
01:41:15,033 --> 01:41:15,992
Careful!
