Hello darling? Did you get off work?

00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,292
Because I still have some works to do

17
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:00,333

19
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:08,250

29
00:04:57,792 --> 00:04:59,292

00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:03,292

31
00:05:03,292 --> 00:05:04,542

32
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,750
Wow it's cake!

33
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:15,667
Look so yummy

34
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:18,000
This remind me of the past

35
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,583
I used to steal a glance at you
from here

36
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:26,333
Things like this?

37
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:30,042
Yes, thing like that!

38
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,542
Because of my short nail...

39
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:43,333
Here, I will do it for you

40
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:01,917
I really thought this company was going
to collapse without me

41
00:06:01,917 --> 00:06:06,000
It did, I hate working
in this company without you

42
00:06:12,458 --> 00:06:13,458
Here

43
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:19,292

44
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,833
So good!

45
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,208

46
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,667
No, I am on a diet

47
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:28,292
It's just one bite

48
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,917
Here open wide~

49
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,667
how is it?

50
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,167
It's amazing

51
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:52,167
I think I'm only going
to eat this from now on

52
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
So ticklish

53
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,625
Shit! Shit! Shit!

54
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:55,375
Goodness you haven't left yet

55
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,958
Did you leave something here?

56
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,458
No. I am here because...

57
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:00,583
?

58
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,458
See her?　-See me?

59
00:09:03,875 --> 00:09:05,917
You've already had something

60
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:09,167
I thought you might get hungry
so I brought you something

61
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,708
I will have that too
thank you for consideration

62
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,792
You look so tired

63
00:09:14,792 --> 00:09:16,583
Do you still have a lot left?

64
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:19,708
Yes, I do

65
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,417
Please leave

66
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:24,042
So you have something to say?

67
00:09:24,042 --> 00:09:27,292
Yes, ummm I... I want...

68
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,292
It's okay, feel free to talk to me

69
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:34,125
Just... I just want to say...

70
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,083
Yes

71
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,250
Seyeong, why is your lip so red?

72
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,042
It's because... I ate something spicy

73
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:47,500
that cake?

74
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,292
Yes, that cake

75
00:09:50,292 --> 00:09:52,667
Isn't it strange that
now they have such thing as spicy cake

76
00:09:52,667 --> 00:09:55,375
Ahh spicy flavor cake

77
00:09:56,542 --> 00:09:58,292
So you were saying?

78
00:09:58,292 --> 00:09:59,250
Right

79
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:03,625
Seyeong...

80
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:06,167
You know I really like pork

81
00:10:06,167 --> 00:10:08,083
I love it so much I can eat
whole big size pork all by myself

82
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,583
But yesterday
I couldn't even take a one bite...

83
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:13,000
So I wondered for that reason all day

84
00:10:14,208 --> 00:10:16,958
And I realized it was because of you!

85
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:21,875
I couldn't eat any of it
because I wanted to eat it with you!

86
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:25,542
Why are you telling me
about pork all of sudden

87
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,875
Sure than let's have pork
for staff dinner

88
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:31,042
No it's not that I mean...

89
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,875
I mean...

90
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:37,208
I really like you

91
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,250
I really do

92
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:41,417
what?

93
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:43,625
It's all because of you

94
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,917
-It was because you were so nice to me
-What is she talking about?

95
00:10:45,917 --> 00:10:47,250
-and buying me coffee
-What is she talking about?

96
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,250
and and cheering me up when I'm down

97
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,042
But I'm...

98
00:10:50,042 --> 00:10:52,875
Why not? is it because I am too young?

99
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:53,875
I am very mature

100
00:10:53,875 --> 00:10:58,500
you will never see me
as a child if you go out with me

101
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,958
But you know I have a boyfriend

102
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:09,708
I know that's not true

103
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:13,250
That? that is just a gift from my friend

104
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,583
I also saw TOP L app on your phone

105
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,583
Top L??? You little...

106
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:24,875
Seyeong

107
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:29,750
I really really want to go out with you

108
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,792
Jooa... the truth is...

109
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,542
No stop! stop! stop!

110
00:11:53,542 --> 00:11:55,167
Damn it

111
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,458
Hyemi?? but how?

112
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:14,000
How have you been jooha...

113
00:12:17,792 --> 00:12:18,667
Your pants!

114
00:12:27,667 --> 00:12:30,000
So...they are...

115
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,083
Oh my gosh...

116
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,542
I haven't given up on you

117
00:12:57,542 --> 00:12:58,542
Pardon me?

118
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,542
One's mind is like waving reeds

119
00:13:10,292 --> 00:13:11,417
She's kind of cute

120
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,583
Why do i feel so cold?

121
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,417
I'm watching you

122
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:35,417
I think I should get things straight!

123
00:13:45,667 --> 00:13:47,292
Ah? Ms.Na

124
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,000

125
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,958

126
00:13:57,417 --> 00:13:58,792
Wow

127
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:05,500
Oh, Jooa...

128
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,333
Hey,
why do you have Top L App on your phone?

129
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:39,375
It's... because... my friend...
I don't have it anymore see?

130
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,083
Let me see

131
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,833
See? I've deleted it!

132
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:45,208
I've deleted it!　-Don't download it

133
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:50,250
I download it, just out of curiosity.
I've never used it

134
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,000
Is that true?

135
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,083
Really not even once,

136
00:14:54,083 --> 00:14:55,708
how about you
do you have that on your phone?

137
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,250
I don't have it

138
00:14:57,250 --> 00:14:59,125
Than how do you know about that?

139
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,458
what do you mean how?
Everyone knows what that is

140
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:04,542
Are you quizing me?

141
00:15:04,542 --> 00:15:06,250
Anyway I really didn't know about that

142
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,792
Sure sure

143
00:15:07,792 --> 00:15:09,917
Really I didn't know

144
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:15,333
There will be no next time.
I have my eyes on you

145
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:17,708
Okay okay I promise you
I will never do it again
