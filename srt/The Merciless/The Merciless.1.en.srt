7
00:00:49,757 --> 00:00:51,592
You eat fish really well.

8
00:00:51,717 --> 00:00:52,927
You like them?

9
00:00:53,594 --> 00:00:55,596
Can't have enough.

10
00:00:55,888 --> 00:00:57,306
It's good raw,

11
00:00:57,723 --> 00:01:00,977
fried, and in
any shape or form.

12
00:01:02,061 --> 00:01:04,564
- I don't eat them.
- Why not?

13
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,650
The thing about fish is,
look at it,

14
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,986
they die with open eyes.

15
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:13,698
It looks like they're
glaring at me, talking shit.

16
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,032
I don't like fish.

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,246
What about anchovies?
I know you eat them.

18
00:01:20,788 --> 00:01:22,164
Anchovies are cool.

19
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,167
They're fish too,
with eyes no less.

20
00:01:25,626 --> 00:01:28,879
They got tiny beady eyes.

21
00:01:29,797 --> 00:01:32,883
I can't look in the eye
when I'm working.

22
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,177
But Jae-ho's the opposite.

23
00:01:35,177 --> 00:01:38,889
He kills while looking
at them in the eye.

24
00:01:38,889 --> 00:01:41,225
So he eats fish so well,
he only eats fish.

25
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:47,481
You get animated when you
talk about Mr. Han Jae-ho.

26
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,899
All giddy.

27
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,821
I don't think he has
guilty conscience.

28
00:01:54,238 --> 00:01:57,617
But that's not always so bad.

29
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:02,204
It completely advanced
our methods of work.

30
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:07,501
In the Stone Age,
they used stones to kill.

31
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:11,797
In Bronze and Iron Ages,
knives and axes.

32
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:15,176
Nowadays, it's a gun.

33
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,887
Guns mitigate guilty conscience.

34
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,222
Probably clue to longer range.

35
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,433
What the hell
are you saying?

36
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,357
Man...

37
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:32,860
Can't bear to watch.

38
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:35,571

The sideline show.

46
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:39,844
The color of this car.

47

That tenacity of yours.

55
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:05,763
My legal team wants to
file a lawsuit against you

56
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:09,225
for all the loss of
our work hours.

57
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:12,311

61
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,956

62
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:35,251

and promotion.

63
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,254
Help me out.

64
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:42,842

bring us the evidence.

65
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:48,222

66
00:05:48,472 --> 00:05:51,433

dick measuring already.

77

00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,582

109
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:56,989
What is it?

110
00:10:58,323 --> 00:11:03,245
There are 2 types of assholes
behind these walls.

111
00:11:05,497 --> 00:11:10,669
Those you can fuck with
and those you shouldn't.

112
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:15,757
The ones you fucked with today
were the latter.

113
00:11:16,925 --> 00:11:18,719
And you?

114
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:29,229
What do you think?

115
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:33,692
The one I shouldn't?

116
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,698
Nope.

117
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,535
I'm the one
who draws the line.

118
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,623
Don't raise your sentence
for no reason.

119
00:11:56,548 --> 00:11:57,633
Wow.

120
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,137
Even your bruises
are pretty.

121
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:26,662
Bang!

122
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,525
You've received
grace of the Lord.

123
00:12:57,734 --> 00:13:00,779
Those brutes aren't
the type to let things go.

124
00:13:01,321 --> 00:13:03,824
They decided to let
the kitchen incident slide.

125
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,542
As a fellow child of God,
why don't we become friends?

126
00:13:13,709 --> 00:13:14,835
I'm not religious.

127
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:18,422
These criminals won't get me
when I'm near you.

128
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:22,509
You've gained quite a rep
after the slap fest.

129
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,315
He must be tight
with the guards.

130
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:38,150
Probably about ciggy tax.

131
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,693
Ciggy?

132
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:44,281
Don't release all at once
like last time.

133
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:47,409
You'll receive payment for
3 cartons tomorrow.

134
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:53,040
Ciggy distribution right is
an important source of fund.

135
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,795
And these demonic scumbags
will do anything to seize it.

136
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:05,886
Han Jae-ho took it over
as soon as he arrived.

137
00:14:06,678 --> 00:14:07,763
Hallelujah.

138
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:12,434
Han started out by
dealing meth in his teens,

139
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:17,939
so he's not an original gangster,
but when he appears,

140
00:14:18,273 --> 00:14:20,901
even the OGs will part
like the Red Sea.

141
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,905
Having a private phone
is an open secret,

142
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,948
he's like a caged
Jesus Christ.

143
00:14:27,407 --> 00:14:31,119
He filled his wing with
his disciples and have feasts.

144
00:14:31,119 --> 00:14:32,537
Boys! Fill your glasses.

145
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:36,833

146
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:41,421

147
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:43,298

148
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,966

149
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:48,053

<i>13 days after release</i>

151
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,870
Han spoke highly of you.

152
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,206
Good head and
competent fist.

153
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:20,210
Not sure about the head,
but fist not so much.

154
00:15:21,002 --> 00:15:23,463
Would you like to
check firsthand?

155
00:15:26,299 --> 00:15:27,050
How?

156
00:15:27,175 --> 00:15:31,513
He wants to dance with you.

157
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:34,558
Don't embarrass yourself
in front of your boys.

158
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:35,767
That's enough.

159
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,018

160
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,022

161
00:15:41,731 --> 00:15:42,983
Me, obviously.

162
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,202
Yo, punk ass.

163
00:15:54,786 --> 00:16:00,041
If you beat me, I'll suck
your cock and sing the anthem.

164
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,295
I don't swing that way.

165
00:16:04,754 --> 00:16:05,881

166
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,177

167
00:16:27,527 --> 00:16:28,737
Motherfucker!

168
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:37,954
Come here.

169
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,753
Dear nephew.

170
00:16:45,795 --> 00:16:51,051
Differentiate work and leisure.

171
00:16:52,427 --> 00:16:55,597
Don't be like your idiot father.

172
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,475
Be good.

173
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:09,736

174
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:13,490
Fuck!

175
00:17:18,286 --> 00:17:19,496
Are you good?

176
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,669
Go party some more,
why are you here?

177
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,839
Were you crying?

178
00:17:32,425 --> 00:17:33,760
Was I crying?

179
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:34,844
Sir?

180
00:17:35,011 --> 00:17:37,097
Was I crying, you fuck!

181
00:17:37,138 --> 00:17:38,431
Yes, you were.

182
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:42,060
Fucking dipshit,
when the fuck did I cry?!

183
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,396
Get out, asshole!
You're dead!

184
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:51,111
How was Jae-ho
inside the joint?

185
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,531
He probably acted like
a king without me.

186
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,742
More like a president, sir.

187
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,536
What's the difference?

188
00:18:00,036 --> 00:18:02,080
A president has a term.

189
00:18:03,164 --> 00:18:05,542
And that term is finite.

190
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,941
Oh Lord,
the time has come.

191
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:32,527
What is?

192
00:18:33,653 --> 00:18:34,946
Kim Sung-han.

193
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,574
You must've heard of him.

194
00:18:37,782 --> 00:18:39,492
He's the whale
of all crimes.

195
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:46,249
Let's watch.

196
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,919
It's election time.

197
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,915
Your reputation precedes you,
pleasure to meet you.

198
00:19:26,956 --> 00:19:28,208
I'm Han Jae-ho.

199
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:33,088
So you're the one
in charge around here.

200
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,048
I don't like to
beat around the bush,

201
00:19:35,298 --> 00:19:37,175
so I'll make one thing clear.

202
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:39,135
Let's go 50-50
on cigarette business.

203
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:42,138
Price at market value,
and supply is pending...

204
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:43,181
Hey.

205
00:19:45,975 --> 00:19:47,268
I'm Kim Sung-han.

206
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:51,231
Do I look like
a tobacco pusher?

207
00:19:52,732 --> 00:19:55,944
I heard you sold drugs
for a living.

208
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:07,330
If you go into war now,
who do you think will win?

209
00:20:07,747 --> 00:20:11,084
Or would you like
to dance with me?

210
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:16,589
Boss,

211
00:20:16,631 --> 00:20:18,591
Ho-yeol was taken
to security.

212
00:20:38,194 --> 00:20:41,239
How about a word?

213
00:20:42,949 --> 00:20:44,284
Security Chief!

214
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,787
What's going on?

215
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,708
Didn't know about
the inspection this month?

216
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,084
Is this a joke?

217
00:20:58,339 --> 00:20:59,215
What?

218
00:20:59,257 --> 00:21:00,550
Was it Kim Sung-han?

219
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,637
Did he bribe you?
More than mine?

220
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,891
Son of a bitch!
What did you say?

221
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,271
You fucking pest!

222
00:21:16,816 --> 00:21:18,276
Damn it.

223
00:21:20,069 --> 00:21:21,863
Fucking cockroach.

224
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,953
That's enough, stop.

225
00:21:29,245 --> 00:21:31,331
Stop it!
You'll kill him.

226
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:32,916
Get him up.

227
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:40,089
- To the isolation.
- Yes, sir.

228
00:22:04,447 --> 00:22:06,282
The election is over.

229
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:09,869
Kim and the warden are
from the same town.

230
00:22:16,751 --> 00:22:19,212
631, come out.

231
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,882
Han Jae-ho's out, boss.

232
00:22:24,175 --> 00:22:26,636
The Security Chief
split up his boys,

233
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,805
so he'll be alone for a while.

234
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:34,435
He may be tenacious,
but he can't survive alone.

235
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,023
Let's drink.

236
00:22:39,315 --> 00:22:40,149
Everyone!

237
00:24:05,234 --> 00:24:06,277
Guard!

238
00:24:07,403 --> 00:24:09,030
He's got a shiv!

239
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,448
Guard!

240
00:24:16,537 --> 00:24:17,705
Yours?

241
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,540
It's not mine!

242
00:24:19,707 --> 00:24:23,002
I saw it coming out of
his sleeve.

243
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:29,884
Can you prove it?

244
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:33,930
How? Should I get you
a photographic evidence?

245
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:44,732
Knock, knock.

246
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:57,328
Your life is worth
a single carton?

247
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:01,749
A probe will begin tomorrow.

248
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:03,835
No need.

249
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:08,673
Kim and the Security Chief are
probably jerking each other off.

250
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,468
But something's really off.

251
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:18,433
At this point,
I already lost the war.

252
00:25:18,766 --> 00:25:20,476
So why try to bury me?

253
00:25:26,649 --> 00:25:28,151
Why did you do it?

254
00:25:30,611 --> 00:25:34,782
My mom told me not to ignore
the suffering of the petty.

255
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,247
Leave, see you tomorrow.

256
00:25:42,623 --> 00:25:43,458
Okay.

257
00:26:02,935 --> 00:26:04,729
Do you still have
your phone?

258
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:09,233
You got something to report?

259
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,571
I found this inside the joint,

260
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,615
you should really take a look.

261
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:19,702
There are some
interesting images.

262
00:26:30,963 --> 00:26:36,177
I'd like to report this guy for
illegally distributing cigarettes.

263
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:39,847
This guy?

264
00:26:40,431 --> 00:26:41,599
'Gentleman,' please.

265
00:26:42,683 --> 00:26:43,768
This gentleman.

266
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,895
Are you threatening me?

267
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:52,527
How can we ever
threaten you, sir?

268
00:26:52,985 --> 00:26:56,364
Since we got the photos,
it'll be easy to file the report.

269
00:26:56,697 --> 00:26:57,990
You bastards!

270
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,910
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

271
00:27:00,993 --> 00:27:03,913
Motherfuckers!
I've fucking had it!

272
00:27:05,706 --> 00:27:08,501
You fucking rat,
do I look easy?

273
00:27:08,584 --> 00:27:09,669
Not at all.

274
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,713
I was gonna report him for
possessing that too.

275
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,006
You conniving fuck!

276
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,677
How dare you!

277
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:21,722
Don't you get it?

278
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:28,312
We sent those pics to
this gentleman's crew outside.

279
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,816
If we can't be reached
for a week or no visits allowed,

280
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:35,361
they'll send those pics
to the prosecutor.

281
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,949
Chief.

282
00:27:40,616 --> 00:27:44,537
I'm risking just a year
added to my time,

283
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:48,749
but when a case opens up,
who do you think I'll name?

284
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,519
When I was a kid,

285
00:28:09,937 --> 00:28:14,317
your memoir made
a strong impression on me.

286
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:19,113
'My Fist Cried Every Night'...

287
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:26,579
You said you fought
3O men and won,

288
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,788
was that for real?

289
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:33,085
I thought you threw
fireballs and shit.

290
00:28:40,259 --> 00:28:42,470
Boss, it's ready.

291
00:28:43,971 --> 00:28:45,014
One moment.

292
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,568
Ouch!

293
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,675
Wait outside.

294
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,821
Motherfucker!

295
00:29:41,904 --> 00:29:47,326
You're a real original gangsta.

296
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:51,747
Let me ask you something.

297
00:29:52,623 --> 00:29:55,042
We don't cross paths outside,

298
00:29:55,501 --> 00:29:57,878
so why come after me?

299
00:29:58,045 --> 00:30:03,676
I really don't understand.

300
00:30:07,221 --> 00:30:10,725
My apologies,
let's end it here.

301
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,227
Wrong!

302
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:16,105
Not the right answer.

303
00:30:20,484 --> 00:30:21,694
Ko Byung-chul!

304
00:30:21,777 --> 00:30:23,696
It was Chairman Ko.

305
00:30:23,904 --> 00:30:25,823
Shut your fucking hole!

306
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:30,286
Your own boss gave you up.

307
00:30:30,369 --> 00:30:32,872
Lying sack of shit.
Don't make shit up!

308
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:34,999
5kg shipment in August!

309
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:38,085
If my boss buried you,

310
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,921
Ko promised us a third.

311
00:30:40,921 --> 00:30:42,173
Son of a bitch!

312
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:44,800
That's enough!

313
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:55,936
That answer...

314
00:30:57,813 --> 00:31:00,691
sounds convincing.

315
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:03,903
Right?

316
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,740
I'm Kim Sung-han.

317
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,785
What happened today...

318
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:16,665
There is no tomorrow for us,
your threats don't work.

319
00:31:19,835 --> 00:31:24,590
So many men
accidentally die in here.

320
00:31:25,132 --> 00:31:26,967
Alright.

321
00:31:28,677 --> 00:31:30,262
Look at me.

322
00:31:30,971 --> 00:31:34,475
Come on,
look at me.

323
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,853
This won't end
if you don't.

324
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,909
Very good.

325
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:09,218
Play ball.

326
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:09,885
Watch.

327
00:32:09,885 --> 00:32:13,973
<i>32 days after release</i>

328
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,353
Strike!

329
00:32:22,898 --> 00:32:23,858
Out!

330
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,027
Are you absolutely sure

331
00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:29,822
Kim died of heart attack?

332
00:32:31,907 --> 00:32:35,244
So, Jae-ho isn't after my neck?

333
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,288
Not this again.

334
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:39,915
Uncle, I checked it myself.

335
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,585
Kim had high blood pressure.

336
00:32:43,502 --> 00:32:48,632
You get more suspicious
as you grow older.

337
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:50,801
And full of regrets too.

338
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,681
Thank you.

339
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,898
Uncle,

340
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:08,027
will you put out
a hit on Jae-ho again?

341
00:33:08,527 --> 00:33:10,988
He still has some use left.

342
00:33:11,071 --> 00:33:14,074
Your orphanage friendship
really is forever.

343
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,493
I doubt that.

344
00:33:15,826 --> 00:33:18,078
You and I are
bound by blood.

345
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,040
This is a family business.

346
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,628
Okay, I got a question.

347
00:33:25,836 --> 00:33:26,712
Sure.

348
00:33:27,671 --> 00:33:33,052
You took in a mutt
off the street and raised it,

349
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,887
took good care of it.

350
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,891
Its fur looks healthy
and it's bulking up.

351
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:46,982
But as it gets bigger,
it stops wagging its tail.

352
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:50,861
It barks and shows
its teeth sometimes.

353
00:33:52,112 --> 00:33:56,283
What's funny is that,
it doesn't know its place.

354
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:58,994
A mutt...

355
00:33:59,995 --> 00:34:01,455
BYUFlg-gab.

356
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,041
What should its owner do?

357
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,918
If you were me...

358
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:13,884
Jae-ho, that fuck!

359
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,012
You bastard!

360
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,890
The chairman could've been hurt!

361
00:34:20,057 --> 00:34:22,393
It's been a while,
I got no control!

362
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:24,353
So sorry, chairman!

363
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,941
Go easy!

364
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:31,360
Sons of bitches.

365
00:34:32,027 --> 00:34:35,030
If I let him be,
he'll eventually bite.

366
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,408
Then he should be put down.

367
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,493
Indeed.

368
00:34:39,910 --> 00:34:44,164
After this Russian deal,
let's set a clay.

369
00:34:52,089 --> 00:34:53,632
<i>Oceane Import,</i>

370
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,218
<i>where all fresh fishes are</i>

371
00:34:56,343 --> 00:34:58,012
<i>Over 700 types,</i>

372
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,806
<i>delicious and fresh food</i>

373
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:04,143
<i>Oceane Import
home shopping!</i>

374
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,980
<i>Call us, we'll deliver
anywhere in the country!</i>

375
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:12,693
<i>3 years and 4 months ago,
Busan Metro Police</i>

376
00:35:14,945 --> 00:35:16,363
Why are we watching this?

377
00:35:16,363 --> 00:35:19,658
He's the primary target
of this operation.

378
00:35:19,783 --> 00:35:22,244
Ko Byung-chul,
52 years old.

379
00:35:22,536 --> 00:35:26,790
Current head of Oceane Import,
vice chair of Fisheries Coop Union.

380
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:27,916
Chairman Ko?

381
00:35:28,125 --> 00:35:31,253
He used to provide strippers
for Russian bar in Seoul,

382
00:35:31,378 --> 00:35:34,048
and partnered up with
Vladivostok's Gegard mob.

383
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:37,468
Vitaly Gegard is an ex-officer,
and operates over 8O ships

384
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:41,138
that are docked
in Busan harbor.

385
00:35:50,814 --> 00:35:52,066
Continue.

386
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:57,446
In 2008,
Ko relocated to Busan,

387
00:35:57,446 --> 00:36:00,199
and founded Oceane,
an aquatic importer.

388
00:36:01,158 --> 00:36:04,828
It's a front for a massive
smuggling operation.

389
00:36:10,167 --> 00:36:13,712
Using ice boxes to move
meth, hashish and cocaine,

390
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:16,006
they smuggled about
15kg last year alone.

391
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,967
You should've caught him then!

392
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:23,305
Why cry over spilled milk!
This is a bad habit!

393
00:36:24,139 --> 00:36:25,224
Dump this case,

394
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,019
and bring me
press-friendly cases.

395
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,729
Like a celeb drug scandal.

396
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:39,113
Why don't we
officially import meth?

397
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:44,159
I heard the high
is amazing!

398
00:36:44,326 --> 00:36:46,036
Let's make our people
happy for once.

399
00:36:46,036 --> 00:36:47,705
<i>'</i> Enough!
<i>'</i> What?!

400
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,082
Sir?

401
00:36:50,582 --> 00:36:51,667
Why not?

402
00:36:52,042 --> 00:36:53,502
This is an economic issue.

403
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:58,757
Russia is reducing
the fishing quota every year,

404
00:36:59,007 --> 00:37:04,012
and if the mafia-run ships
stop coming, it'll be a disaster.

405
00:37:05,305 --> 00:37:07,850
So, fish comes before drugs?

406
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:11,770
Manage your anger
and do as you're told!

407
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:14,314
By working press-friendly cases,

408
00:37:14,606 --> 00:37:16,859
will you reach the HQ
by your 60th birthday?

409
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,820
Han will be out in 2-3 years.

410
00:37:20,362 --> 00:37:23,157
We can lure him and
get them in one fell swoop.

411
00:37:23,323 --> 00:37:24,575
What's your plan?

412
00:37:28,036 --> 00:37:29,204
Undercover detail.

413
00:38:02,362 --> 00:38:03,405
You Okay?

414
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,955
It's a 3-year gig-

415
00:38:12,247 --> 00:38:13,957
That's a long one.

416
00:38:14,082 --> 00:38:15,334
Agency cooperation?

417
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:18,420
None, police, prosecution,
KSA, customs, no one'll know.

418
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:21,256
Are we infiltrating
North Korea?

419
00:38:21,256 --> 00:38:23,300
One recruit, one joint.

420
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,222
I volunteer for the recruit!

421
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,265
Asshole, put your hand down!

422
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,017
You're still a bachelor.

423
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,436
I'm a family man
with a wife and a baby.

424
00:38:35,145 --> 00:38:36,104
Chief.

425
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:38,315
My son spoke his first word.

426
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,651
What do you think that was?

427
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:44,404
We're selling our families now?
My mom's sick, like super sick.

428
00:38:44,404 --> 00:38:45,531
You know all about that.

429
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:47,950
His first word was, "daddy".

430
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:51,245
We played so much Yankee
prenatal music, so he spoke English.

431
00:38:51,286 --> 00:38:54,790
His daddy can't go
to the joint at this point.

432
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:56,083
Jo Hyun-su,

433
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:58,418
this one's all you.

434
00:39:03,131 --> 00:39:04,258
For a such crucial mission,

435
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:08,011
Why'd you use a rookie
like myself?

436
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,681
Being humble doesn't suit you.

437
00:39:11,473 --> 00:39:14,434
You were top of your class
in the Academy.

438
00:39:16,353 --> 00:39:18,272
I can't do this.
No, I won't do this.

439
00:39:19,439 --> 00:39:21,316
I made myself clear.

440
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:27,739
Use him for once,
he doesn't do shit!

441
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:30,242
Take that back!
I do plenty of shit!

442
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,869
I'm the one getting shit done!

443
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,161
Why's he barking
up my ass?

444
00:39:34,454 --> 00:39:37,749
Chief, joint for him,
recruit for me, okay?

445
00:39:49,636 --> 00:39:51,388
I'll get your mom a kidney.

446
00:39:57,686 --> 00:40:01,315
We'll cover her dialysis bills
until we find her a kidney.

447
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,483
Your call.

448
00:40:16,914 --> 00:40:20,918
It was an Incheon-bound ship
from Hong Kong,

449
00:40:21,376 --> 00:40:23,629
it had 20,000 bamboo trees,
and ephetrine...

450
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:26,381
and ephedrine.

451
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:29,509
The ship's docking time leaked...

452
00:40:29,509 --> 00:40:31,136
Is this a presentation?

453
00:40:31,511 --> 00:40:33,180
It's a tale of exploits.

454
00:40:33,221 --> 00:40:35,390
I can sell it in live situation.

455
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,394
Chicks nowadays are fresh.

456
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,485
Dude!

457
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:48,070
Can I work?

458
00:40:48,153 --> 00:40:51,865
Your tongue is more vital
than your fist.

459
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,283
Get into it.

460
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,708
We were coming into
Incheon at 2 AM,

461
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,543
and that leaked.

462
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,546
The po-pos littered the harbor.

463
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,340
So what can we do?

464
00:41:11,009 --> 00:41:14,513
Fuck, we unloaded the bamboos,
and stayed on the ship for a week,

465
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:16,306
and we had fuck-all to do.

466
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:21,353
Then we discovered
Chinese Viagra knock-offs.

467
00:41:21,478 --> 00:41:24,022
The Chinese-Koreans were like,

468
00:41:24,481 --> 00:41:26,400
let's see if these
work or not,

469
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,821
and they all had
huge boners.

470
00:41:30,904 --> 00:41:32,948
So the knock-offs worked?

471
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:34,449
They totally did.

472
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:38,036
They couldn't hold it
and got off and arrested.

473
00:41:38,161 --> 00:41:40,497
That worked out in our favor.

474
00:41:40,497 --> 00:41:43,458
We called the trucks
and unloaded in record time,

475
00:41:43,458 --> 00:41:45,377
and took off.

476
00:41:46,586 --> 00:41:48,171
And the Chinese-Koreans?

477
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,464
We unloaded all our shit.

478
00:41:49,881 --> 00:41:53,468
The po-pos had nothing,
so they were released.

479
00:41:53,593 --> 00:41:54,511
Hallelujah!

480
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:56,555
Viagra saved you all.

481
00:41:57,347 --> 00:41:59,641
Viagra brings back
dead boners back to life.

482
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:07,524
No way!

483
00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:20,245
I'll grant you one wish.

484
00:42:22,497 --> 00:42:23,415
I...

485
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,043
want a new cell!

486
00:42:26,626 --> 00:42:28,128
To the biggest one!

487
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,547
That's my cell.

488
00:42:30,922 --> 00:42:33,925
Han is not a gullible target.

489
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:38,305
Is he biting at all?

490
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,640
Well, a little...

491
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:45,562
We'll find out soon.
Any news?

492
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:48,315
<i>Congrats, we got a kidney.</i>

493
00:42:48,523 --> 00:42:50,233
<i>She'll get a surgery soon.</i>

494
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:52,486
Seriously?

495
00:42:53,945 --> 00:42:55,030
Okay!

496
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,076
Good news?

497
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,828
Okay, mom,
I'll call you again soon!

498
00:43:14,674 --> 00:43:15,967
You prefer

499
00:43:17,594 --> 00:43:20,597
your mom's voice
over a hottie's?

500
00:43:20,722 --> 00:43:22,557
You're clueless.

501
00:43:22,557 --> 00:43:24,601
There's this thing
called 'family affection'.

502
00:43:24,684 --> 00:43:28,605
I never had a family,
so I can't relate.

503
00:43:28,688 --> 00:43:32,317
You got those minions
you call family outside.

504
00:43:32,818 --> 00:43:33,735
Wait!

505
00:43:34,694 --> 00:43:37,572
Speaking of which,
I should join you.

506
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:39,157
Right?

507
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,538
I kid, don't take it
so seriously.

508
00:43:48,041 --> 00:43:49,417
Isn't Kim Sung-han here?

509
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,336
Anything happened?

510
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:57,175
He died of heart attack
as soon as he arrived.

511
00:43:57,592 --> 00:43:58,677
Heart attack?

512
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:02,097
That's great news.

513
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:03,723
I looked into it,

514
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:07,727
that fucker was
sent here to bury you.

515
00:44:08,186 --> 00:44:09,521
Do you know who sent him?

516
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:13,316
The chairman did, asswipe.

517
00:44:19,656 --> 00:44:20,740
What a guy.

518
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:23,702
Fucking heart attack.

519
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:27,873
What will you do?

520
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:30,375
Gonna bury him
when you come out?

521
00:44:30,750 --> 00:44:32,711
I'll get everything ready.

522
00:44:35,088 --> 00:44:36,548
Ruthless fuck.

523
00:44:37,048 --> 00:44:39,843
How could you be so nonchalant
about killing family?

524
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:42,095
Fuck that shit!

525
00:44:42,637 --> 00:44:46,516
When my father died,
he tossed me in the orphanage!

526
00:44:46,641 --> 00:44:47,684
Look!

527
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:49,728
Look at this!

528
00:44:51,104 --> 00:44:53,857
I ordered the wrong noodles,

529
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:58,236
so he hit me with
a fucking ashtray!

530
00:44:58,695 --> 00:45:01,823
That was your fault.

531
00:45:03,658 --> 00:45:07,162
But the one I ordered was better.

532
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:15,795
If a war breaks out now,
boys will stick to money.

533
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:20,634
Let's sit this one out.

534
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,260
I can't do that.

535
00:45:23,553 --> 00:45:27,098
I'm sick of looking after
the senile fuck, bud.

536
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,768
By the way,

537
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:31,686
have you looked into it?

538
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:34,689
About that Jo Hyun-su?

539
00:45:35,523 --> 00:45:38,318
That bastard really was with
the Golden Crane gang.

540
00:45:48,245 --> 00:45:49,788
Hey! Leave us!

541
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,304
They got balls.

542
00:46:10,016 --> 00:46:12,936
Before forensics get him,
wipe his records.

543
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:16,731
Is Jo gonna be okay?

544
00:46:16,856 --> 00:46:18,525
He's still alive and kicking.

545
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,194
It's hard to blow cover
in there.

546
00:46:23,488 --> 00:46:24,864
We shouldn't notify
him of this.

547
00:46:24,864 --> 00:46:27,242
He could fumble
and ruin the operation.

548
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:29,244
When's his mother's surgery?

549
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:35,125
Yes, I'm being admitted today.

550
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:37,669
Thank you, chief.

551
00:46:40,171 --> 00:46:41,089
Yes.

552
00:46:43,049 --> 00:46:45,218
Is my son doing okay?

553
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:53,852
Photosynthesizing?

554
00:46:56,229 --> 00:46:57,897
It's a nice day.

555
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:05,030
Great indeed.

556
00:47:30,263 --> 00:47:32,265
Don't you fucking
lie to me!

557
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:34,100
- Calm down!
- You fucker!

558
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:37,645
Why'd she just drop dead?!

559
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:39,397
Calm down!

560
00:47:39,397 --> 00:47:42,859
Why would she just die,
you fucking liar!

561
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,446
I wanna see my mom...

562
00:47:46,571 --> 00:47:49,908
I'll see her and
come back!

563
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:51,618
Jo, sit down!

564
00:47:51,826 --> 00:47:54,788
I gotta see her!

565
00:47:55,955 --> 00:47:56,790
Sit!

Even for a clay.

569
00:48:25,610 --> 00:48:27,946
There's no one else to
hold her funeral.

Don't say that,

I've been rotting here for 2 years,
and I can't even bury mom?

578
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:10,572
If you won't let me out,
I'm gonna expose it all.

579
00:49:13,366 --> 00:49:16,202

581
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:21,749
How could you...

do this to me?

583

This isn't the time
to be cute.

585
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:53,364
Don't touch me.

586
00:49:56,993 --> 00:49:57,952
Alright.

587
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:00,955
I know what you're
going through.

588
00:50:01,122 --> 00:50:02,123
You do?

589
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,544
What would you know?

590
00:50:10,423 --> 00:50:11,549
Huh?

591
00:50:13,843 --> 00:50:16,971
How would you know that,
fucking asshole!

592
00:50:23,561 --> 00:50:25,021
Don't do anything
you'll regret.

593
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:32,403
What was that?

594
00:50:34,447 --> 00:50:36,032
Fuck you!

595
00:50:46,709 --> 00:50:48,002

<i>'</i> Let go!

599
00:51:30,086 --> 00:51:31,254
That's enough.

600
00:52:03,369 --> 00:52:05,204
This is interesting.

601
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:08,791
It felt like only yesterday,

602
00:52:08,916 --> 00:52:10,209
when you guys
tried to screw me.

603
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,463
Drink up.

604
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,676
You got a furlough today.

605
00:52:20,511 --> 00:52:23,181
You'll get two escorts,
and stay cuffed too.

606
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:29,228
Funeral home address.

607
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:34,901
Han paid for the entire funeral.

608
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:41,949
He threatened me
to release you early.

609
00:52:42,825 --> 00:52:45,203
But that's up to
the warden.

610
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,664
Be happy with a day furlough.

611
00:53:35,878 --> 00:53:37,797
I don't even remember
dad's face.

612
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:43,136
She was everything to me.

613
00:53:44,762 --> 00:53:49,100
It feels like I've been
thrown out by the world.

614
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:52,770
Forget it.

615
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,941
What would you know?

616
00:53:59,944 --> 00:54:07,452
Do you know who tried to
kill me for the first time?

617
00:54:12,331 --> 00:54:14,208
A woman I called mom.

618
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:21,924
After a drink, dad took pleasure
in beating her and me.

619
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:25,094
He was fine when sober.

620
00:54:25,094 --> 00:54:28,014
The problem was,
he drank everyday.

621
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:32,226
When I was 12 or so,

622
00:54:33,227 --> 00:54:38,316
we had dinner one day
but something felt off,

623
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,109
and food tasted weird too.

624
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:42,820
Mom tried to avoid
my eye contact.

625
00:54:43,821 --> 00:54:46,157
So I ran to the washroom,

626
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,203
stuck fingers down my throat
and threw up.

627
00:54:52,830 --> 00:54:54,290
And when I came back,

628
00:54:55,917 --> 00:55:04,175
both of my parents foamed
at the mouth and died.

629
00:55:06,552 --> 00:55:08,971
Bro, I'm sorry... I...

630
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:15,228
I'm quite used to
being thrown out.

631
00:55:17,146 --> 00:55:21,192
Anyway, the moral
of this story is,

632
00:55:26,864 --> 00:55:28,699
don't trust people,

633
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:32,829
trust the circumstances.

634
00:55:38,042 --> 00:55:39,418
When you get out,

635
00:55:40,878 --> 00:55:43,214
do you really want to
partner up?

636
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:49,554
Fucking hell,
if you like,

637
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:52,932
let's give it a go.

638
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:56,561
Lost boys banding together.

639
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,022
And you know,

640
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:03,442
it'd be fun to
have you around.

641
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:08,656
I'm not asking you
to be my minion.

642
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:12,285
How about it?
Sounds fun?

643
00:56:13,327 --> 00:56:14,662
- But in exchange...
- Bro...

644
00:56:17,498 --> 00:56:19,083
I'm a cop.

645
00:56:24,338 --> 00:56:26,424
<i>127 days after release</i>

646
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:28,175
What happened?

647
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:30,011
- We lost his signal.
- What?

648
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:32,930
Is the cover blown?

649
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:36,225
I don't think so,
his watch must be busted.

650
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,226
Play it.

651
00:56:40,646 --> 00:56:44,567
<i>I don't know
what you've heard,</i>

652
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:49,906
<i>I only unloaded 200 boxes
of king crabs that day.</i>

653
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:55,494
The chairman and I didn't see
eye to eye recently,

654
00:56:56,037 --> 00:57:00,917
but I'm not someone
who'd cause stink over it.

655
00:57:15,222 --> 00:57:16,974
Could I make a call?

656
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:17,934
Go ahead.

657
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:21,604
You have that right.

658
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,482
Who's that?

659
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:29,195
Choi Dae-hyun, 45,
12 violent crimes, and...

660
00:57:29,445 --> 00:57:30,488
Cnt. Choi?

661
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:32,323
Jesus Christ...

662
00:57:33,532 --> 00:57:36,035
He's a professional criminal.

663
00:57:36,243 --> 00:57:39,246
He's too big of a foe
for Jo to tackle alone.

664
00:57:39,538 --> 00:57:40,414
What's the backstory?

665
00:57:40,665 --> 00:57:44,710
Ko smuggled in a few seals
for forging export documents,

666
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:46,921
and Choi must've
intercepted them.

667
00:57:48,005 --> 00:57:49,090
What seals?

668
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:52,843
Busan Customs and
Harbor Master seals are verified.

669
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:55,763
The customs folks will go
batshit crazy.

670
00:57:56,305 --> 00:57:57,431
Shouldn't we swoop in?

671
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:02,520
And abandon 3-year
undercover work?

672
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:15,533
This is the chairman's
final proposal.

673
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:20,413
Come on,
what's with you?

674
00:58:20,621 --> 00:58:22,456
I don't have those seals!

675
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:26,794
If you see the number,
you'll kiss my feet.

676
00:58:27,628 --> 00:58:28,796
Wow.

677
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:33,467
You joke well
for such a pretty boy.

678
00:58:33,592 --> 00:58:35,428
Am I laughing?

679
00:59:10,212 --> 00:59:11,464
Let's begin.

680
00:59:12,214 --> 00:59:14,967
What's the rush?

681
00:59:16,469 --> 00:59:19,472
Why are you so antsy
like a pissy dog?

682
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:22,516
We gotta get them
all at once.

683
00:59:25,227 --> 00:59:30,441
Dude, are you worried
about your protege?

684
00:59:48,292 --> 00:59:49,293
Bastard!

685
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:51,587
Get him!

686
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:59,178
Go away!

687
01:00:01,597 --> 01:00:02,598
Don't come closer!

688
01:00:07,645 --> 01:00:10,356

691
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:31,168
Hey!

692
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:33,671
What is it?

693
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:36,298
Gonna work?

694
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:38,801
It's fun to work
once in a while.

695
01:00:39,051 --> 01:00:39,927
Dude!

696
01:00:49,603 --> 01:00:50,771
Everyone?

697
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:52,565
Have fun!

698
01:01:16,088 --> 01:01:18,674
Baby! I'm home!

699
01:01:50,164 --> 01:01:50,915
Come on in.

700
01:03:09,743 --> 01:03:11,704
Hey, stop!
Don't do it! Please!

701
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:24,675
Dammit!

702
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:26,760
I almost got hurt.

703
01:03:27,886 --> 01:03:29,346
And I almost died.

704
01:03:31,181 --> 01:03:32,850
Get him off of me.

705
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:35,477
Help me up.

706
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:37,771
<i>You gotta get him off
so I can help.</i>

707
01:03:37,771 --> 01:03:40,524
<i>I can get him off
only if you get me up.</i>

708
01:03:41,066 --> 01:03:42,609
<i>Oh, for fuck's sake!</i>

709
01:03:56,165 --> 01:03:57,166
Stay back!

710
01:04:00,836 --> 01:04:03,005
Don't come!
Stay back!

711
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:04,715
This isn't right...

712
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:37,748
We got the seals and took care
of Choi thanks to Hyun-su.

713
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:39,208
Good work.

714
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:41,126
This job was fun.

715
01:04:41,752 --> 01:04:42,836
Fun?

716
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:47,174
Did he just say it was fun?

717
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:50,260
He...

718
01:04:53,013 --> 01:04:54,932
A barrel of fun!

719
01:06:04,751 --> 01:06:06,170
Good to see you.

720
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:15,637
Fun place, eh?

721
01:06:20,934 --> 01:06:21,768
Hey.

722
01:07:00,974 --> 01:07:03,101
Mr. Gegard is waiting for you.

723
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:07,940
Cheers!

724
01:07:11,818 --> 01:07:12,819
Stay put.

725
01:07:41,765 --> 01:07:43,934
It's been a while,
Mr. Gegard.

726
01:07:45,018 --> 01:07:47,104
Good to see you, Mr. Han.

727
01:08:26,101 --> 01:08:27,269
Are you nuts?

728
01:08:27,811 --> 01:08:28,979
Why the fuck are you here?

729
01:08:29,104 --> 01:08:31,523
You look dope.

730
01:08:33,483 --> 01:08:35,152
Be careful with this one.

731
01:08:35,777 --> 01:08:37,946
I'm so fucking moved.

732
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:41,575
It feels like
I'm being watched too.

733
01:08:43,160 --> 01:08:45,203
Choi is still unconscious.

734
01:08:45,203 --> 01:08:47,497
Do you even know
what we did to cover it up?

735
01:08:47,497 --> 01:08:49,207
Then send me back in!

736
01:08:49,207 --> 01:08:51,084
- You bitch!
- Jo Hyun-su!

737
01:08:51,918 --> 01:08:53,086
Jo Hyun-su!

738
01:08:55,797 --> 01:08:57,215
Fucking bastard!

739
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:04,848
What's going on?

740
01:09:05,724 --> 01:09:08,560
The toilet was nasty
so I came out for a leak,

741
01:09:08,602 --> 01:09:11,313
then this perverted fuck
got a peek.

742
01:09:13,982 --> 01:09:15,233
Jesus!

743
01:09:15,525 --> 01:09:18,528
This may be a progressive society,
but that's not right.

744
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:20,614
I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

745
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:22,115
I didn't peek on purpose...

746
01:09:22,574 --> 01:09:24,534
Fucking pervert.

747
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:28,038
You picked the wrong dick

748
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:30,999
to play peeping tom on.

749
01:09:31,124 --> 01:09:33,043
- Bro! Stop!
- Fucking pervert!

750
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:34,920
Enough, that's enough.

751
01:09:35,087 --> 01:09:37,172
- Let's just go.
- Pull your click out!

752
01:09:37,172 --> 01:09:38,965
Let's take a look
at yours.

753
01:09:42,969 --> 01:09:44,930
Did you see
that cop's face?

754
01:09:45,597 --> 01:09:47,891
He was scared
out of his wits!

755
01:09:52,270 --> 01:09:55,107
I feel bad for
making him a pervert.

756
01:10:06,201 --> 01:10:07,160
Why...

757
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,248
did he show up
all of a sudden?

758
01:10:11,832 --> 01:10:13,208
The busted watch.

759
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:20,424
What are you doing?!

760
01:10:20,549 --> 01:10:22,008
Hold still, asshole!

761
01:10:24,636 --> 01:10:27,139
Hold it, stay put!

762
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:31,226
Hands up,
both of them!

763
01:10:56,418 --> 01:10:59,004
Are you happy now?

764
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:08,054
Fucking hell!

765
01:11:45,759 --> 01:11:48,428
I got started here
at your age.

766
01:11:49,930 --> 01:11:51,223
Do you know

767
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:56,102
how many have betrayed me
in those years?

768
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:04,361
Even the boss
I dedicated 20 years to

769
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:08,365
is trying to backstab me
with a smile on his face.

770
01:12:09,282 --> 01:12:14,079
Do you think I'm capable of
trusting someone?

771
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:24,506
Fine, I get it.

772
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:29,386
I'll never tell you
to trust me again.

773
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:31,221
Jeez“.

774
01:12:37,018 --> 01:12:38,728
But I trust you though.

775
01:12:51,408 --> 01:12:53,451
This place is so tacky.

776
01:12:56,746 --> 01:13:00,292
You made it big.

777
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:07,716
Big?

778
01:13:14,598 --> 01:13:16,474
It's a new sample.

779
01:13:16,683 --> 01:13:21,104
Half the cost and 90% purity
by improving formula.

780
01:13:21,354 --> 01:13:24,900
If this wasn't illegal,
it's Nobel Prize worthy.

781
01:13:26,443 --> 01:13:28,945
Just need to set up
the D-Day, uncle.

782
01:13:29,946 --> 01:13:32,198
Let's go big with this one.

783
01:13:32,324 --> 01:13:33,450
Quantity?

784
01:13:34,492 --> 01:13:37,203
We're thinking about 50kg.

785
01:13:37,454 --> 01:13:38,330
50?

786
01:13:39,331 --> 01:13:42,042
If we expand distribution,
we can cover the country.

787
01:13:42,375 --> 01:13:44,336
Coming up with that money
will take a month.

788
01:13:44,377 --> 01:13:48,131
Come on, God created
the world in 6 days.

789
01:13:48,965 --> 01:13:52,969
Chief Cheon will get a whiff
and come after us.

790
01:13:57,265 --> 01:13:58,475
There is a way.

791
01:14:00,060 --> 01:14:01,353
What's the plan?

792
01:14:02,187 --> 01:14:04,940
What about the po-po?
Will you use him?

793
01:14:05,649 --> 01:14:06,900
Keep it down.

794
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:12,989
Girls, this man
hangs out with a cop!

795
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:21,706
You still haven't told me
how you did it.

796
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:24,376
Did what?

797
01:14:25,126 --> 01:14:28,505
Your protege,
how did you bait him?

798
01:14:33,468 --> 01:14:34,844
About that Jo Hyun-su?

799
01:14:35,011 --> 01:14:37,138
That bastard really was with
the Golden Crane gang.

800
01:14:38,556 --> 01:14:41,351
But the thing is...

801
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:45,271
Tada!

802
01:14:47,232 --> 01:14:51,069
I went through so much
trouble for this.

803
01:14:51,695 --> 01:14:56,408
I was gonna track Cheon
and rape that bitch.

804
01:14:56,908 --> 01:14:57,867
Look.

805
01:14:58,618 --> 01:15:01,371
Then I got this photo.
Take a look.

806
01:15:02,372 --> 01:15:03,415
Chief Cheon.

807
01:15:03,915 --> 01:15:06,084
I took care of the bastard
beside her.

808
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:10,463
So get this kid from in here.

809
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:12,841
That's the best way.

810
01:15:18,638 --> 01:15:23,852
Cops are even more
conniving than us!

811
01:15:27,522 --> 01:15:28,440
What?

812
01:15:29,232 --> 01:15:30,900
He's too good to bury.

813
01:15:32,736 --> 01:15:35,071
You got a boner for him?

814
01:15:37,323 --> 01:15:38,950
I'll try to bait him
to our side.

815
01:15:40,368 --> 01:15:43,747
He's a cop!
How do you bait a cop?

816
01:15:43,830 --> 01:15:45,915
I got my ways.

817
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:59,137
I'll give it a try,

818
01:16:01,765 --> 01:16:02,766
if not,

819
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:05,643
I'll wrap things up.

820
01:16:06,686 --> 01:16:07,604
Bro.

821
01:16:08,521 --> 01:16:09,773
I'm a cop.

822
01:16:14,778 --> 01:16:16,946
I know what I'm doing
is crazy.

823
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:20,241
I know you can snap
my neck right now.

824
01:16:26,956 --> 01:16:29,250
But I don't think I should
deceive you anymore.

825
01:16:36,508 --> 01:16:37,592
<i>I'm sorry, bro.</i>

826
01:16:39,385 --> 01:16:42,097
So that idiot came clean
on his own?

827
01:16:43,431 --> 01:16:44,474
How did you do it?

828
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:47,519
Spill it.

829
01:16:47,644 --> 01:16:48,812
He's a good kid.

830
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:54,442
You and I will never
understand that.

831
01:17:07,622 --> 01:17:09,874
<i>Jung Kyung-hee's Tree
1962-2014</i>

832
01:17:37,610 --> 01:17:38,486
Who are you?

833
01:17:39,571 --> 01:17:40,238
Who the hell are you?!

834
01:17:40,488 --> 01:17:42,323
Yo, [JO-PO-

835
01:17:45,618 --> 01:17:47,745
Po-po? What the shit?

836
01:17:47,745 --> 01:17:49,914
Han Jae-ho gave you up.

837
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:50,957
What?

838
01:17:51,541 --> 01:17:54,419
Who do you think
greenlit you?

839
01:17:57,297 --> 01:17:58,381
Get the gasoline.

840
01:18:03,261 --> 01:18:04,095
Pour it.

841
01:18:18,693 --> 01:18:22,614
Any last words?
You got 5 seconds.

842
01:18:23,781 --> 01:18:25,158
- 5!
- Wait! Wait!

843
01:18:25,158 --> 01:18:26,701
- 4!
- Wait!

844
01:18:26,701 --> 01:18:27,702
- 3!
- How did he know?!

845
01:18:27,827 --> 01:18:30,121
- How did Han know that?!
- 2! 1!

846
01:18:53,519 --> 01:18:54,562
Loyalty check?

847
01:18:57,815 --> 01:18:58,942
Loyalty check!

848
01:19:00,735 --> 01:19:03,780
As if sending me
to the joint wasn't enough,

849
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:06,741
now you'll burn me alive too?

850
01:19:10,203 --> 01:19:11,579
Yo, pervert.

851
01:19:12,789 --> 01:19:15,166
Feels good to
get your revenge?

852
01:19:15,959 --> 01:19:18,169
You sound like
a real gangster now.

853
01:19:18,169 --> 01:19:20,838
If you serve 3 years,
you'll be too, asshole.

854
01:19:21,422 --> 01:19:22,340
Son of a bitch...

855
01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:23,508
Hey, hey.

856
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,056
Is the D-Day set?

857
01:19:32,308 --> 01:19:34,394
Han is trying to
convince the chairman.

858
01:19:34,769 --> 01:19:37,772
Once Ko's on board,
Russians will set a date.

859
01:19:39,524 --> 01:19:40,775
Quantity?

860
01:19:41,317 --> 01:19:42,443
About 50.

861
01:19:48,741 --> 01:19:50,952
Any leads on mom's
hit-and-run case?

862
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:55,748
It takes time, but most
hit-and-runs get solved.

863
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:58,126
We're pressuring
those in charge,

864
01:19:58,793 --> 01:20:00,086
let's wait and see.

865
01:20:13,766 --> 01:20:17,895
<i>1 year ago, the day of
Hyun-su's mother's death</i>

866
01:20:22,859 --> 01:20:24,402
We have to let him know.

867
01:20:24,736 --> 01:20:25,695
If he knew,

868
01:20:26,321 --> 01:20:28,531
would that bring her back?

869
01:20:31,367 --> 01:20:35,371
Chief, we may work
off the books, but this is...

870
01:20:36,289 --> 01:20:38,041
Goddamn fucking shit!

871
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:54,932
Buddy!

872
01:20:55,850 --> 01:20:56,976
Listen carefully.

873
01:20:59,145 --> 01:21:02,231
No one's at fault
until it's discovered.

874
01:21:04,192 --> 01:21:08,404
The one who's victimized
is at fault.

875
01:21:11,157 --> 01:21:13,951
There's no room for
half-assed guilty conscience.

876
01:21:15,953 --> 01:21:18,373
Or you'll end up
destroying yourself.

877
01:21:29,759 --> 01:21:30,927
What's going on here?

878
01:21:31,761 --> 01:21:34,305
Are you putting on
a show or something?

879
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:36,974
What happened to you?

880
01:21:42,188 --> 01:21:44,399
It's a long story.

881
01:21:45,483 --> 01:21:46,442
Let's go.

882
01:22:25,481 --> 01:22:26,482
Bro.

883
01:22:27,525 --> 01:22:29,235
Aren't you sick of
living like this?

884
01:22:29,944 --> 01:22:30,987
Like what?

885
01:22:31,821 --> 01:22:37,660
Sometimes I pity
your lifestyle.

886
01:22:39,829 --> 01:22:43,624
I don't mean to live like this.
I live like this just to get by.

887
01:22:45,001 --> 01:22:47,628
The events that unfold
in your life

888
01:22:48,171 --> 01:22:50,756
usually come from behind.

889
01:22:51,674 --> 01:22:53,843
Never from the front.

890
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:55,845
So you must...

891
01:22:57,513 --> 01:22:59,640
constantly watch your back.

892
01:23:02,435 --> 01:23:03,686
Indeed,

893
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:08,191
I never expected my morn
to end up like that.

894
01:23:11,736 --> 01:23:15,907
But you wouldn't be
beside me now.

01:24:19,554 --> 01:24:20,596

<i>this is a blockbuster.</i>

901
01:24:28,479 --> 01:24:30,856

905
01:26:24,178 --> 01:26:25,012

Very nice.

01:26:52,123 --> 01:26:53,791
Been a while,
Chairman Ko!

908
01:27:00,881 --> 01:27:04,844
Get on your knees,
motherfuckers!

909
01:27:09,932 --> 01:27:11,809
What the shit?
Stop them!

910
01:27:20,276 --> 01:27:22,278
Retrieve the boxes!

911
01:27:30,119 --> 01:27:34,165
Your joints aren't what
they used to be, you okay?

912
01:27:36,167 --> 01:27:37,001
Open them.

913
01:27:48,763 --> 01:27:50,598
Wonderful toys!

914
01:27:50,848 --> 01:27:52,475
Very good choice.

915
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:24,590
These sailors
must've been lonely.

916
01:28:25,257 --> 01:28:27,092
With my respect,
Chief Cheon.

917
01:28:28,636 --> 01:28:29,845
Let's go, Mr. Gegard!

918
01:28:42,775 --> 01:28:43,943
Fuck“.

919
01:28:59,166 --> 01:29:02,795
So the salt takes 2 hours
to melt in the water?

920
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:05,714
It should be done by now.

921
01:29:06,090 --> 01:29:07,049
Okay, okay-

922
01:29:07,299 --> 01:29:12,054
Jo Hyun-su is a smart kid,
maybe because he's young.

923
01:29:14,014 --> 01:29:16,809
The way you planted intel
to Cheon was,

924
01:29:18,227 --> 01:29:19,520
by any chance...

925
01:29:21,063 --> 01:29:24,441
Curiosity killed the cat,
I planted it.

926
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:30,322
It's all there.
We confirmed the cash.

927
01:29:30,447 --> 01:29:34,201
Now let's check
the merchandise.

928
01:29:42,459 --> 01:29:43,586
Verified.

929
01:29:44,044 --> 01:29:44,879
Good.

930
01:29:49,425 --> 01:29:51,302
A drink to our business!

931
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:54,305
Very good, thank you!

932
01:29:55,306 --> 01:29:56,307
Good work, Jae-ho.

933
01:29:56,765 --> 01:29:58,809
Let's drink till we drop!

934
01:30:00,728 --> 01:30:02,605
Cheers! Cheers!

935
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:08,861
Chairman.

936
01:30:10,362 --> 01:30:12,740
I don't drink with corpses.

937
01:30:14,491 --> 01:30:15,743
What should I do?

938
01:30:16,785 --> 01:30:18,037
Han.

939
01:30:21,415 --> 01:30:22,541
MY apologies.

940
01:30:23,417 --> 01:30:25,044
You fucking traitors!

941
01:30:27,463 --> 01:30:28,505
Fuck!

942
01:31:07,002 --> 01:31:08,712
Fish the merchandise
and head back.

943
01:31:09,004 --> 01:31:11,548
Take care of
your protege yourself.

944
01:31:14,009 --> 01:31:15,219
Look!

945
01:31:16,387 --> 01:31:17,763
He's not dead yet.

946
01:31:18,555 --> 01:31:20,182
Good work!

947
01:31:21,392 --> 01:31:22,518
Is he one of ours?

948
01:31:57,928 --> 01:31:58,929
You Okay?

949
01:32:02,057 --> 01:32:03,183
It fucking hurts, right?

950
01:32:03,559 --> 01:32:06,061
It hurts like a motherfucker!

951
01:32:06,812 --> 01:32:08,564
Must we go this far?

952
01:32:13,444 --> 01:32:14,611
Again?

953
01:32:16,113 --> 01:32:18,157
You're a fucking psycho.

954
01:32:29,626 --> 01:32:32,379
Her man got shot during op,

955
01:32:33,672 --> 01:32:36,383
but the chief is
nowhere in sight.

956
01:32:43,766 --> 01:32:44,975
Bring Jo in.

957
01:32:45,768 --> 01:32:48,395
<i>He got shot twice,
he's being treated right now.</i>

958
01:32:48,479 --> 01:32:50,355
He wasn't shot in the head!

959
01:33:08,457 --> 01:33:09,541
What is this?

960
01:34:03,804 --> 01:34:05,597
Doesn't he look familiar?

961
01:34:22,030 --> 01:34:23,115
Why...

962
01:34:23,907 --> 01:34:25,701
why didn't you tell me?

963
01:34:26,201 --> 01:34:27,536
Why didn't you?!

964
01:34:27,578 --> 01:34:30,414
I thought you'd
fuck up the operation.

965
01:34:30,664 --> 01:34:31,957
It's all gone to shit anyway.

966
01:34:34,751 --> 01:34:36,128
Why are you
doing this to me?

967
01:34:37,671 --> 01:34:38,255
Be cool!

968
01:34:38,297 --> 01:34:39,506
Fucking bitch!

969
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:41,341
Why are you
doing this to me?

970
01:34:41,425 --> 01:34:42,634
You know fully well.

971
01:34:43,760 --> 01:34:45,888
Will you let your
mom's killer walk free?

972
01:34:47,639 --> 01:34:48,599
Calm down.

973
01:34:51,518 --> 01:34:55,731
But you wouldn't be
beside me now.

974
01:35:00,402 --> 01:35:01,695
Stop! Stop!

975
01:35:02,613 --> 01:35:04,239
No way!

976
01:35:22,299 --> 01:35:23,926
The moral of this story is

977
01:35:25,719 --> 01:35:27,679
don't trust people.

978
01:35:29,514 --> 01:35:31,058
Trust the circumstances.

979
01:35:32,684 --> 01:35:33,977
The circumstances.

980
01:35:43,612 --> 01:35:44,529
We are!

981
01:35:44,613 --> 01:35:46,406
Family!

982
01:36:01,088 --> 01:36:02,547
My friend is a made man!

983
01:36:05,050 --> 01:36:05,968
Move!

984
01:36:06,927 --> 01:36:09,137
Let's drink!

985
01:36:11,515 --> 01:36:12,349
Thank you, sir.

986
01:36:18,438 --> 01:36:19,106
Bud.

987
01:36:19,231 --> 01:36:22,109
Co-bosses are common nowadays.

988
01:36:24,111 --> 01:36:25,946
Let's not do that though.

989
01:36:28,699 --> 01:36:29,992
- We are!
- Family!

990
01:36:40,502 --> 01:36:42,713
Are you okay to contact
so quickly?

991
01:36:43,422 --> 01:36:44,298
<i>Bro.</i>

992
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:49,344
<i>I'm getting investigated,
you're in danger too.</i>

993
01:36:52,097 --> 01:36:53,515
What do you mean?

994
01:36:53,765 --> 01:36:54,933
I think someone gave me up.

995
01:36:57,394 --> 01:36:59,730
Is there anyone
who knows about my cover?

996
01:37:07,738 --> 01:37:10,490
<i>A raid warrant will be
issued tomorrow.</i>

997
01:37:11,575 --> 01:37:13,535
<i>We gotta grab our shit
and skip town today.</i>

998
01:37:16,913 --> 01:37:19,833
I'll give you the time later,
meet me at our spot.

999
01:37:28,175 --> 01:37:29,343
<i>Okay, see you then.</i>

1000
01:37:32,929 --> 01:37:34,222
Shouldn't we request backup?

1001
01:37:34,222 --> 01:37:36,933
No, if we request another one,
we'll get pulled off this.

1002
01:37:36,933 --> 01:37:38,060
Our target is
just Han Jae-ho.

1003
01:37:38,143 --> 01:37:39,895
How many men
can we get quietly?

1004
01:37:40,187 --> 01:37:41,229
About three.

1005
01:37:41,313 --> 01:37:42,731
Will he really come?

1006
01:38:10,300 --> 01:38:11,301
Eh?

1007
01:38:12,928 --> 01:38:14,596
He called me down,
but he's gone?

1008
01:38:23,897 --> 01:38:25,524
CEO.

1009
01:38:30,529 --> 01:38:32,781
Dope, that's so dope.

1010
01:38:50,841 --> 01:38:51,842
Go take care of it.

1011
01:39:07,065 --> 01:39:08,275
Hey, Jae-ho!

1012
01:39:25,167 --> 01:39:26,293
Jae-ho...

1013
01:39:28,879 --> 01:39:30,881
Jo Hyun-su, that fuck...

1014
01:39:31,756 --> 01:39:33,175
I'm gonna kill him...

1015
01:39:34,843 --> 01:39:36,052
Jae-ho...

1016
01:39:38,597 --> 01:39:39,764
You can't do this.

1017
01:39:43,143 --> 01:39:45,979
You're not seeing things
straight, asshole!

1018
01:39:49,858 --> 01:39:51,109
Bud...

1019
01:39:53,111 --> 01:39:54,654
Snap out of it!

1020
01:39:55,155 --> 01:39:56,448
Son of a bitch...

1021
01:40:06,875 --> 01:40:11,087
You're not a friend,
goddammit...

1022
01:40:11,922 --> 01:40:13,757
Motherfucker!

1023
01:40:27,604 --> 01:40:28,855
Jae-ho...

1024
01:40:32,943 --> 01:40:36,613
This is all wrong, asshole!

1025
01:40:36,947 --> 01:40:39,783
Snap out of it!

1026
01:41:06,226 --> 01:41:07,435
Young-geun.

1027
01:41:08,478 --> 01:41:10,689
Aren't you sick
of living like this?

1028
01:41:14,943 --> 01:41:16,111
Leave me.

1029
01:42:55,293 --> 01:42:56,378
What's with him?

1030
01:43:20,402 --> 01:43:21,861
Did you wait long?

1031
01:43:24,781 --> 01:43:26,282
I'm late.

1032
01:43:29,327 --> 01:43:30,453
Hey.

1033
01:43:31,121 --> 01:43:34,249
Did you see the rain?

1034
01:43:34,916 --> 01:43:36,209
It's insane.

1035
01:43:38,753 --> 01:43:40,588
How are you feeling?

1036
01:43:43,341 --> 01:43:47,178
You shot me,
you know how I am.

1037
01:43:54,436 --> 01:43:56,771
You've done so much.

1038
01:43:59,858 --> 01:44:01,317
On the way here,

1039
01:44:02,277 --> 01:44:07,323
I spotted a weird water truck
among abandoned cars.

1040
01:44:07,323 --> 01:44:08,700
Dammit...

1041
01:44:08,908 --> 01:44:15,582
<i>Do mineral water trucks
tint the windows that dark?</i>

1042
01:44:19,210 --> 01:44:21,296
Are you still
suspicious of me?

1043
01:44:31,055 --> 01:44:32,307
Pat me down.

1044
01:44:44,819 --> 01:44:46,237
I'm sick of it.

1045
01:44:47,822 --> 01:44:49,324
Living this life.

1046
01:44:51,159 --> 01:44:52,327
Hyun-su.

1047
01:44:52,994 --> 01:44:57,582
Should we sell the drugs
and leave this business?

1048
01:45:03,588 --> 01:45:04,756
Nope.

1049
01:45:06,299 --> 01:45:08,802
There's no other work
that you're fit for.

1050
01:45:10,970 --> 01:45:14,432
Kill the backstabber,
kill the competition,

1051
01:45:14,808 --> 01:45:16,351
kill anyone you dislike.

1052
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:22,315
Is Mr. Ko still alive?

1053
01:45:30,323 --> 01:45:32,492
I heard you killed
my mom too.

1054
01:46:01,020 --> 01:46:02,313
It's true that

1055
01:46:05,817 --> 01:46:07,402
I can't see straight anymore...

1056
01:46:09,362 --> 01:46:10,446
Right.

1057
01:46:11,656 --> 01:46:16,286
I should've killed you
from the get-go.

1058
01:46:18,580 --> 01:46:19,789
I should have.

1059
01:46:30,341 --> 01:46:31,926
Fuck“.

1060
01:46:36,347 --> 01:46:37,557
You should've

1061
01:46:39,183 --> 01:46:40,435
never

1062
01:46:42,812 --> 01:46:44,480
found out.

1063
01:46:47,191 --> 01:46:48,443
Come on.

1064
01:46:51,279 --> 01:46:53,448
Can't shoot me out of pity?

1065
01:47:06,377 --> 01:47:08,171
If you're gonna shoot,
make it fast.

1066
01:47:08,713 --> 01:47:10,798
Po-pos will be here soon.

1067
01:47:20,892 --> 01:47:22,185
The plan was,

1068
01:47:23,895 --> 01:47:26,230
after verifying
the merchandise outside,

1069
01:47:26,898 --> 01:47:28,942
I wanted to ambush you.

1070
01:47:30,526 --> 01:47:31,945
I ruined the plan again.

1071
01:47:50,964 --> 01:47:52,256
Goddammit!

1072
01:48:12,735 --> 01:48:14,278
Where's Han Jae-ho?

1073
01:48:46,394 --> 01:48:48,563
Son of a bitch!
Where are you?!

1074
01:48:49,230 --> 01:48:50,690
Come out!

1075
01:49:10,626 --> 01:49:11,919
Give me the gun.

1076
01:49:12,503 --> 01:49:13,546
That's how you live.

1077
01:49:17,216 --> 01:49:20,678
Son of a bitch,
you wanna die?

1078
01:49:21,220 --> 01:49:23,806
He's not someone
you can handle.

1079
01:49:58,007 --> 01:49:59,092
Scared?

1080
01:49:59,509 --> 01:50:00,593
Shut the hell up!

1081
01:50:16,734 --> 01:50:19,862
Fuck, what are you
trying to pull?

1082
01:50:48,182 --> 01:50:50,351
If you don't kill me,
you're a dead man.

1083
01:51:25,386 --> 01:51:27,763
<i>I started out here
when I was your age.</i>

1084
01:51:29,557 --> 01:51:30,850
<i>Do you know</i>

1085
01:51:32,226 --> 01:51:35,521
<i>how many have betrayed me
in those years?</i>

1086
01:51:36,606 --> 01:51:38,191
<i>Fine, I get it.</i>

1087
01:51:38,691 --> 01:51:42,612
<i>I'll never tell you
to trust me again.</i>

1088
01:51:45,323 --> 01:51:47,116
<i>But I trust you though.</i>

1089
01:51:50,077 --> 01:51:50,995
<i>Bro.</i>
