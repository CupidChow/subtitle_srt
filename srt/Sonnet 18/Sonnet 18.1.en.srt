1
00:00:44,517 --> 00:00:46,420
Seungmin…

2
00:00:47,337 --> 00:00:48,892
Man and woman, masquerade…

3
00:00:50,413 --> 00:00:51,343
Fine.

4
00:00:51,758 --> 00:00:54,992
But your scenario...

5
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:58,833
I think it's not honest.

6
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:01,196
You know what I mean?

7
00:01:01,851 --> 00:01:04,540
Plot is good, characters are great. But...

8
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,578
I thinks it is not your story.

9
00:01:11,246 --> 00:01:14,516
I can't find yours in this scenario.
Nowhere.

10
00:01:18,903 --> 00:01:21,023
Could you be more honest?

11
00:01:40,548 --> 00:01:44,406
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

12
00:01:46,497 --> 00:01:50,258
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

13
00:01:53,598 --> 00:01:57,598
Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May

14
00:01:59,362 --> 00:02:03,906
and summer's lease hath
all too short a date.

15
00:02:07,195 --> 00:02:11,659
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,

16
00:02:15,054 --> 00:02:18,047
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,

17
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:25,203
so long as men can breathe or eyes can see,

18
00:02:27,002 --> 00:02:32,219
so long lives this
and this gives life to thee.

19
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:46,773
I like Shakespeare.

20
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,019
So do I.

21
00:02:59,384 --> 00:03:04,078
Shakespeare wrote this poem
for a boy whom he loved, right?

22
00:03:05,297 --> 00:03:07,760
Maybe? Why?

23
00:03:08,338 --> 00:03:11,937
Nothing. I just want
to write great like him.

24
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:17,797
Can poet write a scenario?

25
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,279
I'll stay at home for days.

26
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,617
I want to write good scenario
like movies what I loved.

27
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:36,716
What did she say?

28
00:03:37,991 --> 00:03:39,305
"Write honest."

29
00:03:40,693 --> 00:03:45,685
How did she know you wrote honest or not?

30
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:49,763
Maybe, it showed up on my writes.

31
00:03:51,997 --> 00:03:55,430
So, didn't you write honest?

32
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:04,857
I don't know.

33
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,672
Read it.

34
00:04:36,927 --> 00:04:38,031
You're already leaving?

35
00:07:57,549 --> 00:08:00,182
What is this?

36
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,534
It's not funny, Jungsoo.

37
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:18,362
I have to write.

38
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,346
Wouldn't you put off your mask?

39
00:12:13,237 --> 00:12:16,674
Alright, as you like it…

40
00:12:33,028 --> 00:12:34,909
Have you done read?

41
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,745
How was it..?

42
00:12:47,824 --> 00:12:49,659
I've been told it's not honest.

43
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:58,354
Actually, I don't know
what is honest writing.

44
00:13:10,597 --> 00:13:11,729
What do I do?

45
00:13:14,005 --> 00:13:15,924
I can't even write a word…

46
00:13:31,424 --> 00:13:33,010
Last time, you said...

47
00:13:35,183 --> 00:13:38,721
You want to write great like Shakespeare.

48
00:13:43,655 --> 00:13:48,247
I think he was very honest on his mind.

49
00:13:49,974 --> 00:13:52,003
At least, about who himself was...

50
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:58,174
and about whom he loved.

51
00:14:06,352 --> 00:14:07,318
So what?

52
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:15,552
Are you honest on yourself?

53
00:14:25,838 --> 00:14:30,943
What is honest?

54
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:45,755
Then are you honest on yourself?

55
00:14:53,812 --> 00:14:55,549
You don't even put off your mask.

56
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:01,057
What...

57
00:15:05,933 --> 00:15:07,815
What all this mean?

58
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:15,901
Why are you doing this to me?

59
00:15:35,662 --> 00:15:41,138
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

60
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,404
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

61
00:15:55,335 --> 00:16:00,893
Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May,

62
00:16:05,418 --> 00:16:11,276
and summer's lease hath
all too short a date.

63
00:16:16,717 --> 00:16:20,157
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,

64
00:16:23,809 --> 00:16:29,526
when in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,

65
00:16:33,391 --> 00:16:38,604
so long as men can breathe
or eyes can see,

66
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:48,026
so long lives this,
and this gives life to thee.

67
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:25,984
Well...

68
00:18:28,717 --> 00:18:30,957
I liked what you wrote.

69
00:18:41,144 --> 00:18:42,177
To be honest...

70
00:18:46,622 --> 00:18:48,832
I know well.

71
00:18:51,975 --> 00:18:59,544
I know whom I love and who I am...

72
00:19:02,202 --> 00:19:03,294
but...

73
00:19:08,363 --> 00:19:12,646
but I am so afraid.

74
00:19:56,097 --> 00:19:57,419
Let's go dance.

75
00:20:05,957 --> 00:20:08,687
It's a masquerade.

76
00:22:35,992 --> 00:22:38,609
Are you done writing?

77
00:22:40,222 --> 00:22:41,476
Almost?

78
00:22:43,573 --> 00:22:46,914
How's it? Satisfied?

79
00:22:50,252 --> 00:22:52,662
I guess?

80
00:23:21,656 --> 00:23:22,891
Seungmin,

81
00:23:24,062 --> 00:23:26,386
why the characters are gay this time?

82
00:23:26,936 --> 00:23:29,492
Because it's popular? Or it sells well?

83
00:23:31,371 --> 00:23:32,203
It's not that…

84
00:23:32,228 --> 00:23:33,018
And...

85
00:23:33,418 --> 00:23:37,945
I think it is just happy
with this kind of theme.

86
00:23:44,827 --> 00:23:45,817
Well...

87
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:53,805
I am gay.

88
00:23:56,422 --> 00:23:59,039
The characters are me and my boyfriend.

89
00:24:02,356 --> 00:24:03,539
And we are happy.

90
00:24:14,427 --> 00:24:18,874
Sorry, Seungmin. It was your story.

91
00:24:22,347 --> 00:24:24,907
You said “be honest”.

92
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:51,586
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

93
00:24:54,137 --> 00:24:57,343
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

94
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,601
Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May,

95
00:25:07,609 --> 00:25:10,023
and summer's lease hath
all too short a date.

96
00:25:13,113 --> 00:25:18,282
Sometimes too hot the eye of heaven shines.

97
00:25:20,456 --> 00:25:23,797
And often is his hold complexion dimmed.

98
00:25:26,246 --> 00:25:32,506
And every fair from fair sometimes declines.

99
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:40,758
By chance or nature's
changing course untrimmed.

100
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:46,703
But thy eternal summer shall not fade,

101
00:25:49,146 --> 00:25:52,222
nor lose possession of that
fair thous ow'st,

102
00:25:54,673 --> 00:26:01,000
nor shall death brag thou
wander'st in his shade.

103
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:07,406
When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,

104
00:26:09,931 --> 00:26:15,062
so long as men can breath or eyes can see,

105
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:23,398
so long lives this
and this gives life to thee.

106
00:26:26,422 --> 00:26:30,350
