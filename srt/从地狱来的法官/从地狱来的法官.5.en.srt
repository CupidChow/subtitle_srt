Isn't it problematic that nothing's wrong?

33
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:03,186
Test results show
there's nothing physically wrong.

34

if there's nothing wrong?

Have you experienced stress lately?

37
00:03:12,946 --> 00:03:15,782
Living among people
is stressful in itself.

38
00:03:16,908 --> 00:03:19,744
It's highly likely
that you experienced severe stress

39
00:03:19,828 --> 00:03:22,289
due to external stimuli
right before you fainted.

40
00:03:22,956 --> 00:03:25,333

There actually was great external stimuli.

Then it's best you avoid it.

What if I can't?

46
00:03:46,146 --> 00:03:47,689
You have to eliminate it.

47
00:03:48,857 --> 00:03:50,358
And if I can't do that either?

48
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:52,235

-Is she ill enough to need a wheelchair?
-[Mando] No, it's not that.

53
00:04:16,593 --> 00:04:18,553
She's only pretending to be a patient.

54
00:04:22,474 --> 00:04:24,601
How dare you come here?

55
00:04:25,435 --> 00:04:28,063

I wanted to drive her home.

something anyways. Let's go.

What did you mean?

You said you weren't
going to bother me anymore.

65
00:05:10,772 --> 00:05:14,568
And you didn't seem to care
when I told you things about Kang Bitna.

66
00:05:14,651 --> 00:05:16,361
So why are you curious about me again?

that foul mouth of yours at the hospital?

94
00:06:41,738 --> 00:06:45,116
Seems they didn't fix
your temper at the clinic either.

138
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:24,252
I don't know either.

139
00:10:24,336 --> 00:10:26,922
-How can I tell him when I don't know?
-What?

140
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:28,215
Ah.

141
00:10:29,508 --> 00:10:30,509
I know.

142
00:10:31,468 --> 00:10:34,179
Find out in detail
who Kang Bitna was and report to me.

143
00:10:34,804 --> 00:10:36,556
-Maybe he'll move out then.
-[Mando] But...

144
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,974
By the way, Justitia,

145
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,144
do you hate the detective
living next door that much?

146
00:10:41,228 --> 00:10:42,687
Who said I did?

147
00:10:43,438 --> 00:10:45,690
-Then do you like it?
-I didn't say that.

148
00:10:46,691 --> 00:10:48,318
Then why do you want him to go?

149
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:49,903
Do you have to ask?

150
00:10:49,986 --> 00:10:52,364
-Han Daon is suspecting me right now.
-Hmm.

151
00:10:52,906 --> 00:10:55,617
What would happen
if he secretly saw what I was doing?

152
00:10:56,326 --> 00:10:57,369
You'd be arrested.

153
00:10:57,452 --> 00:10:59,829
And get at least life imprisonment.
[chuckles]

154
00:10:59,913 --> 00:11:02,290
No one can catch me.

155
00:11:02,374 --> 00:11:05,669
Of course not. Then what's the problem
with him living next door?

156
00:11:06,711 --> 00:11:10,090
Just find it out as I say!
I need a reason to kick him out.

157
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:12,217
I see, a reason.

158
00:11:13,927 --> 00:11:16,346
Then I should find out about Kang Bitna.

159
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:17,806
How should I do it?

160
00:11:17,889 --> 00:11:19,808
Figure it out yourself. Now!

161
00:11:19,891 --> 00:11:22,227
Okay, got it. I will.

162
00:11:24,729 --> 00:11:26,815

I have something I must tell you.</i>

164
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,234
Where did she go?

165
00:12:18,241 --> 00:12:20,035
[sighing heavily]

166
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,810
How did you lose that detective?

167
00:12:45,894 --> 00:12:49,189
-With my innate agility and athleticism.
-[chuckles]

168
00:12:50,982 --> 00:12:54,444
But that Han Daon
keeps getting on my nerves.

169
00:12:54,528 --> 00:12:56,238
Should I teach him a lesson?

170
00:12:56,321 --> 00:12:59,908
Not too harshly. Just enough for him
to be bed-ridden for months.

171
00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:03,078
It's fine. Just do your job.

172
00:13:03,161 --> 00:13:05,372
You need to kill two in Uijeongbu, too.

173
00:13:05,455 --> 00:13:06,581
[Arong] Justitia.

174
00:13:07,207 --> 00:13:09,209
Can you go somewhere with me this weekend?

175
00:13:10,168 --> 00:13:11,211
No, I'm tired.

176
00:13:11,294 --> 00:13:13,296
Come on, come with me.

177
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,965
It's a very important meeting.

178
00:13:16,758 --> 00:13:17,884
What is it?

Demons dispatched to Seoul and Gyeonggi
meet regularly to exchange information.

To find out if anyone's seen
a suspicious human who might be Satan.

What's the point of finding them now?

184
00:13:36,862 --> 00:13:38,405
There is a point.

185
00:13:38,488 --> 00:13:41,700
If you can offer Satan and the Kylum
to Lucifer and Bael,

186
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,453
you'll be handsomely rewarded
and won't have to suffer here.

Judge Kang Bitna is a demon.

Why do you need to know that?

534
00:36:45,917 --> 00:36:46,918
Who are you?

535
00:36:47,002 --> 00:36:49,588
Me? I'm Koo Dowan.

536
00:36:51,673 --> 00:36:54,342
A long-time friend of Yang Seungbin.

537
00:36:56,011 --> 00:36:57,512
Okay, Koo Dowan.

538
00:37:00,015 --> 00:37:03,810
Yang Seungbin says he has no memory
of killing his wife and children.

539
00:37:04,728 --> 00:37:06,646
Then did you, Koo Dowan,

540
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:08,607
kill Yang Seungbin's family?

541
00:37:08,773 --> 00:37:09,774
[chuckles]

542
00:37:12,694 --> 00:37:14,196
I did.

543
00:37:15,071 --> 00:37:16,364
[chuckles manically]

544
00:37:16,448 --> 00:37:18,617
Why did you kill
your close friend's family?

545
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:21,912
Because they looked down on Seungbin.

546
00:37:21,995 --> 00:37:23,538
That day, too.

547
00:37:24,539 --> 00:37:26,958
<i>As always, Seungbin was...</i>

548
00:37:27,042 --> 00:37:29,336
Is he pretending or for real?

549
00:37:30,754 --> 00:37:34,466
She looked down on her husband
for not making enough money.

550
00:37:34,549 --> 00:37:36,551
His children are the same.

551
00:37:36,635 --> 00:37:39,846
Their dad should be able to hit them
if he gets angry.

552
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,431
"Don't hit me."

553
00:37:42,307 --> 00:37:44,309
Who are they to order him around?

554
00:37:44,392 --> 00:37:45,393
So...

555
00:37:46,311 --> 00:37:49,481
You brutally murdered
your friend's wife and young children?

556
00:37:49,564 --> 00:37:52,442
I'm sure Seungbin was a bit surprised.
[chuckling]

557
00:37:52,609 --> 00:37:54,152
Seungbin.

558
00:37:54,236 --> 00:37:58,532
He was crying like a fool.
[laughs]

559
00:38:01,076 --> 00:38:03,912
But he'll thank me in the end.

560
00:38:06,164 --> 00:38:09,918
If I hadn't done what I did,
he'd have been a doormat his whole life.

561
00:38:12,546 --> 00:38:14,506
Did you say Kim Seoyul?

562
00:38:14,589 --> 00:38:16,424
Can you tell me about Seoyul?

563
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:22,931
Was he there when Koo Dowan killed
Yang Seungbin's family?

564
00:38:23,598 --> 00:38:25,433
You don't need to listen to him.

565
00:38:31,523 --> 00:38:32,983
Yes, I...

566
00:38:34,067 --> 00:38:35,694
I was there, too.

567
00:38:35,777 --> 00:38:39,322
You were there,
so why didn't you stop Koo Dowan?

568
00:38:43,827 --> 00:38:45,203
[crying] I told him not to.

569
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,498
-<i>But...</i>
-[sighs heavily]

570
00:38:49,457 --> 00:38:52,168
[Seoyul crying] But he was so angry.

571
00:38:52,752 --> 00:38:54,421
And I was so scared.

572
00:38:55,463 --> 00:38:57,591
But I still should have stopped him.

573
00:39:02,095 --> 00:39:04,181
Shut up.

574
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,642
I'm sorry.

575
00:39:08,518 --> 00:39:09,603
Koo Dowan.

576
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,230
Get Yang Seungbin.

577
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:23,074
What do you want with that coward?

578
00:39:23,158 --> 00:39:28,246
Yang Seungbin's deceased wife and children
had suffered domestic violence.

579
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:31,416
The police were called several times.

580
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:34,127
Did you do all of that too?

581
00:39:34,211 --> 00:39:36,296
Yes, I hit them a few times.

582
00:39:37,297 --> 00:39:38,715
Is that so wrong?

583
00:39:39,758 --> 00:39:41,885
[Seoyul groans] Dowan.

584
00:39:42,677 --> 00:39:43,803
Don't do that.

585
00:39:45,013 --> 00:39:46,097
Haven't had enough?

586
00:39:46,181 --> 00:39:48,808
No, I...

587
00:39:50,268 --> 00:39:52,687
For your sake and mine...

588
00:39:52,771 --> 00:39:54,481
Stay quiet.

589
00:39:55,482 --> 00:39:56,983
Dowan, please...

590
00:39:57,484 --> 00:39:59,152
This is insane.

591
00:39:59,236 --> 00:40:03,490
Tell the officer you're sorry now.

592
00:40:03,573 --> 00:40:05,534
He might forgive you.

593
00:40:05,617 --> 00:40:06,618
Damn it!

594
00:40:08,161 --> 00:40:09,621
-Sit down.
-[Dowan] I told you to shut up.

595
00:40:09,704 --> 00:40:10,705
Shut up.

596
00:40:12,874 --> 00:40:13,875
Dowan.

597
00:40:13,959 --> 00:40:15,961
-Koo Dowan, stop.
-You asshole...

598
00:40:16,586 --> 00:40:19,464
Shut the hell up!

599
00:40:19,548 --> 00:40:20,590
You asshole.

600
00:40:20,674 --> 00:40:22,384
Koo Dowan.

601
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:25,428
I said shut up!

602
00:40:25,512 --> 00:40:27,138
<i>Asshole!</i>

603
00:40:27,848 --> 00:40:28,932
<i>Koo Dowan!</i>

604
00:40:34,688 --> 00:40:35,689
Yang Seungbin.

605
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:40,694
[groans]

606
00:40:42,988 --> 00:40:43,989
Why...

607
00:40:45,198 --> 00:40:47,158
Why am I lying here?

608
00:40:55,709 --> 00:40:59,337
[Donghun sighs] If he's acting,
that's terrifying.

609
00:40:59,421 --> 00:41:02,257
But it's also hard to believe he's not.

610
00:41:03,008 --> 00:41:04,009
[Eunseop] Ma'am.

611
00:41:04,092 --> 00:41:06,887
I got the results
of Yang Seungbin's psych evaluation.

612
00:41:10,098 --> 00:41:12,934
{\an8}[Soyeong] "The possibility of amnesia
and multiple personality disorder

613
00:41:13,018 --> 00:41:15,645
cannot be completely ruled out
requiring a full examination."

614
00:41:15,729 --> 00:41:16,771
What does that mean?

615
00:41:18,565 --> 00:41:20,692
[Eunseop] If that's acting,

616
00:41:20,775 --> 00:41:22,944
he should head straight to Hollywood.

617
00:41:23,028 --> 00:41:26,239
[gasps] He'll win an Oscar in no time.

618
00:41:26,823 --> 00:41:28,116
Let's go.

619
00:41:44,758 --> 00:41:47,177
You don't remember at all
what just happened?

620
00:41:47,844 --> 00:41:48,845
I...

621
00:41:49,346 --> 00:41:51,306
I don't remember anything.

622
00:41:51,389 --> 00:41:55,435
Why was I lying down
in the middle of the investigation?

623
00:41:59,314 --> 00:42:00,315
You don't remember?

624
00:42:00,941 --> 00:42:05,237
I do remember telling you I didn't do it.

625
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,446
Then...

626
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,949
All right. You might not know this,

627
00:42:09,032 --> 00:42:11,201
but there are other personalities in you.

628
00:42:11,284 --> 00:42:14,371
-What?
-Kim Dowan, Koo Seoyul.

629
00:42:15,288 --> 00:42:17,791
Kim Dowan, Koo Seoyul?

630
00:42:17,874 --> 00:42:18,917
Yes.

631
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,335
But it's strange.

632
00:42:21,211 --> 00:42:23,839
I never told Koo Seoyul I was an officer.

633
00:42:23,922 --> 00:42:26,049
Or that this is a police station.

634
00:42:26,633 --> 00:42:29,052
But Koo Seoyul called me "officer."

635
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,888
Oh...

636
00:42:32,889 --> 00:42:33,890
That's...

637
00:42:34,683 --> 00:42:39,312
I don't know who Kim Seoyul is.

638
00:42:40,355 --> 00:42:42,357
But we see rooms like this a lot on TV.

639
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:45,277
So he must have assumed
this was a police station.

640
00:42:45,944 --> 00:42:49,573
And because this is a police station,
you must be an officer.

641
00:42:51,032 --> 00:42:53,869
Right, I guess so.

642
00:43:08,091 --> 00:43:10,802
[Daeyong] I wonder what they're serving
for lunch.

643
00:43:10,886 --> 00:43:11,887
-[Hwaseon laughing]
-[Daeyong] Hey.

644
00:43:12,971 --> 00:43:14,181
Judge Kang.

645
00:43:14,264 --> 00:43:16,141
We saw you. You can't ignore us.

646
00:43:19,144 --> 00:43:21,271
[Daeyong] I heard you fainted
and went to the ER.

647
00:43:21,354 --> 00:43:23,773
You should quit given your health and all.

648
00:43:23,857 --> 00:43:26,443
Thank you for your well-wishes
early in the morning.

649
00:43:27,068 --> 00:43:29,279
Right. Did you meet with that man?

650
00:43:29,905 --> 00:43:32,199
The man you were waiting to hear from.

651
00:43:34,034 --> 00:43:36,077
I did and we met.

652
00:43:37,913 --> 00:43:39,831
You confessed, but he said no.

653
00:43:39,915 --> 00:43:43,126
So you were embarrassed
and pretended to faint?

654
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:44,461
[scoffs]

655
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:46,671
Goodness, sorry.

656
00:43:46,755 --> 00:43:48,632
My voice just projects so well.

657
00:43:48,715 --> 00:43:51,301
"The defendant, in this trial..."
[chuckles]

658
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:54,721
-I'm not surprised.
-[Daeyong chuckles]

659
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:56,640
Oh, right.

660
00:43:57,641 --> 00:44:01,686
When I'm with a certain someone,
my heart races. Why do you think that is?

661
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:03,021
Heart arrhythmia.

662
00:44:03,688 --> 00:44:06,691
Quit now and get some rest, Judge Kang.

663
00:44:08,652 --> 00:44:09,653
Goodbye.

664
00:44:13,198 --> 00:44:14,658
It's one-sided love for sure.

665
00:44:22,374 --> 00:44:26,920
Let me brief you on recent incidents
where the perpetrator is still at large.

666
00:44:28,713 --> 00:44:31,007
{\an8}First is the motiveless assault
at Daeyoung Station.

667
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:33,677
{\an8}And the victim? Are they dead?

668
00:44:35,262 --> 00:44:37,514
{\an8}Luckily, it was just a small scratch...

669
00:44:39,057 --> 00:44:40,725
-Next.
-Right, next.

670
00:44:40,809 --> 00:44:41,893
JUDGE KANG BITNA

671
00:44:41,977 --> 00:44:44,729
The king crab theft
at Noryangjin Fish Market.

672
00:44:45,313 --> 00:44:46,523
Who died there?

673
00:44:46,606 --> 00:44:49,317
Three of the ten king crabs
were found dead...

674
00:44:50,902 --> 00:44:53,071
Hey. Are you kidding me?

675
00:44:53,154 --> 00:44:55,532
But you asked for unsolved cases.

676
00:44:56,116 --> 00:44:57,659
Are you doing this on purpose?

677
00:44:58,451 --> 00:45:00,078
Wongyeong might hear you.

678
00:45:02,622 --> 00:45:03,623
Next.

679
00:45:05,458 --> 00:45:07,377
A family murder case in Changeun-dong.

680
00:45:08,420 --> 00:45:10,046
Why didn't you start with that?

681
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:11,464
Get into the details.

682
00:45:11,548 --> 00:45:14,509
"A woman in her 40s, middle school son
and elementary school daughter

683
00:45:14,593 --> 00:45:15,635
were found dead."

684
00:45:15,719 --> 00:45:18,054
And the father is the likely suspect.

685
00:45:18,138 --> 00:45:20,515
He's being interrogated
at the station now.

686
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:24,603
[chuckles] Get his personal information.

687
00:45:25,478 --> 00:45:27,147
Can't you just search for it?

688
00:45:28,815 --> 00:45:32,402
The precious human rights
of the perpetrator must be protected,

689
00:45:33,195 --> 00:45:35,405
so they're not revealing his identity.

690
00:45:36,156 --> 00:45:37,532
That's inconvenient.

691
00:45:38,158 --> 00:45:40,076
Find out who it is as fast as you can.

692
00:45:40,577 --> 00:45:43,872
Han Daon might be following you,
so be careful.

693
00:45:44,915 --> 00:45:47,375
Don't worry. I will be discreet.

694
00:45:51,922 --> 00:45:53,757
All three dead.

695
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:02,140
PRESS ROOM

696
00:46:11,316 --> 00:46:13,401
Goodness! Who are you?

697
00:46:14,694 --> 00:46:15,946
Who am I?

698
00:46:17,155 --> 00:46:18,698
This is me.

699
00:46:21,076 --> 00:46:24,204
-Lee Okgyu from SBC...
-[shushes]

700
00:46:26,206 --> 00:46:27,374
How is everyone?

701
00:46:28,041 --> 00:46:29,876
Are you here for that case, too?

702
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,628
The family murder case in Changeun?

703
00:46:31,711 --> 00:46:34,297
Changeun? Yes.

704
00:46:34,381 --> 00:46:37,634
The suspect's name...

705
00:46:37,717 --> 00:46:39,553
What was it?

706
00:46:41,263 --> 00:46:42,347
It's Yang Seungbin.

707
00:46:42,973 --> 00:46:44,558
Yang Seungbin.

708
00:46:44,641 --> 00:46:46,184
[Judge Kang] My goodness.

709
00:46:46,852 --> 00:46:47,978
Kids these days.

710
00:46:49,145 --> 00:46:51,648
I can't watch that filth.

711
00:46:52,566 --> 00:46:54,776
But what's taking him so long?

712
00:47:01,741 --> 00:47:04,828
HAN DA...

713
00:47:05,036 --> 00:47:06,872
[keypad beeping]

714
00:47:13,587 --> 00:47:15,130
Is that how you went?

715
00:47:15,755 --> 00:47:17,174
Aren't I completely disguised?

716
00:47:17,257 --> 00:47:19,718
You look desperate for attention.

717
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:23,972
Darn it.

718
00:47:24,055 --> 00:47:26,391
-Did you get his name?
-Yes.

719
00:47:28,059 --> 00:47:29,603
Yang Seungbin.

720
00:47:39,571 --> 00:47:43,408
{\an8}YANG SEUNGBIN

721
00:47:52,042 --> 00:47:54,336
[breathing shakily and crying]

722
00:47:58,006 --> 00:47:59,007
[Judge Kang] What's up with this guy?

723
00:48:02,302 --> 00:48:04,679
I heard from a reporter at the station

724
00:48:05,222 --> 00:48:07,057
that he has multiple personality disorder,

725
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:09,476
so he can't even remember
what he just said.

726
00:48:09,559 --> 00:48:12,938
One moment he says he didn't do it,
and the next, he confesses he did.

727
00:48:13,021 --> 00:48:14,022
In other words,

728
00:48:14,105 --> 00:48:17,567
it might have happened
when he was in a state of insanity.

729
00:48:18,235 --> 00:48:19,402
Can we kill him?

730
00:48:20,445 --> 00:48:24,282
Insanity or idiocy, he's still a killer.

731
00:48:30,914 --> 00:48:31,998
Seungbin.

732
00:48:32,707 --> 00:48:36,795
You didn't do that to the children, right?

733
00:48:38,171 --> 00:48:39,923
Something's gone wrong, right?

734
00:48:41,007 --> 00:48:43,552
There's no way you could do that, right?

735
00:48:43,635 --> 00:48:45,720
This is so unfair.

736
00:48:45,804 --> 00:48:48,139
I really didn't do it.

737
00:48:51,768 --> 00:48:53,854
Bunch of wusses.

738
00:48:55,564 --> 00:48:58,900
It's because you raised
your daughter terribly

739
00:48:58,984 --> 00:49:00,527
that they grew up like that.

740
00:49:02,362 --> 00:49:05,824
They died probably because
they deserved it, you old hag.

741
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:07,742
Seungbin.

742
00:49:08,577 --> 00:49:10,579
What are you saying right now?

743
00:49:10,662 --> 00:49:12,330
[Dowan] That bitch.

744
00:49:13,373 --> 00:49:16,376
She kept nagging him
about not making enough money.

745
00:49:16,459 --> 00:49:19,045
So I took the matter
into my own hands. Why?

746
00:49:20,589 --> 00:49:23,300
Seungbin couldn't do it, so I did.

747
00:49:23,925 --> 00:49:25,677
What?

748
00:49:26,261 --> 00:49:29,139
What on earth are you talking about?

749
00:49:30,891 --> 00:49:33,935
[Dowan] This is all because
you were a terrible mother!

750
00:49:34,019 --> 00:49:36,730
Hey, how could you call yourself a mother?

751
00:49:36,813 --> 00:49:38,398
All those hospital visits.

752
00:49:38,481 --> 00:49:40,400
You bled us dry.

753
00:49:41,234 --> 00:49:43,236
I should've killed you first!

754
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,363
As soon as I get out of here,

755
00:49:45,447 --> 00:49:48,283
I'm killing you first, you old hag!

756
00:49:49,159 --> 00:49:50,243
Let go!

757
00:49:50,327 --> 00:49:52,454
Let go, you motherfucker!

758
00:49:55,624 --> 00:49:57,792
How could...

759
00:49:59,085 --> 00:50:00,587
Seungbin...

760
00:50:01,963 --> 00:50:03,924
How could he do this?

761
00:50:04,508 --> 00:50:06,426
Stop saying that.

762
00:50:07,052 --> 00:50:09,429
I told you
it was a bad idea to go see him.

763
00:50:09,513 --> 00:50:13,558
That crazy bastard fooled us all!

764
00:50:13,642 --> 00:50:15,227
Didn't you hear the police?

765
00:50:17,646 --> 00:50:20,857
He habitually hit Eunjoo!

766
00:50:22,651 --> 00:50:25,237
-[both crying]
-I had no idea.

767
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:31,743
"Just hold on," I said.

768
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:34,955
I...

769
00:50:37,165 --> 00:50:39,876
I killed my daughter.

770
00:50:41,294 --> 00:50:42,337
I...

771
00:50:43,922 --> 00:50:45,382
I...

772
00:50:46,174 --> 00:50:48,802
killed my daughter. [sobbing]

773
00:50:53,265 --> 00:50:54,432
Goodness.

774
00:50:56,184 --> 00:51:00,272
I should be the one to die. Me.

775
00:51:00,355 --> 00:51:02,023
Me.

776
00:51:03,316 --> 00:51:06,695
Me...

777
00:51:12,284 --> 00:51:13,952
Mom.

778
00:51:14,035 --> 00:51:15,161
Mom!

779
00:51:15,745 --> 00:51:18,206
Mom! [sobbing]

780
00:51:18,874 --> 00:51:21,418
Please, help!

781
00:51:22,294 --> 00:51:24,588
Help!

782
00:51:25,297 --> 00:51:28,633
The victims were hit
in the back of the head with a hammer.

783
00:51:28,717 --> 00:51:32,679
The cause of death was severe bleeding
from a severed neck vein in all three.

784
00:51:32,762 --> 00:51:34,347
But autopsy results show

785
00:51:34,431 --> 00:51:37,851
Yang Seungbin continued to stab them
even after they died.

786
00:51:37,934 --> 00:51:39,644
On the wife and daughter's body,

787
00:51:39,728 --> 00:51:42,314
five and three stab wounds
were found, respectively.

788
00:51:42,397 --> 00:51:44,191
[breathing shakily]

789
00:51:52,282 --> 00:51:53,491
Mom.

790
00:52:16,515 --> 00:52:19,017
[Daon's mother] Daon, run away!

791
00:52:20,101 --> 00:52:23,522
[Eunseop] The damage to the son's body
was particularly severe.

792
00:52:23,605 --> 00:52:25,857
There were 13 stab wounds in total.

793
00:52:25,941 --> 00:52:28,235
I wouldn't even kill
my worst enemy that way.

794
00:52:30,654 --> 00:52:32,697
And one thing stood out.

795
00:52:33,657 --> 00:52:35,492
His son's phone found on the scene

796
00:52:35,575 --> 00:52:37,118
was severely damaged.

797
00:52:37,827 --> 00:52:39,246
And only his son's phone.

798
00:52:39,329 --> 00:52:40,622
Yes, it's here.

799
00:52:42,707 --> 00:52:45,460
That may be the key to this case.

800
00:52:46,044 --> 00:52:49,506
Maybe Yang Seungbin knew it
and broke his son's phone with a hammer.

801
00:52:49,589 --> 00:52:50,841
Yang Seungbin is

802
00:52:50,924 --> 00:52:53,134
pretending to have multiple personalities.

803
00:52:53,218 --> 00:52:57,180
During the investigation, I mixed up
the last names of his personalities.

804
00:52:57,264 --> 00:52:58,473
<i>You might not know this,</i>

805
00:52:59,015 --> 00:53:00,809
but there are other personalities in you.

806
00:53:00,892 --> 00:53:03,270
Kim Dowan, Koo Seoyul.

807
00:53:03,353 --> 00:53:06,356
I don't know who Kim Seoyul is. But...

808
00:53:06,439 --> 00:53:10,110
He claimed he had no idea,
but he corrected me and said "Kim Seoyul."

809
00:53:11,111 --> 00:53:12,362
He made a mistake.

810
00:53:12,445 --> 00:53:14,114
[sighs] Jeez.

811
00:53:16,074 --> 00:53:18,368
COURT

812
00:53:18,451 --> 00:53:19,536
[Yeongjin] What?

813
00:53:19,619 --> 00:53:20,871
Should I repeat myself?

814
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:23,832
Send me to collegiate court.

815
00:53:23,915 --> 00:53:28,670
It's not even the transfer season,
but you barge in here and say what?

816
00:53:29,254 --> 00:53:30,964
"Send me to collegiate court"?

817
00:53:31,798 --> 00:53:33,842
You arrogant little...

818
00:53:33,925 --> 00:53:35,218
Do you know where you are?

819
00:53:35,302 --> 00:53:36,678
In your office.

820
00:53:36,761 --> 00:53:39,097
{\an8}CHIEF JUDGE NA YEONGJIN

821
00:53:39,181 --> 00:53:40,307
{\an8}No, get out.

822
00:53:41,766 --> 00:53:43,101
That's too bad, then.

823
00:53:45,854 --> 00:53:47,147
[dial tone ringing]

824
00:53:47,898 --> 00:53:49,399
Why, hello.

825
00:53:49,482 --> 00:53:52,068
Assemblyman Jeong Jaegeol.

826
00:53:53,278 --> 00:53:54,654
It's Kang Bitna.

827
00:53:59,910 --> 00:54:02,704
She wants to be transferred
to collegiate court,

828
00:54:02,787 --> 00:54:04,372
and on top of that,

829
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:08,043
she's demanding
to be assigned to specific cases?

830
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:12,130
[scoffs] How can a judge behave this way?

831
00:54:12,214 --> 00:54:14,424
She can because she's a judge.

832
00:54:16,259 --> 00:54:19,012
Why did you grant
such a ridiculous request?

833
00:54:19,095 --> 00:54:22,766
Let's call it a solid investment
in an uncertain future.

834
00:54:23,683 --> 00:54:25,310
[chuckles]

835
00:54:26,603 --> 00:54:28,355
[Donghun] The prosecutor filed charges.

836
00:54:28,438 --> 00:54:30,232
And it's been assigned to court.

837
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:33,109
Then why look so upset?

838
00:54:33,193 --> 00:54:35,028
Kang Bitna is the judge.

839
00:54:35,111 --> 00:54:37,948
Doesn't she only preside
over single-judge courts?

840
00:54:38,031 --> 00:54:40,492
She's been transferred
to collegiate court.

841
00:54:40,575 --> 00:54:43,411
It's going to be another bullshit trial.

842
00:54:44,204 --> 00:54:46,998
Who knows?
She might have come to her senses.

843
00:54:48,291 --> 00:54:50,043
-When's the trial?
-[knock on door]

844
00:54:50,126 --> 00:54:52,629
Judge Kang, the other judges
are here to say hello.

845
00:54:52,712 --> 00:54:55,006
-Let them in...
-[Wongyeong] Come on.

846
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:56,925
She never listens to the end.

847
00:54:57,425 --> 00:55:00,428
JUDGE'S OFFICE

848
00:55:00,512 --> 00:55:01,638
-Hello.
-Hello.

849
00:55:01,721 --> 00:55:03,807
Hello. I'm glad you came.

850
00:55:03,890 --> 00:55:05,141
You know me, right?

851
00:55:05,225 --> 00:55:08,144
We've heard
so many great things about you.

852
00:55:08,770 --> 00:55:13,024
As my right and left-hand judges,
I need you to do something for me.

853
00:55:13,108 --> 00:55:14,317
-Anything.
-Sure.

854
00:55:15,277 --> 00:55:16,486
Don't do anything.

855
00:55:17,696 --> 00:55:18,780
Nothing.

856
00:55:19,573 --> 00:55:20,740
And don't say anything.

857
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:24,494
[chuckles]

858
00:55:30,792 --> 00:55:32,878
[Judge Kang] You seem busy.
I haven't seen you around.

859
00:55:35,964 --> 00:55:39,885
You were just following me around,
but I haven't heard from you lately.

860
00:55:40,468 --> 00:55:42,053
Why did you even move, then?

861
00:55:42,637 --> 00:55:43,722
Were you waiting for me?

862
00:55:44,556 --> 00:55:45,849
Of course not.

863
00:55:45,932 --> 00:55:47,475
I was taking out the trash.

864
00:55:48,685 --> 00:55:50,145
You're not holding anything.

865
00:55:50,228 --> 00:55:53,064
I was on my way back.

866
00:55:53,148 --> 00:55:54,649
Never mind if nothing's wrong.

867
00:55:57,652 --> 00:55:58,653
[Daon] The trial tomorrow...

868
00:55:59,988 --> 00:56:01,198
Good luck.

869
00:56:02,657 --> 00:56:04,367
I don't need luck.

870
00:56:22,427 --> 00:56:24,763
{\an8}COURT

871
00:56:24,846 --> 00:56:25,972
JUDGE KANG, LEAVE!

872
00:56:26,056 --> 00:56:27,432
STEP DOWN, JUDGE KANG!

873
00:56:27,516 --> 00:56:29,476
[bailiff] <i>Please take your seats.</i>

874
00:56:30,143 --> 00:56:31,978
The trial will commence.

875
00:56:32,062 --> 00:56:33,146
Prosecutor?

876
00:56:36,024 --> 00:56:38,944
"The defendant, Yang Seungbin,
mercilessly murdered

877
00:56:39,027 --> 00:56:40,654
his middle school son,

878
00:56:40,737 --> 00:56:42,614
wife, and 11-year-old daughter

879
00:56:42,697 --> 00:56:45,325
with a deadly weapon
in their own home in April 2024."

880
00:56:46,368 --> 00:56:50,664
"This is a heinous felony
that cannot be tolerated for any reason."

881
00:56:50,747 --> 00:56:53,375
{\an8}"Thus, the prosecution seeks
the death penalty,

882
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:56,586
the maximum sentence under the law,
for Defendant Yang Seungbin."

883
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:01,508
Defendant, do you admit the charges?

884
00:57:02,467 --> 00:57:04,469
Actually, I...

885
00:57:05,929 --> 00:57:07,514
We do not admit them.

886
00:57:07,597 --> 00:57:11,476
Your Honor, the defendant
recently experienced amnesia,

887
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,478
and is showing symptoms of

888
00:57:13,562 --> 00:57:16,815
dissociative identity disorder
or multiple personality disorder.

889
00:57:16,898 --> 00:57:19,192
Please take this into consideration.

890
00:57:21,194 --> 00:57:24,781
Your Honor, the defendant is only
pretending to have a mental disorder

891
00:57:24,865 --> 00:57:26,867
