THE JUDGE FROM HELL

00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,908
CHARACTERS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND EVENTS IN THIS DRAMA ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:33,992 --> 00:00:35,952
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
FILMED IN SAFE ENVIRONMENT

4
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:43,626
Please stop, Mr. Won!

5
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,546
It's dealing with the have-nots
that's most difficult.

6
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:47,922
The lowlifes.

7
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,801
Is this emergency services?
There's someone...

8
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,181
Stop right there, you bastard!

9
00:00:56,264 --> 00:00:57,474
It's you.

10
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:01,102
I've waited for 25 years.

11
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:07,859
EPISODE 8

12
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:51,319
THE JUDGE FROM HELL

13
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,372
{\an8}Did you change your shift?

14
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:06,042
{\an8}They'll give me the day shift
as soon as they find my replacement.

15
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:10,130
{\an8}Come home right after school
before it gets dark.

16
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,631
{\an8}Okay, I will.

17
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:14,634
{\an8}But he only attacked women.

18
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,095
{\an8}I worry more about Ms. Jang, Ms. Oh,

19
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,514
{\an8}Judge Kang and you than me.

20
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:22,058
{\an8}Especially Ms. Jang.
She goes to church every night.

21
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,145
{\an8}Thank you, Minjun.

22
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:30,150
{\an8}Ms. Oh, you should
collect the recycling during the day.

23
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,276
{\an8}It's dangerous at night.

24
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,986
Just take care of yourself.

25
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:34,946
You look even more dangerous.

26
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,741
You always work late.
I'm worried about you too.

27
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,451
Be careful.

28
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,455
Do you sleep with your eyes open?

29
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,499
What?

30
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,085
I said, you be careful too.
It's dangerous.

31
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,837
Right. I will.

32
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:57,010
Now, let us all pray
that the missing detective

33
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:58,511
returns home safely.

34
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:13,276
Dear Father, thank you for allowing
our Hwangcheon Villa family

35
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,111
to gather here today.

36
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:19,824
Please watch over sister Kim Soyeong
so that she can return home safely.

37
00:03:19,908 --> 00:03:20,909
Amen.

38
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,035
Amen.

39
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,580
{\an8}As an active officer
went missing during an investigation,

40
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,916
the chief gave instructions
to solve the case

41
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:30,793
as quickly as possible
by mobilizing all personnel.

42
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:34,464
The forensics team
is currently examining the scene.

43
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:37,133
We won't know until we get
the exact forensic results,

44
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,469
but the blood found on the scene

45
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,555
is presumed to be Detective Kim's.

46
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:44,515
One more thing.

47
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,851
Violent Crime Team 2
will sit this one out.

48
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:47,936
What?

49
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,188
Look. We're looking for our team leader.

50
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,107
- Why would we sit it out?
- Look at the state you're all in.

51
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,944
You won't be objective.

52
00:03:56,027 --> 00:03:57,654
- But...
- It's the chief's orders.

53
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,657
Violent Crime Team 2 will
focus on their case at hand.

54
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,499
Is it so terrible to miss one meal?

55
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:12,210
Why did you leave
Detective Kim alone there?

56
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,379
Stop it.

57
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:15,838
You know it's not his fault.

58
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,757
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,008
No.

60
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,011
Eunseop is right.

61
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:24,806
It's all my fault.

62
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,516
Because of me, Detective Kim...

63
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,185
We don't know what happened to her yet.

64
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,856
Don't you know what kind of person she is?

65
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,150
She will be back soon.

66
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:41,531
Where are you going?

67
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:44,325
To her home.

68
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,287
Take care of him.

69
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,337
It's okay, Dahui.

70
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,215
Mom will be back, don't worry.

71
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,345
It's all right.

72
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,351
Daon.

73
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,354
Mom's not picking up.

74
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,525
Can you hurry up and find her?

75
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:20,194
Find her now!

76
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,202
It's all right.

77
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,038
She'll be back soon.

78
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,377
When the statute expired
and records were discarded,

79
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:37,670
Soyeong made a copy.

80
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,755
J SERIAL KILLING CASE 5

81
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,302
Soyeong told me not long ago

82
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,095
that she thought he was back.

83
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,474
I'm showing you this for one reason.

84
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,854
As much as she tried to keep the promise
she made to you as an officer,

85
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,899
you should take responsibility

86
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,276
and do your job as an officer

87
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:02,779
without wavering.

88
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:08,034
Soyeong won't go down easily.

89
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,412
Let's trust that and wait.

90
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,000
Okay.

91
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,104
Are you back from work now?

92
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:38,106
Yes.

93
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,816
Did you find Detective Kim?

94
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:41,818
She'll be back.

95
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,736
Are you all right?

96
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:47,365
I'm fine. She'll be back soon.

97
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,049
JUDGE KANG BITNA

98
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:10,430
{\an8}KIM SOYEO

99
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,477
She'll come back.

100
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,439
Because Han Daon believes she will.

101
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,446
But has he been eating?

102
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,489
I don't think he's sleeping much.

103
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:36,372
DETECTIVE HAN

104
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,799
<i>Can you come with me
to meet someone?</i>

105
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,801
<i>Who?</i>

106
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,515
<i>Someone who will prove
the victim's innocence.</i>

107
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:58,561
<i>I don't care about
the victim's innocence...</i>

108
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:08,613
<i>When are you going?</i>

109
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,496
Choi Wonjoong is arguing
that Won Changseon used the strike

110
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:19,332
to extort money
because of his gambling debts.

111
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:22,126
His daughter has cancer
and needs chemotherapy.

112
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:25,087
Insurance didn't cover it,
so it's true he needed money.

113
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:26,881
But gambling?

114
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,843
That's a lie
maliciously made up by the CEO.

115
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:33,971
I know it's a lot to ask,
but could you say in court

116
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,890
what you just told me?

117
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:42,855
I was thinking to find another job anyway
because I can't stand this company.

118
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,359
If it's for his honor,

119
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,444
I will gladly testify.

120
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,531
Thank you so much.

121
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,167
{\an8}WITNESS STAND

122
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,669
Your Honor.

123
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,629
An hour has passed already.

124
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,923
At this point,

125
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:12,343
I think it's fair to say
that the witness is not coming.

126
00:09:15,763 --> 00:09:17,139
Let's wait five more minutes.

127
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,310
DEFENDANT

128
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:24,855
Excuse me.

129
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,315
I'm a witness.

130
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,907
You were close
with the victim, correct?

131
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,953
- Yes.
- The victim had a huge amount of debt.

132
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,329
Do you know why?

133
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,084
I heard it was from gambling.

134
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:49,005
Did the victim tell
you anything else in relation to the debt?

135
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:54,260
He said, "I'm going to threaten
the CEO with a strike

136
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,054
and use the extorted money
to pay off my debts."

137
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,474
No more questions.

138
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:05,146
The victim had a large debt
due to gambling.

139
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:08,107
He had no way to pay it back,
so he used the strike

140
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:10,610
to threaten the defendant.

141
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:11,986
And the defendant

142
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:15,031
gave the victim money to end the strike.

143
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:18,492
But he couldn't contain his anger,
so he kidnapped and assaulted the victim.

144
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,995
And the victim,
who disappeared after that,

145
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,164
ended up taking his own life.

146
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,585
Is this the defendant's argument?

147
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:29,879
That is precise, Your Honor.

148
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,049
Does the prosecution
have more to say

149
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,634
about the defendant's claims?

150
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,677
No, Your Honor.

151
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:38,971
I see.

152
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,058
I will see you on sentencing day.

153
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:13,839
Sir, wait.

154
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,716
We need to talk.

155
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,801
I'm sorry.

156
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,303
I'm so sorry.

157
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,430
I'm sorry...

158
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,350
I'm sorry...

159
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:26,185
I'm sorry...

160
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,687
KICK JUDGE KANG OUT OF COURT

161
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,857
Thank you, Lord, for your grace
and for blessing us with this food.

162
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:37,154
Thank you for blessing everyone
who is gathered here today.

163
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,532
In the name of Jesus we pray.

164
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,200
- Amen.
- Amen.

165
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,828
Please, let's eat.

166
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,997
Good work, Judge Kang.

167
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,582
You really earned this.

168
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,584
I didn't do much.

169
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:52,712
I'm actually honored

170
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:57,091
to be dining with such a stellar line-up.

171
00:11:57,174 --> 00:12:01,053
By the way, how did you fabricate
evidence related to gambling?

172
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,763
The documents were a work of art.

173
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,725
The lawyers did great work.

174
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,103
How did you get
the union's vice chairman on your side?

175
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:11,188
Throwing away all pride and conscience

176
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,441
when offered even a small sum

177
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:15,234
is what poor people do.

178
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,779
I'd rather die than live like that.

179
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,239
What a wretched life.

180
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,992
Pretending to know their life
without having been poor,

181
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,076
I don't care for that.

182
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,412
Everyone is vulnerable to money.

183
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,331
Judge Kang, my son is

184
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,960
praying hard in the lockup
and reflecting.

185
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,963
Is he asking
the deceased victim for forgiveness?

186
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,549
No, the Lord.

187
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:42,261
The Lord has already forgiven him.

188
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:46,098
It's now your turn
to forgive him, Judge Kang.

189
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,602
Shall we toast?

190
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,814
To a successful trial.

191
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,649
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

192
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,156
Here you go.

193
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:09,038
The only survivor of serial killer J,

194
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:10,998
- I found him.
- Really?

195
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,625
Who is it? Where is he now?

196
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:17,129
Actually, you know him quite well.

197
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,423
Here.

198
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:24,011
Who in my close-knit circle is it?

199
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,645
HAN DAON

200
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,980
The kid who lost his parents
and sibling

201
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,273
is Han Daon?

202
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,275
Yes.

203
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,322
Are you upset?

204
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,493
No, I'm really glad.

205
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,037
The thought of going back to Hell
makes me happy.

206
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,873
I feel like flying.

207
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,252
Welcome.

208
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,419
Excuse me.

209
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:17,481
Daon. What do you mean we
should protect Choi Wonjoong?

210
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:21,694
Moon Jeongjun, Bae Jayeong,
and Yang Seungbin who were murdered,

211
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:25,364
were all released after receiving
light sentences from Judge Kang.

212
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,826
If Choi Wonjoong is released
after this trial,

213
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:31,120
he would be the next target.

214
00:14:31,203 --> 00:14:33,163
So you want us to protect that bastard?

215
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:36,041
When we haven't even found
Detective Kim yet?

216
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,586
- Who cares if that bastard dies?
- Hey.

217
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,045
You're an officer.

218
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:42,756
I know how you feel.

219
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:47,094
But before any more victims turn up,
we have to catch them.

220
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,847
Detective Kim would want that.

221
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:53,767
So what should we do?

222
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,615
You can't just let her go.
This woman stabbed me.

223
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,950
And thank you for acquitting Daon

224
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:11,619
for the direct assault.

225
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,044
What are you doing there?

226
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,889
You said you wanted to ask me something.

227
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,059
I had to hear it from you.

228
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,979
Only then can I believe it.

229
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,067
What is it?

230
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,699
What time is it now?

231
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,079
It's 10 p.m.

232
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,664
That wasn't the question, right?

233
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,499
Why not?

234
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:03,212
Officers know the exact time,
that's why I came.

235
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,840
And now that I know, I should go.

236
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,512
The sentencing hearing...

237
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:16,308
Whatever ruling you give,

238
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,643
do your best.

239
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,938
I will, too.

240
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,442
Okay, whatever.

241
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,076
COURT

242
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,620
Case number 2024GoDan235.

243
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,707
I'll pronounce the verdict
on the defendant Choi Wonjoong.

244
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,209
The defendant, CEO of KO Food,

245
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,752
was unhappy with the activities

246
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:46,547
of Won Changseon,
the chairman of his company's union.

247
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,217
Thus, he kidnapped, brutally assaulted,
and seriously injured the victim.

248
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,803
Eventually, the victim took his own life.

249
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:54,972
The shame and humiliation that the victim,

250
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:58,684
an ordinary family man,
felt during the assault by the defendant,

251
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:03,063
may have been more severe
than the physical pain he experienced.

252
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:06,775
Therefore, a heavy sentence
for the defendant is inevitable.

253
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,947
However, the defendant
paid a deposit to the court,

254
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:15,200
has actively promoted
the national economy as a businessman,

255
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:18,495
contributed to job creation,
and deeply regrets his actions.

256
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,372
Taking this into consideration,

257
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:23,959
it is questionable whether
giving the defendant a heavy sentence

258
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,003
is really in the public interest.

259
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,713
Also, though we can infer

260
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:31,467
that the defendant's assault
contributed to the victim's death,

261
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,762
there is no decisive evidence
confirming it was the cause.

262
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:37,389
And these are mitigating circumstances.

263
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:42,895
Criminal Act Article 281-1, Arrest,
Confinement Causing Bodily Harm applies.

264
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,439
Having considered all this, the court

265
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,566
shall rule as follows.

266
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:50,110
The defendant, Choi Wonjoong, is sentenced

267
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:53,697
to one year in prison,
two years of probation,

268
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,366
and 40 hours of community service.

269
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,217
All rise.

270
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,431
Your Honor!

271
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,267
Your Honor!

272
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:23,977
You can't do this.

273
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,312
Your Honor!

274
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,650
This isn't right.

275
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,737
He's never even apologized to us.

276
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,323
Why are you forgiving him as you please?

277
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,117
You have no right to!

278
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,202
What were you hoping for?

279
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,913
That he gets what he deserves.

280
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:46,542
I've always made my judgements that way.

281
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,170
This is ridiculous.

282
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:51,338
Hey.

283
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,340
- Are you okay?
- Yugyeong!

284
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,051
Hurry, call an ambulance!

285
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,012
- Yugyeong, wake up!
- Hurry, take her.

286
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,852
Yugyeong!
Oh, no, Yugyeong...

287
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,191
Yugyeong.

288
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,005
RUDE JUDGE'S ABSURD RULING

289
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:36,967
How dare a mere reporter
write about a judge like this?

290
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,594
They're not wrong.

291
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,179
How can you joke right now?

292
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:43,682
You're all over the Internet right now!

293
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,021
Those idiots don't even know the law.

294
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:52,774
Because they don't know the law,
you and I can make a living.

295
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,193
You should be grateful.

296
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,071
Anyway, congratulations.

297
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:00,240
Assemblyman Jeong will be happy with you.

298
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,713
Don't nag me.
I'm going to quit when I'm ready.

299
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,840
You can like
the malicious comments about me.

300
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,552
Wow, how did she know?

301
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,387
She might be a mind reader.

302
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,097
A mind reader?

303
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,809
Yes, but the ruling

304
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,437
- is at the judge's discretion...
- I understand you're upset,

305
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,649
but Judge Kang made the ruling
based on the law...

306
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,278
Yes, I understand, but...

307
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,572
Please stop yelling.

308
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:43,700
No need for you two to be yelled at
for my ruling.

309
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,410
JUDGE'S OFFICE

310
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,218
Why did he look at me like that?

311
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:04,263
Makes me feel bad.

312
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,144
Arong messaged me.
She's done checking the place out.

313
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:14,064
Tell her to stand by so she can come
as soon as I call her.

314
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,440
Okay.

315
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:20,404
They've been criticizing you harshly.
Are you upset?

316
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:24,032
- When was I not criticized?
- That's true.

317
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:26,159
Where are the thugs
who kidnapped the victim?

318
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:29,162
They're criminals, too.
I should kill and send them to Hell.

319
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,957
Yes, Jaehyeon and Dongju
are asking around for them.

320
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,417
They'll report back.

321
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:38,547
By the way, Justitia,
are you going to keep working with Arong?

322
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,382
Yeah, why?

323
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,759
Just, she doesn't seem like a good demon.

324
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,679
Demons are supposed to be bad.

325
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:47,222
But she's not just bad.

326
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,977
I really do think she's Satan.

327
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,437
What are you talking about?

328
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,231
There's no way she'd betray me.
You might though.

329
00:21:56,315 --> 00:22:00,569
Seriously, she might stab you
in the back, Justitia.

330
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,655
Gosh.

331
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,033
How is the victim's daughter?

332
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:10,245
She's in the hospice ward
because her condition is serious.

333
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,789
Are you... worried?

334
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,292
It's not my fault. Why would I worry?

335
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,252
Right?

336
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:22,674
By the way, is your terrible personality
innate?

337
00:22:22,758 --> 00:22:25,385
- Do I need to beat you to make you leave?
- No.

338
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,860
She stopped her chemotherapy
for too long.

339
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,446
You should prepare yourself.

340
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,326
No, Doctor.

341
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,828
Please save my Yugyeong.

342
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,628
Yugyeong.

343
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,422
Yugyeong...

344
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:22,901
Mom.

345
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,820
I'm thirsty.

346
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,241
I'm right here.

347
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,036
I'm here.

348
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,247
I'm here.

349
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,959
{\an8}<i>The identities of four men who died</i>

350
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,420
{\an8}<i>in a recent unexplained fire
have been revealed.</i>

351
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,507
{\an8}<i>They were all organized crime figures
wanted for kidnapping</i>

352
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,217
{\an8}<i>the head of the KO Food union.</i>

353
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,927
{\an8}<i>- Park Hyeonggon.</i>
- Why'd you do that?

354
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,720
Trash that cannot be recycled

355
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,722
has to be incinerated.

356
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:53,807
Are you nuts?

357
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:57,561
We only clean up dead humans.

358
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:59,479
We don't interfere in their lives.

359
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,566
If Justitia finds out
you kept them from her

360
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,484
and killed them yourself,

361
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,611
you're dead.

362
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:08,530
I'm not.

363
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,199
Because you'll keep it a secret.

364
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,909
Gosh.

365
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,871
It's become 1.5 cm smaller.

366
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,252
Is that possible, Doctor?

367
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:26,131
Sometimes, there are miracles
that cannot be explained by medicine.

368
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,967
You don't have to
worry about the cost now.

369
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,927
So don't miss your appointments.

370
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:34,598
I'd like to thank the person
who sponsored my treatment.

371
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,809
They don't want to reveal who they are.

372
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,769
Don't forget their kindness,

373
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,688
and continue with the treatment

374
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,566
so you can live long, for your father.

375
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,651
Yes, Doctor.

376
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,821
Why did you donate
200 million to the hospital?

377
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,282
Don't you know
demons are prohibited from donating?

378
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,617
You knew about that?

379
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,579
Goodness. If you don't like it,
report me to Hell.

380
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,873
I can't be bothered.

381
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,753
Isn't it amazing that Yugyeong woke up?

382
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:08,298
This must be one of those miracles
people talk about.

383
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:11,259
- Miracles?
- Yeah.

384
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:20,727
Who knows?

385
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,940
Maybe an angel visited her.

386
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,339
Let's go, run!

387
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,883
Good dog!

388
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,559
Why did you refuse protection?

389
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:08,775
The trial's over.

390
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:10,860
And I'm out.

391
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,113
Nothing's happened so far.

392
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,365
No one knows what might happen.

393
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,369
It sounds like
you want something to happen.

394
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,704
I'm an officer.

395
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,666
It's my duty to protect you
in case something happens.

396
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,501
There's no need. You can go.

397
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,086
Nothing's going to happen.

398
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,630
But if anyone does attack me,

399
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,882
I'll win.

400
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,060
- Donghun.
- Yeah?

401
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,979
He's refusing protection.

402
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,482
He has no idea
he should be afraid right now.

403
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,484
How can he be so cocky?

404
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,236
I think he's in danger.

405
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:57,282
Then let's move on to the next plan.

406
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,242
Okay. Let's get on it.

407
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,535
- All right.
- Okay.

408
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:24,601
{\an8}CHOI WONJOONG

409
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:27,437
<i>Heavenly Father,
who has forgiven me all my sins,</i>

410
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:29,522
<i>thank you.</i>

411
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,107
Thank you for being on my side

412
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,486
and with me always so I can enjoy

413
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,363
greater wealth,

414
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:40,659
health, and blessings compared to others.

415
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,535
I truly thank you.

416
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:55,131
ARONG

417
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:00,762
Start it.

418
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:06,768
RESTRICTED CALLER ID

419
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,728
Yes, this is Choi Wonjoong.

420
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,523
<i>Mister, do you think
praying at church</i>

421
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:14,776
<i>means you can get away with murder?</i>

422
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,946
Hey, kid.
You shouldn't prank call people like this.

423
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,074
<i>You hired thugs</i>

424
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:25,078
<i>and hung a poor man on a tree to die.</i>

425
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:28,081
<i>I have proof that you ordered them</i>

426
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,916
<i>to kill him.</i>

427
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:32,127
<i>Can I post it online?</i>

428
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:34,337
Who are you?

429
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,257
Who told you to do this?

430
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,466
<i>If you're curious,</i>

431
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,846
come to the theme park
near your golfing range now.

432
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,764
Oh, right. Mister!

433
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,767
If you tell anyone or don't come alone,

434
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:51,146
I'm going to post everything online.

435
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,190
Hello!

436
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,868
Weren't they killed in the fire?
The guys we hired?

437
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,537
- That's what we heard.
- "That's what we heard"?

438
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,707
Are the officers still outside?

439
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:12,375
Yes, sir.

440
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,544
But do the police

441
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:17,756
really need to protect a scumbag like him?

442
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,049
Do you think I became an officer for this?

443
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,179
If Detective Kim were here,

444
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,391
she would have said we definitely need to.

445
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:30,894
Hey!

446
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:38,860
What's the license plate number?

447
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,445
- Three, five, two, nine.
- Three, five...

448
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:41,654
- Okay, let's go.
- Okay.

449
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:29,702
Let's talk.

450
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:33,957
- Tell me the truth.
- About what?

451
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,543
You know what I mean.

452
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,920
I know you're going to kill Choi Wonjoong.

453
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,172
Stop now.

454
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:44,592
I don't want to arrest you myself.

455
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,595
This is the last chance I can give you.

456
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,181
Why don't you be honest
with me first?

457
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,226
What you think about the serial killer J

458
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,187
who brutally murdered your family?

459
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:59,232
Don't you want to find him
and kill him now?

460
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:05,446
I do want to find him,

461
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,448
but I want him to be tried by the law.

462
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,493
I've never wanted to kill him.

463
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:15,832
The statute's expired.
How will you put him on trial?

464
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,461
Detective Han Daon.

465
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,506
Don't chase me. Help me.

466
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,884
Then I will find him

467
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,261
and make him pay in your place

468
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,430
because the law can't.

469
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:36,269
Compared to what your family experienced,
it will be more horrible

470
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,104
and violent.

471
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:42,358
I'm an officer.

472
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,110
I can't do that.

473
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,619
I gave you a chance, too.

474
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,662
You're the one who refused.

475
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,135
Let me just say this one last thing.

476
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,512
For believing in me

477
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:14,515
and telling me it wasn't my fault,

478
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,101
thank you.

479
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,319
Be grateful I didn't slap you.

480
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,448
It's my goodbye present.

481
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,261
Bang!

482
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,763
You scared me, damn it!

483
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,645
Who are you, asshole?

484
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:01,813
Damn it!

485
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,484
You really came.

486
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,309
It was so close.

487
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:41,477
- So close.
- Nice shot.

488
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:42,770
Not now.

489
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,909
Nice shot, Justitia!

490
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,703
- Say it.
- Nice shot.

491
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:03,583
Where should I hit next?

492
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,229
You must be curious
why I'm doing this to you.

493
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,444
But don't ask. I'm too tired to answer.

494
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,157
If you move, you'll get hurt.

495
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,913
Well, you'll still get hurt if you don't.

496
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:47,418
- You guys can go home.
- Oh, okay.

497
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:48,920
Go take it off.

498
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,970
You damn judge!

499
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,431
Why are you doing this to me?

500
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,933
Why?

501
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,643
I told you...

502
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:08,189
don't ask.

503
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:11,275
I won't ask, I won't...

504
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,237
Wow.

505
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:18,407
He fainted. He shouldn't faint already.

506
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:21,369
I should hit him to wake him up.

507
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,546
Good shot.

508
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,174
God damn it.

509
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,220
Stop!

510
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:41,055
Stop!

511
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,181
Thank you!

512
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,724
What happened, sir?

513
00:35:43,808 --> 00:35:44,934
Thank you!

514
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,352
For what?

515
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,104
Go, go!

516
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,607
SERGEANT CLEANING

517
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,734
- Go!
- Okay!

518
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,949
Please forgive me! I was wrong.

519
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,879
What the...

520
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,245
Let me out!

521
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,080
Please, let me out!

522
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,990
What have you done to me?

523
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,451
I'm just getting started.

524
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:09,328
Your real trial begins now.

525
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:14,750
Do you admit that you, sinner
Choi Wonjoong, murdered Won Changseon

526
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,712
and yet are unrepentant and unforgiven?

527
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:23,634
What kind of bullshit is that?

528
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,845
You bitch!

529
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:32,393
Fine. It's not fun
if you repent right away anyways.

530
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,982
What kind of bullshit
are you trying to pull?

531
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,047
What's that? What the...

532
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:34,413
TICKET BOX

533
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,407
Why are you doing this to me?

534
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,887
Did you have fun?

535
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,515
What do you think?

536
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,204
Help!

537
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:43,769
Help...

538
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:50,067
Yes, I was wrong. Let me go.

539
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:53,821
- What did you do wrong?
- I killed him. I killed Won Changseon.

540
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,907
I hired people to kidnap him

541
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,618
and beat him.

542
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,745
I made it look like a suicide
and killed him.

543
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,455
I'm sorry.

544
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,499
I'm sorry. Please, stop.

545
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,252
- I'm sorry.
- Right? You killed him, right?

546
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,629
Yes.

547
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,881
Then do you regret killing him?

548
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,133
Have you been forgiven?

549
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:16,885
I repented at church.

550
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:19,346
I said "I'm sorry" at church.

551
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:23,892
And God forgave me.

552
00:43:24,893 --> 00:43:26,103
Not that.

553
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:29,023
Did you apologize to the victim?
Were you forgiven?

554
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:33,110
What?

555
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:37,156
I've already been saved by the Lord.

556
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:48,500
Wrong.

557
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,253
"Execute killers
unforgiven by their victims

558
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:53,005
and unrepentant of their sins

559
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:55,382
and send them to Hell."

560
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:57,176
That's what God wants.

561
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:01,513
It's the only power God gave demons.

562
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,601
Demons?

563
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:09,313
Go to Hell.

564
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:30,209
Geenna

565
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,808
geenna

566
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,105
Court is adjourned.

567
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,394
So you did kill them all.

568
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:15,564
Moon Jeongjun, Bae Jayeong, Yang Seungbin
and now Choi Wonjoong.

569
00:46:15,647 --> 00:46:16,732
How are you here?

570
00:46:24,406 --> 00:46:25,657
For believing in me

571
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:27,451
and telling me it wasn't my fault,

572
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:28,535
thank you.

573
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:45,469
No.

574
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:02,986
But what I said then was all true...

575
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,071
Shut up!

576
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:11,203
Give me your phone.

577
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,468
How...

578
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:27,970
How did you?

579
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:30,430
<i>Amen.</i>

580
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,725
What did you pray for?

581
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,272
Someone's been picking on me.

582
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:40,566
I prayed they'd go back to Hell soon.

583
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:44,403
I mean, I even bought sulfur powder.
For revenge.

584
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,906
How can you get revenge with that?

585
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,744
It's a secret,

586
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,498
but if you throw sulfur powder at a demon,

587
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:58,750
their powers are frozen
for an hour or two.

588
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,752
Koo Mando, that idiot.

589
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:12,347
Let go!

590
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:14,349
Kang Bitna,
you're under arrest for murder.

591
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:16,560
- You have the right to remain silent...
- Shut up.

592
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,729
I won't complain if you don't read me it.

593
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:21,982
I'm not petty or cheap like you.

594
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:27,195
EUNSEOP

595
00:48:28,947 --> 00:48:29,948
Go ahead.

596
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,035
You found Detective Kim?

597
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:34,995
Where?

598
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:36,705
I'm on my way.

599
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,133
Soyeong.

600
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:34,716
{\an8}YEAR 1999, YEONJU-DONG

601
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:04,037
Wait! Don't step on it.
We have to preserve the scene.

602
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,915
Requesting backup.
There's a homicide in 312 Yeonju-dong!

603
00:52:06,998 --> 00:52:08,416
We need emergency backup!

604
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:12,462
Is someone in there?

605
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:24,891
- Mom!
- Wait!

606
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,061
You can't go out there now.

607
00:52:29,771 --> 00:52:31,648
- Mom.
- No.

608
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,036
Officer.

609
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:49,249
My dad, mom, and Jion.

610
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,751
When are they coming back
from the hospital?

611
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,254
They'll be back soon.

612
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,224
Why are you crying?

613
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,689
You're lying right now, aren't you?

614
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,323
I'm...

615
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:23,909
going to become a great detective

616
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,702
and catch whoever did this

617
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,497
to your mom and dad

618
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,417
and Jion.

619
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:34,294
I promise.

620
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,432
What happened to the boy?

621
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:49,517
There's no relative to take care of him.

622
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:50,810
From Yeonju-dong?

623
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,313
Was it White Tree Childcare Center?

624
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,232
I hear he's staying there.

625
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:58,860
But isn't the center too far

626
00:53:58,944 --> 00:54:01,404
from Manjae Elementary
for such a little boy?

627
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,867
Fight!

628
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,036
- Get off, you beggar!
- Fight!

629
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,120
Get off me!

630
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,539
Move!

631
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:14,751
Get off, you orphan!
Do you have a death wish?

632
00:54:14,834 --> 00:54:16,962
Stop it! Stop!

633
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:19,965
Han Daon lives in an orphanage.

634
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:21,466
Don't play with him.

635
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:22,592
Beggar!

636
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:24,010
He's an orphan.

637
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:25,220
It's because
he doesn't have parents.

638
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:26,346
Are you okay?

639
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:29,849
I bought you some sneakers.
Do you want to try them on?

640
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,060
Do you pity me because I'm an orphan, too?

641
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:35,480
I'm not a beggar! I don't need this!

642
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,817
- It's not that.
- You're a liar.

643
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:43,113
You said you'd catch the killer.
You didn't keep your promise.

644
00:54:43,655 --> 00:54:45,282
You suck, get lost!

645
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:50,829
Get lost now!

646
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,182
Kim Yeongsu's mother?

647
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:14,019
Yeongsu... Hello!

648
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:18,481
Next is Kim Chaeyeon's mother.

649
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,567
- Hello.
- Hello.

650
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:23,570
- He's alone.
- Daon!

651
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,241
I told you.

652
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:29,743
Stop coming.

653
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:32,162
I don't want to see you. I'm tired of you.

654
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:35,206
Are you mad because I'm late?

655
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,001
Give it. Come here.

656
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:40,670
Daon, let's do it together.

657
00:55:40,754 --> 00:55:43,423
I made this, it's really good.
We made this together.

658
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,633
Come on. Let's go.

659
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,928
There's one space left
for parents' kickball.

660
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,805
- Would anyone like to join?
- Me!

661
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:53,308
I'm Han Daon's mom. Class 3-1.

662
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:56,144
Yes, Daon's mother.

663
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:58,271
- Let's go, Daon. This way.
- Okay.

664
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,689
It's Daon's mother.

665
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,983
- You got this!
- We got this! Let's go, Daon.

666
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,904
MANJAE ELEMENTARY
CLASS KICKBALL MATCH

667
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:16,581
One more!

668
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:21,252
One more!

669
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:30,512
Hey, what are you doing?

670
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:38,561
Out!

671
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,571
Give me your hand.

672
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:54,577
This? I'm fine. It's not even bleeding.

673
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:55,870
Not that.

674
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,127
Okay.

675
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:07,382
Why won't it get better?

676
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,801
That's annoying.

677
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:16,224
Have you thought about
what Hyeongseok and I said last time?

678
00:57:16,975 --> 00:57:19,185
When we move into a new house next year,

679
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,729
we want to live with you.

680
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:25,567
We would like to live with you

681
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:28,069
and be your family.

682
00:57:28,153 --> 00:57:30,572
You can have your own room there.

683
00:57:30,655 --> 00:57:32,240
I don't need it.

684
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,830
I want to sleep in the same room

685
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,833
as you guys.

686
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:43,084
What?

687
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,430
Thank you, Daon.

688
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,684
On the count of three, okay?

689
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,646
Now, smile.

690
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:08,693
One, two, three!

691
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:37,764
Daon.

692
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,858
Can you kill someone for me?

693
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:13,776
Who?

694
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,111
Serial killer J.

695
01:00:16,946 --> 01:00:18,823
Find him and send him to Hell.

696
01:00:20,658 --> 01:00:22,660
You can do it because you're a demon.

697
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:26,080
No, let's do it together.

698
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:31,085
I'm going to rip him to shreds
when I see him!

699
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:33,546
- Han Daon.
- Didn't you hear me?

700
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:34,839
Should I say it again?

701
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:36,883
I'm going to kill that bastard!

702
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:40,428
No. Then you'll go to Hell, too.

703
01:00:45,683 --> 01:00:47,435
After I kill that bastard,

704
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,938
you can kill me and send me to Hell.

705
01:00:57,612 --> 01:00:59,864
I will gladly let you kill me then.

706
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:07,622
That promise,

707
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,708
make sure you keep it.

708
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:34,792

01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,800
{\an8}all we need to do is kill him.

723
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,635
{\an8}Whoever killed Kim Soyeong,
listen carefully.

724
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:28,387
{\an8}<i>I will chase you to the ends of Hell!</i>

725
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:30,807
{\an8}And catch you myself.

726
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:34,227
{\an8}<i>If you want to go to Hell,
you should see it first.</i>

727
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:37,522
{\an8}<i>The moment you join hands with a demon,</i>

728
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:39,524
{\an8}<i>you will have to give up many things.</i>

729
01:03:39,607 --> 01:03:42,652
{\an8}<i>Whether you use Daon and discard him
or protect him.</i>

730
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,071
{\an8}<i>She cried?</i>

731
01:03:45,988 --> 01:03:47,198
{\an8}<i>It's up to you.</i>
