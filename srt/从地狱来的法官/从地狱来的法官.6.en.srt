Are you here to measure my blood pressure?

[Judge Kang] No, I'm here to treat you.

[spectator 2] I feel so bad for them.

00:13:36,736 --> 00:13:39,239
Yang Seungbin clearly knew who he was

194
00:13:39,322 --> 00:13:40,907
when he murdered his family.

195

Please accept this recording,
which disproves his claim

196
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:47,706

committed the murders,

197
00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:49,875
as evidence, Your Honor.

How do you feel having heard
your own brutal acts?

Assaulting your wife in the elevator
and repeated child abuse. God...

208
00:14:52,646 --> 00:14:54,272
All this must have been true.

Yes.

216
00:15:35,438 --> 00:15:39,234
I don't remember killing my family...

217
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:41,361
I said, speak up.

Is that so hard?

219
00:15:44,322 --> 00:15:47,534

[Seoyul] Dowan, please don't do this.

225
00:16:08,346 --> 00:16:11,349
The judge might get mad.

226
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:14,227
[Dowan] Shut up! You think
I won't kill a judge?

227

Sit down!

230
00:16:31,661 --> 00:16:34,623
Case number 2024GoHap237.

231
00:16:34,706 --> 00:16:37,209
The verdict on defendant Yang Seungbin
is as follows.

232
00:16:37,834 --> 00:16:42,631
Defendant Yang Seungbin brutally murdered
his innocent wife and two young children.

233
00:16:42,714 --> 00:16:45,425
This is a serious crime.

234
00:16:45,509 --> 00:16:49,262
Thus, it is inevitable that the defendant
shall be given a heavy sentence.

235
00:16:50,514 --> 00:16:53,183
However,
before the defendant lost his job,

236
00:16:53,266 --> 00:16:56,186
he lived diligently
as the head of his family

237
00:16:56,269 --> 00:16:58,855
and is a first-time offender
with no prior convictions.

238
00:16:58,939 --> 00:17:01,775
These are mitigating circumstances
in the defendant's favor.

239
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:04,402
As for the evidence submitted
during the trial,

240
00:17:04,486 --> 00:17:06,613
since it hadn't been submitted in advance,

241
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:11,326
it is inadmissible as evidence
in this trial.

242
00:17:11,409 --> 00:17:13,328
Thus, the defendant

243
00:17:13,411 --> 00:17:17,123
is still considered
to have committed the offense

244
00:17:17,207 --> 00:17:21,169
in a state of insanity due to amnesia
and multiple personality disorder.

245
00:17:23,463 --> 00:17:24,631
Thus, the court,

246
00:17:24,714 --> 00:17:27,884
taking all of this into consideration,
shall rule as follows.

247
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:29,553
We pronounce...

248
00:17:30,595 --> 00:17:32,180
defendant Yang Seungbin

249
00:17:33,223 --> 00:17:34,933
not guilty.

250

[people gasping]

251
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,357
However, considering
the defendant's mental disability,

252
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,818
we order two years of treatment
under custody.

253

00:17:50,991 --> 00:17:52,492

255
00:17:55,453 --> 00:17:56,538
[spectator 2] How can he be not guilty?

256
00:17:56,621 --> 00:17:58,164
[spectator 3] Let's go. This is absurd.

257
00:17:58,248 --> 00:17:59,374

How could you do this?

260
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:15,390
He killed three people.

261
00:18:15,974 --> 00:18:17,684
How can he be not guilty?

262
00:18:20,729 --> 00:18:23,190
If it were your beloved family
that was killed,

263
00:18:24,524 --> 00:18:28,403
would you have made the same ruling?

There's proof he was of sound mind,
but you ordered treatment under custody?

273
00:19:39,766 --> 00:19:40,809
Why?

274
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:44,354
The evidence is inadmissible.

275
00:19:44,437 --> 00:19:47,566
So in this trial, he does have
a mental disability.

276
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:51,152
Still, with such a crappy ruling...

277

if Yang Seungbin comes back alive.

544
00:40:34,729 --> 00:40:36,147
DONGHUN

545
00:40:37,357 --> 00:40:39,484
Donghun, what is it?

546
00:41:05,051 --> 00:41:06,720
This seal again on the forehead.

547
00:41:06,803 --> 00:41:07,888
It's the same person.

548
00:41:12,976 --> 00:41:15,187
A passing truck found him around 5 a.m.

549
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:17,355
He's been stabbed all over.

550
00:41:19,149 --> 00:41:20,192
Gosh.

551
00:41:21,234 --> 00:41:23,028
Are you listening to me?

552
00:41:23,111 --> 00:41:25,488
NOBONG DISTRICT

553
00:41:25,572 --> 00:41:26,573
[scoffs]

554
00:41:27,782 --> 00:41:30,285
They left the body
in our jurisdiction on purpose.

555
00:41:31,328 --> 00:41:32,537
[Eunseop] This is the third time.

556
00:41:32,621 --> 00:41:34,831
[Soyeong] What's the motive behind this?

557
00:41:35,916 --> 00:41:37,751
Good work so far.

558
00:41:37,834 --> 00:41:39,878
-We didn't really do anything.
-Yes.

559
00:41:39,961 --> 00:41:42,339
That's why I said good work.

560
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:46,134
-[chuckles] Eat up.
-Okay.

561
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:49,262
[anchor on TV] <i>The body of Yang,
who murdered his family,</i>

562
00:41:49,346 --> 00:41:51,264
<i>was found a day after his kidnapping.</i>

563
00:41:51,348 --> 00:41:54,017
<i>The police are on the case.
Reporter Ahn Jeongho has more.</i>

564
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,479
<i>Mr. Yang was kidnapped while being
transported to a treatment cell.</i>

565
00:41:57,562 --> 00:41:59,689
<i>His body was found at 5 a.m. today.</i>

566
00:41:59,773 --> 00:42:03,235
<i>The police have requested an autopsy,
but as the body is severely damaged,</i>

567
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:06,363
<i>it will take considerable time
to determine the exact cause of death.</i>

568
00:42:06,446 --> 00:42:07,906
<i>-Ahn Jeongho, SBC News.</i>
-[Judge Kang chuckling]

569
00:42:09,366 --> 00:42:11,910
You have to break up
beef blood like this...

570
00:42:15,997 --> 00:42:18,500
To enjoy it properly. [chuckles]

571
00:42:26,883 --> 00:42:27,884
[chuckles]

572
00:42:42,983 --> 00:42:46,570
Why aren't you having more?

573
00:42:47,779 --> 00:42:49,239
To live longer.

574
00:42:50,907 --> 00:42:52,534
[both laughing]

575
00:42:52,659 --> 00:42:56,288
Of course. A great man like you
must live as long as possible.

576
00:42:59,749 --> 00:43:01,751
About the thing with Judge Kang,

577
00:43:02,669 --> 00:43:04,421
I'm a bit late, but thank you.

578
00:43:04,504 --> 00:43:06,131
Please, don't mention it.

579
00:43:06,214 --> 00:43:11,178
I think of Judge Kang
as my adopted daughter.

580
00:43:11,261 --> 00:43:13,305
[both laughing]

581
00:43:13,722 --> 00:43:14,931
Anyway, sir,

582
00:43:15,015 --> 00:43:19,936
may I ask why you're so generous
to Judge Kang...

583
00:43:20,854 --> 00:43:23,940
-If not, I won't.
-[Jaegeol chuckles]

584
00:43:25,150 --> 00:43:26,318
It's all right.

585
00:43:27,611 --> 00:43:28,862
Judge Kang...

586
00:43:29,654 --> 00:43:32,032
is very special to me.

587
00:43:32,157 --> 00:43:36,870
Oh. From now on,
I will be better to her...

588
00:43:36,953 --> 00:43:39,122
I mean, I'll look after her more.

589
00:43:39,623 --> 00:43:42,709
-[chuckles]
-Good.

590
00:43:42,792 --> 00:43:45,921
By the way, why is Judge Kang

591
00:43:46,004 --> 00:43:49,966
living in a place like Hwangcheon?

592
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:51,676
Is that where she's living?

593
00:43:52,511 --> 00:43:55,722
I'm sure it's because
she spends all her money on clothes.

594
00:43:55,805 --> 00:43:57,641
The way she dresses is so...

595
00:43:59,643 --> 00:44:01,478
Oh... Excuse me.

596
00:44:01,561 --> 00:44:02,854
-Apologies.
-[chuckles]

597
00:44:02,938 --> 00:44:05,065
It's all right. Please, eat.

598
00:44:05,148 --> 00:44:06,149
Yes, sir.

599
00:44:07,108 --> 00:44:08,944
Who did the job this time?

600
00:44:09,528 --> 00:44:13,823
Some guys I'm close with in Busan.
Why do you ask?

601
00:44:13,907 --> 00:44:16,952
I told you to make sure no one got hurt.

602
00:44:17,035 --> 00:44:19,579
They moved people away
so they wouldn't get hurt.

603
00:44:20,163 --> 00:44:21,665
Han Daon got hurt.

604
00:44:21,748 --> 00:44:23,500
Why did they beat him like that?

605
00:44:25,126 --> 00:44:26,419
I'm sorry.

606
00:44:27,003 --> 00:44:28,421
It's ready.

607
00:44:31,174 --> 00:44:32,217
Hey.

608
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,261
Who uses that kind of font
for a presentation?

609
00:44:34,344 --> 00:44:36,304
What are you thinking?

610
00:44:36,388 --> 00:44:39,432
It's fine.
At least he can write Korean. Begin.

611
00:44:39,516 --> 00:44:41,601
It was my first time, so...

612
00:44:41,685 --> 00:44:42,811
All right.

613
00:44:42,894 --> 00:44:44,855
"Who is Kang Bitna? I'd like to know."

614
00:44:44,938 --> 00:44:46,815
First, her name is Kang Bitna.

615
00:44:46,898 --> 00:44:48,275
-Age...
-Wait.

616
00:44:48,358 --> 00:44:50,068
Is it all like that?

617
00:44:50,151 --> 00:44:51,903
There are ten slides in total.

618
00:44:51,987 --> 00:44:53,572
[Judge Kang and Arong sigh]

619
00:44:53,655 --> 00:44:55,448
I just need the main points.

620
00:44:56,199 --> 00:44:59,619
Right. Then you can read this later.

621
00:44:59,703 --> 00:45:04,082
I went to the high school Kang Bitna
graduated from to do some research.

622
00:45:04,165 --> 00:45:05,667
She had no friends.

623
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,627
She was a serious student
who only studied.

624
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:10,714
And after her family sent her to college,

625
00:45:10,797 --> 00:45:12,090
they all moved abroad.

626
00:45:13,216 --> 00:45:15,343
No friends or family?

627
00:45:15,427 --> 00:45:17,053
What was her reputation as a judge?

628
00:45:17,137 --> 00:45:19,431
It wasn't bad when she was a judge.

629
00:45:19,514 --> 00:45:22,184
But she wasn't that just either.
She was just...

630
00:45:22,267 --> 00:45:26,146
Oh, right.
This was a photo of her before she died.

631
00:45:28,899 --> 00:45:30,859
Why are her clothes so drab?

632
00:45:30,942 --> 00:45:32,402
That's just how judges dress.

633
00:45:32,485 --> 00:45:34,529
-Only you put on a fashion show.
-What?

634
00:45:35,113 --> 00:45:36,948
-Question.
-[Mando] Okay.

635
00:45:37,991 --> 00:45:40,368
Who stabbed Kang Bitna?

636
00:45:40,452 --> 00:45:42,829
That's classified as a cold case.

637
00:45:42,913 --> 00:45:44,456
And the investigation is closed.

638
00:45:44,539 --> 00:45:45,832
Another question.

639
00:45:46,374 --> 00:45:49,544
Why did she break off her engagement
to Assemblyman Jeong's son?

640
00:45:51,588 --> 00:45:52,839
Well, that's...

641
00:45:52,923 --> 00:45:56,384
I had no way to find that out.
There was no one I could ask.

642
00:45:57,177 --> 00:45:58,178
Hey.

643
00:45:58,803 --> 00:46:01,223
You couldn't even find that out
as a TV producer?

644
00:46:03,225 --> 00:46:04,684
It's not that surprising.

645
00:46:04,768 --> 00:46:06,520
Stop picking on me.

646
00:46:06,978 --> 00:46:09,481
Did you just talk back to me, punk?

647
00:46:09,564 --> 00:46:11,525
I'm going to rip that mouth off.

648
00:46:12,317 --> 00:46:13,360
Rip it out?

649
00:46:13,443 --> 00:46:14,569
This explains the rumors.

650
00:46:14,653 --> 00:46:18,073
Justitia, do you know
what the other demons are saying?

651
00:46:18,156 --> 00:46:20,283
They think Arong is Satan.

652
00:46:20,367 --> 00:46:22,202
She got a bad temper and a foul mouth.

653
00:46:22,285 --> 00:46:23,411
What did you say?

654
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:25,121
Satan, be gone!

655
00:46:25,205 --> 00:46:26,957
-[screaming]
-Stop it. Stop it!

656
00:46:27,791 --> 00:46:29,042
Both of you, sit.

657
00:46:45,725 --> 00:46:47,561
[Eunseop] The first autopsy report is out.

658
00:46:47,644 --> 00:46:49,813
He likely died from excessive blood loss.

659
00:46:50,564 --> 00:46:53,191
And that marking
is the same as the others, right?

660
00:46:53,275 --> 00:46:54,693
Yes.

661
00:46:54,776 --> 00:46:56,778
How can there be no trace?

662
00:46:57,362 --> 00:46:59,155
Should we go to a fortune teller?

663
00:46:59,239 --> 00:47:01,032
That could work. Back in the day,

664
00:47:01,116 --> 00:47:05,370
when officers got really stuck,
they went to shamans and used talismans.

665
00:47:05,453 --> 00:47:09,457
[Soyeong] Do you really think shamanism
is appropriate in this day and age?

666
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:12,002
I'm just so frustrated.

667
00:47:13,962 --> 00:47:15,589
{\an8}SOCIAL WORKER KO YUNSEONG

668
00:47:19,384 --> 00:47:23,305
[Yunseong's colleague]
<i>Yunseong took his own life not long ago.</i>

669
00:47:24,764 --> 00:47:26,141
<i>He was a good person.</i>

670
00:47:26,641 --> 00:47:28,018
ELDERLY SUPPORT

671
00:47:30,353 --> 00:47:33,273
You saw me cry. What are you going to do?

672
00:47:34,482 --> 00:47:35,984
Are you going to tell on me?

673
00:47:36,067 --> 00:47:39,029
That you saw me cry,
so I should be killed?

674
00:47:42,449 --> 00:47:43,450
It can't be.

675
00:48:08,725 --> 00:48:09,726
Who is it?

676
00:48:12,771 --> 00:48:14,022
[Arong] Mr. Ko.

677
00:48:16,066 --> 00:48:17,275
It's me, Uijeongbu.

678
00:48:20,237 --> 00:48:23,031
It's so rude of you
to come into my house when I'm away.

679
00:48:25,075 --> 00:48:27,327
You left me no choice.

680
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:33,458
You've been together for three years.

681
00:48:34,125 --> 00:48:36,670
How is it? Is it nice to date a human?

682
00:48:37,254 --> 00:48:39,548
Is it more thrilling than killing sinners?

683
00:48:39,631 --> 00:48:41,049
How did you know?

684
00:48:42,592 --> 00:48:44,803
I followed Han Daon to keep an eye on him.

685
00:48:44,886 --> 00:48:47,806
You saw me cry. What are you going to do?

686
00:48:51,142 --> 00:48:52,811
{\an8}Are you going to tell on me?

687
00:48:53,311 --> 00:48:55,021
And caught a bigger fish instead.

688
00:48:56,147 --> 00:48:58,191
<i>I've been watching you.</i>

689
00:49:00,318 --> 00:49:02,237
<i>And you were having the best time</i>

690
00:49:03,029 --> 00:49:04,072
<i>of your life.</i>

691
00:49:04,531 --> 00:49:05,782
Uijeongbu, you...

692
00:49:06,533 --> 00:49:07,868
I'm not Uijeongbu.

693
00:49:10,495 --> 00:49:13,081
Killing sinners in Uijeongbu...

694
00:49:14,916 --> 00:49:16,418
is not my mission.

695
00:49:16,501 --> 00:49:18,003
Secretly tracking down

696
00:49:18,128 --> 00:49:21,756
pathetic demons who've become humanized
or fallen in love like you.

697
00:49:23,091 --> 00:49:24,259
That's my mission.

698
00:49:28,597 --> 00:49:29,723
Venato?

699
00:49:30,432 --> 00:49:31,433
You've tricked me!

700
00:49:31,558 --> 00:49:33,560
What if your lover becomes miserable?

701
00:49:34,227 --> 00:49:36,730
It's easy to torture her
until she begs for death.

702
00:49:38,315 --> 00:49:41,693
How about I tell her
that her boyfriend is a murderer

703
00:49:41,776 --> 00:49:44,696
who secretly goes around
killing people with this blade?

704
00:49:47,532 --> 00:49:49,826
There should be no secrets between lovers.

705
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:53,705
[crying]

706
00:49:53,788 --> 00:49:58,668
[laughs] You don't even hide
your tears anymore.

707
00:50:01,004 --> 00:50:03,798
Crawl quietly back to Hell and be tried.

708
00:50:03,882 --> 00:50:05,884
Then your girlfriend will be safe.

709
00:50:08,136 --> 00:50:09,387
Do you promise?

710
00:50:09,471 --> 00:50:10,555
Yes.

711
00:50:28,490 --> 00:50:29,950
[people gasping]

712
00:50:31,451 --> 00:50:32,702
-[bystander 1] Oh, no.
-[bystander 2] Call 911!

713
00:50:32,786 --> 00:50:33,954
[bystander 3] Oh, my goodness!

714
00:50:34,037 --> 00:50:36,164
-[bystander 1] Please hurry!
-[bystander 2] Oh, no!

715
00:50:36,831 --> 00:50:40,460
-[bystander 3] Oh, no.
-[bystander 4] Please come quick! Hurry!

716
00:50:43,255 --> 00:50:44,506
Is anyone there?

717
00:50:49,636 --> 00:50:51,096
-[devil 1] Hello, Gremory.
-[devil 2] Hello, Gremory.

718
00:50:52,472 --> 00:50:53,473
What?

719
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:57,727
Good job cleaning up.
But why are you here?

720
00:50:57,811 --> 00:50:59,980
While cleaning up this case,

721
00:51:00,063 --> 00:51:01,189
there was...

722
00:51:01,273 --> 00:51:03,316
There was something strange...

723
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,277
School's out soon. I'm busy.

724
00:51:05,360 --> 00:51:06,987
-Speed it up.
-Yes, ma'am.

725
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:11,658
We thought she'd be done by midnight,
but she kept going even when morning came.

726
00:51:11,741 --> 00:51:13,743
We got hungry waiting,
so we ate some <i>ramyeon.</i>

727
00:51:13,827 --> 00:51:14,953
Skip the boring parts.

728
00:51:15,036 --> 00:51:16,371
Right, boring...

729
00:51:16,454 --> 00:51:17,914
Which part is fun, then?

730
00:51:17,998 --> 00:51:18,999
From around 4 a.m.

731
00:51:19,082 --> 00:51:21,167
So we went in to work around four.

732
00:51:27,591 --> 00:51:30,260
Justitia said to only remove his shirt.

733
00:51:31,553 --> 00:51:33,722
-Is she a pervert?
-Total pervert.

734
00:51:33,805 --> 00:51:34,806
Right?

735
00:51:34,890 --> 00:51:37,100
-He's a mess.
<i>-[devil</i> 1] <i>The body was so messed up.</i>

736
00:51:37,184 --> 00:51:39,769
It was unusual.
It was very emotionally charged.

737
00:51:39,853 --> 00:51:41,855
Wait. Say that again in normal speed.

738
00:51:42,689 --> 00:51:46,651
It was very emotionally charged.

739
00:51:47,819 --> 00:51:49,321
Emotional?

740
00:51:49,404 --> 00:51:50,488
What emotion?

741
00:52:08,048 --> 00:52:11,009
I'll just pack some clothes and valuables.

742
00:52:27,692 --> 00:52:28,735
[Eunjoo's mother] Eunjoo.

743
00:52:29,277 --> 00:52:32,239
He's... dead.

744
00:52:33,323 --> 00:52:34,449
But...

745
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,245
I don't know

746
00:52:39,454 --> 00:52:41,915
why I'm not happy.

747
00:52:44,084 --> 00:52:47,254
I wanted to see him

748
00:52:48,004 --> 00:52:49,506
beg for forgiveness.

749
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:51,550
I wanted to see...

750
00:52:52,968 --> 00:52:55,220
him tried and punished properly...

751
00:52:57,180 --> 00:53:00,308
for what he did.

752
00:53:06,606 --> 00:53:07,858
Eunjoo...

753
00:53:08,692 --> 00:53:10,986

757
00:53:45,103 --> 00:53:46,104
Why are you here?

758
00:53:46,188 --> 00:53:49,274
I heard the victims' family was
coming to pack up their things.

759
00:53:50,025 --> 00:53:51,484
I was curious about their reaction.

760
00:53:52,777 --> 00:53:55,655
They were so happy
that they were crying out loud.

761
00:53:55,739 --> 00:53:56,865
Happy?

762
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:59,451
You thought those were happy tears?

763
00:54:00,577 --> 00:54:02,954
Then are they sad?
When the bad guy is dead?

764
00:54:06,416 --> 00:54:10,045
Why did you leave
Yang Seungbin's body in my jurisdiction?

765
00:54:11,171 --> 00:54:12,714
Do you have proof I did that?

766
00:54:12,797 --> 00:54:14,466
Why did you kill Yunseong?

767
00:54:14,549 --> 00:54:16,218
Who's Yunseong?

768
00:54:16,301 --> 00:54:17,802
The president of the volunteer group.

769
00:54:18,637 --> 00:54:20,430
He's dead? When?

770
00:54:20,555 --> 00:54:23,058
[scoffs] Rude.
Going back without saying goodbye?

771
00:54:23,141 --> 00:54:24,768
Did you kill him because he's a bad guy?

772
00:54:24,851 --> 00:54:26,144
I never killed him.

773
00:54:26,228 --> 00:54:28,021
I only just found out he died.

774
00:54:28,104 --> 00:54:30,774
Stop lying. I know you killed him.

775
00:54:30,857 --> 00:54:32,984
Did you make it
look like a suicide to cover it up?

776
00:54:33,068 --> 00:54:35,737
What are you talking about? Suicide?

777
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:37,948
Why not pick up a different hobby?

778
00:54:38,031 --> 00:54:39,991
One that doesn't involve murder.

779
00:54:40,075 --> 00:54:42,118
Wait. You can't because you're a demon?

780
00:54:42,202 --> 00:54:43,954
Because you can do all bad things

781
00:54:44,037 --> 00:54:46,164
and rationalize it
by saying you're a demon.

782
00:54:46,790 --> 00:54:48,833
How can you say such a thing?

783
00:54:48,917 --> 00:54:49,960
What?

784
00:54:50,627 --> 00:54:53,797
You hurt people
with your words all the time.

785
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,883
-But you can't take it?
-[chuckles]

786
00:54:58,468 --> 00:55:01,137
Stop overreacting
and go back to your usual self.

787
00:55:01,221 --> 00:55:03,139
You're terribly boring right now.

788
00:55:04,140 --> 00:55:05,141
I...

789
00:55:05,725 --> 00:55:07,435
I'm going to catch you.

790

And once I do,

791
00:55:10,021 --> 00:55:11,481
I'm not letting you go.

792
00:55:25,579 --> 00:55:28,164
It sucks to be blamed
for something I didn't do.

Let's enjoy a drink first.

796
00:55:48,768 --> 00:55:49,769
I'm leaving.

797
00:55:50,395 --> 00:55:54,065
I heard you asked my father
to transfer you

798
00:55:54,149 --> 00:55:55,400
to collegiate court.

799
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:01,656
I just asked for a favor.

800
00:56:03,825 --> 00:56:04,951
Let me be honest.

801
00:56:06,203 --> 00:56:08,872
You make me uncomfortable.

802
00:56:08,955 --> 00:56:11,917
[chuckles] Right. Because of our breakup?

803
00:56:12,751 --> 00:56:13,835
How tacky.

804
00:56:14,961 --> 00:56:18,423
I don't want you to involve yourself

805
00:56:18,507 --> 00:56:19,883
with my family anymore.

806
00:56:19,966 --> 00:56:22,677
Just tell your father to stop calling me.

807
00:56:23,929 --> 00:56:27,557
By the way, why does he keep
telling to move, mentioning redevelopment?

808
00:56:27,641 --> 00:56:31,895
I'm the CEO of the company
that's seeking to redevelop Hwangcheon.

809

-Then give up. I'm staying put.
