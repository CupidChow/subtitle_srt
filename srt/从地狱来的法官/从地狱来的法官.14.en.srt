What is this place?

186
00:16:14,853 --> 00:16:16,938
You killed a total of 14 people.

187
00:16:17,022 --> 00:16:19,941
If we exclude Jeong Seonho's mother
and Inspector Kim Soyeong,

188
00:16:20,025 --> 00:16:22,736
there are 12 victims
of the J serial killings.

189
00:16:22,819 --> 00:16:23,945
[Taegyu] Shit.

190
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:25,113
Jeong Jaegeol told me

191
00:16:26,114 --> 00:16:28,283
that you enjoyed the hunt.

192
00:16:28,825 --> 00:16:31,953
So I'm going to hunt you now.

193
00:16:32,037 --> 00:16:33,163

194

195

It will end too soon.

201
00:16:50,555 --> 00:16:52,641

Don't worry.
I'm actually quite a humanitarian.

218

I'll get you this time.

[Judge Kang] How does it feel
being in Hell?

227
00:19:08,026 --> 00:19:09,027
Father?

228
00:19:11,321 --> 00:19:12,322
[Judge Kang] Welcome.

229
00:19:13,198 --> 00:19:16,243
Now that's a cold father-son reunion.

230
00:19:16,326 --> 00:19:17,369
How have you been?

231
00:19:18,245 --> 00:19:21,831
Stop glaring.
I called you here to give you a gift.

232
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:32,008
You trusted him, but he betrayed you,
and now you're in Hell.

233
00:19:32,092 --> 00:19:33,593
You must have been so angry.

234
00:19:33,677 --> 00:19:35,887
You probably vowed to kill him

235
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:37,639
if you ever saw him again.

236
00:19:42,561 --> 00:19:45,230
I'll give you a chance for revenge.
There's only one rule.

237

Whoever kills the other first, wins.

[Taegyu chuckles]

244
00:20:17,345 --> 00:20:18,930
[Taegyu] Father, just think of it

245

as sacrificing yourself for your child.

246

Don't feel too bad.

247

[in demonic voice] I won't.

248

00:42:40,647 --> 00:42:43,233
Hey! Did I say I'd pay you back or not?

543
00:42:43,316 --> 00:42:45,277
Yeah, you've been saying that
for 12 months!

544
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,404
[defendant] I said
I'd pay you back this month!

545
00:42:47,487 --> 00:42:48,822
[plaintiff] And pick up your phone!

546
00:42:52,784 --> 00:42:54,160
[employee] Judge Kang!

547
00:42:54,244 --> 00:42:55,287
Oh, no.

548
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,747
Look at those bags under your eyes.

549
00:42:57,831 --> 00:43:00,041
They must be weighing you down.

550
00:43:00,125 --> 00:43:01,376
Goodness.

551
00:43:01,459 --> 00:43:03,545
How are they now?

552
00:43:04,129 --> 00:43:05,338
A bit better.

553
00:43:05,422 --> 00:43:07,924
-You're still pretty anyway.
-[both chuckle]

554
00:43:08,508 --> 00:43:09,509
[softly] I know.

555
00:43:09,593 --> 00:43:13,138
Oh, right. Judge Kang,
that man is here again.

556
00:43:13,847 --> 00:43:15,265
What was his name again?

557
00:43:15,348 --> 00:43:16,766
Right, fabric softener!

558
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:18,185
Ah. [chuckles]

559
00:43:18,894 --> 00:43:19,895
See you.

560
00:43:29,487 --> 00:43:30,655
Did you wait long?

561
00:43:30,739 --> 00:43:32,949
I fell asleep waiting for you.

562
00:43:33,533 --> 00:43:35,202
-What?
-[both chuckle]

563
00:43:36,411 --> 00:43:38,580
[Daon] Should I apply
to be transferred here?

564
00:43:39,831 --> 00:43:41,541
There's only one year left now.

565
00:43:43,293 --> 00:43:45,921
Sorry, I should've requested time off.

566
00:43:46,796 --> 00:43:49,799
[Daon] You said you wanted to live
the life of a real judge.

567
00:43:49,883 --> 00:43:52,552
That's cool. I respect you for it.

568
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:54,429
Still...

569
00:43:55,347 --> 00:43:57,891
I'm being too selfish, aren't I?

570
00:43:57,974 --> 00:44:00,602
It's all right. You were always selfish.

571
00:44:03,647 --> 00:44:04,648
[Daon groans softly]

572
00:44:05,857 --> 00:44:07,442
Control your strength. Please.

573
00:44:07,526 --> 00:44:09,027
I thought my arm fell off.

574
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:11,112
Goodness! Do you want me to blow on it?

575
00:44:13,323 --> 00:44:15,033
Not here, but...

576
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:16,701
here.

577
00:44:18,578 --> 00:44:20,830
[Judge Kang] It's too crowded here.

578
00:44:21,498 --> 00:44:23,208
But I don't care about that.

579
00:44:24,626 --> 00:44:25,919
[both chuckle]

580
00:44:33,927 --> 00:44:34,928
[phone buzzing]

581
00:44:37,097 --> 00:44:40,058
-[sighs] Seriously? Talk about timing.
-[Daon clears throat]

582
00:44:41,393 --> 00:44:42,727
I'm busy. Get to it.

583
00:44:46,189 --> 00:44:47,190
So suddenly?

584
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:51,570
All right.

585
00:44:53,446 --> 00:44:55,490
-[call disconnects]
-Oh, my.

586
00:44:56,324 --> 00:44:57,325
What is it?

587
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:01,079
I've been transferred back
to Seoul Central Court.

588
00:45:01,162 --> 00:45:02,414
Really?

589
00:45:02,497 --> 00:45:05,250
-[chuckles]
-Is there anyone you've missed?

590
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:07,794
Not me. That's obvious.

591
00:45:08,628 --> 00:45:10,505
I'm not sure if I miss them.

592
00:45:10,589 --> 00:45:12,966
But I have been curious
about how they're doing.

593
00:45:16,511 --> 00:45:17,804
I have to pack again.

594
00:45:17,888 --> 00:45:18,972
[Daon] I'll help you.

595
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:25,729
CHA MINJEONG

596
00:45:29,774 --> 00:45:32,652
Ms. Cha. Let's go eat, too.

597
00:45:32,736 --> 00:45:35,405
Right. Should we?

598
00:45:35,488 --> 00:45:36,489
[colleague] Yes.

599
00:45:36,573 --> 00:45:37,616
[Minjeong] Just a moment.

600
00:45:37,699 --> 00:45:39,826
MANAGEMENT SUPPORT TEAM
MANAGER CHA MINJEONG

601
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:40,911
[Minjeong] Let's go.

602
00:45:41,578 --> 00:45:42,829
-[colleague] Really?
-Eat loads there.

603
00:45:42,913 --> 00:45:44,456
-It's all so good.
-Excuse me.

604
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:46,958
We didn't order this.

605
00:45:47,042 --> 00:45:48,960
A woman over there sent it over.

606
00:45:49,044 --> 00:45:51,713
She paid for your meal, too.

607
00:45:52,881 --> 00:45:53,882
What?

608
00:45:53,965 --> 00:45:55,008
She left.

609
00:45:57,052 --> 00:45:58,094
Enjoy.

610
00:46:08,146 --> 00:46:09,231
[Judge Kang] Mm!

611
00:46:09,814 --> 00:46:11,608
They say you lose your taste as you age.

612
00:46:11,691 --> 00:46:14,110
But you still got it.
It's seasoned just right.

613
00:46:14,194 --> 00:46:16,071
What a ridiculous thing to say.

614
00:46:16,154 --> 00:46:17,948
Do you ever stop yakking?

615
00:46:18,031 --> 00:46:19,741
Here. Take these side dishes with you.

616
00:46:19,824 --> 00:46:23,662
You have to eat well if you're going
to be a judge until you drop dead.

617
00:46:24,287 --> 00:46:26,915
[yells] You punk!
Don't toss your cigarette butt there!

618
00:46:26,998 --> 00:46:28,500
Come back here!

619
00:46:37,175 --> 00:46:38,301
Ms. Kang.

620
00:46:38,385 --> 00:46:41,596
This time, it looks just like you.

621
00:46:42,514 --> 00:46:43,515
Really?

622
00:46:46,518 --> 00:46:48,770
{\an8}JUDGE, I MISSED YOU

623
00:46:53,567 --> 00:46:54,568
Hey, kid.

624
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:58,321
Can you promise me
you'll only draw as a hobby?

625
00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:02,367
Okay. I will draw you again
as a hobby next time!

626
00:47:03,451 --> 00:47:05,579
Again?

627
00:47:05,662 --> 00:47:06,663
Okay!

628
00:47:07,956 --> 00:47:11,126
If you're asking
if I've put it all behind me,

629
00:47:12,085 --> 00:47:13,795
I have not.

630
00:47:15,213 --> 00:47:18,717
When you lose your child
and grandchildren,

631
00:47:20,886 --> 00:47:23,763
you're just never the same again.

632
00:47:26,057 --> 00:47:27,976
-[Eunju's sister] Mom...
-[chuckles]

633
00:47:28,393 --> 00:47:32,606
But these days, I laugh when I watch TV

634
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:36,526
and go out with my friends.

635
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:37,944
At first,

636
00:47:38,987 --> 00:47:43,241
every breath I took
was weighed with guilt.

637
00:47:46,077 --> 00:47:49,456
But you have gotten better
in the last two years.

638
00:47:50,081 --> 00:47:51,833
And you'll continue to get better.

639
00:47:53,418 --> 00:47:54,419
[Eunju's mother] I hope so.

[Eunju's mother] My daughter

642
00:47:58,465 --> 00:48:02,511
would want me to live

643
00:48:02,594 --> 00:48:03,595

00:48:18,068 --> 00:48:19,778
-Hello.
-Hello.

648
00:48:19,861 --> 00:48:21,196
Here, let me.

649
00:48:21,821 --> 00:48:22,948
No, it's all right.

650
00:48:23,031 --> 00:48:25,242
-It's not too heavy today.
-Still.

651
00:48:25,700 --> 00:48:28,912
-[chuckles] Yours, too.
-Gosh, I'm fine.

652
00:48:28,995 --> 00:48:30,455
-Let's go.
-[Yugyeong] But...

653
00:48:32,123 --> 00:48:33,458
[Yugyeong's mother] Gosh, I feel bad.

654
00:48:36,962 --> 00:48:38,547
That seems dangerous.

655
00:48:38,630 --> 00:48:40,090
What should we do about him?

656
00:48:41,049 --> 00:48:42,217
What did he say?

657
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:47,222
"I want to enjoy the little things in life
with the person I love," he said.

658
00:48:47,305 --> 00:48:48,557
He must be crazy.

659
00:48:49,224 --> 00:48:52,435
Mando's the one you should
really be worried about. [chuckling]

660
00:48:53,228 --> 00:48:54,688
-What's wrong with him?
-Well...

661
00:48:57,691 --> 00:48:59,651
[bell tolling]

662
00:49:17,335 --> 00:49:20,797
Venerable, I heard your nose bled
while preparing for the service.

663
00:49:20,881 --> 00:49:24,718
Even a nosebleed is Buddha's blessing.

664
00:49:24,801 --> 00:49:26,178
[chuckles]

665
00:49:26,261 --> 00:49:28,555
I admire your valiant devotion.

666
00:49:30,557 --> 00:49:32,058
Wait, Venerable.

667
00:49:33,268 --> 00:49:37,105
If I keep this up,
I will go to Paradise, right?

668
00:49:41,193 --> 00:49:42,611
Will I?

669
00:49:43,195 --> 00:49:44,196
Venerable!

670
00:49:44,279 --> 00:49:45,572

-Wait a moment.

00:50:32,494 --> 00:50:35,747
-many happy returns!
-[all] Cheers!

689
00:50:43,755 --> 00:50:45,173
You haven't changed.

690
00:50:45,924 --> 00:50:47,551
But you have, I see.

691
00:50:47,634 --> 00:50:48,802
-[Mando] I haven't.
-[Arong exclaims]

692
00:50:49,261 --> 00:50:51,596
-[Mando chuckles]
-Ta-da.

693
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,598
{\an8}-[Mando exclaims]
-I tried these last time.

694
00:50:53,682 --> 00:50:55,767
They're spicy and perfect for drinking.

695
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:58,228
-Try them.
-[all] Okay.

696
00:50:58,979 --> 00:51:00,689
This one is mala-flavored.

697
00:51:01,231 --> 00:51:02,440
Let's try it.

698
00:51:02,524 --> 00:51:03,775
You too. Here.

699
00:51:04,568 --> 00:51:05,610
Try it.

700
00:51:05,694 --> 00:51:06,695
Thank you.

701
00:51:09,531 --> 00:51:11,908
-[Judge Kang] Mmm.
-Good, right?

702
00:51:17,038 --> 00:51:19,040
[♪ soft music playing]

703
00:51:29,634 --> 00:51:32,637
-[Minjun] Should I go get some more cola?
-[Judge Kang] I'm fine.

704
00:51:32,721 --> 00:51:35,765
You're in high school now, right?
Are your grades better now?

705
00:51:36,349 --> 00:51:38,185
Well... yes.

706
00:51:38,268 --> 00:51:39,561
That's a no, then.

707
00:51:40,812 --> 00:51:44,441
But Detective Han helps him every week,
so he's doing much better.

708
00:51:44,524 --> 00:51:45,984
And he'll continue to improve.

709
00:51:46,067 --> 00:51:48,111
Yeah. Right. [chuckles nervously]

710
00:51:48,195 --> 00:51:51,781
-Goodness, you're scaring him, boss.
-[all chuckle]

711
00:51:52,532 --> 00:51:53,742
Are you a boss now?

712
00:51:53,825 --> 00:51:55,702
Well, I opened a small restaurant.

713
00:51:56,286 --> 00:51:59,247
Everyone here gets to eat for free.
Come anytime.

714
00:51:59,331 --> 00:52:01,041
-[Mando] Wow!
-[Arong] That's great!

715
00:52:01,124 --> 00:52:03,460
Don't just give food away for free.

716
00:52:03,543 --> 00:52:06,129
You'll never make enough money
and get rich.

717
00:52:06,213 --> 00:52:09,007

896

I will get them for sure. Don't stop me.

[Donghun] We won't, punk. Let's go!

What do you want to do?

910
01:05:33,770 --> 01:05:36,898
If I become human, I can live with you
for the rest of my life.

911
01:05:36,982 --> 01:05:37,983
But...

912
01:05:39,943 --> 01:05:41,236
I have to kill people.

913
01:05:42,404 --> 01:05:43,738
Ten in a year.

914
01:05:47,826 --> 01:05:50,412
I'm not afraid
that the police will catch me.

915
01:05:50,495 --> 01:05:52,372
I won't be caught anyway.

916
01:05:53,206 --> 01:05:54,749
Then what's troubling you?

917
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:00,338
To kill sinners,

918
01:06:00,422 --> 01:06:03,425
I have to hand down light sentences
and let them go.

919
01:06:03,508 --> 01:06:07,137
Then the victims and their families
will hurt again.

920
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:10,265
Doing that when I know
how they will feel is...

921
01:06:11,933 --> 01:06:14,227
That's not what a judge should do.

922
01:06:16,021 --> 01:06:17,647
You told me once

923
01:06:18,523 --> 01:06:20,233
that if I killed Jeong Taegyu,

924
01:06:20,317 --> 01:06:24,154
you would free me from jail
with everything you had as a demon

925
01:06:24,237 --> 01:06:26,448
and if I let Jeong Taegyu live,

926
01:06:26,531 --> 01:06:28,533
you'd give everything as a judge

927
01:06:28,617 --> 01:06:30,327
to lock him up.

928
01:06:32,662 --> 01:06:36,333
That no matter what choice I made,
you trusted me.

929
01:06:36,416 --> 01:06:38,376
So no matter what choice you make,

930
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:39,961
I trust you.

931
01:06:40,545 --> 01:06:44,382
I know you will make a wise decision.

932
01:06:47,928 --> 01:06:49,846
You're such a good person.

933
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:55,393

I have a drinking appointment after this.

944
01:07:58,623 --> 01:08:02,127
Defendant. Is that
the attitude of a repentant person?

945
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:05,088
Because you assaulted
and stalked the victim,

946
01:08:05,672 --> 01:08:09,134
she is badly injured
and still in the hospital.

947
01:08:12,929 --> 01:08:14,014

I am a judge. Look.

You all have discerning eyes.

Fine. What are you curious about?

990
01:10:11,590 --> 01:10:15,218
Why are her eyes covered
and why is she holding a sword?

991
01:10:15,302 --> 01:10:18,180
Only when her eyes are covered
can she make a fair judgement.

992
01:10:18,263 --> 01:10:21,766
She weighs the person's sins
on the scale to see how heavy they are.

993
01:10:21,850 --> 01:10:25,103
And she uses the sword
to punish them justly.

994
01:10:25,187 --> 01:10:27,063
But what is justice?

995
01:10:27,147 --> 01:10:30,984
When good people live happily
and bad people are punished,

996
01:10:31,067 --> 01:10:32,736
that is justice.

997
01:10:32,819 --> 01:10:36,364
Then are you a good judge or a bad judge?

01:10:38,742 --> 01:10:40,410
