00:14:03,054 --> 00:14:04,097
I see.

186
00:14:04,181 --> 00:14:05,682
You really didn't have to.

187
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:08,602
By the way, what are you wearing?

188
00:14:08,685 --> 00:14:11,313
-First, please let me bow to you.
-What?

189
00:14:21,781 --> 00:14:24,117
[Jaegeol] Judge Kang? What are you doing?

190
00:14:25,327 --> 00:14:26,494
Father.

191
00:14:26,578 --> 00:14:28,663
Please let me marry your son.

192
00:14:33,752 --> 00:14:34,753
[chuckles]

193
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:44,137
I'm sure you're wondering
why I'm suddenly asking to marry your son.

194
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,933
I haven't thought about it much so far,

195
00:14:48,016 --> 00:14:49,726
but I realize now.

196
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:51,645
What it is I have to do.

197
00:14:52,395 --> 00:14:54,606
Is that marrying my son?

198
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:58,318
To be exact, it's attaining success
and wealth through the marriage.

199
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:00,570
I want to go into politics.

200
00:15:00,654 --> 00:15:03,156
-[scoffs]
-[Judge Kang] I'm a great liar, shameless,

201
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,824
selfish, hypocritical,

202
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:07,202
and I like money.

203
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:10,747
I think I have what it takes
to be a great politician.

204
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,333
You decided to break off
our engagement on your own.

205
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,418
Why are you doing this now?

206
00:15:16,044 --> 00:15:17,879
I'm not interested in you.

207
00:15:20,549 --> 00:15:21,800
He's...

208
00:15:21,883 --> 00:15:23,760
the one I want to marry.

209
00:15:29,641 --> 00:15:31,226
[laughing]

210
00:15:34,729 --> 00:15:35,939
Then...

211
00:15:37,232 --> 00:15:39,067
you two should get to know each other.

212
00:15:39,901 --> 00:15:42,779
-Father.
-[Jaegeol laughing]

213
00:15:48,285 --> 00:15:49,536
Gosh, how scary.

214
00:15:59,171 --> 00:16:03,592
-I need to use the ladies' room.
-[Jaegeol] Of course. [laughing]

215
00:16:43,006 --> 00:16:45,133
-How long have you been there?
-Since just now.

216
00:16:50,347 --> 00:16:51,473
What did you see?

217
00:16:51,556 --> 00:16:53,058
What should I have seen?

218
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:56,478
You really better stop now.

219
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:58,438
There's only so much I can stand.

220
00:16:59,356 --> 00:17:01,525
Can you get your ugly face out of mine?

221
00:17:01,608 --> 00:17:04,694
We're not even married yet.
Let's keep a safe distance.

222
00:17:09,741 --> 00:17:10,742
[scoffs]

223
00:17:29,052 --> 00:17:30,178
What about our agreement?

224
00:17:30,929 --> 00:17:32,597
Don't you know how to knock?

225
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:36,268
Who cares about that now?

226
00:17:38,395 --> 00:17:39,813
I haven't forgotten about it.

227
00:17:39,896 --> 00:17:41,481
How could I?

228
00:17:41,565 --> 00:17:44,025
Then why did you let
Kang Bitna back in here?

229
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:45,819
I think she may be useful.

230
00:17:45,902 --> 00:17:47,571
No, not to me.

231
00:17:47,654 --> 00:17:50,615
So you should've
gotten the redevelopment done already.

232
00:17:50,699 --> 00:17:51,867
That's the reason?

233
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,660
Jeong Taegyu.

234
00:17:55,203 --> 00:17:57,205
Do you want to go back to how things were?

235
00:17:58,748 --> 00:17:59,833
[Taegyu sighs]

236
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:04,796
If you keep acting as you like,

237
00:18:05,797 --> 00:18:07,424
you'll find yourself in trouble,

238
00:18:08,133 --> 00:18:09,134
Father.

239
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:15,265
-[door opens]
-[chuckles]

240
00:18:15,807 --> 00:18:17,392
-[door closes]
-[chuckling]

241
00:18:19,352 --> 00:18:21,146
IAN DAILY
REPORTER JO ARAN

242
00:18:25,025 --> 00:18:27,235
JUDGE KANG WAS BEHIND
JEONG'S LIGHT SENTENCE

243
00:18:27,319 --> 00:18:28,904
[Donghun] Reading your article,

244
00:18:28,987 --> 00:18:31,615
we assumed you must know Judge Kang well.

245
00:18:32,365 --> 00:18:34,075
I don't know her well.

246
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:36,328
I'm following her
as her rulings are absurd.

247
00:18:36,411 --> 00:18:38,163
Did you ever come across

248
00:18:38,246 --> 00:18:41,124
anything unusual about Judge Kang Bitna?

249
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:44,669
Do you know
that a few days after she was attacked,

250
00:18:44,753 --> 00:18:47,255
an article about her broken engagement

251
00:18:47,339 --> 00:18:48,757
-was published?
-Yes.

252
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,593
Isn't it strange
the two happened so close together?

253
00:18:51,676 --> 00:18:53,553
And an incumbent judge was stabbed,

254
00:18:53,637 --> 00:18:56,181
but the culprit still hasn't been caught.

255
00:18:57,057 --> 00:19:00,018
Then do you think the attack on Kang Bitna

256
00:19:00,101 --> 00:19:02,562
is related to Jeong Jaegeol's family?

257
00:19:02,646 --> 00:19:03,688
Yes.

258
00:19:03,772 --> 00:19:06,066
Then why haven't you written about it?

259
00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:07,275
I did.

260
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:09,486
But it was removed right away.

261
00:19:09,569 --> 00:19:12,113
I asked my company why
but got no straight answer.

262
00:19:12,739 --> 00:19:13,740
Oh, right.

263
00:19:13,823 --> 00:19:15,617
<i>When Judge Kang was attacked,</i>

264
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,161
<i>I heard she was taken
to Yeonseon University Hospital.</i>

265
00:19:20,747 --> 00:19:22,249
[Eunseop] The reporter was right.

266
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:24,709
Someone exerted their influence.

267
00:19:24,793 --> 00:19:26,169
Let's talk in the car.

268
00:19:26,253 --> 00:19:27,254
Okay.

269
00:19:30,382 --> 00:19:34,594
Kang Bitna left Jeong Taegyu's home
at 8 p.m. on December 19, 2023.

270
00:19:35,262 --> 00:19:39,558
And she was taken to the hospital
the next night, on the 20th at 9 p.m.

271
00:19:39,641 --> 00:19:42,769
Right before the incident,
Kang Bitna sent a text to Jeong Taegyu.

272
00:19:42,853 --> 00:19:45,272
And since then,
the two haven't contacted each other.

273
00:19:45,355 --> 00:19:48,650
They must have broken up
at Jeong's house the night before.

274
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:50,777
She could've asked to break up via text.

275
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:52,404
Either way, the conclusion is,

276
00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:55,031
Kang Bitna was stabbed
after the breakup was mentioned.

277
00:19:56,575 --> 00:19:58,702
Kang Bitna asked
to break off the engagement,

278
00:19:58,785 --> 00:20:00,912
and Jeong Taegyu got angry
and stabbed her?

279
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,208
Let's first check Jeong Taegyu's alibi
for that night.

280
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:07,711
Right. There's a junkie
in that family, right?

281
00:20:07,794 --> 00:20:09,546
-Check his alibi, too.
-Okay.

282
00:20:19,514 --> 00:20:20,515
Hey!

283
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:25,020
Are you going to ignore me?

284
00:20:26,396 --> 00:20:27,898
You ignored him first.

285
00:20:27,981 --> 00:20:29,774
Shut up, you little...

286
00:20:31,443 --> 00:20:32,527
Follow me, you bastard.

287
00:20:34,237 --> 00:20:36,531
Not you. You!

288
00:20:59,221 --> 00:21:00,514
[Daon] Slow down.

289
00:21:01,598 --> 00:21:02,641
You'll get indigestion.

290
00:21:08,104 --> 00:21:09,689
Why do you have to be so nice?

291
00:21:10,357 --> 00:21:13,485
I can't even hate you. [sighs]

292
00:21:21,034 --> 00:21:23,745
You know Judge Kang
was stabbed a while back, right?

293
00:21:23,828 --> 00:21:27,457
I think Jeong Jaegeol's family
is in some way related to that incident.

294
00:21:27,541 --> 00:21:29,626
But you're suspicious of Judge Kang.

295
00:21:30,669 --> 00:21:32,295
-So why are you...
-I am.

296
00:21:33,129 --> 00:21:34,965
I'm still suspicious of her.

297
00:21:35,048 --> 00:21:37,217
But I need to know why she was stabbed

298
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:39,469
and what kind of person she is

299
00:21:39,553 --> 00:21:42,514
to find any clues about the incident

300
00:21:42,597 --> 00:21:44,516
that I suspect she was involved in.

301
00:21:45,684 --> 00:21:46,935
That's why I'm doing this.

302
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,859
If Detective Kim was alive,
she would've told me to.

303
00:21:55,569 --> 00:21:58,113
Kang Bitna was the victim of that attack.

304
00:21:59,656 --> 00:22:01,741
So she would've told me
to catch the culprit.

305
00:22:03,326 --> 00:22:05,161
That it's an officer's job.

306
00:22:08,331 --> 00:22:09,332
Donghun.

307
00:22:14,462 --> 00:22:15,714
I'm sorry I hit you.

308
00:22:18,425 --> 00:22:19,426
It's all right.

309
00:22:23,972 --> 00:22:26,641
And I'm sorry I couldn't protect her.
[crying]

310
00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:34,316
What happened to Soyeong isn't your fault.

311
00:22:35,108 --> 00:22:37,110
[sobbing]

312
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,909
I'm really sorry.

313
00:22:48,914 --> 00:22:50,749
If you're sorry, you pay for dinner.

314
00:22:53,501 --> 00:22:54,628
[chuckles tearily] Gosh.

315
00:22:55,629 --> 00:22:57,297
-[chuckles]
-[Donghun] Here.

316
00:23:06,473 --> 00:23:08,642
<i>Meet Professor Lee Jihye
at Yeonseon Hospital.</i>

317
00:23:09,226 --> 00:23:11,853
She's the psychiatrist
who treated Kang Bitna back then.

318
00:23:11,937 --> 00:23:14,314
<i>She'd know well
about the night she was admitted.</i>

319
00:23:14,397 --> 00:23:16,650
YEONSEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

320
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:20,237
[Jihye] I can't share with you
information about the patient's treatment.

321
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,448
Professor, I really need
to catch the culprit.

322
00:23:23,532 --> 00:23:26,576
You're a police officer
who must catch the culprit.

323
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,870
And I'm a doctor
who must protect my patient.

324
00:23:28,954 --> 00:23:30,455
What should we do then?

325
00:23:31,748 --> 00:23:36,545
Then, the night Judge Kang was admitted,
was there anything unusual to note?

326
00:23:36,628 --> 00:23:38,713
Please tell me what you remember

327
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:40,674
within the scope of what you can say.

328
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:44,219
A man

329
00:23:44,302 --> 00:23:46,972
came looking for Kang Bitna.

330
00:23:48,974 --> 00:23:50,851
PATIENT: KANG BITNA

331
00:23:50,934 --> 00:23:54,020
-Can you check the rest at the desk?
-Yes, doctor.

332
00:23:54,104 --> 00:23:55,105
[Jihye] Thanks.

333
00:23:57,566 --> 00:23:59,484
-[Daon] Was it him?
-[Jihye] No.

334
00:24:02,571 --> 00:24:03,572
Then...

335
00:24:03,655 --> 00:24:05,407
Yes. It was him.

336
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:08,326
You said you only saw him briefly
a few months ago.

337
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:10,036
How do you remember his face?

338
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,955
[Jihye] <i>He seemed very anxious.</i>

339
00:24:12,038 --> 00:24:13,790
<i>As if he were guilty of something.</i>

340
00:24:23,008 --> 00:24:25,468
<i>I told the police I saw a suspicious man.</i>

341
00:24:25,552 --> 00:24:27,679
<i>But they said
the investigation was closed.</i>

342
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,226
Jeong Seonho killed me?

343
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:35,854
I mean... Kang Bitna?

344
00:24:35,937 --> 00:24:38,523
Yes. I'm sure he's J.

345
00:24:39,149 --> 00:24:40,358
Don't get close to him.

346
00:24:40,442 --> 00:24:41,902
But that's not enough.

347
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:44,446
We need more solid evidence.

348
00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:46,865
He killed Kang Bitna and Soyeong.

349
00:24:46,948 --> 00:24:50,243
And J's serial killings began
right after he returned from the US.

350
00:24:50,744 --> 00:24:51,745
He's a murderer.

351
00:24:51,828 --> 00:24:55,457
If Jeong Seonho is J
and the one who killed Kang Bitna,

352
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,501
why wasn't her body dismembered?

353
00:24:58,585 --> 00:24:59,961
That's true, but...

354
00:25:01,755 --> 00:25:03,757
We need to check and be more certain.

355
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,550
Is that why

356
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,220
you're trying to marry Jeong Seonho?

357
00:25:08,303 --> 00:25:10,222
I'm not really going to.

358
00:25:10,305 --> 00:25:12,891
I just need to get his guard down
to get closer.

359
00:25:12,974 --> 00:25:14,017
Still, I don't like it.

360
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,689
-Are you jealous?
-I'm worried.

361
00:25:20,815 --> 00:25:22,776
-That's disappointing.
-Half worried,

362
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:25,278
-half jealous.
-[chuckles]

363
00:25:29,324 --> 00:25:31,451
Just wait a bit longer.

364
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:35,038
-You trust me, right?
-I do,

365
00:25:35,747 --> 00:25:36,873
but I don't feel good.

366
00:25:39,042 --> 00:25:40,502
Then I should cheer you up.

367
00:25:47,843 --> 00:25:49,970
[exclaims] It looks great on you.

368
00:25:50,554 --> 00:25:52,973
Doesn't wearing <i>hanbok</i>
make you feel better?

369
00:25:53,056 --> 00:25:56,518
Well, it just seems like
we're doing this so you can feel better.

370
00:25:58,311 --> 00:26:01,106
<i>Hanbok</i> is so beautiful.
Of course, I'm more beautiful.

371
00:26:01,189 --> 00:26:04,025
Right. We have no time for this.
We have somewhere to go.

372
00:26:04,609 --> 00:26:05,652
Where?

373
00:26:05,735 --> 00:26:07,737
[♪ lively music playing]

374
00:26:16,413 --> 00:26:19,666
{\an8}Since the subjects are perfect,
the pictures came out amazing.

375
00:26:19,749 --> 00:26:21,835
{\an8}You're right. The photos are unique.

376
00:26:22,335 --> 00:26:25,297
This is what young people do
on dates these days.

377
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:28,383
Are we on a date, then?

378
00:26:28,466 --> 00:26:30,635
Here you go. Enjoy, Detective Han.

379
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:32,721
You, too. Enjoy.

380
00:26:34,598 --> 00:26:36,016
[vendor] Turkish ice cream.

381
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:37,893
Goodness. There's no cone!

382
00:26:37,976 --> 00:26:39,352
You have to grab it.

383
00:26:39,436 --> 00:26:40,437
-Can't do it?
-[Judge Kang] I can.

384
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,564
[vendor] You look like a fool.

385
00:26:42,647 --> 00:26:44,399
Can't do it, right? Thank you.

386
00:26:44,482 --> 00:26:45,859
Are you done already?

387
00:26:45,942 --> 00:26:47,736
Enjoy! Oops.

388
00:26:47,819 --> 00:26:49,321
-Give me ice cream!
-[vendor] Where is it?

389
00:26:49,404 --> 00:26:52,199
-Wait, Judge Kang. Stop.
-Give me ice cream!

390
00:26:52,282 --> 00:26:54,618
-Can you just...
-Sorry.

391
00:26:55,493 --> 00:26:57,162
[chuckles] It's ice cream.

392
00:26:57,245 --> 00:26:59,748
This reminds me of that man from earlier.

393
00:27:00,498 --> 00:27:04,002
"Can you get it? You can't, right?"

394
00:27:04,085 --> 00:27:05,837
"You look like a fool."

395
00:27:06,713 --> 00:27:09,299
I should've gotten his name.

[Judge Kang] <i>"The Petty Demon"?</i>

397
00:27:12,135 --> 00:27:14,304
Why does he think demons are petty?

398
00:27:14,387 --> 00:27:16,097
There are beautiful, strong,

399
00:27:16,181 --> 00:27:18,350
smart, and perfect demons like me, too.

400
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:19,643
[Daon] Yes.

401
00:27:19,726 --> 00:27:20,852
You're perfect.

402
00:27:20,936 --> 00:27:21,937
Right?

403
00:27:22,771 --> 00:27:24,064
I'm not petty.

404
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:25,941
How was today?

405
00:27:27,734 --> 00:27:28,902
I had fun.

406
00:27:30,028 --> 00:27:32,781
Though we mostly did
what you wanted to do.

407
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,452
[clears throat] Well, I must have fun
to make it fun for you too.

408
00:27:38,745 --> 00:27:39,746
You're right.

409
00:27:41,498 --> 00:27:43,875
So how do you feel?

410
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:51,132
Good. I loved it.

411
00:27:51,216 --> 00:27:52,217
Love...

412
00:27:52,884 --> 00:27:55,762
[chuckles] I wasn't asking about me.

413
00:27:55,846 --> 00:27:57,806
I know. I loved it and feel good.

414
00:28:00,308 --> 00:28:01,852
What did you think I meant?

415
00:28:02,561 --> 00:28:04,896
[scoffs] Nothing.

416
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,901
Thank you.

417
00:28:09,985 --> 00:28:11,069
For everything.

418
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:16,825
So pretty.

419
00:28:20,662 --> 00:28:22,706
That. The lighting is pretty.

They did a good job here.
The Stonewall Walkway.

421
00:28:28,378 --> 00:28:29,629
They did.

422
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,798
It's really pretty.

423
00:28:41,683 --> 00:28:42,684
Lord.

424
00:28:46,229 --> 00:28:50,066
My son's killer is back.

425
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:54,321
This time, he killed the officer
who was trying to protect me.

426
00:28:56,698 --> 00:29:00,827
Innocent people are dying.
Why aren't you doing anything, Lord?

427
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,335
You should've...

428
00:29:10,504 --> 00:29:12,172
had him kill me

429
00:29:13,298 --> 00:29:15,759
instead of that police officer.

430
00:29:16,801 --> 00:29:20,639
Then at least I could've
seen his face before I died.

431
00:29:22,057 --> 00:29:23,767
[yells] Don't you hear my prayers?

432
00:29:25,143 --> 00:29:27,896
I've prayed to you for 20 years.

433
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:30,106
How much longer must you test me?

434
00:29:32,234 --> 00:29:34,736
I'm not asking for much.

435
00:29:36,821 --> 00:29:39,407
I'm just asking that I see him once.

436
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:40,951
So why?

437
00:29:42,035 --> 00:29:43,745
[crying] Why?

438
00:29:44,371 --> 00:29:46,831
Why...

Why is it raining so much?

442
00:30:11,481 --> 00:30:12,899
Are you filming a music video?

443
00:30:12,983 --> 00:30:14,359
Why walk in the rain?

444
00:30:15,527 --> 00:30:16,862
Bitna.

00:30:17,612 --> 00:30:19,030

00:30:24,077 --> 00:30:25,829
[Judge Kang] That's hot! [yelps]

448
00:30:27,455 --> 00:30:30,166
Wake up! Hey!

00:30:42,846 --> 00:30:44,014
She's burning up.

450
00:30:50,353 --> 00:30:51,354
Are you awake?

451
00:30:51,938 --> 00:30:53,648
Why are you so heavy?

452
00:30:53,732 --> 00:30:55,400
I almost dislocated my shoulder.

453
00:30:57,903 --> 00:30:58,904
I'm sorry.

454
00:31:02,199 --> 00:31:03,783
[Judge Kang] Well,
the end justifies the means.

00:31:04,576 --> 00:31:06,203
I had to get your fever down.

456
00:31:09,206 --> 00:31:12,292
Just know I almost died
carrying that back.

457
00:31:12,375 --> 00:31:13,668
Thank you.

Did you find him? That man.

461
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,893
I've seen him before.

Why are you running away?
Did you kill my son? Did you?

I've only prayed
for one thing since that day.

473
00:32:36,293 --> 00:32:38,503
To let me see him one more time.

474
00:32:40,338 --> 00:32:42,966
So I can ask him why he killed my son.

475
00:32:49,389 --> 00:32:53,268
But He hasn't heard me. [sobbing]

476
00:33:01,151 --> 00:33:03,361
Since I'm a believer of God,

477
00:33:04,696 --> 00:33:08,158
I was going to forgive him
if he apologized.

478
00:33:08,867 --> 00:33:10,160
But I can't seem to.

479
00:33:11,536 --> 00:33:12,621
I want to...

480
00:33:13,622 --> 00:33:15,999
tear him limb from limb.

481
00:33:17,751 --> 00:33:19,252
[crying] I don't even know his face,

482
00:33:19,336 --> 00:33:22,589
but I've killed him in my mind
over and over again.

483
00:33:24,966 --> 00:33:27,677
But I'm still angry.

484
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,266
I'm frustrated and resentful. [sobbing]

485
00:33:38,605 --> 00:33:39,689
Honey.

486
00:33:40,357 --> 00:33:41,399
Honey.

487
00:33:41,483 --> 00:33:43,360
You told me last time...

488
00:33:45,445 --> 00:33:47,405
that you were tracking him down.

489
00:33:48,073 --> 00:33:50,992
You're a judge and you're very smart.

490
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,578
Please find him.

491
00:33:53,662 --> 00:33:54,829
I'm begging you.

492
00:33:55,622 --> 00:33:57,666
[crying] Please, find him.

493
00:33:58,750 --> 00:34:01,169
I'm begging you, please.

494
00:34:01,253 --> 00:34:02,671
Please find him.

495
00:34:02,754 --> 00:34:05,131
Please.

496
00:34:09,886 --> 00:34:11,596
Please. [sobbing]

497
00:34:12,848 --> 00:34:15,892
-Are you out of your mind? You'll die.
-I won't.

498
00:34:15,976 --> 00:34:18,478
What if you get caught by him
in that house?

499
00:34:18,562 --> 00:34:20,814
You don't have your powers anymore.

500
00:34:20,897 --> 00:34:22,566
Do you think you can beat Satan?

501
00:34:22,649 --> 00:34:24,276
I can slip out before he sees me.

502
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:25,443
Tyson said,

503
00:34:25,527 --> 00:34:29,114
"Everyone has a plan
until they get punched in the face."

504
00:34:29,197 --> 00:34:31,199
Daon must've cried alone like that, too.

505
00:34:32,117 --> 00:34:33,910
And all the other victims' families...

506
00:34:35,245 --> 00:34:36,955
probably cried their eyes out.

507
00:34:37,038 --> 00:34:39,249
How can I turn away from them?

508
00:34:39,332 --> 00:34:40,500
You can. Just do it.

509
00:34:40,584 --> 00:34:41,877
That's how you've been.

510
00:34:44,796 --> 00:34:47,090
I'm scared, too. So I hesitated.

511
00:34:48,508 --> 00:34:50,760
But if someone has to do it, I'll do it.

512
00:34:50,844 --> 00:34:52,179
But why?

513
00:34:52,262 --> 00:34:53,638
Because I'm a judge.

514
00:34:55,182 --> 00:34:56,433
[groans]

515
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,686
I'm telling Detective Han.

516
00:35:03,356 --> 00:35:04,941
Why aren't you stopping me?

517
00:35:05,025 --> 00:35:06,526
Because you're on my side.

518
00:35:07,319 --> 00:35:08,320
So creepy.

519
00:35:08,403 --> 00:35:11,823
Make sure Arong doesn't get near Daon
while I'm gone.

520
00:35:11,907 --> 00:35:14,826
Arong's been gone for a while now.
Don't worry.

521
00:35:14,910 --> 00:35:16,203
When...

522
00:35:17,037 --> 00:35:18,205
When will you go?

523
00:35:20,582 --> 00:35:21,583
Soon.

524
00:35:31,718 --> 00:35:32,886
Thank you, Assemblyman.

525
00:35:33,386 --> 00:35:35,555
There's no need for that, Mr. Jeong.

526
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:37,182
Don't worry about the business.

527
00:35:37,766 --> 00:35:38,892
Okay.

528
00:35:42,312 --> 00:35:43,688
[caddie] Nice shot!

530
00:35:46,233 --> 00:35:48,818
You should retire
and start golfing professionally.

531
00:35:48,902 --> 00:35:50,779
Gosh, you flatter me.

532
00:35:50,862 --> 00:35:52,572
-Perhaps a little too much.
-[all laughing]

533
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,575
-[Jaegeol] Thank you.
-[assemblyman] Of course.

534
00:35:56,826 --> 00:35:59,246
-What time is Judge Kang coming?
-At seven.

535
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,499
We still have time. Let's enjoy our round.

536
00:36:02,582 --> 00:36:03,708
[Taegyu] All right.

537
00:36:11,508 --> 00:36:15,554
I was expecting you for dinner
at 7 p.m. You're early.

538
00:36:15,637 --> 00:36:17,097
I've got too much time.

539
00:36:17,889 --> 00:36:19,641
Is no one home?

540
00:36:19,724 --> 00:36:21,476
His younger son is on the second floor.

541
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,937
Seonho's home now?

542
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,439
He probably took some sleeping pills
and is asleep.

543
00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:28,316
I see.

544
00:36:29,901 --> 00:36:33,864
Do you know
that big department store in Yeouido?

545
00:36:33,947 --> 00:36:36,575
Could you get some egg tarts from there?

546
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,201
I'm sorry.

547
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,412
I'm afraid it's too far.

548
00:36:40,495 --> 00:36:42,622
And it's just me here, so I can't leave.

549
00:36:43,206 --> 00:36:45,000
I'm soon to be married into this family.

550
00:36:46,918 --> 00:36:48,086
[chuckles nervously]

551
00:36:51,173 --> 00:36:52,174

MY ICON AND ROLE MODEL

568
00:43:16,975 --> 00:43:19,978
[Donghun] As I thought,
this junkie attacked Kang Bitna.

569
00:43:20,061 --> 00:43:24,191
The night Kang Bitna was attacked,
he took a taxi near the park.

570
00:43:24,274 --> 00:43:26,568
This was highly suspicious,

571
00:43:26,651 --> 00:43:28,737
but the investigation
was closed because...

572
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:29,821
Someone told them to.

573
00:43:29,905 --> 00:43:33,783
Then Jeong Jaegeol or Jeong Taegyu,
which one could it be?

574
00:43:33,867 --> 00:43:35,118
[Hongcheol] It must be Jeong Jaegeol.

575
00:43:37,704 --> 00:43:38,914
What are you doing?

576
00:43:38,997 --> 00:43:42,500
We weren't trying to hide this from you.

577
00:43:42,584 --> 00:43:44,127
We had to be sure before...

578
00:43:44,211 --> 00:43:46,171
You should eat properly to work late.

579

You're a tough one.

You're just weak.

592
00:44:33,051 --> 00:44:36,596
Seeing how fiesty you are,
I didn't get you right the first time.

You should have just died then.

Why are you doing this to me?

602
00:45:28,982 --> 00:45:30,817
Because you keep butting in.

603

Don't try stalling with that nonsense.

No matter how hard
you try to get out of here,

608

you won't make it out alive.
