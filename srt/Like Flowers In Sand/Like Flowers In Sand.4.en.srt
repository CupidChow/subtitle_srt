1
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,962
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

2
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,429
Kim Baek-du, did you find it?
Come on and bring it here.

3
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,847
Okay.

4
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,185
Come on.

5
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:02,896
Hurry!

6
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,731
FIRST GEUMGANG-CLASS CHAMPIONSHIP

7
00:01:21,414 --> 00:01:22,916
24-HOUR SCENE

8
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:25,085
Hey, it's starting now.

9
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,419
We received reports

10
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:29,589
of rampant pickpocketing
around the subway station

11
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:33,468
and went to investigate
in hopes of gathering information.

12
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:35,136
Most pickpockets' eyes

13
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,930
are fixed on people's belongings

14
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,474
such as handbags, rather than people.

15
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:42,310
KIM GEUM-GANG
FIRST GEUMGANG-CLASS CHAMPIONSHIP

16
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:49,317
EPISODE 4
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID THAT DAY

17
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:53,947
I didn't say anything wrong.

18
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,491
I can say that much because she's married.

19
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:02,205
And why is she still so violent? Jeez.

20
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,165
Darn it.

21
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:08,253
And she's been lying to me,
saying that she wasn't Du-sik.

22
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:09,254
What about that?

23
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,852
Why are you so surprised?
As if you didn't know.

24
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:25,687
Hey.

25
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,273
-Oh Du-sik, you…
-Baek-du.

26
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,860
No matter how hard you try,
I can see right through you.

27
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:36,531
So stop saying you hate ssireum.
You don't even mean it.

28
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,242
Come back while I ask nicely.

29
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,911
Du-sik, look.

30
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:44,414
-Why are you doing this to me--
-Because I need you.

31
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,501
Both the team and I need you.

32
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,087
We need you, Baek-du.

33
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:56,926
I…

34
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,096
really need you to be here.

35
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,900
Well, but…

36
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,945
Is this okay?

37
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,030
What do you mean?

38
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,365
I mean, you…

39
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:21,951
You're married.

40
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:23,912
And?

41
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:28,291
Well, since you're married now

42
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,084
and have a husband,

43
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:33,463
maybe you're not supposed to say

44
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,174
things like that to me.

45
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:37,926
Okay. Keep going.

46
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,929
Don't put me in a bind.

47
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:46,935
Wait, what are you thinking?

48
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,520
Me and you?

49
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:53,733
Kim Baek-du!

50
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,151
Have you lost your mind?

51
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,320
-That hurts.
-Stay away from me.

52
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,155
-Or I'll kill you.
-Wait, Du-sik.

53
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,990
If you come near me, I'll throw you.

54
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,116
-Wait.
-Got it?

55
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,993
-Hey.
-You must be crazy.

56
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,411
-Wait.
-I can't believe this.

57
00:04:05,495 --> 00:04:08,706
Wait a moment. You…

58
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,334
-What's the matter?
-Be quiet.

59
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,377
Why?

60
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,420
What is it? Du-sik!

61
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:25,098
If that's not what it is,
why would she need me?

62
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:28,518
And why would she look at me like that?

63
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,729
Kim Baek-du must have
completely lost his mind.

64
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,692
I mean, what does he take me for?

65
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:40,738
That is the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard in my life.

66
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,825
Seriously.

67
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,744
That was insulting.

68
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,706
And absolutely humiliating.

69
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,419
What?

70
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,007
Honey.

71
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,094
Could you please stop calling me "honey"?

72
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,387
Ms. Chu.

73
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:08,766
-What does that mean?
-Ms. Chu is here.

74
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,789
Too late to put on a show.

75
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,000
I heard you arguing out there.

76
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,669
Is this really your best?

77
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:40,214
Captain, what are you doing here?

78
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:41,174
Why?

79
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,677
-I'm not allowed to come here?
-That's not it.

80
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:48,431
This tastes bad.

81
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:55,146
On the day Choi died,
he had a fight with someone.

82
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,606
A CCTV here caught it.

83
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,242
Mom, did you hear?

84
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,162
The new general manager
of the ssireum team recommended

85
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:13,581
Baek-du as the new coach.

86
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:33,267
CONGRATULATIONS ON RETIREMENT

87
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,326
What's there to hesitate about?

88
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:52,745
This is a rare opportunity, you know.

89
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,831
But it's kind of awkward.

90
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:58,543
What's so awkward?
Just suck it up and do it.

91
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,169
Jin-su…

92
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,714
I'm putting him
in a somewhat awkward position now.

93
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:07,051
He even turned down
the other coaching position to come here.

94
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,846
Goodness, our baby brother has
such a kind heart,

95
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,807
worrying about four-time champion Jin-su.

96
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,393
You're definitely going to heaven.

97
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,271
Seriously, you better worry
about yourself.

98
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,648
Did you see Jin-su's car?

99
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:23,109
His car costs more than your salary.

100
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,152
Who are you to talk?

101
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:27,363
It's not just about Jin-su.

102
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,241
How can I be a coach
when I've never won a championship?

103
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,994
I told you. It doesn't matter.

104
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,829
God, you're so frustrating.

105
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,542
Look.

106
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:43,504
Father won numerous championships,

107
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,341
but he's horrible at teaching.

108
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:51,512
The ability to convey information
and help others understand.

109
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,891
Hey, what's it called?
Making others understand things.

110
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,893
Teaching. Father can't teach.

111
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,812
Right. Teaching. Teacher.

112
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,856
-"Ching"?
-Yes, that.

113
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:05,693
Anyhow, just act cool and accept the job.

114
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,445
This is a great chance!

115
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,405
Gosh, enough already.

116
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:13,701
Stop trying to convince me.
I made up my mind. Just stop it.

117
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:16,329
You're going to freeze and starve!

118
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,580
Hey!

119
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,917
Jeez, what do I do
with that clueless punk?

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,084
Just leave him alone.

121
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,129
If it doesn't work out,
I can start livestreaming with him.

122
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:30,426
How strange.

123
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,012
Where did it go?

124
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,056
Everything else is here except that one.

125
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,308
What are you looking for?

126
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:41,354
You know the tape from when you won
the championship for the first time?

127
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,564
-I want to review that.
-Okay.

128
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,859
But that's the only tape that's missing.

129
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,862
-Did you take it?
-No, I don't know where it is.

130
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,739
Baek-du!

131
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,742
How strange.

132
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,206
There's one thing
I don't quite understand.

133
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:06,295
Why did Choi Chil-seong come out
to the boondocks with an APB out on him?

134
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:10,841
If I were him, I would've fled overseas
with the money and lay low.

135
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:14,637
Old habits die hard. He was probably
trying to score some cash here.

136
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,182
From a ssireum game in the boonies?
After all the big games?

137
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,768
He would've been too proud for that.

138
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:24,730
And besides, Choi Chil-seong is dead now.

139
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,983
-So--
-Then go.

140
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,026
I didn't ask you to follow me here.

141
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,861
You think I wanted to come here?

142
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,989
I'm here because Captain told me to come.

143
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,075
What a loving family.

144
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,995
Hey.

145
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:43,374
How long do you think
you can hold out here like this?

146
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,960
Just pack up then.

147
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:48,796
And come with me
when I head back to Seoul later.

148
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:54,093
So what's your point?

149
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,803
What do you want to do?

150
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:58,222
I don't think it's too late

151
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:00,099
-to publicize the investigation--
-No.

152
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,937
Because we need to find out
why Choi came to Geosan, whom he met,

153
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,439
and who killed him.

154
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:11,485
Yu-gyeong, are you sure about this?

155
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:14,030
You're certain you can uncover all that?

156
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,283
Yes.

157
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,621
Is that so?

158
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,789
-Then give it a go.
-Captain.

159
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,250
You can't stay undercover for long anyway.

160
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:30,087
So either find Choi's ledger
or the murder suspect as soon as possible.

161
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,172
Understood?

162
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:38,596
This is all because of Oh Du-sik.

163
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,349
Now, I'm in a pickle.

164
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,852
She's definitely trying to screw me over.

165
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:48,439
She must've had all this planned out and…

166
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,034
That lady…

167
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:08,084
The smoke ring?

168
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,257
But what's she doing here?

169
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,510
He actually made a fair point.

170
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,471
If you don't find anything soon,
I'll call you back.

171
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,555
Okay.

172
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:26,894
And you, keep an eye on her.
If she loses it again, call me right away.

173
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,396
Yes, ma'am.

174
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,272
You guys.

175
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,275
You're not arguing every day, are you?

176
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:34,527
-No, ma'am.
-No, ma'am.

177
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:38,072
You better behave.
I'll be keeping an eye on you.

178
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:44,787
You guys make me so worried.

179
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,795
Don't follow me.
You'll only give me a headache.

180
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,297
-Yes, ma'am.
-Have a safe trip back.

181
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,298
Go now.

182
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,352
You fool.

183
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,813
Why do you let her
walk all over you like that?

184
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,319
Can you believe it?

185
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,363
This is just ridiculous!

186
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,408
Now, my boy Jin-su has nowhere to go.

187
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,660
This is a funny situation indeed.

188
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,204
But Jin-su shouldn't have come

189
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,957
just after that one talk
with Head Coach Park.

190
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,543
-He should've signed the contract--
-What?

191
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,921
Hey, look.

192
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:38,924
How would he have known
things would turn out this way?

193
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:43,554
He came
because Head Coach Park begged him to.

194
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:47,683
Jin-su didn't do anything wrong,
except for being tender-hearted!

195
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,768
I didn't say he did something wrong.

196
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:52,354
I'm just saying,
if Jin-su can't be the coach--

197
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,734
Why can't he? Why?

198
00:12:56,817 --> 00:13:00,988
He's obviously better than Baek-du
in every aspect! So why?

199
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:02,364
Why would you say that?

200
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,492
That's why I said, "if."

201
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:07,703
Jeez, just forget it.
Now I'm too scared to say anything.

202
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,830
Why Baek-du, of all people?

203
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,042
I'm not eating this.

204
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,503
-Sit down!
-Fine. Darn it.

205
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,717
-Hello.
-Hey.

206
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,721
What a weird situation, right?

207
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,974
Shall we talk inside? Come in.

208
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,559
Let's go.

209
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,065
Our manager didn't say anything before.

210
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,026
Then suddenly, yesterday,
Baek-du's name came up.

211
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,904
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

212
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,950
Gosh. Why couldn't it have come up sooner?

213
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,868
Before I called you here.

214
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,578
A new general manager?

215
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,455
What? Yes.

216
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,791
A new manager, recently hired
by the governor.

217
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,125
The governor?

218
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,253
Were they recruited from some other team?

219
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:01,257
No idea.
Maybe somebody asked him for a favor.

220
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,886
But the manager seemed
to be quite good at ssireum.

221
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:10,015
On the first day,
one of the boys got on her nerves,

222
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:12,017
and she threw him right over.

223
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,562
What? What's the manager's name?

224
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:16,855
Yu-gyeong. Oh Yu-gyeong.

225
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,358
-So a woman?
-Yeah.

226
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:23,237
The governor requested multiple times

227
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,739
that we cooperate with her.

228
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,741
So I can't just disregard her opinion.

229
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,998
I'll see if I can convince the manager.

230
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,959
Just give me a few days, okay?

231
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,363
Don't say "hi-yah." They know what it is.

232
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:11,327
Your form is a bit…

233
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,579
Sorry?

234
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:17,041
When you use that technique,
you shouldn't pull the satba down.

235
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,627
Leaning backwards
will make it easier to throw him.

236
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,879
Well… Actually,

237
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:26,550
Baek-du told me
to do it this way the other day.

238
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,931
Should I try again?

239
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,851
No. Whatever is more comfortable for you.

240
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,770
Keep it up.

241
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,025
Hey.

242
00:15:43,984 --> 00:15:46,528
The top student says
the answer is number three

243
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,115
and a so-so one says it's number five,
and you're picking number five?

244
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,284
Use your brain, will you?

245
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,661
Stop. That's enough.

246
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,372
-Let's get back to practice.
-Come on.

247
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,718
Hello.

248
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,015
A new general manager?

249
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:18,435
Yes. A new manager,
recently hired by the governor.

250
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,371
Jeez.

251
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:41,959
That punk has such creepy eyes.

252
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:52,386
KIM BAEK-DU

253
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,054
Come to our spot after work.

254
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,764
What is this now?

255
00:16:58,726 --> 00:16:59,643
Wow.

256
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,313
Was this place always this small?

257
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,232
From what I remember, I had to run

258
00:17:05,315 --> 00:17:07,568
for quite a while to get there
from this end.

259
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,902
What are you saying?

260
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:12,406
Even back then, you could run
from here to there in no time.

261
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,824
Will you be quiet?

262
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:16,160
I'm having a moment here.

263
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,457
Does that taste good, by the way?

264
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,374
This?

265
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,003
-Would you like a sip?
-No, I can't drink.

266
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:28,672
You can't drink? Why?

267
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,340
Are you sick?

268
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:33,093
Sick? No way! I'm very healthy.

269
00:17:33,177 --> 00:17:35,012
And energetic.

270
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:38,974
I think my body just can't take alcohol.

271
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:42,728
Whenever I drink,
I can't remember anything later.

272
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,191
Jeez. Can you be more pathetic?

273
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,030
What? What is it?

274
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,574
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

275
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:56,492
No reason.

276
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:01,371
You really have a knack
of getting on my nerves.

277
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,414
Do you know that?

278
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,916
Be careful.

279
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:06,919
That's not it.

280
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:09,296
I saw it.

281
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,801
I saw everything earlier.

282
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,094
Saw what?

283
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:20,182
You being scolded by some lady
in front of your house.

284
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,687
Hey.

285
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,023
Is she who I'm thinking?

286
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,566
Is she?

287
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,195
What do you mean?

288
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,073
She's your mother-in-law.

289
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,037
By the way, she looked familiar.

290
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,624
I think I've seen her on a TV show.

291
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,003
-What TV show?
-You know…

292
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,463
The…

293
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,260
Right. Love and War.

294
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:58,303
That's right. Love and War.

295
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:02,182
Oh, I see.

296
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,017
From what I saw earlier,

297
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,604
she didn't seem any different
from the ladies on that show.

298
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:09,398
You think?

299
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,864
Does she nag you a lot?

300
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,742
Basically every time she sees me.

301
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:24,830
What does your husband do?
He was just staying in the back earlier.

302
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:25,831
Oh, him.

303
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:29,209
He doesn't know anything.
He's still too young.

304
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,961
He's young? How old is he?

305
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,839
He must be 32.

306
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,716
No, he's 33.

307
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,926
That's not young. He's all grown up.

308
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,888
What kind of husband does that?

309
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:46,393
What's with you? Why do you look so upset?

310
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:50,647
Sometimes, I talk back to her
pretty strongly too. You know my temper.

311
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:52,191
But still.

312
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,324
You should've been careful
before marrying him.

313
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:13,170
It's not that bad.
You don't have to worry about it.

314
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,427
About what you said to me the other day…

315
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:22,763
What?

316
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,432
You told me to go back
to the ssireum team.

317
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,226
Right.

318
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,020
About that,

319
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,981
I'll think about it carefully.

320
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:56,255
It's not like Jin-su won
the championships by Ghost Leg.

321
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,757
He won them because he was so good.

322
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,300
So he should be the coach.

323
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,260
-Right.
-Makes sense.

324
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:02,928
I get your point,

325
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:05,639
but being good at something

326
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,058
doesn't mean
that you're good at teaching it.

327
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:13,188
I mean, take my daughter's tutor,
for example.

328
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,149
She went to the best university,
but was worthless at teaching.

329
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,152
"Why can't you understand this?"

330
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,863
"Why doesn't she understand this, ma'am?"

331
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:24,324
Come on. Jin-su won't be like that.

332
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:26,118
-Right.
-Well, I don't think

333
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,578
Jin-su gets along very well
with his juniors.

334
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,497
But these boys love Baek-du.

335
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,166
-Right.
-But Jin-su is just so cold.

336
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,585
It's not some social gathering, you know.

337
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,879
A coach must have good ssireum skills.

338
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,172
But…

339
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:42,592
-Baek-du isn't that bad at ssireum either.
-That's right.

340
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:46,722
He just never got to show
all the skills he has.

341
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,391
Come on. That means he's just bad at it.

342
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,517
He's just bad.

343
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,893
Wait. Keep it down.

344
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:53,812
What's up?

345
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,950
-Hey.
-What?

346
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:08,994
-Oh, no.
-This is bad.

347
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,954
Oh, no. What do we do?

348
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:12,664
Oh, dear.

349
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:29,806
We must choose, one way or another.
We can't live like this forever.

350
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,393
Jin-su's mom won't even give you
extra side dishes

351
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,811
if you say you support Baek-du.

352
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,146
And at the health center,

353
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:39,816
they give you free medicine
if you support Baek-du.

354
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,234
I actually like that.

355
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:44,905
Still, we can't keep switching sides
whenever we visit different stores.

356
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:47,115
It gives me headaches.

357
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,826
Where are we going, by the way?

358
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,704
We're going to match up
Jin-su and Baek-du.

359
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,456
The winner will be the coach.

360
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,041
That's a great idea.

361
00:22:56,124 --> 00:23:00,128
Oh, boy. It looks like
they've already started a fight.

362
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:07,594
You know, about that…

363
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,971
About the coaching position.

364
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,516
Did Seongwon find a replacement already?

365
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,518
-Why do you ask?
-Well…

366
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:16,937
-Because you--
-You want me to be Seongwon's coach

367
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,105
so you can take this?

368
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,774
Come on, Jin-su. Don't be like that.

369
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:24,111
You see, I'm not interested
in the coaching position at all.

370
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:26,863
I'm really not. But…

371
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,199
But I have a reason now to…

372
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,200
No.

373
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:33,954
I'm going to be the coach here,
no matter what.

374
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:36,206
Of course. Jin-su, you should do it.

375
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:39,584
Fine. You have it all then.

376
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:43,880
What… Why?

377
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,261
-Let's have a match!
-A match?

378
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:51,388
What?

379
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:55,767
You and I will have a match
to decide who should be the coach.

380
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,728
What, aren't you confident you'll win?

381
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,730
If you're not,

382
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,315
I'll take it as a defeat.

383
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,070
What do you say? Are you up for a match?

384
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:09,072
-Go for it.
-Come on.

385
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,908
How can I… Forget it.

386
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,787
Oh, come on.

387
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,290
What's your answer?

388
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:20,750
I'm not sure.

389
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:37,142
I'm not sure

390
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,226
if you can beat me.

391
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,395
-What?
-Fine.

392
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:42,397
Let's have a match.

393
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,150
We won't know who will win
until we wrestle, will we?

394
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,360
Gosh, I'm excited!

395
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,197
It's been ages since we had a match!

396
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,617
Am I right? This will be so much fun!

397
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,535
All right. We'll have a match!

398
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,385
-Are you crazy?
-Come on!

399
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,180
Settle your tabs, will you?

400
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,806
It's not even much!

401
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,818
You know what? There's a thin line
between bravery and recklessness.

402
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:32,113
But in your case, you're so far gone.
You're reckless.

403
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:34,616
Want a bite?

404
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:37,953
What's wrong with you?

405
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,166
Why did you accept it?

406
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,626
Do you want to be a coach?

407
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,961
No way.

408
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,880
I've never even dreamed of it.

409
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,675
Then, why?
Why did you suddenly decide to do it?

410
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:54,261
Obviously, I wasn't thinking.

411
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,346
I must've been possessed by something.

412
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,683
Possessed by what?

413
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,739
You don't want to know.
It's some evil girl.

414
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,616
What are you saying?

415
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:23,373
You don't have to worry too much, though.

416
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:25,834
I feel bad saying this,

417
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:28,545
but not many people
actually expect you to win.

418
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:29,838
Almost none.

419
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,548
So don't worry.

420
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,590
What about you?

421
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,051
Do you think I'll lose?

422
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,142
And you call yourself a friend?

423
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:53,945
Darn it.

424
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,615
It's impossible to identify that person.

425
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:02,537
Should we ask Geosan Precinct for help?
They might be able to recognize him.

426
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,791
Hey, I'm here.

427
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,418
Come on. Hurry up.

428
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,711
-Let's go.
-Hey.

429
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,881
-Where's Uk?
-He left way earlier.

430
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,094
LEFT TO WATCH SSIREUM
PAY HONESTLY

431
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:28,521
Hey. Come this way.

432
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,399
Hey! I'm here.

433
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:34,778
-You made it.
-Hey.

434
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:36,488
Why are you so late?

435
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,781
Where were you?

436
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,452
This is amazing. I think we have
more of an audience than usual.

437
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,079
It wasn't like this at my match.

438
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:53,296
Other people might think
there's some great match here.

439
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,382
What's the matter?

440
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,134
Can you believe
those guys are sitting there?

441
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,135
You're right.

442
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:02,138
Do they actually think
that Baek-du will win?

443
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,349
Well, we all have different opinions, so…

444
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,144
-He has poor judgment.
-He was called a prodigy.

445
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,646
Right.

446
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,607
Baek-du sure was born with talent.

447
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:16,277
-Drink some water.
-I'm good.

448
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,613
I have everything here.

449
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,281
Look at Jin-su's body.

450
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,534
He looks so sturdy.

451
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,702
The guys in Seongwon told me

452
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:28,123
that he's been lifting weights
two hours a day since retirement.

453
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:30,125
-You're kidding.
-It's true.

454
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:32,794
No smoking, no alcohol.
He's been textbook clean.

455
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,632
He's so fit.

456
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,092
Does Baek-du have a chance?

457
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:42,804
Why not? He's got a great body.

458
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:46,182
I heard he was born with a body
that easily builds muscle.

459
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,601
Right. I also heard from someone

460
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:52,647
that Jin-su joined Seongwon in high school
because of Baek-du.

461
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,773
Why?

462
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,735
Because he had never beaten Baek-du
until middle school.

463
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,654
You got this, Jin-su!

464
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,198
You got this!

465
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,702
Let's go! My son is the best!

466
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,203
GEOSAN-GUN SSIREUM TEAM

467
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:10,206
Hold his satba tight
and don't even think of lifting him.

468
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,375
It will be hard because he's heavier.

469
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:17,005
Just let him try Lifting Throw
and trip him up so he'll lose balance.

470
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,506
-Okay.
-Sounds great.

471
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,884
-Are you listening to me?
-Yes. Okay.

472
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,136
-Did you really hear what I said?
-Yes. Jeez.

473
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,554
You look so distracted.

474
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:25,847
Listen to your brother.

475
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,641
Your only problem is
that you hold the satba too loosely.

476
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:32,145
Do you know what a satba is in ssireum?
It's the heart of ssireum.

477
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:34,063
Toughen up, okay?

478
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,567
Having a soft heart can be…
What's the word?

479
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:41,404
Strength. It can be your strength,
but this is a match. This world is cruel.

480
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,117
All right. Baek-du, Jin-su, come on up.

481
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,536
Okay? Just keep what I said in mind.

482
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,789
-Go, Baek-du!
-Go, Jin-su!

483
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:52,248
Let's go, Jin-su!

484
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,263
Baek-du, you can do it!

485
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:12,769
Geosan's champion, Kwak Jin-su!

486
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:14,646
Let's go!

487
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,399
Grab satbas.

488
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,407
Jeez. That's a tight grip.

489
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,993
Left knees up.

490
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,246
The grip seems disadvantageous
for Baek-du.

491
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:36,251
Outer leg! It's an outer leg skill!

492
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,878
Baek-du! Jin-su is going to do
an outer leg skill!

493
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,797
He'll go for his outer leg.

494
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:43,842
Jin-su!

495
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,927
-Hey.
-Look at that.

496
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:52,851
-Oh, come on!
-Jin-su's leg gave out.

497
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,652
Just throw that little brat!

498
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,450
-Go, Jin-su!
-Go, Jin-su!

499
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,914
Please…

500
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,584
-What?
-Nothing.

501
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,711
He's falling a bit short.

502
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,091
Nice!

503
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:29,387
That's my son! You rock!

504
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,184
That's my boy!

505
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:37,270
What was that just now?

506
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:40,315
Jin-su must be quite surprised.

507
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,360
Kwak Jin-su for the win!

508
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,114
Oh, no. Baek-du.

509
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,118
Good job, Baek-du.

510
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,954
-Was that a good job?
-Of course it was.

511
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:58,583
Given their weight difference,
he did an incredible job.

512
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:02,003
You would've won if you'd grabbed
the satba more tightly, you fool.

513
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:05,673
Kim Baek-du has delivered a performance
far beyond our expectations.

514
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:09,010
I was going to turn off the camera,
but I'll keep it on for now.

515
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,096
Relax and focus. Okay?

516
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,473
Now, come on up, boys.

517
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,642
Listen to Geum-gang. Get the head start.

518
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:16,726
Keep it smooth.

519
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:18,144
Grab the satba tight.

520
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,772
Go, Baek-du!

521
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,814
You got this!

522
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,524
-Let's go!
-Let's turn this around!

523
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:25,068
Let's go!

524
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,368
Baek-du!

525
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:39,457
Let's win this
and go eat at my restaurant.

526
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,708
Grab the leg satbas.

527
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,004
Baek-du, satba!

528
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,927
Baek-du, pull your shoulders in.

529
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,596
-Shoulders.
-Grab the waist satbas.

530
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,516
-Nice.
-Jin-su!

531
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,684
Nice satba grip.

532
00:32:57,767 --> 00:32:59,352
-Left knees up!
-Nice shoulders.

533
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,020
Stand up.

534
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:05,274
Let's go.

535
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,387
Hold out with your core! Nice!

536
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,988
That was amazing.

537
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:55,700
Why are you showing your skills
at an unofficial match after retirement?

538
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:58,119
Right, Father? Father, are you crying?

539
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,080
-Honey.
-Yes?

540
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,498
Who do you think will win?

541
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:05,334
I'm not sure. They seem evenly matched.

542
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,045
Do you need water?

543
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:12,216
Jeez, what's gotten into Baek-du?

544
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,217
Tell me about it.

545
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:16,929
Jin-su seems to be in pretty good shape.

546
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,057
-See? You can do it.
-What's going on?

547
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,309
Grab the satba properly. Okay?

548
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,686
Yu-gyeong, who do you think will win?

549
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,689
I'm not sure.

550
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:30,151
Come on. Then, who do you wish would win?

551
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,404
-Keep it in.
-Very good.

552
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,364
Stay strong, okay?

553
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,575
It's called
Outer Leg Back Satba Snatching.

554
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,285
It's a hard combination skill.

555
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:42,538
-I can't believe you used that.
-Now, it's the last round.

556
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,916
-Getting the hang of it?
-Come on up now.

557
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,793
-All right.
-Keep the momentum.

558
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,336
Let's go for it once again!

559
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,129
Let's go!

560
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,341
You can do it.

561
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:58,304
Go, Jin-su! You got this, my boy!

562
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,014
Make some noise!

563
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,770
My gosh,
I think my heart is going to explode.

564
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,820
I told him not to skip breakfast.

565
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,530
-Left knees up.
-Now he's getting tired.

566
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,782
You got this!

567
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,618
Do it properly. Let's start over.

568
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,873
Good luck!

569
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,344
Mr. Kim Baek-du!

570
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:42,640
What?

571
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,308
What's happening?

572
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:45,935
Yes?

573
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,938
Could we talk for a moment?

574
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,441
Come over here.

575
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,569
-They're in the middle of a match.
-Here.

576
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,529
Oh, you're a police officer.

577
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:58,156
Yes. Please come this way.

578
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,825
What are the cops doing here?

579
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,411
We need to check a few things with you

580
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:06,706
regarding the fatal accident
that happened here recently.

581
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,417
Please follow us to the police station.

582
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,419
-The fatal accident?
-Yes.

583
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,045
What are they doing here?

584
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,422
What are you going to do?

585
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:15,965
Just stay here.

586
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,302
Why would you take my boy?

587
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,263
-Explain what this is about.
-Come on, don't be like this.

588
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:24,932
If you keep doing this,
we'll have to arrest you

589
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,601
for obstruction of justice.

590
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,769
So please step aside for now.

591
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,855
Did you bring a warrant?

592
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,273
This is ridiculous.

593
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,358
It's not what you think it is.

594
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,735
It won't take long.

595
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,820
We just need to check a few things.

596
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,447
-This isn't obstruction.
-Let's go.

597
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,365
-No.
-Please come here.

598
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,783
-Hey.
-No, wait.

599
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:45,620
Wait. Do I…

600
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,624
Do I go like this?

601
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,854
What on earth did Baek-du do wrong?

602
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,565
They said it isn't because
he did something wrong.

603
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:17,235
They just wanted to check something.

604
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:19,237
Then they would've checked it there,

605
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,447
instead of taking him
to the police station.

606
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:25,284
It's not a big deal.

607
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:28,788
You know there was
an accident here recently, right?

608
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:32,959
Apparently, the dead guy
and Baek-du ran into each other,

609
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,378
and it was captured
on the CCTV by the coast.

610
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,629
-By the coast?
-Yes.

611
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,673
See, Sarge? I told you there must be--

612
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:40,132
They're just asking him

613
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:43,344
a few questions about that,
so don't worry about it.

614
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,054
They say it's not a big deal.

615
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,182
Man.

616
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,060
Maybe we should get him a lawyer.

617
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:54,063
Do any of you know a lawyer?

618
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:59,527
Come on. The only people anyone here knows
are ssireum wrestlers.

619
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,196
To us, lawyers are like

620
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,282
-unicorns in fairy tales…
-Right.

621
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,742
Wait. That reminds me.

622
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,369
My cousin's sister-in-law.

623
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:09,704
-She's a lawyer.
-Wait!

624
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,998
About that day, he won't be of any help.

625
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,124
What are you saying?

626
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,583
Why? What is it?

627
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,002
What's wrong with him?

628
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:20,381
That day, Baek-du was drunk.

629
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:21,799
Mr. Kim Baek-du.

630
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,677
You know

631
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:27,763
that someone died recently

632
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:30,182
in your neighborhood, right?

633
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:32,143
Yes, I heard about it.

634
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,812
And according to our investigation,

635
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:40,192
you were the last person
to see Choi Chil-seong on that day.

636
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,527
That's why you're here.

637
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,737
I was?

638
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,447
Yes.

639
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:48,075
Around 10:00 p.m. that night, you walked
along Geosan Coastal Road, right?

640
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,787
We verified that from the CCTV footage.

641
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,539
Mr. Kim.

642
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,334
Depending on what you say now,

643
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,294
you can be in serious trouble.

644
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,212
So,

645
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:05,509
please tell me everything you remember
about what happened that day.

646
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,643
I don't remember.

647
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:15,978
What?

648
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:19,315
But it happened only recently.

649
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,192
No, Detective.

650
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:24,737
That day, I drank so much and…

651
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,656
How much did you drink?

652
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,785
This much soju in a beer glass.

653
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,536
Come on.

654
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,122
That's not enough to have a blackout.

655
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,957
To me, that's a fatal dose.

656
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:41,128
Then, do you have any foggy memories
that you recall?

657
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,464
Gosh, I really don't remember anything.

658
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:45,716
Give me a minute.

659
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,010
That day,

660
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,804
I drank alcohol,

661
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,973
and my friends yelled at me.

662
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:56,102
When I woke up,
I was startled by my mom's face.

663
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,937
Then, the bruise on my waist.

664
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,815
-And…
-A bruise?

665
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,734
Yes. I don't know how I got it,

666
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,278
but I had a small injury here.
Let me just…

667
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,739
Could you have had a fight?

668
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,157
A fight?

669
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:14,161
Actually, we went over
the CCTV footage thoroughly

670
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:18,707
and saw that you and Choi Chil-seong

671
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,252
had a scuffle on the road that night.

672
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,006
Why did you fight him?

673
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,770
I guess not yet.

674
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,815
What's taking so long?

675
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,733
Stop shaking your leg.

676
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,153
Captain Chu said she'd take care of it.

677
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:50,406
They'll come out once they're done.

678
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:55,035
What if he gets scared
and says something stupid?

679
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,289
Yu-gyeong.

680
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:02,001
I've been wondering this for a while.

681
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:03,794
Do you--

682
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:05,963
That's…

683
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,675
What's she doing here?

684
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,015
It looks like

685
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:19,018
Kim Baek-du really
doesn't remember anything.

686
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:20,102
What do we do?

687
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:22,980
Hey, Chu Mi-suk.

688
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,149
You must have a lot of free time.

689
00:41:25,649 --> 00:41:27,276
Is there nothing to do in Seoul?

690
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,655
Why did you all have to come down here
at the same time?

691
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:34,617
So tell me. Who is he?

692
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:37,620
We identified that man for you,

693
00:41:37,703 --> 00:41:40,456
so shouldn't you at least tell us
what's going on?

694
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:45,878
He's a suspect in the murder
of Choi Chil-seong,

695
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,922
whom we've chased for years.

696
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,215
Choi Chil-seong?

697
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,009
Choi Chil-seong…

698
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:53,928
The name sounds familiar.

699
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,513
He's a match-fixer who set up

700
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,807
a gambling scheme worth
billions of won, involving politicians.

701
00:41:58,891 --> 00:41:59,767
What?

702
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,353
It's a confidential investigation,

703
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,939
so I couldn't give you a heads-up.
I apologize.

704
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,566
And that man is the suspect?

705
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:11,570
Salute.

706
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,698
What the…

707
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,951
We're in the middle of an interrogation.

708
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,619
Well, it's just that…

709
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,205
There's someone
insisting she has something to say.

710
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:23,207
-Say what?
-Well…

711
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,834
She wants to say something
about this case.

712
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:30,881
She says she thinks she saw that man
on the day of the incident.

713
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:40,516
This won't do. Hey, Uk.

714
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:44,353
Can you try reaching out
to that distant relative of your cousin

715
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:45,604
that you talked about?

716
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,022
-Right.
-Okay.

717
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:49,525
Well, I guess

718
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,902
-it's finally my turn to step up.
-Where is she?

719
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,280
She was sitting here earlier.

720
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,699
Right. Where did she go?

721
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,117
The restroom, maybe?

722
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,577
Are you asking me?

723
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,122
So why are you here again?

724
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:09,003
I saw Baek-du with the dead man that day.

725
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,212
On the coastal road.

726
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,924
Are you sure you saw them?

727
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:18,596
Why else would I come all the way here
at this hour?

728
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,390
Then, why didn't you
say anything until now?

729
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:26,478
You never said
you saw the two of them together that day.

730
00:43:26,562 --> 00:43:28,981
I didn't know it was that man

731
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,983
who was with Baek-du that night.

732
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:34,111
But after hearing what people were saying,

733
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:36,530
I came to realize
that what I saw that night

734
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:39,908
may have something to do
with why Baek-du was brought here.

735
00:43:41,785 --> 00:43:44,121
So what is it that you saw?

736
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:49,752
That night, I was doing yoga
on the rooftop of the building.

737
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,839
Now, count to ten.

738
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,966
Take a deep breath in.

739
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,176
One.

740
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,387
Now, exhale. Two.

741
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,681
Du-sik!

742
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,225
-Three.
-Oh Du-sik!

743
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:07,603
-Four.
-Du-sik!

744
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:12,358
And I heard some crazy man
shouting so late at night.

745
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,151
Du-sik!

746
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:17,237
Oh Du-sik!

747
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:20,032
Du-sik!

748
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:22,785
-It was Baek-du.
-Oh Du-sik!

749
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:25,496
He was obviously wasted.

750
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,375
Oh Du-sik!

751
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:35,047
He was staggering onto the road,
unaware of a car approaching.

752
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,675
-He could've been hit at any time.
-Car…

753
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:07,371
But he got lucky. He didn't die.

754
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:14,002
It seemed they had
a bit of a scuffle, though.

755
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,630
Mr. Kim.

756
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:20,384
We even have a witness
in our police station right now.

757
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:22,428
-A witness?
-Yes.

758
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,888
According to the witness,

759
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:29,435
the two of you had a scuffle
on the coastal road.

760
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:32,312
-But…
-So I asked the witness,

761
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:35,107
"Why were they fighting?"

762
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:38,318
Then, the witness said you were trying

763
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,863
to give something to Choi Chil-seong.

764
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:42,364
I was?

765
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,908
-Give him what?
-Money.

766
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,410
It was money.

767
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:48,579
Money?

768
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:53,125
Why would he try to give him money?

769
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:55,627
I don't know.

770
00:45:55,711 --> 00:45:58,464
I just thought he was doing that
because he was drunk.

771
00:45:58,547 --> 00:46:01,758
By the way,
you must have really good eyesight.

772
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:02,718
What?

773
00:46:02,801 --> 00:46:05,721
You could see that it was money
from the rooftop?

774
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,181
Of course I couldn't.

775
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:11,018
Then, how did you know it was money?

776
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,811
How could I not

777
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:15,189
when he was shouting out so loud about it?

778
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,486
Take it! You should take it!

779
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,070
What's going on?

780
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:25,199
-At the restaurant…
-What is he trying to give him?

781
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,701
Here! 40,000 won!

782
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,704
Take it.

783
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:33,707
Aren't you going to take the 40,000 won?

784
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:35,209
Did he say "40,000 won"?

785
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:41,089
Mr. Kim.

786
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,092
What was that 40,000 won about?

787
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,637
What was it about that money

788
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,098
that you had to try so hard
to give to him?

789
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,351
This is so frustrating.

790
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:53,894
Mr. Kim.

791
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:58,232
Could you please speak honestly now?

792
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:03,612
We even have a witness now, so it'll only
make things worse if you don't tell us.

793
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:07,699
Also, I need to know the truth

794
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:11,203
to be able to help you.
You know what I mean?

795
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:13,330
Yes. You're right.

796
00:47:18,794 --> 00:47:21,004
Actually, I…

797
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:23,298
I did something.

798
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,801
Did what? Did you hit Choi?

799
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,011
No, I didn't hit him.

800
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,139
I did…

801
00:47:32,307 --> 00:47:35,102
-I did something bad.
-Come on.

802
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,062
What do you mean?

803
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:39,273
Could you speak loudly and clearly?

804
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,899
I stole the money!

805
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:42,734
I kept the change!

806
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,747
Here's your change, 40,000--

807
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:59,668
What? Where did he go?

808
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:06,049
Give me the plates. How many chopsticks?

809
00:48:06,633 --> 00:48:08,927
What's wrong with him?

810
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:11,763
What am I supposed to do with this change?

811
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,976
I can't… He was supposed to take it.

812
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,022
It's actually been weighing on me.

813
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:22,232
Then, after a few days,

814
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,985
I heard in the neighborhood meeting
that the man died.

815
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:27,029
On the day after the reunion at that.

816
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:30,032
He threw himself into the reservoir.

817
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,951
Hearing that story

818
00:48:33,910 --> 00:48:38,081
made me feel so uncomfortable.

819
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:43,670
So I tried to give
the money back many times.

820
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:45,714
But…

821
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:53,805
Ms. Lim isn't usually
around the restaurant.

822
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:56,975
But since then, she's always been
hanging out in the restaurant.

823
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:58,935
Believe me.

824
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:01,980
It was driving me crazy too.

825
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:09,029
Detective, I haven't spent that money yet.

826
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,907
Could you please let it slide?

827
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:26,421
Billions of won? Murder suspect?

828
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:31,051
Chu, we need to talk.

829
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,983
Baek-du's been released!

830
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,403
He's clear of all suspicions.

831
00:49:49,486 --> 00:49:51,530
See? I knew he'd be freed.

832
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:53,824
We didn't have to stay here until so late.

833
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:56,785
We were all worried
for nothing, after all.

834
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:59,663
-I know, right?
-Well, I'm just glad nothing happened.

835
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:03,750
By the way, Baek-du sure is unlucky
when it comes to ssireum.

836
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:08,171
He was on a roll for once, and look
what happened. The cops suddenly took him.

837
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,507
So who's going to be the coach now?

838
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,009
Well…

839
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:15,804
What's there to think about?

840
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:18,849
Strictly speaking,
Baek-du threw in the towel.

841
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:20,809
-Right.
-But it's such a shame.

842
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:23,687
Baek-du actually seemed to be better
than Jin-su earlier.

843
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:27,315
She's right. Baek-du almost beat Jin-su.

844
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,025
Whatever.

845
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:30,777
I don't know.

846
00:50:30,861 --> 00:50:32,612
-Good night.
-Bye.

847
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:33,780
Thank you.

848
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:35,031
Let's go home.

849
00:50:35,615 --> 00:50:37,159
Gosh, what a day.

850
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:39,536
-Thank you.
-Good night.

851
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,079
-All right.
-Bye.

852
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,498
-Come on. Let's go.
-What?

853
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,916
-Do you not hear me?
-I do.

854
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,501
-Let's go!
-Okay.

855
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,092
Hey.

856
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,218
Yes?

857
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:59,473
I'll bring the 40,000 won back tomorrow.

858
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:02,809
Come on. Don't be ridiculous.

859
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:04,311
If that's what you think,

860
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:08,106
I should also pay you for
all the herbal tea I had at your place.

861
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,858
This is not the same as that.

862
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,445
Seriously.

863
00:51:13,528 --> 00:51:17,199
Baek-du is just hilarious.

864
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:21,286
If he was going to steal some cash,
he should've stolen big.

865
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:23,955
Why only 40,000 won?

866
00:51:24,039 --> 00:51:27,584
My goodness. It's just so embarrassing.

867
00:51:27,667 --> 00:51:31,296
I'm mortified to death. You know?

868
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:33,799
Come on. He's cute.

869
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,759
What are you saying?

870
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:40,597
This must be why everyone likes Baek-du.

871
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,391
That boy is just adorable.

872
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,107
I'm sure you don't know

873
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:55,362
that Jin-su was always outplayed
by Baek-du growing up.

874
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:58,698
No way.
If anyone, it would've been Baek-du.

875
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:00,158
Jin-su has always been good.

876
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:01,868
Oh, I don't know.

877
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,371
I could just see that.

878
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:08,875
So this time,

879
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,628
I almost hated Baek-du.

880
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:15,090
But he wouldn't let me.
Baek-du is just too cute.

881
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:18,593
Why don't you be his mom then?

882
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:21,388
I'll pay you for it.

883
00:52:22,430 --> 00:52:23,515
Jin-suk.

884
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,642
There's a poem that goes,

885
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:30,230
"Beautiful when looked at from afar.
Beautiful when looked at briefly."

886
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,357
That's what Baek-du is like.

887
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,193
What the hell are you talking about?

888
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:39,364
Come on. I used to love literature.

889
00:52:41,116 --> 00:52:42,450
Oh, whatever.

890
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,997
Ask me why I live…

891
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:47,956
There you go.

892
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:51,459
I will dance tonight

893
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:54,462
I will steal and steal big

894
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:58,258
He is coming

895
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,688
Mr. Kim Baek-du is walking out now.

896
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:12,606
Stop that.

897
00:53:12,689 --> 00:53:14,608
-Congratulations on your release.
-Stop.

898
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:16,318
You did a great job.

899
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:19,571
-Dad.
-Hey.

900
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,241
Eat this.

901
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,534
-What's that?
-Tofu.

902
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:26,453
-Put that away.
-Hey.

903
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:29,289
And you. What are you filming this time?

904
00:53:29,372 --> 00:53:31,625
"The moment Kim Baek-du got released."

905
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:35,795
When I start losing subscribers, I'll post
this video with this clickbait title.

906
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:36,838
It'll be effective.

907
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:39,633
-What are you saying?
-Don't touch the camera.

908
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:42,010
Wait. I think I got a nervous stomach.

909
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,845
I need to use the restroom.

910
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,555
Just poop at home.

911
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:48,058
No, I can't hold it for that long.
I'll be quick.

912
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,851
-Hey, come on!
-Mr. Kim Baek-du.

913
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:51,811
He can explode at any time now.

914
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,064
-Will you please stop?
-Don't touch my camera.

915
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:57,859
Now, Kim Baek-du is walking
into the police station of his own will.

916
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,947
Darn it.

917
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:05,951
Where is it?

918
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,161
Baek-du.

919
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:10,997
What?

920
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:13,583
Hey.

921
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,835
What are you doing here?

922
00:54:17,253 --> 00:54:20,215
Wait. Are you the witness?

923
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:22,425
You owe me one.

924
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:24,260
You better pay me back later.

925
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,891
What…

926
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:33,478
Darn it.

927
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:47,158
MEN'S RESTROOM

928
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:53,832
Come on.

929
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:56,376
It's been so long.

930
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,712
Let's go grab some food together.

931
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:00,797
Maybe next time.

932
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,091
I need to head back now.

933
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,634
Man.

934
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:07,762
Mi-suk, you haven't changed.
You're still so cold.

935
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:10,598
Mi-suk?

936
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:11,808
Chu Mi-suk…

937
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,188
That Mi-suk?

938
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,608
About what I said earlier,

939
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,820
please make sure to keep it secret.

940
00:55:27,032 --> 00:55:28,783
She's Du-sik's mother-in-law.

941
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,675
Hey, did you eat the tofu?

942
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:58,480
KIM GEUM-GANG
FIRST GEUMGANG-CLASS CHAMPIONSHIP

943
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:27,967
24-HOUR SCENE

944
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:37,519
EPISODE 157
THE PICKPOCKET'S TRUTH

945
00:56:38,686 --> 00:56:40,063
We received reports

946
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:43,108
of rampant pickpocketing
around the subway station

947
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:46,736
and went to investigate
in hopes of gathering information.

948
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:48,738
Most pickpockets' eyes

949
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:50,532
are fixed on people's belongings

950
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:53,118
such as handbags, rather than people.

951
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:55,662
And they are often looking around.

952
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,372
They sometimes skip trains,

953
00:56:57,455 --> 00:57:00,166
and only move when it's crowded.

954
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:10,176
That loser calls me
by my name so rudely. Damn it.

955
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:14,597
That's not how you treat someone
who saved you from getting stabbed.

956
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:22,230
We don't have much time. They won't be
keeping this secret for long.

957
00:57:22,313 --> 00:57:23,857
We've got to move fast.

958
00:57:24,566 --> 00:57:26,651
Words can easily spread.

959
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:32,490
You can go now.
I'll have a smoke before I go.

960
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,368
-Yes, Captain.
-Yes, Captain.

961
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,456
You can go too.

962
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:40,999
-Wait, Captain.
-Yes.

963
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,667
I have something to tell you.

964
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:45,044
You can go first.

965
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:54,095
When only one person leaves a group,

966
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:58,475
usually, the rest talk
behind that person's back.

967
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:03,313
He must've told me to go
so he could bad-mouth me.

968
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:07,025
How petty he is. He's just…

969
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,152
What's this now?

970
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:15,742
What's he doing there?
He should be eating some tofu at home.

971
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:17,785
Hey!

972
00:58:18,286 --> 00:58:21,331
Why are you so late?
I've been waiting for you for a while.

973
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,709
Why? Do you have something to say to me?

974
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:26,336
Do you, by any chance…

975
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:27,921
No.

976
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:30,590
We need to talk.

977
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:33,676
So what is it?

978
00:58:35,136 --> 00:58:37,388
Well…

979
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,683
It's about Yu-gyeong.

980
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,519
Oh Yu-gyeong? What about her?

981
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:46,397
You know something, don't you?

982
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,900
Me? What do I know?

983
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,944
The reason why Yu-gyeong came here.

984
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:54,489
Isn't that
why you approved this investigation?

985
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:59,994
You know
that this is a pretty reckless plan.

986
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,746
What are you talking about?

987
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,250
Anyway, what made you think so?

988
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:07,168
Did something happen?

989
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:10,838
No, nothing special. It's just that…

990
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,383
Things just looked a bit…

991
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:18,555
About Kim Baek-du,
the guy who was here for the interview.

992
00:59:18,638 --> 00:59:20,056
Yes. What about him?

993
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:23,393
I think there's something going on

994
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,979
between him and Yu-gyeong.

995
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:29,566
Gosh, why…

996
00:59:29,649 --> 00:59:31,484
-Were you always this strong?
-Come on.

997
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,111
-Let me…
-Just come here.

998
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:34,362
Let go of me!

999
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,407
Jeez, you're really strong.

1000
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,326
What is it?

1001
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,829
Just tell me already.

1002
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:45,665
I know this can be

1003
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:49,127
all sudden and unexpected, but…

1004
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,211
But what?

1005
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:51,921
You know

1006
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,258
we grew up together.

1007
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:58,511
And we share a lot of memories. Right?

1008
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:04,142
What are you trying to say?

1009
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:07,520
Du-sik.

1010
01:00:10,898 --> 01:00:11,899
Are you…

1011
01:00:15,653 --> 01:00:16,613
Are you…

1012
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:23,202
You mean there's something romantic
going on between them?

1013
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:28,625
Seriously, she's dating a guy
in this situation?

1014
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,543
No, that's not it.

1015
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:33,963
Jeez, you and Yu-gyeong are so similar.

1016
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:34,922
What is it then?

1017
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:37,258
I just feel like

1018
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:41,346
they already knew each other.

1019
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:43,097
They already knew each other?

1020
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:45,767
Yes. So I'm just worried

1021
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:48,853
that Kim Baek-du might find out
what we're doing here.

1022
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,271
No way.

1023
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:55,735
From what I saw earlier,
he seemed somewhat innocent.

1024
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,279
True, but…

1025
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:02,950
People like him can be pretty sharp.

1026
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:06,329
They look slow on the outside,

1027
01:01:07,163 --> 01:01:09,415
but are actually deeply intuitive.

1028
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:14,462
Are you…

1029
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,216
a cop?

1030
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,594
-You are, right?
-What?

1031
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:25,390
That face means you are.

1032
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:26,724
You are a cop.

1033
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:28,893
Wait, how did you…

1034
01:01:28,976 --> 01:01:31,854
How did you know?

1035
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,107
Does it matter?

1036
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,191
It does.

1037
01:01:36,401 --> 01:01:40,488
So, tell me. How did you find out?

1038
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:43,366
Your mother-in-law.

1039
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:46,411
She's that woman.

1040
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:49,539
Mi-suk.

1041
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:51,791
Your role model.

1042
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:56,879
What? You're surprised?

1043
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:59,590
I still have one more question to ask you.

1044
01:02:03,678 --> 01:02:04,887
Du-sik.

1045
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:08,683
You…

1046
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,186
You are…

1047
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,110
You're not married, right?

1048
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,071
What?

1049
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:26,200
And when they're being intuitive,

1050
01:02:26,951 --> 01:02:29,078
it's impossible to fool them.

1051
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:36,294
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

1052
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,402
I, Kim Baek-du,

1053
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:04,530
announce that I'm back
on the Geosan-gun Ssireum Team

1054
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:05,531
as of today!

1055
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,074
Let's go!

1056
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,493
Kim Baek-du!

1057
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:12,163
Why did you come back
if you don't even know the basics?

1058
01:03:12,246 --> 01:03:15,500
It hasn't even been that long
since the reservoir incident.

1059
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:17,084
I'm hearing weird rumors.

1060
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:18,252
Rumor has it

1061
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:21,380
that the coach asked Dong-seok
to let Baek-du win.

1062
