KOREAN <i>SSIREUM</i> CHAMPIONSHIPS

OH DU-SIK IS A GOOFBALL

4
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,351
<i>Welcome</i>
<i>to the 2023 Dano </i>Ssireum<i> Championships,</i>

5
00:01:00,435 --> 00:01:02,395
<i>live from Geosan, the home of</i> ssireum.

6
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,565
<i>Right now, a </i>Taebaek<i>-class match</i>
<i>is being held in Geosan Arena.</i>

7
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,035
<i>Heo Han-cheol,</i>
<i>from Hamwon City Hall </i>Ssireum<i> Team,</i>

8
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:20,205
<i>secures a victory</i>
<i>with two decisive throws.</i>

9
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,624
<i>Now, the next match is…</i>

10
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:25,543
<i>Gosh, I can't believe</i>
<i>these two are going head-to-head.</i>

11
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,961
<i>In the blue </i>satba

12
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,631
{\an8}<i>is Kim Baek-du</i>
<i>from Geosan-gun </i>Ssireum<i> Team.</i>

13
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:33,718
{\an8}<i>He's 32 years old, stands at 178 cm tall,</i>
<i>and weighs in at 78 kg.</i>

14
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:37,555
{\an8}<i>After being discharged from the military</i>
<i>in 2019, he placed fifth</i>

15
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:40,350
{\an8}<i>in the </i>Taebaek<i> class</i>
<i>in the last Chuseok Championships.</i>

16
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:43,728
<i>He was once called a rising star,</i>

17
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:45,939
<i>being the center of attention,</i>

18
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,482
<i>but sadly,</i>

19
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,735
<i>he has yet to earn</i>
<i>the champion title thus far.</i>

20
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,279
<i>However, I hope he wins</i>

21
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,449
<i>his first champion title</i>

22
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:00,078
<i>in this match today.</i>

23
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,211
<i>This match today</i>

24
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:12,590
<i>might be the last </i>ssireum<i> match</i>

25
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,675
<i>of my life.</i>

THE MECCA OF <i>SSIREUM</i>
GEOSAN-GUN <i>SSIREUM</i> TEAM

30
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,126
{\an8}This time, let's get a few shots
of them doing <i>ssireum.</i>

31
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,211
{\an8}- A round of <i>ssireum</i>. That sounds great.
- Yes.

32
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:52,463
{\an8}Let's see who we want in the picture.

33
00:02:54,507 --> 00:02:56,175
{\an8}Hey, Kim Baek-du!

34
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,845
{\an8}Baek-du, come here.

35
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:03,141
{\an8}Why does he always pick me
for things like this?

36
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,601
{\an8}Baek-du, he's calling you.

37
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,352
{\an8}- I know. Be quiet.
- Okay.

38
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,396
{\an8}Come on, Kim Baek-du. Now!

39
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:14,569
Trust me. I didn't want to do this either.
But they forced me to.

40
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,446
- Let's just get it over with.
- Okay.

41
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:19,741
He's no match for him.

42
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,868
- Will it work?
- It looks cool though.

43
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,204
Dong-seok is so fit.

44
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:28,374
Come on, sir.
Why would you take photos from there?

45
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,543
Don't worry. You look great.

46
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,878
That's not what I mean.

47
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,713
That angle is just dehumanizing.

48
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:37,425
From that angle,
my butt will look too big.

49
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,468
Oh, come on.

50
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:41,804
Nobody's going to know whose butt it is.

51
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,307
They're going to know.
The size is different.

52
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,309
He's got a point, Coach.

53
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,770
It'll be better if he looks nice too.

54
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:51,189
Please make Baek-du
look nice in the photo too.

55
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,441
I'm not a butt model, you know.

56
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,151
Why are you fixed on that angle?

57
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,028
Don't think about the camera.

58
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:00,156
Imagine you're actually doing
a round of <i>ssireum</i>. Try to look natural.

59
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,908
Just throw him naturally.

60
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:03,451
We'll take care of the rest.

61
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:04,827
Dong-seok, be natural.

62
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,287
- Okay.
- Just be natural.

63
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,624
I'll buy you some chicken later.

64
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:11,584
I already have dinner plans today.

65
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,213
Knees up.

66
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,967
- Wow.
- Go!

67
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:20,760
- There you go.
- Nice.

68
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,053
- Attack him.
- Hold on.

69
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,638
Not too hard!

70
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,894
That was rough.

71
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,479
- That was awesome.
- Too rough.

72
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,274
Darn it. I said to go easy.

73
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:46,953
Do you think Lim Dong-seok will win
the championship again?

74
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,498
We never know.

75
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,959
You see, it's hard for us too.

76
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:56,838
We can't predict anything
until our wrestlers are on the sand…

77
00:04:56,921 --> 00:05:00,258
We can't… Gosh, Baek-du!

78
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,718
Could you please be quiet?

79
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,470
It's not a mouth exercise, is it?

80
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,308
Jeez.

81
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:11,185
Why do you have to be so loud?

82
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,313
By the way,

83
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:15,898
he seems so familiar somehow.

84
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,109
Because he was famous as a kid.

85
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,028
Right?

86
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,696
I knew it.

87
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,699
Wasn't he featured on TV
as a <i>ssireum</i> prodigy?

88
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,160
Sure, but not anymore.

89
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,203
By the way, sir,

90
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,332
please write a good article on Dong-seok.

91
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:33,458
Sure.

92
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:34,917
- Sir?
- Yes?

93
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,169
The article.

94
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,587
Oh, the article.

95
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,505
Of course. Don't worry about it.

96
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:43,009
Lim Dong-seok must be doing
a lot of interviews these days.

97
00:05:43,092 --> 00:05:45,511
He speaks
much more eloquently than before.

98
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,097
Oh, don't even get me started.

99
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,016
News, variety shows…

100
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,351
Everyone wants to interview him now.

101
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,519
Look.

102
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,855
These are the texts
asking if he's available.

103
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,608
Excuse me for a second.

104
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,216
What the hell?

105
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,014
Hey.

106
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:31,808
- Hey, Seok-hui.
- Hey.

107
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:32,767
Hey, man.

108
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,645
GEOSAN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
42ND ALUMNI REUNION

109
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,855
Excuse me, ma'am.

110
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,774
Is that car your customer's?

111
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:42,318
The sign clearly says "no parking."

112
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:44,445
What are you doing?

113
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,031
Five, six, seven, eight…

114
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:48,741
Shouldn't you be training now?

115
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:50,868
Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen…

116
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,829
Did you give up on the game or what?

117
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:54,831
No, why is this here?

118
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,041
Hey, have you really given up?

119
00:06:57,792 --> 00:07:00,336
- Hey.
- Oh, for goodness' sake!

120
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,879
What do you mean, "give up"?

121
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,006
I've been training until just now.

122
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,009
Oh, I see. I thought you skipped training

123
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,262
because you were feeling hopeless.

124
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,765
- All right. Take it easy, man.
- Wait, Cho Seok-hui.

125
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,351
Pay the reunion fee.

126
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,520
I was going to.

127
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,649
- There. I had…
- Hey, wait!

128
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:24,193
- too many coins at home. Bye.
- You little…

129
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:37,039
It's all done. Cho Seok-hui…

130
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,792
Check.

131
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,339
OH DU-SIK

132
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,269
You can pay here.
I'm working for the owner.

133
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,814
One set menu and a bottle of soju.
It's 10,000 won.

134
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,192
One second.

135
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,111
My goodness.

136
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,446
Please wait a second.

137
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,781
Gosh, what's wrong with me?

138
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,743
Jeez.

139
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,913
Where did it go?

140
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,880
Where is he going?

141
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:32,053
Here's your change, 40,000--

142
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,432
What? Where did he go?

143
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,238
OH DU-SIK

144
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,752
Let's drink.

145
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:05,920
Sure. Let's drink.

146
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,089
Hey, Baek-du.

147
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,259
You're too hasty, you know.

148
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,927
At the New Year's Championships,

149
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,429
you should've waited
before using the technique.

150
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,807
You shouldn't have just pushed it.

151
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,891
No, that's not it.

152
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,394
The problem is his <i>satba</i> skills.

153
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,354
Stop letting others reach your <i>satba!</i>

154
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:25,648
- <i>Ssireum </i>isn't charity.
- Enough.

155
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,441
He also gets too flustered

156
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:30,403
when the opponent lets go of his <i>satba.</i>

157
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:32,280
- Why are you like that?
- Why?

158
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,657
Could you stop lecturing him

159
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,410
like you're all <i>ssireum</i> champions
or something?

160
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:41,122
You all quit before your beards grew in.
What do you even know?

161
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,291
What?

162
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,586
We're just feeling bad for him.

163
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,004
- He's right.
- Yes.

164
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:52,091
He used to be so good as a kid,
and yet he never won any championships.

165
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,510
Because it's not for everyone.

166
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,096
- Hey!
- Hey, Champion Kwak!

167
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,974
- Hey, come on.
- Get over here.

168
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,726
Are you still not drinking?

169
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:05,021
You've retired already.
Grab a drink with us.

170
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,147
Drink with us.

171
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,442
You need the universe's blessing
to be a champion. Am I right?

172
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:12,862
You seem relaxed.

173
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,282
The game's in two days, and you're here.
You must be confident.

174
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,081
Guys, do you want to hear something funny?

175
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,207
- Sure.
- What is it?

176
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,668
One of the juniors on my team said

177
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:29,920
that he wished to compete against Geosan.

178
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,672
He kept going on about it.

179
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,217
So I said to him,
"Are you sure? Lim Dong-seok is good."

180
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,844
And guess what he said?

181
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,887
What did he say?

182
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,221
It can't be something nice.

183
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,432
"Come on. I'm not crazy."

184
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,100
"Not Lim Dong-seok, no."

185
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,186
"I want to wrestle Kim Baek-du."

186
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,357
Because that would be
a guaranteed win for him.

187
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,530
What happened to the prodigy, Kim Baek-du?

188
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:01,994
I mean, kids used to be scared
to wrestle against you.

189
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:05,081
It feels like that was in a past life.

190
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,708
Right, Kwak Jin-su!

191
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,628
What? You got something to say?

192
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,258
You didn't pay the reunion fee.

193
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,385
Oh, come on.

194
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:18,844
- Pay it.
- Pay it now.

195
00:11:18,928 --> 00:11:20,429
Hey, pay the fee now.

196
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:22,473
- Are you okay?
- Water.

197
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:24,183
- Give him water.
- Water.

198
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,851
No, that's alcohol.

199
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:29,313
That was alcohol?

200
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,191
Du-sik!

201
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,027
You didn't even come.

202
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,154
Oh Du-sik.

203
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:40,825
Oh Du-sik!

204
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,036
Du-sik!

205
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,875
Sik.

206
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,378
Oh Du-sik.

207
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,547
Du-sik.

208
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,661
Goodness.

209
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,915
Slow down when you turn a corner.

210
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,375
Okay?

211
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,404
Are you okay?

212
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:17,546
I said, are you okay?

213
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,350
Kim Baek-du, are you okay?

214
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:33,187
Yes.

215
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,439
I'm okay.

216
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:37,191
You can just go.

217
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,193
Are you sure?

218
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:41,695
If I leave, you'll regret it.

219
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,190
You.

220
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,654
- Are you…
- Come on. Get up now.

221
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,343
Gosh, you scared me.

222
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:48,888
Oh, please. Don't be dramatic.

223
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,974
Mom, why…

224
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,811
What are you doing there? You scared me.

225
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,564
You wouldn't get up,
so I was checking if you'd died.

226
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,401
Gosh, you ruined my morning.

227
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:04,194
When did you get back last night?

228
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:05,863
Last night?

229
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,115
When did I get back?

230
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,368
Don't you remember?

231
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,372
Did you drink yesterday?

232
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:16,498
Drink?

233
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,376
Did I drink yesterday?

234
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,003
How did you even come home?

235
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:23,255
Right. How did I come home?

236
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,882
Stop repeating my questions.

237
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:26,884
I'm the one asking, you brat.

238
00:15:26,967 --> 00:15:29,261
Just come on out
and have breakfast already.

239
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,347
Gosh, get out now.

240
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,849
- Jeez.
- Go.

241
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,730
Come on out now!

242
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,107
Coming.

243
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:50,407
Where…

244
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,416
So this is why it was aching.

245
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:03,170
When did this happen?

246
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:09,551
Move aside. Make way, everyone.

247
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:20,562
Watch the car.

248
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,653
I think it's that way.

249
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,624
Darn it.

250
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,807
Choi Chil-seong…

251
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,476
is dead.

252
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,110
Goodness. What is going on?

253
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,952
Hey, you over there.

254
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:19,079
What now?

255
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,831
- Going to training?
- Yes.

256
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,583
- Do you remember last night?
- No.

257
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:25,669
You're the one that made me drink…

258
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:28,505
Right. Hey, check this out.
Is this from yester--

259
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,758
Never drink again, even after you die.

260
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,135
Even the king of the underworld
will get mad

261
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,845
at your alcohol blackouts.

262
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,848
Hey. Did I do something stupid last night?

263
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,768
Goodness. You have a serious problem.

264
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,853
Do you really not remember anything?

265
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,022
- Last night…
<i>- I'm going to retire!</i>

266
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:49,777
If I don't win
the champion title this time,

267
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,987
I'll retire.

268
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,908
Who is he talking to?

269
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,035
Come on, Coach.

270
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:02,539
I didn't drink a single drop of alcohol.

271
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,625
I'm 100% serious right now.

272
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:08,170
I have witnesses here too.

273
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:11,298
Guys, you're the witnesses, okay?

274
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:14,927
Anyway, if I…

275
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,721
If I ever

276
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,099
take this back later,

277
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:24,353
then, I won't be Kim Baek-du anymore.

278
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,065
You can call me… Well…

279
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,025
Ji-ri.

280
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,486
You can call me Kim Ji-ri, then!

281
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,696
Kim Ji-ri sounds good.

282
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,659
Kim Ji-ri. I like it.

283
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,703
Mount Jiri is a good mountain.

284
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,706
But doesn't it sound a bit strange
as a person's name?

285
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,502
Go and explain to the coach what happened.

286
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,630
- Explain what?
- What do you think?

287
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,215
About retirement.

288
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,927
You said that because you were drunk.
You're weird when you're sober too,

289
00:18:57,010 --> 00:19:00,514
but when you're drunk,
you say a lot of dumb things.

290
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,641
You should apologize to your coach.

291
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:04,852
"Dumb things"?

292
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:08,647
What can you do after retirement?
Start a business? Be realistic.

293
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,233
<i>Geosan Patrol Car Number Two.</i>

294
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,319
<i>Head to the accident site immediately</i>
<i>and cordon it off.</i>

295
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,947
Anyway, go tell him you're sorry.

296
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,031
I've got to go now.

297
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,075
Bye, Kim Ji-ri.

298
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,791
That's not a dumb thing to say.

299
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,589
We'll begin the meeting
for the 2023 Dano <i>Ssireum</i> Championships…

300
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:37,176
What are you worried about?
Just think that this is for the best.

301
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:39,553
Don't you have compassion?

302
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,680
This is not about compassion.

303
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,599
Number three, Lee Ho-yeong.

304
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:46,768
I'm actually saying this
for Baek-du's sake.

305
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,063
To be blunt, holding on to false hope
is just a waste of time.

306
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,858
What if he never wins a title?

307
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:55,611
Then, will you take responsibility
for his life?

308
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,363
Come on. If he was that hopeless,

309
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,699
I wouldn't have kept him until now.

310
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,618
Number 21, Shin Gi-beom.

311
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,662
Sorry, I've got to take this.

312
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,830
Jeez.

313
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,916
- Hey, Coach Park.
- Hey!

314
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:11,627
How's Lim Dong-seok doing these days?

315
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,794
Dong-seok?

316
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,505
Well, of course.

317
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:18,675
He's as vigorous as ever.

318
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:22,596
That boy is a human bulldozer now.
He's in excellent shape.

319
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:26,850
Gosh, I really hope
he won't be one of our first opponents.

320
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:28,227
Well, what can you do?

321
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:31,146
Someone has to go against him.

322
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:34,733
Now, Geosan-gun <i>Ssireum</i> Team.

323
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,821
First, Lim Dong-seok in the <i>Taebaek</i> class.

324
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,620
Number 29.

325
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,372
Number 29.

326
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:50,999
Lim Dong-seok is number 29.

327
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:56,046
Next, Kim Baek-du in the <i>Taebaek</i> class.

328
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,366
28 KIM BAEK-DU
29 LIM DONG-SEOK

329
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:26,994
- Good work, guys.
- Thanks.

330
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,080
- Let's see.
- Wait, look at that.

331
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:31,707
Jeez.

332
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:33,750
What are the odds?

333
00:21:34,501 --> 00:21:36,461
Seriously, from the preliminary round?

334
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:40,632
I heard Baek-du said he'd retire
if he didn't become the champion.

335
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:42,342
This doesn't look good.

336
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,593
Baek-du.

337
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,804
Hey, Dong-seok.

338
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,764
Can you give us a second?

339
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,350
That's not how you do it.

340
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,061
- What do you mean?
- Come here.

341
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,814
Your left hand is wrong. Come here.

342
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:56,898
I'll show you.

343
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,693
- Did you grab my leg <i>satba</i>?
- Yes.

344
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,321
- Keep your body close.
- Okay.

345
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,656
And push me with your left hand.

346
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,199
You've got to push me.

347
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,201
Watch how I do it.

348
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:10,662
Close up and push.

349
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,499
Did you see how easy that was?
I threw you over just like that.

350
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,459
Right.

351
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,379
- Do you think you got it?
- Yes.

352
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,758
Adjust the technique to fit your body
and keep practicing.

353
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,219
- Left hand?
- You can come back now.

354
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:29,222
Use your left hand.

355
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:31,391
Don't let it idle. Push.

356
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,642
Good. That was great.

357
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,312
Baek-du.

358
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,106
- Come here.
- Why?

359
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,486
Have you lost your mind?

360
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,696
"Push with your left hand"?

361
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,491
Do you want to be pushed by his left hand?

362
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,159
What do you mean…

363
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,040
{\an8}28 KIM BAEK-DU
29 LIM DONG-SEOK

364
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,547
What did I just do?

365
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,343
Please keep us updated.

366
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:07,260
Sure.

367
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,478
Found anything from the car?

368
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,272
There's no ledger.
Even the dashcam was ripped out.

369
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:21,942
How about his phone?

370
00:23:22,025 --> 00:23:23,944
- Is it not there?
- No.

371
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,738
But I definitely saw him
holding a phone yesterday.

372
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,656
You saw it too.

373
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,827
Seriously,

374
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,704
maybe this place is cursed or something.

375
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,249
Isn't it strange?

376
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:40,627
This man has been off the grid
for almost a year

377
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,671
and then, he suddenly comes here to die.

378
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,632
- This is just…
- Excuse me, detectives.

379
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:49,136
Is that car over there yours?

380
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:51,221
Yes. Why?

381
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:54,516
It's just that it kind of looks familiar.

382
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,851
Come on.

383
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,520
There are tons of cars
that look like that.

384
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,980
You're right.

385
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:03,733
Actually, my uncle had
the same car until last year.

386
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,819
He lost his license after drunk driving,

387
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:07,737
so he has to walk everywhere now.

388
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,906
By the way,

389
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,367
which department are you from again?

390
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,083
- Good work, guys.
- Well done.

391
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,420
Keep doing as you learned.
I should've used a Clenched Interception.

392
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,090
- Jeong-hun.
- Yes?

393
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,718
Could you speak quietly when we head home?

394
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,136
- Fine.
- Let's go eat.

395
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,888
- Hey, just be loud.
- Let's go.

396
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:34,890
- Good work.
- Let's go.

397
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:35,849
Let's go.

398
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,225
Gosh, I'm tired.

399
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:39,811
- Beom-su.
- Yes.

400
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,104
- Let's go.
- Okay.

401
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,189
All right.

402
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,820
Baek-du, aren't you coming?

403
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:53,241
Go ahead. I'll join you soon.

404
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,853
{\an8}28 KIM BAEK-DU
29 LIM DONG-SEOK

405
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,314
Why him, of all people?

406
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,503
- Hey.
- Hey there.

407
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,837
- You're here.
- Hey.

408
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,589
- You came.
- Hey.

409
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,549
- Continue what you're doing.
- Hi.

410
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:56,054
So who is Baek-du's opponent again?

411
00:25:56,137 --> 00:26:00,058
His name is Lim Dong-seok.
He's on the same team.

412
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,937
Apparently, he's the best
in the <i>Taebaek</i> class these days.

413
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,355
Where is he from?

414
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:08,483
Where was it? Gongju?

415
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,069
Gongju has amazing chestnut bread.

416
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:14,114
Chestnut bread is tasty indeed.

417
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:16,157
Oh, boy.

418
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,368
Speaking of which,

419
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:21,496
last year's Baekdu champion
of the New Year's Championships

420
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:22,998
was from Gongju too.

421
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,292
Gongju is on fire these days.

422
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,795
Geosan is now all washed up.

423
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,047
Come on. We've got Jin-su.

424
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:34,009
Come on. He's retired.

425
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,385
Plus, Jin-su wrestled

426
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,096
in teams from the Seoul metropolitan area.

427
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:40,307
He's practically an emigrant.

428
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,476
Do you think Baek-du can be the champion?

429
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,147
That's not the problem.

430
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:51,651
You see, I had a dream a few days ago.

431
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:09,085
GEOSAN 08

432
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,302
<i>And I saw Jun-hui in the dream.</i>

433
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:20,013
- Jun-hui?
- Yes.

434
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,766
In the dream,
I saw Baek-du hurrying somewhere.

435
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:26,061
I got curious
and watched where he was going.

436
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:29,272
Then, I saw Jun-hui standing there.

437
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,733
He was beckoning Baek-du over.

438
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:35,070
It was a dream,
but I felt like he shouldn't go there.

439
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:39,074
So I tried to shout,
"Baek-du! You shouldn't go there!"

440
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:41,242
But my throat wouldn't let any sound out.

441
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,495
- I couldn't say anything.
- Oh, dear.

442
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,790
Even after waking up from the dream,
something didn't feel right.

443
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,875
Something bad might happen to Baek-du.

444
00:27:48,958 --> 00:27:51,544
Don't be silly. It's just a stupid dream.

445
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,713
You said my dreams were visionary.

446
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:56,591
You even said
you'd buy one of my lucky dreams.

447
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:01,221
You better not mention this to Tae-baek…

448
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:34,337
What was I saying?

449
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,339
- What?
- What?

450
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:40,510
Something about Tae-baek.

451
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:43,096
- Right.
- Tae-baek?

452
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,975
Is Tae-baek coming tomorrow?

453
00:28:48,101 --> 00:28:52,063
Well, this might be his son's last game,
so I'm sure he will. Right?

454
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,148
- Sure.
- Sure.

455
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,901
GEOSAN COUNTY OFFICE

456
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,486
<i>No, he won't be here.</i>

457
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,989
Really? Are you sure?

458
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:05,744
Yes. Since Geosan's hosting such
a big game for the first time in a while,

459
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,746
the association invited him

460
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:10,915
- to the game, apparently.
- But why did he turn them down?

461
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,711
I'm not sure.
I didn't hear further details.

462
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,423
Well, isn't it obvious?

463
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:22,385
The great Kim Tae-baek is too proud

464
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:26,181
to see his own son
being humbled in front of everyone.

465
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:27,932
It'd be mortifying.

466
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,436
Little did he know this would happen

467
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,689
when he was acting all haughty back then.

468
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,525
What's that?

469
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,153
- Tomorrow's welcome speech?
- Yes.

470
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,322
All right.

471
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:43,907
Let me see.

472
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:48,536
"Hello, ladies and gentlemen."

473
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:52,332
"Welcome to the region of passion
as hot as the scorching sun in June."

474
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,834
"I'm the governor of Geosan-gun,
Hong Man-sik."

475
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:56,294
I like the opening.

476
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:01,800
"I would like to extend
a warm welcome to all the teams

477
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:06,679
that have come to Geosan to participate
in the 2023 Dano <i>Ssireum</i> Championships."

478
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,641
No, leave it. I'll take it.

479
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,188
Hello.

480
00:30:15,271 --> 00:30:18,733
Governor of our safe Geosan,
Hong Man-sik, speaking.

481
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,193
Yes.

482
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:21,778
What?

483
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:25,740
Hold on. What did you just say?

484
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:27,867
Where?

485
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:29,661
Seoul?

486
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,329
At the office?

487
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,917
What a strange woman.

488
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,379
Why is she using that in the shade?

489
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,714
Come on. We've all been there.

490
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,550
On rainy days, we sometimes forget

491
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,344
to fold our umbrellas
before entering a subway station.

492
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:51,641
She'll realize what she's doing
after she pokes someone's eye with it.

493
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:54,018
- Right.
- You're right.

494
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,664
She's leaving.

495
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:18,084
- What was that?
- No idea. She has the ears of a fox.

496
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,920
What does that mean?

497
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:30,889
Coach, are you leaving?

498
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,181
No, don't mind me.

499
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,069
- Hi, Coach.
- Hey.

500
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,446
Hi.

501
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:49,198
So how are you feeling?

502
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,701
Good. I'm feeling great.

503
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,328
That's great to hear.

504
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:55,413
I'm in excellent condition.

505
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,919
How funny is it?

506
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:01,920
What do you mean?

507
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,506
I'm talking about the tournament draw.

508
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,467
What a twist of fate, right?

509
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,636
It's a tournament.

510
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,138
That means we'd be matched up eventually.

511
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,389
But still…

512
00:32:13,473 --> 00:32:15,183
Come on, Coach.

513
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,685
I'm Kim Baek-du. You know me.

514
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:21,814
There was a time
when nobody could hold a candle to me.

515
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,610
Of course I know that.

516
00:32:25,693 --> 00:32:28,696
I know you used to be quite great.

517
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,531
Actually, I've been thinking

518
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:34,661
I wanted to go against Dong-seok.
That I stand a chance.

519
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,122
But I made a mistake.

520
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:39,999
- What mistake?
- I accidentally

521
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,960
shared my secret skill with him,

522
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:44,212
- and now he's slightly ahead of me.
- Oh, no!

523
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,089
What a shame, you know?

524
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,840
No way!

525
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,926
Why did you do that?

526
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,553
If you hadn't,
you would be the next champion.

527
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,722
I know. I would be the champion!

528
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,445
- About what I said
- What?

529
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,114
over the phone the other day…

530
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,866
Oh, that. Don't worry about it.

531
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,703
I know it was the alcohol talking.

532
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:18,997
Right.

533
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,583
What's wrong?

534
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,587
Did you actually mean it?

535
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:39,308
C-O-F-F-E-E.

536
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:44,272
I swear there was only one "E"
when I learned the word.

537
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,983
Anyway,

538
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:50,361
missing this one "E"
gave me quite some trouble.

539
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:56,993
Yesterday, someone drowned
in a reservoir in this town.

540
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:01,998
And apparently, that person had
some coffee here before it happened.

541
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:04,792
The next day, the detectives…

542
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,421
God, those damn bastards.

543
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:12,175
At first, they suspected
that I poisoned his coffee or something.

544
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,469
Then, they ran out of things
to pressure me with,

545
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,679
so they started picking on the spelling,

546
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:19,182
asking why there's
only one "E" in "coffee."

547
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:24,395
That's why I'm correcting it now.
Because I don't want to be wronged.

548
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,358
You don't seem surprised at all.

549
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:34,697
I mean, most people would
at least pretend to be surprised

550
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,116
if they heard about someone's death.

551
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:42,371
But you seem very calm,
as if you knew about it already.

552
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,373
I didn't expect this.

553
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,669
Anyway, that's what happened.

554
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:53,007
You know they say,
"A soft answer turns away wrath."

555
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:57,011
But because they were so rude to me,

556
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:00,473
even if I did see something,

557
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,433
I wouldn't have told them.

558
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:09,065
Hey, I thought you went to Seoul.

559
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,359
No. I'll leave in a few days.

560
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,914
Shouldn't there be one "E"?

561
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,834
Why are you changing it?

562
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:04,871
EMPEROR OF <i>SSIREUM</i>, KIM TAE-BAEK, EMBARKS
ON A NEW CHAPTER AS A GINSENG DIGGER

563
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,340
What in the…

564
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:22,138
Why is she using that?
The sun's gone down already.

565
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,807
How strange. Goodness.

566
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:28,686
Mom!

567
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,904
Hey, no need to run.

568
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:42,241
- Jeez.
- Why is she using that in the evening?

569
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,242
Hey.

570
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,493
- Have you eaten yet?
- No.

571
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,995
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

572
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,079
Jeez.

573
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,834
What's the matter?

574
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:54,086
- What is it?
- Nothing.

575
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,046
Come on. Hurry.

576
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,964
- I'm so hungry.
- Fine. Let's go.

577
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,467
Hey, you carry this, okay?

578
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,721
If you're so hungry,
why didn't you get yourself some food?

579
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,224
What are you doing? Come on.

580
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,198
Mom.

581
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:27,119
You know I have a game tomorrow.
I can't just eat vegetables.

582
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:30,748
It's not like you never won
because you didn't eat meat.

583
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,796
Goodness. There they go again.

584
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,675
The babies were switched at birth again.

585
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:43,844
It doesn't happen that often
in real life, you know.

586
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,222
- Jeez.
- Maybe it does.

587
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,015
I might have been switched too.

588
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:50,810
Who knows?

589
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,520
Maybe your real third son is

590
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:55,940
some successful 140 kg
Baekdu-class wrestler now.

591
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:59,318
He and I might've been switched at birth
in that ward.

592
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,696
Don't be ridiculous.

593
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,073
Why not?

594
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:06,158
Geum-gang is a <i>Geumgang</i>-class champion

595
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,703
and Han-ra is a <i>Halla</i>-class champion.

596
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,497
So Baek-du should be
a <i>Baekdu</i>-class champion too.

597
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,915
I'm the only one.

598
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:17,044
I'm the only lame one.

599
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:20,715
If you're gonna keep talking nonsense,
just go to bed.

600
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,389
Mom.

601
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:32,727
About tomorrow's game…

602
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:33,978
What about it?

603
00:38:39,108 --> 00:38:41,027
What about tomorrow's game?

604
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,446
Never mind.

605
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:48,117
What is it? You're making me curious.

606
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,245
Nothing. I was going to say I'm nervous.

607
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,637
Isn't it strange?

608
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,474
- What?
- The detectives from Seoul.

609
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,352
Why did they come all the way here
to check the scene?

610
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,604
You're still on that?

611
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:20,066
Didn't they say yesterday
that they were just passing by--

612
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:23,611
Hey! Driving four hours from Seoul
isn't just passing by.

613
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:28,491
And I definitely saw that SUV
in front of the restaurant the other day.

614
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,744
Something's definitely fishy.

615
00:39:32,244 --> 00:39:33,245
Okay.

616
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:54,433
2023 GEOSAN DANO <i>SSIREUM</i> CHAMPIONSHIPS

617
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,268
- Gosh, it's been a while.
- Hello.

618
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,437
Nice to meet you.

619
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,689
Thanks for your hard work.

620
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,400
Thank you all.

621
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,569
- Hey, Kim Tae-baek's here!
- Thanks.

622
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,656
- He hasn't changed one bit.
- He really hasn't.

623
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,491
What's going on?

624
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,535
Didn't you say he was in the mountains?

625
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:15,329
- I was clearly told he wouldn't come.
- But he did.

626
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,706
And he's not even alone.

627
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:21,961
Goodness, Champion Kim Tae-baek.

628
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,004
- It's been a while, Man-sik.
- Ma…

629
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,298
Right.

630
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,717
I'm so honored to have you here.

631
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,303
Cut it out. You're just embarrassing me.

632
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,721
Let's have a seat.

633
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,816
Hello. Thank you.

634
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:16,599
<i>Healthy bean sprouts good for your body…</i>

635
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:18,392
Did I add too much sugar?

636
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,230
Try it.

637
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,445
What do you think? Too sweet?

638
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:31,947
- No.
- Really?

639
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:33,324
To me, it's perfect.

640
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:38,370
And I never even measure.

641
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:41,790
By the way,

642
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:45,503
the arena is not so far from here.

643
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,630
Why don't you go and cheer for him?

644
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:48,839
No way.

645
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:53,761
Why would I go all the way there
to watch those boring matches?

646
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,847
My gosh. Jin-su said the exact same thing.

647
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,517
But today's game is not like other games.

648
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,562
Today might be that day for Baek-du.

649
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,733
What day?

650
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,319
What do you mean?

651
00:42:10,986 --> 00:42:14,323
Jeez, you really don't know anything.

652
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:16,700
Today, Baek-du…

653
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,036
What the heck was that?

654
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,579
You've got to be kidding me!

655
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:23,582
Are you serious right now?

656
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,629
{\an8}This is my heart and history!

657
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:29,838
{\an8}Come back here!

658
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:34,218
{\an8}I'm going to find you and kick your butt!

659
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:35,970
{\an8}Okay?

660
00:42:38,347 --> 00:42:39,223
Jeez.

661
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:48,941
Let's go, Kim Baek-du!

662
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,193
- Go, Baek-du!
- Let's go!

663
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:59,285
I bet you had no choice
but to behave growing up.

664
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:01,620
You never challenged your dad, did you?

665
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,790
If I were you,
I wouldn't have even dreamed of doing it.

666
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:05,874
Don't be ridiculous.

667
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,128
The final boss in my family
isn't even here today.

668
00:43:10,796 --> 00:43:11,964
This won't do.

669
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:15,217
- What are you doing? What?
- Nothing. I'll be right back.

670
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,760
- Where are you going?
- I know.

671
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,513
- He's going to poop.
- There goes Mr. Poop.

672
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:21,849
He should put that energy into the match.

673
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,910
I'm already tired
from putting the <i>satba</i> on.

674
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:01,847
What's going on?

675
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,808
Who is he talking to so seriously?

676
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,270
Baek-du!

677
00:44:10,689 --> 00:44:12,399
Come on. You're up soon.

678
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:13,692
Sure. I'm coming.

679
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,009
Nice Clenched Interception!

680
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,678
- It's a Lifting Throw.
- Lifting…

681
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,516
Sir, two of our wrestlers
will be competing in the next match.

682
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,185
Is that so? Two wrestlers?

683
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:51,313
Wait, two?

684
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:56,819
<i>Now, the next match is…</i>

685
00:44:57,694 --> 00:45:00,406
<i>Gosh, I can't believe</i>
<i>these two are going head-to-head.</i>

686
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:01,990
<i>In the blue </i>satba

687
00:45:02,074 --> 00:45:04,535
<i>is Kim Baek-du</i>
<i>from Geosan-gun </i>Ssireum<i> Team.</i>

688
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:08,580
<i>He's 32 years old, stands at 178 cm tall,</i>
<i>and weighs in at 78 kg.</i>

689
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:12,376
<i>After being discharged from the military</i>
<i>in 2019, he placed fifth</i>

690
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:14,962
<i>in the </i>Taebaek<i> class</i>
<i>in the last Chuseok Championships.</i>

691
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:17,756
<i>He was once called a rising star,</i>

692
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,259
<i>being the center of attention,</i>

693
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:22,678
<i>but sadly, he has yet to earn…</i>

694
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,471
<i>I'm going to retire.</i>

695
00:45:26,598 --> 00:45:31,019
<i>That wasn't just some random</i>
<i>drunk babbling the other night.</i>

696
00:45:31,103 --> 00:45:35,732
<i>I accidentally spilled out</i>
<i>what was on my mind.</i>

697
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,695
<i>I've been thinking about it</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

698
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,905
<i>"What's the point of continuing</i>

699
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,950
<i>something I'm so horrible at?"</i>
<i>This has been weighing on me.</i>

700
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,454
<i>This will be it.</i>

701
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:51,331
<i>If I fail to be the champion again,</i>

702
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,001
<i>I will quit for real.</i>

703
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:59,590
<i>Blue </i>satba<i>,</i>
<i>Geosan-gun </i>Ssireum<i> Team's Kim Baek-du!</i>

704
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,401
<i>Jin-su told me</i>

705
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,320
<i>that Baek-du said</i>

706
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:25,949
<i>if he didn't become the champion today,</i>
<i>he was going to retire.</i>

707
00:46:26,033 --> 00:46:27,826
That damn brat.

708
00:46:28,452 --> 00:46:30,454
How could he not tell me?

709
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:31,830
<i>Contending against him is</i>

710
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:35,083
<i>Champion Lim Dong-seok</i>
<i>from the same Geosan-gun </i>Ssireum<i> Team.</i>

711
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:37,294
<i>He's 24 years old,</i>

712
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:40,631
<i>stands at 185 cm tall,</i>
<i>and weighs in at 79 kg.</i>

713
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,424
<i>He's won</i>

714
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:45,427
<i>a whopping six championships</i>
<i>in the </i>Taebaek<i> class.</i>

715
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:46,720
Darn it.

716
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:49,431
Is Coach Park's hand cursed or what?

717
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:52,976
How the hell could he mess up
the draw like this? God damn it.

718
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:08,283
Baek-du. Don't underestimate experience.

719
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,285
When he was wearing a diaper,

720
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,704
you were already in your <i>satba.</i>

721
00:47:12,788 --> 00:47:14,414
You're much more experienced.

722
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,624
Okay.

723
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,711
Blue, red.

724
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,881
<i>Champion Lim Dong-seok</i>

725
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:26,009
<i>is certainly on a streak now.</i>

726
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,053
- Go, Baek-du!
<i>- Since winning</i>

727
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:30,222
<i>his first champion title in 2021,</i>

728
00:47:30,305 --> 00:47:32,099
<i>he's always been at the top.</i>

729
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:34,101
<i>Right. Champion Lim Dong-seok</i>

730
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:38,105
<i>never really stood out</i>
<i>when he was in high school.</i>

731
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:42,067
<i>Since Coach Yeon Sang-cheol,</i>
<i>the coach of his current team,</i>

732
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,860
<i>recruited him,</i>

733
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:48,282
<i>his skills have improved drastically,</i>
<i>bringing him to where he is now.</i>

734
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:52,202
<i>The coach must be so proud</i>

735
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:54,162
<i>of his keen eye for talent.</i>

736
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,707
<i>- Even now…</i>
- Grab <i>satbas.</i>

737
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,208
<i>He's coaching him.</i>

738
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,751
<i>That's not why.</i>

739
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:03,130
<i>When two wrestlers from the same team</i>
<i>compete against each other,</i>

740
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,715
<i>the coach is supposed to coach</i>

741
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:08,135
<i>the wrestler in the blue </i>satba<i>,</i>
<i>according to the rules.</i>

742
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,886
Gosh, he's going to lose.

743
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:13,348
Why would he let him
grab his <i>satba</i> so generously?

744
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:15,851
That kind boy is
certainly going to Heaven.

745
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,687
Baek-du, don't let him get a head start.

746
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:21,148
They stood up.

747
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:32,367
He's trying a Lifting Throw.
Will he be able to throw him over?

748
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:43,045
<i>Lim wins the first round</i>
<i>in just five seconds!</i>

749
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:44,755
<i>Lim Dong-seok didn't use</i>

750
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:47,466
<i>the Hook skill, which is his specialty.</i>

751
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:50,260
<i>Instead, he lifted Kim</i>
<i>as soon as the match began</i>

752
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:52,763
<i>to throw him, but it didn't work out.</i>

753
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,806
- That was amazing.
<i>- So he let him down</i>

754
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,100
<i>and hooked his ankle.</i>

755
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,727
<i>That was incredible.</i>

756
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:24,503
Baek-du, hold his <i>satba</i> tight.

757
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:26,171
Pull yourself together.

758
00:49:27,589 --> 00:49:31,343
Even if you end up losing,
you've got to give it your all!

759
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:36,181
You don't want to lose and retire
by fumbling.

760
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,684
Then, you'll regret it
for the rest of your life.

761
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:07,254
Baek-du.

762
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:09,464
Baek-du.

763
00:50:10,132 --> 00:50:11,133
Hey, Kim Baek-du!

764
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,594
Don't be scared.

765
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,887
- Stay strong.
- Okay.

766
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,723
- Do you know what I mean?
- Yes.

767
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:20,225
All right.

768
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:26,106
If Lim wins this round again,

769
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,941
the match will be over.

770
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,236
Let's go!

771
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,404
Let's go!

772
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:35,031
Let's go, Baek-du!

773
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:40,871
Hold the <i>satba</i> tight!

774
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,877
GEOSAN-GUN

775
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,092
LIM DONG-SEOK

776
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,511
Knees up.

777
00:50:59,097 --> 00:51:00,557
Stand up.

778
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,691
A hook!

779
00:51:21,661 --> 00:51:23,997
Lim lifts Kim for a Lifting Throw.

780
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,666
But Kim holds out.

781
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:27,751
Hold out!

782
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,048
There you go!

783
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:36,343
<i>A counterattack!</i>

784
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,094
<i>Kim Baek-du!</i>

785
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:41,014
<i>He wouldn't let him win</i>
<i>with the same technique.</i>

786
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:45,352
<i>Kim seized the chance</i>
<i>and scored with a counterattack.</i>

787
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,521
Don't get excited.

788
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:48,980
- Come here.
- Okay.

789
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,774
See? You just needed to focus.

790
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,032
This is the last round.

791
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:00,450
- Hold onto the <i>satba</i>.
- Okay.

792
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:01,827
Dong-seok is tall.

793
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:02,828
So push him down.

794
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:05,288
- I did.
- Don't talk back.

795
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,082
Hold onto his <i>satba</i>, okay?

796
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:10,293
Breathe.

797
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:12,754
- Don't worry. You got this.
- Okay.

798
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:13,839
Let's go!

799
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,633
See? He can do it.

800
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:18,260
Gosh, my heart is racing.

801
00:52:18,343 --> 00:52:20,846
- He's getting the hang of it.
- I'm so nervous.

802
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:21,930
Blue, red.

803
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:23,723
- Focus.
- Okay.

804
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,308
Hold onto his <i>satba</i>, okay?

805
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,152
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

806
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,156
Kneel down.

807
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:46,079
- Baek-du may win.
- I know. Baek-du is determined today.

808
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:47,330
Ready.

809
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,385
Knees up.

810
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,722
Stand up.

811
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:10,854
Hook!

812
00:53:16,776 --> 00:53:17,611
Yes!

813
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:32,834
Hold out!

814
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:55,690
<i>Both wrestlers fell at the same time.</i>

815
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:59,486
We never know.

816
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:00,570
He won.

817
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:01,863
No, we don't know yet.

818
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:02,781
What now?

819
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,913
VIDEO REVIEW

820
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:11,247
They'll review the video.

821
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:20,173
Did you see it? Did he fall first?

822
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:23,343
Of course not! Baek-du definitely won!

823
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,886
What's wrong with the judge?

824
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,514
We don't need a video review for this.

825
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,141
This is not right.

826
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:31,559
Come along. Turn.

827
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:32,519
Take position.

828
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:51,538
According to the video review,

829
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:54,040
the blue-<i>satba</i> wrestler's elbow

830
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:57,252
touched the ground first.
The winner is the red-<i>satba</i> wrestler!

831
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:03,341
This is not fair!

832
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:06,177
No, this is not right!

833
00:56:08,073 --> 00:56:09,324
<i>Are you okay?</i>

834
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,078
<i>I said, are you okay?</i>

835
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:19,250
<i>No.</i>

836
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:21,961
<i>I'm not okay.</i>

837
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,715
<i>This time, I'm not okay.</i>

838
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:54,160
It's for the best.

839
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:58,164
It's not like you were going to wrestle
for the rest of your life.

840
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:00,625
This is for the best.

841
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,806
We're closed…

842
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:17,058
for today.

843
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,842
<i>I heard Baek-du lost unfairly today.</i>

844
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,096
We're out of coffee beans.

845
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:59,142
The guys had a meeting here
after watching Baek-du's match…

846
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:03,688
- Right. You don't drink.
- I do.

847
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:05,356
Sometimes.

848
00:58:14,949 --> 00:58:17,702
Did you watch Baek-du's match too?

849
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:21,247
Why would I? It's a waste of time.

850
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:24,375
I heard he did a great job today.

851
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:27,629
But he lost because of an unfair call.

852
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,507
It wasn't an unfair call.

853
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:34,219
From where I was watching,
I saw Dong-seok turn him over properly.

854
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:37,680
Baek-du's elbow
did touch the ground first.

855
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,183
So you watched it.

856
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,435
Did you watch it in the arena?

857
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:49,901
There's something
I've always wondered about.

858
00:58:50,568 --> 00:58:51,402
What is it?

859
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:54,614
Why do you hate Baek-du so much?

860
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:56,866
Did you have a fight?

861
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,743
Or did he not pay you back?

862
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,038
No.

863
00:59:03,164 --> 00:59:06,042
Then, why do you hate him?

864
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:09,128
I heard you've been friends
since you were little.

865
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:11,047
We're not friends.

866
00:59:12,423 --> 00:59:16,261
I have never thought of him as a friend.

867
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:21,724
<i>Baek-du was much closer</i>
<i>to this other kid than me.</i>

868
00:59:58,094 --> 00:59:59,345
What's all this?

869
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,640
<i>Who? Du-sik?</i>

870
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:06,352
How do you know Du-sik?

871
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:07,437
How can I not know?

872
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,232
Ever since I moved here,
I've heard that name hundreds of times.

873
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:15,069
This is great. I've always been curious.

874
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:16,279
About what?

875
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,032
Is there a story behind Du-sik's family?

876
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:22,452
What do you mean? There's no story.

877
01:00:22,535 --> 01:00:23,786
Come on.

878
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:28,124
I've seen people here wince
whenever they hear Du-sik's name.

879
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:29,542
Something happened, right?

880
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:55,902
How strange. Who put this here?

881
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,170
What is it?

882
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:18,341
What is it that freaks everyone out
whenever Du-sik is brought up?

883
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:21,719
Don't ask me. I don't know either.

884
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:22,970
Yes, you do.

885
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,431
I know you two were bosom buddies.

886
01:01:26,516 --> 01:01:28,935
- What friends?
- Bosom buddies.

887
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:31,521
What? Am I wrong?

888
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,899
Well, I guess we kind of were.

889
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:51,582
Are you okay?

890
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,353
<i>Are you okay?</i>

891
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,649
<i>I said, are you okay?</i>

892
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:23,489
Come on. Get up now.

893
01:02:26,534 --> 01:02:28,411
Only Du-sik has that.

894
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:30,455
Has what?

895
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,415
You know, what you just…

896
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:36,627
Du-sik is a girl.

897
01:02:38,963 --> 01:02:41,591
- What?
- Du-sik is a girl.

898
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:49,474
Are you okay?

899
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:58,775
Hey.

900
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:02,779
Are you…

901
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:09,786
by any chance… I'm asking just in case.

902
01:03:11,662 --> 01:03:12,497
What?

903
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:16,834
Are you Du-sik?

904
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,006
You are.

905
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:24,175
You're Oh Du-sik.

906
01:03:25,676 --> 01:03:27,720
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

907
01:03:51,410 --> 01:03:53,079
{\an8}<i>You're not Du-sik?</i>

908
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:57,208
{\an8}Why do you ask? Why do you want to know
where her family is from?

909
01:03:57,291 --> 01:03:59,210
{\an8}<i>Just think about it.</i>

910
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:02,088
{\an8}<i>If you were Du-sik,</i>
<i>would you like to come back here?</i>

911
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,506
{\an8}<i>Shouldn't you be training?</i>

912
01:04:03,589 --> 01:04:05,633
{\an8}I've retired.

913
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:07,802
{\an8}<i>Retired? When?</i>

914
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:09,428
{\an8}Did you really quit <i>ssireum?</i>

915
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:11,848
{\an8}<i>What are you going to do</i>
<i>other than </i>ssireum<i>?</i>

916
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:12,849
{\an8}<i>Who is it?</i>

917
01:04:12,932 --> 01:04:14,350
{\an8}<i>Who is this new person?</i>

918
01:04:14,433 --> 01:04:17,436
{\an8}<i>I'll be the new general manager</i>
<i>of the Geosan-gun </i>Ssireum<i> Team.</i>

919
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,813
{\an8}<i>I'm Oh Yu-gyeong.</i>
