00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,505
-I'm Baek-du. 
-I'm Jin-su.

3
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,425
I am Ground, starting with Du-sik!

4
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:53,136
-Baek-du, three! 
-Baek-du, Baek-du, Baek-du…

5
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,766
I am Ground, starting with Baek-du!

6
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,893
-Jin-su, three! 
-Jin-su, Jin-su, Jin-su…

7
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:03,021
Dad, can I go play with them for a while?

8
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:05,565
I am Ground, starting with Jin-su!

9
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,108
-Baek-du, four! 
-Dad?

10
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:17,702
What's taking Seok-hui so long?

11
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,414
I know. Why is he taking so long to eat?

12
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:26,878
Want me to tell you a scary story 
while we wait for him?

13
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:33,760
I'll tell you. 
Someone gets hired by some museum.

14
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:38,765
And this guy finds himself on night duty 
on his first day at work.

15
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,059
Night duty on his first day?

16
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,352
He should just quit.

17
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,688
The night comes,

18
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:50,193
and he goes up to the second floor 
where it's dark and empty.

19
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:55,824
Then he turns on his flashlight 
and looks around.

20
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,703
Fortunately, there's nothing unusual.

21
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:03,665
Just like any other museum,

22
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:07,502
there are some ceramics, jewelry boxes

23
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,129
and a portrait.

24
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:13,591
Then, the next morning,

25
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,928
he talks about his night duty 
with another employee

26
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,012
and passes out.

27
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,182
Do you know why?

28
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:22,642
Why?

29
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:26,354
His colleague says,

30
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:28,690
"What?"

31
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,318
"There's no portrait in this museum."

32
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,321
"And there's only a window there!"

33
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,493
It means it wasn't a portrait that he saw.

34
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:42,704
It was a ghost 
that was outside the window.

35
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,497
So what?

36
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:46,499
Is that supposed to be scary?

37
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:52,547
You guys must think a ghost 
is the scariest thing in the world.

38
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,590
You're wrong.

39
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,593
People are scarier than ghosts.

40
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:58,094
My dad said so.

41
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:00,471
People are scarier than ghosts?

42
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,812
What took you so long?

43
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,357
What's that?

44
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:14,068
-Is it a camera? 
-Yeah.

45
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,320
Get closer.

46
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:24,579
Wait, Du-sik, are you sure 
you opened your eyes?

47
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,582
Stop laughing. I'll kill you!

48
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,212
What? Hey, guys.

49
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:34,797
We have only one shot left.

50
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,382
I'll take it now.

51
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,844
One, two…

52
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:50,230
EPISODE 11 
THE CULPRIT LIVES AMONG US

53
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,441
Let me get this straight.

54
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:57,362
You're Du-sik, 
you're Uncle Cheol-yong's daughter, and…

55
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,949
And you aren't 
Du-sik's unemployed husband,

56
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,034
but her colleague who came with her,

57
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,287
and you're undercover detectives 
disguised as a couple?

58
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,413
Wow.

59
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,625
Maybe it's because he studied 
so hard for the police exam,

60
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,918
but he catches on quick.

61
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,172
What do you make of it? 
Do you think it makes sense?

62
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:17,674
Yeah.

63
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:27,392
So what are you investigating? 
Why go to such great lengths?

64
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,269
We can't tell you that.

65
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:33,439
It's a match-fixing 
and illegal gambling case.

66
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,278
Do you remember the man 
who drowned in the reservoir?

67
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,947
His name was Choi Chil-seong.

68
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,074
We'd been chasing him for a long time.

69
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,409
But…

70
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,705
Anyway, we've already solved that case.

71
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,916
But we're still here…

72
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,171
because we're looking for Choi's murderer.

73
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,257
The reservoir! Right?

74
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,676
That wasn't a suicide. What did I say?

75
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,386
I said it smelled like a murder.

76
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,805
But they said that was far-fetched

77
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:08,224
and that it was some ghost's doing, and…

78
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,351
Right.

79
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,603
Keep going.

80
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:18,318
We're looking 
for Choi Chil-seong's murderer,

81
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,321
and from what we've gathered so far,

82
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:24,782
the culprit is in this town.

83
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,287
And we think the culprit

84
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,708
is the one who murdered 
Uncle Cheol-yong 20 years ago.

85
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,631
But how are you going to catch them?

86
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:43,718
I mean, it happened over 20 years ago.

87
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,387
It'd be impossible 
to find any leads or evidence.

88
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:50,850
Earlier today, Choi's burner phone 
was turned on for a while.

89
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:58,316
At 14:36:19 on July 16th, 2023.

90
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,195
The signal was detected 
on Jungang-ro in Geosan.

91
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:04,906
No wonder 
it was nowhere to be found in the town.

92
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,949
The culprit must've taken it.

93
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,204
But why would they have turned it on?

94
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,498
What does it look like?

95
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,501
It was a really old model.

96
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:19,712
My dad had the same phone 
when I was a kid.

97
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:24,467
A stylus was attached to the phone 
with a strap.

98
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,956
I think I have it.

99
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:03,589
Then are you the culprit?

100
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,008
What are you talking about? Of course not.

101
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:08,719
I'm not. I just found it.

102
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,889
I'm telling the truth.

103
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,642
Where? Where did you find it?

104
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,687
In the hole Snowball dug by the reservoir.

105
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,815
Goodness.

106
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,693
You guys don't believe me, do you?

107
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,154
I'm telling the truth. 
I found it a while ago

108
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,448
when I chased Snowball there 
in the morning.

109
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:32,577
Seok-hui, you used to sound so sincere 
when we were younger,

110
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,579
but not anymore.

111
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,581
God, I feel so wronged.

112
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,207
Just hear me out.

113
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:42,712
Snowball was let loose way too often, 
so I began to find it odd.

114
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,757
I mean, how could a dog 
unleash herself like that every time?

115
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,009
Right?

116
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,510
Then what?

117
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:52,680
It meant someone unleashed her, 
but that's also odd.

118
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:54,640
Why only let her loose?

119
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,143
Why not take her or sell her?

120
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,686
So why?

121
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,355
So I tested it.

122
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,857
I unleashed Snowball myself.

123
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:07,028
Then she ran straight to that place, 
as if she was waiting.

124
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,030
-To the reservoir? 
-Yes.

125
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,699
She went into some thicket 
near the reservoir

126
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,701
and started to dig the ground.

127
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:17,330
God, I was so scared 
that there might be a dead body there.

128
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:20,249
But it was just 
that she'd buried her things there.

129
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,127
And the phone was one of them.

130
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:27,840
Then when she was barking 
near the reservoir last time, it was also…

131
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,885
I think she saw something there.

132
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:32,595
The duvet store guy saw her

133
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:35,473
on his way home 
on the night of the incident.

134
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:39,435
He heard some dog barking, 
then she popped out near the reservoir.

135
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:44,982
But Snowball's owner said 
she never barks since she's a pacifist.

136
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,611
She must've seen something.

137
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,781
She must've seen Choi Chil-seong

138
00:08:51,864 --> 00:08:53,574
-fighting with someone. 
-So?

139
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,743
Where's the phone?

140
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,918
This is the one.

141
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,426
Yes, I think this is it. 
It's the same as the phone I saw.

142
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,888
I turned it on earlier, 
but it turned off right away.

143
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,807
And it won't turn on again.

144
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,351
I see. I think it broke down.

145
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,603
But I can't be sure,

146
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,773
so I'll send it to Digital Forensics. 
Let's wait and see.

147
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,277
Oh, no. 
I thought it could be helpful to you.

148
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,820
But it isn't really, is it?

149
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,322
No, don't say that. It is helpful.

150
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,991
-It is? 
-Of course.

151
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,909
When I go back to Seoul,

152
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,704
I'll make sure 
to report your contribution to my boss.

153
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:42,290
Wow, you're not just a handsome face.

154
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,583
Sorry?

155
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,876
You're so kind too. That's not fair!

156
00:09:46,502 --> 00:09:48,296
Well, I…

157
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,549
Well, how about we be friends from now on?

158
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,593
Sounds good. I'll talk casually.

159
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,928
-I will too, Seok-hui. 
-Good, Hyeon-uk.

160
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,431
-It's good to have a friend from Seoul. 
-Right.

161
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,141
-Let's do this. 
-Yes.

162
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,826
Snowball, let's have a snack.

163
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,246
What was that?

164
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:24,790
Who is it?

165
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:34,550
I thought I saw someone. 
Maybe it was just the dark.

166
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,347
Snowball.

167
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:42,475
Don't go out and wander around today.

168
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,603
Just stay home, all right?

169
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,689
Or the police officer 
will make such a fuss again.

170
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:52,735
Do you know what Seok-hui's nickname is?

171
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,113
It's "Blockhead."

172
00:10:56,656 --> 00:11:00,826
He always goes around talking nonsense, 
so Geum-gang gave him the nickname.

173
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,870
What do you think? Doesn't it suit him?

174
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:05,748
He did it again earlier.

175
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,500
I mean, he thinks

176
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:10,544
Snowball is a witness to the murder? 
That makes no sense.

177
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,339
-I can't believe him. 
-Why not?

178
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:18,135
That makes sense to me.

179
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,096
What?

180
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,224
I think he has a point.

181
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:27,061
We shouldn't just brush it off.

182
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:35,486
I mean, someone really could have 
unleashed Snowball because of the phone.

183
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,533
Now that I hear you, it might be possible.

184
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,662
Gosh. What's gotten into Seok-hui?

185
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,415
He's helpful for a change.

186
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:52,545
They say, "Even a broken clock 
is right twice a day."

187
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,216
What?

188
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:59,051
Is something wrong?

189
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,011
No. It's nothing.

190
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,390
What is it? Tell me.

191
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,560
It just feels strange.

192
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:14,483
The person who did such a horrible thing 
is someone I know.

193
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:19,613
The fact that someone I've been greeting,

194
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:24,201
seeing, and talking with in this town 
for 30 years did such a thing…

195
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,370
I just can't believe it.

196
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,165
How could a human being do that?

197
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:34,086
Didn't I tell you one time?

198
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,049
That people are scarier than ghosts.

199
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,303
Don't trust people too much.

200
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,890
In the long run, that's better.

201
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,772
But you should still trust me.

202
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:55,191
What?

203
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:59,278
Even if there's no one to trust, 
you should still trust me.

204
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:03,282
Because I always… 
You know, from the bottom of my heart, I--

205
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:04,909
You…

206
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:08,412
You have to stop that, okay? 
Know when to keep it to yourself.

207
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,581
I'm getting goosebumps.

208
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,541
I'm going in.

209
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,503
All right. Good night.

210
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,178
I really don't think it's someone I know.

211
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:29,600
Hey, Snowball. Come here.

212
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:34,063
Did you really see something there?

213
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,898
Tell me.

214
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,107
Baek-du?

215
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,818
Oh, Mr. Park. Hi.

216
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,529
What are you doing here so late?

217
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,615
Well, I just…

218
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:47,826
I took a wrong turn, lost in thought.

219
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,995
What about you? What are you doing here?

220
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:53,916
Me too. I took a wrong turn too.

221
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:56,627
It's late. Let's go home.

222
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,296
-Okay. Good night. 
-You too.

223
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,192
They say it belonged to Choi.

224
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,488
Then what Seok-hui said yesterday 
must be right.

225
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:30,619
The culprit has been 
unleashing Snowball on purpose

226
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,955
to find Choi Chil-seong's phone.

227
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:37,626
Because they knew 
Snowball had taken the phone.

228
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,712
How?

229
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:42,715
Since they saw her at the scene that day.

230
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:48,971
The culprit must find out 
where she hid the phone.

231
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,389
Why?

232
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,435
Because there's something in the phone?

233
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,605
Something no one else should see?

234
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:01,817
If we use the intel we have,

235
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,111
we might find out who it is, but…

236
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,744
Coach Yeon.

237
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,954
The Dano Championships.

238
00:15:16,832 --> 00:15:17,708
The video!

239
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,085
What video?

240
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,004
During the match,

241
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,257
Coach Yeon kept looking at the audience.

242
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:29,053
Maybe we can find who it is 
by comparing everyone in this town

243
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,554
with the video.

244
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:35,392
ACCIDENT FREE

245
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,894
30 DAYS

246
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:38,604
Hey, Cho.

247
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,272
Come here for a bit.

248
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,190
Hurry.

249
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,067
What's wrong?

250
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,697
It bothered me all night,

251
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,241
so I ran over 
right after fixing breakfast.

252
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,201
What is it?

253
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,747
I'm not entirely sure if I saw it,

254
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,083
so I'm a bit hesitant.

255
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,918
Stop beating around the bush.

256
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,336
All right. I'll tell you.

257
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:07,007
I think I saw someone 
in my yard last night.

258
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:08,175
What?

259
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,927
I don't know if it was a thief,

260
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,639
but it looked like someone was 
really hanging around Snowball's kennel.

261
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,643
But when they heard me coming out,

262
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,436
they ran away, I think.

263
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:22,064
The CCTV. You installed a security camera.

264
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,482
Did you check the footage?

265
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,109
No one was caught.

266
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,987
I think they saw the camera

267
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:32,866
and stayed 
where they wouldn't be caught on it.

268
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:35,494
And their face? Did you see it?

269
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,372
No, it was too dark.

270
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:40,749
But I'm sure it was a man.

271
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,251
Darn it.

272
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:47,673
Oh, right. He seemed to be 
as big as a Taebaek-class wrestler.

273
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,675
As big as a Taebaek-class wrestler.

274
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,719
As big as a Taebaek-class wrestler?

275
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,391
Lim lifts Kim

276
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,475
for a Lifting Throw.

277
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,480
I've never seen this guy in this town.

278
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,525
That's Kim Myeong-su. 
He runs a vegetable shop.

279
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,154
He sells fresh vegetables 
with good prices.

280
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,740
Jin-su's Restaurant uses their vegetables.

281
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,126
-And who is the guy next to… 
-Lee Jin-gyu.

282
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:26,378
Hardware store.

283
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,049
Right, he said he sprained his wrist.

284
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,550
I wonder if it got better.

285
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,473
You're good at this, aren't you?

286
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:42,144
You must've really enjoyed your time here.

287
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:44,730
Hold on.

288
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,234
Hey, Seok-hui.

289
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,944
Yes.

290
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,615
-Did you sleep well? 
-He found his soulmate.

291
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,117
Last night?

292
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,204
Taebaek class?

293
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:01,872
Taebaek class?

294
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:13,133
I mean, what was he doing there 
at that hour?

295
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,552
It's just so suspicious.

296
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,817
But I can't suspect him 
just because he was there.

297
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,527
I was there too.

298
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,196
No.

299
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,616
I was there 
because I walked Du-sik home.

300
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,494
But Mr. Park… 
What was he doing there alone?

301
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:42,955
What are you mumbling about?

302
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:45,124
Gosh. Hello, Mr. Park.

303
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,126
-Going to the gym? 
-Yes.

304
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:49,920
-The match is soon, right? 
-Yes.

305
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:53,674
Judging by your performance last time, 
I think you're in great shape.

306
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:54,675
Right.

307
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:57,302
So can I have 
high expectations for you this time?

308
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:00,264
I think you stand a good chance.

309
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,517
-By the way, Mr. Park… 
-What?

310
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,269
Well…

311
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,192
Never mind.

312
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,902
I'll do my best.

313
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,864
Just a second.

314
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:17,865
Our dear Baek-du.

315
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:20,200
No, don't. You really don't have to.

316
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,911
-I can't take it. Don't. 
-You deserve some allowance.

317
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,330
-I insist. 
-Goodness, Mr. Park. This is…

318
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,666
Don't tell your dad.

319
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:28,625
-Okay? 
-Okay.

320
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:30,711
Thank you. See you, sir.

321
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:33,547
Gosh, he really didn't have to.

322
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,931
It can't be him.

323
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,517
Mr. Park would never do such a thing.

324
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:56,111
If he was as big 
as someone in Taebaek class,

325
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,199
then we should exclude 
people in Baekdu and Halla classes.

326
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:09,166
Then the people that are left…

327
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,088
JI-YONG

328
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,341
Hello?

329
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:18,884
Hey, about the phone.

330
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,761
I gave it to Digital Forensics.

331
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:24,097
The analyst asked if it'd been dug up 
as soon as he saw it.

332
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:28,477
It would've been repaired easily 
if the memory chip hadn't been damaged,

333
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,646
but it's damaged pretty bad, he says.

334
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,314
So it'll take quite a while.

335
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:34,608
Do you need anything else?

336
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,735
No. Thank you.

337
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,832
Are you Mr. Jang Dae-deok?

338
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,711
Answer the question, please.

339
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,005
You know who I am.

340
00:20:57,965 --> 00:20:59,216
Thank you for confirming.

341
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,134
So Mr. Jang,

342
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,471
what were you doing 
around 10:00 p.m. on June 7th, 2023?

343
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,265
What is that day?

344
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:09,017
That depends on what you did that day.

345
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,394
What's wrong with you?

346
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:15,857
Wait a second.

347
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,860
-On June 7th? 
-Yes.

348
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,655
I remember that day!

349
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,865
I ran a marathon in Seoul.

350
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,703
It was the first time I finished on time.

351
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,539
-So I remember. 
-A marathon?

352
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,332
Can you prove it?

353
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,167
Gosh, you… Over there.

354
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,172
SEOUL SONGSAN MARATHON 
JANG DAE-DEOK

355
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,133
-He really did. 
-You're right.

356
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:43,677
Thank you for your cooperation. 
Have a nice day.

357
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,762
-Bye. 
-Wow, you're a good runner.

358
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:50,767
It's not unusual for Seok-hui 
to go around doing stupid things,

359
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,937
but why is Uk playing along like that?

360
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,941
Since the match is coming up,

361
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:01,403
tell them to watch what they eat 
and stay in good shape.

362
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:03,739
Attention.

363
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,948
-Attention. 
-Attention.

364
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:07,284
-Are you whispering? Attention! 
-Attention!

365
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,996
The match is around the corner. 
Keep yourself on your toes.

366
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,080
-Yes, sir. 
-Goodness.

367
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:14,082
-Stay in shape. 
-Yes, sir.

368
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,293
-Louder! 
-Yes, sir!

369
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,295
-Keep it up. 
-Yes, sir.

370
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,465
-Don't slack off. 
-Gosh.

371
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,008
-Won-ho. 
-Yes?

372
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,509
You got to hold the satba tight.

373
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,552
-Got it? 
-Yes, sir.

374
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,054
-And Ho-deok. 
-Yes.

375
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,931
Like I told you last time, 
keep doing visualization training.

376
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,600
-Understood? 
-Yes, sir.

377
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:36,772
Hey.

378
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:39,274
Why aren't you running 100 laps lately?

379
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:40,817
What?

380
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,530
Oh, was I supposed to keep doing it?

381
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:47,908
Do it again starting today. Okay?

382
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,246
Jin-su.

383
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:55,749
What?

384
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:58,585
You…

385
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,673
Could you cut it down to 80 laps?

386
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,267
By the way,

387
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:17,771
no one in our town knows yet, right?

388
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,356
Know what?

389
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,109
Who she and Mi-ran are.

390
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,529
Of course not.

391
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,198
And don't tell anyone. She'll kill you.

392
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:31,785
But then, I should worry 
about Seok-hui, not you.

393
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:34,371
I just don't get it.

394
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:37,290
How could everyone not recognize her?

395
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:40,377
I mean, isn't it obvious? 
I recognized her right away.

396
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,837
Because she got so pretty.

397
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:43,755
What?

398
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,217
She's gotten so pretty. 
Of course they don't recognize her.

399
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,690
Are you Mr. Park Pil-du?

400
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,775
"Mr. Park Pil-du"?

401
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,028
All right. I'm Park Pil-du.

402
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,740
Thank you for confirming. 
Now, Mr. Park Pil-du,

403
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:14,286
what were you doing 
around 10:00 p.m. on June 7th, 2023?

404
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:17,122
-What's special about that day? 
-Someone died in the town.

405
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:22,919
You don't remember? 
It hasn't been that long.

406
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:27,465
You know, in the reservoir, 
a man drowned in a car.

407
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,926
Well, I must've been in bed.

408
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:35,056
People around my age tend to get sleepy 
as soon as the sun sets.

409
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,433
Then do you have

410
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:40,478
anyone who could confirm 
that you were sleeping at home that night?

411
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:43,690
Of course not. I live alone.

412
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,070
I understand.

413
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,031
Thank you for your cooperation.

414
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:51,990
Sure.

415
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,046
Gosh.

416
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:15,513
You know, in movies and drama shows,

417
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:20,894
when main characters are police officers, 
they usually have a story to tell.

418
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,729
Just like you.

419
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:24,481
And?

420
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:28,985
You know what they do first 
as soon as they become police officers?

421
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,656
Without anyone knowing,

422
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:36,201
they dig up 
an investigation report of an old case.

423
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:39,871
They almost get caught many times,

424
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:43,708
and despite all the challenges, 
they finally open the file.

425
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,671
Then it turns out

426
00:25:47,754 --> 00:25:51,258
-that the file is locked. You know? 
-Are you serious?

427
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,551
Stop watching so much TV.

428
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:57,138
Look. If I were you, 
I'd watch ssireum videos instead.

429
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:59,516
You're too carefree.

430
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:07,190
I looked it up too.

431
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,944
-Really? 
-I didn't even try to hide it.

432
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:15,407
So? What did it say? 
Was there anything that could be a lead?

433
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,993
You think it'd be dramatic 
like the movies?

434
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,121
It just said what I already knew.

435
00:26:21,705 --> 00:26:25,083
My dad and Uncle Cheol-yong 
had a big fight that evening,

436
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,085
and many people saw it.

437
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:32,215
And someone saw Uncle Cheol-yong 
heading towards my home that night,

438
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,717
so my dad became the prime--

439
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,969
Who was that someone?

440
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:36,928
Pil-du.

441
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,974
Right. You must've not known that…

442
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,478
Mr. Park again?

443
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,690
What? Is something wrong?

444
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,151
No. It's nothing.

445
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:52,944
Nothing's wrong.

446
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,740
Let's go, then. They must be waiting.

447
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:58,700
Okay.

448
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,625
Someone came 
to unleash Snowball again last night.

449
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:08,835
It could be the culprit.

450
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,712
Did she see their face?

451
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:11,713
No, she didn't.

452
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:16,134
But it seemed like a man as big 
as a Taebaek-class wrestler.

453
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:20,180
So Hyeon-uk and I 
excluded all the bigger guys

454
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:22,640
and checked the alibis of the rest.

455
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,184
But…

456
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:26,853
they all have alibis.

457
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,606
All of them? Are you sure?

458
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,816
We're not sure about one person.

459
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:33,360
Who?

460
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:34,652
Mr. Park Pil-du.

461
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:37,781
He's the only one 
who can't prove his alibi.

462
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:41,826
He said he must've been asleep 
since he gets sleepy in the evening.

463
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:42,911
But who knows?

464
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:49,209
But we can't suspect him based on that.

465
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:50,794
But, you know,

466
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,005
the culprit doesn't know 
we have the phone.

467
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:58,051
I installed a CCTV camera 
around Snowball's kennel.

468
00:27:58,134 --> 00:27:59,636
It might catch something.

469
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,099
If he really let Snowball loose

470
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:08,978
to find Choi Chil-seong's phone,

471
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:14,692
then he must be the one who killed Choi.

472
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:19,197
And if we think about 
what Choi said before he died,

473
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:25,161
what happened 20 years ago 
must've been done by the same person.

474
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,999
And the culprit is still here.

475
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,927
We don't have much time.

476
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:45,056
We can't just wait here and do nothing.

477
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:49,310
Let's find him before he gets wind of it.

478
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:54,107
I'm Joo Cheol-yong's daughter.

479
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,110
No way.

480
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,446
-Mi-ran is Cheol-yong's daughter? 
-What?

481
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,073
What did you just say?

482
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,492
I'm Joo Cheol-yong's daughter.

483
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,369
The one who died here 20 years ago.

484
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,080
You mean, that Cheol-yong?

485
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:12,917
Are you talking about the Joo Cheol-yong 
who used to live here?

486
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:16,546
Yes.

487
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,717
Now I see the resemblance.

488
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,676
Mi-ran.

489
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,969
I don't remember at all.

490
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,137
Have this.

491
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,430
Cheol-yong's daughter?

492
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,184
The one who died in the mountains 
a long time ago?

493
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,436
But did he have a daughter?

494
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,064
-Why don't I remember her? 
-Me too.

495
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,691
I remember her.

496
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:38,610
The girl was small and quiet.

497
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:39,819
Really?

498
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,614
I think she was shy. 
When I asked her something,

499
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,491
she'd hide behind her dad.

500
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,617
-Really? 
-Yes.

501
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:50,580
Then why has she never said 
who she was until now?

502
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,333
What is she up to?

503
00:29:53,416 --> 00:29:54,250
She's coming.

504
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,214
Oh, my. She does look like him.

505
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:12,727
What? I thought her family name was Mi.

506
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,356
Who has Mi as a family name?

507
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,024
What?

508
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,612
Come on. There are some people 
who have that family name.

509
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:25,907
Really?

510
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,746
Anyway, why did she reveal 
who she is now?

511
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,582
She must've thought it was time.

512
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,042
Time to do what?

513
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,253
Time to catch the culprit.

514
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,272
Rumors.

515
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:44,527
I have some experience 
with them, you know.

516
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,280
I know how strong they are

517
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,700
and how much they can stir up people.

518
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,537
So we will use that to our advantage.

519
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,957
Cheol-yong's daughter is back

520
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,961
and has evidence that could reveal 
the truth about his wrongful death.

521
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:06,758
If the rumor spreads, 
the culprit may step up and show himself.

522
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:07,675
But,

523
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:10,553
wouldn't that put Mi-ran in danger?

524
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,264
So I don't agree.

525
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:15,391
I'm down for it.

526
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:20,939
I wouldn't have come back here 
if I was scared by such things.

527
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:35,203
I told you hundreds of times

528
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:38,748
that she was so hard to read.

529
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:41,084
I was right.

530
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,253
But why didn't she say who she was 
from the beginning?

531
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,797
Would it have hurt her?

532
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,676
Why reveal it now? 
She must have an ulterior motive.

533
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:52,679
Gosh, you… Would you stop it?

534
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,305
What ulterior motive?

535
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,265
She must've had her reasons.

536
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:58,184
What reasons could she have?

537
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:01,771
Do you really not find it strange?

538
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:03,690
I mean, if I were her,

539
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:07,151
I wouldn't even 
look in the direction of this town.

540
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,695
What's this town to her?

541
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:13,408
It's the town 
where that thing happened to her dad.

542
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,869
So why would she come back here 
to run a café?

543
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,872
Selling coffee, beer, things like that.

544
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,293
-Goodness. 
-By the way,

545
00:33:24,919 --> 00:33:29,674
do you think your husband 
really doesn't know anything about it?

546
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:30,633
What do you mean?

547
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:34,721
I mean, he must know something 
about what happened.

548
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:38,099
It's been 20 years, so it's gotten better,

549
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:42,061
but he didn't even let us mention it 
until a few years ago.

550
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:47,025
You know, 
everyone remembers things differently.

551
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,069
So I want to know who's right.

552
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:53,740
You know what happened the other day?

553
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:58,745
Someone said I was the last person 
to see Cheol-yong before he died,

554
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:01,998
trying to make me the witness.

555
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:04,250
Wait. Wasn't it Yeong-uk?

556
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,418
Yeong-uk?

557
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,756
See? Everyone says different things.

558
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,508
I thought it was Pil-du.

559
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,385
-Pil-du? 
-Yeah.

560
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,597
-Hey. 
-Yeah?

561
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,307
Why do you think that?

562
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:31,235
Stop sighing like that. 
It'll bring bad luck.

563
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,864
What is it?

564
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:37,742
-You're acting weird lately. 
-Am I?

565
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,827
No, I'm not.

566
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,622
Yes, you are. What's wrong?

567
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,168
What's the matter? Tell me.

568
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,337
Hey, you know…

569
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:50,922
Well…

570
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,217
-By any chance… 
-Du-sik!

571
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:05,144
Did anything happen overnight? 
Or did you find anything?

572
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:08,523
No. If I did, I would've called you guys.

573
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:14,028
Since when did you call each other? 
You two spoke formally until recently.

574
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:14,946
Look.

575
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,032
I just happened to hear what my mom said.

576
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:21,828
Do you know the last person 
to see Uncle Cheol-yong?

577
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,412
Hey, that's…

578
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,414
-She found that out way-- 
-Who is it?

579
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:27,667
Mr. Park Pil-du.

580
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:33,047
She said he was the last one 
to see Uncle Cheol-yong before he died.

581
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,716
Is that so?

582
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,052
Okay, thanks.

583
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:39,971
I'll keep that in mind.

584
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:47,562
Hey, I'll go first.

585
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:51,107
You guys take your time, okay?

586
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:55,027
What's with you? We can just go together. 
Why would you…

587
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,155
Baek-du!

588
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,782
You said you had something to tell me.

589
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:01,868
Hey.

590
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,539
He's just so adorable.

591
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:14,797
Mi-ran, are you 
really Cheol-yong's daughter?

592
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:17,758
But you don't resemble him at all.

593
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:22,722
By the way, 
why didn't you tell us all this time?

594
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:27,602
If you told us sooner, 
we would've paid more attention to you.

595
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,986
Anyway, you said you found something. 
What is it?

596
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:40,406
Right. It's been 20 years, 
but you found something?

597
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,493
Well, I appreciate your concern,

598
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,997
but I'd be more grateful 
if you ordered something.

599
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,751
Hey, order something.

600
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,754
You guys will all drink something, right?

601
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,339
Tangerine tea for me.

602
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,884
What's with you guys?

603
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:02,720
Hey.

604
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:06,599
It's just as you expected.

605
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:09,101
The whole town's stirred up.

606
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:12,355
Really? Is there 
anyone who looks suspicious?

607
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,523
No, no one yet.

608
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:19,278
The guys in the town all gathered 
in the café and asked her questions,

609
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,322
but I think they're just curious.

610
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,492
What about Mr. Park?

611
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:25,993
Wait.

612
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,289
Come to think of it, he's not here.

613
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:31,499
What?

614
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,626
Mr. Park Pil-du isn't here.

615
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:36,170
I haven't seen him today.

616
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,232
CLOSED FOR A FEW DAYS

617
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,942
-Hello, sir. 
-Hey.

618
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:59,527
-Is everything all right? 
-Yes.

619
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,408
-Hello, sir. 
-Hey.

620
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:30,599
So tell me. 
What did you want to say earlier?

621
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:35,187
Two days ago, on my way back 
after walking you home,

622
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,273
I ran into Mr. Park.

623
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:41,610
And he was coming from, of all places,

624
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,362
Snowball's house.

625
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:47,616
I wouldn't think this way if that was all,

626
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:53,998
but all the evidence 
points towards Mr. Park.

627
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,876
So I keep getting suspicious.

628
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:01,339
But the fact that I'm thinking 
this way about him…

629
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,299
I feel so guilty.

630
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:04,967
It might not be him.

631
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,427
What?

632
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:10,639
You shouldn't suspect someone 
just because things seem to add up.

633
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:13,893
Or you might end up 
getting the wrong person.

634
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:15,269
That happened to my dad.

635
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:20,733
It's too early to worry about that. 
Let's wait and see for now.

636
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:24,737
The rumor must've spread 
around the town by now.

637
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,698
And the culprit must've heard it.

638
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,243
Whether Mr. Park is the culprit or not,

639
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,205
we'll find out soon.

640
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:42,922
Just tell me.

641
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:44,256
What?

642
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:47,134
I know you have something to tell me.

643
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:49,845
So stop eating and just say it.

644
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:52,848
You think it's a waste?

645
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:56,602
God, don't be so cheap.

646
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,069
Have you heard about Mi-ran?

647
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:10,866
Have you heard who Mi-ran is?

648
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:12,743
I have.

649
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:13,911
Did you know?

650
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:19,083
-No, not about her. 
-Not about her?

651
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:22,128
Goodness.

652
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,172
She must've thought 
we were so indifferent.

653
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:30,594
For the past three years, 
no one's asked her who she was.

654
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,180
Gosh, I don't know why I was like that.

655
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:39,812
Anyway, do you know anything about it?

656
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:41,772
About what?

657
00:40:45,943 --> 00:40:47,778
Who killed Cheol-yong.

658
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,907
Do you really not know anything about it?

659
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,325
If I did,

660
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,203
you think I would've done nothing?

661
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,621
Right. You're right.

662
00:40:57,705 --> 00:41:01,125
You would've done something. 
You would've beaten the killer up.

663
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,129
But you know, Jin-su's mom said earlier

664
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,798
that the last person 
to see Cheol-yong was Pil-du…

665
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,800
Stop talking nonsense.

666
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:12,970
I'm just saying what I heard. 
What's so wrong about it?

667
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,682
And why is it nonsense?

668
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:20,478
I mean, no one knows exactly 
who Cheol-yong met

669
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:24,273
and what happened to him after he fought 
with Du-sik's dad. My goodness!

670
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,775
You really scared me.

671
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,612
What? Do you need something?

672
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,373
Whether Mr. Park is the culprit or not,

673
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,168
we'll find out soon.

674
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:50,591
He can't be. 
I'm sure Mr. Park is a really good person.

675
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,720
I don't know about others, 
but Mr. Park would…

676
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:59,808
Why is he here?

677
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,185
What?

678
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,771
Shouldn't you say hello to him first?

679
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,774
Oh, right. Hello, sir.

680
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:11,278
By the way, are you sure 
you should be here like this?

681
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,699
What? Shouldn't I be here?

682
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:19,787
Oh, that's not what I meant.

683
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,746
Just go in.

684
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:23,040
So I can drink with him.

685
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:25,709
Okay.

686
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:41,183
Are you home?

687
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,645
Go and eat.

688
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:54,446
Why is he drinking here?

689
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,492
What on earth is going on?

690
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:04,873
God, why is there so much laundry?

691
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,670
What are you doing?

692
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,924
Can't you hear me?

693
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:15,509
-Keep it down. 
-You…

694
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,261
Please, Mom. Just for a minute.

695
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:20,347
What's he doing?

696
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:24,643
What the hell is wrong with him?

697
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:27,354
Why is there so much laundry?

698
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,399
I'll die before I finish it.

699
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:46,582
The whole town seems restless, doesn't it?

700
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,254
So Mi-ran is Cheol-yong's daughter?

701
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,214
Yes, so I heard.

702
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,008
You didn't know either?

703
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,719
No, I didn't know.

704
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:01,972
No wonder

705
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:05,851
I've been feeling uneasy for a few days.

706
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:09,104
This is why you can't live 
with a guilty conscience.

707
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,023
Right?

708
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:14,401
You know as well,

709
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,613
that I did a terrible thing back then.

710
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,826
A terrible thing?

711
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,294
I was drunk, but I did find it odd.

712
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,215
"Why is he going that way 
if not Jun's house?"

713
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,134
"There's only a mountain that way."

714
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:41,804
That did cross my mind.

715
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,977
If I'd stopped him 
and asked where he was going,

716
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,604
would anything have changed?

717
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:56,151
Mr. Park Pil-du?

718
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:02,658
Around 1:15 a.m. on June 4th, 2002,

719
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:04,952
you ran into the late Joo Cheol-yong

720
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:08,122
in front of 20 Juseong-ri, 
Geosan-eup, correct?

721
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,082
Pardon?

722
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,876
-Yes. 
-Does that alley

723
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,504
lead to Mr. Oh Jun's house?

724
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:20,926
It does, but it doesn't 
only lead to Jun's house--

725
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,553
And isn't it true

726
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:26,890
that the late Joo and Oh Jun 
had a big fight that evening?

727
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:30,811
I heard that you saw them fight

728
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,397
and stopped them.

729
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:39,319
Yes, that's true, but…

730
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:42,239
Then when you ran 
into Mr. Joo again at night,

731
00:45:42,322 --> 00:45:43,365
did you talk to him?

732
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:48,120
I jokingly asked 
if he was going to fight Jun again,

733
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:49,204
and he said no.

734
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,623
-But he didn't go back, did he? 
-Sorry?

735
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,127
And at the end of the alley 
is Mr. Oh's house.

736
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,379
Correct?

737
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,887
Yes. I think you're right.

738
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,019
As if I was possessed by a ghost,

739
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:15,397
I kept saying yes 
to the detective's questions.

740
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:20,194
I didn't realize what would happen 
because of what I said.

741
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,945
I was such an idiot.

742
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:28,827
-Pil-du. 
-Once spoken, words can't be taken back.

743
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:33,499
When I realized my mistake, 
there was nothing I could do to fix it.

744
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,669
Ever since then,

745
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:42,299
it's been weighing on my heart.

746
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:45,969
Because of me…

747
00:46:46,053 --> 00:46:50,140
Maybe things ended up this way 
all because of me, so…

748
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:51,725
It's not your fault.

749
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,228
It was just meant to end up that way.

750
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,649
No one would've been able to stop it, 
no matter what they did.

751
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,943
Just think that way.

752
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,075
Right.

753
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,285
I should.

754
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,790
I shouldn't dwell on the past.

755
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,717
Goodness. But you know what?

756
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,011
I can't sleep these days,

757
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:33,350
so I wander around the neighborhood 
for an hour or two late at night.

758
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:35,102
Goodness.

759
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,229
That's why he was there.

760
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:41,233
Pil-du. It really isn't your fault.

761
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:47,030
And Jun thinks so too.

762
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:52,119
Jun told me when he left here.

763
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,373
That he felt like Cheol-yong ended up 
that way because of him.

764
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,918
Because of Jun? What do you mean?

765
00:48:00,502 --> 00:48:03,463
Jun said he thought

766
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:07,676
the one who suggested 
match-fixing to Cheol-yong killed him.

767
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:12,472
After Jun gave Cheol-yong hell that day,

768
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:16,476
Cheol-yong promised to never do it again.

769
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:19,521
Then that happened.

770
00:48:21,356 --> 00:48:25,360
So he thought the match-fixer 
must've taken revenge on Cheol-yong.

771
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:35,912
Just like you,

772
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:40,375
Jun said he felt like it was his fault.

773
00:48:41,918 --> 00:48:42,794
You know,

774
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:46,089
when you're so heavy-hearted,

775
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:50,802
you feel guilty 
even if it's not your fault.

776
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:03,106
So, Pil-du,

777
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,026
you should let it go now.

778
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,789
You know what's so odd?

779
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:21,416
You don't get drunk on days like this.

780
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:35,472
You must be so tired.

781
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:39,059
You should've just gone home. 
Why did you come here?

782
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,144
No, I'm not tired at all.

783
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:42,521
I'm serious.

784
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:46,024
Anyway, did anything happen?

785
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,819
Nothing really.

786
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:52,447
Besides selling a lot today 
thanks to all the curious people.

787
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:53,532
Is that so?

788
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:57,994
Jin-su, you know that book?

789
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:03,792
Gosh, I don't remember 
the title of the book right now.

790
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:07,587
Anyway, the main character 
is a taxi driver.

791
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,840
He usually doesn't get many customers,

792
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:12,718
but he has a lot of customers one day.

793
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,471
But he has to go home early.

794
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:19,099
His wife is sick.

795
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:23,603
And what was it? Was it sundae soup? 
Or ox bone hangover soup.

796
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:27,107
She craved it in the morning 
and asked him to buy some for her.

797
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:33,947
But a customer keeps getting in 
on his way back home.

798
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:36,283
So he gets off work late.

799
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:40,704
He picks up some sundae soup 
and goes home,

800
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,914
but his wife is already…

801
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,921
God, I still don't remember the title.

802
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,549
I should read it later.

803
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:56,261
Anyway, I was just like that today.

804
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:59,347
A customer came in 
when I was about to close.

805
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,641
Over and over again.

806
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:03,393
-It was like that. 
-Excuse me.

807
00:51:04,936 --> 00:51:05,896
Yes, Coach.

808
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:08,732
Yes, I got off.

809
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:10,942
Right now?

810
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,196
Oh, is that so?

811
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,115
Jin-su, I'm okay. You should go.

812
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,077
Okay, sir.

813
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:24,581
I'll go to the office 
and send it to the association.

814
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:26,291
Okay.

815
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:34,299
You know what? You may be quiet, 
but you do make a fuss.

816
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:35,759
What?

817
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:40,555
I mean, when Du-sik told you

818
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:43,683
to keep an eye on me.

819
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,602
I honestly scoffed to myself,

820
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:47,896
thinking she was making such a big deal.

821
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:51,191
But it turns out you're just as fussy.

822
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:53,735
It doesn't hurt to be careful.

823
00:51:55,278 --> 00:51:57,197
Well, I'm not a kid.

824
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:01,952
Hey, why don't you just close the café now 
and go with me?

825
00:52:03,411 --> 00:52:06,790
But it's not time to close yet.

826
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,625
I'm okay, so just go.

827
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,506
Then I'll be really quick.

828
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,174
Okay.

829
00:53:04,556 --> 00:53:07,183
What's with him? 
He won't pick up or read my texts.

830
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,393
What's he doing?

831
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:11,146
I tried to overlook it,

832
00:53:11,229 --> 00:53:14,065
but we can't work 
with someone so unpunctual.

833
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:23,533
Du-sik!

834
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,410
Mr. Park is not the culprit.

835
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:26,828
I'll tell you why later.

836
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:27,787
Is it Baek-du?

837
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:30,248
Look.

838
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:36,379
He was brought up 
by a family full of athletes,

839
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:39,507
so he's very disciplined, as you can see.

840
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,635
That's right.

841
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,888
I knew it. Goodness.

842
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:11,164
Why is he here?

843
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,416
Why? What is it?

844
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:55,792
You scared me.

845
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,169
Are you here for coffee?

846
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:03,508
He can't be in the picture.

847
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:07,554
What are you doing? 
Are you going to tell a scary story?

848
00:55:07,637 --> 00:55:10,098
-I hate scary stories. 
-No, that's not it.

849
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:12,851
As far as I remember,

850
00:55:12,934 --> 00:55:14,894
Seok-hui took this picture.

851
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,312
It was his camera.

852
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,982
So how could he be in the picture?

853
00:55:19,065 --> 00:55:21,192
You must've used the self-timer.

854
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:22,110
No.

855
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:25,155
It was a disposable camera, 
so it didn't have one.

856
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:26,865
No, you must be mistaken.

857
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,847
So this must be how viral marketing works.

858
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:56,394
I sold more coffee today 
than I've sold in the past three years.

859
00:55:57,103 --> 00:56:00,899
Earlier, the guys rushed in all at once, 
so there weren't enough seats…

860
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,534
By the way,

861
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:16,790
didn't you come earlier and have coffee?

862
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,732
-One, two… 
-Wait.

863
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:46,236
Give me the camera. 
I'll take it for you this time.

864
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,278
All right.

865
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:02,585
Excuse me.

866
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:05,713
Mister?

867
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,760
Could take a picture for us?

868
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:26,067
He was there.

869
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:31,906
-What? 
-It was that guy.

870
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:52,760
Mi-ran.

871
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:59,058
What is the evidence you have?

872
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:09,068
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

873
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:38,973
-Mi-ran. 
-Mi-ran!

874
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:39,933
-Du-sik. 
-Yeah?

875
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,226
I can't reach Mi-ran.

876
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,645
I've only seen 
something like this in movies.

877
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:46,731
I didn't know they did 
undercover investigations in real life.

878
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,858
But why come as a ssireum team's manager?

879
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,111
Are you confident 
about the upcoming match?

880
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:55,698
Then I should show 
what I'm made of this time.

881
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,700
You have to come see my match.

882
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:01,079
I'll win the championship that day 
no matter what.

883
00:59:01,162 --> 00:59:03,831
So come and give me your answer that day.

00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:08,461
