1
00:00:36,167 --> 00:00:40,004
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

2
00:00:47,188 --> 00:00:51,776
KIM BAEK-DU, OH DU-SIK IS A GOOFBALL

3
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:53,027
I can't believe this.

4
00:00:53,569 --> 00:00:55,071
What kind of homework is this?

5
00:00:56,113 --> 00:01:00,451
My grandma said you never know
where life will take you.

6
00:01:00,951 --> 00:01:04,330
So how can I possibly know
what I'll be like in 20 years?

7
00:01:05,623 --> 00:01:07,124
Just write whatever you want.

8
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:10,753
It's not like the teacher's going to check
20 years later.

9
00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:13,547
What? Is that so?

10
00:01:17,551 --> 00:01:18,594
Right!

11
00:01:22,765 --> 00:01:24,684
<i>I'll live long without standing out.</i>

12
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:26,394
Done.

13
00:01:28,562 --> 00:01:33,984
"I'll become a great <i>ssireum</i> wrestler
that will go down in history."

14
00:01:34,819 --> 00:01:37,530
Goodness. That's so lame.

15
00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:42,576
Don't look. I'll kill you.

16
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,620
Relax, I won't look.

17
00:01:44,703 --> 00:01:46,580
It's just obvious.

18
00:01:46,664 --> 00:01:48,791
What was it again? <i>24-Hour Scene?</i>

19
00:01:48,874 --> 00:01:51,752
I'm sure you wrote
you'd become a police officer.

20
00:01:51,836 --> 00:01:56,340
<i>I'll have become a cool police officer</i>
<i>like Mi-suk on</i> 24-Hour Scene.

21
00:01:56,424 --> 00:01:57,967
I'm right, aren't I?

22
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,635
You wrote that, right?

23
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:04,348
Look, Du-sik,

24
00:02:04,432 --> 00:02:06,892
it'll be a relief
if you don't become a criminal.

25
00:02:07,435 --> 00:02:10,730
A person like you
becoming a police officer? Dream on.

26
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,612
Darn it!

27
00:02:19,113 --> 00:02:21,115
It's obvious what you wrote too.

28
00:02:21,198 --> 00:02:25,202
I'm sure you wrote that you'll become
a <i>ssireum</i> champion like your dad or…

29
00:02:26,162 --> 00:02:27,162
What?

30
00:02:28,247 --> 00:02:29,290
Hey, what is this?

31
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:30,499
Give it back!

32
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,877
Why did you write such…

33
00:02:33,377 --> 00:02:36,005
Seriously? Is that really your dream?

34
00:02:36,088 --> 00:02:38,716
Yeah, that's my dream.

35
00:02:45,014 --> 00:02:47,057
In 20 years, I want to…

36
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:58,611
EPISODE 12
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

37
00:03:06,744 --> 00:03:07,745
Mi-ran.

38
00:03:11,207 --> 00:03:14,168
What is the evidence you have?

39
00:03:16,045 --> 00:03:17,046
What?

40
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:19,507
You said you had some evidence.

41
00:03:21,592 --> 00:03:22,968
Choi Chil-seong's phone?

42
00:03:29,058 --> 00:03:30,768
So that's what you have.

43
00:03:33,729 --> 00:03:37,149
Damn it. It was nowhere to be seen
when I tried so hard to find it.

44
00:03:37,983 --> 00:03:38,984
Mi-ran, you…

45
00:03:40,778 --> 00:03:42,154
Where did you get it?

46
00:03:43,155 --> 00:03:44,155
Tell me.

47
00:03:48,786 --> 00:03:50,412
Are you sure you have it?

48
00:03:53,082 --> 00:03:56,627
Did you… kill my dad?

49
00:04:04,301 --> 00:04:05,427
Well, I…

50
00:04:06,136 --> 00:04:07,972
I didn't mean to kill him.

51
00:04:08,722 --> 00:04:10,057
It was a mistake.

52
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:17,189
So how could he go back on his word?
It made me mad.

53
00:04:24,572 --> 00:04:26,198
I don't think I can do it.

54
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:27,783
Sorry, Chil-seong.

55
00:04:35,541 --> 00:04:37,543
You suddenly go back on your word?

56
00:04:38,752 --> 00:04:39,962
Are you insane?

57
00:04:40,462 --> 00:04:42,756
Do you know how much money is at stake?

58
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,638
Cheol-yong, this is not that dangerous.

59
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,602
You and I grew up together.

60
00:04:54,685 --> 00:04:57,855
I wouldn't have gotten you involved
if it were dangerous.

61
00:04:58,564 --> 00:04:59,564
Chil-seong.

62
00:05:01,692 --> 00:05:03,319
It isn't because it's dangerous.

63
00:05:05,029 --> 00:05:07,990
I just shouldn't have gotten involved
in the first place.

64
00:05:08,073 --> 00:05:09,199
That little…

65
00:05:09,825 --> 00:05:11,577
Yes, it might make me big money.

66
00:05:13,495 --> 00:05:14,538
But my Mi-ran…

67
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:21,170
I don't think I'll be able
to look Mi-ran in the eye if I do this.

68
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:23,797
So please understand, Chil-seong.

69
00:05:48,197 --> 00:05:49,198
You…

70
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:53,410
You killed him just for that?

71
00:05:53,494 --> 00:05:56,497
Well… No, that's not it. It was…

72
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,624
I told you, it was a mistake.

73
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:03,128
Oh, no.

74
00:06:03,212 --> 00:06:06,674
I guess you could've thought
that it was intentional.

75
00:06:07,758 --> 00:06:08,758
Sorry.

76
00:06:09,843 --> 00:06:10,928
Oh, no.

77
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:14,723
<i>Why?</i>

78
00:06:16,934 --> 00:06:20,187
Why was he there at the time?

79
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,690
What? What did the rice cake guy do?

80
00:06:22,773 --> 00:06:24,066
Back then,

81
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:27,528
he was the guy
who took this picture for us.

82
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,739
<i>I'll take it now.</i>

83
00:06:31,573 --> 00:06:34,368
One, two… You should smile.

84
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:36,327
Three.

85
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,081
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

86
00:06:39,164 --> 00:06:40,416
Sure.

87
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:43,877
Here. By the way,
who uses a film camera these days?

88
00:06:43,961 --> 00:06:45,295
There are digital cameras.

89
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,006
What are you doing, punk? Let's go.

90
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:52,052
<i>He already knew Choi Chil-seong.</i>

91
00:07:01,812 --> 00:07:03,230
It all makes sense!

92
00:07:03,939 --> 00:07:05,107
Mi-ran is at the café?

93
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,734
- Yes.
- Let's go.

94
00:07:06,817 --> 00:07:08,318
What? Wait.

95
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,533
Yu-gyeong, she's not answering.
What do we do?

96
00:07:14,616 --> 00:07:16,785
- Hey.
- You follow us.

97
00:07:16,869 --> 00:07:18,787
- What?
- Follow us!

98
00:07:19,955 --> 00:07:20,955
Okay.

99
00:07:21,957 --> 00:07:24,084
<i>The number you have dialed
is not responding.</i>

100
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,432
Then what about Choi Chil-seong?

101
00:07:39,683 --> 00:07:41,685
Did you kill him too?

102
00:07:46,523 --> 00:07:47,566
Do you want to know?

103
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,193
Do you?

104
00:07:50,736 --> 00:07:51,820
Well…

105
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:04,875
About that…

106
00:08:10,047 --> 00:08:11,090
<i>Chil-seong.</i>

107
00:08:12,591 --> 00:08:15,677
I already have a coach
named Yeon Sang-cheol on board.

108
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:18,305
I knew right away he was one of our kind.

109
00:08:19,014 --> 00:08:20,015
You know,

110
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:23,894
I have a good eye for people like that.

111
00:08:23,977 --> 00:08:24,977
I looked into it,

112
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,774
and it seems he gambles. He has
debts of hundreds of millions of won.

113
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:31,360
So what did I do?

114
00:08:32,611 --> 00:08:33,695
Commission.

115
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:39,451
I told him I'd give him a handsome
commission, and he took the bait.

116
00:08:39,535 --> 00:08:40,577
So, Chil-seong,

117
00:08:40,661 --> 00:08:46,333
why don't you get some rich guys on board
and raise the stakes?

118
00:08:48,502 --> 00:08:49,502
I mean,

119
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,131
I lost my connections,
so I only got small fry...

120
00:08:52,214 --> 00:08:53,882
After what you did to Cheol-yong,

121
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:57,177
I thought you quit all this.

122
00:09:01,598 --> 00:09:02,808
What? Me?

123
00:09:04,143 --> 00:09:05,727
I did quit.

124
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:10,899
Chil-seong, you'd be so surprised
if you knew how honestly I'm living here.

125
00:09:12,151 --> 00:09:13,193
What is it?

126
00:09:13,277 --> 00:09:14,820
Don't tell me

127
00:09:15,571 --> 00:09:19,408
you're still upset over
what I did to your old friend.

128
00:09:20,325 --> 00:09:22,703
But that was really a mistake.

129
00:09:22,786 --> 00:09:25,122
And I've regretted it a lot.

130
00:09:25,622 --> 00:09:27,791
So let's leave
what happened back then behind…

131
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,669
God damn it! This is so annoying!

132
00:09:30,752 --> 00:09:32,129
So annoying!

133
00:09:32,212 --> 00:09:36,466
Why the hell do you keep
bringing up the past?

134
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:40,846
It was a mistake! A mistake!

135
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:44,683
I already told you it was a mistake.

136
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:49,104
Whatever.

137
00:09:50,063 --> 00:09:53,025
I've washed my hands of it,
so you're on your own.

138
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,567
Oh, you were recording.

139
00:10:36,485 --> 00:10:37,736
No wonder.

140
00:10:44,326 --> 00:10:45,702
<i>He was recording.</i>

141
00:10:46,995 --> 00:10:48,622
<i>I mean, it was all in the past.</i>

142
00:11:04,554 --> 00:11:06,306
Die already.

143
00:11:17,693 --> 00:11:18,860
Damn it.

144
00:11:28,203 --> 00:11:29,204
Hey.

145
00:11:31,915 --> 00:11:36,712
So why did you have to provoke me?

146
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:38,922
Why?

147
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,592
You made me make a mistake again.

148
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:45,846
Damn it.

149
00:12:01,653 --> 00:12:02,988
Where is it?

150
00:12:08,285 --> 00:12:09,411
Damn it.

151
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,394
<i>That was so…</i>

152
00:12:35,395 --> 00:12:37,064
Isn't it really crazy?

153
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:42,736
I mean, what the hell
was that dog doing there?

154
00:12:47,699 --> 00:12:49,117
You know,

155
00:12:49,826 --> 00:12:54,539
it was really tough chasing
after that damn dog to find the phone.

156
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:58,001
Right. By the way, that kid…

157
00:12:58,085 --> 00:12:59,628
What was his name? Seok-hui.

158
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:03,799
God, he's such a master at catching dogs.

159
00:13:05,509 --> 00:13:07,427
Every time I let the dog loose,

160
00:13:07,511 --> 00:13:11,389
he shows up out of nowhere,
catches her, and takes her home. God…

161
00:13:13,725 --> 00:13:15,477
I'm so sick of it.

162
00:13:19,272 --> 00:13:24,027
Right. Anyway, you have the phone?

163
00:13:28,615 --> 00:13:29,991
Give it to me.

164
00:13:32,369 --> 00:13:33,411
Give it.

165
00:13:35,789 --> 00:13:36,789
Mi-ran?

166
00:13:40,043 --> 00:13:42,796
The phone! Give it to me.

167
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:44,589
I don't have it.

168
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,303
- Why not?
- The police have it.

169
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,015
It should be all restored by now.

170
00:13:56,059 --> 00:13:57,853
If so, you're done for.

171
00:13:59,062 --> 00:14:03,191
If the recording file is restored,
the whole world will know what you did.

172
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,403
Is that so?

173
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,411
Gosh.

174
00:14:15,036 --> 00:14:16,997
Like father, like daughter.

175
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:20,250
You'll end up just like your dad.

176
00:14:21,418 --> 00:14:22,878
Listen, Mi-ran.

177
00:14:24,254 --> 00:14:28,842
If you keep being like this, I have
no choice but to make a mistake again.

178
00:14:31,344 --> 00:14:35,015
I mean, you guys keep forcing me

179
00:14:36,558 --> 00:14:39,478
to be a bad guy who murders on purpose.

180
00:14:41,396 --> 00:14:42,439
You little…

181
00:15:03,251 --> 00:15:04,586
The rice cake guy? Really?

182
00:15:04,669 --> 00:15:06,129
What? The lights are off.

183
00:15:06,213 --> 00:15:08,465
She would've called us
if she was closing up.

184
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:09,549
Baek-du!

185
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:11,968
Hey, why did you leave Mi-ran alone?

186
00:15:12,052 --> 00:15:13,053
- Du-sik.
- Yeah?

187
00:15:13,136 --> 00:15:14,387
I can't reach Mi-ran.

188
00:15:16,848 --> 00:15:17,933
Hurry up!

189
00:15:23,104 --> 00:15:24,189
What's going on?

190
00:15:24,272 --> 00:15:25,649
Mi-ran.

191
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,108
- Mi-ran.
- There she is.

192
00:15:29,569 --> 00:15:30,570
Are you okay?

193
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:40,163
It was him.

194
00:15:41,915 --> 00:15:43,291
The owner of the rice cake shop.

195
00:16:02,811 --> 00:16:03,853
I'm sorry.

196
00:16:05,063 --> 00:16:07,607
What's going on? What happened?

197
00:16:07,691 --> 00:16:09,609
- What happened?
- Are you okay?

198
00:16:30,922 --> 00:16:32,048
Did you find him?

199
00:16:32,132 --> 00:16:34,551
- No.
- No.

200
00:16:34,634 --> 00:16:35,719
Damn it.

201
00:16:35,802 --> 00:16:37,971
Where did he run to so fast?

202
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:41,516
Let's split up and look for him.

203
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,892
- Okay.
- Okay.

204
00:16:47,731 --> 00:16:48,773
It's me.

205
00:16:49,816 --> 00:16:51,276
I need to put out an APB.

206
00:16:52,193 --> 00:16:53,236
Name, Lee Gyeong-mun.

207
00:16:54,237 --> 00:16:55,322
Forty-six years old.

208
00:16:58,199 --> 00:16:59,242
Okay.

209
00:17:10,795 --> 00:17:12,964
<i>He said it was all his doing.</i>

210
00:17:14,132 --> 00:17:18,303
<i>He said he killed my dad
and Choi Chil-seong.</i>

211
00:17:19,554 --> 00:17:22,015
<i>And that there was
a recording file on the phone.</i>

212
00:17:26,603 --> 00:17:30,106
<i>The real culprit in</i> ssireum <i>wrestler</i>
<i>Joo's murder case in Geosan</i>

213
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:32,567
<i>has finally been revealed after 20 years.</i>

214
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:35,236
<i>The Seoul Violent Crimes Unit</i>

215
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,614
<i>has identified
a man in his forties named Lee</i>

216
00:17:37,697 --> 00:17:41,868
<i>as the culprit in the murder of Joo,</i>
<i>from the Geosan-gun</i> Ssireum <i>Team,</i>

217
00:17:41,951 --> 00:17:45,830
<i>who was found dead
in a mountain in Geosan in June of 2002.</i>

218
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,918
<i>It's been revealed
that Lee also murdered Victim C,</i>

219
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:53,713
<i>who worked with him
in the same crime ring in the past,</i>

220
00:17:53,797 --> 00:17:56,216
<i>and disposed of his body at a reservoir.</i>

221
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:59,552
<i>Lee is still at large,</i>

222
00:17:59,636 --> 00:18:02,263
<i>and the police have put out
a nationwide APB on him.</i>

223
00:18:03,264 --> 00:18:05,975
<i>It may take a while,
but I'll keep my promise.</i>

224
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,269
<i>I'll catch him no matter what.</i>

225
00:18:13,817 --> 00:18:15,068
<i>Next news.</i>

226
00:18:15,151 --> 00:18:18,530
<i>The police recently obtained
a ledger of a match-fixing broker</i>

227
00:18:18,613 --> 00:18:21,408
<i>who ran one of
the biggest illegal gambling websites.</i>

228
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:25,036
<i>And it has revealed names of
over 100 political and financial figures,</i>

229
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,539
<i>which is expected
to cause great repercussions.</i>

230
00:18:27,622 --> 00:18:29,624
…was the key to solving the case.

231
00:18:31,918 --> 00:18:34,462
I've only seen
something like this in movies.

232
00:18:35,922 --> 00:18:38,800
Hey, it's a first for the rest of us too.

233
00:18:38,883 --> 00:18:41,928
I didn't know they did
undercover investigations in real life.

234
00:18:42,011 --> 00:18:42,846
Me neither.

235
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:45,014
But why come as a <i>ssireum</i> team's manager?

236
00:18:45,515 --> 00:18:47,392
The culprit is one of the villagers.

237
00:18:47,475 --> 00:18:50,645
Why didn't she run a chicken store
in the market instead?

238
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:54,649
That's because of the match-fixing
involved with Coach Yeon…

239
00:18:57,902 --> 00:19:00,238
Hey, do you guys know who her father is?

240
00:19:00,864 --> 00:19:02,782
- Who?
- Who is it?

241
00:19:03,283 --> 00:19:04,283
Oh Jun.

242
00:19:04,325 --> 00:19:05,410
- What?
- Oh Jun?

243
00:19:05,493 --> 00:19:06,745
- You don't know?
- Oh Jun?

244
00:19:06,828 --> 00:19:09,330
Kim Tae-baek's rival, Oh Jun.

245
00:19:09,414 --> 00:19:10,832
The Oh Jun we know?

246
00:19:10,915 --> 00:19:12,000
Yeah!

247
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,418
- No way!
- Really?

248
00:19:13,501 --> 00:19:15,295
No wonder.

249
00:19:15,837 --> 00:19:17,505
Remember when she threw me?

250
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:19,090
- You cried all day.
- You flew.

251
00:19:19,174 --> 00:19:20,216
No, I didn't.

252
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:24,971
Anyway, her grip was strangely strong,
you know?

253
00:19:25,054 --> 00:19:28,349
You don't get that strong
if you haven't worked out consistently.

254
00:19:28,433 --> 00:19:30,560
- He's making an excuse.
- No wonder.

255
00:19:30,643 --> 00:19:33,229
- It feels emptier than I thought.
- Why?

256
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:37,233
Why?

257
00:19:38,026 --> 00:19:40,862
Because she was here with us
almost every day.

258
00:19:40,945 --> 00:19:43,406
Is it just me? Don't you guys feel sad?

259
00:19:45,283 --> 00:19:46,576
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

260
00:19:48,328 --> 00:19:50,413
She was here every day at the beginning.

261
00:19:50,497 --> 00:19:52,999
We would've thrown her a farewell party.

262
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,700
<i>Not long after Du-sik went back to Seoul,</i>

263
00:20:28,785 --> 00:20:30,537
<i>it suddenly occurred to me</i>

264
00:20:31,454 --> 00:20:36,125
<i>that maybe the short period of time
she was here</i>

265
00:20:37,043 --> 00:20:39,629
<i>was just a dream.</i>

266
00:20:51,683 --> 00:20:56,312
2023.8.2. OH DU-SIK

267
00:20:58,606 --> 00:21:00,567
<i>Maybe she knew I felt that way.</i>

268
00:21:01,776 --> 00:21:03,319
<i>Du-sik said…</i>

269
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:07,448
<i>it wasn't a dream,</i>

270
00:21:08,241 --> 00:21:11,369
<i>but that our time together
felt like a dream.</i>

271
00:21:13,997 --> 00:21:17,292
DU-SIK

272
00:21:19,794 --> 00:21:20,837
What's with her?

273
00:21:22,005 --> 00:21:25,258
Does she leave her phone at home?
Why won't she reply me?

274
00:21:25,842 --> 00:21:28,177
The soup looks especially delicious today.

275
00:21:28,261 --> 00:21:30,513
- It smells amazing.
- You like the soup?

276
00:21:30,597 --> 00:21:32,015
I love it.

277
00:21:32,098 --> 00:21:33,558
The meeting is today?

278
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:36,769
- Give me a lot of broth.
- Hey, how about you do nothing?

279
00:21:36,853 --> 00:21:38,354
I should help.

280
00:21:38,438 --> 00:21:40,356
But you keep switching the bowls…

281
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,941
The meeting is today?

282
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:43,568
That's no good.

283
00:21:47,447 --> 00:21:48,531
Hey, you're here.

284
00:21:49,032 --> 00:21:50,617
- What are you doing…
- I'll do it.

285
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,951
- Don't.
- You're a guest.

286
00:21:52,035 --> 00:21:53,953
Then why don't you go talk with Dad?

287
00:21:54,037 --> 00:21:55,705
- Should I?
- Yes, go inside.

288
00:21:55,788 --> 00:21:57,123
- What…
- It should be this way.

289
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:04,005
By the way, why didn't you tell me
you were coming?

290
00:22:04,088 --> 00:22:06,215
You came unannounced, so I was surprised.

291
00:22:06,299 --> 00:22:07,926
I didn't come unannounced.

292
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:09,093
You didn't tell me.

293
00:22:09,594 --> 00:22:10,678
During the day,

294
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:13,598
I called your mom
and said I'd come over to eat.

295
00:22:13,681 --> 00:22:16,601
Why did you tell my mom?
You should've told me.

296
00:22:17,143 --> 00:22:18,811
And why did you ignore my texts?

297
00:22:19,354 --> 00:22:20,355
Texts?

298
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:23,358
Oh, right. Earlier, I was…

299
00:22:25,193 --> 00:22:28,363
Anyway, you enjoyed the meal earlier.

300
00:22:28,446 --> 00:22:29,781
Why whine now?

301
00:22:29,864 --> 00:22:31,658
It's not that.

302
00:22:31,741 --> 00:22:34,327
You kept ignoring my texts,

303
00:22:34,410 --> 00:22:39,791
so I was worried that you might
never come back from Seoul.

304
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:43,419
Hey, what are you going to do?

305
00:22:43,503 --> 00:22:44,504
What do you mean?

306
00:22:45,922 --> 00:22:50,551
Once I go back to Seoul,
you won't be able to reach me often.

307
00:22:50,635 --> 00:22:54,472
Are you going to pout
like a kid every time?

308
00:22:55,264 --> 00:22:57,517
Of course not. I won't.

309
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:04,816
Listen. Speaking of which…

310
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:06,651
Hey, about my wish…

311
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:08,819
What?

312
00:23:09,946 --> 00:23:12,740
You promised
to grant me one wish last time.

313
00:23:14,701 --> 00:23:16,577
Can I say my wish now?

314
00:23:18,287 --> 00:23:20,123
What's your wish?

315
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:22,917
About…

316
00:23:25,211 --> 00:23:27,755
About you going back to Seoul…

317
00:23:28,923 --> 00:23:32,635
Gosh. You use that as your wish
now of all times?

318
00:23:32,719 --> 00:23:33,761
- Seriously, I...
- Go.

319
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:36,847
What?

320
00:23:38,558 --> 00:23:40,351
Forget about this place.

321
00:23:41,769 --> 00:23:43,938
Go to Seoul
and finish what you were doing.

322
00:23:46,107 --> 00:23:48,276
Hey, Baek-du.

323
00:23:48,776 --> 00:23:52,697
Of course, I'd honestly like it
much better if you stayed here.

324
00:23:53,656 --> 00:23:56,743
But I know
what you've wanted to do all your life.

325
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:58,828
So,

326
00:23:59,787 --> 00:24:01,289
go to Seoul

327
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:05,001
and become like Mi-suk
just like you always talked about.

328
00:24:16,804 --> 00:24:17,805
Gosh.

329
00:24:21,976 --> 00:24:23,853
You're so cool about it.

330
00:24:25,062 --> 00:24:28,983
I was going to reconsider
if you tried to stop me.

331
00:24:34,489 --> 00:24:36,657
I thought of doing so,

332
00:24:37,325 --> 00:24:39,285
but that…

333
00:24:40,787 --> 00:24:42,038
just wouldn't be right.

334
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:49,295
But you have to come see my match.

335
00:24:50,797 --> 00:24:53,633
I'll win the championship that day
no matter what.

336
00:24:55,343 --> 00:24:59,514
So come and give me your answer that day.

337
00:25:03,017 --> 00:25:04,017
What answer?

338
00:25:06,896 --> 00:25:08,523
I confessed my feelings for you.

339
00:25:09,899 --> 00:25:11,108
Your answer to that.

340
00:25:54,986 --> 00:25:59,490
At first, your mom
opposed to you doing <i>ssireum.</i>

341
00:25:59,574 --> 00:26:00,575
I know.

342
00:26:01,617 --> 00:26:03,536
She still says it often.

343
00:26:04,078 --> 00:26:06,664
But I argued with her

344
00:26:07,665 --> 00:26:10,501
for the first time and won.

345
00:26:12,128 --> 00:26:13,212
In my eyes,

346
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:16,716
you looked more talented
than your brothers.

347
00:26:20,219 --> 00:26:21,762
Don't feel rushed.

348
00:26:22,597 --> 00:26:24,265
Some flowers bloom later.

349
00:26:27,268 --> 00:26:28,269
What was it?

350
00:26:29,437 --> 00:26:32,440
In <i>The Three Little Pigs</i>

351
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,026
and <i>Princess Bari,</i>

352
00:26:35,109 --> 00:26:38,237
it's the third child
that throws the big punch.

353
00:26:45,161 --> 00:26:46,412
Then, Dad,

354
00:26:48,247 --> 00:26:52,293
maybe there's one more child
between me and Han-ra.

355
00:26:58,883 --> 00:27:00,217
All right, then.

356
00:27:01,552 --> 00:27:03,346
I should throw a big punch too.

357
00:27:05,514 --> 00:27:07,516
I have to do it this time.

358
00:27:19,278 --> 00:27:21,530
<i>Let's meet at the gym right now.</i>

359
00:27:22,198 --> 00:27:23,199
At this hour?

360
00:27:36,837 --> 00:27:38,798
He told me to come. Why isn't he here?

361
00:27:42,176 --> 00:27:43,177
Jeez.

362
00:27:50,518 --> 00:27:51,560
Jin-su.

363
00:27:52,853 --> 00:27:55,022
What, are you filming a movie
or something?

364
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:56,816
What are you doing in the dark?

365
00:27:58,859 --> 00:27:59,860
What?

366
00:28:01,821 --> 00:28:03,030
Why did you call me here?

367
00:28:05,074 --> 00:28:06,367
Why did you call me?

368
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:07,910
Are you confident about the match?

369
00:28:08,995 --> 00:28:11,497
Did you call me here to ask me that?

370
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,748
Are you confident?

371
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,085
I'm confident. Why do you ask?

372
00:28:17,795 --> 00:28:19,922
I am confident. So what?

373
00:28:20,006 --> 00:28:22,466
Then how about we have a match?

374
00:28:23,175 --> 00:28:24,175
What?

375
00:28:30,808 --> 00:28:33,894
The third round we left off last time.
Let's do it now.

376
00:28:36,772 --> 00:28:38,566
What? You don't think you can win?

377
00:28:39,233 --> 00:28:41,318
What? How could you and I…

378
00:28:42,028 --> 00:28:44,613
It's not a matter of confidence. It's…

379
00:28:53,622 --> 00:28:55,249
All right. Let's do it.

380
00:28:57,293 --> 00:29:01,047
I say, let's do it. All right?

381
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:06,259
Ready.

382
00:29:07,887 --> 00:29:08,888
Go!

383
00:29:51,722 --> 00:29:52,848
What did I say?

384
00:29:54,141 --> 00:29:55,267
I said I was confident!

385
00:29:57,645 --> 00:30:00,106
It's 2-1. I beat you, okay?

386
00:30:01,732 --> 00:30:03,776
No takebacks.

387
00:30:03,859 --> 00:30:05,569
God, you bastard.

388
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:08,280
You never let me win.

389
00:30:11,033 --> 00:30:12,034
Jeez.

390
00:30:39,311 --> 00:30:40,896
How do you feel?

391
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,523
What's going on?

392
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:43,606
It's Lim Dong-seok.

393
00:30:44,483 --> 00:30:45,526
Gosh.

394
00:30:45,985 --> 00:30:48,654
What is he, the Pied Piper?

395
00:30:49,738 --> 00:30:53,242
By the way, I hear
that bastard's in great shape.

396
00:30:53,325 --> 00:30:55,703
When was he not?

397
00:30:56,579 --> 00:30:58,080
Not like before.

398
00:30:58,164 --> 00:31:01,000
I hear he's training
with guys in <i>Halla</i> class.

399
00:31:01,083 --> 00:31:03,669
- In <i>Halla</i> class?
- I heard something different.

400
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,297
He's competing
in <i>Geumgang</i> class next year.

401
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,548
<i>- Geumgang?</i>
- Seriously?

402
00:31:07,631 --> 00:31:08,716
Goodness.

403
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,719
Then he's saying
he's already dominated <i>Taebaek</i> class?

404
00:31:11,802 --> 00:31:14,180
He is. Am I wrong?

405
00:31:14,889 --> 00:31:20,269
Goodness. Lim Dong-seok
is such an arrogant bastard.

406
00:31:20,352 --> 00:31:23,481
He hasn't dominated it yet.
He's got a long way to go.

407
00:31:25,357 --> 00:31:28,903
To be blunt, he didn't
really beat Baek-du. Am I right?

408
00:31:29,612 --> 00:31:31,113
You're right.

409
00:31:31,197 --> 00:31:33,866
That's true.
And Baek-du sometimes trains with me too.

410
00:31:33,949 --> 00:31:35,159
- Right.
- Come on, Beom-su.

411
00:31:35,242 --> 00:31:37,578
That was more like playing.
It wasn't training.

412
00:31:38,537 --> 00:31:42,458
Anyway, I think it's partially
thanks to his supporters. Am I right?

413
00:31:42,541 --> 00:31:47,963
Look. His fangirls scream his name
so passionately in the stand.

414
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:50,466
It helps him power through.

415
00:31:50,549 --> 00:31:52,259
- You're right.
- I'm not jealous.

416
00:31:52,343 --> 00:31:54,637
Baek-du's fans are just as good.

417
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,222
They're just a different kind.

418
00:31:56,305 --> 00:31:58,807
All the great champions over there…

419
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:01,894
- They didn't come.
- Where?

420
00:32:03,187 --> 00:32:05,105
- Do we do this for the fans?
- Right.

421
00:32:05,189 --> 00:32:06,357
We just do it.

422
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:07,525
Let's just go.

423
00:32:10,236 --> 00:32:12,112
Darn it. It must've broken down.

424
00:32:12,738 --> 00:32:14,073
Will it take long?

425
00:32:14,156 --> 00:32:16,408
I'm sorry. I'll take care of it soon.

426
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,628
- Why aren't they going?
- This is frustrating.

427
00:32:27,711 --> 00:32:30,548
- Look at the time.
- Why is there so much traffic?

428
00:32:30,631 --> 00:32:33,425
A dump truck broke down,
so it'll take some time.

429
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:36,136
- Broke down? Goodness.
- I knew something was wrong.

430
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,846
Let's go and push it out of the way.

431
00:32:38,430 --> 00:32:40,849
Stop talking nonsense. We can't do that.

432
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:42,935
It's downhill, so it's dangerous.

433
00:32:43,018 --> 00:32:44,228
- But still…
- I said no.

434
00:32:44,311 --> 00:32:47,231
HALF-DAY OFF
THE DAY KIM BAEK-DU WINS CHAMPIONSHIP!

435
00:32:53,696 --> 00:32:54,822
Darn it.

436
00:32:57,449 --> 00:32:58,576
Oh, right.

437
00:33:03,747 --> 00:33:05,624
- Captain.
- What?

438
00:33:07,209 --> 00:33:10,879
Today, I have an important occasion...

439
00:33:10,963 --> 00:33:12,089
Captain.

440
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,383
I think we should go to the scene.

441
00:33:21,849 --> 00:33:23,642
<i>Kim Baek-du in the blue</i> satba!

442
00:33:23,726 --> 00:33:26,604
<i>He counters Joo Jin-ho's inner leg skill</i>

443
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:30,691
<i>with an inner leg skill
and breezily advances to the round of 16!</i>

444
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,531
<i>It's 1-0,</i>

445
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:40,034
<i>and the second round
of the round of 16 begins.</i>

446
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:41,117
I'm so nervous.

447
00:33:47,875 --> 00:33:49,335
- Stop fidgeting.
- All right.

448
00:33:50,377 --> 00:33:51,754
<i>Kim Baek-du, Lifting Throw!</i>

449
00:33:54,089 --> 00:33:56,925
<i>Oh, Jung Seung-mo holds out</i>

450
00:33:57,009 --> 00:33:58,927
<i>- and uses Left Knee Hook.</i>
- What?

451
00:33:59,345 --> 00:34:01,096
Did he lose? Did he win?

452
00:34:03,057 --> 00:34:04,516
<i>Oh, Kim Baek-du!</i>

453
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,684
- What?
- What happened?

454
00:34:08,771 --> 00:34:10,773
Just say it already. Come on.

455
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:13,734
<i>He was amazing!</i>

456
00:34:13,817 --> 00:34:17,655
<i>He used his rotational force to dodge
the attack and used Push and Throw.</i>

457
00:34:17,738 --> 00:34:19,406
<i>He advances to the quarterfinals.</i>

458
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,910
Oh, my God! Baek-du!

459
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:34,880
- Kim Baek-du!
- Kim Baek-du!

460
00:34:34,963 --> 00:34:37,841
- Kim Baek-du!
- Kim Baek-du!

461
00:34:43,931 --> 00:34:47,893
INN

462
00:35:02,324 --> 00:35:04,326
<i>What on earth is going on?</i>

463
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:07,579
<i>Kim Baek-du is on fire.</i>

464
00:35:07,663 --> 00:35:10,624
<i>He easily beat his opponents
and advanced to the semifinals.</i>

465
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,043
<i>- He wins by 2-0.</i>
- Yes?

466
00:35:13,127 --> 00:35:14,670
<i>He advances to the finals.</i>

467
00:35:14,753 --> 00:35:15,796
Want a room?

468
00:35:15,879 --> 00:35:17,631
Yes, I'd like a room.

469
00:35:19,675 --> 00:35:21,385
What took you so long?

470
00:35:21,468 --> 00:35:23,137
He's on the second floor.

471
00:35:25,431 --> 00:35:26,473
Follow me.

472
00:35:47,995 --> 00:35:50,956
Could you open the door for a moment?

473
00:35:56,336 --> 00:35:59,173
Could you come out for a moment?

474
00:36:05,095 --> 00:36:06,095
Let's go!

475
00:36:15,314 --> 00:36:17,733
Gosh. Earlier, my shoulder…

476
00:36:17,816 --> 00:36:19,401
Baek-du, you're so cool.

477
00:36:19,485 --> 00:36:21,820
You were great. You were awesome!

478
00:36:26,992 --> 00:36:31,455
THE 27TH SEOAN SSIREUM CHAMPIONSHIPS 2023

479
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,420
God, this is awkward.

480
00:36:39,338 --> 00:36:41,548
Why are you resting here of all places?

481
00:36:43,759 --> 00:36:45,427
I was here first.

482
00:36:46,386 --> 00:36:47,596
Is that so?

483
00:36:49,932 --> 00:36:52,976
Darn it. Is this
the only place to rest? Jeez.

484
00:36:55,354 --> 00:36:56,354
Gosh.

485
00:36:57,815 --> 00:36:58,816
Baek-du, you're good.

486
00:36:59,858 --> 00:37:00,858
What?

487
00:37:01,735 --> 00:37:03,904
I watched all of your matches
from the back.

488
00:37:04,404 --> 00:37:05,405
I got a bit scared.

489
00:37:06,114 --> 00:37:08,617
Hey, are you teasing me or what?

490
00:37:09,535 --> 00:37:11,495
I heard what other guys said earlier.

491
00:37:12,204 --> 00:37:16,208
I heard you'll move up a class next year.
And that you're in great shape.

492
00:37:16,291 --> 00:37:17,501
Well…

493
00:37:18,752 --> 00:37:20,754
So it's true.

494
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,093
Goodness.

495
00:37:29,805 --> 00:37:30,973
Anyway, Dong-seok,

496
00:37:32,307 --> 00:37:35,644
remember what I told you last time?

497
00:37:36,895 --> 00:37:39,523
That I can be really good
if I set my mind on something,

498
00:37:39,606 --> 00:37:40,941
so you should be nervous.

499
00:37:43,318 --> 00:37:46,780
My heart is set today.

500
00:37:49,658 --> 00:37:50,909
Because…

501
00:37:53,328 --> 00:37:57,583
I have to win the championship today.

502
00:38:00,752 --> 00:38:01,753
Is that so?

503
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,975
<i>The 2023 Seoan</i> Ssireum <i>Championships</i>
<i>here at Seoan Arena.</i>

504
00:38:15,058 --> 00:38:18,186
<i>Only the finals for</i> Taebaek <i>class remain.</i>

505
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:21,189
<i>Yes. Kim Baek-du</i>
<i>from Geosan-gun</i> Ssireum <i>Team</i>

506
00:38:21,273 --> 00:38:24,818
<i>and Lim Dong-seok from Seongwon</i>
<i>City Hall </i>Ssireum<i> Team are in the finals.</i>

507
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:28,447
<i>The two faced each other
at the Dano Championships too,</i>

508
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:32,326
<i>and Lim Dong-seok won
after a video review.</i>

509
00:38:32,409 --> 00:38:35,704
<i>Once again, these two meet in the finals.</i>

510
00:38:35,787 --> 00:38:38,040
<i>That's right. The only difference</i>

511
00:38:38,123 --> 00:38:41,543
<i>is that the two were both
on the Geosan-gun Team at the time,</i>

512
00:38:41,627 --> 00:38:45,297
<i>and now, since Lim moved
to the Seongwon City Hall Team,</i>

513
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:47,591
<i>they're on different teams.</i>

514
00:38:47,674 --> 00:38:51,887
<i>But the two were
on the same team for a long time,</i>

515
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:54,806
<i>so they must know each other very well.</i>

516
00:38:55,390 --> 00:38:56,683
<i>That's right.</i>

517
00:39:00,854 --> 00:39:03,231
<i>The blue</i> satba <i>will enter first.</i>

518
00:39:03,315 --> 00:39:05,984
<i>Kim Baek-du</i>
<i>from Geosan-gun</i> Ssireum <i>Team.</i>

519
00:39:06,902 --> 00:39:10,781
<i>He's going
for his first championship title.</i>

520
00:39:10,864 --> 00:39:14,076
<i>He is 32 years old
and 178 cm tall at 78 kg.</i>

521
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:18,455
<i>He finished fourth</i>
<i>at the Namhang</i> Ssireum <i>Championships.</i>

522
00:39:18,538 --> 00:39:21,333
<i>Yes. This wrestler isn't young anymore.</i>

523
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:26,505
<i>But judging by his recent performances,
he seems to be in better shape than ever.</i>

524
00:39:26,588 --> 00:39:29,549
<i>It reminds me of the days</i>
<i>he was called a</i> ssireum <i>prodigy.</i>

525
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:31,927
<i>He's delivering great performances.</i>

526
00:39:33,095 --> 00:39:34,596
<i>Next is the red</i> satba.

527
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,140
<i>Lim Dong-seok</i>
<i>from Seongwon City Hall </i>Ssireum <i>Team.</i>

528
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:41,603
<i>He's the strongest wrestler</i>
<i>in</i> Taebaek <i>class at the moment.</i>

529
00:39:41,687 --> 00:39:45,565
<i>Yes, he's 24 years old,

<i>- He's won nine championship titles.</i>
- This is the last one.

531
00:39:49,111 --> 00:39:51,071
<i>After this match,</i>

532
00:39:51,154 --> 00:39:55,534
<i>will he become a ten-time champion?
We'll find out soon.</i>

533
00:40:06,211 --> 00:40:07,462
Don't be nervous!

534
00:40:12,217 --> 00:40:13,760
Attention, bow!

535
00:40:21,101 --> 00:40:22,102
Knees down.

536
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:27,690
Grab <i>satbas.</i>

537
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:33,655
Hold the <i>satba</i> tight, Baek-du!

538
00:40:35,157 --> 00:40:36,491
Grab the <i>satba</i> tight, Baek-du!

539
00:40:36,575 --> 00:40:37,909
The <i>satba!</i>

540
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:39,911
Grab.

541
00:40:41,621 --> 00:40:42,956
- Okay!
- Lower your body.

542
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,083
Hold the <i>satba</i> tight and lower your body.

543
00:40:46,626 --> 00:40:47,626
Stand up.

544
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:56,470
<i>Kim Baek-du lifts Lim Dong-seok high.</i>

545
00:40:56,553 --> 00:40:58,013
<i>He lifted him easily.</i>

546
00:40:58,096 --> 00:41:00,474
<i>Now, Lim is holding out!</i>

547
00:41:00,557 --> 00:41:03,268
- Push!
- Push!

548
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:07,064
<i>Popliteal Pull!</i>

549
00:41:07,773 --> 00:41:12,694
<i>Yes. Kim Baek-du tried Lifting Throw,
and then Popliteal Pull.</i>

550
00:41:12,778 --> 00:41:14,196
<i>He wins the first round.</i>

551
00:41:14,279 --> 00:41:16,448
<i>- It was so quick.</i>
- Good job!

552
00:41:16,531 --> 00:41:17,616
- <i>That's right.</i>
- Nice!

553
00:41:17,699 --> 00:41:19,576
<i>Lim tried to hold out,</i>

554
00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:23,747
<i>but Kim was so fast
that Lim was a bit taken aback, it seems.</i>

555
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,415
<i>He was incredible.</i>

556
00:41:25,499 --> 00:41:26,792
Good job!

557
00:41:26,875 --> 00:41:30,337
See? You're great.
Why have you been like that all this time?

558
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,964
Don't get too excited.
It was just the first round.

559
00:41:33,048 --> 00:41:34,925
Stay calm, understand?

560
00:41:36,259 --> 00:41:38,261
Yes, he's right. Stay calm.

561
00:41:38,345 --> 00:41:40,639
Stay calm and keep it up.
You're doing well.

562
00:41:40,722 --> 00:41:42,474
Hold out a bit longer. That's it.

563
00:41:42,557 --> 00:41:45,644
You just need to twist a bit more.
And hold out longer.

564
00:41:45,727 --> 00:41:46,728
Good.

565
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:49,397
Let's go!

566
00:41:49,481 --> 00:41:51,191
Go, Baek-du!

567
00:41:53,485 --> 00:41:57,322
<i>Kim Baek-du in the blue</i> satba
<i>is leading 1-0.</i>

568
00:41:57,405 --> 00:41:59,282
<i>The second round begins.</i>

569
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:03,286
- Now, grab the <i>satba.</i>
- Let's go!

570
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:06,206
Baek-du, grab the <i>satba</i> first.
Grab it first!

571
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:10,877
Dong-seok, watch your shoulders!

572
00:42:11,711 --> 00:42:12,963
Good!

573
00:42:13,046 --> 00:42:14,297
Nice!

574
00:42:21,263 --> 00:42:22,305
Left knees up!

575
00:42:23,765 --> 00:42:24,891
- Lower yourself!
- Stand up!

576
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:26,059
Lower!

577
00:42:36,069 --> 00:42:39,990
<i>- Kim lifts Lim for Lifting Throw again.</i>
- Yes, good!

578
00:42:40,073 --> 00:42:42,701
<i>Will he be able to win this one too?</i>

579
00:42:50,584 --> 00:42:52,919
<i>Oh, Front Knee Takedown!</i>

580
00:42:53,503 --> 00:42:55,839
<i>Lim's move was really sharp.</i>

581
00:42:55,922 --> 00:42:59,801
<i>Yes, Lim is second to none
when it comes to strength.</i>

582
00:43:11,938 --> 00:43:14,608
Baek-du, you did well. You did.

583
00:43:14,691 --> 00:43:16,943
But you should
pull his <i>satba</i> closer to you

584
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,154
and utilize your core strength.

585
00:43:19,237 --> 00:43:20,614
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

586
00:43:20,697 --> 00:43:21,781
And focus!

587
00:43:24,659 --> 00:43:26,369
You've got this.

588
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,747
Let's go!

589
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,624
Let's go!

590
00:43:43,094 --> 00:43:44,095
Grab the <i>satba.</i>

591
00:43:46,348 --> 00:43:48,266
Grab the deeper part!

592
00:43:49,768 --> 00:43:51,770
Baek-du, pull the <i>satba</i> closer. Yes!

593
00:43:52,729 --> 00:43:53,730
Good!

594
00:43:55,941 --> 00:43:56,983
Stand up!

595
00:44:00,612 --> 00:44:01,655
Ready.

596
00:44:03,448 --> 00:44:04,532
<i>Lifting Throw!</i>

597
00:44:04,616 --> 00:44:05,909
<i>He's lifted him!</i>

598
00:44:05,992 --> 00:44:07,994
<i>But Kim holds out!</i>

599
00:44:10,914 --> 00:44:13,083
<i>Kim lifts Lim this time.</i>

600
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:16,044
<i>Clenched Interception!</i>

601
00:44:44,072 --> 00:44:47,367
You did well. Don't feel pressured.
You've been doing well.

602
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:50,704
Just push. Pretend to play along
with his attack and counter.

603
00:44:51,454 --> 00:44:53,581
Okay? Focus.

604
00:44:54,416 --> 00:44:55,458
You're doing well.

605
00:44:56,084 --> 00:44:57,961
Grab the <i>satba</i> deeper this time.

606
00:44:58,044 --> 00:44:59,462
And lower your body.

607
00:45:01,756 --> 00:45:02,882
You got this!

608
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:05,969
Do what you're good at.

609
00:45:06,761 --> 00:45:09,973
Don't try to overpower him.
Just do what you're good at.

610
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:16,146
Go, Kim Baek-du!

611
00:45:16,771 --> 00:45:18,064
Go, Kim Baek-du!

612
00:45:20,483 --> 00:45:21,651
Get ready.

613
00:45:28,408 --> 00:45:31,077
<i>Be your old self.</i>

614
00:45:31,161 --> 00:45:34,330
<i>Just wrestle like Kim Baek-du used to.</i>

615
00:45:38,376 --> 00:45:39,419
Grab <i>satbas!</i>

616
00:45:55,226 --> 00:45:56,644
Grab the <i>satba</i> deeper! Deeper!

617
00:45:57,854 --> 00:45:59,689
Fix your shoulders!

618
00:46:01,149 --> 00:46:02,609
Left knees up!

619
00:46:03,151 --> 00:46:04,194
Good.

620
00:46:05,612 --> 00:46:06,780
Stand up!

621
00:46:10,450 --> 00:46:11,618
Ready.

622
00:46:15,622 --> 00:46:17,248
<i>Abdomen Throw! They try to lift!</i>

623
00:46:17,332 --> 00:46:19,125
<i>Who's going to be lifted?</i>

624
00:46:19,209 --> 00:46:20,710
<i>Lim with Clenched Interception!</i>

625
00:46:20,794 --> 00:46:23,004
<i>Oh, Kim lost his grip on the</i> satba!

626
00:46:23,088 --> 00:46:24,089
Hey, the <i>satba…</i>

627
00:46:26,174 --> 00:46:28,343
<i>Now, Lim tries Left Knee Hook.</i>

628
00:46:30,512 --> 00:46:33,223
<i>Oh, Kim counters with Abdomen Throw!</i>

629
00:46:33,306 --> 00:46:34,724
Yes!

630
00:46:40,855 --> 00:46:42,440
KIM BAEK-DU: 2
LIM DONG-SEOK: 2

631
00:46:44,818 --> 00:46:48,196
<i>- There seems to have been an injury.</i>
- What's wrong?

632
00:46:48,738 --> 00:46:49,906
What's wrong with him?

633
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:00,542
<i>Kim Baek-du</i>

634
00:47:00,625 --> 00:47:03,419
<i>walks off looking to be in pain.</i>

635
00:47:05,338 --> 00:47:06,506
Are you hurt?

636
00:47:08,842 --> 00:47:09,842
Will you be okay?

637
00:47:10,844 --> 00:47:12,011
It's the last round.

638
00:47:12,095 --> 00:47:13,721
- Give him some water.
- Baek-du.

639
00:47:14,305 --> 00:47:16,141
It's the last round.

640
00:47:17,433 --> 00:47:20,019
You're almost there.
You can win the title!

641
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:25,942
<i>You have to come see my match.</i>

642
00:47:26,526 --> 00:47:29,988
<i>So come and give me your answer that day.</i>

643
00:47:32,824 --> 00:47:35,702
- Let's go. This is the last one.
- Let's go, Baek-du!

644
00:47:36,828 --> 00:47:38,121
Let's go!

645
00:47:45,378 --> 00:47:47,922
This is the final round. Do your best.

646
00:47:49,424 --> 00:47:50,425
On your knees.

647
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:09,903
Grab <i>satbas!</i>

648
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:15,033
Grab deeper!

649
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:18,286
Don't let him get a good grip!

650
00:48:24,751 --> 00:48:26,169
Don't give him a head start!

651
00:48:31,633 --> 00:48:32,926
Stand up!

652
00:48:41,017 --> 00:48:42,810
<i>Push and Throw! Inner leg!</i>

653
00:48:49,651 --> 00:48:51,986
- Lean to your right!
- Don't lose your grip!

654
00:48:56,032 --> 00:48:58,576
<i>It looks like
it's going to be a long battle.</i>

655
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:00,828
<i>Who's going to attack first?</i>

656
00:49:00,912 --> 00:49:02,830
<i>Let's wait and see.</i>

657
00:49:12,882 --> 00:49:16,177
<i>Kim Baek-du, Suplex!</i>

658
00:49:16,844 --> 00:49:18,805
<i>They touched the sand at the same time.</i>

659
00:49:40,034 --> 00:49:42,662
<i>The referee can't decide the winner.</i>

660
00:49:44,956 --> 00:49:47,542
- We won!
- His waist touched it later!

661
00:49:58,219 --> 00:50:01,973
<i>Now, the 2023 Seoan</i> Ssireum <i>Championships.</i>

662
00:50:02,056 --> 00:50:06,394
<i>Kim Baek-du from the Geosan-gun Team</i>
<i>wins the</i> Taebaek <i>championship title!</i>

00:50:26,664 --> 00:50:29,375
- Kim Baek-du!
- Kim Baek-du!

664
00:50:29,459 --> 00:50:33,838
- Kim Baek-du!
- Kim Baek-du!

665
00:51:24,389 --> 00:51:28,309
<i>Promise me that you'll be a champion
when you grow up.</i>

666
00:51:28,893 --> 00:51:30,269
<i>And when you become a champion,</i>

667
00:51:31,187 --> 00:51:33,106
<i>don't forget to tell people about me.</i>

668
00:51:34,107 --> 00:51:35,108
<i>Okay?</i>

669
00:51:58,214 --> 00:52:03,344
CONGRATULATIONS
KIM BAEK-DU, TAEBAEK CHAMPION

670
00:52:06,305 --> 00:52:08,474
<i>Mr. Kim Baek-du, tell us how you feel.</i>

671
00:52:08,558 --> 00:52:10,810
<i>Du-sik!</i>

672
00:52:12,895 --> 00:52:16,858
<i>I can't believe I'm talking about you
after winning the championship.</i>

673
00:52:19,318 --> 00:52:21,487
<i>Hey, Oh Du-sik.</i>

674
00:52:21,571 --> 00:52:23,114
<i>I kept my promise.</i>

675
00:52:23,197 --> 00:52:26,909
<i>So you have to
keep your promise too, okay?</i>

676
00:52:28,744 --> 00:52:29,871
<i>Are you watching?</i>

677
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:31,956
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

678
00:52:32,582 --> 00:52:34,834
<i>Du-sik, are you watching?</i>

679
00:52:36,043 --> 00:52:38,045
Why is he doing that?

680
00:52:38,129 --> 00:52:39,797
Right? He's embarrassing.

681
00:52:39,881 --> 00:52:43,342
What on earth is he doing on TV?
Everyone's watching.

682
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:45,720
Du-sik must hate it so much.

683
00:52:45,803 --> 00:52:47,305
Not just hate it.

684
00:52:47,388 --> 00:52:52,310
If she watches this, she won't see us
for 20… No, 40 years.

685
00:52:52,393 --> 00:52:54,645
We'll be able to see her when we're 70.

686
00:52:55,605 --> 00:52:56,856
He's taking it too far again.

687
00:52:58,774 --> 00:52:59,774
What?

688
00:53:02,570 --> 00:53:03,571
There they come.

689
00:53:25,218 --> 00:53:28,012
<i>Something urgent came up,
so I can't come to your match.</i>

690
00:53:29,847 --> 00:53:31,641
<i>Just win the championship and wait.</i>

691
00:53:32,975 --> 00:53:34,018
<i>Good luck!</i>

692
00:53:40,024 --> 00:53:41,901
What urgent thing?

693
00:53:43,444 --> 00:53:45,655
I should be her top priority.

694
00:53:47,156 --> 00:53:48,824
I mean, it's only

695
00:53:50,284 --> 00:53:53,329
the day I might win my first championship.

696
00:53:54,413 --> 00:53:55,915
And she promised me.

697
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:47,008
I'm really late, aren't I?

698
00:54:53,389 --> 00:54:57,727
I didn't know I'd feel so empty
after you were gone. I missed you.

699
00:54:57,810 --> 00:55:00,938
Me too. So I went shopping
and bought a lot in Seoul.

700
00:55:01,022 --> 00:55:03,149
But what brought you down here?

701
00:55:03,232 --> 00:55:06,027
I came down for a case
and thought I'd stop by.

702
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:08,237
You come here to investigate from Seoul?

703
00:55:08,321 --> 00:55:09,822
You go everywhere!

704
00:55:09,905 --> 00:55:12,575
Another team could've come instead,

705
00:55:12,658 --> 00:55:15,119
but someone wanted
to catch the culprit herself.

706
00:55:15,202 --> 00:55:16,203
Who?

707
00:55:16,287 --> 00:55:18,122
Yu-gyeong did.

708
00:55:19,999 --> 00:55:22,126
Then did Du-sik come too?

709
00:55:22,209 --> 00:55:25,212
Yes, but she had somewhere to go first,
so I came alone.

710
00:55:28,215 --> 00:55:29,300
Oh, and…

711
00:55:30,134 --> 00:55:33,220
She asked me
to make sure to tell you this.

712
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:36,057
That she kept her promise.

713
00:55:42,813 --> 00:55:44,774
We arrested Lee Gyeong-mun earlier today.

714
00:55:45,816 --> 00:55:47,568
He's being interrogated now.

715
00:55:50,071 --> 00:55:52,073
Wow, that's great.

716
00:55:52,948 --> 00:55:54,283
That's great.

717
00:55:56,077 --> 00:55:57,703
Let's have a drink.

718
00:56:07,171 --> 00:56:09,006
How did you come here?

719
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:12,760
I saw you from the car earlier.

720
00:56:12,843 --> 00:56:16,013
You were headed this way,
so I hurried here.

721
00:56:16,097 --> 00:56:17,223
To surprise you.

722
00:56:17,807 --> 00:56:20,643
Surprise? Who would be surprised
by something like this?

723
00:56:20,726 --> 00:56:22,478
Wait. Your lips!

724
00:56:22,561 --> 00:56:25,856
Hey, what happened to your lips?
Did someone hit you?

725
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,358
Don't worry. It's nothing.

726
00:56:27,441 --> 00:56:29,568
It's not nothing! Hey.

727
00:56:30,236 --> 00:56:32,154
How did it happen? Tell me.

728
00:56:34,031 --> 00:56:37,451
I caught Gyeong-mun today.

729
00:56:38,077 --> 00:56:39,120
Who?

730
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:42,081
The rice cake guy.

731
00:56:42,164 --> 00:56:44,959
He was hiding in Yeongseon.
I arrested him a while ago.

732
00:56:46,252 --> 00:56:51,590
And that's why
I couldn't watch your match today.

733
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,469
Sorry.

734
00:56:55,553 --> 00:56:57,972
Is that important right now?

735
00:56:58,055 --> 00:56:59,724
Your lips…

736
00:56:59,807 --> 00:57:03,352
Hey, it must hurt a lot.
It won't leave a scar, will it?

737
00:57:03,436 --> 00:57:04,437
Can you eat?

738
00:57:04,937 --> 00:57:07,690
Don't laugh. I'm being serious.

739
00:57:10,943 --> 00:57:12,695
Your family must be so happy.

740
00:57:17,575 --> 00:57:19,952
A championship title in my family?

741
00:57:20,035 --> 00:57:21,370
It's nothing new.

742
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:25,416
But it seemed my mom

743
00:57:25,499 --> 00:57:28,377
cried earlier.
It's not that big of a deal.

744
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:33,049
Imagine how much she has worried
about you all this time.

745
00:57:33,132 --> 00:57:35,259
You were a really good son today.

746
00:57:35,968 --> 00:57:37,011
Really?

747
00:57:38,387 --> 00:57:42,058
Gosh, it would've been really nice
if you'd watched me wrestle.

748
00:57:43,267 --> 00:57:46,479
Then you didn't watch
my interview after the match either?

749
00:57:47,354 --> 00:57:48,354
What?

750
00:57:48,397 --> 00:57:50,357
No, I didn't.

751
00:57:50,441 --> 00:57:51,442
Why?

752
00:57:51,525 --> 00:57:56,489
Well, I had an interview with some channel
and talked about you.

753
00:57:56,572 --> 00:57:57,615
Hey.

754
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,993
Why would you talk about me on TV?

755
00:58:01,077 --> 00:58:02,244
I can't believe you.

756
00:58:02,745 --> 00:58:06,499
You told me to tell people about you
if I became a champion.

757
00:58:06,582 --> 00:58:08,250
When?

758
00:58:08,334 --> 00:58:09,794
Don't act like you didn't.

759
00:58:11,295 --> 00:58:14,673
When you left this town
early in the morning, 20 years ago,

760
00:58:15,591 --> 00:58:16,884
you came to me

761
00:58:16,967 --> 00:58:20,221
and told me to tell people about you
if I became a champion.

762
00:58:20,304 --> 00:58:22,973
No, that was just…

763
00:58:23,057 --> 00:58:27,394
"Is there anyone you want to thank?"
"Yes, I want to thank my friend Du-sik."

764
00:58:27,478 --> 00:58:28,979
I meant something like that.

765
00:58:29,063 --> 00:58:32,274
I didn't mean that you should talk
about our promise

766
00:58:32,358 --> 00:58:35,152
on a nationwide channel
the whole country watches!

767
00:58:35,236 --> 00:58:36,695
So you saw it.

768
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:40,116
Hey.

769
00:58:40,991 --> 00:58:42,034
You saw it.

770
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:43,869
You saw it, didn't you?

771
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,832
Yeah! Yes, I did.

772
00:58:48,624 --> 00:58:50,960
What about it? What do you want?

773
00:58:53,379 --> 00:58:55,881
What do I want? I want your answer.

774
00:58:56,590 --> 00:58:57,591
What answer?

775
00:58:57,675 --> 00:59:01,637
To my confession.
You promised to give your answer today.

776
00:59:07,393 --> 00:59:08,393
So?

777
00:59:09,562 --> 00:59:11,063
What's your answer?

778
00:59:17,069 --> 00:59:19,071
Well, I also…

779
00:59:19,697 --> 00:59:24,285
I've also had feelings for you…

780
00:59:24,827 --> 00:59:26,537
What? I can't hear you.

781
00:59:27,496 --> 00:59:28,998
I mean,

782
00:59:30,457 --> 00:59:31,500
I've also

783
00:59:32,877 --> 00:59:35,546
had feelings for you.

784
00:59:35,629 --> 00:59:39,300
What are you saying? Just speak clearly!

785
00:59:41,802 --> 00:59:44,597
I like you too!
I like you! I like you too!

786
00:59:54,064 --> 00:59:58,068
Who in the world
says they like someone so angrily?

787
00:59:59,320 --> 01:00:00,404
Jeez.

788
01:00:08,454 --> 01:00:09,496
Gosh.

789
01:00:10,873 --> 01:00:13,250
Anyway, I must be insane.

790
01:00:14,335 --> 01:00:16,086
Even though you said it like that,

791
01:00:17,213 --> 01:00:18,714
my heart is racing.

792
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:26,222
Kim Baek-du…

793
01:00:30,142 --> 01:00:31,685
I like you a lot.

794
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:44,156
Du-sik, you know what?

795
01:00:46,367 --> 01:00:50,996
Today, I'm the happiest man in the world.

796
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:54,416
Because of you.

797
01:01:29,034 --> 01:01:30,452
<i>But where did they go?</i>

798
01:01:30,536 --> 01:01:32,663
<i>I'm sure the two are together right now.</i>

799
01:01:32,746 --> 01:01:36,250
They were joined at the hip
when we were kids too.

800
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:40,170
Right? What's taking Baek-du so long?
Maybe he's really with her.

801
01:01:40,254 --> 01:01:42,089
Oh, right. Do you remember, Jin-su?

802
01:01:42,172 --> 01:01:45,676
- Remember what?
- The homework we had when we were kids.

803
01:01:45,759 --> 01:01:48,804
"What do you want to become
20 years later?"

804
01:01:49,847 --> 01:01:50,681
I remember.

805
01:01:50,764 --> 01:01:54,435
We've all become what we wrote.

806
01:01:55,102 --> 01:01:56,353
What did you write?

807
01:01:57,062 --> 01:01:59,565
He wanted to become
a great <i>ssireum</i> wrestler.

808
01:01:59,648 --> 01:02:01,608
And Du-sik. Who was that?

809
01:02:02,234 --> 01:02:04,778
The female detective on <i>24-Hour Scene.</i>

810
01:02:05,654 --> 01:02:07,573
Mi-suk? Don't tell me it's Chu Mi-suk.

811
01:02:07,656 --> 01:02:08,866
Yes! I think it was her.

812
01:02:08,949 --> 01:02:10,826
That's our captain.

813
01:02:10,909 --> 01:02:14,163
Du-sik always said
she'd become like Mi-suk.

814
01:02:14,246 --> 01:02:15,664
Wow, what is this?

815
01:02:15,748 --> 01:02:18,667
We've all become what we wrote.
It's amazing.

816
01:02:18,751 --> 01:02:20,419
What did you write?

817
01:02:20,502 --> 01:02:22,755
Me? I wrote

818
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:25,591
I wanted to live long
without standing out.

819
01:02:25,674 --> 01:02:27,509
But I wrote that for fun.

820
01:02:27,593 --> 01:02:29,428
You just need to live long now.

821
01:02:33,390 --> 01:02:35,726
Mi-ran, that was so harsh.

822
01:02:36,435 --> 01:02:37,936
Then what about Baek-du?

823
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:39,938
- What did he write?
- Baek-du?

824
01:02:41,231 --> 01:02:44,193
Strangely enough,
I don't remember what he wrote.

825
01:02:44,276 --> 01:02:46,695
He wrote something really long.

826
01:02:46,779 --> 01:02:47,821
Hey, guys.

827
01:02:47,905 --> 01:02:49,448
There he is. Hey.

828
01:02:49,531 --> 01:02:51,825
- What did you write?
- Write what?

829
01:02:51,909 --> 01:02:53,911
The homework we had when we were kids.

830
01:02:53,994 --> 01:02:56,663
"What do you want to become
20 years later?"

831
01:02:56,747 --> 01:02:58,207
We had to write that.

832
01:02:58,290 --> 01:03:00,292
What? Did we have such homework?

833
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:01,585
- Yeah.
- I don't remember.

834
01:03:02,419 --> 01:03:03,796
Oh, that.

835
01:03:03,879 --> 01:03:05,547
You remember? What did you write?

836
01:03:10,552 --> 01:03:12,513
<i>In 20 years, I want to…</i>

837
01:03:14,765 --> 01:03:15,849
It's a secret.

838
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:18,477
You punk, why is it a secret?

839
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:20,771
Then just tell me this.

840
01:03:20,854 --> 01:03:23,023
Did it come true or not?

841
01:03:23,941 --> 01:03:24,942
It did.

842
01:03:26,151 --> 01:03:27,986
What is it? Just tell us.

843
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,780
- It's a secret!
- Just tell us.

844
01:03:29,863 --> 01:03:31,573
- Tell us.
- Are you drunk?

845
01:03:31,657 --> 01:03:33,158
- Just let it go.
- What happened?

846
01:03:34,326 --> 01:03:38,122
This? I got hurt a little earlier.

847
01:03:38,205 --> 01:03:40,582
No, that's not what I meant. Your lips…

848
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:45,045
There's something
on your lips too, Baek-du.

849
01:03:45,129 --> 01:03:46,839
- What?
- Is that lipstick?

850
01:03:46,922 --> 01:03:48,048
He must be drunk.

851
01:03:48,132 --> 01:03:49,842
- Gosh.
- Hey, this is…

852
01:03:49,925 --> 01:03:52,177
- What? Hey.
- This is…

853
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:55,305
What did you two do?
Don't tell me you kissed.

854
01:03:55,389 --> 01:03:57,266
What? They did. They kissed.

855
01:03:57,349 --> 01:04:00,144
God, after all those fights
they had as kids?

856
01:04:00,227 --> 01:04:03,564
No, they must've developed
feelings for each other while fighting.

857
01:04:03,647 --> 01:04:05,524
They say that happens!

858
01:04:05,607 --> 01:04:06,900
- Seok-hui.
- God.

859
01:04:06,984 --> 01:04:08,235
- Stop.
- They kissed!

860
01:04:08,318 --> 01:04:09,361
- He caught us.
- They did.

861
01:04:09,445 --> 01:04:11,655
- You should stop. Seriously.
- How many times?

862
01:04:11,738 --> 01:04:13,407
- No wonder...
- Hey, Cho Seok-hui!

863
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:14,908
Get over here. You…

864
01:04:14,992 --> 01:04:16,618
Stop it.

865
01:04:18,787 --> 01:04:21,123
<i>In 20 years, I want to…</i>

866
01:04:21,206 --> 01:04:23,125
<i>I want to hang out with Du-sik…</i>

867
01:04:23,208 --> 01:04:27,963
<i>No, with my friends every day,
just like we're doing today.</i>

868
01:04:28,046 --> 01:04:29,506
<i>Forever!</i>

869
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:31,300
Stop it.

870
01:04:50,068 --> 01:04:51,862
<i>Sometimes I thought about how…</i>

871
01:04:54,573 --> 01:04:57,284
<i>even though I was over 30,
before I knew it,</i>

872
01:04:57,826 --> 01:05:01,830
<i>I was still like an 11-year-old kid
on the inside.</i>

873
01:05:03,123 --> 01:05:04,500
You can drink.

874
01:05:05,667 --> 01:05:08,462
Are there any good places in Seoul?

875
01:05:09,546 --> 01:05:13,967
<i>I thought I'd never have
those bright, happy, and shiny days</i>

876
01:05:14,593 --> 01:05:16,720
<i>again in my life,</i>

877
01:05:17,513 --> 01:05:19,139
<i>and I even tried not to recall them.</i>

878
01:05:20,891 --> 01:05:22,476
Let's go have some whale meat.

879
01:05:22,559 --> 01:05:23,810
I know a good place.

01:05:26,396 --> 01:05:27,856
Come on. Hurry up.

882
01:05:30,817 --> 01:05:31,902
- Let's run.
- What?

883
01:05:31,985 --> 01:05:33,028
- Come on.
- Hey!

884
01:05:33,111 --> 01:05:34,905
- Don't follow us!
- What's with them?

885
01:05:34,988 --> 01:05:35,989
Where are you going?

886
01:05:36,073 --> 01:05:37,783
- Where are you going?
- I'm the fastest.

887
01:05:41,411 --> 01:05:42,996
<i>Life is unpredictable.</i>

888
01:05:44,289 --> 01:05:48,085
<i>It turns out that the brightest
and happiest time of my life</i>

- Hey, come over here.
- What?

891
01:05:52,756 --> 01:05:54,299
Hey, let's throw someone in the water.

892
01:05:57,302 --> 01:05:59,429
- Hey, come here for a second.
