1
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:45,962
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

2
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,715
<i>Oh Du-sik.</i>

3
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:51,968
<i>Born in August 23, 1992.</i>

4
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,347
<i>She's the only daughter of Champion Oh Jun</i>

5
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:59,017
<i>who dominated the </i>ssireum<i> scene</i>
<i>in the '80s and '90s.</i>

6
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,228
<i>Du-sik was special in a few ways.</i>

7
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:06,024
- What's that?
- Just hold this for a second.

8
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,902
Why me?

9
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:13,281
<i>She was the leader of the kids</i>
<i>in the village, to begin with.</i>

10
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:16,576
<i>She was known as a frisky, tough kid.</i>

11
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:19,204
- Maybe she caught a lizard.
- A lizard?

12
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,373
- Did you catch a lizard?
- Let me see.

13
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:26,419
<i>Above all, she was fearless.</i>

14
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:37,847
"Let's go to the forest."

15
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,768
"Let's go to the forest,
to pick up pieces of the moon."

16
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:46,731
Poet Yoon Dong-ju
constantly reflected on himself.

17
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:47,899
Pass this on.

18
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,528
He was ashamed
that he wasn't more actively involved

19
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:55,240
in the independence movement
when Korea was under Japanese rule.

20
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,951
His desire for independence

21
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,327
- and self-reflection…
<i>- Hey.</i>

22
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:03,123
<i>You look really ugly in daylight.</i>

23
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,592
<i>And boy, did she have a temper.</i>

24
00:02:14,676 --> 00:02:18,638
<i>All the boys in town</i>
<i>had been beaten by Du-sik at least once.</i>

25
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,647
Come on, Du-sik. Stop.

26
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:35,530
<i>And…</i>

27
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,741
Hey, Kim Baek-du.

28
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,912
You don't want to be beaten by a girl.
That would be humiliating.

29
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:47,208
- Careful. She's good.
- Go, Du-sik!

30
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,418
Du-sik!

31
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:52,505
- Du-sik!
- Du-sik for the win!

32
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:55,383
Let's go, Du-sik!

33
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:58,720
Go, Du-sik!

34
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,891
Go, Du-sik!

35
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:25,997
<i>She was practically</i>
<i>the best </i>ssireum<i> wrestler among us.</i>

36
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:35,465
EPISODE 2
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT OH DU-SIK

37
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,551
You are.

38
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:39,886
You're Oh Du-sik.

39
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,432
{\an8}Is it really you?

40
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:46,893
{\an8}Seriously, Du-sik, how could you…

41
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,938
{\an8}Hey! How could you do this to me?

42
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:52,398
{\an8}I've been waiting for you to reach out!

43
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,151
{\an8}You could've at least left a note
before you left,

44
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:56,402
{\an8}or given me a call!

45
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,613
{\an8}You know my address and phone number.

46
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:01,157
{\an8}You could've reached out to me
if you wanted to!

47
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:03,743
{\an8}How could you cut me off just like that?

48
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:06,120
{\an8}That was just so cold of you.

49
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:11,042
{\an8}Anyway, you came back.
That's what matters, right?

50
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,419
{\an8}Welcome back, Du-sik.

51
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,133
What's the matter, Du-sik?

52
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,179
Come on. What kind of reaction is that?

53
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,973
Aren't you glad to see me again?

54
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,516
Didn't you miss me?

55
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,394
- Look--
- I really missed you.

56
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,899
<i>Du-sik is a girl?</i>

57
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,526
Yes.

58
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:40,238
Why did I think she'd be a man?

59
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,532
I'm sure nobody said Du-sik was a man.

60
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,368
You're right.

61
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:49,330
I guess I thought she'd be a man
because her name is Du-sik.

62
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:53,710
Yes, the name. And most of her stories
are about causing trouble, so…

63
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:54,794
I see.

64
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,381
- So Du-sik was a woman.
- Yes.

65
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:01,759
That's why he was calling out
Du-sik's name so much that day.

66
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,594
- What?
- What?

67
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:04,804
No. Nothing.

68
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:09,809
So what's Du-sik's story?

69
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,729
Come on. Don't be like this.

70
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,106
Is it because I'm not from here?

71
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:19,235
No, that's not it.
I really don't know much about it.

72
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,114
Only Tae-baek, Jun, and Du-sik know
what happened then.

73
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,578
So don't talk about Du-sik elsewhere.

74
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:30,621
Why not?

75
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,624
What happened wasn't anything pleasant.

76
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,712
I'm not her.

77
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:39,172
What did you say, Du-sik?

78
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,592
I said I'm not her.

79
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:43,593
What do you mean?

80
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:47,180
You must be mistaking me for someone else.
I'm not Oh Du-sik.

81
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:52,143
What? Wait. Hold on a second. Hey.

82
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:54,937
You're not Oh Du-sik?

83
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:56,731
Then, who are you?

84
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,444
I mean…

85
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,405
Then, who are you, ma'am?

86
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:05,990
Do I have to tell you?

87
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,743
Could you please leave?

88
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:11,204
This is trespassing, you know.

89
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,121
What?

90
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:17,835
But…

91
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:21,964
I'm sure she's Du-sik.

92
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:25,510
Snowball.

93
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,554
Snowball?

94
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,391
Snowball, where are you?

95
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:42,985
Snowball.

96
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,696
Snowball.

97
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,869
Are you here? Snowball?

98
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,622
Snowball!

99
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,000
Don't you think something's fishy?

100
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,920
What's this smell?

101
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,047
Gosh, that's poop.

102
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,550
- Darn it.
- What the heck?

103
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:09,720
Snowball, that little punk.
She must be hiding here somewhere.

104
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:12,265
I meant the reservoir case.

105
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,725
There are just
too many things off about it.

106
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,436
Gosh, enough already.

107
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:21,482
Rumor has it that his spirit's still
wandering in this world because of you.

108
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,484
If he's still wandering in this world,

109
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:26,696
it must be because he feels so wronged,
not because of me.

110
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,365
Seeing his death being buried like this.

111
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,075
Oh, for goodness' sake.

112
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,994
Seriously, isn't it strange?

113
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:36,247
Why did he die in a town
that had nothing to do with him?

114
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,916
And why drown in the reservoir

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,461
that most of the villagers
don't even know about?

116
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:46,132
Hey, life and death
are in the hands of fate.

117
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,593
There's nothing strange about it.

118
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:51,637
Just be quiet and look for Snowball.

119
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,181
What about the CCTVs?

120
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:57,518
The officers from Seoul collected
all the CCTV footage in town.

121
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,688
Why did they do that?
There's nothing fun to watch there.

122
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:03,816
I'm sure of it.

123
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,403
There's something more to it.
It isn't an accidental death.

124
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:08,529
If so, what?

125
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,157
What can you do about it?

126
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,910
- I'll look into it.
- Unbelievable.

127
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:16,370
Although the CCTV footage is gone,

128
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,789
where there's a will, there's a way.

129
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,792
Don't be stirring up trouble.

130
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:25,546
You see, looking for some
runaway dog like this

131
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,048
is just not my thing…

132
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,760
Snowball!

133
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,930
Snowball!

134
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,766
Snowball!

135
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:41,687
Hey. Go!

136
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,689
- Snowball!
- Hurry!

137
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:46,025
Goodness.

138
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,946
- He's a natural.
- Come on! Get back here!

139
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,031
Snowball!

140
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,450
That house?

141
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:57,036
Hasn't it been vacant for quite a while?

142
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,497
- It has. But apparently…
- Snowball!

143
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,415
someone moved in yesterday evening.

144
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:02,875
Yesterday evening?

145
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,252
- My gosh.
- Goodness. Look.

146
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:05,545
What is it?

147
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,839
Run, Snowball, run!

148
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,426
- The dog is training him.
- Come on.

149
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:13,844
Are you chasing her again?

150
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,721
Gosh, just stop!

151
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:18,891
Hey!

152
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,603
Stop!

153
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:57,555
So which team is this brat going to?

154
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:01,183
I'm not sure.
I hear he's meeting with many people.

155
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,893
He'll choose whoever pays the most.

156
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:05,855
What about Mr. Hong?
Won't he try to keep him?

157
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,149
As if.

158
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,027
He must be enjoying this situation.

159
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:15,990
He's always wanted
to disband that <i>ssireum</i> team.

160
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,993
I'm sure Lim Dong-seok is
the only reason that he hasn't.

161
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,913
Does this mean the <i>ssireum</i> team
might actually be disbanded?

162
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,751
Why don't you meet and talk with Mr. Hong?

163
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,919
It doesn't feel right

164
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,589
to tell him what to do
with the team my son is on…

165
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:33,799
But Baek-du has retired.

166
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:37,720
What? That's what he said.

167
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:41,849
He told everyone that he'd retire
if he didn't win the championship.

168
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,226
Come on.
The judge's call was controversial.

169
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,812
Baek-du was practically the winner.

170
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,982
In any case, he didn't win.
That's just a fact.

171
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:52,401
- Hey!
- What did you just say?

172
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,572
How's Baek-du? Is he doing okay?

173
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,367
He must be pretty upset.
Did he eat anything?

174
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:02,662
Well, he must be devastated.
I'm sure he has no appetite.

175
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,248
Tell him to come over here.

176
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,625
I'll buy him some meat--

177
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:12,713
Baek-du had a feast afterward
and went out early this morning.

178
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,303
You can't hide your identity like that.

179
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,184
Darn it.

180
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:33,275
What are you doing here this early?

181
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,903
Hey, Seok-hui. Could you…

182
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,573
Hey, you smell like poop.

183
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,242
Did you poop your pants?

184
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,619
Tell me what you want and go.

185
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:46,580
I'm so tired from running around,
I can barely stand.

186
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,958
Seok-hui, I just wanted to ask…

187
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,253
You know, that thing…

188
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,796
- You can do--
- Just go.

189
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,549
What? Hey, I was getting to it.

190
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,592
Just get to the point already.

191
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:02,263
You know, that thing you guys do here…

192
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:04,598
Hey, wait.

193
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,059
Background checks.

194
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:10,104
- Can you do that?
- Background checks?

195
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,897
Why, all of a sudden?

196
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,191
Well, it's just…

197
00:12:14,275 --> 00:12:16,610
- Were you scammed?
- No, it's nothing like that.

198
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,196
I knew you would be scammed one day.

199
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,574
- I said that's not it.
- No?

200
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,117
Then, what is it?

201
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,202
Just tell me. Can you do it or not?

202
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,539
No, we can only do it for work purposes.

203
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:32,168
Why, what is it?
Whose background do you want?

204
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:37,882
That woman?

205
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,011
You want me to check if she's Du-sik?

206
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,095
Yeah.

207
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,056
Do I even have to?

208
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,517
I can already tell just by looking at her.

209
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,518
Is that so?

210
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,395
So what do you think?

211
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,773
Are you crazy?
She looks totally different.

212
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,108
What? It's not her?

213
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,444
Did you forget what Du-sik looked like?

214
00:12:58,527 --> 00:12:59,862
She looks just like her.

215
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,198
Jeez, you must've really lost your mind.

216
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:06,410
Hey, Du-sik beat me countless times
for calling her ugly when we were little.

217
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,329
They say we tend to glamorize the past,

218
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,789
but you're almost rewriting memories here.

219
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,667
- So it's not her?
- Of course, it isn't.

220
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:17,338
Just think about it.

221
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,756
If you were Du-sik…

222
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,343
would you like to come back here?

223
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,723
You know what?

224
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,519
Du-sik is uglier in daylight.

225
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,606
Are you sure it's not her?

226
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,116
Go.

227
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,536
Please, just go.

228
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,125
Hello?

229
00:13:56,669 --> 00:13:57,545
Yes.

230
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:02,466
Not yet. Come on, I just arrived.

231
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:06,428
- Gosh, that hits the spot.
- The kimchi is amazing.

232
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,115
Beom-su, put it on our table.

233
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,032
Okay.

234
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,993
Hey, bring the meat already.

235
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,328
Here's your meat.

236
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,875
- Thank you.
- Bring some more.

237
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:43,757
He won't pick up the phone.

238
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:45,384
He said he was busy.

239
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:48,470
Apparently, he met an old friend
and has to check something.

240
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,722
Check what?

241
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,850
By the way, did Dong-seok go
to Seongwon already?

242
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,644
Don't even get me started.

243
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,607
The second the match ended,
he packed up and just left.

244
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,609
He didn't even say bye.

245
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,568
What a cold punk.

246
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:05,029
He really hurt my feelings, you know.

247
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,656
He should've stayed
for at least another year

248
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,158
to repay the coach.

249
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:10,117
- Exactly.
- Right?

250
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,494
He was just some
hopeless high school graduate

251
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,663
until Coach made him thrive here.

252
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,457
Hey, don't be like that.

253
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,209
At the end of the day,
it's all about money.

254
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:20,586
Right. It is.

255
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,338
- You're all so heartless.
- Guys.

256
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,465
Hey, turn the meat over. It's burning.

257
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,176
- I'm good at this, aren't I?
- Here.

258
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:29,929
Hey, guys.

259
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:33,307
The other day,

260
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,725
- I saw--
- Beom-su.

261
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,101
Bring a lot of meat.

262
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,437
This much, okay?

263
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,439
Okay.

264
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,274
It's all-you-can-eat, so don't be shy.

265
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,359
Bring a lot.

266
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,444
- Bring some spring onions too.
- And kimchi.

267
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:46,487
- And salt.
- Okay.

268
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:47,738
Ask if they have salad.

269
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:48,989
- Lots of spring onions.
- Go.

270
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:53,118
By the way, I haven't seen Coach
since the last match.

271
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,079
- Have you?
- No, I haven't.

272
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,705
Me neither. Have you?

273
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,623
No.

274
00:15:58,165 --> 00:15:59,750
What's going on?

275
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:03,170
Wait, could he have followed Dong-seok
to the Seongwon team?

276
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,672
I heard they had no coach.

277
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:05,881
- What?
- No.

278
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,842
I heard that
Kwak Jin-su's filling the spot.

279
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,260
- Kwak Jin-su?
- Jin-su?

280
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,595
From Jin-su's Restaurant?

281
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,892
- Jeez.
- He's good.

282
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:21,897
It's not like I can check
her resident registration. What do I do?

283
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:25,234
Gosh, this is such a headache.

284
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,819
Hey, Kim Baek-du.

285
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,406
Why close the door?

286
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,075
Just go. Don't come to me.

287
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,495
Hey, are you going somewhere?

288
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:38,872
Yes, the team urgently called me.

289
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,709
I see. Have a safe trip, then.

290
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,295
Hey, did you really quit <i>ssireum?</i>

291
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,216
I thought you were just bluffing.

292
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,551
What do you care?

293
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:54,263
What, are you too embarrassed
to go back on your word?

294
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:56,348
Just endure the embarrassment.

295
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:58,726
What are you going to do now
other than <i>ssireum?</i>

296
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,729
It's none of your business.

297
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,314
Hey, Kim Baek-du.

298
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:05,482
What?

299
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:10,237
About the match yesterday…

300
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,364
What about it?

301
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,078
Never mind. Forget it.

302
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,873
What about the match? Just say it.

303
00:17:23,167 --> 00:17:26,378
That punk really has a knack
for getting on my nerves.

304
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,258
He got me all curious now.

305
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:43,854
Was that for me?

306
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,649
What's she doing up there?

307
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,318
Jeez.

308
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:50,861
What a weirdo.

309
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,914
Why is she always carrying that around?

310
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:06,877
I give her six months.

311
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,505
I'm telling you.

312
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:13,092
She'll leave Geosan within six months.

313
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,261
She's got that cold city person's face.

314
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,262
Am I wrong?

315
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:20,808
She does look like she's only lived
in a big city all her life.

316
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:24,228
I'll never be nice
to those people ever again.

317
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,063
- Why?
- Don't you remember?

318
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,482
The newlyweds that moved here

319
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,734
saying farming had always been
their dream.

320
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,028
I remember.

321
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:37,491
I was so nice to them. Remember?

322
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:43,163
Thinking it must be so hard for them
to move down here, completely clueless.

323
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,124
I helped them a lot, you know?

324
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:47,042
- Right.
- Farming, my ass.

325
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:50,045
The only thing they cultivated
was their children.

326
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,005
Then, they fled to Seoul.

327
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:55,050
They did reap a good crop here.

328
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,553
It wasn't just a good crop.

329
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,972
They had a bumper crop.

330
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,516
- A bumper crop.
- Gosh, how naughty.

331
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:05,936
They were just constantly making babies.

332
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,649
Should we ask her
to come to the neighborhood meeting today?

333
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,694
- No, what's the point?
- No way.

334
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,783
Hello.

335
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:27,040
Could you tell me where
the neighborhood meeting takes place?

336
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,919
Try to make it round.

337
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,629
- That's too much.
- What?

338
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:33,922
That's too much.

339
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,216
Is that why it's not round?

340
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,427
What are you wearing? A bib?

341
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,387
What are you doing?

342
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,850
The neighborhood meeting will be here.
Go wash your hands and join us.

343
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,520
- Hey!
- I…

344
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,397
Stop eating.

345
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,983
You're eating two while I make one.

346
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,652
At this rate,
we won't finish within the year.

347
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,781
It's because of you. Remember?
While you and Baek-du ate red ginseng,

348
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,325
I had some bellflower root--

349
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,243
Hey, guys.

350
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,246
Do you remember Du-sik from our childhood?

351
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,789
Du-sik?

352
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,751
- Jun's daughter?
- Yes, her.

353
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:13,670
Are you serious? How can I forget her?

354
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,798
Then, you'd recognize her
if you saw her now, right?

355
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:17,883
Hey.

356
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,928
Du-sik has such an ugly…

357
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,305
I mean, she has unique features.

358
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:26,391
So I'd recognize her the second I saw her.

359
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:27,434
Is that so?

360
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,729
Speaking of which, the other day--

361
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:33,523
Talking about Du-sik reminds me.

362
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:37,277
Did you guys see the woman
who moved in where Du-sik used to live?

363
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,570
Yes.

364
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,696
I hear she's pretty.

365
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,406
- What?
- Are you sure?

366
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:42,407
I'm sure.

367
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,700
Are you really?

368
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,661
- Are you?
- Back off.

369
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,996
The neighborhood meeting today.

370
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,540
Are all the women
in this neighborhood coming?

371
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,504
KIM TAE-BAEK

372
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,839
Hey. You came early.

373
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,424
Hey, you made it.

374
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:02,803
Hi, ladies.

375
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:07,432
Sorry I'm late.

376
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,684
Hey.

377
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,357
I had a large group of customers.

378
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,988
Goodness, look at this feast.

379
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,949
- Help yourself.
- Eat up.

380
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,158
Thanks for cooking.

381
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,910
I hope you'll like the food.

382
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:29,997
What's Baek-du doing here?

383
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:36,962
Thanks for the food.

384
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,006
Enjoy. You can take the leftovers home.

385
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,466
Eat up.

386
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,471
Hey.

387
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:49,516
What's your name?

388
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,560
Me?

389
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:56,523
I'm Oh Yu-gyeong.

390
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,277
Could you speak up?

391
00:22:04,281 --> 00:22:06,950
Oh Yu-gyeong.

392
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,911
- Oh Yu-gyeong?
- Yu-gyeong?

393
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,457
Oh Yu-gyeong.

394
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,625
What did you say?

395
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,547
Why do you ask?

396
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:23,467
Why do you want to know
where her family is from?

397
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:26,803
Hey, Yu-gyeong.

398
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,306
Why did you move here?

399
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,975
Well, I…

400
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:36,313
- Because of work.
- Work? What work do you do?

401
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,607
I'm just…

402
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,443
a civil servant.

403
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,321
Where's your family? Are you married?

404
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,906
Are you here by yourself?

405
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:48,575
Hey.

406
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,286
You're asking personal questions.

407
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:53,163
- Stop it.
- What?

408
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:56,666
We're going to be neighbors.

409
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,211
We can get to know each other slowly.

410
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:01,713
Don't rush it. Okay?

411
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,423
Enough with that.

412
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:08,345
Let me talk about today's meeting agenda.

413
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:12,933
You all know Seongdo-eup,
our neighboring village, right?

414
00:23:13,016 --> 00:23:15,560
I heard someone was hit
by a car there yesterday

415
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,896
and got seriously injured.

416
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,606
There was also the accident

417
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:21,983
that happened here the other day.

418
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,444
- So I--
- Right.

419
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:28,615
I forgot to tell you
this thing about that.

420
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:29,783
- What?
- What is it?

421
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:32,619
About that accident…

422
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:37,541
where some guy drowned
in the reservoir a few days ago.

423
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,294
I hear

424
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,005
someone pushed him intentionally.

425
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:44,923
Hey.

426
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:54,266
GEOSAN-GUN, DEATH ON JUNE 8,
RESERVOIR, MURDER, STAGED SUICIDE

427
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:59,104
No way!

428
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,524
There are no articles.

429
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:03,859
What articles?

430
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:06,903
The reservoir case.
There isn't a single article about it.

431
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,780
This makes no sense.

432
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,157
Are you

433
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,534
possessed by some reservoir ghost
or something?

434
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,328
It's serious.
We need an exorcism right here.

435
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,955
Do you know any shaman?

436
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,708
I actually know a good one
in my hometown, Gangwon--

437
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,752
Don't you get it?
Someone doesn't want the story out.

438
00:24:22,836 --> 00:24:24,629
Maybe because it's just a suicide--

439
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:28,133
Come on. There were even articles
about the rice cake shop owner

440
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,218
running away from home and coming back.

441
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,430
But about this man's death, nothing.
It doesn't make any sense.

442
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,141
I know what this means.

443
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,102
This is a huge case.

444
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:45,108
Looks like Seok-hui was being fussy again.

445
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,201
I guess. I wonder why he did that.

446
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,121
Come on. You know his nickname.

447
00:24:58,205 --> 00:25:00,874
This is why he's called a blockhead.

448
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,460
Right. Blockhead!

449
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,212
- Jeez.
- Don't be like that.

450
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:08,089
Sometimes, he can be really bright.

451
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,717
Once in a blue moon, right?

452
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:15,597
He and Baek-du are friends for a reason.

453
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,684
They're both so silly.

454
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:20,852
How embarrassing.

455
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:26,024
- Mom.
- He just sounded so sure and confident.

456
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,485
So I thought he must be telling the truth.

457
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:31,238
- Gosh, you're so gullible.
- She's right.

458
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:35,116
What about you, Baek-du?
Didn't you feel something strange?

459
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,034
What?

460
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:38,536
I haven't even seen that person.

461
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,580
What are you talking about?

462
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:44,793
You were the last person to see him
at the restaurant that day.

463
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:48,922
- I was?
- He paid to you.

464
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:52,342
The last customer we had
on the day of the school reunion.

465
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,429
Oh, that was him?

466
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,848
Yes, apparently.

467
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,686
So tell me. Did something happen?

468
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,230
No, nothing happened.

469
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:07,607
Is that so?

470
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,568
Whatever.

471
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:13,738
Anyhow, I lost a regular customer.

472
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:14,990
Right.

473
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,284
My restaurant will be on TV again
next week.

474
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:22,831
One of my regular customers is a producer,
so I'm doing them a favor.

475
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,836
It's bothersome, but what can I do?

476
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,300
{\an8}MATCH-FIXING CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION CHART

477
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:41,516
Su-chan, we got
Choi Chil-seong's autopsy report.

478
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,519
But the results are kind of strange.

479
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:45,562
What do you mean?

480
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,399
AUTOPSY REPORT
CHOI CHIL-SEONG

481
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:51,693
{\an8}What?

482
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,737
There were signs of strangulation and--

483
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,989
So it might actually have been a murder.

484
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,786
There's definitely something fishy
about Geosan.

485
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,135
- Jeez, that scared me.
- Why are you following me?

486
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,138
I'm not following. I'm just…

487
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,515
I'm escorting you.

488
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,768
It's really dark here, so…

489
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,312
Well, usually, it's darker than this.

490
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:29,606
You were in front of my house earlier too.

491
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,941
Well, that's…

492
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,819
There were no bad intentions.

493
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:40,533
I just needed an objective perspective
to see…

494
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:44,329
To see if I'm Oh Du-sik or not?

495
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,581
Well…

496
00:27:47,665 --> 00:27:50,168
As I said yesterday,

497
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,212
I'm not her.

498
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:53,421
Okay.

499
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,173
I'm not Oh Du-sik.

500
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,841
Okay.

501
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:02,055
I know. I understand you're not.

502
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:07,227
Seeing how you keep denying it,
and how nobody here recognizes you,

503
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,895
I have to be wrong.

504
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,480
I understand that in my head.

505
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:15,693
But I can't help
but feel like you're Du-sik.

506
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,487
Maybe you are Du-sik.

507
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,159
- What's your deal with Oh Du-sik?
- What?

508
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:28,039
I'm just curious. What is it about her
that makes you go this far?

509
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,791
Du-sik is my friend.

510
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:35,088
Well, she isn't just a friend.
How can I put it?

511
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,757
Well, I guess people call it…

512
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,592
- a soulmate--
- Oh, please.

513
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,638
Du-sik and I are really close friends.

514
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:47,684
Remember the police officer
who was next to me?

515
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,561
His name is Cho Seok-hui.

516
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:54,023
Du-sik used to smack his head all the time
when we were young.

517
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:57,193
He passed the police exam
after three years of preparation,

518
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:59,404
and whenever he was studying for it,

519
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:02,198
he said if Du-sik hadn't
smacked his head so much,

520
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,909
he would've passed the exam already.

521
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:08,496
I mean, Du-sik was one tough kid.

522
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,540
- She was--
- Aren't you a <i>ssireum</i> wrestler?

523
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:14,377
Shouldn't you be training?
Why do you have so much free time?

524
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,547
Right. I've retired, you see.

525
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:19,132
So I have a lot of time.

526
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,634
Retired? You've retired?

527
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:23,928
When?

528
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:25,805
Yesterday.

529
00:29:27,015 --> 00:29:27,849
Why?

530
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,976
Why?

531
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:34,814
Well, I'm not performing well in matches

532
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:38,359
and I'm getting old, so it's about time.

533
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:46,659
Why are you glaring at me like that?

534
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,328
Let's say,

535
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:50,497
hypothetically,

536
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,917
that I am Oh Du-sik.

537
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,586
- Aren't you, though?
- No.

538
00:29:56,669 --> 00:30:00,089
I don't think that's true. You just look…

539
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:03,384
Please go ahead.

540
00:30:05,178 --> 00:30:09,057
If I were Oh Du-sik,

541
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,392
I would've smacked you on the head.

542
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,102
What? My head…

543
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:16,356
Sure, you can quit if you want.

544
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,525
But what about Du-sik?

545
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:22,821
Du-sik, the friend you miss so much,

546
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:26,115
has been rooting for you
from afar, all this time,

547
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:30,036
thinking, "I hope Baek-du will
win the championship this time."

548
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:32,372
"If not this time, next time."

549
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,958
She's been waiting and cheering you on!

550
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,793
So imagine how upset she must be

551
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,962
- to hear you quit for no reason.
- Exactly.

552
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:41,005
You sound just like Du-sik now.

553
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,301
Well, of course,

554
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,847
I'm not Oh Du-sik.

555
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:59,732
And yet you talk exactly like her.

556
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,819
GEOSAN COUNTY OFFICE

557
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,321
What is this?

558
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:08,575
How could they put me,
the sponsor of the games, in the corner,

559
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,035
and put some washed-up ginseng diggers

560
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,539
{\an8}that have nothing to do with the game
in the center?

561
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:15,999
{\an8}Which newspaper is this?

562
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:17,625
{\an8}Come in.

563
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:19,878
All right.

564
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,465
Sir.

565
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,926
Champion Kim Tae-baek is waiting outside.

566
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,720
Who? Kim Tae-baek?

567
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,306
I wasn't expecting his visit.

568
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,391
He'd like to have a quick word with you.

569
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,770
Does he think
he can just come into my office

570
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,689
any time he wants and…

571
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,442
Whatever. Bring him in.

572
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,445
- Wait, Kim.
- Yes, sir.

573
00:31:47,488 --> 00:31:50,825
Could you hear my voice from outside?

574
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,874
- Your father is
- The way she talks…

575
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,959
- really upset, you know.
- It must be her.

576
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,253
About quitting <i>ssireum</i> and…

577
00:32:02,337 --> 00:32:05,089
Should I pull out her hair?

578
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,258
As your father, he's devastated.

579
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,135
But there's nothing to compare it with.

580
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:12,180
Just put yourself in his shoes.

581
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:14,390
She keeps making excuses.

582
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,142
I need something decisive--

583
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:19,604
Mom! Come on!

584
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,940
What are you mumbling on about
when I'm talking?

585
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:26,319
Could you please stop slapping me?
It really hurts.

586
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:29,697
Hey, wait.

587
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,866
Where did all your underpants go?

588
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,785
- Jeez.
- Did your juniors take them?

589
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:36,162
Now I have a handprint. It's so red.

590
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:38,831
If I piled up all the underpants

591
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,959
the men in this family have had stolen,

592
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:43,878
it'd be as tall as the mountain
behind the village.

593
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,422
These people and their superstitions…

594
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,717
Nobody's taken my underpants.

595
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:52,136
Because they don't belong to a champion.

596
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,976
So don't worry.
I bet they're in the gym untouched.

597
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:02,230
Is that so? Good for you.

598
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,482
I'm so proud of you.

599
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:09,362
Then, go on and bring all your stuff
that nobody touched.

600
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:12,824
Fine. I'll go bring them.

601
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,869
Gosh, I need hard evidence
to make her come clean.

602
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,496
But what could it be?

603
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:21,791
She keeps making excuses. Darn it.

604
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:23,668
You little punk!

605
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:25,962
Go bring your stuff now!

606
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,338
I'm going.

607
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,675
How strange. It has to be her.

608
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,679
She has no reason to lie to me.

609
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,723
She's definitely Du-sik.

610
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,196
What a pleasant surprise.
What brings you here today?

611
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,491
I actually wanted to ask you yesterday,
but I forgot.

612
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,118
It's okay.

613
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,746
I'm glad you're here while I'm free.

614
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,752
So I came here

615
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,336
- because--
- Is it

616
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,297
because of the <i>ssireum</i> team?

617
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:14,677
I guess people made you
bell the cat again.

618
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:18,139
Did they ask you to come and stop me

619
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,974
from messing with the team?

620
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:24,520
- No, actually--
- Jeez, these village people seem to have

621
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,482
so many opinions
on what their governor does.

622
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,650
They're exhausting me.

623
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,405
Gosh, what do I do about the <i>ssireum</i> team?

624
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:39,577
I have no idea.

625
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,122
You can't disband it.

626
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:46,334
Geosan needs a <i>ssireum</i> team.

627
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,378
So I must not disband it?

628
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,548
Since Geosan is known for <i>ssireum,</i>

629
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:56,469
no matter how bad the team is doing,
the governor should just shut his mouth

630
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:59,722
and keep funding them?
Is that what you're saying?

631
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,102
- Man-sik, you…
- Is this because of Baek-du?

632
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,814
- What?
- I mean,

633
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,899
once the team is disbanded,

634
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:12,360
Baek-du will have nowhere to go.

635
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:14,195
Wait, no.

636
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:18,866
He said he was going to retire, right?

637
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:22,912
That's actually a clever move.

638
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:27,917
When you hit a wall,
it's better to quit and move on.

639
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:32,046
He should've quit sooner though.

640
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,798
He held on for too long--

641
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,095
Tae-baek.

642
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,849
Don't worry too much.

643
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:47,019
For the time being,

644
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,856
I'll keep the <i>ssireum</i> team.

645
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,902
After all, they're the pride of Geosan.

646
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:14,213
LIM DONG-SEOK WINS CHAMPION TITLE
AT 2023 DANO <i>SSIREUM</i> CHAMPIONSHIPS

647
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,096
- Beom-su.
- Yes.

648
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,599
- Pour the sand when you're done.
- Okay.

649
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:25,558
Do you need help?

650
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,648
Why are there so many of them?

651
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,820
What do I do?

652
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,221
It's empty.

653
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:21,322
GO, KIM BAEK-DU!

654
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,532
IT AIN'T OVER 'TIL IT'S OVER
BY YOGI BERRA

655
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:27,828
GIVE IT YOUR ALL
BEFORE YOU HOPE FOR THE BEST

656
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:33,519
We've gathered here today
to welcome a special guest.

657
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:36,897
The sport committee does have
management staff for the teams,

658
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:39,817
but they are managing
many different sports.

659
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,278
And our governor has been raising concerns

660
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,989
about our team being neglected.

661
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,367
What's going on?

662
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,619
When did they all gather here?

663
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:56,000
So the governor has appointed her
to provide additional care for the team.

664
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,086
She'll be in charge of general affairs,
such as

665
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,132
overall team management, performance
analysis, salaries, and contracts.

666
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,884
Who is it?

667
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,552
Who is this new person?

668
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:09,388
- Please introduce yourself.
- Please.

669
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,562
- What?
- Hello.

670
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:19,565
I'll be the new general manager
of the Geosan-gun <i>Ssireum</i> Team.

671
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,941
I'm Oh Yu-gyeong.

672
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:24,028
I look forward to your cooperation.
Thank you.

673
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,280
Come on. Give her a hand.

674
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,406
Give her a hand.

675
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:29,909
Welcome!

676
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,494
What's Du-sik doing there?

677
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,584
- Governor Hong?
- Yes.

678
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,420
Why would he suddenly
be supportive of the <i>ssireum</i> team?

679
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,172
How would I know?

680
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,423
And I heard

681
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:47,093
that he even appointed someone
for the team.

682
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,011
Some kind of manager, I heard.

683
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:51,597
Manager? Goodness.

684
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,350
Doesn't he always go on
about disbanding the team?

685
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,893
Why appoint a manager now?

686
00:39:55,976 --> 00:40:00,356
You see, people do things
they've never done before

687
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,316
for two reasons only.

688
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,403
When they're about to die

689
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:08,489
or when they've got an ulterior motive.

690
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:23,421
Let me know if you need more food.

691
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:24,380
Enjoy.

692
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:30,719
Let's have a welcome party

693
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:33,806
when both coaches are here.

694
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:35,683
- Okay.
- Shall we go to the office?

695
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,268
- Sure.
- Let's go upstairs.

696
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:39,687
Why can't we have someone
we actually need?

697
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,065
Don't you think?

698
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,234
Now that Lim Dong-seok and Baek-du

699
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,069
have left the team--

700
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,112
Hey.

701
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,239
We have only one wrestler
in the <i>Taebaek</i> class.

702
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,991
And what? We have a manager now?

703
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,910
As for athlete recruitments, we'll soon--

704
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,954
I have something to say about that too.

705
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,373
Don't stop me. I'm just telling the truth.

706
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,042
To analyze the athletes
and talk about contracts,

707
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,128
you have to actually know about <i>ssireum.</i>

708
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,880
Jeong-hun, stop there.

709
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:08,340
If she's Du-sik, she'll smack your head.

710
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,301
He's right. I didn't expect this.

711
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:11,510
He's got a point.

712
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,388
Have you ever watched a <i>ssireum</i> match?

713
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:15,306
Of course not.

714
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:18,350
If she's Du-sik,
she knows nothing but ssireum.

715
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,227
Do you know how to tie a <i>satba?</i>

716
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,021
- Of course not.
- If she's Du-sik,

717
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:24,648
she can tie a <i>satba</i> better
than she can tie her hair.

718
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,859
What do women know about <i>ssireum?</i>

719
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,070
You're in so much trouble now.

720
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:34,366
They're just messing with you.
Please be understanding.

721
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,327
Wait, ma'am.

722
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,163
What? Why is she coming up?

723
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:46,003
- Mr. Yoo Jeong-hun, right?
- Yes.

724
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:50,883
I watched one of your matches
from the last Dano Championships online.

725
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:55,596
The one from the quarterfinals
where Cheongwon's Lee Gang-deuk beat you.

726
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,141
And?

727
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:03,854
When Lee Gang-deuk lost hold of your <i>satba</i>

728
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,023
and his right hand was in the air…

729
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,704
It would've been nice

730
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,041
if you had lifted him up
and thrown him like this.

731
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,795
That's what I thought while watching it.

732
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:31,882
Seriously?

733
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,094
And you say you're not Du-sik?

734
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,224
Thank you.

735
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,517
- Bye.
- Bye.

736
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,189
You were just caught off guard, right?

737
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:31,692
Still, how could you
let your guard down like that?

738
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:32,985
She really surprised me.

739
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:35,362
- She knew what she was doing.
- She's watching.

740
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:37,489
- What…
- What are you doing?

741
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:38,699
{\an8}Get back to training!

742
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,327
{\an8}- Yes, Coach!
- Geosan!

743
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:47,124
Oh, boy.

744
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:50,210
Have you done <i>ssireum</i> before?

745
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,296
Me?

746
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:56,258
The technique you used earlier
was not amateur.

747
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:59,261
I used to wrestle a little
as a kid, for fun.

748
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,513
That was too good to be just for fun.

749
00:44:01,597 --> 00:44:05,351
My goodness. Is there a <i>ssireum</i> wrestler
in your family?

750
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:11,690
By the way, I don't see the coach.

751
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,234
The coach?

752
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,569
Oh, you mean, our coach.

753
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:17,613
Our coach…

754
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,699
He'll be back in a few days.

755
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:24,036
He must be on vacation.

756
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,414
No, I wouldn't call it a vacation.

757
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:30,125
It's more like a sabbatical.

758
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,633
There was a wrestler
by the name of Lim Dong-seok.

759
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,802
He was the coach's favorite wrestler,

760
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,305
but he recently transferred
to another team.

761
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:47,351
He's upset because all the time and effort
he invested in that kid

762
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:50,396
ended up benefiting the other team.

763
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:53,691
So he never came back
after the Dano Championships.

764
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:56,235
Should we call and check in on him?

765
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,904
I already did, of course.

766
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,364
I did,

767
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:04,118
<i>but since that championship ended,</i>

768
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,994
<i>he hasn't answered my calls.</i>

769
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:29,518
COACH PARK

770
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:41,822
"You must be mistaking me
for someone else"?

771
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,615
"I'm not Oh Du-sik"?

772
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:45,534
Are you kidding me?

773
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:48,078
How do you know such an advanced technique

774
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,872
if you're not Oh Du-sik?

775
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,585
What a liar.

776
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,045
Darn it.

777
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:12,936
<i>When you hit a wall,</i>
<i>it's better to quit and move on.</i>

778
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:16,190
<i>He should've quit sooner though.</i>

779
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:18,484
<i>He held on for too long.</i>

780
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:23,822
Hi, Dad.

781
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,658
What are you doing out here?

782
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,578
Where have you been?

783
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:32,289
I went to the gym to pick up my stuff

784
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:33,790
and my underpants…

785
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:36,335
Mom told me to.

786
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:41,048
Follow me.

787
00:46:42,174 --> 00:46:43,050
What?

788
00:46:44,176 --> 00:46:46,011
Where are we going?

789
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,555
Dad, where are we going?

790
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:53,018
Come on, Dad. What's the matter?

00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:11,119

00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:39,273

{\an8}Jeez.

800
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:56,123
Look at you, grinning from ear to ear.

801
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,917
What are you so happy about?

802
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:07,092
{\an8}You and your darn junior champion title.

803
00:48:19,646 --> 00:48:23,358
What happened
to the <i>ssireum</i> prodigy, Kim Baek-du?

804
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:39,458
What's that?

805
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:56,266
Dad.

806
00:48:56,933 --> 00:48:58,894
Why are we here at this hour?

807
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,730
What are you trying to do?

808
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:04,107
Dad!

809
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:07,903
Answer me.

810
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,112
Why?

811
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:14,868
Get in position.

812
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,704
- What?
- Now.

813
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,375
I heard you're quitting <i>ssireum.</i>

814
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:25,295
Have a match with me before you quit.

815
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:28,256
I'll see how you do

816
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:31,468
and tell you
whether you should quit or not.

817
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:35,639
Grab my <i>satba.</i>

818
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,309
Now!

819
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,332
That's how you'd hold it?

820
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,500
Yes, I'm ready.

821
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:13,301
Darn it.

822
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:16,471
Get up.

823
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:18,056
Grab it again.

824
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,935
You weren't taking it seriously.

825
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:25,897
I can't evaluate your skills like this.

826
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:28,775
Get up!

827
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:31,528
Darn it.

828
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:51,214
Are you holding it correctly this time?

829
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:52,424
Yes, I am.

830
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:11,193
Stand up.

831
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,402
Grab it again.

832
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:40,514
Stand up.

833
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:43,350
Stand up.

834
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:06,915
Stand up. Grab it again.

835
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:12,379
I said, stand up.

836
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:14,005
Stand up!

837
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:19,636
Aren't you upset?

838
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:24,850
After all this time
you've trained on the sand,

839
00:52:25,684 --> 00:52:27,477
shouldn't you be upset?

840
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,731
Don't you feel like

841
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:35,527
you want to keep pushing
and prove them wrong?

842
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:42,284
- Kim Baek-du!
- What if it still doesn't work out?

843
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:45,078
What?

844
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:48,456
What if I can't prove anything…

845
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:54,212
after I keep pushing?

846
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,006
What do I do then?

847
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:01,219
Dad.

848
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:03,597
You know what?

849
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,058
When I said I'd quit <i>ssireum,</i>

850
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,477
nobody stopped me.

851
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,942
To be honest, at first,

852
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:21,656
I thought I'd fake it for a few days

853
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:28,121
and then go back
if someone tried to stop me.

854
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,665
A part of me thought I'd do that.

855
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,377
But…

856
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,422
nobody stopped me.

857
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:45,764
Then, after a couple days passed by,

858
00:53:46,556 --> 00:53:48,099
I felt like

859
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:50,936
I couldn't go back,

860
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:53,939
even if they wanted me to.

861
00:53:57,025 --> 00:53:59,986
I realized, to them,

862
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:04,282
that's all I was worth.

863
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:12,040
I'm sorry, Dad.

864
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,503
I'm the only one who didn't win.

865
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,674
I'm the only one

866
00:54:21,925 --> 00:54:24,636
who ended up a pathetic loser.

867
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,974
I'm so sorry, Dad.

868
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,353
I mean it.

869
00:54:36,731 --> 00:54:38,692
You damn brat.

870
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,595
Damn it.

871
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,444
That fool.

872
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,472
What are you doing there?

873
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:37,519
What are you doing lying there?

874
00:56:38,853 --> 00:56:40,522
Should I call someone?

875
00:56:40,605 --> 00:56:43,066
- I'm the manager of--
- I know.

876
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:46,402
I'll leave soon,

877
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,447
so don't mind me and just go.

878
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,200
Today,

879
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:56,246
I really need some alone time.

880
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:03,480
Hey!

881
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:08,443
"Hey"?

882
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:10,570
That's right. Hey.

883
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,409
I was right.

884
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:19,078
You're Du-sik.

885
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:23,249
Too bad, though.

886
00:58:23,917 --> 00:58:26,127
I'm really happy to see you,

887
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:29,631
but right now,
I'm not in the mood to talk.

888
00:58:30,798 --> 00:58:33,510
So please, just leave me--

889
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,970
You're being ridiculous.

890
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:38,806
What?

891
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,769
Thanks to you,
all my plans will be ruined.

892
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:46,523
What? Why?

893
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:47,649
What did I do?

894
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:50,693
Since when did you have such a sharp eye?

895
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,196
Since when were you so observant?

896
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:55,782
Why would you insist I'm Du-sik
when everyone else--

897
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:57,492
Because you are Du-sik!

898
00:58:58,910 --> 00:58:59,869
I'm not.

899
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:02,914
How many times did I say I wasn't?

900
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:08,336
Don't you think there must be
a good reason why I keep denying it?

901
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:10,755
Also,

902
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:13,424
why did you quit <i>ssireum?</i>

903
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:20,223
Seeing you quit <i>ssireum</i> and lying here
makes me worry.

904
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:22,392
Hold on. So…

905
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,353
are you Du-sik or not?

906
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:27,230
What?

907
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:31,484
Are you Du-sik or not? Answer me.

908
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:34,988
Are you Du-sik or not?

909
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,703
I…

910
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:46,916
Oh Du-sik is…

911
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:48,626
Honey.

912
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:01,097
"Honey"?

913
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:03,808
You were here?

914
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,066
I've been looking for you.

915
01:00:17,488 --> 01:00:20,033
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

916
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:46,225
{\an8}<i>"Honey"? You're married?</i>

917
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,268
{\an8}<i>Du-sik is married?</i>

918
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:48,978
{\an8}Hello, ladies.

919
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:50,980
{\an8}You're the one who moved
to Du-sik's house.

920
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:51,939
{\an8}Du-sik?

921
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,525
{\an8}<i>I saw the guys heading somewhere earlier.</i>

922
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:56,736
{\an8}<i>Did something happen</i>
<i>to the </i>ssireum<i> team again?</i>

923
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,404
{\an8}Was Du-sik your first love?

924
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:02,450
{\an8}<i>If not, why did you call her name</i>
<i>so desperately the other day?</i>

925
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:04,118
{\an8}We've got a new coach.

926
01:01:04,202 --> 01:01:07,205
{\an8}<i>Actually, there's someone</i>
<i>I wanted to recommend.</i>

927
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:10,375
<i>What is Du-sik up to?</i>

928
01:01:12,585 --> 01:01:14,587
