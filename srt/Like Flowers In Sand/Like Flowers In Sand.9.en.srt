2
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:52,385
The curtains have come down

3
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:57,182
on the 31-day global fiesta, 
that is the 2002 Korea-Japan World Cup.

4
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,853
Our shared journey 
of this emotional roller coaster

5
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:05,607
already feels 
like a midsummer night's dream,

6
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:10,862
but it's time to treasure this happy, 
unforgettable memory as a keepsake

7
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:14,699
and return to reality.

8
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,829
Now, today's first song.

9
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,873
"A Midsummer Night's Dream."

10
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:55,907
OH DU-SIK

11
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:09,003
Promise me that you'll be a champion 
when you grow up.

12
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:14,050
And when you become a champion, 
don't forget to tell people about me.

13
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:15,718
Okay?

14
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,097
Du-sik, wait!

15
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:22,016
Where are you going?

16
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,144
Oh Du-sik!

17
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:38,366
OH DU-SIK, KIM BAEK-DU 02 05 30

18
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:45,373
EPISODE 9 
ALL THAT WE HAVE LOST

19
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,388
I thought I had to investigate myself.

20
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,391
People are funny.

21
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,270
They used to be 
so eager to know the truth,

22
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,481
but after some time, 
they couldn't care less.

23
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,776
But that's just not fair.

24
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,112
For both me and my dad.

25
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,532
That's why I came back.

26
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,160
Just like you did, right?

27
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:23,870
Am I wrong?

28
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:35,173
So did you find anything?

29
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:43,681
Back then, 
everyone said Jun was the culprit.

30
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,060
But I didn't think so.

31
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,105
Choi Chil-seong.

32
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,860
After he came to Geosan,

33
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:59,614
match-fixing and illegal gambling 
started happening.

34
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,160
So I thought he must be the one 
who harmed my dad.

35
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,832
I don't know how he knew,

36
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:14,337
but he started coming to my café 
about two months ago.

37
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:20,260
He'd always sit in the same spot,

38
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,179
have some coffee, and leave.

39
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:26,557
Then one day…

40
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,157
Enjoy.

41
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,368
Joo Cheol-yong.

42
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,251
What happened to Cheol-yong

43
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,503
is my fault.

44
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,219
Technically, I killed him.

45
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,724
He knew who I was.

46
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,522
He came because he knew me.

47
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:20,486
But what do you think he meant by,

48
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,282
"Technically, I killed him"?

49
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:27,744
I had to know the answer.

50
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,496
So I went with him.

51
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,834
What does that mean?

52
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,963
What do you mean 
that you technically killed him?

53
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:41,716
I shouldn't have dragged 
Cheol-yong into it.

54
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,343
It was my fault.

55
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,013
You can't be here either.

56
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,057
You've got to leave this town.

57
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,725
What are you talking about?

58
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,560
The person who killed your dad…

59
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,355
is in this town.

60
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,555
What? Sir.

61
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,558
Wait, sir.

62
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,144
Wait. Take this.

63
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:38,523
Take this 40,000 won.

64
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,984
Sir.

65
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,904
It's your money. Come on. Take it.

66
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,661
Wait.

67
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:54,539
You need to take this 40,000 won.

68
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:56,374
-Keeping this… 
-Then, unfortunately…

69
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:57,834
It would make me feel guilty.

70
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,920
We ran into some drunkard.

71
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:04,841
Why are you looking at me?

72
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,884
Are you talking about me?

73
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:10,012
You kept insisting 
he should take 40,000 won…

74
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:13,975
No, I don't think 
you have to talk about that here.

75
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,310
Did Choi Chil-seong really say

76
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,732
that the person 
who harmed your dad was here?

77
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,821
His phone kept ringing.

78
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,766
He kept ignoring it, 
but in the end, he picked up.

79
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:57,810
And it seemed

80
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,898
that he was arguing with someone.

81
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,984
I couldn't hear it though. 
He was far away.

82
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,128
Let's meet here.

83
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,965
What do you mean? You didn't tell me any--

84
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,008
Come here tomorrow.

85
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,344
Then I'll tell you everything.

86
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,387
62-9 BUKNAM-DONG 
ROOM 304, ROSE INN

87
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,808
Everything you want to know 
and have to know.

88
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:43,147
So just leave for now.

89
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,662
That was it.

90
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:04,168
When I woke up the next morning, 
the whole neighborhood was in shock.

91
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,047
Apparently, a car was towed 
out of the reservoir,

92
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:12,009
and there was a body inside.

93
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,555
That was the end.

94
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,641
I'm one unlucky girl.

95
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:21,644
Wait.

96
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,064
What about the plan to meet again?

97
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,035
He said to meet him there.

98
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:41,330
Rose Inn in Buknam-dong?

99
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,334
It seemed that he was staying there 
before he died.

100
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:49,755
He said if I went there, 
he'd tell me everything he knew

101
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,382
and give me something.

102
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,385
I think this was it.

103
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:57,555
It was in the middle of the empty room.

104
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,892
Wait. Let me open it.

105
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,192
Hey.

106
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,361
It's money.

107
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,906
Did he want to give it to me?

108
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,700
Jeez, how much is that?

109
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,704
Well, it doesn't matter, does it?

110
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:27,835
All I wanted was to find out 
who killed my dad and why.

111
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,004
That's all I needed to know.

112
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,844
Anyway, that's all I know.

113
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,223
Now, I'll trust you and wait.

114
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,351
Because you're a cop.

115
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,652
Hey.

116
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,405
She knows everything.

117
00:10:58,616 --> 00:11:00,618
I appreciate that she told us all this,

118
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,204
but I still don't get what it means.

119
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,498
Do you get it?

120
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,791
I do.

121
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,001
And you should too.

122
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:10,503
What?

123
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:13,798
Do you still not recognize her?

124
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,759
No. Who is she?

125
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,894
It's her.

126
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:29,563
JOO CHEOL-YONG

127
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,482
Uncle Cheol-yong's daughter.

128
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:35,694
Joo Mi-ran.

129
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,571
What?

130
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:45,496
Du-sik, did you really come back 
to Geosan because of that?

131
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:48,666
Is that it?

132
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:55,881
I thought you wouldn't want to think 
about what happened then.

133
00:11:58,843 --> 00:11:59,718
Hey.

134
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,514
I was cleaning the house a few days ago

135
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,016
and found my old diary.

136
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:10,813
And all I wrote about there was playing.

137
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,233
Apparently, I was 
all about playing around then.

138
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,611
One day,

139
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,448
I went to the mountains with you guys

140
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:23,200
and played there until the sun went down.

141
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,994
I had such a blast

142
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,872
that I wrote this 
at the bottom of the page.

143
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,125
"I wish

144
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:36,422
this moment would last forever."

145
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,511
Maybe that jinxed it.

146
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,389
Soon after, everything fell apart.

147
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,980
By the way, did you really not recognize 
Mi-ran in the past three years?

148
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,610
Hey, Kim Baek-du.

149
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:59,945
Yeah? What?

150
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:04,033
Did you really not know 
Mi-ran was Uncle Cheol-yong's daughter?

151
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,203
Right. Mi-ran.

152
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:09,997
No, I really didn't know.

153
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,209
You know the show, The Masked Singer?

154
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:17,421
On that show, 
people don't recognize the contestants

155
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,672
by their voices.

156
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,883
But do you know what's more embarrassing?

157
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:24,094
Even after they take off their masks,

158
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,430
some people still don't recognize them.

159
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,474
That's how I feel right now.

160
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:35,689
Uncle Cheol-yong's daughter, Joo Mi-ran…

161
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,443
Du-sik.

162
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:46,534
To be honest, if I were her, 
I would've just taken the money.

163
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,416
I mean, objectively speaking…

164
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,044
Realistically,

165
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:59,338
it's good to get some compensation.

166
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,840
You think that's going 
to compensate for everything?

167
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:11,767
No amount of money would make up for it.

168
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,691
Think about what she lost.

169
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,004
Though I can't speak for her,

170
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:44,592
she's probably felt like 
one foot was stuck in mud all her life.

171
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,971
No matter how hard she tried, 
she couldn't get out.

172
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:53,642
And nobody came to help her out.

173
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:59,398
Imagine living stuck like that 
all your life.

174
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,611
No money can comfort someone who--

175
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,945
Was that how you felt?

176
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:06,697
What?

177
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,574
Have you felt

178
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,620
stuck in the mud like that, 
since you left this place?

179
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,079
Me?

180
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,127
For me, there have been ups and downs.

181
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,255
One day,

182
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,926
anything related to ssireum and Geosan 
would make me shake with anger,

183
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:29,428
and the next,

184
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,392
thinking about my life here 
would bring a smile to my face.

185
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:41,190
I keep trying to deny it,

186
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:46,612
but I guess my childhood here as Oh Du-sik 
must've been the happiest time of my life.

187
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,911
Oh, well. You wouldn't understand.

188
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:59,541
You haven't lost anything in life, 
so you wouldn't understand what it's like.

189
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,459
What?

190
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,170
What do you mean, I haven't lost anything?

191
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,088
What is it?

192
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,215
What is it that you've lost?

193
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,594
-Many things and-- 
-So tell me.

194
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,513
Many things and what?

195
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,141
Well…

196
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,322
I've lost something too.

197
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:33,617
Because of her, I…

198
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,955
I…

199
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,470
That was the wind.

200
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,689
Go wash up and eat.

201
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,190
Okay.

202
00:17:18,287 --> 00:17:19,121
Dad.

203
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,914
What?

204
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:23,292
Back then,

205
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:28,922
we shouldn't have let 
Du-sik's family leave like that.

206
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:36,305
We should have done whatever we could

207
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:40,017
to make them stay here.

208
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,771
Then…

209
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,767
I know they're twins,

210
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,645
but how could they place 197th and 198th?

211
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,564
They did a pretty good job.

212
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:12,901
Babe, these days, they don't have 
500 to 600 students at school

213
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,111
like in the old days.

214
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,864
They have a little more than 200 students.

215
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:20,033
Really? Then their grades are almost 
the lowest in school.

216
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:23,287
Jeez, their parents must be so worried.

217
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:27,916
Their mom is actually thinking 
of asking Uk to tutor them.

218
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,042
Yeong-uk?

219
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:33,046
If he had taken the same exam, 
he would've placed 199th.

220
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:37,676
No, not that Uk. Hyeon-uk.

221
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:41,096
Remember the new general manager 
of the ssireum team?

222
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,473
-Her husband. 
-I see.

223
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,018
He's unemployed at the moment,

224
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,062
but apparently, he was 
a pretty smart kid back in school.

225
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,357
No wonder he sounds quite knowledgeable

226
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,443
when he speaks.

227
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:06,538
Well, that smart man has no idea 
what his wife is up to, though.

228
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:11,710
What do you mean?

229
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,629
What?

230
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:17,299
You seem to have some juicy gossip.

231
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,427
-What? 
-Do you?

232
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:25,766
I think this could be 
a bit dangerous to share.

233
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,605
Do you remember what I said the other day?

234
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,106
At the terminal, Baek-du--

235
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,901
He was happily chatting with some girl.

236
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,403
You never forget 
those kinds of stories, do you?

237
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,571
What about it?

238
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:44,201
Actually…

239
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:48,038
-I think I saw the girl's face. 
-Really?

240
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:50,582
And I think she is…

241
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:54,127
That's what I think.

242
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,714
-Baek-du and her? 
-Yes.

243
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,174
Oh, my gosh.

244
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:10,269
Well, that came out of nowhere.

245
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,230
I guess this is it.

246
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:17,109
Anyway, we can go back 
to Seoul now. Right?

247
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:26,368
I can't believe she hasn't told me 
this important information all this time.

248
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,955
She impresses me in so many ways.

249
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,418
Did she say anything else?

250
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,170
Maybe there's more.

251
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:40,257
"Technically, I killed him."

252
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:43,510
What?

253
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:47,222
"The person who killed your dad 
is in this town."

254
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,809
"So leave this town."

255
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:57,107
This is what Choi said to Mi-ran.

256
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:01,111
What do you think it means?

257
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,781
That the murderer is someone else

258
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:08,660
and they're in the town now?

259
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:15,125
So who is the murderer? Did he tell her?

260
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,045
I think he tried to tell her that night,

261
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,298
but he got a call and left urgently.

262
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,219
If only we had Choi's phone right now…

263
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,478
So how much is it?

264
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:38,815
You wanted us to count it? 
I didn't touch it to avoid temptation.

265
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,401
I'd say about one billion won?

266
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,154
One billion?

267
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:47,616
Yes, this bag is 
about the size of my safe.

268
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:49,159
It must be about one billion.

269
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,704
Maybe you don't know.

270
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,460
Anyway, we found the ledger.

271
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:02,506
Now what? Is there more to find?

272
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,592
Oh, are we going back to Seoul then?

273
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:06,718
You sound excited.

274
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,596
Back there, 
you'll have to work overtime every--

275
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,014
I'll stay here.

276
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,686
I'll go back after catching the culprit 
who killed Choi.

277
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:18,939
Come on, Yu-gyeong.

278
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,149
We can do that back in Seoul too.

279
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,693
-We'll ask the Violent Crimes Team-- 
-I'll catch them.

280
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:28,073
I want to catch them myself.

281
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:38,166
You've gone through a lot to get this far, 
and you won't stop?

282
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,005
And you? 
Do you want to go back or stay here?

283
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:44,965
You decide.

284
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,759
Come on, Captain.

285
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,639
Of course, I've lost something too.

286
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,519
I've lost the… You know…

287
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,105
That thing…

288
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,860
Where's my wrist guard?

289
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:08,530
I don't see my wrist guard.

290
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:12,159
It's got to be somewhere here.

291
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,876
Why are you so surprised? 
Did you see a ghost?

292
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,297
Are you sure you want people to see this?

293
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,882
It's got to be here.

294
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,217
Mom, where's my wrist guard?

295
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,511
-Move, you punk. 
-Move!

296
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:33,138
Move, you bastard!

297
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,348
What's the big deal? What is it?

298
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:37,100
What is it about?

299
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,728
The woman and the man love each other.

300
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:42,772
And she isn't so well-off 
while he's quite rich.

301
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:46,818
So it's been a roller coaster for the two, 
going back and forth and squabbling.

302
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,237
And they finally decided to get married.

303
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:53,450
But the man's mother hates her so much.

304
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:56,536
When she went to meet her mom 
to end everything, she realized

305
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,455
that they knew each other.

306
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,333
So what happened

307
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,878
is that the man's mom 
got married young and had a child.

308
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:09,507
But then she fell in love 
with some rich old man.

309
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:12,010
So she gave her son to her friend

310
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,263
and married this old man, 
pretending it's her first time.

311
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,057
And the truth is being revealed.

312
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,392
That's so complicated.

313
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,311
So what's the message?

314
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:25,941
That those who have affairs 
pay the price someday.

315
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,817
Keep that in mind.

316
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,570
I can forgive you 
for being incompetent, unsuccessful,

317
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:33,073
and not getting married,

318
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:36,409
but I'll never forgive you 
for doing nasty things like that.

319
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:40,163
I'll literally cut off your limbs 
if you ever break someone's heart.

320
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:45,585
Jeez, that's just not enough!

321
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,629
He deserves to be struck by lightning!

322
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,799
He's not Pikachu. 
What do you mean, lightning?

323
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:51,758
Hey!

324
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,053
That won't be enough.

325
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:59,224
We should strip him and make him 
a human lightning rod on a building!

326
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,186
I had no idea 
Baek-du was that kind of boy.

327
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,398
I thought he was an innocent kid. 
I feel so betrayed.

328
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,942
Kids like him can get reckless

329
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,652
when they're into something.

330
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,989
Jeez, I'm not sure about this.

331
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,366
If this spreads, I'll be in big trouble.

332
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,743
I told you not to tell anyone.

333
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,037
Babe, this kind of matter should be shared

334
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,957
and discussed together 
so we can plan what to do.

335
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,542
This is a serious issue.

336
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,710
-She's right. 
-Yes!

337
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,421
We're talking about infidelity here.

338
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,214
Seriously.

339
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:33,925
Are you sure it was her?

340
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,011
Maybe you mistook her for someone else.

341
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:38,555
I think it was her.

342
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:41,099
As soon as I saw the two at the terminal,

343
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:44,185
I thought, "Isn't that 
the ssireum team's general manager?"

344
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:48,273
Come on. That's not enough proof.

345
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:52,861
This is a crucial issue 
that may cause a bloodbath in Geosan.

346
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:54,529
We need solid evidence.

347
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,406
But what can we do?

348
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:59,951
Let's go and check for ourselves.

349
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:05,040
Captain, I still--

350
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,500
Put the bag in the car first.

351
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,336
-But-- 
-Put the bag in first.

352
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,723
Why do you have to do this?

353
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,475
Sorry?

354
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,810
Staying here for the investigation.

355
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,354
Are you seeing someone here?

356
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:31,107
What? That's nonsense!

357
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,318
And your obsession with this case isn't?

358
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:40,575
Is there any other reason?

359
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,288
Actually, the thing is…

360
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,208
Well…

361
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,966
I'll give you ten days 
to catch the culprit.

362
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:58,468
I can't give you any longer.

363
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,014
What's that?

364
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,814
Did you do something wrong here?

365
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:11,898
No.

366
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,568
Is she the girl you saw at the terminal?

367
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,528
Yes.

368
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,363
-Are you sure? 
-I'm sure.

369
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,199
This is not good.

370
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,160
By the way, who's that woman next to her?

371
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:28,415
She must be her mother-in-law.

372
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:30,917
Her mother-in-law?

373
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,296
Mom.

374
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:36,923
What?

375
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,218
I think I lost something.

376
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,762
What did you lose this time?

377
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,973
It's not like that.

378
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,769
I mean, I don't know what it is.

379
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,104
What are you saying?

380
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,064
Mom, listen to me.

381
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,190
I lost something.

382
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:57,110
I definitely lost something. 
I'm sure of it.

383
00:28:57,193 --> 00:29:00,071
But when someone asks me what I lost,

384
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,407
I can't give them the answer.

385
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:05,744
I can't give her the answer,

386
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:09,164
so she doesn't understand me, 
and I get upset.

387
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:13,209
I just need to know what I lost.

388
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,669
-Are you seeing a girl? 
-I'm--

389
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:19,257
It's that girl 
who slapped your forehead, right?

390
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:20,967
Right?

391
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:29,225
So my baby boy has been up to something 
other than ssireum, huh?

392
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:32,061
What's wrong? She wouldn't understand you?

393
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,938
-That's not it. 
-Who is she?

394
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,816
-Do I know her? 
-It's nothing like that. Gosh.

395
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,570
Come on, I'm your mom. 
You can tell me anything.

396
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:43,323
What's the problem? 
Is the relationship not going well?

397
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:44,991
Mom, please!

398
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:51,706
Jeez. Look at him all excited.

399
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,667
Tell me. Who is she?

400
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,303
I definitely saw it.

401
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,279
Zero, five, six.

402
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,282
Two…

403
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,537
-Hurry up! 
-Okay.

404
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,248
Nice. It's empty now.

405
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,750
Mi-ran, give us each a coffee.

406
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,127
-Bring that table there. 
-Okay.

407
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,671
-Lift this. 
-Okay.

408
00:30:39,754 --> 00:30:41,548
Make sure to put them back later.

409
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:42,674
-Okay. 
-Sit down.

410
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:43,675
-Have a seat. 
-Okay.

411
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,593
Here. Have a seat.

412
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,178
Sit down, guys.

413
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,513
Okay.

414
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:49,973
All right.

415
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:53,309
This is more than just a love affair.

416
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:54,686
-Right. 
-I agree.

417
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,938
If Tae-baek finds out about this--

418
00:30:57,021 --> 00:30:59,107
Baek-du will be dead meat.

419
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,818
Do you guys remember that incident?

420
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,069
What?

421
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,988
When Han-ra was a high school senior,

422
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:09,242
he tried smoking cigarettes with friends 
after the college entrance exam.

423
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,994
But Tae-baek caught him

424
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:15,331
and knocked some sense into him 
with all kinds of ssireum techniques.

425
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,167
I heard that after that day,

426
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,879
he shakes like a leaf 
whenever he sees a cigarette.

427
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:24,048
I heard that 
Han-ra's recent checkup results showed

428
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,551
that his lungs were 
as healthy as a 7-year-old's.

429
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:27,760
A seven-year-old?

430
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,345
-No way. 
-Seven?

431
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,222
-You heard him. 
-Yes.

432
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:35,476
If Tae-baek finds this out, 
Baek-du will be dead meat.

433
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,270
-Right. 
-Right?

434
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:41,024
So all of you, keep your mouths shut.

435
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,609
-Okay. 
-Okay.

436
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,360
-Keep quiet. 
-Mi-ran, you too.

437
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,946
I will keep quiet

438
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:51,451
if you tell me who Baek-du 
is involved with in this affair.

439
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,621
Well, it's…

440
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:55,622
Wait.

441
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:56,664
What was her name?

442
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:59,000
Yu-gyeong! Oh Yu-gyeong!

443
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:00,710
Oh Yu-gyeong!

444
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,171
Keep quiet, okay?

445
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,216
I knew this would happen one day.

446
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:17,560
One, two, three, four.

447
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,604
One, two…

448
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,189
Six, seven…

449
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,108
Thirteen.

450
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,443
-Twenty-one. 
-Sixty-eight.

451
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:26,986
Hey, what's up?

452
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:30,365
What?

453
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:32,617
What did you just say?

454
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:36,287
It's the talk of the town right now.

455
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,581
I'm not lying to you.

456
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:42,585
Do you know anything about it?

457
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:46,923
I mean, you're with them all the time.

458
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,675
So I thought you might know

459
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:52,095
if there's something going on 
between them.

460
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:55,723
Mom, Baek-du may be foolish sometimes,

461
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,558
but he's not that reckless.

462
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,066
All right.

463
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,318
Keep pushing.

464
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:10,321
-We got this. 
-Let's do this.

465
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,032
Hey, Kim Baek-du!

466
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,035
You.

467
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,454
Live a moral life, okay?

468
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,874
What did I do?

469
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:23,292
You…

470
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,589
If you live immorally like that,

471
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,300
you'll end up in hell.

472
00:33:33,302 --> 00:33:37,265
Jeez, who goes to hell 
for skipping some numbers?

473
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,186
Yes!

474
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,230
Right, Baek-du?

475
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:45,940
Where's Baek-du?

476
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,277
He said something came up, 
so we should play without him.

477
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,698
But we need him here. He loses every bet.

478
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,116
Did he say it'd take long?

479
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,451
I don't know.

480
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,245
I saw him entering 
the general manager's office.

481
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:01,205
What? Again?

482
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:04,083
He goes to that office all the time.

483
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,752
Maybe he likes her.

484
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:07,462
-Oh, come on. 
-What? Why not?

485
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,504
He does.

486
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:13,384
Listen. Two adults 
see and greet each other every day.

487
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:16,721
They could totally develop feelings 
for each other.

488
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,139
You're right!

489
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,557
She even recommended

490
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,977
Baek-du as the coach out of the blue.

491
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,396
Right. The other day, 
before the championship,

492
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,565
Baek-du carried her on his back

493
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,525
when he was running to lose weight.

494
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,028
-Right! 
-He was smiling all along!

495
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,448
-Now, I get it! 
-He got it.

496
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:38,326
My intuition is telling me 
that this is right.

497
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,995
-You know I'm intuitive. 
-I do.

498
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:44,207
There's definitely 
something going on between--

499
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,501
But Ms. Oh is married.

500
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,216
Ho-deok, you're out.

501
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,819
Why are you looking at me like that?

502
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,740
Drop that stare if you don't want to die.

503
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:20,910
Okay.

504
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:26,916
Why did you come to work so late today?

505
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,751
Mi-suk came by.

506
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,420
Oh, Mi-suk.

507
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:37,093
Is Mi-suk really still not married?

508
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:41,848
She had one short marriage, 
and she's single now.

509
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,142
Is that so?

510
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:48,688
No wonder. She's a very proactive woman.

511
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:55,736
Hey.

512
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,364
Do you have something to tell me?

513
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:00,032
What is it?

514
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,534
Well…

515
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,411
Look.

516
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,831
I lost a lot of things too.

517
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,833
What?

518
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:15,882
After you left like that, 
I lost a lot of things too.

519
00:36:18,426 --> 00:36:19,302
What are they?

520
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,220
What?

521
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:24,515
What did you lose? 
You just said you lost a lot of things.

522
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,768
Right.

523
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:30,897
Anchovy gimbap.

524
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:33,691
What?

525
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:36,527
Remember I used to love anchovy gimbap?

526
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:40,448
When we were young, 
we used to eat it a lot.

527
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,283
But after you left for Seoul,

528
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,745
I couldn't eat anchovy gimbap 
because seeing it reminded me of you.

529
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,038
That's one thing I lost.

530
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,666
There's more.

531
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,543
I also lost a good ssireum partner.

532
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,128
I've been thinking,

533
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,006
and I made the junior champion

534
00:36:57,089 --> 00:37:00,718
all because you and I used 
to practice ssireum all the time.

535
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:04,305
That's how I became a junior champion.

536
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,057
So after you left,

537
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,143
I lost my ssireum partner.

538
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,938
You know? And…

539
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:14,357
You know what? Go.

540
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:18,694
I don't have time for chitchat. I'm busy.

541
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:22,365
I have only ten days now.

542
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:25,534
Ten days? What do you mean?

543
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,954
I promised to Mi-suk 
that I'd solve the case

544
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,705
and go back to Seoul in ten days.

545
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,794
What? Ten days?

546
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:40,007
You're going back to Seoul in ten days?

547
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,635
I should. What else can I do?

548
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:46,055
How strange. I definitely put it here.

549
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:50,268
Darn it.

550
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,312
Oh, here it is.

551
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:59,235
If you have nothing else to say…

552
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:12,915
Baek-du and who?

553
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,876
You know the couple that lives 
at the end of the alley.

554
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,128
-She's the wife. 
-Hey!

555
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,754
That makes no sense.

556
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:22,883
Are you saying there's something going on 
between Baek-du and that married woman?

557
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:25,553
Well, according to the rumor, yes.

558
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:28,556
Jeez, you clearly don't know Baek-du.

559
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,851
He may be too soft and silly sometimes,

560
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,186
but he's not a scumbag.

561
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,398
If he were, 
I wouldn't be friends with him now.

562
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:41,068
But look at him standing there. 
The rumor can't be entirely baseless.

563
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,406
What's he doing there?

564
00:38:46,115 --> 00:38:47,700
He must be shocked.

565
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,244
His wife is having an affair 
with another man.

566
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,457
See? He's totally stunned.

567
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,213
Is this what he meant by the evil girl?

568
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,975
Don't you run your mouth about this.

569
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:13,934
Okay.

570
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:28,032
Captain. I'll stay with Yu-gyeong 
and go back in ten days.

571
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:32,411
I'm such a sweet junior.

572
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:38,376
How could she be like that?

573
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,586
Is she not sad about it?

574
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:45,299
How could she say she's going back 
to Seoul like it's nothing?

575
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:49,595
How cold-hearted.

576
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:09,698
By the way, isn't the atmosphere 
in the town odd lately?

577
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,784
-Why? 
-What about the atmosphere?

578
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,619
Well, it's…

579
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,996
I don't know how to describe it.

580
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,123
How should I put it?

581
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,543
When I walk on the street,

582
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:24,380
I feel eyes on the back of my head.

583
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:25,381
You too?

584
00:40:25,464 --> 00:40:26,841
-I felt the same. 
-Right?

585
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:30,511
Yes. And someone even told me 
that I should knock sense into my brother.

586
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,972
But I have no idea which one they meant.

587
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,558
-Who said that? 
-The supermarket owner.

588
00:40:35,641 --> 00:40:37,685
-He said that? 
-Yeah!

589
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,645
He can't have said that about me.

590
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:42,314
The money I spent on snacks there 
should be enough

591
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,316
to cover one full month's rent.

592
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:52,658
What?

593
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,078
It's not me either. 
I didn't do anything wrong.

594
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,788
Why are you looking at me?

595
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,541
I'm telling you.

596
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,626
The atmosphere is somehow different.

597
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,754
What do you mean? Different how?

598
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:10,759
Well, before, they saw me 
as a handsome, stylish, smart,

599
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:13,846
but humble, personable,

600
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:16,807
witty and charming man. But now…

601
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,350
You must have lost your mind.

602
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:23,105
These days, I feel like 
they're kind of pitying me.

603
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:27,443
-What's wrong with that? 
-What?

604
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:29,987
Now, they must see the real you.

605
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,155
Where's the problem?

606
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,616
-Well… 
-Gosh, you're…

607
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,951
You're so weird.

608
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:45,252
But something has definitely changed.

609
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,423
-Oh, my. 
-It's Baek-du.

610
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:55,804
Hi.

611
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:11,028
Hi.

612
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,781
"Hi"? I can't believe him.

613
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,866
Look at him looking so happy.

614
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,285
Why are they staring at me like that?

615
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:48,857
Isn't she that woman?

616
00:42:48,941 --> 00:42:49,900
Who?

617
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:55,406
Oh, that's her?

618
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,658
How could that fine-looking woman do that?

619
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:58,576
I know, right?

620
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:01,870
She can probably do that 
because she looks fine, you know?

621
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,455
You're right. Goodness.

622
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,001
She looks quiet and coy, though.

623
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:08,210
You think so?

624
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:11,088
I know a bit about reading people,

625
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,299
and her face says she's not.

626
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,925
-Really? 
-Really?

627
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,760
-Who? 
-Oh, hi.

628
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:18,512
Who were you gossiping about?

629
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:21,265
Yu-gyeong?

630
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:24,351
Don't you have work to do?

631
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,813
Jeez.

632
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:30,065
What are they whispering about?

633
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,362
Yu-gyeong.

634
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:41,285
Hey, what's up?

635
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:45,205
Would you like a cup of coffee?

636
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:46,999
Right now?

637
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:00,512
The coffee machine 
isn't turned on yet, so…

638
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:02,556
I see.

639
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,144
So do you have something to tell me?

640
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:10,230
Yes, I remembered something.

641
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:16,403
It's about the phone call he got 
when we were in his car.

642
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,280
I'm not entirely sure,

643
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,699
but I think the number started with 056.

644
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:23,952
Zero-five-six-two--

645
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:26,246
Zero-five-six? That's…

646
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,873
The region code of this area.

647
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:36,757
By the way, you must be in quite a fix.

648
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:40,010
-What do you mean? 
-Don't you know?

649
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:43,180
There's a juicy scandal 
unfolding in this town right now.

650
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,265
Guess who's involved?

651
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:47,685
I'm not sure.

652
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,604
You and Baek-du.

653
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,526
You should've been careful.

654
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,028
Everyone's fussing about it now.

655
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:02,658
They're determined to split you up 
before his parents find out.

656
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,412
Unbelievable.

657
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,421
I thought you should know.

658
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,923
You've been through this already.

659
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,384
Once word spreads,

660
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:24,763
people won't care 
whether it's really true or not.

661
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,682
They'll just believe it.

662
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:29,435
They haven't changed a bit.

663
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:41,238
Keep going. It's about tenacity.

664
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:42,865
Keep holding out.

665
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,325
-Jeong-hun, hold him more tightly. 
-Nice.

666
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:47,828
Good. A little more.

667
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,163
Back out.

668
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:51,540
-Turn him. 
-Like this?

669
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:56,128
Let's do this.

670
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:16,982
She should've come to work a while ago, 
but she's still not here.

671
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,295
What will you nag me about this time?

672
00:46:43,091 --> 00:46:45,969
What is it? Go ahead and say it.

673
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:50,474
Why is everyone acting weird today, 
all sneakily glancing at me?

674
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,476
Baek-du, you…

675
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,148
You seem so distracted.

676
00:46:58,690 --> 00:46:59,816
Get your act together!

677
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,367
Is he only watching me when we train?

678
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:11,328
Jeez.

679
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:23,382
ROSE INN

680
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:29,012
Apparently, the man who was staying here 
died in an accident.

681
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:31,181
I don't know

682
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:34,977
if she was his daughter or niece,

683
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:37,104
but some young woman came the other day

684
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:42,067
and took everything in this room, 
saying he was never coming back.

685
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:43,944
Right. I heard about it.

686
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:49,700
Why did you want 
to check this room, Detective?

687
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:55,205
Did that man have some problem?

688
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,292
When he rented this room,

689
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,336
did he give you 
his phone number or something?

690
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:05,549
Well, he paid 
the entire rent upfront in cash.

691
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:09,344
So I didn't need his phone number.

692
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,680
I didn't even ask him.

693
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:27,696
USED CARS

694
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:31,491
Has anyone else stayed in this room 
since then?

695
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,660
No way.

696
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:37,497
He paid for a few months upfront.

697
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:40,334
Whether he was dead or alive,

698
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:44,921
I thought it'd be only right not 
to rent it out during his rental period.

699
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:46,882
So I left the room untouched.

700
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,060
Hey, aren't you going home?

701
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,187
You can go.

702
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:03,398
Let's go.

703
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,776
-Let's go. 
-Let's go.

704
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:07,653
Why hasn't she come to work yet?

705
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:10,155
People might find this suspicious.

706
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,028
Hey, Du-sik!

707
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,701
-Hey. 
-What?

708
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:59,246
Why are you so late?

709
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,206
I've been waiting for you here.

710
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:02,958
Waiting for me? Why?

711
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:05,961
I have something to tell you.

712
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:09,881
Okay. What is it?

713
00:50:09,965 --> 00:50:12,259
Well, it's just that…

714
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:17,347
By the way, 
you shouldn't be late to work like this.

715
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:19,099
People will find it suspicious.

716
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,226
"Something's fishy about that manager."

717
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:23,520
"Maybe she's not really a manager."

718
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:25,856
What if a weird rumor like this spreads?

719
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,986
That's not the rumor 
you should worry about.

720
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:36,032
Do you know what rumors 
are going around about you and me?

721
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,618
-About you and me? 
-Yes.

722
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:41,663
Mi-ran told me that…

723
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:50,464
There's a rumor going around 
in this town, that we're dating.

724
00:50:51,214 --> 00:50:52,132
What?

725
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:54,676
Dating?

726
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,971
That makes sense!

727
00:50:58,054 --> 00:51:01,224
That's why people have been 
whispering around me

728
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,143
and giving me the evil eye.

729
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,854
-Now I get it. 
-What?

730
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,939
-Never mind. 
-What are you talking about?

731
00:51:08,482 --> 00:51:10,275
So what did you say to Mi-ran?

732
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,986
I said it wasn't true, of course.

733
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,365
Oh, you said it wasn't true. I see.

734
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:18,658
Because it's not.

735
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:23,121
So if someone asks you

736
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,040
what's going on between us

737
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:27,709
and if we're really dating, 
you should say,

738
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:30,295
"No way! Not in a million years!"

739
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,589
"If you keep spreading this weird rumor,

740
00:51:33,089 --> 00:51:35,926
I'll sue you for defamation 
and spreading false rumors,

741
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:39,095
under the Criminal Act, 
Article 307, Paragraph 2."

742
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:40,889
Put your foot down like that.

743
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:45,894
What now? Why are you pouting again?

744
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,020
What do you mean?

745
00:51:51,149 --> 00:51:55,445
Anyway, be careful not to fuel this rumor.

746
00:51:56,863 --> 00:51:58,240
You know,

747
00:51:58,990 --> 00:52:02,619
once a rumor spreads, 
it can become unstoppable.

748
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,250
Why aren't you saying anything?

749
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,709
-Be careful, okay? 
-Fine.

750
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,420
I'll explain to people that it's not true. 
Happy now?

751
00:52:14,047 --> 00:52:15,048
What the…

752
00:52:19,177 --> 00:52:21,721
Hey! What is it 
that you wanted to say to me?

753
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:25,517
Kim Baek-du!

754
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:32,691
What's wrong with him?

755
00:52:43,368 --> 00:52:44,995
There's nothing going on?

756
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:49,708
How could there be nothing between us?

757
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,336
There's at least a friendship.

758
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:56,548
And even though it was a mistake,

759
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:01,303
we even did that thing too.

760
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:04,598
So the rumor isn't completely false.

761
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:11,938
-Come here. 
-What's wrong?

762
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,232
-We need to talk. 
-What's this about?

763
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:16,067
-What's going on? 
-Just follow us.

764
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:17,611
Are you bullying me?

765
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,279
What are you talking about?

766
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,031
I'll tell my dad about this!

767
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,991
-Your dad? 
-Gosh!

768
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,409
You little brat.

769
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:27,162
You have no idea 
what's going on right now, do you?

770
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:30,957
We're actually trying to save you 
from your dad, you idiot.

771
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:33,168
What are you talking about?

772
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,210
Baek-du.

773
00:53:34,794 --> 00:53:37,923
What's your relationship 
with that woman named Oh Yu-gyeong?

774
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:38,924
What?

775
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:42,135
Rumor has it that there's something 
going on between you two.

776
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:43,219
Is that true?

777
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:48,016
He's not saying anything. 
There must really be something.

778
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,936
Don't you know that's infidelity?

779
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,813
And that's a horrible thing to do, 
you brat!

780
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:57,734
Jeez, as they say, 
it's always the quiet ones.

781
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,527
I'm really disappointed, you know.

782
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,196
Baek-du.

783
00:54:01,738 --> 00:54:05,241
You better end it when it's just us 
warning you. Understand?

784
00:54:09,496 --> 00:54:10,956
Guys.

785
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,750
If that's what all this is about, 
don't you worry.

786
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:16,795
Because that's absolute nonsense.

787
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:20,715
Listen. Between the two of us,

788
00:54:21,424 --> 00:54:23,551
there is nothing going on.

789
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:25,804
Not in a million years.

790
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:30,100
If you keep spreading this weird rumor, 
I will… You know…

791
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:34,562
I will sue you all according to some law.

792
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:39,567
I'm putting my foot down.

793
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:47,158
This is what you were 
all fussing about? Jeez.

794
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:50,829
-Wait, then… 
-Well…

795
00:54:50,912 --> 00:54:52,872
What is he muttering about?

796
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:55,417
Hey, Jin-suk doesn't know 
about it yet, right?

797
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:58,586
No, she doesn't.

798
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,383
Maybe I should spill it all out.

799
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,844
No way. 
Think about what will happen afterward.

800
00:55:07,345 --> 00:55:09,973
I'm just saying. I'm not crazy, you know.

801
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:15,645
It's just that she keeps cluelessly saying 
that she kind of likes her,

802
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:18,898
that we shouldn't bully a newcomer, 
and things like that.

803
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,608
My gosh.

804
00:55:20,692 --> 00:55:23,069
Once she finds out she's seeing Baek-du,

805
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,655
-she's going to regret it. 
-This is so upsetting.

806
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:28,450
I think it'll happen soon, though.

807
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:29,951
-Why? 
-Why?

808
00:55:30,535 --> 00:55:33,079
That boy Baek-du is an open book.

809
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,373
He won't be able 
to keep it secret for long.

810
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:39,753
Actually, at their team dinner 
the other day,

811
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:46,301
Baek-du kept putting 
the cooked meat on her plate.

812
00:55:46,384 --> 00:55:48,303
It was so obvious.

813
00:55:48,386 --> 00:55:50,180
-My gosh. 
-That bastard.

814
00:55:50,263 --> 00:55:52,474
And the other boys next to him

815
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:54,768
were gobbling the meat 
even before it was cooked.

816
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,771
I mean, can you believe the dedication?

817
00:55:58,354 --> 00:56:00,106
He's crazy about her.

818
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,192
-My goodness. 
-Unbelievable.

819
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,735
Guys.

820
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:07,072
Don't tell others about this, okay?

821
00:56:07,155 --> 00:56:09,616
-Of course we won't. 
-We won't.

822
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,077
If Jin-suk hears about this,

823
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,829
that'll be the end of us.

824
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:17,499
She's got a disastrous temper, you know.

825
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:19,167
What are you talking about?

826
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:20,585
Oh, my gosh.

827
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:25,048
-Hi, Jin-suk. 
-Hey.

828
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:26,132
Hey, you're here.

829
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:31,137
Hey. Were you just talking 
about my boy, Baek-du?

830
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:34,182
-No. 
-We were talking about baeksuk…

831
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:37,018
Tell me what you were talking about.

832
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:38,436
Well, it's…

833
00:56:41,231 --> 00:56:42,565
Tell me now!

834
00:56:42,649 --> 00:56:43,817
-Goodness. 
-Jeez.

835
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:46,820
Gosh, Jin-suk.

836
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:48,363
Calm down.

837
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:52,283
Let's talk back in the store.

838
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:54,702
-There are people watching here. 
-Right.

839
00:56:54,786 --> 00:56:56,579
No, let go of me.

840
00:56:56,663 --> 00:57:00,208
Tell me here, while people are watching.

841
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,418
Calm down, Jin-suk.

842
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:04,629
-Jin-suk. 
-People can hear you.

843
00:57:06,798 --> 00:57:08,049
The thing is…

844
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:13,179
I don't know what to say.

845
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,266
-So… 
-Gosh.

846
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:19,144
-The thing is… 
-What's going on now?

847
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:29,904
There's this rumor 
that Baek-du is dating Yu-gyeong.

848
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:32,198
What does that mean?

849
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,909
You mean he's dating a married woman?

850
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:36,494
Is that what it is?

851
00:57:37,287 --> 00:57:38,496
My goodness.

852
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,667
Baek-du! You little…

853
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:44,377
Tell me.

854
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,130
Is it true?

855
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:48,590
What are you talking about?

856
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:52,927
People say that you're dating 
this woman named Yu-gyeong.

857
00:57:53,011 --> 00:57:53,845
Is that true?

858
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:55,972
Mom, don't be like this with me too.

859
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:58,766
Hey! Answer me!

860
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:02,979
If it's true, 
you deserve a good humiliation here,

861
00:58:03,062 --> 00:58:04,981
and if it isn't true,

862
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:08,234
you deserve apologies from these people. 
Am I wrong?

863
00:58:10,862 --> 00:58:12,197
Come on. Answer me!

864
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,656
Mom, it's…

865
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,993
Jeez, this is why they say 
it's always the quiet ones.

866
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:20,997
My gosh.

867
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:29,589
This is unbelievable.

868
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,680
I wonder what Du-sik's family will do now.

869
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:40,016
I guess they'll have to leave soon.

870
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:42,310
I feel so bad for them.

871
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:43,561
Even if they stay here,

872
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:45,188
-That poor girl. 
-I wouldn't like it.

873
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:46,814
-I feel so bad. 
-I can't believe

874
00:58:46,898 --> 00:58:49,067
that Jun fixed the match.

875
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:51,903
How could he do that to Cheol-yong?

876
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:54,072
Keep it down. She might hear you.

877
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:57,033
How embarrassing.

878
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,368
You know what?

879
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,120
You won't believe me.

880
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:07,210
Even if I say it's not true, 
none of you here will believe me.

881
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:09,420
I know that.

882
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:11,589
What are you saying?

883
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:13,341
If you say it's not, it's not.

884
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:16,427
-What do you mean-- 
-This has happened before!

885
00:59:18,054 --> 00:59:18,930
What?

886
00:59:19,013 --> 00:59:22,600
This happened to Du-sik

887
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:24,477
a long time ago.

888
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:30,066
Du-sik's family kept saying 
it wasn't true,

889
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:33,945
but none of you believed them. Am I wrong?

890
00:59:34,529 --> 00:59:36,197
You all kicked them out in the end!

891
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,785
And now you're accusing people 
of something they didn't do,

892
00:59:40,868 --> 00:59:42,662
and trying to hurt them.

893
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:44,622
Is that it?

894
00:59:45,415 --> 00:59:49,627
Are you trying to kick someone out again? 
Is that what you want?

895
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:55,800
Please, just please.

896
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:59,178
Stop it, okay?

897
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:02,890
It can be hurtful to some people.

898
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:05,602
Most of you here probably don't know

899
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:08,021
or even care about it,

900
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:11,566
but those who are wrongfully accused

901
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,611
will live the rest of their lives in pain.

902
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:18,364
So please…

903
01:00:19,282 --> 01:00:20,908
Just please!

904
01:00:57,320 --> 01:00:59,197
Du-sik, wait!

905
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,241
Where are you going?

906
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,411
Oh Du-sik!

907
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:08,665
Oh Du-sik!

908
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,834
Where are you going?

909
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:15,630
Oh Du-sik!

910
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:20,510
Where are you going?

911
01:02:00,967 --> 01:02:03,302
About the rumor…

912
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,769
-It's half right and half wrong. 
-What?

913
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,855
It may not be true to you, 
but it is to me.

914
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:19,110
Look, Baek-du. 
You've been acting really weird lately.

915
01:02:19,652 --> 01:02:23,865
You say you have something to tell me, 
but you always end up just rambling.

916
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:26,617
-Could you just tell me-- 
-I like you.

917
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:29,620
What?

918
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:32,206
So let's do it together.

919
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:37,295
Do what?

920
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:39,380
What you're doing now.

921
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:43,176
What you've been trying to find 
all your life. Let me do it with you.

922
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:50,099
Kim Baek-du, you…

923
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:53,394
You showed up out of the blue, 
and you're saying such weird--

924
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:57,940
Remember you asked me what I've lost?

925
01:02:58,024 --> 01:02:59,275
I found the answer.

926
01:03:01,527 --> 01:03:03,404
It's you.

927
01:03:04,238 --> 01:03:07,950
I lost anchovy gimbap 
and a good ssireum partner.

928
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:10,745
But that was all because I lost you.

929
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:16,459
Since you left, they meant nothing to me.

930
01:03:19,378 --> 01:03:23,132
Do you know 
how often I think of that night

931
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,092
and how much I regret it?

932
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:27,178
"I should've run faster."

933
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:30,306
"I should've called your name out louder."

934
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:31,265
No.

935
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:34,685
"I should've run out 
of the house earlier."

936
01:03:35,394 --> 01:03:39,106
No. "I should've taken the hint

937
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:43,778
when you came to my house."

938
01:03:44,946 --> 01:03:48,032
I've regretted it 
hundreds of thousands of times.

939
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:51,077
But I don't want 
to regret anything anymore.

940
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:56,207
I was too young back then

941
01:03:57,291 --> 01:04:00,044
to do anything to stop you. 
I had to let you go.

942
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:02,171
But this time, I won't let you.

943
01:04:06,175 --> 01:04:08,302
This time,

944
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:11,639
I won't just let you go like that.

945
01:04:16,519 --> 01:04:17,353
Look, Oh Du-sik.

946
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:22,149
I really like you.

947
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:28,239
I really do. I like you so much.

948
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:44,505
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

949
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,238
Did you put on blusher?

950
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:12,116
Blusher? What are you talking about?

951
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:13,117
About Snowball…

952
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:15,995
I feel like someone might be 
unleashing her on purpose.

953
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,748
Why are they coming out of the same house?

954
01:05:18,831 --> 01:05:21,584
Baek-du and your manager 
definitely have something going on.

955
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:23,586
Don't you think we should step up?

956
01:05:23,669 --> 01:05:25,796
Wow, so it was true.

957
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:29,467
Yu-gyeong, you've got to focus. 
I'm here because of you.

958
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:32,762
I have a crush on someone else. 
It's Du-sik!

959
01:05:32,845 --> 01:05:34,972
Baek-du, I…

960
01:05:36,849 --> 01:05:38,851
