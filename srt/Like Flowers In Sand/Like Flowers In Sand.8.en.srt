1
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:45,962
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

2
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:49,048
Number one and four are mine.

3
00:00:49,132 --> 00:00:52,051
Two and three are Jin-su's, 
and five is Baek-du's.

4
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:56,222
You have to jump 
to seven and eight at once.

5
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:59,309
If you step on the line, you're out.

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,895
-Du-sik, just give up. 
-I'll do it. Be quiet.

7
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:05,065
-You're too weak. 
-Just give up.

8
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,275
-Don't push yourself. 
-It's impossible.

9
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,779
She can't do it.

10
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,238
It's really far.

11
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,704
What the…

12
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:22,207
What just happened?

13
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,254
She really did it.

14
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,714
I didn't step on the line.

15
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:32,509
We should test her for doping.

16
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,511
That ugly girl is so good.

17
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,930
I mean, what is she, a frog?

18
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,681
-How did she jump to… 
-Hey, stop.

19
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:39,766
-Stop it. 
-Stop.

20
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,852
-That little brat. 
-What's your problem? You're dead meat.

21
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,980
Du-sik, stop.

22
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,565
-Du-sik. 
-Hey!

23
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,235
-Hey, wait. 
-Du-sik. Seok-hui.

24
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:08,670
Mi-ran, are you hungry?

25
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,673
I'm getting dinner ready.

26
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:16,678
I saw the other kids playing. 
Why didn't you play with them?

27
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:20,765
What's wrong?

28
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,601
Did they not let you?

29
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,395
Did they leave you out?

30
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,273
I always lose first.

31
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,028
Hopscotch, freeze tag, monkey game… 
Whatever we play,

32
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,781
I lose as soon as we start.

33
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,616
I'm always the weakest link.

34
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,577
And that's not fun.

35
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,834
Dad, how do you spell "coffee" in English?

36
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,544
Coffee?

37
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,853
Dad, when I grow up,

38
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,063
I want to run a big store.

39
00:03:10,356 --> 00:03:11,357
You'll run a store?

40
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,360
Gosh, you'll be so cool.

41
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:16,738
In the store, I'll sell cookies,

42
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:20,241
ice cream, bread, and everything.

43
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:22,160
And I'll be the owner of the store.

44
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,411
I won't be the weakest.

45
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,871
Is that so?

46
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:29,709
But if I want to get you a store, 
I guess I'll have to run

47
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,254
at least ten more businesses.

48
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,966
In return, I'll serve you 
your favorite coffee every day.

49
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,552
Really? Promise me.

50
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:44,307
Thank you. You're the best.

51
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:47,310
All right, Mi-ran.

52
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,396
Come and sit here. Let's eat.

53
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,067
Come on. What are you doing?

54
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,402
-The food is getting cold. 
-Okay.

55
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:06,496
EPISODE 8 
REMEMBER, DON'T REMEMBER

56
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:15,213
Isn't it a bit upsetting 
to see people not recognize you?

57
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:17,840
I didn't like it.

58
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:19,842
How about you?

59
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,473
Well, it's been a long time.

60
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,560
It's been 20 years, right?

61
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,938
Since that incident happened.

62
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:40,822
The tension in the air 
between the two wrestlers is palpable.

63
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,907
Well, this match will decide

64
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:45,243
who goes to the final,

65
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,246
so both of them must be giving their all.

66
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,205
That's right.

67
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,500
The current score is 1-0, 
with Kim leading by one point.

68
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,836
-Stand up. 
-Let's see.

69
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,754
-Will he make it to the final? 
-Ready.

70
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,381
Without giving up any points?

71
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,861
About what happened back then.

72
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,449
Do you think my dad did it too?

73
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:27,035
Like people say?

74
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:30,997
I'm not sure.

75
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,541
I think the actual culprit

76
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:37,128
was Choi Chil-seong.

77
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,133
My dad didn't kill Uncle Cheol-yong.

78
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,094
Choi Chil-seong did.

79
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,848
I see.

80
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53,478
So what are you going to do about it?

81
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,605
Get to the bottom of it?

82
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,401
I know you're a cop.

83
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,879
Kim uses an outer leg skill 
to initiate an attack.

84
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:29,722
But Ha Chang-bae in the red satba 
isn't an easy opponent at all.

85
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:32,266
Successfully fending off Kim's attack,

86
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:35,228
Ha threw Kim over 
with Clenched Interception.

87
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,120
You've been doing a great job until now,

88
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,581
and you lose as soon as we show up. 
You're making me feel bad.

89
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:58,209
Are you okay? 
Did you hurt your arm from the fall?

90
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,168
I'm okay.

91
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:08,845
Yes.

92
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:11,973
I am a cop.

93
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,352
So you must know why I came here.

94
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,729
I'm not sure.

95
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,565
Choi Chil-seong.

96
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,402
I'll find out everything.

97
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,572
Everything related to Choi Chil-seong.

98
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:31,451
Where Choi's secret ledger is,

99
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,913
why he suddenly died here,

100
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,835
and what he did 20 years ago. Everything.

101
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,714
That's why I came to this town.

102
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:48,843
Why would you tell me this?

103
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,847
I thought you would know something.

104
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:55,933
Me?

105
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,353
Du-sik.

106
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:04,233
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

107
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,152
Choi Chil-seong?

108
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:07,987
Who is that?

109
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,447
Twenty years ago,

110
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,911
Choi Chil-seong came to this town 
to meet your dad.

111
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:16,954
I remember it.

112
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,586
I've been wondering 
why he came back to Geosan,

113
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,755
and now I get it.

114
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:28,758
He came to meet you.

115
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,055
He knew you were Joo Cheol-yong's daughter 
and came to meet you.

116
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,265
Right?

117
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,478
You know something.

118
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,940
Telling me

119
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,402
what you know is up to you,

120
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,614
but I just want to tell you

121
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,034
that I lost a lot here too. Just like you.

122
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,872
So I want to solve this case,

123
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:04,585
no matter what.

124
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:10,883
Now, just one round away. 
This is a make-or-break moment.

125
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:11,842
KIM: 1 
HA: 1

126
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,478
Kneel.

127
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,695
-Now, kneeling face to face. 
-Grab satbas.

128
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,113
Let's go, Chang-bae.

129
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,615
Chang-bae, hold it tight!

130
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,452
Lower your body as much as possible.

131
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,871
-Knees up. 
-Grab it tight and take it slow!

132
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:42,498
-Stand up. 
-Take it slow!

133
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:44,208
Ready.

134
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:49,255
The final round begins.

135
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,930
Wait, what's happening?

136
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,475
Kim suddenly let go of Ha's waist satba.

137
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,185
Hey. What did she say?

138
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,936
Did she know anything?

139
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:50,524
Didn't she say anything 
about Choi Chil-seong?

140
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,737
Yu-gyeong, are you okay?

141
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,697
What did she say?

142
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,034
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

143
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:00,993
What?

144
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:03,829
Wait, the match must be over by now.

145
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:05,665
I wonder how it went.

146
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:11,087
You can go home first. 
I need to stop by the office.

147
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,631
Why the office all of a sudden?

148
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,369
Baek-du.

149
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,373
Why do you look so down? 
You did an amazing job today.

150
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,292
What? No, it's nothing.

151
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,753
He's right.

152
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:56,424
I watched your matches, 
and you've definitely still got it.

153
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,342
You think so?

154
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,886
Of course. You were awesome today.

155
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,972
You did a great job.

156
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,265
You're the best.

157
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:08,811
I'm really mad at you right now.

158
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:21,740
GEOSAN-GUN SSIREUM TEAM TO VICTORY

159
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,436
Do you think my dad did it too?

160
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:52,938
Like people say?

161
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,527
OH JUN, JOO CHEOL-YONG

162
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:04,700
KIM TAE-BAEK, OH JUN, JOO CHEOL-YONG

163
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,871
The detective just went 
into Oh Jun's house.

164
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,122
Oh, no.

165
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,791
-I can't watch. I'm too scared. 
-It can't be him.

166
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,336
Oh, my. Look, he's been arrested.

167
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:18,214
-Oh, my goodness. They're taking him. 
-Du-sik!

168
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,840
-Dad! 
-I feel bad for Du-sik.

169
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,467
Du-sik, where are you going?

170
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,801
-Oh, boy. 
-Dad!

171
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,431
Dad!

172
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,642
Dad!

173
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,144
Let go of me!

174
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,437
Dad!

175
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,273
Dad!

176
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:44,365
Jeez, who would have known?

177
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,243
I can't believe 
Jun, that kind man, killed a person.

178
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,871
No, he didn't. He was released 
yesterday after the interrogation.

179
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,499
My goodness.

180
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,419
-This is horrible. 
-My goodness.

181
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,588
-Poor Du-sik. 
-I know.

182
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:00,965
I feel so bad for her.

183
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,635
Look. There she goes.

184
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,865
I'm hurt, Du-sik.

185
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,533
How could you leave without a word?

186
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,743
You're not even replying.

187
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,287
Where are you?

188
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,539
I'm really mad at you right now.

189
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:37,376
Kim Baek-du…

190
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:49,805
Sorry. Something urgent came up…

191
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:14,955
Eat slowly.

192
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,292
Gosh, this is awful.

193
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:24,757
You guys have all shrunk 
into anchovies overnight.

194
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,758
Oh, well.

195
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:29,178
You don't even have the energy to answer?

196
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,181
Eat slowly. You don't want 
to have the runs again.

197
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:37,978
Baek-du, I thought you weren't sick.

198
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:38,896
Sorry?

199
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:40,856
You look the sickest out of everyone here.

200
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,567
No, I'm not sick.

201
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,945
Right? Then why do you look like that?

202
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:53,953
You see, the entire neighborhood 
was excited the whole day

203
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,205
because of you.

204
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:59,333
We were so excited 
to see you back in the groove.

205
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,334
I see.

206
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,589
You know I can't drink.

207
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,257
You should have a glass today.

208
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,011
Just let him fill the glass at least.

209
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,346
You were that good today.

210
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,350
It's been years 
since you were within the top five.

211
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,061
We should celebrate this day.

212
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,783
Guys, raise your glasses.

213
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,872
All the drama aside, well done, everyone.

214
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,667
They say to take the bad with the good.

215
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,920
Since we had 
such extreme bad luck this time,

216
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,589
we'll rock the next championship. Okay?

217
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,882
-Yes, Coach. 
-Yes, Coach.

218
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,427
-And Baek-du. 
-Yes.

219
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,721
You did a great job by yourself today.

220
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,017
Let's keep that momentum going.

221
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,518
-Okay? 
-Yes, Coach.

222
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,229
All right. Geosan-gun Ssireum Team…

223
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,689
-Let's go! 
-Let's go!

224
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,525
Oh, boy.

225
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,068
-Oh, no. 
-Make it quick.

226
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,487
-Jeez. 
-Sang-uk.

227
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,822
-Yes? 
-Make it quick.

228
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:12,823
Okay.

229
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:17,327
Eat slowly.

230
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:43,103
If she read the messages, 
she should reply.

231
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:48,108
I told her I couldn't sleep 
when my texts are ignored.

232
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:52,029
I won't be able to sleep until next year.

233
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:54,656
Darn it.

234
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:02,498
Kim Baek-du. Where are you going?

235
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,752
Something urgent came up.

236
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,295
Wait.

237
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:11,256
Why didn't you do as I said?

238
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,675
What did you say?

239
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,261
I told you not to use minor techniques.

240
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,763
And you used them a lot.

241
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,184
Well, I didn't mean to--

242
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,185
You were good.

243
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:25,479
What?

244
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,481
I had forgotten for a while

245
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,650
that that was how you played ssireum.

246
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:34,696
And that was why 
you were called a ssireum prodigy.

247
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,323
I had completely forgotten

248
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:39,827
that I used to envy you so much.

249
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,250
Anyhow, that was a great match.

250
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,460
Okay.

251
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:52,923
Jin-su.

252
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,384
What?

253
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:16,196
The winner of the 2002 
National Youth Ssireum Competition

254
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,658
is Kim Baek-du 
from Geosan Elementary School.

255
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,202
-Well done, Baek-du! 
-Great job!

256
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,121
-I love you! 
-Well done.

257
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,790
-You were so good! 
-You did so well.

258
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,005
-Baek-du. 
-He's so talented.

259
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:35,007
Well done, Baek-du!

260
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,178
I hate you, bastard.

261
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,267
Du-sik.

262
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,105
Oh Du-sik!

263
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:57,404
Du-sik!

264
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,324
Oh Du-sik!

265
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,951
Where is she at this hour?

266
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,454
Oh Du--

267
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:07,956
Have you lost your mind?

268
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,042
What are you doing here at this hour?

269
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,335
Where did you come from?

270
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,294
-I-- 
-Be quiet.

271
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,129
I was calling you from here--

272
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,214
Hey, wait.

273
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,381
Hey.

274
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,855
What on earth were you doing there 
in the middle of the night?

275
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,651
You just never give me any time 
to stay depressed.

276
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,528
-Never. 
-Oh, please.

277
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,239
I didn't do much.

278
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,531
What are you saying?

279
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,660
You're completely out of it.

280
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,287
Did you drink or something?

281
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,831
Yes, I did.

282
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,709
Didn't you say you couldn't drink?

283
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,462
You said it always makes you black out.

284
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:58,006
Yes, I did say that.

285
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,468
Then, why did you drink?

286
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,972
-You should've been careful-- 
-I said I'd act out!

287
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,391
What?

288
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,268
Seriously,

289
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:13,313
how could you just leave like that 
in the middle of the match?

290
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,899
I thought you were there.

291
00:21:17,818 --> 00:21:19,987
Something urgent came up today, so--

292
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,321
Also, my texts.

293
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,491
You ignored my texts. 
You even left me on read.

294
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,580
You see, leaving someone on read

295
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,709
is a crime.

296
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,046
Fine.

297
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,758
I'm a criminal.

298
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,677
-I'm a criminal. 
-Yes.

299
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,846
You know what?

300
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,473
I'm acting out

301
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,853
largely because of you. You know that?

302
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:55,355
So tell me.

303
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,774
How much did you drink?

304
00:21:58,358 --> 00:21:59,401
Did you drink a lot?

305
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,571
Just a glass of beer.

306
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,283
But seriously, earlier,

307
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:10,162
I just wanted to let loose.

308
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:19,504
You're saying 
one glass of beer is letting loose?

309
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:22,674
Now you're just making me feel bad.

310
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,760
I don't know.

311
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,803
Gosh, I feel sick.

312
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,764
My head hurts and…

313
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,599
-Hey, you're falling over. 
-My head.

314
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,893
-Gosh, I feel horrible. 
-What are you doing?

315
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,438
Hey.

316
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,734
Do you know where I placed in the match?

317
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:42,152
Guess.

318
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,112
-Guess. 
-Fourth place?

319
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,491
Did I do a good job?

320
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:49,534
Yes, you did a good job.

321
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:51,787
Oh, well. Let's go.

322
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,830
No, wait.

323
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:55,874
Could you…

324
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,543
Could you do more of that?

325
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,212
What?

326
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,589
"You did a good job. You were cool."

327
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:05,425
Give me more compliments. 
I want to hear more.

328
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,641
Gosh, you're just…

329
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:15,936
Fine.

330
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:20,816
You were amazing today. 
You did a great job.

331
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:23,735
And?

332
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,447
Keep going.

333
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:28,990
-More? 
-Yeah.

334
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,035
Well…

335
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:36,957
It felt like the old you was back. 
I was glad to see that.

336
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:39,876
The old me?

337
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,836
Yes.

338
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:45,674
You know, you used to 
just enjoy doing ssireum,

339
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,467
regardless of winning or losing.

340
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:51,847
When was that?

341
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,182
I think we were in third grade.

342
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,893
It wasn't long after you started ssireum.

343
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:01,648
You had a match with a big sixth-grader,

344
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:04,276
which was totally absurd.

345
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,987
You were crushed hard.

346
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:12,701
So I thought you'd coop yourself up 
in a restroom and cry,

347
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,286
but I was wrong.

348
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,663
You ran to me with a big smile and said,

349
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,542
"Du-sik, that was so much fun."

350
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,627
"I want to have a match with him again."

351
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:29,759
Goodness, that kid, 
Kim Baek-du, was such a bluffer.

352
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:31,469
That wasn't bluffing.

353
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,513
I was actually impressed.

354
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:36,766
I thought it was so mature 
of you to say that.

355
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,853
I think I bought you a rice cake skewer 
on our way back home.

356
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,108
Well, back then,

357
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:50,697
I thought you'd become 
a successful wrestler in the future.

358
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,785
I had no idea that you'd end up 
a big goofball like this.

359
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,546
But you know what?

360
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:11,843
What I liked about today's match 
wasn't that you took fourth place,

361
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,681
but that you enjoyed it, 
just like the old days.

362
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:21,186
I mean, you can do better next time.

363
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,979
Big things have small beginnings.

364
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,398
And I can assure you,

365
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:28,235
if you maintain this confidence 
in the next match,

366
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:30,445
I'm sure you can be a champion.

367
00:25:30,528 --> 00:25:32,572
What was his name?

368
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,074
Right. Lim Dong-seok.

369
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:36,201
He didn't seem that good either…

370
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:40,914
He wasn't that good either.

371
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,794
Hey, your eyes…

372
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:48,505
What's with the cheesy gaze?

373
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,735
Hey!

374
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:13,113
What was that just now?

375
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,700
I kissed you.

376
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,124
Hey, Kim Baek-du!

377
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:40,515
Jeez!

378
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,767
-Damn. 
-"Damn"?

379
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:51,026
Mom, you scared me. Seriously…

380
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:55,322
You see, 
I'd like to feel good in the morning.

381
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:58,700
So could you please stop 
thrusting your face into mine?

382
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,995
-Show respect to your mom, you brat. 
-Don't.

383
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:02,912
Hey.

384
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:05,165
What time did you get home?

385
00:27:05,999 --> 00:27:08,251
Last night? When did I come back?

386
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,671
You little… Did you drink again?

387
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,214
Drink?

388
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:17,635
I said I didn't want to drink, 
but Jin-su insisted

389
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,387
on pouring me a glass, so…

390
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,264
You didn't have to drink it though!

391
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,058
You knew you'd have a blackout.

392
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,687
Don't you ever drink again.

393
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:30,398
-I won't let it slide then. 
-Fine. I won't.

394
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,111
Hey, wait.

395
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,279
-What? 
-Wait.

396
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,239
What's this?

397
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,324
What?

398
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:41,451
Why is your forehead so red?

399
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:42,994
What's wrong with my forehead?

400
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:47,290
Is that a handprint? Did someone slap you?

401
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,249
No.

402
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,876
-You… 
-Not that I remember.

403
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:51,628
-God damn it. 
-What's wrong?

404
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,797
Who did this?

405
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,133
Who the hell left a handprint 
on my boy's forehead?

406
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,177
-It's okay. 
-Jeez.

407
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,428
It's okay.

408
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:02,389
-What the… 
-It's okay. It doesn't hurt.

409
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,599
-Don't worry about it. 
-This is upsetting.

410
00:28:04,682 --> 00:28:06,101
It's okay. Go now.

411
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,353
-Come on out. Breakfast is ready. 
-Okay.

412
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,481
Be quick. We need to treat that mark.

413
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,566
Fine. I just woke up, you know.

414
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:29,290
What?

415
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,459
She's right.

416
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,629
Who did this?

417
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,934
Good morning, Yu-gyeong.

418
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:50,729
Yu-gyeong.

419
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,732
What's wrong with your face?

420
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,400
What?

421
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,069
Didn't you sleep?

422
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:01,448
You look a bit ugly today.

423
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,824
What?

424
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,451
You look ugly.

425
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,341
Right? You do.

426
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,386
Did something happen 
with Baek-du yesterday?

427
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,221
What do you mean?

428
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,349
Who says I met him yesterday?

429
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,727
When he caused a ruckus here last night,

430
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:32,479
you took him somewhere.

431
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:34,647
Nothing happened!

432
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:39,110
What could happen between me and him?

433
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,654
You're talking nonsense again.

434
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:50,246
Why is she overreacting?

435
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:02,801
I look like a mess.

436
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,929
It's all because of Kim Baek-du.

437
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:18,191
And he wouldn't even remember it.

438
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,010
Hey, Oh Du-sik.

439
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,471
What was that face just now?

440
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:49,681
You must be crazy.

441
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,808
Snap out of it!

442
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,406
Jeez, she's aggressive.

443
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,401
I'm rich. I have a lot of money.

444
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:46,446
I'll treat you to something special today. 
Come follow me.

445
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,948
Something special in a supermarket?

446
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:52,660
Jeez, they're clinking so loudly.

447
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,996
Hold your pockets while you walk.

448
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:58,875
Did you receive the prize money in coins?

449
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,126
-What's that? 
-Hello, sir.

450
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,170
-The martial arts… 
-Hello?

451
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,255
Gosh, I'm tired.

452
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,924
-Hey, it's you guys. 
-Hello.

453
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,842
-Hello. 
-It's so hot.

454
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,093
It is so hot today.

455
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:12,013
Get the most expensive ones. 
You said it'd be special.

456
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,848
Gosh, what's the temperature today?

457
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,433
It's so hot.

458
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:18,019
-Here, sir. 
-Thanks.

459
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,063
Here. Take it.

460
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:20,980
Here.

461
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,608
-This is nice. 
-Hey.

462
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,443
This is something special?

463
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:27,654
-Is it? 
-Just eat it.

464
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,239
Jeez.

465
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,575
Still…

466
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:36,746
Our baby brother got us these ice pops 
with the prize money he won.

467
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,039
I'm so proud of you.

468
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:42,043
Listen, Baek-du. I watched your match.

469
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,045
-You seemed a bit different. 
-Right?

470
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,757
Well, somebody told me something recently 
and it opened my eyes.

471
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,884
Who is it? Your girlfriend?

472
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:52,679
Don't play dumb. I saw everything.

473
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:55,056
What do you mean? You saw what?

474
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:57,433
I don't exactly know 
what kind of relationship it is,

475
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,560
but there's something going on

476
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:01,896
between you and some lady, right?

477
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:03,815
So…

478
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:05,400
Right?

479
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,363
You know, that lady…

480
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:14,450
-The one in the light pink shirt. 
-What?

481
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:17,328
She had fluorescent floral arm warmers

482
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,914
and was sitting in the front row.

483
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,416
Wait, who?

484
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,042
-It's not her. 
-Who is it then?

485
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,211
It's the lady two people away from her.

486
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,964
She was wearing a sun hat, 
holding puffed rice, right?

487
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,549
What are you saying?

488
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,509
Jeez, that's just ridiculous.

489
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:34,095
There's no one. Cut it out.

490
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,973
Then why were you

491
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,933
winking and all?

492
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,854
-All in the middle of the match. 
-Well, that's…

493
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:44,939
That was for the fans. It's showmanship.

494
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,399
I always do that, so no!

495
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,609
-For the fans? 
-That can't be true.

496
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,695
You look happier these days.

497
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:53,531
You look jolly.

498
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:56,242
I can tell by the color of your face.

499
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:57,952
Be honest with me.

500
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,120
About what?

501
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,371
Are you dating someone?

502
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,792
That's nonsense. Listen.

503
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:07,295
Now is not a good time 
for me to be dating.

504
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,714
There's no good time to fall in love.

505
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,549
It happens before you know it.

506
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,636
Gosh, enough already.

507
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,221
I said it's nothing like that.

508
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,641
"Nothing"? There's definitely something!

509
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:23,394
Where are you going? 
It's time to have dinner!

510
00:34:23,478 --> 00:34:24,937
Hey, we have to eat dinner.

511
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,355
-What a liar. 
-Stop it.

512
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,648
There's something!

513
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:29,400
-Geum-gang. 
-Hey!

514
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:32,653
About what you just said…

515
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,698
What does it mean, 
it happens before you know it?

516
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,742
-Do you want to know? 
-Yes.

517
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,619
But this expression

518
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,456
has nothing to do with you, 
so don't worry about it.

519
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:45,124
Well, I want to know…

520
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,876
Just tell me!

521
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,673
All right, sit down. I won't yell.

522
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:55,301
-So… 
-Yeah.

523
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,428
It starts…

524
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,389
very sweetly.

525
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,017
It makes you excited

526
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,769
and anxious.

527
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:22,245
It makes you snoop around.

528
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:25,832
Because you want to see the person 
as often as possible.

529
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:43,349
And it's so upsetting 
when you can't see the person.

530
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:46,727
Sometimes, it even makes you want to cry.

531
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:18,384
But seeing the person makes you 
the happiest man in the world.

532
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,761
Love can make you

533
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:23,806
a complete fool.

534
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:41,199
I thought there'd be more records left 
on Uncle Cheol-yong.

535
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:46,787
But I was wrong.

536
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,583
-Du-sik! 
-Goodness.

537
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:55,296
What's he doing here? 
He doesn't have training today.

538
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,344
Du-sik! Hey!

539
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,055
Hey.

540
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,558
What are you doing here? 
You don't have training today.

541
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:09,018
Well…

542
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,479
It's boring at home. 
My brothers make fun of me.

543
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,356
I see.

544
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:17,735
So when are you off work? 
Are you almost done?

545
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,153
Yes.

546
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:22,240
-Why? 
-What do you mean, "why"?

547
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:25,159
We haven't walked home together 
in a while, so…

548
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,787
What?

549
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,164
-Is there something behind me? 
-No.

550
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,125
Then why do you keep looking at--

551
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,420
-What? Why? 
-Don't touch me!

552
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,172
What? Why?

553
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,132
You'll stretch my sweater.

554
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,678
Jeez, you're so cold.

555
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,304
I barely touched you.

556
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,431
-Just get out. 
-What?

557
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:50,184
-You really scared me. 
-Get out.

558
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,687
-Why? 
-Just get out.

559
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:55,898
I'm sorry.

560
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,942
Wait here.

561
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:01,362
I'll go bring my bag.

562
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,197
You want me to wait here?

563
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:14,000
Of course you don't feel awkward.

564
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,585
You don't remember anything.

565
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,391
Why did you leave 
in the middle of the match yesterday?

566
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:31,934
What?

567
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,354
You ignored my texts too. 
You even left me on read.

568
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:39,233
You see, leaving someone on read 
is basically a crime.

569
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,613
Guess where I placed yesterday.

570
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,700
I rocked yesterday. You know?

571
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,161
Guess where I placed?

572
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,245
-Four… 
-Fourth place.

573
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,458
It must be around fourth place.

574
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:58,294
Gosh, how did you know? 
Did somebody tell you?

575
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:02,006
Jeez, what do I do with you?

576
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:03,549
How did you guess that?

577
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:06,093
There's nothing I don't know about you.

578
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,970
I know you like the back of my hand.

579
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,182
Is that right? I knew it.

580
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:12,975
You're the best.

581
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,440
By the way,

582
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,109
a long time ago…

583
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,695
A long time ago, what?

584
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:28,783
Uncle Cheol-yong…

585
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:34,288
Uncle Cheol-yong? What about him?

586
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,333
Do you remember he had a daughter?

587
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,542
A daughter?

588
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:41,670
A daughter?

589
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:44,465
She was about two years younger than us.

590
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,176
She was a quiet girl with fair skin.

591
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,761
A quiet girl with fair skin?

592
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:55,393
We used to play together sometimes. 
Don't you remember?

593
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,019
No, I don't.

594
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,313
Who was that?

595
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,564
What's wrong with you?

596
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,983
How did you even recognize me?

597
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,320
Of course I recognize you. It's you.

598
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,657
How would I not recognize you?

599
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,075
Don't be silly.

600
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:15,913
Du-sik, wait up.

601
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:17,832
Du-sik.

602
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,711
Why did you ask 
about Cheol-yong's daughter?

603
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:28,217
Never mind. 
It's not like you could help me.

604
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:29,510
Come on.

605
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,638
You started it. Now spill.

606
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:33,597
Anyway,

607
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:37,560
do you really not remember anything 
after you drink?

608
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:38,811
Anything at all?

609
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:43,190
No, it's a complete blackout.

610
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,526
And when I open my eyes the next morning,

611
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:48,571
I see my mom looking down at me like this.

612
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,575
Are you pretending not to remember?

613
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:57,830
Didn't you say 
something like that last time?

614
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,123
I did? When?

615
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:02,251
When we were walking over there…

616
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:06,422
No, it was Mi-ran, not you.

617
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:08,132
-Mi-ran? 
-Yes.

618
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:10,801
The other day, 
Mi-ran and I were over there…

619
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,845
Was Du-sik your first love?

620
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:16,474
That night, 
you were calling out Du-sik's name

621
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,893
while walking over there alone. 
Don't you remember?

622
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,145
Over there, what?

623
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,689
Well, she…

624
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:27,401
Apparently, she heard me 
saying something when I was drunk.

625
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:29,737
She asked me if I remembered it.

626
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:30,905
I said I didn't,

627
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,656
and she said just what you said.

628
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,575
"Are you pretending you don't?"

629
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,452
What were you saying?

630
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:41,665
Well, I can't tell you that.

631
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,921
It's a secret. Top secret.

632
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,173
Even if you smack my head, I can't--

633
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,134
Jeez. Stop talking nonsense, will you?

634
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:56,388
Wait, hey.

635
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:58,516
By any chance,

636
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:02,102
did you smack me 
on the forehead yesterday?

637
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:05,147
You did, right?

638
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:07,233
That's why!

639
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:09,610
There was a handprint on my forehead!

640
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,780
So you remember?

641
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,114
Why did you hit me?

642
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:19,620
Because you deserved it.

643
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:23,582
Hey. You better be careful.

644
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:26,710
My mom was so angry this morning.

645
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,757
So is your memory like a broken TV?

646
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,511
When it's hit, it works sometimes?

647
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,346
What?

648
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:41,809
Are you going to hit me 
until I remember what happened?

649
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,187
Well, no.

650
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:48,065
Jeez, you're so scary.

651
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:51,610
I mean, if that's how it works,

652
00:42:51,694 --> 00:42:54,697
maybe you can remember 
what happened that day.

653
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,614
That day?

654
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:58,576
You know, 
the day you met Choi Chil-seong here.

655
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,287
Oh, that day.

656
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:03,038
But that's too long ago.

657
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,374
Somehow,

658
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,335
I feel like

659
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:15,593
there is an important clue here 
that I'm missing.

660
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,094
A clue?

661
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:20,472
It's just my gut feeling, though.

662
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:21,974
But you never know.

663
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:27,438
Wait.

664
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,315
Baek-du.

665
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,776
Try to recall what happened that day.

666
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:34,403
What?

667
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:37,489
Try to remember 
what happened here that day.

668
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,117
It's not as easy as you think.

669
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,120
I have never remembered anything 
from when I was drunk--

670
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,831
If you do, I'll grant you one wish.

671
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,002
-A wish? 
-Yes.

672
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,213
It doesn't have to be anything big.

673
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:56,300
If you can recall 
what exactly happened here that day,

674
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:59,053
I'll grant you one wish.

675
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:05,100
Really? One wish?

676
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:08,520
-Anything? 
-Yes, anything.

677
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:14,026
-Don't change your mind later. 
-Hey.

678
00:44:14,109 --> 00:44:16,236
I'm Oh Du-sik.

679
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:21,575
All right. I'll give it a try.

680
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:23,619
Good.

681
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:27,790
Right.

682
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:31,335
One thing, though.

683
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:36,382
You must remember 
what happened on that day only.

684
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,093
-Sure. 
-If you remember

685
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,720
some other things,

686
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,557
I'll kill you.

687
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:59,530
All right, Kim Baek-du, think.

688
00:45:00,489 --> 00:45:03,200
I had a glass of soju 
at Jin-su's Restaurant that day.

689
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,159
After that…

690
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,829
After that…

691
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,915
I locked eyes with Mom.

692
00:45:10,499 --> 00:45:12,543
No, don't be like this.

693
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:16,004
Kim Baek-du, don't skip the memories.

694
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,340
What Du-sik needs is 
the memories in between.

695
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:20,092
Think again, Kim Baek-du.

696
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,719
After that…

697
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,724
I locked eyes with Mom… Darn it.

698
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,686
This isn't easy.

699
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:35,065
Jin-su's Restaurant and then…

700
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:37,860
Are you going to blame me later 
for wasting your money?

701
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:38,777
No.

702
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:40,988
If eating that actually raised grades,

703
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:45,534
I would have made all my sons 
doctors, lawyers, prosecutors, and judges.

704
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:49,079
Two of them were successful. 
They were champions.

705
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:50,581
What are you saying?

706
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,458
-Mom, I'm here. 
-Where were you?

707
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:53,876
-Hello. 
-Hey.

708
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,588
You see,

709
00:45:57,671 --> 00:46:02,009
I'm just that desperate. 
I feel like I should do something.

710
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:04,219
You know the woman 
who sells dried seafood.

711
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:07,681
Her son was stupid until middle school,

712
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:10,225
but because he ate it regularly,

713
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:11,768
after he entered high school,

714
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:14,897
he had an improved memory 
and better focus.

715
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:18,692
In the end, he managed 
to get into a decent college.

716
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:21,153
Jeez, fine.

717
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:26,617
There's no reason for me not to sell it. 
But don't get your hopes too high.

718
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,869
-Fine. 
-Red ginseng isn't medicine.

719
00:46:28,952 --> 00:46:31,371
I hope it'll work like one.

720
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,081
Where did they place?

721
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:38,879
Don't be surprised. Out of 200 students, 
they placed 197th and 198th.

722
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,216
Hello.

723
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:47,387
I'm Meitori, your sleep assistant.

724
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:51,350
Today, we will proceed

725
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:55,896
with a sleep-inducing video 
that can evoke memories

726
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:01,193
from your subconscious 
in the process of falling asleep.

727
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:05,739
Now, relax your body

728
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:07,991
and lie down.

729
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:11,078
And shift

730
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:14,540
your focus to your body.

731
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,512
Baek-du!

732
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:31,557
What's that?

733
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,141
Is that tonic?

734
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,102
Can I try it? Just one sip.

735
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,399
That was so mean.

736
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,818
-That was a cheap move. 
-It's not tonic.

737
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:45,070
It's red ginseng. It makes you smart.

738
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:46,863
Red ginseng?

739
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,032
Are you going to college?

740
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:52,995
Wait. I want to be smart too. 
Let me try a sip.

741
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,162
Is it in your pocket?

742
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,081
I don't even have enough for myself.

743
00:47:56,164 --> 00:47:59,126
-You got some on your hand. 
-Don't be so greedy.

744
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,795
Don't you worry about my health 
as a friend?

745
00:48:01,878 --> 00:48:03,964
Here. Eat what's on my face then.

746
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,924
No, not like that.

747
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:08,385
Wait, I can think more clearly now.

748
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:10,721
Do you think you've become smarter now?

749
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:16,351
You're good today.

750
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:34,578
Coach Kwak.

751
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:35,996
Yes.

752
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,750
Does Baek-du seem different to you too?

753
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:44,087
What? How did you do it?

754
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:48,342
It's my secret move. I can't teach you.

755
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,927
Come on. Teach me.

756
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:53,347
-No. 
-Come on. Please.

757
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,433
-Do you really want me to? 
-Please.

758
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:57,392
Come here.

759
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:00,854
-Use the centrifugal force. 
-Okay.

760
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,105
-First, pull. 
-Okay.

761
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:04,149
Then, lower your body and push here.

762
00:49:04,232 --> 00:49:06,234
-With the right hand? 
-Yes. Push it.

763
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,153
Push…

764
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,200
Baek-du, what's with the intense gaze?

765
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:16,828
What's with the cheesy gaze?

766
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:19,915
Jeez.

767
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:21,375
What was that?

768
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,211
What was that?

769
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:26,171
What was it?

770
00:49:41,103 --> 00:49:42,229
Was it a dream?

771
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:47,567
But it feels too vivid to be a dream.

772
00:50:15,637 --> 00:50:17,347
So…

773
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,224
Heading home?

774
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:20,892
Yeah.

775
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:22,769
I should.

776
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:29,317
What is it? You're spacing out again.

777
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,071
You see, I…

778
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,991
I remember something…

779
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:38,326
-Something-- 
-Hey, you're dripping water.

780
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,997
Jeez.

781
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,042
Don't you know how to dry your hair?

782
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:01,016
It's really dusty.

783
00:51:01,099 --> 00:51:02,142
Why is it so dusty?

784
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:08,315
-Du-sik. 
-Yes?

785
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:11,610
I remembered something.

786
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,196
Really? You remembered it?

787
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:15,530
No, not that.

788
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:20,327
But I'm not sure if I'm remembering 
something that actually happened

789
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:23,538
or some kind of a dream. I'm confused.

790
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:24,956
What is it? Tell me.

791
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,919
No, never mind.

792
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:32,631
It must be just a dream. 
It didn't happen for real.

793
00:51:32,714 --> 00:51:33,965
-What is it? 
-Never mind.

794
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:36,843
You're making me curious. Just tell me.

795
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,388
-Do you want to hear it? 
-Yeah.

796
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,141
-It's just a dream, so… 
-Sure.

797
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:45,060
Okay. I'll tell you.

798
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:48,104
In my dream, you took me somewhere.

799
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:49,231
Somewhere secluded.

800
00:51:49,314 --> 00:51:50,273
What?

801
00:51:50,357 --> 00:51:52,317
Yes. And then,

802
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:54,277
the two of us sat somewhere

803
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:56,321
and talked about stuff.

804
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:58,740
What was it? Rice cake skewers?

805
00:51:58,824 --> 00:52:00,909
Yeah. I think it was rice cake skewers.

806
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,160
-Right. 
-What skewers?

807
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:05,038
Then things got… How can I put it?

808
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:07,249
Things got kind of intimate.

809
00:52:07,332 --> 00:52:10,794
Then one thing led to another, 
I was a little…

810
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:14,005
Well, it's just a dream, okay?

811
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,799
It's just a dream.

812
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:18,760
Even I'm embarrassed 
that I had this absurd dream.

813
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,428
Anyway, I went like…

814
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,183
I kissed you.

815
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:26,685
So I'm confused.

816
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:29,813
Our relationship is nothing like that,

817
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:32,566
so this dream confuses me.

818
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:33,942
Was it maybe not a dream?

819
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,036
What?

820
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:53,587
What is wrong with him?

821
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,798
Why did he have to remember 
that useless memory?

822
00:52:58,884 --> 00:52:59,759
Actually, no.

823
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:03,680
It was crazy of me 
to ask him to try and remember.

824
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,181
It's my fault.

825
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:20,363
-That was a great meal. Let's go. 
-Okay.

826
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,573
-Hey. 
-Ms. Lim.

827
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:23,617
-Goodness. 
-I really enjoyed the food.

828
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:25,744
Gosh, thank you so much.

829
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:29,372
-Have a good day. 
-You too. Thank you.

830
00:53:29,456 --> 00:53:30,874
-That was great. 
-Come again.

831
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:31,791
Will do.

832
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:33,460
Oh, boy.

833
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,004
Jeez.

834
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:40,091
What is he doing?

835
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:42,135
Why isn't he finished yet?

836
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,597
The soup is getting cold!

837
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,098
Right.

838
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,267
It'll get frozen at this rate.

839
00:53:51,645 --> 00:53:52,896
How annoying.

840
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:01,154
What?

841
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,200
Where's she going with that bag?

842
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:15,710
I can't hear you. Speak up.

843
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:18,254
I said that I can't at the moment.

844
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,548
I'm following that woman 
named Mi-ran right now.

845
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:22,509
Yes.

846
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:24,010
She's…

847
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:28,181
All right.

848
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,269
She's heading somewhere with a big bag.

849
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:34,938
Yes.

850
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:37,816
No, I don't know that.

851
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:40,819
She's heading towards the market now.

852
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:03,174
So that's why…

853
00:55:04,092 --> 00:55:07,429
That's why she said she'd kill me 
if I remembered other things.

854
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:09,014
Darn it.

855
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:16,646
But why didn't she kill me that night?

856
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:20,233
We were in a secluded place 
so late at night.

857
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:22,569
She could've easily killed me.

858
00:55:46,092 --> 00:55:47,594
-Bye. 
-Goodbye.

859
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,678
-Hey, Uk. 
-Hi.

860
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,305
Uk is here. Hey.

861
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:52,057
Come and sit here for a minute.

862
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:53,475
I'm a bit busy right now.

863
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:55,268
Come on. You're unemployed.

864
00:55:55,351 --> 00:55:57,604
They say unemployed people die 
from overworking.

865
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,606
Ladies, now is really not a good time.

866
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:02,358
Uk, you said you were 
a pretty smart student.

867
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,444
Were you the top student in school?

868
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:05,528
Yes, always.

869
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:06,571
-Really? 
-Wow.

870
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:09,032
Could you help my kids with their studies?

871
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:12,494
Their grades have been so bad lately 
that I can't even sleep at night.

872
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:13,912
Okay. I will help them.

873
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:15,371
-Okay. Bye. 
-Wait!

874
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,873
We need a pinky promise.

875
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,084
Pinky promise.

876
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:23,088
Help my kid too. Pinky promise.

877
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,172
You promised!

878
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,591
This Uk is totally different 
from the other Uk.

879
00:56:28,551 --> 00:56:30,678
Darn it, where did she go?

880
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:45,819
Excuse me.

881
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:53,910
You missed her?

882
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:57,122
Where are you now?

883
00:56:57,997 --> 00:56:58,832
Right now?

884
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:00,542
I'm in…

885
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,336
Yu-gyeong, I've got to go now.

886
00:57:03,419 --> 00:57:05,880
Wait. Where are you now?

887
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:07,757
What…

888
00:57:14,139 --> 00:57:16,015
Jeez, alcohol is scary.

889
00:57:16,641 --> 00:57:19,435
How did I do that? 
That was so fearless of me.

890
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,857
How am I supposed to see her again?

891
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,317
I'm just too embarrassed to see her.

892
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,239
Right. The wish.

893
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:35,076
I should tell her 
that my wish is to let this slide.

894
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,912
All right. Kim Baek-du, you can do it.

895
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:41,374
You can remember it. Now, remember.

896
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,599
Man.

897
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,726
It's getting more and more vivid.

898
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,061
Snap out of it.

899
00:58:02,687 --> 00:58:06,900
The first time was hard, but the second 
and third time will be easy.

900
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:09,194
-Did you watch Supernova Flashman? 
-What?

901
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:11,654
Yes, I did.

902
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:16,242
Compared to having 
some alien villains destroy the buildings

903
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,621
and fighting them off all the time, 
it's not so bad

904
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:22,165
working in a quiet village like this.

905
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,168
But you know what?

906
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:28,213
Even if alien villains invaded Geosan,

907
00:58:28,296 --> 00:58:29,714
we would have nothing to do.

908
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,091
Thanks to the Geosan Flashmen.

909
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:36,513
All the champions here 
will team up to fight them,

910
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,849
and meanwhile, we'll be chasing Snowball.

911
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,894
That night, I had a drink at the reunion.

912
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:48,066
And I was walking down here.

913
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:52,654
Isn't that…

914
00:58:52,737 --> 00:58:55,073
What's he doing there?

915
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:57,992
And I was yelling Du-sik's name.

916
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,203
Then…

917
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:01,913
Right.

918
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:06,960
A black car rushed towards me and…

919
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,050
What's he doing? Does he see a ghost?

920
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,678
After that…

921
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:24,686
What is this?

922
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,316
What is he looking at?

923
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:32,110
Is he looking at us?

924
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,240
Why is he lying down?

925
00:59:37,991 --> 00:59:39,409
It must be hot.

926
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:50,003
Kim Baek-du, what are you doing? 
Have you gone crazy or something?

927
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:06,060
Then the man walked up to me

928
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:08,855
while I was lying down.

929
01:00:09,439 --> 01:00:10,398
Like this…

930
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:12,734
Is he acting? What's wrong with him?

931
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:13,651
He's kicking.

932
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:15,695
Is it heat stroke?

933
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:18,489
Then I was like, "Ouch," and…

934
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:20,825
-What… 
-Is he crazy?

935
01:00:20,908 --> 01:00:23,328
He's lying down again. 
It must be really hot.

936
01:00:23,411 --> 01:00:26,039
Then I opened my eyes and saw his face.

937
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:35,548
Right, it's that man. The 40,000-won man.

938
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:37,467
Then, I…

939
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,677
"Sir, take this 40,000 won!"

940
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,596
-Jeez. This is bad. 
-Then he hit me.

941
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:43,806
What's he doing? 
Is he acting out something?

942
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,224
Then I fell down.

943
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:48,436
So I picked up the 40,000 won.

944
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:50,271
Maybe he's seeking a career change.

945
01:00:50,355 --> 01:00:52,148
"Sir, please take this."

946
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:55,360
Then he hit me again. 
So I tried one last time and…

947
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:00,823
What's your friend doing?

948
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:04,035
He's not my friend. I don't know him.

949
01:01:13,461 --> 01:01:15,046
Wait.

950
01:01:15,129 --> 01:01:18,549
You need to take this 40,000 won.

951
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:23,971
Keeping this would make me feel guilty.

952
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:29,894
And there was someone

953
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,938
in the passenger seat.

954
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,023
Who was it?

955
01:01:50,123 --> 01:01:52,625
Kim Baek-du, where are you going?

956
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:54,627
Hey.

957
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:01,467
The person you're calling 
is unavailable at the moment.

958
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:06,013
He could've at least told me where he was.

959
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:17,650
Du-sik.

960
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:19,485
Du-sik.

961
01:02:31,789 --> 01:02:32,832
Du-sik!

962
01:02:41,674 --> 01:02:44,135
Du-sik! Hey!

963
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,095
Du-sik, hurry.

964
01:02:46,179 --> 01:02:47,638
What now?

965
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:50,600
Gosh, I'm tired.

966
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:53,436
What?

967
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:54,812
Hey.

968
01:02:54,896 --> 01:02:57,064
I remembered.

969
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:58,274
Remember what?

970
01:02:58,357 --> 01:03:00,026
That night…

971
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:03,446
That night on the coastal road…

972
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:07,200
I remember that car… I…

973
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,744
Calm down and tell me.

974
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:14,081
That night, in that car…

975
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:17,210
In the man's car,

976
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:20,254
someone was in the passenger seat.

977
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:21,589
It was…

978
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,721
Who was it? Me?

979
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:34,310
You said you didn't remember,

980
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:36,729
but you remember everything.

981
01:03:38,981 --> 01:03:42,026
I guess I don't need to hide anything now.

982
01:03:44,237 --> 01:03:47,114
Shall we talk?

983
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:03,548
LIKE FLOWERS IN SAND

984
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:31,200
Du-sik, did you really come back 
to Geosan because of that?

985
01:04:31,284 --> 01:04:34,495
-Is she the girl you saw at the terminal? 
-Yes, I'm sure.

986
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:35,580
Don't be ridiculous.

987
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:38,875
There's something going on 
between Baek-du and that married woman?

988
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:40,293
He said to meet him there.

989
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,628
Why hasn't she come to work yet?

990
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:45,798
People might find this suspicious.

991
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,884
Did you hear anything else?

992
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:49,594
Technically, I killed him.

993
01:04:49,677 --> 01:04:51,178
The person who killed your dad

994
01:04:52,555 --> 01:04:53,931
is in this town.

995
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:57,810
