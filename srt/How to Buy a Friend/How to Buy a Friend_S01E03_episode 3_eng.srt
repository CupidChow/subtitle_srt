1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,780

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,980
Let me just ask you one question.

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,190
You were a loanshark and gangster.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,680
How did you get all the way up to city commissioner?

5
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,620
In the countryside,

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,290
what would politicians who have nothing else but time do?

7
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:21,900
You should know it well.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,490
If I knew, I'd be more than...

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,930
Not those girls who pretend to be innocent.

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,830
I need a real one.

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:33,570
A real young one who knows nothing.

12
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,550

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,780

14
00:00:53,650 --> 00:00:58,180

15
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:07,240

16
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:28,140

17
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,120
By poetic license such as seen here,

18
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,000
we mean a deviation from the rule, conventional form or logical,

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,470
for the effect of the poem.

20
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,450
Breach of grammar or comparisons that are allowed...

21
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,190
 Kim Dae Yong is already too much for me.

22
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:46,840
 To add Heo Don Hyuk, too?

23
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,490
 I'm clearly cursed.

24
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:54,140
 How do you know that line?

25
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:55,620
 What line?

26
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,890
 "Wet sand remembers footsteps."

27
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,210
 How do you know that, I mean!

28
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,200
 I heard it from that Big Sis.

29
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,740
 Can you prove it?

30
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,480
 I really did. I clearly heard it then.

31
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,760
 If you're lying, I'm going to really kill you.

32
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:20,690
 At the given time...

33
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,560
 Student, you can't get on it.

34
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,750
 It's dangerous, so please come down.

35
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,810
In order to cover one's immaturity,

36
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,280
if you try to use poetic license randomly,

37
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,260
there will be a price to pay.

38
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,880
 Meet me after school. Somewhere quiet.

39
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:43,620
 These types all like the word "quiet."

40
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,580
 For example, "be quiet."

41
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,940
 Or "Stay quiet before I chop your brain."

42
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,760
Hey, Author Park. Let's talk, somewhere quiet.

43
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,150
I don't want to!

44
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,190
What?

45
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,950
Oh, nothing.

46
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,220
What did Teacher say? You need to keep writing.

47
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,720
I'm not getting any inspiration.

48
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,850
That inspiration never comes easily. I told you many times.

49
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,910
What's with your face?

50
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,070
Oh right. I've got wisdom tooth.

51
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,990
You'll need to pull out the wisdom tooth.

52
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,130
Oh right. Use that. Wisdom tooth.

53
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,650
- Write about the wisdom tooth. 
- What?

54
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,910
One week's time. Okay?

55
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,120
- Okay? 
- Okay.

56
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,210
It's one week.

57
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:38,570
- Teacher. I have something to discuss with you about writing. 
- Okay, go ahead.

58
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:42,080
This isn't the place. Somewhere quiet.

59
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,550
Then do you want to have dinner with me?

60
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:46,390
Yes, I'd love to.

61
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,380
Oh, Teacher.

62
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:51,400
Where are you going?

63
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,360
I thought I'd have dinner with Se Yoon to discuss her future school.

64
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:58,770
Oh, what a coincidence! I'm getting ready to have dinner with Author Park, too.

65
00:03:58,770 --> 00:04:02,150
Should we eat together? Yesterday's warrior united.

66
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,680
Oh sure. Should we?

67
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,890
It's all right, right? Since you know each other.

68
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:09,000
Yes, I'm fine.

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,370
Author Park?

70
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,650
 I'm a ninja who cannot hide his body.

71
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:18,690
- What? 
- Oh, I totally forgot.

72
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:22,870
I'm supposed to go somewhere with Heo Don Hyuk today.

73
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:24,390
You can't postpone it?

74
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,490
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,630
Hurry and come.

76
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,240
Yep.

77
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:08,760
 Hey, where are you?

78
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,350
 I saw Iron Man dragging you somewhere. Text me if anything happens.

79
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,390
 If it's dangerous, just text anything.

80
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,780
Come in. I live alone.

81
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,500
Alone?

82
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,580
 It's cold.

83
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,350
I guess sound travels here.

84
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:12,760
We can hear noise from other rooms. Right?

85
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:17,680
 Dear, Sir nextdoor, may you please hear my scream.

86
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,700
 "Wet sand remembers footsteps."

87
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:23,460
 "Wet sand remembers footsteps."

88
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:30,250
 Shin Seo Jung's boyfriend that King-Psy talked about... it's Heo Don Hyuk?

89
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,790
Sit.

90
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,700
 From now on, when I watch movies, I think I can understand what perpetrators feel.

91
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,560
Talk.

92
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,000
Everything you remember.

93
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,850
That day, so it was...

94
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,250
 Kyung Pyo hid my phone so I was going around looking for it.

95
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,480
 And that Big Sis was at the staircase.

96
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,920
 Sorry, by chance...

97
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,950
And what else?

98
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,910
 White sneakers that were getting dirty.

99
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,580
 And a pink cellphone.

100
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,480
Cellphone?

101
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,490
She had a cellphone then?

102
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,160
Iron Man.

103
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,010
I think it had an iron man figure on it.

104
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,670
Anything else?

105
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,390
Well...

106
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:13,490
That day, I was hit by a hit-and-run car,

107
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,070
so my memory is a mess.

108
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,930
It's true. Believe me.

109
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:21,180
 Student! You're inside, right?

110
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,470
 Student!

111
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,570
Hey, Student.

112
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:34,540
I barely make a living collecting rent, too.

113
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,270
This is really hard on me.

114
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,720
I'm sorry. I'll try to put it together somehow.

115
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,430
- But...
- Excuse me.

116
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,510
Would this by chance...

117
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,540
This will do. See you around.

118
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:58,080
Hey.

119
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:01,580
Why would you pay that?

120
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,010
If it wasn't you, it would be taken by Kim Dae Yong anyway.

121
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:11,900
In exchange, can you just let me go?

122
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:17,140
Let me go. I don't want to get mixed in these kinds of things.

123
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,360
Park Chan Hong!

124
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,460
The line you wrote.

125
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,550
It was the last line Seo Jung texted me.

126
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:38,590
Before Seo Jung died,

127
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,170
there were some strange pictures circulating around school. You know about them, right?

128
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,870
Yeah, I heard about it recently.

129
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,530
He took pictures like that,

130
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:52,320
and sent them to me on purpose too, some bastard.

131
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,820
 Oh, the kid that died after falling from the rooftop?

132
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,990
 She was done with.

133
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,580
 Some boy was right by her tight.

134
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,330
 - So the rumor that she was dragged around was true?
- Yep.

135
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,100
 She was done for totally.

136
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:13,700
 I should have met her.

137
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,000
 Talk! Talk!

138
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,830
 You really saw them?

139
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,550
 Who was Seo Jung with?

140
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,770
 For real!

141
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:24,680
 She was with a guy who had a tattoo on his ankle.

142
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,140
 A tattoo.

143
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:29,900
 He had a joker tattoo.

144
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:34,680
There was no phone with Seo Jung's dead body.

145
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:38,260
I'm also wondering if that jerk is the one who hid it.

146
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:41,710
And you might be the last person to see her phone.

147
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,170
Let's make a deal. I mean, like a contract.

148
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:50,060
A contract?

149
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:53,390
 Heo Don Hyuk asks for help in a unique way.

150
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:55,020
I'm not asking you to help me for no reason.

151
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,760
Kim Dae Yong will not give up,

152
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,330
and he'll keep on troubling Uhm Se Yoon.

153
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:03,490
Just remember anything, whatever it is and I'll block it all.

154
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,700
 It's an offer I want to jump at.

155
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:10,790
 But...  I really want to help, but...

156
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:17,860
I can't remember, I'm sincerely sorry.

157
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:37,360

158
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:42,720
Jerk.

159
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:55,810
Se Yoon, you believe me, right?

160
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:59,450
I really didn't do anything like the rumors said.

161
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,680
Yes, I believe you.

162
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,480
Thanks. I'm really grateful. As expected, I have no one but you—

163
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:13,830
Why... can't you meet my eyes?

164
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:37,200

165
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,110

166
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:58,150
 Did you look that way?

167
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:09,760
♫  If you hear this song   ♫

168
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:16,150
♫  Keep your eyes wide open  ♫

169
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,960
Why did I come here?

170
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:51,160
Pathetic fool.

171
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,280
 I am a ferry and you are a passerby.

172
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,610
 If you do not come,

173
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:21,510
 I will be blown on by wind and drenched in the rain.

174
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:27,800
 From night till morning,  I await fo you.

175
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:37,370
 However, I know you will come eventually.

176
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:25,700

177
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,450

178
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:33,430

179
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,440

180
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:52,430
Maybe God's helping us. They're taking the bait.

181
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:55,260
Sangpil sure did a good job with the phrase.

182
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:58,360
It just makes you want to click, right?

183
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,900
The location is tagged.

184
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:10,140
Only seven Jaeil highschoolers live there.

185
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,930
I'll take care of it as fast as I can.

186
00:16:13,930 --> 00:16:18,410
Who would've thought that cunning one recorded it amid all that?

187
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:47,590
Hey, Ninja, good to see you alive!

188
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:49,450
You should get lost.

189
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:51,410
Why did you just ignore my texts and shit yesterday?

190
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,290
Your bro worried so much about you.

191
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:58,010
Oh, Ironman is more merciful than I thought.

192
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:00,590
Ah, please! My head hurts so badly.

193
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,860
What exactly is the matter? Tell me.

194
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,020
Do you know how this bro can handle it?

195
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,940
Because I pity you. First Kim Dae Yong, then Heo Don Hyuk.

196
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,760
Hey, am I your friend?

197
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,370
Sorry.

198
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,020
I have something I need your advice on.

199
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,580
Before that, I think you should pray first, to stay alive.

200
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:29,480
I'm leaving because I think it's bad luck to stay with you.

201
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,030
Today, we will talk about the process of establishment.

202
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,510
 I told myself many times.

203
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:42,700
 If Se Yoon would forgive me just once,

204
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,380
 that I would not back down ever again.

205
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:49,970
 That without Heo Don Hyuk's help, I can still get it done,

206
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:53,960
 and that vow collapsed thoroughly.

207
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,720
I don't know why that bastard's watching out for you.

208
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:01,170
You're dead if you think you can be a brat because of that.

209
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,160
Bastard!

210
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,510
I'm going to take care of Heo Don Hyuk soon.

211
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:17,680
But we have to settle what's between you and me first, especially about Uhm Se Yoon.

212
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,820
 I am limp.

213
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,180
 I am filthy and cowardly.

214
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,940
What's there to think about? It's a jackpot of a dashing idea!

215
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,090
Ironman as Ninja's bodyguard! Tada!

216
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:47,910
My memory is a mess so I don't really have anything to make a deal with.

217
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:52,220
The secret message with the boyfriend.

218
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,480
Hey, look at the goosebumps!

219
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:04,370
I'll need some clues though to find the disappeared cellphone.

220
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:09,230
Choi Mira, you dropped something.

221
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:13,080
Some charm!

222
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,570
Hey, Psycho, are you going to creep me out again?

223
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:20,430
I really don't want to mix words with you but I will say a few.

224
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,690
Yep, go ahead.

225
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:25,440
You are bad at studying and bad at sports, and you don't look good either.

226
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,070
But on top of that, you talk really tacky.

227
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:30,590
What exactly are you even good at?

228
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:36,280
Mira, how much time do I have to answer you?

229
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,540
How annoying! Get out of my way.

230
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,430
Let's go, Se Yoon.

231
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:46,540
What should we call this? So haughty.

232
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,250
That haughty lump!

233
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,940
Ninja.

234
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:06,920
I really don't know.

235
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:10,200
What did I ever do wrong to get this, on this radiant spring day?

236
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:16,180
Hey, King-Psycho! If only you didn't hide my phone as a joke that day, this wouldn't have happened to me.

237
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,510
What? When you see the storm, you blame the butterfly for having wings?

238
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:23,530
Oppa, stop blaming others and make that brain work again.

239
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,420
Jeez.

240
00:20:29,890 --> 00:20:34,660
What the fuck is with the racing at a place where the future generation are trying to bloom?

241
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:40,200
Oh, I remember!

242
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,220
- The cigarette bud. 
- What?

243
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,830
You know the day Shin Seo Jung died.

244
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:48,560
I tried to hide to startle you near the school like this.

245
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:52,300
That hit-and-run car threw a cigarette bud out and took off.

246
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,430
What did you see that day?

247
00:20:58,830 --> 00:21:01,290
Hello. I'm Oh Kyung Pyo.

248
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:04,590
What a great coincidence to see you here on a day off.

249
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,900
You go.

250
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,040
Say again what you saw in detail.

251
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,880
Well,

252
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:37,540
so that's all I saw, Big Bro.

253
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,330
It's really true, Bro Don Hyuk.

254
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:42,540
I know I look like this, but I'm really good-natured.

255
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,890
Please believe me.

256
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,590
Okay.

257
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,090
Why aren't you eating?

258
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:59,010
Eat. You can eat and talk.

259
00:21:59,010 --> 00:22:02,690
Really? Hyung, really? I can eat it?

260
00:22:05,870 --> 00:22:08,640
And you can lower your speech. I'm just an early birthday.

261
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,400
Bro, I have a late birthday so I can call you "bro."

262
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,370
Hey, you're a May birthday though.

263
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:15,420
Yep, late May.

264
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:19,210
Bro Don Hyuk, I love that you're my big bro.

265
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:22,230
You haven't changed your mind?

266
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:25,560
Actually, I don't really want to be mixed up with you,

267
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,880
and I don't remember anything either.

268
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:32,020
All right.

269
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,820
Hey, why are you using casual speech with him, idiot?

270
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:35,480
You're the idiot.

271
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,350
You're not scared?

272
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:42,570
   -

273
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:48,490
When the second-hand makes a circle and covers 12,

274
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:51,120
you will go back to a year ago.

275
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,060
Does this really actually work?

276
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,390
Why this extreme anyway?

277
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,530
Focus on the clock.

278
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,770
We have to remember if we both want to live.

279
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:03,400
I brought alive the mood with the tall candles and you're going to kill that off?

280
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,990
This isn't just your problem anymore.

281
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:09,350
Focus.

282
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,790
When the second-hand reaches 12.

283
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:18,890
Your eyes close automatically.

284
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,650
Five.

285
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:25,460
Four.

286
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,250
Three.

287
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,460
Two.

288
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:53,210
Hey. Now.

289
00:23:55,070 --> 00:24:00,760
Now you're laying on the green grass field.

290
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,600
Now more inside.

291
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:16,160
More inside, into the deep deep.

292
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,250
Now,

293
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:20,300
- a year ago. 
 - Where did he throw my cellphone?

294
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,060
- We're going to that day. 
 - This is crazy.

295
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,580
What is being said?

296
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,510
 By chance,

297
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,860
 have you seen a cellphone around here?

298
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,260
 There's a ninja drawing on the case.

299
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:42,490
 I haven't.

300
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:45,500
 Yes, thank you.

301
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,440
 Wait.

302
00:25:02,770 --> 00:25:09,210
Seo Jung speaks about grass and trees.

303
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,270
She's worried about me.

304
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,810
She said she would look for the cellphone with me.

305
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,550
Asking where.

306
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:24,790
By chance, is there no one else around you?

307
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,760
There's a noise from the back.

308
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,650
Let's go. To see who's there.

309
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:43,960
It's dark suddenly. I can't see anything.

310
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:49,320
Here, more inside.

311
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,720
Deeper. Your mind. Deep inside your mind.

312
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,210
Now the darkness is going.

313
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:01,870
Who is there?

314
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:29,440
I like you.

315
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:33,030
What?

316
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:36,500
I really like you.

317
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,590
I like you as much as space.

318
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,050
As much as the many stars.

319
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,920
Who?

320
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,130
- Hey. 
-  Son.

321
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:51,810
I like you.

322
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,700
 We're home.

323
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,060
Hey! Hey!

324
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,470
Park Chan Hong.

325
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:58,570
Park Chan Hong.

326
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:01,400
Park Chan Hong.

327
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:03,790
Hey! Hey!

328
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,170
Hurry and wake up!

329
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:08,480
No one's out there.

330
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,750
What the? Who are you?

331
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:14,450
I'm Kyung Pyo.

332
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:19,430
But? What's with all these candles, and what are you doing?

333
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:21,600
Well, I don't know where to start.

334
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,970
I like him.

335
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:26,640
What?

336
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,690
Hey, you rascal!

337
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,300
Is this New York?

338
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:41,380
- What is this? 
- It's not that!

339
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,570

340
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,370

341
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:56,460

342
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,590
Which bastard took it?

343
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,490
To hide what?

344
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,710
You're all from Jaeil High, right?

345
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,710
 Yes!

346
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:20,630
I need you guys to look into a few kids. You don't need to know why.

347
00:28:20,630 --> 00:28:23,660
If you see one of them with a pink cellphone, call me right away.

348
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,480
 Yes!

349
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,170

350
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,250
Hello.

351
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,880
Welcome. Come in, please.

352
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:56,670

353
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,960
Please take your time looking around.

354
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,290

355
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:20,200
Once upon a time, I had dreamed of becoming an artist, too.

356
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,100
Maybe that's why I'm so drawn to this.

357
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,560
I see.

358
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:29,300
Please continue to grow your business big and help us artists.

359
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:33,680
As I do this and that, all sorts of business, I hear lots too.

360
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,650
Maybe it was about a year ago?

361
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:40,090
Someone here with a regrettable...

362
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:44,050
Well...

363
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,930
My friends.
