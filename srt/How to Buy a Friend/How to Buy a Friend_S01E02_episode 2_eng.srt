1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,810

That statement...

2
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:07,660
"Wet sand remembers the footsteps."

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,680
Are those your thoughts?

4
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:16,290
Probably since I wrote it.

5
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:18,290
Is it weird?

6
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,480
No, it's just fascinating.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,470
What?

8
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:27,350
Let's acknowledge each other from now on.

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,020
This-- This isn't mine—

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:37,420
I'll see you around.

11
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:46,130

12
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,660
I'm back.

13
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,150
Yeah, okay.

14
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,990
Go inside and rest.

15
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,860
Yes, yes. No, don't worry about it.

16
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,590
Yes.

17
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:22,660
President, thank you for caring.

18
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:24,390
Okay.

19
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,270
Why are you just standing there! Hurry and go study!

20
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,350

21
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,380
"Excellence Award.

22
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:47,290
Uhm Se Yoon.

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,860
Congratulations."

24
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:59,520
Park Chan Hong, become a great poet!

25
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,750
I will support you!

26
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,760
What do you mean, "support."

27
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,690
I've heard poets nowadays starve to death.

28
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:11,700
Write something else rather than poetry. Something like plays.

29
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,860
What could you possibly do with poetry?

30
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:15,660
Look at her. She's ruining the mood again.

31
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,760
How could you compare a playwright and a poet?

32
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,620
I'm not ruining the mood...

33
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:23,000
- He could write dramas. 
 -  Do what?

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,880
It'd be great if he writes a movie or something.

35
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,740
  I'm about to start a romance.

36
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:45,100
It's fascinating to me, too. How did that happen?

37
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,010
Could I be a genius?

38
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:00,620
 As a talent, I didn't even know of showed itself.

39
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:03,400
 The whole world vibrated.

40
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:21,350
  Se Yoon found me easily.

41
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:27,580
 I couldn't hide myself anymore.

42
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:38,030
 Like that, at 19, our spring was starting.

43
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,980
 The spring that never forgave anything for passing by.

44
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:49,330
 The spring that brings out the things hidden within us.

45
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:55,290
 The spring that urges us to sprout.

46
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:49,360

47
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,340

48
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,880

49
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,590

50
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,580

51
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:18,430

52
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,270
Sister Soo Jung birthday?

53
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,550

54
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,000
  /i&gt;

55
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:42,080

56
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,050

57
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,180
 [Hurry or send money now,

58
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:51,280
 or I'm circulating this.]

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,720
  ♫ Help me--me if you hear this sou-sou-sound ♫

60
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,870
  ♫ Keep your eyes wide open and look arou--rou--round ♫

61
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,470
 The spring that tells us to forget winter,

62
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,130
 that violent spring had started.

63
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,310
Wow! He's big. No wonder he's Iron Man!

64
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:45,110
- Shut your mouth! 
 - Gosh, seriously.

65
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:47,270
It's ominous.

66
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,160
Ominous.

67
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,470
Who's contact are you waiting for?

68
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,880
What do you mean, "waiting for."

69
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,660
Anyway, it's ominous.

70
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:01,610
For the first time in our lives, we're in separate rooms. Isn't it ominous?

71
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,580
Why would that be ominous? It'd be a GREAT thing.

72
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,880
- Get out of my face, Room 2. 
- Die, Room 4.

73
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,440
- Move out of my way! I need to go that way! 
 - Gosh!

74
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,140
Welcome. This way.

75
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,830
We are really grateful you will sponsor our school.

76
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,000
It's nothing.

77
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:31,890
It's this way.

78
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,340
  Is there something wrong?

79
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,020
 I'm in the same class as him, of all people.

80
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,700
I heard you can write poetry. Excellence Award, Park Chan Hong.

81
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:26,270
Nice to meet you. I'm Kim Dae Yong. You know me, right?

82
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,700
Yes, I know you.

83
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:35,850
Heo Don Hyuk, what a thug he is.

84
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:39,040
If he's at school, he should hurry and arrive.

85
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,650
He has no manners.

86
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,280
I think this is my seat.

87
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:58,400
Taking your time on the first day.

88
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:01,120
You put on some air.

89
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:07,340
You're only one year ahead. Don't act like your our big brother.

90
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,120
Got it?

91
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,640
I have an early birthday.

92
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,380
What?

93
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:22,110
I mean you can talk casually to me since I'm born in the same year as you. Take good care of me.

94
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,970
We'll see.

95
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,020
Sure. Let me know when you're done talking.

96
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:48,380
Hey, Park Chan Hong, let's go to the student store.

97
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,230
I'll buy.

98
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:52,390
Hey, Ahn Sung Do!

99
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,560

100
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,800
It's ₩7,000. (about $7 USD)

101
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:42,290
All right. I'll knock that off your interest. You can go.

102
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,320
 Interest?

103
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,130
Ah, oh, thank you.

104
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,700
I'll go upstairs then.

105
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,760
Eat. I chose the most popular things at the market.

106
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,340
Thanks. I'll eat it well.

107
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:05,410
Park Chan Hong, you're close with Uhm Se Yoon, I heard.

108
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:10,120
Me? No, we just went to the competition together last time.

109
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,860
We just know each other.

110
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:16,280
What do you mean just a little? You two have been going around together for days now.

111
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,040
Are you guys dating?

112
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,240
No! Me? Who would I date?

113
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,300
Really?

114
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,440
Then, can you introduce me to her?

115
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,260
This kind of thing all comes down to timing.

116
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:34,160
But I hate waiting for things.

117
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:39,970
Oh, okay.

118
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,270
(- Who is he?) 
 (- What?)

119
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,490
(Come out.)

120
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,770
(Help.  Help)

121
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:56,530
Hey, Ninja. You said you were going to come over yesterday but you didn't.

122
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,590
Yeah, I fell asleep early.

123
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,840
It was a total mess without you.

124
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,780
Right, I have something to tell you. Can you come here for a second?

125
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,370
Hey.

126
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,170
Do you want to die?

127
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,740
What?

128
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,560
Hey, bastard, I'm talking to him right now.

129
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,930
"Talking about."

130
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,030
Sorry. Let's talk later.

131
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,850
Continue talking.

132
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:32,030
Then, you're going to introduce me to Uhm Se Yoon.

133
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,550
Is there anything else you want to eat? I'll buy them all for you.

134
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:42,380
Do you want this? This?

135
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,610
 Look how he's scared.

136
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,860
 Hey, stand.

137
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,240
 Chan Hong, do you have time later in the evening?

138
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,120
I wonder if this ever happened to you, too.

139
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:27,220
I saw something scary, but

140
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:33,160
if I pretend I don't know, it could pass by as if nothing happened.

141
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:40,210
It's something that won't change even if I act like I knew about it,

142
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:43,170
it's scary and I want to avoid it.

143
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,680
You know that kind of thing.

144
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:54,810
What would you do if there was something like that?

145
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,590
Would it be right to fight it even if it's scary, or

146
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:05,650
would it be right to let something that passed pass?

147
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,080
If it were me,

148
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:16,290
I would like it if you didn't get hurt.

149
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,710
I'm not sure what it is/

150
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:26,560
But whatever it is, I hope it'll make you happier.

151
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,300
You said it's not like the result will change.

152
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:33,960
Would that be it?

153
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:37,690
 I want to be happier, too.

154
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:42,210
  I don't want to introduce you...

155
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:46,220
Park Chan Hong, you're really smart.

156
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,190
Oh, well.

157
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,300
Hey!

158
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,000
Hey, do I seem happy to you?

159
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,660
It wasn't like that!

160
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,200
Right?

161
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:32,040
No, someone said they saw you guys at the pizza shop together.

162
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,710
I doubt you saw me as an idiot.

163
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,510
I'll give you time until this afternoon.

164
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:45,370
If you ignore me again,

165
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:48,160
I'll make sure you shit your pants just looking at school.

166
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:03,980
 Today at 7:00 at the cafe downtown.

167
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:07,560
If nothing happens today either, you're dead.

168
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,080
Se Yoon.

169
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:27,400
No, don't come here. Go to the pizza shop.

170
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:30,170
Hey! What is it?

171
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:32,840
Why are you asking to meet at a place like this?

172
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:36,090
Right. It isn't nice, right? Let's leave.

173
00:16:36,090 --> 00:16:39,700
Are you okay? What's wrong with your face?

174
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,760
Did something happen?

175
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:45,020
No. It's nothing. Let's leave first.

176
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:49,560
Okay, I had something to tell you, too.

177
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,910
Park Chan Hong?

178
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,800
Yep, Kim Dae Yong.

179
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:05,830
I heard you guys were close. Did you come here after studying together?

180
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:10,100
Actually, Chan Hong kept telling me he was going to introduce you to me.

181
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:12,770
I didn't think we'd meet like this.

182
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:19,490
You should've told me ahead of time! I would've cared more about my appearance!

183
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,810
What kind of place is this?

184
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,210
Anyway, sorry.

185
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,080
It's because he hasn't dated before.

186
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:30,090
Right. It must be because he's been single all his life.

187
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:35,200

188
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,850
I think you have a call. You should go and take it.

189
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,030
I'll take this call for just a bit.

190
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:54,950
Do you want to sit here for a second?

191
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:09,090
Mom, what?

192
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:13,510
 What do you mean what? You asked me to call on time!

193
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,820
 Mom said to come home quickly, so

194
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,240
 I need to go.

195
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,410
 I'll see you tomorrow.

196
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,880
 I think it's hard to be average, too.

197
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:16,460
 I don't think I'm even average.

198
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,510
I'm home.

199
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,270
Oh, you're here? Did you eat?

200
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,960
I ate.

201
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,240
Park Chan Hong, let me see your face.

202
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,220
Take off your hood.

203
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,150
Why? It's nothing.

204
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:46,040
Hey, Park Chan Hong, you're not going to tell me?

205
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,120
What happened to make your face like this?

206
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,610
I said it's nothing!

207
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,420
You--You--Come out here.

208
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:01,150
What are you going to do in there?

209
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,400
Let's leave him alone.

210
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,320
Let's act like we don't know.

211
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:12,480
Oh my god.

212
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,640

213
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,240
It's not like we're dating. Why the heck am I crying?

214
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,810
♫   It was a day that the wind blew strongly   ♫

215
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:20,630
♫   She waved her small hands   ♫

216
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:26,680
♫   Putting on an awkward smile   ♫

217
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:31,390
♫   She saw me crying   ♫

218
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:37,970
♫   However, I could not hold onto her   ♫

219
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:43,370
♫   Though I regret it now   ♫

220
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:49,110
♫   As I watched her getting far away   ♫

221
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:54,510
♫   I felt fear, too   ♫

222
00:21:54,510 --> 00:22:00,010
♫   My heart ached   ♫

223
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:05,530
♫   I also cried as I felt myself   ♫

224
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:11,110
♫   all alone now   ♫

225
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:15,620
♫   Though my longing to see you was endless   ♫

226
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:21,520
♫   I didn't have one ripped up picture of you   ♫

227
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,410

228
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,480
There's that one girl that died last year.

229
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:41,900
Her phone. Where is it?

230
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,640
Hey!

231
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:50,840
Wow, this bastard. You have this much cash?

232
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,390
Stop. It's my tutoring fee!

233
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:03,980
This bastard. Who pays their tutoring fee with cash?

234
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,540
I heard your dad runs a business. Did you steal from him?

235
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,680
I think so.

236
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,850

237
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:26,490

238
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:32,670

239
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,270

240
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:47,700

241
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:57,440

242
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,860
 Wet sand remembers footprints...

243
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:07,140

244
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,430
Stop that already.

245
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:22,820
  This afternoon, a high school female student's deceased body was discovered.

246
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,430
 The police has started an investigation.

247
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,700
 According to Kangpo North District Police Precinct, around 4:10 this afternoon,

248
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:33,310
  a student, Miss A, was discovered to have collapsed in a flower bed at school in the Kangpo district.

249
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:36,830
  It was reported that the teachers discovered her.

250
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:39,510
 The teachers and students who discovered Miss A called the police,

251
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:41,940
 and emergency services and the police were dispatched.

252
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:45,040
  But she was already deceased.

253
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:48,370
  There were no personal items such as a cellphone or a will near her.

254
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,900
  This is an announcement broadcast.

255
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,130
  Today after lunch,

256
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:56,290
  we will have an all-school training.

257
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:59,750
  All students are to report to the school courtyard.

258
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:02,510
  I will repeat the announcement.

259
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:06,260
You fucked with me about introducing Uhm Se Yoon to me.

260
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:09,620
What do you mean? How did I fuck with you?

261
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,820
You're lying till the end, you fucking moron?

262
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:17,180
Grab him.

263
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,650
You want to die? Hurry and grab him.

264
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,470
What is it?

265
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:31,550
No, nothing much.

266
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:34,270
I'd like you to give us some space for a little bit.

267
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:41,640
I read the poem he wrote earlier and I was too touched.

268
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,810
I really want to tell him about my reaction.

269
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,400
Hey, are you joking right now?

270
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:57,290
I have something to ask you about the poem.

271
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,180
"Wet sand remembers footsteps."

272
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,610
Was that your idea?

273
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:10,920
Tell me straight.

274
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:15,330
Is it really all your idea?

275
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:18,660
Yea, probably.

276
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:25,310
If you need my help, say the weather is really great,

277
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:28,360
or you can just continue and get beat here.

278
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,440
But you have to pay me back, too.

279
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,470
Think about it well.

280
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:40,280
I'm done. Thanks for giving me the time.

281
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:05,800
 Do you know why soil freezes tight in the winter?

282
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:11,440
  It's because the kids who are supposed to sprout in  the spring are holding onto their water tight.

283
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:19,810
  Wet sand remembers footsteps.

284
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:24,120
The weather is really great!

285
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:00,620
Thanks, for real.

286
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,630
Nah, no need to thank me.

287
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,520
You need to pay back, too, since you agreed.

288
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,630
Yeah. What do I need to do?

289
00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:10,290
- Just tell me, I'll-- 
- Jump off.

290
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,530
What?

291
00:28:21,570 --> 00:28:26,520
- Why are you doing this?
- You know her, right? The girl who died here a year ago.

292
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,810
Hey.

293
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,400
Did you kill Shin Seo Jung?

294
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,840
  I shouldn't have written that fucking poem.

295
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:48,540

296
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,010

297
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:54,360

298
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,310

299
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,750
  Our spring started.

300
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:18,480
 Spring that doesn't forgive all those that are dying.

301
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:23,820
 Spring that unveils those that are hidden in the snow.

302
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:30,140
  Spring that urges them to sprout.

303
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,100
  The cruel spring.

304
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,370

305
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:42,120

306
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:47,140

307
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:51,570

308
00:29:51,570 --> 00:29:53,800

309
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:01,150

310
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:06,050

311
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:15,140

312
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,800

313
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,870
