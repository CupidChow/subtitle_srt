1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:07,940

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:12,630
 This was left by Shin Seo Jung on a condition-meeting site.

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,470
 She didn't write it.

4
00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:16,770
 How is it not, rascal?

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,510
 I even verified the IP address.

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,990
 The picture is the real thing, too.

7
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:26,990
-  I told the kids that work under me... 
- That's enough.

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:30,660
 Look at the way you look. Can I actually stop here?

9
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,020
 Don Hyuk, wake up!

10
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,300
 Just acknowledge that she's just that kind of a girl, you idiot.

11
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,330
 - Hey!
- What do you know about Seo Jung?

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,910
 Don't ever come again. It makes me regret I thought you were a friend.

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,200
 Fine. Let's never see each other again.

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,220

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,790

My account got hacked.

16
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:03,310
 Yes, yes.

17
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:05,900
They just showed up and beat me without checking first.

18
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,690
You already said that earlier.

19
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,420
Wait.

20
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,760
Hurry and give us your mother's contact number.

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,290
Huh?

22
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,540
So stubborn.

23
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,370
Chan Hong. Park Chan Hong.

24
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:29,130
There.

25
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,400
You're working hard.

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,000
- Are you all right?
- What is this happening? Let me see your face.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,360
- It's roughed up bad. 
- Park Chan Hong!

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,830
Are you nuts? Why are you doing something you never did.

29
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:46,600
Did he do it with you?

30
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,340
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,960
Are you the parents?

32
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,520
Can you hurry and settle this?

33
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:02,540
I don't have time. Hurry, please.

34
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:06,400
Sir, what do we do about the kids?

35
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,130
Your son was the one beaten so you can just sign on the document and take him with you.

36
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,610
But this buddy is the issue.

37
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,600
Someone needs to come and settle or something.

38
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,480
Since he's got a juvenile record, too, this might get big.

39
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,710
Your friend?

40
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,660
Any bones broken?

41
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,740
Thank you. I make this request.

42
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,900
Thank you for being generous. We will teach them well.

43
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,650
It's not for fashion.

44
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:48,360
I got it. I got it.

45
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,920
You're going to freeze to death trying to look cool.

46
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,360
I'll make you a jacket, okay?

47
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,860
Don't worry. I'll get fabric and make it for you. You wait.

48
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:01,830

49
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:13,050

50
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,100
You should sleepover.

51
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:20,180
You had a hard day.

52
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,390
I'm all right.

53
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:24,180
Don't decline it.

54
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:28,380
I won't be scolding someone's precious son anyway.

55
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,690
I'm really all right.

56
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,740
I'll make sure to pay back the settlement compensation.

57
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,050
Just eat at least.

58
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:40,350
What do you like?

59
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:49,490
Eat lots. I didn't prepare too much since I didn't have time.

60
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:54,020
It'll be some big uproar if she had time then.

61
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:58,580
You come often then so I get to eat well on your part.

62
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:08,890
The soup is so good. You still got it, Madam Oh.

63
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:15,040
Eat lots even if it doesn't suit your taste buds.

64
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,060
You'll get scolded here if you don't finish your food.

65
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,120
Why aren't you eating the tofu fritters?

66
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,960
Mom! I told you I don't like stuff with beans in them. You know that.

67
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,750
Whoever raised him, our son is sure nicely raised.

68
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,130
Who says to eat them for taste!

69
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,170
Eat, Son.

70
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,380
Oh, but you're wearing white.

71
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:52,930
Oh, jeez.

72
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,170
Let me see.

73
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,070
Oh, you rascal.

74
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,720
It's all right. He's going to sleep soon anyway.

75
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:03,490
When are you going to be an adult, huh?

76
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,040
Look at him. Look how adult-like.

77
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,230
Dependable.

78
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:14,150
Stop saying "adult" so much. It stresses out the adult who's hearing it.

79
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:19,140
Also, where are the adults these days anyway? Everyone just pretends to put on the air of an adult.

80
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,830
Right?

81
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:26,160
Choong Jae, please at least put on airs properly.
 (T/N: act better than one really is)

82
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,450
This is a bit salty, Son.

83
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,050
It's true. It's salty.

84
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:33,220
Really? Then don't eat it.

85
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,810
And you eat it all.

86
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:38,430
The meat's probably salty, too.

87
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:43,160
You don't touch it. You eat it all.

88
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:47,580
It's fine if you eat it with rice. It's not that salty.

89
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:50,360
Let's eat.

90
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,440
- Wow, the seasoning is perfect.
- Don't worry and you eat it all.

91
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:59,220
Eat up. And come often. This is great with you here.

92
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:01,930
 Traitor. You fled by yourself?

93
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,270
 Hey, one person should survive to report it.

94
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,030
 How did it go?

95
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:11,460
 Heo Don Hyuk is at my house. My dad and mom keep telling him to sleepover.

96
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,610
 What? You're together at home?

97
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,970
 Yup. It looks like he's really going to sleepover.

98
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:18,660
 Can you come over now?

99
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:21,180
 Your message could not be sent.

100
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,800
 Hey, are you joking?

101
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,440
 Your message could not be sent.

102
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,590
This psycho bastard.

103
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,080
 Chan Hong!

104
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,400
You said you're not going to wear this, right?

105
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,780
Yeah, the size isn't right.

106
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,050
I thought you'd grow bigger.

107
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,410
 Even if I am bigger, I wouldn't wear this.

108
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:48,740
I cut the fabric out and made it myself. It's pretty, right?

109
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,930
- Yes. 
- I used mother-of-pearl buttons.

110
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:59,280
So just be at ease, like you're at home and sleep.

111
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:02,420
You sleep well, too, Son.

112
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,390
- You, too, Mom.
- Yep.

113
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,250
I'll close up the door for you.

114
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,890
I told you I'd kill you for real if you lied, right?

115
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,380
I'm sorry. I really had a reason.

116
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,950
How did you end up with it?

117
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,170
Was it fun toying with me?

118
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,510
Se Yoon...

119
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,380
She gave it to Se Yoon.

120
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,500
Uhm Se Yoon? Seo Jung gave it to Uhm Se Yoon?

121
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,370
I forgot.

122
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:56,930
I think about here should do.

123
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,430
Yep. Right.

124
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,040
This.

125
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,970
I saw on "Morning Plaza"

126
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:17,610
that it's good to eat kiwi before you go to sleep.

127
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:20,130
So...

128
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:27,530
Well, it might be an unfamiliar place to sleep.

129
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:31,650
But sleep comfortably. Are you learning something?

130
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,750
Yep.

131
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:37,610
Oh, all right.

132
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,550
Sleep well.

133
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,430
Dear Jung Ae.

134
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,440
You had a worrying day.

135
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:06,890
I don't want to worry.

136
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:09,570
But I keep worrying.

137
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:17,460
But I think it was a good idea to bring him here. Right?

138
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,040
Yep, it was.

139
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:26,390
But why did he go to juvenile detention?

140
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:31,310
He's respectful to adults.

141
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,800
I think he must have had a reason.

142
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:57,940
Se Yoon didn't hide it on purpose, either.

143
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,470
She said she left it in Se Yoon's locker.

144
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,730
That big sis did.

145
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:06,530
Why?

146
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:10,370
No one knows that, of course. Why that line,

147
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,090
she to you, to me,

148
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:15,490
and to Se Yoon, too.

149
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,450
Like no one knows why she left that line to us.

150
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,590
Se Yoon struggled a lot, too, I think.

151
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,530
She probably felt like she resented her.

152
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,110
That's the scariest part.

153
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,790
Are you leaving?

154
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,790
Oh, did you sleep well?

155
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:12,860
Yep. I'm glad to see you.

156
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:15,420
Stay there for a second.

157
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:21,700
Chan Hong, let's go to the bath house.

158
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:30,740
♫  My youthful days that have passed  ♫

159
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:37,680
♫  I dreamed a sweet dream of flying off on a balloon  ♫

160
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:44,250
♫  When the yellow balloon flies to the sky,  ♫

161
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:52,260
♫  Beautiful memories build in my heart, too   ♫

162
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,070
Over Three. Oh Kyung Pyo.

163
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:01,690
Take your mark.

164
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:08,570
♫  that small dream  ♫

165
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:25,070
You know you have a way of making people feel pathetic sometimes.

166
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,290
You ran off!

167
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,500
Bro Don Hyuk, your skin's so nice, too.

168
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,590
Hey, but if I reported later, you would've been beaten up bad.

169
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:39,520
I mean them. Not you. I'm worried about them.

170
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,590
I was afraid they were going to die by Ironman's punch.

171
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,190
I  might puke.

172
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:57,140
Look at your dead skin cells and dirt. You're an eraser.

173
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:00,820
Take some home later. I'll wrap it nicely for you.

174
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,420
That's refreshing. Dad's leaving first to work.

175
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,970
- Bye. 
- See you again.

176
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,650
Oh. This is from Mom.

177
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:25,710
Tell them I said thanks.

178
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,940
Here. Bro Don Hyuk is "venti."

179
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:34,510
Ninja, you get "tall" and me, "grande."

180
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:37,280
Hey, but I'm taller than you.

181
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:39,360
Who's talking about height?

182
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,980
Indeed, my bro.

183
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,250
Cover up.

184
00:13:58,180 --> 00:14:00,940
 Cadence.

185
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,170
 Words that suit each other.

186
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,210
Their chemistry.

187
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:09,740
When the sight of me disgusts you and you leave.

188
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:15,290
I shall without a word let you leave.

189
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,460
Seven, five. Seven, five.

190
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,170
There's a cadence to the poem.

191
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:25,250
You guys, too. If you repeatedly write poems,

192
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,710
you will develop cadence.

193
00:14:27,710 --> 00:14:31,970
Your own rhythm is created.

194
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,300
 It's like a dead end then.

195
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:38,060
 - Is there a way? 
- If you get used to this breathing pattern.

196
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,060
It sets in and you can't even change it.

197
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:44,760
 There are a few points in the chatting content that stand out.

198
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,110
The cadence is created. It's amazing, right?

199
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:57,020
Hello. Um, yesterday.

200
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,460
Oh, you runaways.

201
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:05,170
Go make the world clean and come back.

202
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,580
Jeez. Go.

203
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,160
Wait! Look.

204
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,060
This is complete clashing sounds. But watch.

205
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:19,640
They are creating a sublime cadence.

206
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,400
Things that don't match in their small ways,

207
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,950
can create a sublime cadence, too.

208
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:32,160
So he stole someone else's picture to act like that person.

209
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,490
But their faces are different.

210
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,250
She would've been on guard.

211
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,590
That's simple though.

212
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,990
 You are supposed to meet Hyeon Goo, right?

213
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:49,160
 Ah, yes. Are you the friend he mentioned?

214
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:52,060
 - Yes, we're classmates.
- So he must have looked like a nice person.

215
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,090
 But she seemed to be a bit drunk.

216
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:59,120
 Seo Jung can't drink. They probably drugged her.

217
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:03,510
 Drink this while you wait. Hyeon Goo should be here soon.

218
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,540
 Yes, thank you.

219
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:13,900
 They took pictures and extorted her for money.

220
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,580
We need to catch that bastard.

221
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:22,230
Where would high school students get money? How did your big sis do it?

222
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,880
If it were me, I would've done anything for money. Don't you think?

223
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,930
Let's split up to clean.

224
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:38,310
- Bro Don Hyuk, you rest up. Ninja and I will take care of it.
 - Can you please?

225
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,070
What?

226
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,930
The truth is...

227
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,880
there's something bothering me.

228
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,600
It's about what Seo Jeong put on the internet.

229
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,470
I kept thinking she hadn't written it,

230
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:19,070
but the ID and IP address are the same.

231
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:22,580
If she really...

232
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:28,840
- I mean, if she really did... 
 - She didn't.

233
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:34,880
She is someone Se Yoon wanted to be like.

234
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,600
You liked her, too.

235
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:43,680
Don Hyuk, she didn't write it.

236
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:07,070
You haven't come to the tutoring center lately. Is something the matter?

237
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:11,280
No. Nothing.

238
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,420
That's good then. I was worried

239
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,750
something happened because of what I gave you.

240
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:26,270
Don't worry. I'm holding onto it well.

241
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:31,270
Come to the tutoring center for sure today. See you there.

242
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,120
Se Yoon.

243
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,500
- For a while, I won't be coming to the center.
- Why?

244
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:42,030
 Because I don't have money. Money.

245
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:44,640
 And I'll be beaten to death if my mom finds out.

246
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,330
You're going to officially write?

247
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,810
- No, not that.
- What do you mean not?

248
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:54,460
Oh, Park Chan Hong, that's quite dashing.

249
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:57,610
I'm cheering you on. Write well.

250
00:18:57,610 --> 00:18:59,180
Bye.

251
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:07,630
You're getting better by the day.  Indigo comes from blue but is more vivid!   (T/N: The student is surpassing the master)

252
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:09,770
Do you know what the most startling part is?

253
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:12,850
Even if I cover your name and read this,

254
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:16,440
I can feel the rhythm that can only be Park Chan Hong's.

255
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,670
It's really great.

256
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,860
I'll keep this for now.

257
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,290
Here.

258
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,470
You knew her, right? Shin Seo Jung.

259
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:34,060
Yes.

260
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:38,620
Seo Jung was a beautiful writer, too.

261
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:43,820
Want to read it once?

262
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:46,310
 Full of romance and innocence,

263
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,700
 that child who smiled lovely,

264
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:55,320
 that child who pouted easily but laughed easily,

265
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,760
 as though he had a three-year-old child in him,

266
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:02,380
 that child who is shriveled up.

267
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,950
 He does not know...

268
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,000
 that his back that is shriveled up,

269
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,600
 just how lonesome it looks.

270
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,160
 He doesn't know.

271
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,930
 His eyes strained to keep open,

272
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,920
 how sad they are.

273
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:29,110
 That child...

274
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,310
 does not know.

275
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,520
 He doesn't know.

276
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,130
 He doesn't know.

277
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:46,560

278
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,240
What is this?

279
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,340
Chan Hong?

280
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,680
Hey, what is it?

281
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:37,770
Hey, that thing! Where is it?

282
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:40,320
What thing? What are you talking about?

283
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,650
Park Chan Hong, what are you looking for?

284
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,720
That dating bulletin.

285
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,610
Bis Sis didn't write it.

286
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,950
What?

287
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,350

288
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:07,620
The points our teacher always stressed.

289
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,890
 Take out the "And" in these sentences.

290
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:14,520
 These transition words make your essay terrible. Get rid of them.

291
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,660
Also, the spelling.

292
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,250
Gold... for some reason... will.

293
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:23,170
Big Sis had perfect spelling.

294
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:25,090
 Short phrases are remarked phrases. There's a saying

295
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,170
 that you have to be as simple as possible.

296
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:32,000
Big Sis wouldn't have made the sentence this long.

297
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,660
She adds a lot of commas as her sentences get longer.

298
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,360
There were none in this post.

299
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:46,900
But this was an informal post on the inter—

300
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,280
This is the crucial factor.

301
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,130
 I am doing this because...

302
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,700
 "Reason" and "because" are alike.

303
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:57,230
 Only use one.

304
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,980

305
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,730

306
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,790
It's obvious.

307
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:10,100
Someone else wrote this bulletin message,

308
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:14,940
and Big Sis didn't write this post.

309
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,410
One more thing.

310
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,660
Here.

311
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,240
It seemed to be about you.

312
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,990

313
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:40,170

314
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,210
 How heavy must the weight on his shoulders be? He doesn't know.

315
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,530
It's pretty cool out here.

316
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:41,140
Go get your coat.

317
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,860
I'll take you home.

318
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:47,120
Okay, thanks. Step away from the door.

319
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,700
Wow, this is super fast!

320
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,280
- Hold on! 
 - Okay!

321
00:24:56,980 --> 00:25:00,940
Anyway, are you going the right away?

322
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:03,500
You want to get off?

323
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,230
I'm good.

324
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,290
Se Yoon!

325
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,660
I'm coming!

326
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:14,050
- That's right! 
 - Se Yoon!

327
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,100
Thanks, man.

328
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,050
How do I get this off?

329
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,680
Let go.

330
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,810
Thanks. Bye.

331
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,990
Park Chan Hong!

332
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,830
Thanks. For real.

333
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,010
Hello?

334
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,690
I found it.

335
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,510
Are you sure?

336
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,650
Okay.

337
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,030
I said I got it, so hang up.

338
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:38,990
♫  When I turn around you are always   ♫

339
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:45,020
 Don Hyuk, can't you just trust me? I didn't write that.

340
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:50,590
 Who wrote everything then?

341
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:56,450
 Seo Jeong, I don't care about this stuff. It's fine.

342
00:27:56,450 --> 00:28:01,940
 I just... I just want to hear the truth!

343
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,450
♫  to you  ♫

344
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,260
♫  I will give   ♫

345
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,260
 I just...

346
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,250
 need your trust.

347
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,240
 I don't care about anyone else.

348
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,460
♫  I will give you my shoulder   ♫

349
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,500
♫  I saw you in my dream  ♫

350
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:29,770
♫  holding hands as flowers blossom  ♫

351
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:32,460
♫  walking with me  ♫

352
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,490
♫  I saw you in my dream  ♫

353
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:41,810
♫  that the smiles of ours  ♫

354
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:45,400
♫  would leave, we did not know  ♫

355
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:54,510
 Seo Jeong, I will find it.

356
00:28:55,990 --> 00:29:00,760
 I'll find the people who did that to you.

357
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:09,530
I said I wanted to keep drawing, and he got really mad.

358
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,880
That's why I'm wearing these.

359
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:17,150
Anyway, Park Chan Hong is amazing.

360
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,200
I found the courage after seeing you write.

361
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:24,950
I'm already wavering.

362
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:33,040
Still, I won't give up.

363
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,100
Never.

364
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,500
You're not going to tell me to stay strong?

365
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:44,940
Yeah. Stay strong.

366
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,590
What a soulless answer.

367
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,460
That's not it. You're staying strong right now,

368
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,860
so you could stop being strong.

369
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:03,930
I just... like it when you're happy.

370
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,790
My dad's here.

371
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:20,400
