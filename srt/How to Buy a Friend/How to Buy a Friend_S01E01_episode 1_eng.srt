1
00:00:05,510 --> 00:00:08,470
 Why the heck am I sitting in some place like this?

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,270
 Where the hell did it all go wrong?

3
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,000

4
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,720
 Tada. The 10 vs. 1 legend.

5
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,080
 The heroic death.

6
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,870
 But I thought you were good at fighting. Iron man!

7
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,460
 What a joke.

8
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:54,480

9
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,180
Before your face is ruined more, let's hurry and hand it over.

10
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,970
You can't!

11
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,640
Or your friend's going to die, I said.

12
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,580
 We're not friends. We're in a contract, you know.

13
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:38,890
 Heo Don Hyuk, I shouldn't have mixed with you.

14
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,340
 He's really pissing me off.

15
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,980
 No.

16
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:16,450
 The reason we're on this fucking shitty mountain...

17
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:23,620
Wet sand remembers footprints.

18
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,470
What?

19
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,900

20
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,650
 Yeah, I shouldn't have written stuff like poetry.

21
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:21,600
 Everything started from that fucking poem.

22
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,820
Mom!

23
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,740

- Mom! Mom!

24
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,130
 Yeah?

25
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:35,250
Why didn't you wake me up?

26
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,800
What? But you're on school break.

27
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,020
Ack, but it's registration today.

28
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,910
Oh, I forgot.

29
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:45,750
What about tutoring center tuition? Did you deposit it?

30
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,960
Wow, isn't this seriously too much?

31
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,850
What's seriously too much is your report card!

32
00:03:52,850 --> 00:03:56,420
You're a high school senior in one month, so how are you so at peace, I wonder.

33
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,710
Stop nagging the kid.

34
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:03,200
Son, eat before you go.

35
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,110
I'm late though.

36
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,700
Since you're late already, what's a little bit later?

37
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,920
Just do passable. Somewhere in the middle is good enough.

38
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,500
Yeah, just be passable like your dad; just a little like that.

39
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:18,940
Oh jeez!  How can a person only look up in life?

40
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:22,490
At times you should look below you, too, like how water flows.

41
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:23,720
I'm going.

42
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,680
Eat before you go though.

43
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,040
Your water is overflowing, overflowing!

44
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:33,170
I told you not to put this here on the dining table.

45
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:36,060
There's no place to put it.

46
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,030
Or throw it away.

47
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:49,220

♫  It feels good to ride in the train toward the world  ♫

48
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:55,890
♫  My heart regrets having to leave without you  ♫

49
00:04:55,890 --> 00:05:03,410
♫  But I have to leave now  ♫

50
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:06,970
 My dad's words that one can't just live looking up.

51
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,700
 That's a truth I realized early on.

52
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:14,110
♫  You're leaving and I have to leave, too  ♫

53
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:18,140
 Somewhere along the line, being average became my goal.

54
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,920
 Is this why?

55
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,640
 My height, my weight, and even my grades.

56
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,850
 Exactly average for an eighteen-year-old.

57
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,790
 It's Uhm Se Yoon.

58
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,980
 Jaeil High School's #1 best looking.

59
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:38,470
 And her grades are top-ranked, too, at that.

60
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,710
 Someone difficult to mix a word with.

61
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:48,680
 Would she know a human being like me even exists?

62
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:59,740
 So dear youth, rip up the likes of ambition and throw it on the back mountain.

63
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,980
 So the wild animals can chew it up and eat it.

64
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,560
 This very common-looking face.

65
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,140
  Did you bring it? Hey, that looks good.

66
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,240
 Colorless, odorless, meaningless. Is it the benefit of being that?

67
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,620
 At least I won't become a prey.

68
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:20,770
 For this reason, my nickname is...

69
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:21,990
 Ninja.

70
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:25,740
 Someone whose location is hard to fathom no matter where.

71
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,000
- Hey, you psycho bastard!
 - Ninja!

72
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,140
Boys class separate and girls class separate. How is this a co-ed school then?

73
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,080
- We should be mixed and rubbed together. 
- Mix or rub, you'd be in separate trash collection right away.

74
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,200
That's true. I'm too unique in a mix.

75
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,840
Ninja! Follow your master!

76
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,740

77
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,150
What exactly is a poet?

78
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,900
Someone who can see the world differently.

79
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,550
A different point of view, I mean.

80
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,040
When everyone in the world looks at this mud

81
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,980
and says it's dirty and stinky and puts on an offended look.

82
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,760
 Language and Lit teacher, Woo Tae Jung. 
Nickname, "Spitting Woo".

83
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:11,280
The dirty flower that blooms from the dirty mud.

84
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,510
It stinks.

85
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,770
It's dirty. It's ugly!

86
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,300
 He's a poetry fanatic so he goes nuts when poetry is discussed.

87
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,910
The one who fathoms it. That person is the true poet.

88
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:32,140
Well, that is what I think. Are you ready to fathom the truth?

89
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,100
Yes.

90
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,930
Start.

91
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,090
This is to pick out who represents our school so if you do it haphazardly,

92
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:43,710
you will be punished rightfully so.

93
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:47,110
If you're done writing it, you can leave first.

94
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,150
 More so than fish in a fish tank...

95
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,410
Hey, are you crazy? That's a song lyric.

96
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,670
Hey, old farts don't know who Beenzino is.

97
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,530
I'm going to finish quickly and go eat.

98
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,510
You just pick whatever something to write, too.

99
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,680
Today's lunch menu? Knock, knock: pork cutlet and spicy meat.

100
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,910
Then, I'm going to go with E Sens.

101
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,470
Tidy decision! Good!

102
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:27,820
 After time passes...

103
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:33,500
Who is chuckling?

104
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:38,340
Are you all done or what?

105
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:46,040
More so than the fish confined in a fish tank, perhaps I...

106
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,260
am more foolish.

107
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,640
Our Kyung Po is that way actually, so it's self-awareness.

108
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,040
I like how honest it is. Passed.

109
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,560
 (Oh yeah!)

110
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,990
What did we just see?

111
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:42,700
Is the rumor really true?

112
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,030
What rumor?

113
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:47,620
You know, Shin Seo Jung. The senior that committed suicide a year ago.

114
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,850
The one that fell into the flower bed over there and died.

115
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:54,070
You know, the day you had that accident that day.

116
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:05,030
 The school was flipped upside down.

117
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,280
 You probably can't remember since you were in an accident.

118
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,180
 But right before she died, she did something scandalous or something.

119
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,560
 There was a lot of talk.

120
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,290
 I think some strange pictures went around, too.

121
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,880
 What?  No way.

122
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,450

123
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:21,450
 That's too pitiful. To commit suicide over bad grades.

124
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,120
 I'd never die over stuff like that.

125
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,170
Bad grades? That's just what the cops roughly said.

126
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,770
Since the cops didn't find her cellphone.

127
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:33,450
Why not? Probably because she hid it or got rid of it before dying.

128
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,710
Why would she hide it?

129
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:40,360
Rumors said Uhm Se Yoon and the dead Shin Seo Jung had that kind of a relationship.

130
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,360
- Like they kissed and stuff. 
- Hey, stop talking nonsense.

131
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,670
Hey, why would she date a girl and you know Uhm Se Yoon...

132
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,310
Hey, why are you getting all worked up and shit?

133
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,340
Oh, but Chan Hong!

134
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,380
What? Why? Did I say something wrong?

135
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,660
Pizza bar. They're going to run out.

136
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,530
Hey.

137
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,790
Someone so pretty like her just won't get a boyfriend. Does that make any sense?

138
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,160
So those two were in love?

139
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,350
Bingo, but Shin Seo Jung started to date a guy so the two cracked!

140
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,130
- Choi Mira, what? 
- Hey, King-Psy (King Psychopath)

141
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,620
Are you a pervert? Why are you peeping?

142
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,510
I wasn't looking at you and I'm definitely not a pervert.

143
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,720
Don't look at us. It gives me goosebumps.

144
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,610
Psycho pervert bastard.

145
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,730
Bye now.

146
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,560
You saw that, right? Like they're mad because we're peeping. Those two are suspicious, too.

147
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,000
Ninja! Ninja.

148
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,230
Ninja.

149
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,590
Hey, Ninja's here.

150
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:45,460
Oh, you were here?

151
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:47,130
Yep, I was. Why?

152
00:11:47,130 --> 00:11:49,020
Spitting Woo said to come to the office.

153
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:50,370
What? Why?

154
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:52,190
Hey, what about me? Did he say for me to come, too?

155
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,760
No, just Park Chan Hong.

156
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,250
Yes! Yes! Beenzino indeed!

157
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,200
I'm done for.

158
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,440
How come E Sens got caught but not Beenzino?

159
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:06,460

160
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,250
This sense.

161
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,810
Teacher, I'm sso--

162
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,050
This time, it's you.

163
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,930
You're going to go representing our school.

164
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,470
Look at this sense. Your sense of lines and title.

165
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:33,410
If you just keep doing it like this at the competition, I think you'll be one of the tops.

166
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:37,050
Let's give this a try. It'll help you with getting into college too. It's great.

167
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,400
Teachers!

168
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,710
I believe we will be bringing back good news from this year's Baekiljang (writing competition).

169
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:45,760
We have discovered a great poet.

170
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,360
Here. Read it.

171
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,810
Teacher.

172
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:56,010
Don't be embarrassed. You're talented. Read it confidently.

173
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,520
Here. Here.

174
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,730
I'll read it for real?

175
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,640
I'll read it.

176
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:13,790
Title: Poison. Poet: Park Chan Hong.

177
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:19,140
"After time passes, the many memories covered by dust.

178
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:24,250
As time passes, the poison filling my body.

179
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:28,530
Wanting to be free...

180
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,700
this ever growing...

181
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:42,820
while now I...

182
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,460
I am half-dead."

183
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,530
He's crying?

184
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,130
I'll continue.

185
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,810
"What can be seen by the eyes."

186
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:11,300
It's great, Ninja.

187
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:15,010
Finally, you show yourself. Tada.

188
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:18,980
What do I do? I've never written a poem.

189
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,300
Hey, should I go and fess up now?

190
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:26,360
Hey, hey. If you go? If you go and you'll taste hell.

191
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:29,180
And you might get me caught.

192
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:31,280
You traitor. This is nuts.

193
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,480
Poetry isn't anything so hard.

194
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,070
You rationalize ambition.

195
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,490
Whatever is down there, you pull it up high above.

196
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,450
You write it pretty.

197
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:43,130
I seriously want to kill you.

198
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,760
Here, think of me as your ingredient and think.

199
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,950
Use me as your ingredient.

200
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:53,080
Lewd. Filthy.  Damp. Annoying. Sigh. Happy?

201
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:03,490
That woman's got some force.

202
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:10,770
By chance, are you student Heo Don Hyuk's mother?

203
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:12,620
Yes.

204
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:17,240
Don Hyuk had something come up, so it's just me.

205
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,990
I see. Come in.

206
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,570
Let's go.

207
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,090
Heo Don Hyuk. Heo Don Hyuk.

208
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,970
Can't be  that  Heo Don Hyuk?

209
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,490
Who's he?

210
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:34,440
You don't know him? Dongmun High School's "iron man" Heo Don Hyuk?

211
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,720
His cruelty is infamous. Was it last winter maybe?

212
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,560
 He fought alone 1 vs. 10 and he sent them all to the hospital.

213
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,180
 I heard he went to juvie over it.  
 (T/N: "juvie" - a detention center or court for juvenile offenders)

214
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,700
 I guess he was reinstated to come back to school, to our school.

215
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,970
 I guess bloody wind is coming our way.

216
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,450
 Just don't get mixed up with him no matter what.

217
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:57,780
 It's a matter of a second that our school turns into hell then.

218
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,960
 Don Hyuk's on Spring Break so be prepared.

219
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,780
Mom,

220
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:11,660
can I go to Granny's over Spring Break?

221
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,760
What nonsense.

222
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:18,930
Nonsense? The cute grandson wants to see his granny.

223
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:21,070
Don't you miss your mom, Mom?

224
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:25,190
Woah, Son, that's such a great idea.

225
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,670
Dad, right? Isn't it a great idea?

226
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,620
Yep.

227
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,590
Don't you love a great idea.

228
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,010
What? You haven't gone to your mother's in a long while either.

229
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:39,860
Yeah, take Chan Hong and make a trip.

230
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,790
Get some countryside air into your nostrils, too.

231
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,720
But these men, seriously.

232
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,070
Hey, Park Chan Hong, you're not thinking about finishing up your homework that's piled up?

233
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,200
And wouldn't I know what our Chung Jae is thinking?

234
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,860
What are you going to do when I'm not here?

235
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,150
You're going to bring and pile up a bunch of junk again?

236
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,680
Get a grip, all right?

237
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:02,430
Jeez. What did I bring in?

238
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,840
Mom, I can work hard on it after we get back.

239
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:11,020
Quiet.

240
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,890
- Chan Hong. 
- Yes?

241
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:18,740
You heard, right? Fold that idea.

242
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,110
And fold this, too.

243
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:22,820
Yes.

244
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:31,010
Mother said she dislikes Mother's Mother.

245
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:35,170
Mother said she dislikes Mother's Mother. 
 (T/N: a parody of G.O.D's song)

246
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:39,450
 And we live on so.

247
00:17:39,450 --> 00:17:42,130
 And we regret so.

248
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:45,420
 And the tears fall.

249
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,870
So we have an important family event then.

250
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:52,510
Really?

251
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,680
What's your mother's cellphone number.

252
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,680
What?

253
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,450
I'll talk to her. What is it?

254
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,130
So, I'm stage-shy so going to a competition is...

255
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:10,330
Hey, here.

256
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:14,430
This is Uhm Se Yoon who's going with you as the art representative.

257
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,990
You know her, right?

258
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,820
 Of course, I know her.

259
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,890
This is author, Park Chan Hong, who will compete in Baekiljang.

260
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,720
He's representing the poetry division.

261
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,550
What are you guys doing just standing there?

262
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:34,400
You can shout, "fighting" or...

263
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,830
You can shake hands.

264
00:18:56,730 --> 00:19:00,400
 That day, not over stuff like grades.

265
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,920
 But I dreamed about dying for someone.

266
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,420
Eat first.

267
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,210
And this.

268
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:39,940
Green is supposed to be this winter's trend.

269
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,790
Mom!

270
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:47,910
It's weird how I don't really get cold in my hands.

271
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:50,900
My son, fighting!

272
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,700
He's studying!

273
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,500
Fighting.

274
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,220

275
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:03,480
 In the place you were supposed to come to.

276
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,700
 While I went ahead there to wait for you.

277
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:10,390
 All the steps coming towards me...

278
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,810
 were thumps into my heart.

279
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:17,890
 Everyone who opened the door and entered,

280
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:21,180
 were you and were you

281
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:26,740
 and were supposed to be you but the door closes again.

282
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,920
 Dearly beloved.

283
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,080
 I wait for you who is not coming.

284
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,180
 While I am going towards you.

285
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,160
 Through the door that others opened and entered,

286
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:46,460
 I follow all the footsteps that thumped into my heart.

287
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:51,730
 While I am waiting for you I am going towards you.

288
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,550
What's taking so long.

289
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:23,150
You still have the same taste.

290
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,180
Huh? What is?

291
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,880
That knit shirt. And it's purple.

292
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,630
Well, strangely, I like purple.

293
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:42,950
They say if you like purple, you're psycho, but I'm really not.

294
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:46,030
I mean, not strange like Kyung Pyo.

295
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,950
I'm close with Kyung Pyo, of course.

296
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,910
But actually a bit, you know so purple color—

297
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,740
That color doesn't suit you.

298
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,810
It's tacky.

299
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,590
Was I too mean?

300
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,600
No, it's all right.

301
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,250
Men don't get hurt over stuff like that.

302
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,310
I don't mean it in a mean way.

303
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,370
But it's just that your skin tone is on the darker side,

304
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:17,900
so wine or navy colors would suit you well.

305
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,950
Wine color and navy?

306
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:26,450
Wine or navy. Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.

307
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,350
By the way, Park Chan Hong.

308
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:31,350
 - She remembers my name too.  
 -Yep, go ahead.

309
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:35,220
 Uhm Se Yoon called my name, Park Chan Hong.

310
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,820
 That Uhm Se Yoon, said my name!

311
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:41,000
 Wait.

312
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,910
 "Before I called her name,"

313
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:49,550
 - "she never..." who was the one who said that?

314
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,900
- Hey, what are you doing? 
-  I clearly read it.

315
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,480
Oh yeah, Kim Joon Soo. Flower. Right?

316
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:57,340
What the?

317
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,710
Geez!

318
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:38,200
 You can't leave the city. And three hours starting from now,

319
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,220
 this is where you turn it in, but you can roam around freely.

320
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,610
 So we'll start now.

321
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:51,160
♫  Like the birds in the sky   ♫

322
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,120
♫  Flying    ♫

323
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,340
♫  because I don't want to miss any moment  ♫

324
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:05,920
♫  Like so our meeting came to us like Spring  ♫

325
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:12,450
♫  but everything was just momentary and I really didn't know  ♫

326
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:19,910
♫  On a late Autumn day  ♫

327
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:24,890
♫  your eyes which seemed dampened by dew   ♫

328
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:31,930
♫  The trip you are about to go on  ♫

329
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:37,160
♫  you held my hands that were shaking  ♫

330
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,010
It's a nice sight but it's a bit cold, isn't it?

331
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,600
Thanks.

332
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:03,460
The more winter chills and aches,

333
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,500
our radiant love that was...

334
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:12,740
Suddenly, I thought of poetry.

335
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,200
Yes.

336
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:18,680
I guess you like blue?

337
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,670
Me too.

338
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:25,400
Indeed. This seems like something's between us, right?

339
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,120
Yes, I think so.

340
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,900
Right? What should I say it's—

341
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:32,480
A wall. A very high wall.

342
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:20,400
Hey, Park Chan Hong, why are you following me?

343
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,290
Oh. Well...

344
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,270
You're not going to paint?

345
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,600
You only have three hours.

346
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,800
Why aren't you writing a poem then?

347
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,890
It looks like you.

348
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,680
You're even good at making snowmen.

349
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:59,120
We still have two hours left.

350
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:02,120
Why aren't you writing a poem?

351
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,690
I've never seen Spitting Woo praising anyone before.

352
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:11,790
But why aren't you painting? You're good at it.

353
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:14,380
Because I don't want to hate it.

354
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,520
What?

355
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,680
My dad.

356
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:29,050
Even if I win an award, if he opposes to me doing art,

357
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:33,450
I think I might really feel hurt.

358
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,200
And you?

359
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,080
Me what?

360
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,890
How do you feel about doing art?

361
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,100
How's that important?

362
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:07,040
What are you doing, Park Chan Hong? It looks weird now.

363
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:14,630
My dad said whatever you run to unknowingly is what you really like.

364
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:20,160
I don't care if this snowman collapses.

365
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,450
But it doesn't seem like that to you.

366
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:44,210
Hey, Park Chan Hong, don't try to act cool.

367
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:48,070
I'm not acting cool.

368
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:03,330
 Words that I couldn't bring up.

369
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:06,340
 They are like snow that came down on you.

370
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:10,630
 It was the first snow of Spring in my 18th-year-old life.

371
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:17,650
 Your footsteps are stamped into the white snow.

372
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:22,650
 And on top of that, I try to match my feet.

373
00:30:22,650 --> 00:30:28,450
 Knowing they wouldn't match, but as though they're a key

374
00:30:28,450 --> 00:30:33,610
 and I might open your door.

375
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:39,140
 As though before you drew snow, the world didn't have snow.

376
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:47,020
♫  ...small but beautiful   ♫

377
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:53,430
♫  Those past days that wave their hands at me

378
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:56,950
♫  May tomorrow be brilliant, too  ♫

379
00:30:56,950 --> 00:31:03,280
♫  More beautiful than yesterday  ♫

380
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,540

381
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:17,550
 Wet sand remembers footsteps.

382
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:23,550
 Just why I thought of that line suddenly,

383
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:27,400
 at the time I had no idea.

384
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,010

385
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,320
Over here.

386
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,270
Author Park.

387
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:46,280
Like this, with the aura of an author.

388
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,140
- Here. Smile big. 
- Wait, wait!

389
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:54,320
So pretty.

390
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,550
Here. Without the bouquets.

391
00:31:57,550 --> 00:31:59,560
Bouquets.

392
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:07,530
- Here, Author Park. 
- Se Yoon, where are you looking?

393
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,710
Author Park.

394
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:17,020
It's great.

395
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:20,100
When the new term starts, the kids will see these.

396
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:25,040
The poem and the drawing look great together like a set. Right?

397
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,000
Yes.

398
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:35,920
 "Those words that I could not bring up..."

399
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:42,190
Teacher.

400
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,800
Teacher?

401
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:50,370
You painted so well. How do you paint so well?

402
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:57,620
