1
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:03,190

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:12,090

3
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:15,880
 Mid term is starting.

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,960
 All students should find their seats.

5
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,300
 Happiness.

6
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:13,220
 I am the happiest man in the world.

7
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,010
 My wife runs a tea shop so there are no worries about living.

8
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:23,190
 I have gone to college so I do not lack learning either.

9
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,120
 And I have a home so how comfortable is my life?

10
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:35,110
 I like rice wine and my wife buys it all for me, so what complaints would I have?

11
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,930
 Moreover I am a firm believer of God.

12
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,590
 So the strongest entity above this Earth has my back,

13
00:01:44,590 --> 00:01:47,380
 so what misfortune would come to me?

14
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,160

15
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:59,700

16
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,610
 Just because the poetic protagonist is expressed in negative tense and lexicon,

17
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:08,950
 it does not mean it is clearly a gloomy and dark theme.

18
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,160
 Instead actually, those negative expressions

19
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,870
 can sometimes hold the pride of the author towards happiness.

20
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,870
 I repeat, no matter how hard you try, you will show yourself.

21
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,830

22
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,620
Teacher, may I leave if I'm done?

23
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,920
Already?

24
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,250
Yes.

25
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,390
Turn in your answer sheet and go.

26
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:51,690
Mithra. I think I know who it is.

27
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,410
What?

28
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:59,100
In our school, the weakest

29
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:02,840
and the loneliest and most anxious one.

30
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:07,040
No one by his side.

31
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,430
Always alone. The only one.

32
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:17,830
And the one who gave us information so we could go to Jo Pyeong Seop.

33
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,730
What did you say?

34
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:36,040
What did you just say?

35
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,150
I'm Mithra.

36
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,490
Shin Seo Jung you liked. I was the one who turned her over to Jo Pyeong Seop to die.

37
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,560
You don't believe me?

38
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,230
That an idiot like me is Mithra?

39
00:03:57,230 --> 00:04:01,810
How? But why?

40
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:05,380
Chan Hong thought you were a friend.

41
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,100
Friend?

42
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:17,150
Don't follow me unless you want to die. Don't try to come in no matter what.

43
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,740

44
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,150

45
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,840

46
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,700
 The other documents Mithra has.

47
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,900
 Get them all here without anything lost and take care of him clean.

48
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,430
Are you all right? Are you hurt anywhere?

49
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,800
I'm fine.

50
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,620
But Ahn Seong Do is inside. Ahn Seong Do is Mithra.

51
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,080
I know.

52
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,860
Let's go in.

53
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,110
Uhm Se Yoon, I told you not to come.

54
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,190
Just leave me to die.

55
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,920
Who says you can die so easily?

56
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:15,870
We didn't come to save you out of worry.

57
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,690
We're letting you live because I want to hear the reason.

58
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,770
Why did you do that to Seo Jung?

59
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:25,070
Why, I said!

60
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,130
Aren't you all the same as me though?

61
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:38,810
The most popular kids at Jaeil High and the ones around them.

62
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:44,280
I was so curious about how strong this castle was.

63
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,150
But it collapses so easily like a sandcastle.

64
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,950
It wasn't just me who was all fucked up.

65
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:58,460
Even if you have friends by you it's just that.

66
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:08,170
It never collapsed.

67
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:14,570
Don Hyuk came here and Se Yoon, too.

68
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:23,100
We're all doing our best to do justice for Seo Jung.

69
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,490
We're not a sandcastle.

70
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:27,330
Yeah.

71
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,720
Then me.

72
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,340
Me who was always outside that castle!

73
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:41,280
You guys all saw how Kim Dae Yong bullied me.

74
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,980
 Did you bring it?

75
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,080
 Give me your backpack.

76
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,220
Among you...

77
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:10,720
If any one of you wanted to, you could have saved me.

78
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,520
But you left me be.

79
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,940
Because you didn't want to get involved and be like me.

80
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:25,600
That brilliant friendship that you guys only had. That filthy friendship.

81
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:34,100
It disgusted me so much I crumbled it. So?

82
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,060
For me,

83
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,350
yes, me too. Honestly, I don't know what friendship really is.

84
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,500
But you know, I'll ask you one thing.

85
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:55,080
Did you ever seriously reach your hand out to anyone?

86
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,460
When I first met Heo Don Hyuk, too,

87
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:08,270
I thought I'd never want to mix with him in my life.

88
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:15,070
I didn't know him, but I always talked behind his back with Kyung Pyo.

89
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:22,080
But it wasn't the case when I got close to him.

90
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:27,220
He looks on the outside the strongest in the world,

91
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,190
but he was no different than me in any way.

92
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:38,980
He is anxious daily and there is loads of stuff he doesn't know and he gets hurt easily.

93
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,220
Just the same, as it turns out.

94
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:49,270
You may think Seo Jung had everything,

95
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,670
but she was not different than you.

96
00:10:53,670 --> 00:11:00,370
Just someone who wanted to be loved and happy.

97
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,910
Just a 19-year-old, just the same.

98
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,300
Ah, geez!

99
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,430
I know.

100
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:43,060
When I tried to turn it around,

101
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,760
it was too late.

102
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,240
I just wanted to make it so it was not all my fault.

103
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,550
Because that's how I could sustain.

104
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,700
I'm sorry.

105
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,400
Let...

106
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,790
Let go!

107
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:22,820
No one cares if I die anyway.

108
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:27,520
Live. Live and bear through it.

109
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:31,990
It's not because I'm worried about you.

110
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:36,860
It's not because I forgive you either. Just live somehow.

111
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:40,410
Live no matter what.

112
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:44,260
Let go.

113
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,280
 Only 19.

114
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:58,600
 Anxious as us.

115
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:06,710
 Because we still didn't know well what friendship meant.

116
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:09,350
 What we thought was friendship,

117
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:14,020
 but at times it just leaves us wounds and an end.

118
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,290
 When we become adults, will it be whole?

119
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:33,630
 I just wish we could look at each other.

120
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:40,820
 Longer. And more sincerely.

121
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:45,980
 Just a bit more tenderly.

122
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,010
 Miss A who ran for Kangpo city council this year,

123
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:04,400
 was arrested for kidnapping and illegal photos of teenagers.

124
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:08,730
Aigo, look at that. I knew it.

125
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:11,960
Her face just didn't feel right.

126
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,880
Something there.

127
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,760
And I voted for someone else because of it.

128
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,990
 Coercing and forcing minors for prostitution.

129
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:23,130
 Miss Jo under police investigation...

130
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:25,770
Okay, done.

131
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:32,970
Hey. If a person can be fixed like this, too, that would be so great.

132
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:37,850
Son, money or power, that's all useless.

133
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:43,230
Just live kind and earnest. That's the best.

134
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:48,060
Kind and earnest but can earn lots of money would be really good.

135
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,870
Yes.

136
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,120
Goodness, that was good.

137
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,280
Aren't you hungry, Dear?

138
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:57,340
Is it time to eat already?

139
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,280
I'm thinking about making the spicy beef soup you love.

140
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,790
Oh. Spicy beef soup.

141
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:05,960
Son! Mom says spicy beef soup.

142
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,440
Goodness, Madam. Thank you.

143
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,790
I am happy. I love you.

144
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:11,570
My Lord, you are being kind.

145
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:15,890
Wow, I can't just let this feeling pass. We need a song.

146
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:19,850
If you're turning on music, I'll sing, too.

147
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:21,890
Wow!

148
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:32,600

You have to vibrate that part.

00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,970
Great job.

156
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,290
All done?

157
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:11,730
Yeah, almost.

158
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:16,500
Heo Don Hyuk, I guess you'll get to eat home-cooked meals.

159
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,240
You'll miss my mom's cooking. What are you going to do?

160
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,110
My mom's good at cooking, too.

161
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:29,480
Come by. Eat and sleep over.

162
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,450
Heo Don Hyuk.

163
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,140
What?

164
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,920
Heo Don Hyuk!

165
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:46,460
What? What the heck are you doing?

166
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,100
Let's hug it out once.

167
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,860
Are you nuts?

168
00:16:57,590 --> 00:17:00,070
You're crazy.

169
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:04,740
If you do anything weird, I'm going to kill you for real.

170
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:15,180
Heo Don Hyuk,

171
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,670
you had it hard.

172
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:24,170
Hey. People will think you were the older brother.

173
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:29,910
I got it, so stop this.

174
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:33,710
No. You don't know.

175
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,360
Seriously. Stop.

176
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,150
Heo Don Hyuk,

177
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:45,280
let's send off Seo Jung now.

178
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:54,660
If you were punished like this, she would've forgiven it all.

179
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,080
She must have been so upset from above.

180
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:04,390
So, now, forgive yourself.

181
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:11,350
And come out from this cave, too.

182
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,400
It's not your fault, Don Hyuk.

183
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,220

184
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,870
Yep.

185
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,920
No, worse.

186
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:29,760
Listen to me first this time.

187
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:38,010
Actually, I'm not so sure how good I'll be in art,

188
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:42,750
if I can actually make a living with it, Dad.

189
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,720
How would I know that?

190
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,150
But, at the very least,

191
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,590
when I draw, I know how I feel.

192
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,100
When I draw...

193
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,120
the world seems pretty like it's very liveable.

194
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:13,230
And it feels like I'm inside that pretty canvas.

195
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:20,270
So I'm going to draw.

196
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:25,570
It's enough if I'm happy, right?

197
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,840
Whether you like it or not, I don't care.

198
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,920
I'm going to keep saying it.

199
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:41,300
At the very least, I will not be the first to lock the door.

200
00:21:55,810 --> 00:21:57,920

201
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,210

202
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,820
You made a big decision.

203
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,270
Yes.

204
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:13,230
Chan Hong.

205
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,820
Yes?

206
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:19,240
Do you know why I couldn't become a poet and ended up here?

207
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:25,960
Once upon a time, poetry was everything, I had thought.

208
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:32,000
I gave up on everything else and just hung myself on poetry.

209
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:38,410
In the end, my life crumbled.

210
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,230
When life is crumbled, you can't write poetry.

211
00:22:44,180 --> 00:22:48,320
Fortunately, I came to be fond of school. Very.

212
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,520
Now it's better to look at a student like you instead of poetry.

213
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:59,160
Chan Hong, you have to not allow what you like ruin you.

214
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,370
- Got that?
- Yes.

215
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:06,030
And also, more important than that...

216
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:07,630
Teacher Choi.

217
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:12,940
- Let's talk later. What are you doing today after work?
- Why?

218
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,450
What do you mean why? I mean let's live our life fulfilled.

219
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:20,600
Spectate on flowers before they wither, and eat and watch a movie, too.

220
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,540
That's not a bad course.

221
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:24,010
Right?

222
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:28,290
It's the man that is slightly so-so.

223
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,880
What?

224
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:34,850
You sure joke.

225
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:37,260
Did you put on a wig?

226
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:41,890
Is it a wig?

227
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:48,070
 The language of cherry blossoms is a beautiful woman and chaste.

228
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:51,550
 No more life and death.

229
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:56,080
 While rapeseed flowers signify brightness and hope.

230
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,950
 At age 19,

231
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:03,910
 it's like crossing between cherry blossoms and rapeseed flowers.

232
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:08,150
 Jump roping between death and hope.

233
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:12,840
♫  Past days that were like winter  ♫

234
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,810
Your hair's loose.

235
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:18,140
Choi Mira.

236
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,430
♫  ...when spring comes   ♫

237
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,760
Do you like me or not?

238
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,320
Am I a looker or not?

239
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,360
Am I pretty or not?

240
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,950
 His grades are so-so and his looks are so-so.

241
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,950
 And he's also so-so at sports. This Kyung Pyo.

242
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:42,160
 But he's not so interested in what Mira did either.

243
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:46,820
 Because that is Kyung Pyo. That makes him King Psycho.

244
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:51,560
- Hey, you got 'beauty' stuck on you.
- Hey, why did you hit me?

245
00:24:52,830 --> 00:25:02,810
♫  Hoping tomorrow will shine too, more beautiful 
than yesterday  ♫

246
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,740
 And Don Hyuk.

247
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,910
 He goes to see Kwak Sang Pil once a week.

248
00:25:22,710 --> 00:25:25,960
 His friend,

249
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,330
 he reclaimed after much hardship.

250
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:34,810
I put in some underwear and socks for you.

251
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:38,910
Since there's no need to look cool in there.

252
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,100
Bastard acting like he knows.

253
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,820
Hey. The juvenile center you were in

254
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:46,710
are where little kiddos gather to talk about girls.

255
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:50,860
And this place where this older brother is staying is where adults talk about national issues.

256
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:55,100
I guess the jail is liveable enough seeing how you can still blabber.

257
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,980
Who should say that. You look good, Heo Don Hyuk.

258
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:04,290
Sang Pil...

259
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,690
Get lost if you're going to say sorry or thanks.

260
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:15,220
Am I nuts to say that?

261
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:21,320
Just get your senses straight now. I'm leaving.

262
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,000
Hey, Heo Don Hyuk.

263
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:27,950
When I get out,

264
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:33,490
I'll be changed, too, right? Like you.

265
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,870
Not you, bastard. It's because it's me that I could.

266
00:26:54,790 --> 00:27:00,850
 And me, I write a letter to Seong Do once a week.

267
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:05,400
 He's not accepting visits yet.

268
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:09,390
 But at times he returns my letters.

269
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,130
 Don Hyuk, let's eat!

270
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,940
I told you, I'm not eating!

271
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,220
 Hurry and come eat!

272
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:48,730
I'm on a diet, I told her.

273
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,240
 I told you. They're coming.

274
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:03,960
 Chan Hong's mom seriously put up a whole table.

275
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,610
 Ack. Why are you hitting me?

276
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:09,600
 Ack. Seriously!

277
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,080
Should we make it thicker?

278
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:16,610
I think this feels good now.

279
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:20,220
Natural, and if it's too thick it will stand out too much.

280
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,650
Right.

281
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,700
The color's pretty.

282
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:28,910
It's really good to mix with the different tones, right?

283
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:31,180
Done?

284
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,680
Chan Hong.

285
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:35,620

286
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,330
This is it?

287
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:40,980
Isn't lovely and pretty good enough?

288
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,960
Geez.

289
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,310
Here.

290
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,990

291
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,540
Oh Kyung Pyo, pass.

292
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,940
Oh. Heo Don Hyuk!

293
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,700

294
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:17,910

295
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:24,690

296
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,310
Hey, Park Chan Hong!

297
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,500
Here.

298
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,470

299
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:19,500

300
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:32,090
♫  Back then I could only feel the heat  ♫

301
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:38,200
♫  Now that I think back  ♫

302
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:44,310
♫  The past days that are like cold winter  ♫

303
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:52,880
♫  Now that I think about it it was spring back then  ♫

304
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:58,780
♫  Seasons leave  ♫

305
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:05,160
♫  Taking my memories  ♫

306
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:11,540
♫  The past days wave at me  ♫

307
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:19,500
♫  Tomorrow to shine again, more beautiful than yesterday   ♫
