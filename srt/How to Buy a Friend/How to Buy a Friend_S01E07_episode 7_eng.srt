1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,720
 A loanshark and a gangster.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,710
 How did you rise up to be the city councilman?

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:09,870
 I need a real one. A real young one who really knows nothing.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:13,370
 So he stole someone else's picture and pretended to be him.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:15,500
 She must have been drugged.

6
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,270
 They took photos and extorted her.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,170
 This afternoon a female high school student's deceased body was discovered.

8
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,020
 And the police have started an investigation.

9
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,490
 It is suspected that Miss A jumped off on her own.

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,530
 There's a bastard who took the pictures and sent them to me on purpose.

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,940
 Tell me. Who was Seo Jung?

12
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:41,810
 She was with a guy who had a tattoo on his ankle.

13
00:00:41,810 --> 00:00:44,410
 Oh, cigarette butt. The day Shin Seo Jung died.

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,110
 That hit-and-run car threw out a cigarette butt and fled.

15
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,620
 Cigarette butt.

16
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,290
 What did you say you saw that day?

17
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:53,930
 - This is a message Shin Seo Jung left on a condition dating site.
- She didn't write it.

18
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,750
 Did Seo Jung really post that? But isn't it weird?

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,990
 You knew Shin Seo Jung, right?

20
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,550
 Seo Jung was a beautiful writer, too.

21
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,500
 That dating bulletin post.

22
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,890
 She didn't write it.

23
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:11,300
 Choi Mira. You wrote it, right?

24
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,450
 I didn't know that would happen to her.

25
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:20,570
 I didn't know she would...

26
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:23,570
 There wasn't a cellphone by Seo Jung's body.

27
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:27,030
 But I think you were the last one who saw her phone.

28
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:31,790
 She left it in my locker before she died.

29
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:36,120
 Everyone tells me I will win the election but why am I so anxious?

30
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,520
 Oh right, that cellphone.

31
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:43,830
 You have a pink cellphone, right?

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,120
 Why are there two calculators?

33
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:59,280
 With the video in there, you and I will hold hands going to jail.

34
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,980
 Wet sand remembers footprints.

35
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,130
 The line you wrote was the last text Seo Jung sent me.

36
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:09,120
 It was the same as the last text Seo Jung sent me before her death.

37
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:12,400
 You don't know? Sign game.

38
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,590
 Seo Jung and Se Yoon often played it.

39
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,170
 Wet sand...

40
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,190
 remembers footprints.

41
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,210
Hey. You probably won't get respected.

42
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:33,480
A man needs to be like him; have a dangerous taste to him.

43
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,390
You! You were at the school the day Seo Jung died, right?

44
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,540
What a dangerous kid for real.

45
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,430
You are at least better than the detectives.

46
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,730
Why did you kill her?

47
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:02,250
Why did you kill Seo Jung?

48
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:06,700
- Her name was Seo Jung?
- What?

49
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:10,890
I did go. To claim that pesky cellphone.

50
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,170
If I had gotten there just a bit earlier,

51
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:17,910
I could have saved her, too, huh?

52
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:22,010
At any rate, thanks.

53
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,860
To come here on your own when I was looking for you...

54
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,110
Where's the cellphone?

55
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,500
- That's...
- Don't say it.

56
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,480
If you tell her, we're all dead.

57
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,680
Seriously.

58
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:47,910
- That's...
- Don't ever tell, Park Chan Hong.

59
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:52,030
Oh right. Uhm Se Yoon?

60
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:57,360
Your girlfriend. You should save her.

61
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,890
Nice and pretty.

62
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,680
Let's start with pictures.

63
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,350
I think she's going to be worth some money if I send them out.

64
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:13,650
Hey, grab her. Hurry!

65
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,510
So I can see the face, rascal.

66
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,110
Right.

67
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,360
Okay, good with the face showing.

68
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,910
Higher.

69
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:38,470
Se Yoon.

70
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,130
Se Yoon!

71
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,190
Chan Hong!

72
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,580
Se Yoon!

73
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,340
What are you going to do?

74
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:56,890
Do I sell her to the island and kill you two here?

75
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,310
Hey, kid.

76
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,500
Why do you suppose I do stuff like this,

77
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,870
but no one talks about it?

78
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,440
It's because I keep my promise.

79
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,670
Whether that's bad or good.

80
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,140
Right, Sang Pil?

81
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,700
- Yes.
- Bastard.

82
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,660
I'll promise you.

83
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,090
Just put it in this hand.

84
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:26,640
And you three will be let go right away.

85
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,460
Don Hyuk!

86
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:52,570
♫  keep your eyes wide open and look around  ♫

87
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,310
Lady,

88
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:03,780
I'll give it to you. The cellphone.

89
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,600

90
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:08,400

91
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:28,220
Se Yoon.

92
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:31,070
Are you all right?

93
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:35,950
I'm fine.

94
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:43,620
Don Hyuk,

95
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:49,150
I think this wasn't right.

96
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:54,880
- If now, the phone...
- Chan Hong,

97
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,430
if we get out of here...

98
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,460
can I come to your house to eat again?

99
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,850
Why this out of the blue?

100
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,500
His house has really good kimchi stew.

101
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,770
Se Yoon, if you eat it once, you'll keep thinking about it, too.

102
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,520
Especially on a day like today.

103
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,550
Heo Don Hyuk, just...

104
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,550
Let's hurry and get out.

105
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,690
Let's get out first. I'm fine. Seriously.

106
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:46,030
Seo Jung would have done the same as me.

107
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:57,910
Stop thinking bad thoughts.

108
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:07,930
"I made a mistake. It's bad. I'm dead. It's my fault."

109
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:12,270
"Earth is collapsing and I'll die first."

110
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:14,830
Stop that stuff, I mean.

111
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,240
Mira, instead of that,

112
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,970
think about dirty thoughts instead.

113
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,580
That's more productive.

114
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,640
Mira,

115
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,040
let's live a long time.

116
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,770
Just unabashed, let's live for a long time.

117
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:45,110
Don't die and a long time.

118
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,080
With friends. Long time.

119
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,400
Curse behind them, and get mad and fight, too.

120
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,580
Kids like you and me, look the other way, too.

121
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:02,730
Just live a long time.

122
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,130
Mira,

123
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,580
I like you.

124
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,330
I mean it.

125
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,740
If only a little bit...

126
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,410
If only a little bit...

127
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:37,770
Mira, what?

128
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:41,460
Why aren't you a little bit more handsome!

129
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,750
Uh.

130
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,190
What am I supposed to do?

131
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:58,300
I'm all right if you keep looking at me.

132
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,520
It's not okay.

133
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,840
What?

134
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,500
 Is Chan Hong with you?

135
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,590
 He's not been answering for a while.

136
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:15,000
 Ninja, where did you go?

137
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,940
 The phone cannot be answered.

138
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,840
 How come no one's answering?

139
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:33,640
It's so refreshing like I pooped a big one.

140
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,380
Release them.

141
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,360
It's amazing seeing an adult who keeps promises, right?

142
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,970
Why was it Seo Jung?

143
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,790
Why was it Seo Jung, of all!

144
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:03,860
Your question is wrong.

145
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:06,810
Who is the one to let us know?

146
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,770
You should ask that first.

147
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,080
I'm very curious, too.

148
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,010
If you find him, make sure to let me know.

149
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:21,760
I'm going to kill you.

150
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,820
Yes, Councilman. Sure!

151
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,010
Come around again.

152
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,240
What?

153
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,340
Go, bastard!

154
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,920
Now you act like a friend after getting all you wanted?

155
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,680
Don't bother me and get out!

156
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:52,300
Hey!

157
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:13,100
I'm going first.

158
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,590
I'll go with you.

159
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,830
Are you trying to make it so obvious it's your first time dating?

160
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,790
You should walk Uhm Se Yoon home.

161
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,720
I'm going, too.

162
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,710
My leg.

163
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,920
I'll go alone from here.

164
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,640
I'll walk you.

165
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,520
Mom and Dad are probably waiting out front.

166
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,870
Oh. Right.

167
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:51,380
Today was really scary, right?

168
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,730
Sorry, it's late.

169
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,560
No.

170
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,670
You know, Chan Hong.

171
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:04,450
I really like you a lot, too.

172
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:07,910
And I know well that you like me a lot, too.

173
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,660
But...

174
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,320
What can we do for each other exactly?

175
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:20,770
In the end, we couldn't do anything for Seo Jung. Like that.

176
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:24,700
So,

177
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:29,040
it's not your fault.

178
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:32,550
Don't be sorry.

179
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:50,240
Hey, why didn't you answer your phone?

180
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:54,950
You. What is this?

181
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,380
Hey. What happened?

182
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:59,760
Hey, who did this?

183
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,570
Were you with him again?

184
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,530
That Don Hyuk or something.

185
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,350
- This happened with him?
 - No.

186
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:08,250
What do you mean no?

187
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,370
Give me his phone number. Right away.

188
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:13,590
I need to call.

189
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,080
It's not that.

190
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,870
Talk. Who did it?

191
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:23,010
Hey, what parents pretend like they didn't see their kid like this?

192
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,810
Hurry and talk or else.

193
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:27,490
You know, go get the rod.

194
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,360
Hey, just ask tomorrow.

195
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,650
Now! Go!

196
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:34,110
Fine. You...

197
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:36,460
You stay here. I'll get it myself.

198
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,620
Aigo, the kid's hurt.

199
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,870
There are things you can't talk about.

200
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,270
There are things...

201
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:53,850
you can't talk about.

202
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:58,600
Things that cannot be explained.

203
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,320
There are things like that, too.

204
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,880
You're a man, too, Dad.

205
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,470
At times, things like this happen.

206
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:28,080
♫  Back then I only felt the heat  ♫

207
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,900
 We were all 19 years old.

208
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,700
 But we are living in different moments.

209
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,030
 Park Chan Hong, living Park Chan Hong's life.

210
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:42,850
♫  Those past days that are chilling as winter  ♫

211
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,950

212
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,540
 Heo Don Hyuk, as Heo Don Hyuk's life.

213
00:20:54,750 --> 00:21:00,340
♫  I'm leaving, holding onto memories   ♫

214
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:05,070
 Uhm Se Yoon is living out Uhm Se Yoon's life.

215
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:15,760
 Their differences.  Can they be filled completely?

216
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:22,740
♫  The past days waver their hands at me   ♫

217
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:26,280
♫  Hoping tomorrow will shine again  ♫

218
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:32,150
♫  More beautiful than yesterday   ♫

219
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:36,150
♫  The memories call out to me  ♫

220
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:41,680
♫  Why was I happier than then?  ♫

221
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:47,460
 The protagonist of a poem is the poem's main character.

222
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:51,610
 That could be the author himself.

223
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:54,670
 Or an imagined character.

224
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:58,580
 And at times, true to what is there.

225
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:02,680
 And at times, what one dreams to express.

226
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:05,980
Are you still affected?

227
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:08,970
Look at me. So alive.

228
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:15,030
Oh, Ninja. Are you in on tonight's game?

229
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:18,060
There's an event today and the item today is big.

230
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,640
In?

231
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,710
Oh Kyung Pyo. Right?

232
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,660
Yes, but what is it?

233
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:31,560
Starting at this moment, you're under suspicion of breach of internet communication law,

234
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,850
you are being arrested without warrant.

235
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:38,090
What? Me?

236
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,300
What are you doing?

237
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:45,260
Chan Hong! Chan Hong!

238
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,980

239
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:53,570
You know Kang Hyeon Goo, right?

240
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,440
He asked us to investigate.

241
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,870

242
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,780
Someone stole his picture and committed a crime.

243
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:09,910
Oh. That? I guess you misunderstood. It's nothing much.

244
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:13,220
Sir, so what happened was,

245
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,310
some bad guy with a tattoo.

246
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:18,850
You even went to him in person to accuse him.

247
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:21,400
- What?
- And you ran off on your own in the middle of it.

248
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,910
You created fake accounts to contact him.

249
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:29,000
That was...

250
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,870
Is it correct or not?

251
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,780
It's correct but...

252
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:37,090
So, it's correct.

253
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:46,330
You know Shin Seo Jung that died, right?

254
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,520
What?

255
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,100
Why did you text her that?

256
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:53,210
What text?

257
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:56,430
You created fake accounts to contact girls.

258
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:59,610
Then you lured them and took photos and blackmailed them.

259
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,850
Your IP was used under proxy, too, right?

260
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:07,590
We couldn't get it the whole time except once.

261
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:11,730
ID, Mithra. That's you, right?

262
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,360
Mithra? What's Mithra?

263
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,530
I don't know.

264
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:22,040
They said I used that ID to dig up on girls' info.

265
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,600
And I blackmailed them, too. I think they said that.

266
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:31,340
Don't put on that gloomy face. I didn't do anything wrong.

267
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:34,190
I'm fine.

268
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:38,030
My mom is looking for a lawyer.

269
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,210
So I should be out soon.

270
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:43,730
Hey, I got another story to talk about once I'm out.

271
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:50,320
Why is our Mira looking like this?

272
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,690
"Our" Mira?

273
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:56,140
We're dating.

274
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:58,130
That's more shocking than you being locked up in here.

275
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,400
Hey. So did you think you'd be the only one dating forever?

276
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,570
I'm going to announce it to the kids once I'm out.

277
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:06,010
So other kids can't make a move on her.

278
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:10,300
Where are you looking? Look at me.

279
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:18,560
It won't be easy I think.

280
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:23,870
If it's an arrest without warrant, it means the cops are confident.

281
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:28,380
If the real culprit doesn't show or he can't get an alibi,

282
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:32,020
he will probably be turned to the detectives in 48 hours.

283
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:37,640
That's nonsense. Kyung Pyo is innocent.

284
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:43,280
We don't have a lot of time. We have to find the perpetrator.

285
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:47,280
Yep. With the fake one arrested,

286
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:52,320
even if issues come out, they won't try to find the real one.

287
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,590
It'd be troublesome to all if they find the dead kid.

288
00:25:56,710 --> 00:26:00,590
Tell him I'll give him the promotion at the next human resource restructure.

289
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,240
Yep.

290
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,890

291
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,840

292
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,930

293
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:43,350

294
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,390
That psycho pervert. I knew he would cause trouble.

295
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,750
Hey, who didn't say that? He was weird.

296
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:56,170
Hey, it was also him with the hidden camera, they say.

297
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,900
Really? He's total trash.

298
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,380
Did he take hidden footage in the girl's bathroom?

299
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:05,630
Hey, my uncle is a cop so I heard he's totally filthy.

300
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:09,410
I knew he'd look like trouble.

301
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,200
Did you guys see it?

302
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:43,340
You guys...

303
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:48,170
What do you know about Kyung Pyo to blabber?

304
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:52,580
Did you guys see it? Did you?

305
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,950
He started to text first on the bamboo bulletin.

306
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:08,850
ID is...

307
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:11,720
Mithra.

308
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:19,190
I started to chat with him in the anonymous chat somehow.

309
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:32,260
We had a lot in common after chatting.

310
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:35,120
And he seemed compatible.

311
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:41,010
Kyung Pyo said it's dangerous so I shouldn't talk about it.

312
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:44,830
But I don't think I should.

313
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:50,840
And also, he already knew I was Choi Mira.

314
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:57,500

315
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:02,010

316
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,690

317
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,930

318
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:16,050
Mithra. He's probably someone at our school, right?

319
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,610
Yep, he reacts to your name right away.

320
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:23,890
If he didn't know you, he would've asked who that was.

321
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,480
But it seemed like he knew you.

322
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,120
It's not a girl, I think. By his speech.

323
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,080
He speaks coarse and threatening.

324
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:36,600
No. Mithra is not the violent type.

325
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,040
It's the opposite actually.

326
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:44,940
It's my thinking but I think the guy is weak.

327
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:50,170
Before, when I was getting beaten up by Kim Dae Yong,

328
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:56,770
it wasn't him that I hated. It was myself that I found pathetic.

329
00:29:58,130 --> 00:30:02,620
As if it's all my fault.

330
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:06,180
And getting upset and angry over nothing.

331
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,880
Very sensitive.

332
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:18,760
He's like me from back then. Tightly bound.

333
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,310
Even if our replies are late he doesn't ignore them.

334
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:24,980
As if...

335
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:29,550
he's a kid whining for us to play with him more.

336
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,360

337
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,660
He knows me.

338
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,620
Weak and anxious.

339
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:53,130
He used a representative.

340
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:57,740
Why? Because he can't show his face.

341
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,620
Think it out. Think.

342
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:57,000
Happy birthday, Sis.

343
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,540
I'm sorry I came so late.

344
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:13,910

345
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,860
I wanted to come much earlier.

346
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:21,300
But I was afraid I couldn't look at you,

347
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,440
and that would hurt your feelings more.

348
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,100
It took me so long.

349
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:39,050
But I didn't know it would take me a year.

350
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,700
I'm sorry.

351
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:55,200
