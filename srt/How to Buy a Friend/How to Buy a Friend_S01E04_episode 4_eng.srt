1
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:02,270

Cheer up.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,800
 In life, all sorts of things happen.

3
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:14,380
 Don't try too hard to forget.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,000
 If your friend left any items,

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:29,220
 you can look at it and remember things.

6
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:38,990

7
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,800
Seo Jung, I mean.

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,100
Yep. Why mention Shin Seo Jung suddenly.

9
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:54,090
Before she died, did she contact you separately?

10
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,910
Why would she contact me?

11
00:00:56,910 --> 00:00:59,670
I mean, we were close for a time.

12
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,570
Who was close with her?

13
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:05,650
She was close to you so I played with her, too.

14
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,570
You know the words on the dating forum.

15
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,960
Is that really something Seo Jung left?

16
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,320
I think it should be true.

17
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,100
The ID was the same and she even stole money.

18
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,630
Isn't it strange?

19
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,010
Using the same ID to leave words on a site like that, too.

20
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,050
And she wasn't poor either.

21
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:30,350
You're being funny. Do only poor kids steal money?

22
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,040
Why are you so sensitive about it?

23
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,390
Sorry. Sorry, Se Yoon.

24
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:41,600
It's just that you keep talking about a dead person.

25
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,560
Let's talk about something else, can we?

26
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:49,820
You trust me, right?

27
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,700
Of course, I trust you.

28
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,390
I have a secret.

29
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,740
Can you promise me you won't tell anyone?

30
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,950
What is it?

31
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,750
You're not going to check it? It seems urgent.

32
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:20,810
Wait a moment.

33
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,260
Se Yoon, my family's looking for me urgently.

34
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,110
Let's talk next time. Sorry.

35
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,160

36
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:42,690

37
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:51,960

38
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,380

39
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:14,980
Hey, Choi...  by chance Uhm Se Yoon...

40
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,210
Move.

41
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:45,700
We've already mixed words before but you're acting so cold.

42
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,050
I have nothing to say to you.

43
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:52,130
I have something to ask you. Just in case.

44
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,770
Let go.

45
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,910
Hey, Uhm Se Yoon.

46
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,280
You have a pink cellphone, right?

47
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,770
I guess you really do.

48
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:15,940
Let's have a look.

49
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,520
I said, let me see it!

50
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:22,120
Where is it? Your pocket?

51
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,850
- Get it out. 
- What are you doing?!

52
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:25,910
Get it out, I said. Where is it?

53
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,770
Hey, come on. Where is the phone?

54
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,300
Give it. Where is it?

55
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,940
- What are you doing! 
 - I'll block it all.

56
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,610
- Give it. 
 - Just remember anything.

57
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,510
Fuck it.

58
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,030
 I don't remember anything.

59
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,380
What are you doing?

60
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,890
 If you lie, I will really kill you.

61
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:57,960
 Poetic license, even if you use grammar wrong,

62
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,260
 Poetic license.

63
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,220
 It can allow you to ignore proper spelling and also grammar.

64
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,500
 For what?

65
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,520
 For beauty. To achieve creative beauty.

66
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,330
Let go.

67
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:18,800
 - Yeah, Park Chan Hong.

68
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,840
I remembered.

69
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,900
Let's sign the contract. If you're still interested come to the back door.

70
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,470
Give it, I said.

71
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,090
- In your pocket? 
- What are you doing?

72
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:38,220
Is it in your pocket? Pull it out. Where is it?

73
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,340
Bastard. Crazy shit.

74
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,870
Listen clearly.

75
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:20,170
From now on, Uhm Se Yoon and Park Chan Hong, if you mess with those two,

76
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,390
you die by me.

77
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,950
I'll take care of it here, so you guys go first.

78
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,020
Okay. Thanks.

79
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,540
No need to be embarrassed.

80
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,380
Heo Don Hyuk.

81
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:00,070
How do I stop this?

82
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:10,100
You have to be honest. To yourself.

83
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:18,260
That you're shaking now. That you're scared.

84
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,790
No need to be embarrassed.

85
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:26,010
And just acknowledge and accept, so you can control it.

86
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,290
So you can cross the line, too.

87
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:34,980
If you cross the line, you can sometimes see other things.

88
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:40,350
Go to Uhm Se Yoon.

89
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,220
Don't make a mistake like me.

90
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,730
If you don't tell her,

91
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,000
she will never know how you feel.

92
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:01,530
The contract.

93
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:08,320
Rest up today and we'll talk tomorrow. And sign the contract.

94
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,850
 Shin Seo Jung!

95
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,460
 Shin Seo Jung! Won't you come to your senses?

96
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,310
 Why are you being like this nowadays?

97
00:08:45,310 --> 00:08:47,470
 Oh, Don Hyuk.

98
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,690
 Sorry. I'm just a mess...

99
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:01,330
 So all the rumors are true then?

100
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,510
 Are you being like this because of that right now?

101
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,810
 Are you going to believe me if I tell you it's not true?

102
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,340
 I told you I'll believe you!

103
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:25,160
 Seo Jung, I'll believe you.

104
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:27,960
 Hurry and tell me.

105
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,310
 Tell me!

106
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:39,680
 Don Hyuk, just...

107
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:45,980
 Can't you believe that those pictures aren't of me?

108
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,270
 It must have been hard.

109
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,890
 I'll be with you.

110
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,090
 And move on...

111
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,680
 like it never happened?

112
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:06,730
 So, you can't tell me until the end?

113
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:39,160
It wasn't that I couldn't believe Seo Jung.

114
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,840
I was simply angry that I couldn't be the person she needed.

115
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:48,680
The heart that couldn't leave

116
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,170
is powerless.

117
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:37,410
Hey, Park Chan Young. Why do you keep following me?

118
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,820
Se Yoon, I...

119
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,790
like you!

120
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,350
I really, really like you.

121
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,700
I really like you, but...

122
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,460
So...

123
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:16,460
So, I have to cross a line, but... I—

124
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,630
I know that you like me.

125
00:12:40,070 --> 00:12:46,390
♫  Back then, it just felt slow  ♫

126
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:52,550
♫  But when I returned, it was a moment  ♫

127
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,770
Let's get drunk, let's get drunk.

128
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,990
Let's make our souls drunk.

129
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:06,750
With 21 grams,

130
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:12,460
we can get drunk on comforting tears instead of alcohol.

131
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:18,440
With a close big sis,

132
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:22,850
we would play this game when we got fresh air after we got bored of drawing.

133
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,790
Our love is...

134
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,750
boiling like that pot.

135
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:39,130
So, let's cool off under a palm tree.

136
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:42,270
- Oh, you're good.
 - I do well, right?

137
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,160
You're pretty good.

138
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,610
Our ending will most likely be...

139
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,450

140
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,860

141
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:13,950
That day, did nothing happen with Kim Dae Yong?

142
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,560
Yeah.

143
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:20,530
Although I did get annoyed when he made jokes that weren't funny.

144
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,460
Sorry.

145
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,320
It's strange.

146
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,040
Why am I at ease when I'm with you?

147
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:42,620
I'm not thinking of any worries.

148
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:07,830

149
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,690
Hey, Chan Hong, that's made in 1990!

150
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,850
I told you to throw away all the junk already.

151
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,450
What are you talking about?

152
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:25,990
After I work on it, it will work for another 100 years.

153
00:15:26,790 --> 00:15:29,200
Yea, so you can will it to your son?

154
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,710
All done.

155
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:34,990
Oh, you want to use this for real?

156
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,510
Does it play automatically?

157
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:41,960
Of course. Hey, this is an item with a story to Dad.

158
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,720
See these scratches in the corner?

159
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,260
When I see these things, I am reminded of back then.

160
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:53,780
If I exaggerate,

161
00:15:54,620 --> 00:16:00,550
it's like I'm sharing my life slightly with you.

162
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,940
Want to give it a listen?

163
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:06,900
Wow. Lee Ji Yeon.

164
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,570
Back in our time, she was a goddess. Pretty, right?

165
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,640
Here.

166
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:19,470
You know these... They don't have the sound quality of an MP3 or CD and are more cumbersome,

167
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,460
but when one side is finished and you turn it over,

168
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:27,850
at that moment, how should I say it?  It's like this singer's life.

169
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:31,160
You'll sort of get involved with it.

170
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,380
A side. B side. When they decide on the order of songs,

171
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:39,140
what kind of process did this singer go through in deciding? It makes you think.

172
00:16:40,350 --> 00:16:41,750
Dad.

173
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,580
You speak like a poet.

174
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,280
Really?

175
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,700
I guess I take after you, Dad.

176
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,530
Thanks. For saying you take after me.

177
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:20,440
♫  Since I came to know you I came to understand love   ♫

178
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:25,230
♫  As if this world is now  mine, as my heart blossoms  ♫

179
00:17:26,450 --> 00:17:32,460
♫  Like those birds in the sky, I felt I could fly, too  ♫

180
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,510
 Spring flowers do not fear withering.

181
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:44,180
♫  As such our Spring meeting neared us    ♫

182
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:50,160
 They do not worry about bearing fruits in the fall.

183
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,130
♫  On one late autumn day, I saw  ♫

184
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:03,130
♫  Your eyes that seemed dampened like the dew   ♫

185
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,510
♫  Saying you are leaving for a trip   ♫

186
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:14,840
 They just bloom, each in their own way.

187
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:41,400
 Accepting it will only be brief, they just bloom.

188
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,490
Wet sand remembers footsteps.

189
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,590
Yep.

190
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:52,190
That line from your poem.

191
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:59,450
It was the same as the line Seo Jung who died sent me last.

192
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,400
That's why I wanted to tell you.

193
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,880
Actually I didn't have the courage so I agonized over this.

194
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,490
But now I want to be more honest.

195
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,110

196
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:36,700
Before she died, she had put it in my locker.

197
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:40,030
 That's true.

198
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:46,320
 If you love a princess, the option of dying by poison follows you.

199
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:52,370
You're nuts. At last you've gone nuts for good.

200
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:55,730
Hey, crazy! Where are you going?

201
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,360
We have to hurry and go to Bro Don Hyuk.

202
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:04,230
Never. If he finds out it was Se Yoon who had it, it'll be chaos.

203
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:07,440
Hey, do you remember anything? You don't, right?

204
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,510
But you pulled some shit and agreed to the contract, right?

205
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:12,810
This will solve things nice and neat. Let's go.

206
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:15,000
No, I said!

207
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:20,510
So? You shall hold the bomb and expire?

208
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,550
My god!  What a natural choice!

209
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:25,310
I praise you so much, dear Mr. Chan Hong!

210
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:29,860
If you get caught having this, Bro Don Hyuk will either rip you to pieces or grind you in a blender.

211
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,470
No one will be able to find your corpse in this world.

212
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:36,300
I don't care. Se Yoon is more important to me.

213
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:39,290
I snatched it from her because it seems dangerous to have it.

214
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,220
"Se Yoon is more important to me."

215
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,490
Shit some crap, why don't you!

216
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:48,120
Are you watching romance movies lately? Like your first love is your last love, that stuff?

217
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,180
What are we going to do about your promising youth!

218
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,860
What is it?

219
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,790
 When should we meet? I'm prepared to hear it.

220
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:57,680
Look at that! See!

221
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:59,750
Ninja, I wish you well.

222
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,820
You better get an amulet. It was fun knowing you.

223
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,190
Hey, Ninja.

224
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:19,330
Let's do this. Half-truth and half made up shit.

225
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:22,940
Is it really possible?

226
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:26,210
With this, how do we find the people she met?

227
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:30,950
You will soon find out how dangerous a smart phone really is.

228
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,900
Hey, the email is on auto-login, you said. Right?  So check.

229
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,760
Yep.

230
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:42,680
Oh. It's here.

231
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,550
Ta-da. What did I tell you?

232
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:54,860
Hacking? You don't have to know about that stuff.

233
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:58,550

234
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,090
She was so pretty, wasn't she?

235
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:04,850
Look at the way she smiles.

236
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,710
Yep.

237
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,840

238
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,140
This is starting to smell fishy.

239
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,590

240
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:30,370
Bingo. Mr. Chan Hong, you must believe in this Oh Kyung Pyo.

241
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:34,920
Okay. Let's see.

242
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:39,380
This guy's account is already dead.

243
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,460
The pictures they sent to each other.

244
00:22:47,990 --> 00:22:50,970
He looks fine enough.

245
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:56,220

246
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,580
He loves private accounts, doesn't he?

247
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,610
Here, let's each make a foreigner account and ask to be a follower and wait.

248
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:04,390
Why a foreigner account?

249
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,480
If the applicant is a foreigner, they are less suspicious.

250
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,560
Plus a girl, then it's total defense down.

251
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:15,450
You're dead.

252
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,690
 When you're done, suddenly say you remember.

253
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,960
 Leak some important points furtively.

254
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,720
 He's taken the bait.

255
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,400
 He's a total SNS addict.

256
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,920
 He uploads every hour.

257
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,160
 Name: Kang Hyun Goo.

258
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,900
 I guess he was a good student. He's an art major at Korea University.

259
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,960
 And ta-da!

260
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:49,560
What? That's our school uniform.

261
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:53,320
Then, he knew Shin Seo Jung.

262
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,880
We'll have to ask him in person then.

263
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,980
Can we actually accomplish that?

264
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,370
Hey,  you said not to get Bro Don Hyuk no matter what.

265
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:03,650
That's a definite no.

266
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,560
Then...

267
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,270
Operation start?

268
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,350
Same one we used to do?

269
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:17,640
Teacher, it hurts so much.

270
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,420
You took some fever meds so it should come down soon.

271
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,440
Ugh...

272
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,980
Hey. She's gone?

273
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:32,540
Yep. Hurry.

274
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,180
Hot.

275
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:43,260
But Ninja, how many times have you gone to Seoul again?

276
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,770
Like five times. Why?

277
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:54,120
Well, I hear you can't get off the train sometimes in Seoul because too many people are on the subway.

278
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:57,050
Is that really true? It's not, right?

279
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:00,680
I went with my parents, too, so I'm not sure.

280
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,900
But there are lots of people for sure and lots of subways, too.

281
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,770
- Hey, give me your cellphone. 
- What for?

282
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:08,450
Hurry.

283
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,360
Don't do anything weird.

284
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,250
I know.

285
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,920
What are you doing?

286
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,230
Something. Something to protect you and me.

287
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:26,370
Done.

288
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,830
Couple location app? Why?

289
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,830
Spouses are one in the body.

290
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:35,240
Twelve years of friendship is basically married.

291
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,500
I love you, Park Chan Hong.

292
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,910
You wacko.

293
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,590
Hey, don't erase it.

294
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:44,680
I get lost easily. Don't delete it.

295
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,590
Bro, you're here.

296
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,920
Yep.

297
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,290
Here, I got it started.

298
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:00,500
Crazy bastard.

299
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,360
What?

300
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,310
Crazy psycho bastard.

301
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:08,880
Here, let's get ready. Hot.

302
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:25,040
My legs.

303
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,980
Hey, you said you came to Seoul lots of times.

304
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,880
Bro Don Hyuk doesn't seem to know the roads either so do something quickly.

305
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:37,180
Hey, this is my first time in this neighborhood, too.

306
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:40,430
But how come he just keeps walking?

307
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:44,320
How many times have we gone through this back and forth?

308
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,800
Did we come to Seoul to walk?

309
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:51,290
Isn't he tired at all? He's not Ironman for no reason.

310
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:01,560
Taxi!

311
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:07,270
If we were going to do this we should've done this sooner.

312
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,210
Taxi! Hurry.

313
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:14,460
- Taxi!
 - Taxi!

314
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:26,890
Hey, are you sure it's this lesson? What if it's not?

315
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:28,860
Don't worry.

316
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,950
#lesson apply #studious mode

317
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:35,610
No one asked but he kindly told everyone his schedule.

318
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:37,400
"Understanding abstract art."

319
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,540
Art Department class 105, Professor Kim Myeong Hee.

320
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:45,520
Wow, King-Psycho, for the first time, I realize how useful you are.

321
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:49,900
Bro, wait just a bit.

322
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,740
I will risk my life and get that rascal.

323
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:56,030
Hey, hey!  It's him, right?

324
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,650
Oh, it is!

325
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:01,180
 She was with a guy with a tattoo on the ankle.

326
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,530
I have to check if there's a tattoo on his ankle.

327
00:28:03,530 --> 00:28:05,570
Bro!

328
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:08,790
Bro, you stand out being so big.

329
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:12,180
Look, only you look like a PE major here.

330
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,840
With this hand, art major?

331
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,350
How would you grab a brush, you would have to grab a bat or rod.

332
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:19,470
- Right? 
- What?

333
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:23,410
What? I meanis...

334
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,490
You're too big and I'm too unique.

335
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:31,430
Ninja, you're the only one. Go.

336
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,090
Hello.

337
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,730
What do I do?

338
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,640
Go in.

339
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,050
Hello!

340
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:49,450
 Hello!

341
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,660
- Down.
 - Down!

342
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:55,690
Train. One. Fighting.

343
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,510
Ready.

344
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:03,250
Excuse me.

345
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:08,760
I... You're Bro Hyung Goo, right? Jaeil graduate.

346
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,940
Who...

347
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:16,510
I'm Hong Chan. Park Hong Chan. An art major junior to you.

348
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:20,060
Oh, I see. What's this for?

349
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,640
You know Seo Jung, right? Shin Seo Jung.

350
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,040
Shin Seo Jung?

351
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:28,020
What about Seo Jung?

352
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,470
Is there?

353
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:48,720
Is there? The other side.

354
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,500
No. There isn't.

355
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:57,540
What's that?

356
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,370

357
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,250
 Oh, I totally forgot.

358
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:25,380
 The more fragrant the flower, the more it's not just the butterflies that come around.

359
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:29,770
 Bees with toxins and all sorts of insects come following, too.

360
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,400
 Fuck.

361
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:41,240

362
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,570

363
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,390

364
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:48,200

365
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,090

366
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,570

367
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:56,540

368
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,650

369
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,640

370
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:10,570

371
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:19,190

372
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:20,600

373
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:24,960
♫  My friend, let's get this party started   ♫

374
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,190
♫  My friend, let's get this party started   ♫

375
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:30,330
♫  You don't have to talk  ♫

376
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:33,320
♫  I already understood you   ♫

377
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:38,000
♫  My friend, let's get this party started   ♫

378
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,350
 Why are you doing something you never did before?

379
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:44,780
 They took pictures and extorted money?

380
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,510
 I told you I will kill you for real if you lie, right?

381
00:32:46,510 --> 00:32:49,830
 Kiss? The kiss is about timing. A fight with timing.

382
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:54,500
 Sometimes the faint mishaps create perfect harmony.

383
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:58,040
 Those words on the date forum. They weren't written by her.

384
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,970
 If we follow the trail of those bastards trying to get Uhm Se Yoon.

385
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:02,110
 That's a definite no. That's too dangerous for Se Yoon.

386
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:07,240
 The day Shin Seo Jung died, you were at school, too!

387
00:33:07,910 --> 00:33:09,800
♫  You and I we go back it's hard for me  ♫
