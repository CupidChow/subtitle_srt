1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:09,970

2
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:35,730
I think he's gone.

3
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,080
 Kiss? Kiss is about timing. In the end, a battle with timing.

4
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:54,210
 You have to catch the signal at the speed of a blade when the girl sends you the message to come in.

5
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:56,170
 You go in on an offbeat?

6
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:58,470
 You get a cheek slap and it's bye-bye right away.

7
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,060
 How do you know that signal though?

8
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,810
 You know who Edward Hall?

9
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,500
 - Proximity theory?
- What?

10
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,290
 Hey, write this down if you don't know.

11
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,120
 According to Hall,

12
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,480
 humans have something called intimate distance.

13
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,650
 About 45 cm. About one and half a footstep.

14
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,510
 It's not opened to just anyone.

15
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:20,590
 But if you go in there and not back out?

16
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:24,210
 You go in two-times the speed then you have to slow down.

17
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:25,850
 Why?

18
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,590
 Are you the only one going? She needs to come, too.

19
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:34,050
 Rascal! Love is not a one-way street.

20
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:38,530
 This reminds me suddenly.

21
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:41,420
 Flowers flying around.

22
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,320
 Her breathing sound. Her soft lips.

23
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,000
 But you never did it anyway.

24
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,650
 Note-tube.

25
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,520
 Hey, write it down.

26
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,330
She was supposed to go meet,

27
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,340
at Naeng-Kim shop by Boram Street.

28
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,130
Naeng-Kim?

29
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,350

30
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,430
Naengmyeon (cold noodle) plus Kimbap (seaweed roll).

31
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:10,080
The actual name of the shop is "Our Snack."

32
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,420
That menu is so famous,

33
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,000
so everyone calls it like that.

34
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,990
I think it's only our school kids that call it that.

35
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,040
So this person is in our school.

36
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:31,540
But how do you know who wrote it?

37
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,390
There is a way.

38
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:37,370
 The cabinet is in the middle of the office.

39
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,310
 If you distract them,

40
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,930
 I'll get it real quick and leave.

41
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,810
- Teacher.
- You're here again.

42
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:51,040
Can you please let me see what my friends wrote, just once?

43
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,480
I said no.

44
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:55,280
You know their level so why do you want to read these?

45
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,520
 Document Storage. Kids have privacy so it's definitely no.

46
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,100
You startled me.

47
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:15,050
- What is it, Don Hyuk.
- I have something I need to discuss with you.

48
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:18,630
- With me?
- Yes, so somewhere quiet.

49
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:21,030
Somewhere quiet?

50
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,220
I don't suppose you are not happy with me about something.

51
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,030
It's not that.

52
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,660
Why are you so startled? Are you helping Teacher?

53
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,670
What is it?

54
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,580
What?

55
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,360
What's happening over there?

56
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,640
What are you doing?

57
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,740
You rascals.

58
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,250
What is it, Teacher Choi?

59
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,560
- Teacher.
- My head.

60
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,380
Don Hyuk!

61
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,090
Chan Hong. Park Chan Hong!

62
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:06,950
- Yes.
- Get the nurse here.

63
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,930
Are you...? I think you're feverish.

64
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,300
- Why are you touching me?
- Chan Hong!

65
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,840
Get the nurse!

66
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,900
Hurry!

67
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,660
Breathe. Breathe.

68
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,180
Chan Hong, no, it's okay.

69
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:26,380
No, no. Chan Hong, bring her.

70
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,460
Bring her. Hurry.

71
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:30,170
Stay still.

72
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:32,790
Chan Hong, no, it's okay.

73
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,250
Breathe. Breathe.

74
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,320
- When did this start?
- Yesterday.

75
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,790
Yesterday, did you eat something bad? What did you eat?

76
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:43,000
Chicken feet and soju.

77
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,340
- You should've called me. 
- What?

78
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,810
No, I mean, what are your symptoms?

79
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:50,900
My head really hurts.

80
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:54,560
Head?

81
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,190
 It was my life's first thieving act.

82
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,110
Bro, you're place is a hot place for ramen.

83
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,370
Why did you fold down all the names?

84
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,210
So we don't have any bias.

85
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:44,270
Is this actually possible though?

86
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,260
This is yours, right?

87
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,250
- How did you know? 
- It's got something humid and filthy about it.

88
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:56,990
Seriously!

89
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,470

90
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:48,810

91
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,220

92
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,010

93
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,360

94
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,410
Choi Mira.

95
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,860

96
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,960

97
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:32,130
You know, about Choi Mira.

98
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,930
You are sensitive, for sure.

99
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,630
Maybe because you're a writer?

100
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,450
Mira is a bit like that lately.

101
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:47,620
She's kind of aloof with me lately and she seems gloomy.

102
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,580
You know...

103
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:01,300
Never mind.

104
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,150
Later.

105
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,080
- Let's talk about it later.
- What?

106
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,100
Your birthday is November, right?

107
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,800
How did you know?

108
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,730
That author has the same birthday as you.

109
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:27,940
November 22th.

110
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,580
I was going to wait and give it to you but it's so far away.

111
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,830
Thank you. I've got nothing though.

112
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,010
But write me a letter by hand instead.

113
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,480
I want to have something written by you.

114
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:51,470
- I'll write it for sure.
- It's a promise then.

115
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:31,340
♫  Baby says   ♫

116
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:35,420
♫  I can't come   ♫

117
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,740
♫  with him   ♫

118
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,360
♫  And I   ♫

119
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,100
♫  have read all of this  ♫

120
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,660
♫  in his eyes  ♫

121
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,960
♫  Take care  ♫

122
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:15,760
♫  I've been hurt before  ♫

123
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,890
 It was my first kiss.

124
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:21,070
♫  Too much time spent  ♫

125
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:23,400
 The world halted.

126
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,070
 And all my senses

127
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,280
 became sensitive.

128
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,390
 And all these moments,

129
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:35,030
 will perhaps likely

130
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,610
 be unforgettable to me until I die.

131
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:46,080
♫  You know I will be just   ♫

132
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:52,610
♫  as quiet as when I leave  ♫

133
00:10:54,580 --> 00:11:01,960
♫  as I was when I first   ♫

134
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:07,050
♫  got here  ♫

135
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:13,570
♫  and don't expect anything  ♫

136
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:18,060
♫  and don't expect anything  ♫

137
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,480
Come here! Come!

138
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,490
Hey, bastard!

139
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,240
You bastard, are you nuts?

140
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,020
What the hell are you trying to do?

141
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:26,030
Are you all right?

142
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,400
You pathetic bastard.

143
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,390
You still haven't felt anything?

144
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:40,060
The kid you bullied saved you.

145
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:44,220
You don't get angry. You say thank you, you idiot.

146
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:52,160
You come here often lately.

147
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,290
Thank you.

148
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,460
Are you all right?

149
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,690
It's not too deeply cut, fortunately.

150
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:26,080
You know...

151
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,500
Here.

152
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,360
I'll enjoy it, thanks.

153
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:47,260
Thanks.

154
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:50,740
Rest up.

155
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,860
Chan Hong.

156
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,600
Huh?

157
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,330
You're close to Uhm Se Yoon, right?

158
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,390
Yep, why?

159
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,190
Just that...

160
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,660
Kim Dae Yong, I mean.

161
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,400
He seems to be looking for the pink phone Uhm Se Yoon has.

162
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,300
There's nothing special no matter how I look.

163
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,450
As you said, there's definitely something in here,

164
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,930
so they're trying to snatch it.

165
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:36,100
There are two calculators.

166
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:40,710
Look. There are two calculator apps.

167
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,810
I opened them and they're similar in function.

168
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,920

169
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,620
What is this?

170
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,090
What did she film?

171
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:18,330
Who is that woman?

172
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,050
Kim Dae Yong wrote that message, too, I think.

173
00:15:31,050 --> 00:15:33,400
That's why you couldn't find it.

174
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,360
That bastard wouldn't have done homework.

175
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,090
- Don Hyuk, calm down first and let's think.
- This is our chance.

176
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:44,000
Those bastards. We can get their tails.

177
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,050
- If we tail the bastards that are trying to catch Uhm Se Yoon.
- That's a definite no.

178
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:49,710
It would be too dangerous for Se Yoon.

179
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:53,290
- She's already in plenty danger.
- I will...

180
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,250
I will protect her with my life.

181
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,170
Just believe me once.

182
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,280
Hey, Heo Don Hyuk, this is definitely not it.

183
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,670
Just one day.

184
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:12,330
- Then just give me one day. 
- And what if something happens tonight?

185
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,510
Park Chan Hong,

186
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,950
I will protect her with everything even if I die.

187
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,020
You're still just a high school kid no matter what.

188
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,930
You are also a high school student.

189
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:37,320
If you don't, I'll do it myself.

190
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,330
I'll go do it myself.

Telling me, "Oh my, President Jo."

199

What can that be?

200
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:23,620
It means I, Jo Pyeong Seop, am going to win the election.

201

Right?

202
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:39,860
Everyone's telling me I will win.

203
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,550
Why do I feel so uneasy?

204
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:48,350
Oh right. That cellphone.

205
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:50,750
With the video in it,

206
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,910
what about an election?

207
00:17:52,910 --> 00:17:56,350
You and I will hold hands and go to jail, right?

208
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,250
I'm sorry.

209
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,750
Did I ask you to go find money?

210
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,820
Did I ask you to go gather votes?

211
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,420
I'm telling you to go find a mere cellphone,

212
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,800
that puts a badge on me and suits on you.

213
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,150
You can't take care of that?

214
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:22,310
I'll plead then.

215
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,490
Help me, please.

216
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:33,280
Uhm Se, so you're here.

217
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,240
Oh, Mira.

218
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:39,210
Sorry, everyone. I've been kind of sensitive lately, right?

219
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:44,000
No, I mean, something happened with my mom and dad, and I wasn't feeling well,

220
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,660
so I didn't have energy. Sorry. Sorry to everyone.

221
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,970
I'm sorry.

222
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,820
Sorry. By the way,

223
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:55,770
this is a new app for photos. Have you tried it? It's so cute.

224
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:01,500
One, two, three.

225
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,500
Looks good, right?

226
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:06,330
One, two, three.

227
00:19:06,330 --> 00:19:08,480
Gather in.

228
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,730

229
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,790

230
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,790

231
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,650
What?

232
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,520
I have something to ask you.

233
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,390
What is it?

234
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,590
When you write,

235
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,330
you use "dot-dot-dot" a lot, right?

236
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:53,120
Oh, I do, but why?

237
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,470
- Let me see your cellphone.
- Why should I show you?

238
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,330
Choi Mira.

239
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,950
It was you, right?

240
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,860
What is?

241
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:11,180
The dating bulletin message. You wrote it, right?

242
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,140
No. I didn't! I didn't!

243
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,760
Stop lying.

244
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,300
It was you who wrote it.

245
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:26,110
I didn't. I didn't, I said.

246
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:30,510
The dating bulletin words.

247
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:34,550
You wrote it though, Choi Mira.

Why didn't you tell me?

I was worried you'd worry.

263
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,890
 The phone is off and you will be connected to the voicebox.

264
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:17,020
 After the beep your message will be charged as sent.

265
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,100
Why isn't she answering the phone?

266
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,320
I'm going to go alone today.

267
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:30,130
- I'll walk you back. 
- No, just go.

268
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:32,160
I want to be alone, I said.

269
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:37,630
I was worried, that's why. Worried.

270
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:40,120
That you might be in danger.

271
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:44,360
Aren't I just a liar to you, too?

272
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,940
What's different between me and Mira?

273
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,260
I thought wrong.

274
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,340
Give me back Seo Jung's phone again.

275
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,590
I'll keep it.

276
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,190
Hello?

277
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,070
What, Mira?

278
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,920

279
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:39,220
I don't think there's any major issue since they rescued her quickly.

280
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:41,910
Find out if we can get medical insurance on it.

281
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,730
Why are you telling me that?

282
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:48,380
Did you ever look after the child?

283
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,720
In middle school,

284
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,110
when you saw my graffiti and talked to me,

285
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,430
I was so happy.

286
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,550
When you said, "You're good at drawing, too."

287
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:24,070
You know, I was so shy and reserved.

288
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:28,410
I had no friends, right?

289
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:31,500
When you were popular back then, too.

290
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:38,110
So I knew it was a push but I begged my mom.

291
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:40,810
To send me to art academy.

292
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:45,560
You were nice to me,

293
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,370
and everyone treated me differently.

294
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:54,020
"The small kid by Se Yoon."

295
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,460
"Uhm Se Yoon's friend."

296
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:07,300
But I guess I was anxious.

297
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,070
 Yep.

298
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,260
 Stronger here.

299
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,830
 That I might go back to how it was before.

300
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:23,680
 I was scared of it.

301
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,290
 Hey, it's incredible.

302
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,550
 - Did you eat?
- I haven't.

303
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,180
 You?

304
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:33,810
 - I'm hungry.
- Yeah, I want to eat soon.

305
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:38,970
 So I started to hate it.

306
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:47,710
 She's someone with nothing to hate about.

307
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:50,240
 But that was more reason to hate.

308
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:04,000
I didn't know she would do that.

309
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,980
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

310
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,060
I didn't know she would.

311
00:26:12,390 --> 00:26:18,190
Sorry.

312
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:34,050
 I think it's every Wednesday.

313
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,810
 On other days, they summon day and night.

314
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:39,240
 But it's quiet on that day.

315
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:42,420
 So I'd always wait for Wednesday.

316
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:37,590
I found it, Chan Hong. I think it's that direction.

317
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:41,580
Look at his face well. I think he's involved.

318
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,850
Who is he?

319
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,650
You know him?

320
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:47,420
Before, briefly.

321
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,770
And that bastard is the one who showed me the writing, too.

322
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:52,040
I think he's involved.

323
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,940
I really don't know.

324
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,160
I want to quit. I'll report it to the police.

325
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,170
You can't.

326
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:08,630
I explained already. I won't let it harm Uhm Se Yoon.

327
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:10,970
I'll protect her with my life. So, Chan Hong.

328
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:12,610
Protect?

329
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,620
Protect what?

330
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,880
Choi Mira almost died, too.

331
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,660
Se Yoon might go bad, too.

332
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,310
Who is dying?

333
00:28:21,310 --> 00:28:23,760
What are you talking about?

334
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,020
Hey, Park Chan Hong.

335
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:30,600
You can't agree to a plea like this? From a friend?

336
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,040
Friend?

337
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:38,950
We are friends? We are in a contract relationship.

338
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,440
Park Chan Hong!

339
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,730
Stop that already.

340
00:28:55,490 --> 00:29:00,240
What if Se Yoon leaves?

341
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:04,050
Then she'll leave.

342
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,770
Uhm Se Yoon, with some Ninja like you.

343
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:10,440
You're right.

344
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:19,540
Our life with an answer that cannot be known.

345
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,960

346
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,970
 But since I have a friend by me,

347
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:32,970
 I shall try to let a bowl of liquor soothe me.

348
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,780
You're doing all sorts of stuff, being a writer.

349
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:39,160
You don't know? Game with signs.

350
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:43,550
Seo Jung and Se Yoon often played it.

351
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:46,360
I can understand.

352
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,900
What would a kid who's always fighting know about it?

353
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:02,000

354
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,370
 Footprints.

355
00:30:05,250 --> 00:30:06,660

356
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,000
 Remembered.

357
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:13,660

358
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:19,670
 Dampened sand.

359
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,410
 Remembers footsteps.

360
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:28,700

361
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:37,000
 Se Yoon.

362
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,420
 Under the public phone I left the hand-written letter.

363
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,880
 You wanted it.

364
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,950

365
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,960

366
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,740
 There is a girl.

367
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,060
 The girl is like the spring.

368
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,840

369
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,470
 She is like the red flower.

370
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:21,810

371
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:31,600
 When flower petals fall to the ground.

372
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,220
  When cherry blossoms burst in the summer heat.

373
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,430
 The girl has not forgotten.

374
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,910
 No, it's not true.

375
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:45,130
 The girl is like the summer.

376
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:56,200
 The girl gets scared.

377
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:01,830
 That she might be like the cold winter that is to come, too.

378
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:07,180
 That the chill might cut her.

379
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,420
 One, two, three.

380
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:47,120
 When spring comes again,

381
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:52,500
 will you be spring again?

382
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:59,500
♫  Help me if you hear this sound   ♫

383
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:06,370
♫  Keep your eyes wide open and look around   ♫

384
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:14,040

385
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,300

386
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:26,890

387
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,840
 Where's the cellphone?

388
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,960
 Don't say it. Or we'll all die.

389
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:41,990
 Uhm Se Yoon? You should save your girlfriend though.

390
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:43,710
 - Chan Hong!
- Se Yoon!

391
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,380
 Let's live a long time. Don't die and live for a long time.

392
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,050
 A long time, with friends.

393
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:51,400
 Cursing behind each other and fighting, too.

394
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,420
 Just live a long time.

395
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:56,410
 Why was it Seo Jung? Why Seo Jung of all?

396
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,060
 Your question is wrong.

397
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:02,310
 You should've asked who was the one who showed the pointer.

398
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,980
 You know that Shin Seo Jung that died, right?

399
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,560
 Why did you send her that text?

400
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,670
 ID, Mithra. That's you, right?
