00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,180
=My Name is Zhao Chuxi=

2
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,180
=Episode 4=

3
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,090
Which one should I choose?

4
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,170
Ms. Su, don't buy here.

5
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,050
Too expensive. Let's buy it by the roadside.

6
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,690
Okay.

7
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:22,850
Sir, I'll take both.

8
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:23,770
Okay, Ms. Su.

9
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,810
How much does it cost?

10
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:27,930
Keep guessing.

11
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,450
What?

12
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:33,570
Sir, what style do you want?

13
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,450
What's that?

14
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:38,410
Sir,

15
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,810
what kind of haircut do you want?

16
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:41,410
I want

17
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:46,210
to get a flat and neat crew cut

18
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:48,170
with the sides and top very even.

19
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,120
Sir,

20
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,890
that crew cut is too old-fashioned.

21
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:51,770
It's outdated.

22
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,170
Tin foil perms are trendy now.

23
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,130
Tony,

24
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:55,170
no need for that.

25
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,650
Just give him

26
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,970
that kind of professional look.

27
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:59,410
- Thanks.
- Alright, alright.

28
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:41,370
40 percent.

29
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,330
Ms. Su.

30
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,170
Is this still the Zhao Chuxi I know?

31
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,610
Truly, people rely on their attire.

32
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:49,690
You look respectable.

33
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,730
I have such a good foundation,

34
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,010
do I need your praise?

35
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,250
Not bad.

36
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:58,970
We have a dinner with several executives

37
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,010
from Hanhai Group at Jinhua Hotel tonight.

38
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:04,970
If tonight's dinner goes well,

39
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,610
the funding will be secured.

40
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,530
That's great.

41
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,690
You're going with me.

42
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,650
Sure.

43
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:11,730
Can you drink?

44
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,170
I can handle a bottle of 65-degree liquor.

45
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,210
Alright, that's fine.

46
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,770
Can you hold some drinks for me tonight?

47
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:19,850
No problem.

48
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,690
As long as it helps everyone get paid,

49
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,890
I wouldn't mind blocking drinks

50
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,970
or even blocking knives.

51
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,890
That's not needed.

52
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,610
Remember your identity.

53
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:27,850
My personal assistant.

54
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,930
Personal assistant?

55
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,890
I wear your clothes and I'm yours?

56
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,330
Alright, stop thinking and just go.

57
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:36,170
Get ready.

58
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,450
Are you hyperactive?

59
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,130
Anyway, we're all just waiting.

60
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,130
Let me have some fun.

61
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,490
When will you be able

62
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:52,370
to change your habit of looking around?

63
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,410
You don't understand.

64
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,290
I am keeping my eyes and ears open

65
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,930
to ensure Ms. Su's safety.

66
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,330
(Weimei Kitchen)
Yeah.

67
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:21,770
Princesses always need knights

68
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,530
to protect them.

69
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,490
Let me protect you today,

70
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,370
okay?

71
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:29,450
That's barely okay.

72
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,530
Long time no see, Xiluo.

73
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,370
Yeah.

74
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,010
Have you ever felt

75
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:39,370
chemistry is truly amazing?

76
00:04:39,810 --> 00:04:40,810
Like today,

77
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,810
we both independently chose black.

78
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:50,570
Shaoqing,

79
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,090
you're still so good at chatting.

80
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:55,570
It's about time.

81
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,410
Let's go inside.

82
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,290
- They're waiting.
- Okay.

83
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,130
Okay.

84
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:01,050
Everyone,

85
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,930
let's go!

86
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:09,250
- Is it fun?
- Fun.

87
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,130
I'm leading my fish to charge.

88
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,210
Who was it

89
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,410
that hugged Ms. Su

90
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,490
just as soon as he arrived?

91
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:23,970
His name is Xu Shaoqing.

92
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:25,930
He's Ms. Su's classmate from abroad.

93
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,290
He even pursued Ms. Su for a while.

94
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,940
He's the chairman of a major company.

95
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,690
This collaboration between Luoshen and Hanhai

96
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,970
was negotiated by him personally.

97
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,280
As a chairman of a major company,

98
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:35,410
he acted like a knight

99
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,970
and did that?

100
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,410
Hurry up, Zhao Chuxi.

101
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:39,810
Can you do well?

102
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,130
Don't worry.

103
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,210
No problem at all.

104
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:44,890
Let's go quickly. Everyone's waiting.

105
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,610
Everyone has arrived.

106
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,230
Everyone, take a seat. Don't stand.

107
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,730
Mr. Xu, please take a seat.

108
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,570
Before you come,

109
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,570
we dare not take a seat.

110
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,330
Yes, everyone's waiting for you.

111
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:58,970
Take a seat.

112
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,390
We're family. No need to be polite.

113
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,650
Please have a seat, everyone.

114
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:02,730
Xiluo, sit here.

115
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,210
Let me introduce you.

116
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,210
This is Xiluo, heiress to Luoshen Group.

117
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:23,690
Ms. Su was a star at school.

118
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,490
She just came back three years ago

119
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:28,770
and has already took hold in Jia City.

120
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,570
Ms. Su is truly a business genius.

121
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,410
Mr. Su received help from Mr. Xu this time.

122
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,090
She'll reach new heights in the future.

123
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,050
This is Mr. Gao.

124
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:40,290
He's a capital tycoon in our industry.

125
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,650
He previously worked hard on Wall Street.

126
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:44,010
Those times were hard.

127
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,650
He monitored the stock market daily

128
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,650
and managed over a hundred million in funds.

129
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,690
This is Mr. Shen.

130
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:51,290
He previously worked as China GM

131
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,490
at a large multinational company.

132
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,570
He's in charge of strategic investments.

133
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,490
This person next to Ms. Su

134
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,970
is Lu Yao, Ms. Su's secretary.

135
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,970
She's a graduate from Sanjiang University.

136
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,930
Now she is Ms. Su's strongest support.

137
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,050
This is...

138
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,650
This is my new assistant.

139
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,050
His name is Zhao Chuxi.

140
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:18,170
Come on.

141
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,490
Today I am very honored

142
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,970
to be able to bring everyone together

143
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:25,170
as a referrer.

144
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,610
Thank you all for trusting me.

145
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:32,210
I hope Hanhai and Luoshen can unite strongly

146
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,010
and achieve mutual success. Cheers.

147
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:34,850
Cheers.

148
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,050
Bottoms up.

149
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,050
Everyone must be hungry.

150
00:07:58,050 --> 00:07:58,930
Let's eat, come on.

151
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:06,450
Mr. Xu, I specially arranged the kitchen

152
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,910
to make sweet and sour pork for you.

153
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:08,850
Try some.

154
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,450
Thank you.

155
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,250
You still remember what I like to eat.

156
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:14,850
Mr. Xu,

157
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:16,170
this is the beef

158
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,890
we specially brought you from Mengdi.

159
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:18,850
Please have a taste.

160
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:19,850
Alright, I'll try.

161
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,570
A bunch of flatterers.

162
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,890
Eat more, talk less.

163
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:32,370
Xiluo.

164
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,090
I specifically

165
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:37,130
got these shrimp from Norway.

166
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,010
Take a taste.

167
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,330
Shaoqing,

168
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,850
did you forget I'm allergic to shrimp?

169
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:44,810
Chuxi,

170
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:45,970
here.

171
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:47,330
Eat this to fill your stomach.

172
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:48,450
Thank you, Ms. Su.

173
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,010
Ms. Su,

174
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:00,970
Mr. Xu is so good to you.

175
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,930
Shouldn't you toast Mr. Xu?

176
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,130
Mr. Gao is right.

177
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:06,970
Shaoqing,

178
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,570
I toast to you.

179
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,410
Alright.

180
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,570
To our acquaintance.

181
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:12,850
Thanks for your referral,

182
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:15,290
which facilitated this collaboration.

183
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:17,250
Xiluo, you're being too distant.

184
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,610
Helping you is just helping me.

185
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:20,650
Here.

186
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,970
The scene of Mr. Xu and Ms. Su

187
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,510
standing together is really beautiful.

188
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:32,850
Looks like Mr. Xu and Ms. Su have history.

189
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,970
How about a crossed cups toast?

190
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:47,730
Crossed cups toast!

191
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:49,090
Alright, alright, alright.

192
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,290
Xiluo is shy.

193
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:54,370
We can do a crossed cups toast anytime.

194
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,730
But it isn't quite appropriate today.

195
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:58,770
You continue.

196
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,890
Xiluo, have a seat.

197
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,770
Here, Ms. Su.

198
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,010
I toast to you.

199
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,210
You embody both talent and beauty.

200
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:08,810
A rising star in business.

201
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,730
Cheers.

202
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:17,170
Here's to you, Ms. Su.

203
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,690
From now on, you're my role model.

204
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,730
Ms. Su, I toast to you as well.

205
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,010
Wish Luoshen and Hanhai a strong partnership.

206
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:32,210
Wish you and Mr. Xu all the best.

207
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,050
Cheers.

208
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,330
Mr. Xu.

209
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:46,490
Excuse me.

210
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,530
Mr. E, I toast you.

211
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,130
My surname is Gao.

212
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,170
Yes.

213
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,810
Mr. E, no, Mr. Gao.

214
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:58,690
Under your leadership,

215
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:00,130
Hanhai Group is prospering.

216
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,570
I drink a toast to you.

217
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,490
Good things come in pairs.

218
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,650
Let me toast to you again.

219
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:25,010
May you life be auspicious!

220
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,490
I drink a toast to you, Mr. Li.

221
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,570
You're Zhao, huh?

222
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,820
- Xiluo.
- It's your turn.

223
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,730
Your assistant is quite the drinker.

224
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,410
I have lots of business to discuss later.

225
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,150
I need someone who can hold their liquor.

226
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,770
- Wish you a fortune.
- How about

227
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,250
letting him work with me?

228
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,610
You must be kidding.

229
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,490
Zhang's Group is such a big company.

230
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,210
There's no one like him?

231
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:47,370
Shaoqing,

232
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,010
a gentleman doesn't take what others love.

233
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,450
Well said.

234
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,230
We should have some drinks

235
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,530
for our friendship, right?

236
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:57,970
- Alright.
- Here.

237
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,650
This first cup is a toast

238
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,570
to the four years we spent in university.

239
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,690
Here.

240
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,490
The second cup.

241
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:13,570
Wish Hanhai and Luoshen smooth cooperation.

242
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,090
- Sure.
- Cheers.

243
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:19,850
The third cup

244
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:22,250
is to our bright future.

245
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,250
To the future.

246
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,450
Mr. Xu, I'll have a drink with you.

247
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:34,730
What are you exactly?

248
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,490
How dare you drink with me on Xiluo's behalf?

249
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:41,410
Mr. Xu, why are you getting upset?

250
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,250
How about this? If you are upset,

251
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:45,530
I'll toast you after I finish this, okay?

252
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:47,810
If you want to toast me,

253
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,330
wait for us to finish these three cups.

254
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:54,770
Xiluo, your subordinate is truly stupid.

255
00:12:59,130 --> 00:12:59,970
Shaoqing,

256
00:13:00,610 --> 00:13:02,490
I'll drink this cup with you, okay?

257
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,890
Okay, we need to drink three more cups.

258
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,450
The second cup, same as before.

259
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:18,970
Here.

260
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,650
The third cup is to our bright future.

261
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,570
Mr. Xu,

262
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:37,930
Ms. Su really can't handle her drinks.

263
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,970
Don't touch me.

264
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:41,930
Let me toast you with the third cup, alright?

265
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,650
Zhao, right?

266
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,570
It should be your first time to be here.

267
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,170
If you want to be a knight,

268
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:57,090
you have to have two cups.

269
00:13:58,970 --> 00:13:59,850
Alright.

270
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:16,050
Mr. Xu, can I toast you now?

271
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,330
Brat,

272
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,330
do you know the etiquette?

273
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,310
Do you think you can toast Mr. Xu

274
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,770
whenever you want?

275
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:28,370
Mr. Gao,

276
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,770
I'm truly sorry.

277
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,890
Zhao has never been to these parties.

278
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,090
Then, this cup...

279
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,010
Xiluo.

280
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:36,770
Brat,

281
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:38,970
you like drinking, huh?

282
00:14:39,530 --> 00:14:40,370
Alright.

283
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:50,850
Still want a drink?

284
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:55,010
Drink.

285
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,490
Fine.

286
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:03,850
Still want a drink?

287
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,170
Drink.

288
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,610
That's enough.

289
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,770
You two might have forgotten

290
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:23,530
this is the celebration banquet.

291
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,650
If you want to compete in drinking,

292
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,060
I'll give you a chance

293
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,370
another day.

294
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,730
Since Xiluo has spoken

295
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,050
and you've already had enough,

296
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:38,770
if I keep drinking with you,

297
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,730
it seems I'm bullying you.

298
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,810
Let's stop for today.

299
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,530
If you want to drink,

300
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:47,010
I'll stick with you next time.

301
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,490
Mr. Xu,

302
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,170
you're good at handling things.

303
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:53,130
You also enjoy having drinks.

304
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,120
If you want to have drinks with me later,

305
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,090
I will come

306
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:58,690
whenever you need.

307
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,210
I'm not drinking. I'm hungry.

308
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,170
I'm eating.

309
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,250
That's it for today.

310
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:27,410
- Okay.
- Let's enjoy our drinks

311
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,510
(Weimei Kitchen)
at my place.

312
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,380
Alright.

313
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,890
About that project...

314
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:33,890
Then I'll leave first.

315
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:34,890
Take it slow.

316
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:35,850
Bye.

317
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,450
- Take care.
- Bye.

318
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,410
Bye.

319
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:42,850
Xiluo, are you okay?

320
00:16:42,850 --> 00:16:44,330
Let me send you home.

321
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,330
Let's go.

322
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,170
Mr. Xu.

323
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:51,250
You're so busy.

324
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,050
You should head back to work early.

325
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:54,570
I'm fine.

326
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,610
I can handle with it.

327
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:57,770
Bye.

328
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,170
Mr. Xu, I...

329
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,930
I'm always here when you need me.

330
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:05,570
Always be here.

331
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,370
Always...

332
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:16,610
Always be here, huh?

333
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,930
What the hell!

334
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,330
Can't you hear me?

335
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,050
Help me find someone.

336
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,610
Zhao Chuxi.

337
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:45,890
Drink!

338
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,370
Why just you two?

339
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,850
Shall we continue?

340
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:52,490
I'll just drink.

341
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,290
I'll keep drinking with you two.

342
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,130
Let's drink!

343
00:17:58,690 --> 00:17:59,810
Ms. Su, are you alright?

344
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,490
I'm okay.

345
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,970
What about him then?

346
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,050
I'll handle it. You go back first.

347
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,130
Alright.

348
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:17,330
We'll be very busy these days.

349
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,370
Get some rest soon.

350
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:19,330
Take it easy.

351
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,890
Are you done throwing up?

352
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,290
Who threw up? I didn't.

353
00:18:30,810 --> 00:18:31,810
I told you to drink,

354
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,130
but I didn't ask you to overdo it.

355
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,370
Ms. Su,

356
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:37,690
you don't understand me.

357
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:40,850
In my hometown,

358
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,210
I can drink three bottles of the local spirit

359
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:47,970
brewed by the village chief.

360
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,530
Today

361
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:53,170
is my first time trying such fine wine.

362
00:18:54,010 --> 00:18:55,070
I was not quite used to it.

363
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,570
I didn't do my best.

364
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,170
You're so stubborn.

365
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,890
I never knew

366
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,120
how you deal with such parties

367
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,530
all these years.

368
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:08,850
I have no choice.

369
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:11,690
I've been running the branch all by myself.

370
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,570
If you want to settle in this city,

371
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:14,770
having drinks isn't a big deal.

372
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,810
When we drank today,

373
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,730
there were so many dishes.

374
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:22,530
But we just drank.

375
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,810
After drinking, we left.

376
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,570
No one took the food.

377
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:26,650
It's a waste.

378
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,850
If it weren't

379
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,570
for considering you,

380
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,970
I really wanted to get it to go

381
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,610
and take it back, you know?

382
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:36,690
I'll bring it back for the coworkers,

383
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,990
Erpang, Sanqiang, and the others.

384
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,610
Enjoy it.

385
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:40,730
Delicious.

386
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,530
You're still thinking about your coworkers.

387
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:44,970
Erpang and Sanqiang are my brothers.

388
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:47,010
They treat me great, absolutely.

389
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,410
I really envy them

390
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,170
for having such a good friend like you.

391
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,490
Absolutely, it's my good luck.

392
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:56,930
Ms. Su,

393
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:00,290
just go...

394
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:02,010
Go home.

395
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:03,770
Pack up.

396
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,410
I'm leaving.

397
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:07,290
Where are you going?

398
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,650
I'm heading back to the site.

399
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,490
Otherwise, I only

400
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:14,050
have 20 yuan. I can't afford to the hotel.

401
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,490
I can't sleep on the street.

402
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:18,490
Let's do it this way.

403
00:20:19,090 --> 00:20:19,970
Stay at my home.

404
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:23,090
I'll ask Ms. Wu to prepare a guest room.

405
00:20:24,330 --> 00:20:25,370
You stay in the guest room.

406
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,290
You have only 20 yuan.

407
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,710
I can't let you sleep on the street.

408
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,790
You can't go back like this.

409
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,370
Let's go.

410
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,170
It's not right.

411
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,450
It's not right.

412
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,270
Let's consider it a compensation

413
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:37,410
for your performance tonight.

414
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,250
Let's go.

415
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,610
Can you get up?

416
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,610
Absolutely.

417
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,890
I can still keep drinking.

418
00:20:42,890 --> 00:20:43,810
Come on.

419
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:45,450
Let's go.

420
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,290
Be careful.

421
00:21:29,510 --> 00:21:31,370
(During these days together,)

422
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,810
(Zhao Chuxi admired)

423
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:37,170
(Su Xiluo's resilience)

424
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,090
(in such a competitive business environment)

425
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,850
(and was especially impressed by the courage)

426
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,810
(she showed in the face of difficulties.)

427
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:46,690
(Unknowingly,)

428
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,050
(he had an inexplicable feeling for her.)

429
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:11,770
Chuxi,

430
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,130
time for breakfast.

431
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,010
Chuxi, you're awake.

432
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:43,970
Yeah.

433
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:47,130
Why so many dishes in the morning?

434
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,170
So delicious!

435
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,970
I didn't know what you like to eat,

436
00:22:49,970 --> 00:22:51,410
so I had Ms. Wu prepare some more.

437
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,250
A rich family's breakfast

438
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,010
is as good as dinner.

439
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:56,930
You eat first. I'm off to work.

440
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,410
If you need anything, call me.

441
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:00,610
- Don't you want some?
- I've already eaten.

442
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:01,730
Eat slowly, don't choke.

443
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,730
Yeah.

444
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:17,330
Ms. Wu, Ms. Wu.

445
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,490
Mr. Zhao, what's up?

446
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,610
There's still this much left.

447
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:24,210
Ms. Su doesn't eat it?

448
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:26,250
Ms. Su never eats leftovers.

449
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:28,690
Don't want these dishes anymore?

450
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:29,690
No.

451
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,690
Can you help me pack it?

452
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,690
Of course.

453
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,090
I'll get you a to-go box.

454
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:35,330
Thanks, Ms. Wu.

455
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,050
Erpang loves this.

456
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:41,810
Sanqiang loves the fried food.

457
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,370
It must be good with the steamed buns.

458
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,970
They're not enough for them.

459
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,650
I'd better not eat.

460
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,850
Let me pack it and eat together.

461
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:00,410
Hey, you!

462
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,810
What are you looking at?

463
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:03,290
Hurry up and eat.

464
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,090
Chuxi,

465
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:09,250
tell the truth.

466
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:12,370
You didn't come back all night yesterday.

467
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:16,410
Did you sell your body for money?

468
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,770
You look so tired.

469
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,650
Did you compromise yourself?

470
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:20,490
Yeah.

471
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,020
I really have sold myself.

472
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,010
You hooked up with a rich girl so quickly?

473
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:27,690
Did you move this fast?

474
00:24:27,690 --> 00:24:29,250
It's none of your business.

475
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,690
Does it concern you?

476
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,930
I'm going to sleep for a bit.

477
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,490
Hurry up and eat.

478
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,010
Oh my gosh!

479
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,770
Chuxi, you're amazing.

480
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,050
Yeah, Chuxi.

481
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:42,490
Teach me

482
00:24:42,810 --> 00:24:44,490
how to get a girlfriend.

483
00:24:46,370 --> 00:24:48,010
What are you thinking about?

484
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,010
Last night,

485
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,890
I went out with Ms. Su

486
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,210
and got too drunk.

487
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,230
I was vomiting all night.

488
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:56,370
Does this count as compromising myself?

489
00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:00,290
I see.

490
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,370
Just eat.

491
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:04,290
This is absolutely yummy with steamed buns.

492
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:06,370
Don't dry your socks at my place anymore.

493
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,130
Go ahead, eat.

494
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,850
- Chuxi.
- Ms. Su.

495
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,790
I've got some good news for you.

496
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,610
What's up?

497
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:48,770
The contract with Hanhai Group

498
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:49,610
is signed.

499
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,690
Some project funds have been received.

500
00:25:51,690 --> 00:25:53,530
So, if all goes smoothly,

501
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:54,970
by the end of today,

502
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,410
the money will be paid to everyone.

503
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:57,650
That's awesome.

504
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,110
It's thanks to your contribution.

505
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,010
What did I contribute?

506
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,410
I just had some drinks.

507
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:03,170
Mainly because you're a good leader.

508
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,530
You're such a sweet talker.

509
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:06,570
Come on.

510
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:08,730
Cheers.

511
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,450
What?

512
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,050
I shouldn't say that. Bottoms up!

513
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:13,970
Bottoms up!

514
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:19,610
You finished it?

515
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,490
This is imported spirits. Savor it slowly.

516
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:27,010
Not finishing means bad drinking manners.

517
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,290
You always have great theories.

518
00:26:29,290 --> 00:26:30,730
This wine is too bitter.

519
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,890
It's not as good as our local spirits.

520
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,610
Go drink your local spirits.

521
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:35,810
Hurry up and leave.

522
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:40,490
Look at you!

523
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:43,330
It's your turn.

524
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:47,330
No?

525
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,700
I'm in.

526
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:57,610
Chuxi.

527
00:26:57,690 --> 00:26:58,570
Chuxi.

528
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,130
How's it going?

529
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,010
Salaries have been paid.

530
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:09,770
What?

531
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,410
Chuxi, say it again.

532
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,050
Salaries have been paid.

533
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:19,230
Wow!

534
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,780
I admire you very much.

535
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,010
Mr. Xu,

536
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,410
Zhao Chuxi arrived in Jia City not long ago.

537
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:46,530
We've discovered he has nothing special.

538
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:49,490
Are you kidding?

539
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:51,210
You should know

540
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,650
Xiluo is the head of Luoshen Group.

541
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:54,970
Do you think

542
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:57,530
she would keep someone like that around?

543
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,650
You're investigating the wrong direction.

544
00:27:59,650 --> 00:28:00,490
Reinvestigate.

545
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:01,850
Mr. Xu,

546
00:28:02,010 --> 00:28:03,570
I didn't believe it at first.

547
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,450
So I went to verify personally.

548
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,970
I saw it with my own eyes

549
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:11,250
Zhao Chuxi was working at the site.

550
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,290
Moreover,

551
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,450
he got very close to Ms. Su.

552
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:26,850
Alright, I understand.

553
00:28:26,850 --> 00:28:27,930
You go ahead.

554
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:29,530
Alright.

555
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:45,290
You really know how to use people.

556
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,530
It really makes me see you differently.

557
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:28,810
Xiluo.

558
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,370
Shaoqing, what brings you here?

559
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:35,610
The front desk told me you came to the site.

560
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:36,730
I can't believe it.

561
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:39,370
Why do you have to come all the way?

562
00:29:39,810 --> 00:29:41,290
Can't you send someone to watch?

563
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,610
You don't know.

564
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,210
There's a lot to wrap up here.

565
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,170
I have to stay here.

566
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:46,170
It's more convenient.

567
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:47,930
- Please have a seat.
- Okay.

568
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,410
I'll finish it right away.

569
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:58,810
By the way,

570
00:29:59,330 --> 00:30:00,490
where's your assistant?

571
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:02,850
Who?

572
00:30:03,090 --> 00:30:04,570
That heavyweight.

573
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,330
He?

574
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,330
He can't help much here.

575
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:10,370
He was given time off.

576
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,370
Seems you're aware he is not presentable.

577
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,410
What do you mean?

578
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:19,050
I mean,

579
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:22,410
everyone should find their own role.

580
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,170
Shaoqing, you know me.

581
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:32,130
I never consider background in hiring,

582
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,010
only abilities.

583
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,370
Drinking isn't really a skill.

584
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,170
Xiluo,

585
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:40,770
I understand,

586
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:43,810
as the head of the group,

587
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,130
you have to come

588
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,250
to such messy work sites.

589
00:30:49,290 --> 00:30:50,170
But it's best

590
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:52,330
to keep a distance with some people.

591
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,650
Lowering your status now

592
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,290
is not a smart move.

593
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,210
Yes.

594
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,050
Maybe you don't mind.

595
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,290
But remember,

596
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,450
three men make a tiger;

597
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:05,090
crowd's words melt gold.

598
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,330
If in the end

599
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,450
rumors and slander ran rampant,

600
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,810
it's still Luoshen Group that's affected.

601
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,090
Keeping this kind of person

602
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:17,730
on the construction site is the best choice.

603
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:18,570
Right?

604
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:21,890
You're taking it seriously.

605
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:22,730
Xiluo,

606
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:25,730
Luoshen Group has had issues lately.

607
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:29,690
Besides putting pressure on you,

608
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,340
your brother can't help you with anything.

609
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:35,130
I'm going to Sanjiang for business.

610
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:39,210
Let's visit your father together then

611
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:42,050
and discuss the company's partnership.

612
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:45,730
Just consider it accompanying you.

613
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:46,850
Is that okay?

614
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:53,490
Okay.

615
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:59,410
Anything else?

616
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,130
Come to the site less in the future.

617
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:05,810
Everything here doesn't match you.

618
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,370
Anything else?

619
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:14,370
No, you go ahead.

620
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,470
Alright, I continue my work.

621
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:48,970
Lu Yao, you're here.

622
00:32:49,330 --> 00:32:50,410
Why are you here?

623
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,770
I'm here to see you.

624
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,930
- Are you cold?
- Not cold.

625
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,770
Have you eaten?

626
00:32:54,770 --> 00:32:55,690
No.

627
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,370
Let me treat you to BBQ.

628
00:32:57,810 --> 00:32:58,650
I won't go.

629
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,690
Stop looking.

630
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:02,690
Ms. Su is not here.

631
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,850
Ms. Su went to Sanjiang with Xu Shaoqing.

632
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,410
Seems the situation in Sanjiang is urgent.

633
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,610
So why did you come to see me?

634
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:13,410
Take it. Your salary.

635
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:14,970
Salary?

636
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,650
Ms. Su might not be back for a while.

637
00:33:19,850 --> 00:33:21,930
So your job ends here.

638
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:25,490
Wait a moment.

639
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:26,890
I'll return

640
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:27,930
what she gave me.

641
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,010
No need.

642
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,490
You keep it.

643
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:34,090
Yeah, the clothes have been worn.

644
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:35,770
How about this?

645
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:37,930
I'll remove the SIM and give her the phone.

646
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:38,770
No need either.

647
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:40,090
You keep it.

648
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:42,570
In case Ms. Su needs you later.

649
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:44,770
That's true.

650
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:48,170
Ms. Su said if you don't go home
for New Year,

651
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,290
you can stay at the site to watch the gate.

652
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,530
100 yuan a day.

653
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,730
100 yuan a day?

654
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:56,250
But I have to go home to be with my grandma.

655
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,370
