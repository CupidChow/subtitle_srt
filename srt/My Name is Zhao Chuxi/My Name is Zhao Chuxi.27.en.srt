1
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,180
=My Name is Zhao Chuxi=

2
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,180
=Episode 27=

3
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,620
I didn't perform well.

4
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,460
Cheng Zixin, are you crazy?

5
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,380
This is my grandma's only house.

6
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:23,790
Erpang, is it necessary to be so petty?

7
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:25,950
It's just a kitchen.

8
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:31,380
I drank too much and barely slept.

9
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,640
That's why I didn't perform well.

10
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,030
You two stay hungry then.

11
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,230
Alright, Cheng Zixin.

12
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,430
You're almost to explode.

13
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,890
I'll make something for you to eat.

14
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,510
Let me check what you did to my kitchen.

15
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,790
Oh my!

16
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,900
Not bad! Your cooking's impressive.

17
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,390
Your proficiency

18
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:18,030
is one-tenth of mine.

19
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,940
One-tenth?

20
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,220
What you can do is to destroy the kitchen.

21
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,390
I just didn't perform well today.

22
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,780
Oh, come on. Stop overthinking it.

23
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:31,030
Otherwise, my whole house will be razed

24
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:32,500
to the ground.

25
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,460
Wait a second.

26
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,780
Let me calculate something.

27
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,510
I think I've figured it out.

28
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,780
The reason I messed up today

29
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,270
is that the timing was off.

30
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,550
What the hell!

31
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,430
Just let it all end.

32
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,460
Hurry up.

33
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,620
Looking at you is enough. I can't eat a bite.

34
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,310
I'm going to the bathroom.

35
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,740
Eat or not to eat, it's up to you.

36
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,990
We've decided to pull out
the investment in Luoshen Group.

37
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,550
Just like you thought,

38
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,500
Luoshen Group is now begging for leniency.

39
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,390
They don't even know who's behind this.

40
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:22,150
How naive they are!

41
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:24,150
Since I've decided to target Luoshen Group,

42
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,870
we wouldn't just prepare a simple gift.

43
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,390
This is merely the beginning.

44
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:32,220
Next, I'll have the media report

45
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:35,060
Luoshen Group's current crisis.

46
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,150
When the creditors come knocking,

47
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:41,060
we'll be sure to take down Luoshen Group.

48
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,270
Huang Tu.

49
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,150
Then, spread the word around.

50
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,310
At a critical time like this,

51
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,030
whoever helps Luoshen Group

52
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,180
will be going against Sanjiang Group,

53
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,460
and against me.

54
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,710
Understood.

55
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,780
I'm asking you a question.

56
00:03:57,460 --> 00:04:00,220
Aren't we at the final stage of cooperation?

57
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:04,940
I'm begging you to help me.

58
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,130
- I'm kneeling!
- No, no, no.

59
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,830
Don't.

60
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,220
This was the Board's decision.

61
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,060
The Board?

62
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,660
But Mr. Huang promised me personally.

63
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,860
You should ask me for help.

64
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,060
You should beg your sister.

65
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:15,940
My sister?

66
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,300
Do you know who's the boss of Sanjiang Group?

67
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:22,590
Of course, it's Mr. Zhao.

68
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,750
What's Mr. Zhao's full name?

69
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:24,590
Do you want to know?

70
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:26,750
Everyone in the country wants to know.

71
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,460
Let me tell you, his name is Zhao Chuxi.

72
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,230
- Hello?
- Xiluo.

73
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,750
There's something...

74
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,420
Just say it. I have a meeting soon.

75
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,470
The group...

76
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,630
The group is in trouble.

77
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,390
What kind of trouble?

78
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,070
Partners have halted all projects.

79
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,190
We can't hold on anymore.

80
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,070
The news hasn't gone public yet.

81
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:04,750
If it does, all investors will come knocking.

82
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,150
By then, Luoshen Group

83
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,150
will have to declare bankruptcy.

84
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,750
Wait a moment.

85
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:12,910
Su Qin,

86
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,950
things have escalated to this point

87
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:18,100
and become this serious,

88
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,540
why are you only telling me now?

89
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,630
So this is your competence, huh?

90
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,630
Xiluo, yelling at me won't help right now.

91
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,150
The priority's to solve the problem at hand.

92
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,590
If we fail to solve it,

93
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:29,270
it will trigger a chain reaction,

94
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,030
and the entire group will suffer.

95
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,350
Alright.

96
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,500
Does Dad know about this?

97
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,390
He doesn't.

98
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,190
His heart is weak. I dare not tell him.

99
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,190
You do know Dad's health isn't good, huh?

100
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,550
Fine.

101
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,270
Now I'm asking you

102
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,270
what the name of that group is.

103
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,150
Why did they halt the projects?

104
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,420
Sanjiang Group.

105
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,860
Sanjiang Group...

106
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:08,030
Xiluo!

107
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,110
Xiluo!

108
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,700
Xiluo,

109
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,510
I think you saw yesterday's press conference.

110
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,220
Aren't you close with Zhao Chuxi?

111
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,630
He's in Jia City right now.

112
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,100
Go ask for his help.

113
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,660
Given your current relationship,

114
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,150
he'll surely restart the partnership.

115
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,900
Xiluo, I'm begging you.

116
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,030
I'm really begging you.

117
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:24,870
Su Qin,

118
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,540
I'm telling you right now,

119
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:31,900
it's useless.

120
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,390
Whatever I say now is useless.

121
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,150
Even if I kneel and beg him, it is useless.

122
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,150
Do you know?

123
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:40,990
Xiluo,

124
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,750
calm down.

125
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,860
You'll find a way.

126
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,100
Xiluo, I know Mr. Zhao likes you.

127
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,860
He wouldn't destroy Luoshen Group.

128
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,700
He really likes you.

129
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,980
If you just go to him,

130
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:54,470
if you're willing to make sacrifices,

131
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,100
he'll definitely spare Luoshen Group.

132
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:58,470
Su Qin,

133
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,390
do you even hear yourself?

134
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,460
Let me ask you.

135
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,950
Just shut up.

136
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,540
He's in Jia City right now.

137
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,420
You just need to go...

138
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,100
Why?

139
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,390
Zhao Chuxi, why did I meet you?

140
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:43,790
Chuxi,

141
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,950
are you really planning

142
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,160
to attend Uncle Liu's birthday banquet?

143
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,100
Yeah, just to join the fun.

144
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,470
Right.

145
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,400
It's good to shake things up a bit.

146
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:54,660
But stay safe, okay?

147
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,350
Don't worry about safety. I've got this.

148
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,380
Chuxi.

149
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,380
Erpang, have a seat.

150
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,220
How's Uncle Liu's side doing?

151
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:08,190
Uncle Liu and Zhou Bin
went early this morning.

152
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,590
They set up dozens of tables.

153
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,860
All the prominent figures of Jia City

154
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,340
have all been invited today.

155
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,270
What about Xu Shaoqing?

156
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,510
I think Xu Shaoqing is almost there.

157
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,710
Su Xiluo is with him.

158
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:20,790
Perfect.

159
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,750
It saves me from meeting them one by one.

160
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,510
Today, I'll deal with all of them

161
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,900
in one go.

162
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,500
Chuxi,

163
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,640
do you think Zhou Bin and Xu Shaoqing

164
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,870
will fall for your scheme?

165
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,380
They probably will.

166
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:45,180
Even if Xu Shaoqing abandons Zhou Bin,

167
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,110
with his impulsive nature,

168
00:08:47,990 --> 00:08:49,870
he's bound to stir up trouble.

169
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:53,470
From the way you said that,

170
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,420
I sense something else in your tone.

171
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:11,820
- Ms. Su.
- What is it?

172
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,350
Just now, the local media in Sanjiang

173
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,230
simultaneously released news

174
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,700
that our group is going to go bankruptcy.

175
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,180
Once the news spreads,

176
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,630
the situation will be more precarious.

177
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:24,750
I've already sent people to handle it.

178
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,110
For now, you go

179
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,630
and calm everyone down.

180
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,580
Make sure no one in the company causes chaos.

181
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,990
- Understand?
- Got it, Ms. Su.

182
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,090
I'll handle it right away.

183
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,470
The partners, contractors, and suppliers,

184
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,270
we can still hold on for a while.

185
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,030
But we need to gather more funds.

186
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,300
At worst, we'll sell Jia City's projects

187
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,000
to support the Luoshen Group headquarters.

188
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,180
There's always a way out.

189
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,580
Su Xiluo, you must stay strong.

190
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,420
Xiluo.

191
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,070
Xiluo.

192
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:07,830
Xiluo,

193
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,990
why do you look so pale?

194
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:14,190
I'm a bit worried.

195
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,150
Something happened at the headquarters.

196
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,180
I've been thinking about how

197
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,900
to figure out a solution.

198
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,110
Oh, that reminds me.

199
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,180
I need your help with something.

200
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,150
I plan to sell the projects in Jia City.

201
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,630
Could you help me check

202
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:39,470
if any company is interested?

203
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,230
Sell them?

204
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,940
Xiluo, tell me what's going on first.

205
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,270
Let's see if there's another solution.

206
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,350
The Sanjiang project ran into problems.

207
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,300
The partner terminated the project.

208
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,300
Our funding chain is about to break.

209
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:02,470
If I don't sell the projects in Jia City

210
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,000
to fill the financial gap over there,

211
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,010
Luoshen Group

212
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,990
will soon have to declare bankruptcy.

213
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:10,990
It's that serious?

214
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,900
Someone's targeting Luoshen Group.

215
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:17,900
Who could it be?

216
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,150
Zhao Chuxi.

217
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,940
As expected.

218
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,470
In Jia City right now,

219
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,640
the only one with this much influence

220
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,700
and hostility toward Luoshen,

221
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,660
is none other than him.

222
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,630
Xiluo, no rush.

223
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,630
Don't worry about the funding chain.

224
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,750
My company can lend you the fund first.

225
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,420
If it comes to the worst,

226
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,630
we'll discuss selling the projects then.

227
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,390
Remember this,

228
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,180
I am your fiancé.

229
00:11:59,870 --> 00:12:01,030
As long as I'm here,

230
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,870
I won't stand by and let him bully you.

231
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,230
Thank you.

232
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:12,270
Isn't this what I should do?

233
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,020
Hello.

234
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,170
Mr. Zhou.

235
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,580
Why act smug over some lucky break?

236
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:46,660
(Grand Ballroom)
You'll fall hard sooner or later.

237
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:47,560
Just endure it.

238
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,300
Be grateful if he doesn't cause you trouble.

239
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,700
You'll get your chance to settle this.

240
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,630
I just can't stand his arrogance.

241
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,270
Mr. Zhou, nice to meet you.

242
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,110
Hello.

243
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,300
I need to tell you something.

244
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:00,520
You might not believe it.

245
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:02,510
Stop keeping me in suspense.

246
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:06,700
Zhao Chuxi returned a few days ago.

247
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,390
You're saying Zhao Chuxi is back?

248
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,570
Do Xu Shaoqing and Zhou Bin know?

249
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,820
Isn't he worried they'll cause trouble?

250
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,100
Didn't you watch the press conference?

251
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,060
You're not telling me

252
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,300
Zhao Chuxi is the famous chairman, huh?

253
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,430
Are you still half-asleep this morning?

254
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,030
I compared the photos.

255
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,070
They're definitely the same person.

256
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:29,420
The chairman of Sanjiang Group is Zhao Chuxi.

257
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,420
Good morning, Mr. Xu.

258
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,380
Mr. Xu.

259
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,260
Zhou.

260
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,270
Mr. Xu, long time no see.

261
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,470
Ms. Su is getting more and more stunning.

262
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:47,510
You're too kind, Mr. Zhou.

263
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,510
Uncle Liu sure went all out today.

264
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,030
It's his 66th birthday, a rare occasion.

265
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,350
We all need to act carefully.

266
00:14:00,030 --> 00:14:03,060
We can't afford to slip up now.

267
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,270
I understand exactly what you mean.

268
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,350
Back then, we treated him so badly.

269
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:11,030
And now he is so powerful.

270
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,110
If he won't seek revenge, I doubt it.

271
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:17,420
Let's hope he doesn't push us too far.

272
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,030
Otherwise, I have to take extreme measures.

273
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,580
Do you think he'll show up to stir things up?

274
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,270
I don't think he'd dare.

275
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,280
Alright, let's go.

276
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,550
I'll take you to meet Uncle Liu.

277
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,420
Alright.

278
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,470
Let's go.

279
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,260
Xiluo.

280
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,110
Come on, let's go meet Uncle Liu.

281
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:20,900
(Best wishes to Uncle Liu
for his 66th birthday)

282
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:23,230
Among those present

283
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,660
are Mr. Xu from Hanhai Group.

284
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,620
Mr. Xu

285
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:28,640
has truly honored us with your presence.

286
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,780
I hope you enjoy the food and drinks,

287
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,030
and have a great time.

288
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:15,470
Uncle Liu, I'm here

289
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,390
to wish you a long and healthy life.

290
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,060
You are

291
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,700
the successor of Jian Ying?

292
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:29,390
Uncle Liu, are you getting old?

293
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,060
Your memory seems to be failing.

294
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:33,820
Don't you remember me, Zhao Chuxi?

295
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,700
If you really don't recall,

296
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,900
you can ask Bin.

297
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,380
Sorry,

298
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:50,750
seems our paths seldom cross.

299
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,870
It's been years.

300
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,980
You've learned to pretend to be ignorant.

301
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,620
Pretending not to recognize me?

302
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,420
You've gone astray by imitating Mr. Xu, huh?

303
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,070
Mr. Xu.

304
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,270
You're pretending now too?

305
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:17,920
Acting like you don't know me?

306
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,950
You can ask your fiancée.

307
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,050
She and I are quite familiar.

308
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,230
All of you are pretending

309
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,880
not to know me, right?

310
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:36,590
Fine.

311
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,300
Now that I've been here,

312
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:42,540
I'll make you all recognize me today.

313
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:44,490
Zhao Chuxi, what are you planning?

314
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,820
Your brain's working now, huh?

315
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,620
Bin, you said you didn't know Zhao Chuxi,

316
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,270
but years ago in Jia City,

317
00:17:56,270 --> 00:17:57,430
he was following you around.

318
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,300
Even if others don't know him,

319
00:18:00,670 --> 00:18:01,750
you should know him.

320
00:18:02,270 --> 00:18:03,110
Li Jianye, you...!

321
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,470
I finally remember you.

322
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:19,540
Life truly shifts over a decade.

323
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:22,190
Right, Uncle Liu.

324
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,380
People aim for higher ground,

325
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,470
while water flows to lower places.

326
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,670
Young man,

327
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:31,260
I still want to ask you something.

328
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:34,990
On the occasion of my 66th birthday,

329
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,030
what kind of act

330
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,990
are you putting on today?

331
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,620
I'm just here to seek justice.

332
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,430
What justice?

333
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,190
Uncle Liu's word is justice.

334
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:01,580
Today, I just want to see

335
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:05,510
who dares to offend Sanjiang Group

336
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:11,780
and who dares to offend me, Zhao Chuxi.

337
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,180
Mr. Xu,

338
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,380
I truly apologize.

339
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,510
Sorry about this.

340
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,300
My family's pup is about to have puppies.

341
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,400
I have to leave for now.

342
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,610
Don't waste time. Go quickly.

343
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:34,870
Thank you.

344
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:35,830
Thanks, thank you.

345
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,030
Uncle Liu, I have something at home.
I'm leaving.

346
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:45,830
Zhao Chuxi,

347
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,230
as for the grudge between us,

348
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,030
you can do whatever you want after today.

349
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,480
I'll stick with you until the end.

350
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,340
But today is Uncle Liu's birthday.

351
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,670
If you want to show off here,

352
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,860
don't blame me for being rude.

353
00:20:01,990 --> 00:20:02,830
Rude? Really?

354
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,010
Do you even have the power for that?

355
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:07,550
You alone?

356
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,700
Or you?

357
00:20:12,230 --> 00:20:13,270
Or all of you?

358
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,100
Who do you think you are?

359
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,270
Do you even have a say here?

360
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,820
Zhao Chuxi, that's enough.

361
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:48,830
Enough?

362
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,670
Far from enough.

363
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:52,620
Not yet started.

364
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:55,380
This time I'm back

365
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,750
to thoroughly investigate

366
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,230
all the past matters.

367
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,950
Each and every one of you,

368
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,860
prepare to face judgment.

369
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:29,790
Zhao Chuxi,

370
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,750
you're quite impressive today.

371
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,470
Ms. Su, it's been a while.

372
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,140
How's it going?

373
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:41,300
Living comfortably these days?

374
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,220
Zhao Chuxi,

375
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,910
I, Su Xiluo, owe you an apology.

376
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:56,530
If there's an issue, take it out on me.

377
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,350
I admit

378
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,230
I was behind the Luoshen Group incident.

379
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,300
Since you chose to be with Xu Shaoqing,

380
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,470
you should've anticipated this day.

381
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,540
The Luoshen Group means so much to you.

382
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:20,190
I am

383
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:22,140
just an insignificant nobody,

384
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,950
ready to be betrayed by you anytime,

385
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,550
isn't that right?

386
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:27,230
And Xu Shaoqing is so wealthy and powerful.

387
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,070
Enough!

388
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,510
Say nothing more, Zhao Chuxi!

389
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:34,780
I don't want to hear it.

390
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,350
Alright, Xiluo,

391
00:22:36,350 --> 00:22:37,300
calm down, calm down.

392
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,460
Don't get upset.

393
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,900
Su Xiluo,

394
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,510
if you leave with me now,

395
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,230
I might consider sparing Luoshen Group.

396
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:05,300
Zhao Chuxi, you're playing dirty, huh?

397
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:07,310
Fine!

398
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:09,140
Xiluo, make a choice.

399
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:32,110
Ms. Su,

400
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,780
think it through.

401
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:46,070
Let's go.

402
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,510
I'm here!

403
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,540
Did you fight? Did you?

404
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,910
What happened? Come on.

405
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,060
Let go of me! Xu Shaoqing!

406
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,250
What are you doing? Let me go!

407
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:06,900
Xiluo.

408
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,420
Don't worry.

409
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:12,950
I'm here for you.

410
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:15,060
I won't let Zhao Chuxi bully you.

411
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,710
I told you before

412
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,880
that person is cunning and deceitful.

413
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,430
But you didn't believe me.

414
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:28,710
Everything he did was insincere.

415
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,620
He only wanted to scam you for money.

416
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,270
Do you really think he loves you?

417
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,230
Today, you're seeing his true colors.

418
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,030
It's okay.

419
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,300
At least you saw it today.

420
00:24:46,030 --> 00:24:46,870
Let's go.

421
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:53,820
Shaoqing, I'm sorry.

422
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,230
I'm really tired today.

423
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,340
I want to go back alone and rest.

424
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,470
You head home and rest early.

425
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:02,470
Alright, let me send you home.

426
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,620
I want to be alone for a while.

427
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,660
Alright then.

428
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:23,860
Head home early.

429
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,380
Get some rest.

430
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,530
Why do you look thinner?

431
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,380
Oh no, you shook me again!

432
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:01,060
Are you going to make a move or not?

433
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,670
Let's have another round.

434
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:05,910
I want to see if you've improved these years.

435
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,540
Forget it.

436
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,340
I don't fight. It's boring.

437
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,470
Why? Afraid of losing?

438
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,060
Me?

439
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:22,670
Have I ever won?

440
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,030
If you say that, I totally agree.

441
00:26:28,230 --> 00:26:30,820
But you're tall and charming.

442
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,430
Every step you take exudes confidence.

443
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,580
How did your girlfriend dump you?

444
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:35,990
Enough of that.

445
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,190
Mr. Zhou, you have a story, huh?

446
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,580
Come on, let's hear your story.

447
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:44,990
His story is quite simple.

448
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:48,430
After leaving the mountain,
he went to the gym.

449
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:50,580
There, he caught the eye of a graceful,

450
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,580
S-curve woman who found him charming.

451
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,620
She wanted to date him.

452
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:57,190
He was with that girl for two days.

453
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:00,190
He sincerely shared

454
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:02,620
his childhood stories with her.

455
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,140
But the moment she heard it,

456
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,030
oh my goodness,

457
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:06,190
he grew up in the mountain.

458
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,300
And she dumped him.

459
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,060
After the breakup, the girl found out,

460
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,230
the entire mountain belonged to his family.

461
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,820
The girl regretted it deeply.

462
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,270
Let me tell you, there's more.

463
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:17,140
After learning martial arts with Master,

464
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,380
he sparred with me for practice.

465
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,990
We fought 499 matches.

466
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,670
He lost all 499 matches.

467
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,820
When are we having one more match?

468
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:24,950
Let's make it an even number.

469
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:26,710
Yes, everything you said is right.

470
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:28,710
You're amazing. You're tough.

471
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:30,140
You're tough.

472
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,380
You're amazing.

473
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,950
Why is he suddenly upset?

474
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:38,300
Yeah, why?

475
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,820
- Go bring Li Jianye here.
- Got it.

476
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,910
You all can leave now.

477
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,340
Father, you called for me?

478
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,620
Take a seat.

479
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:23,880
Is there something wrong?

480
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,180
Jianye,

481
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,820
about Zhao Chuxi,

482
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,750
how much do you know about his situation?

483
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,510
Are you asking about the past or now?

484
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,860
The past.

485
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,230
Before Zhao Chuxi was with Zhou Bin,

486
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,580
he worked for Xu Shaoqing's current fiancée,

487
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,780
as her assistant and driver.

488
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,750
But their relationship seemed ambiguous.

489
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:47,190
Xu Shaoqing even fought over this
several times.

490
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,510
Later, Zhao Chuxi started working
with Zhou Bin.

491
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,430
As for some specific incidents,

492
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,630
you already know about them.

493
00:28:53,950 --> 00:28:57,510
But Xu Shaoqing still wants
to crush Zhao Chuxi.

494
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,580
He contacted Zhou Bin to handle him.

495
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:04,160
But that guy got lucky and managed to escape.

496
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,670
Because of this incident,

497
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,860
Zhou Bin grew closer to Xu Shaoqing.

498
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:12,670
So that's how it is.

499
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:17,780
Father, their target isn't us,

500
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,580
but Zhou Bin and Xu Shaoqing.

501
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:23,140
Zhao Chuxi is now the chairman
of Sanjiang Group.

502
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,710
That's Jian Ying's company.

503
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:27,060
He's making waves in Jia City right now.

504
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,100
For us,

505
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,030
offending an opponent like him seems unwise.

506
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,060
People can be replaced,

507
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:38,670
but if my years of hard work are lost,

508
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,090
it'll be impossible to rebuild.

509
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,180
Father,

510
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,190
are you suggesting...

511
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:51,470
You go meet Zhao Chuxi on my behalf

512
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,470
and find out what he really wants,

513
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,430
and then report to you.

514
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,750
Don't let anyone else know about this.

515
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,820
Father, I understand.

516
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,950
Wait for my news.

517
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,060
At a time like this,

518
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,540
you still find time for romance.

519
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,300
Shaoqing, oh, Shaoqing,

520
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,060
should I praise you or scold you?

521
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,950
What else can we do?

522
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,030
Beg Zhao Chuxi for mercy?

523
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,750
Will you go or should I?

524
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,190
That's not what I meant.

525
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:49,790
I want to say,

526
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:51,300
he has fought his way back to Jia City.

527
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,620
You're not even a little worried.

528
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:57,820
What does Uncle Liu think?

529
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:01,300
Uncle Liu said I should handle it myself.

530
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:05,300
Zhao Chuxi is not the same as before.

531
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,190
He's in a very unique position now.

532
00:31:07,670 --> 00:31:09,160
That's why Uncle Liu stayed neutral.

533
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,670
Staying neutral means letting it go.

534
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,910
Let it go? How can we just let it go?

535
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:17,990
What else can you do?

536
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,610
Strike first to gain the upper hand.

537
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:22,710
Take him life.

538
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:32,430
Won't we get caught up in this?

539
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:35,140
As long as he's alive, we're always at risk.

540
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,710
If he's gone,

541
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,990
yes, people might suspect us,

542
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:40,580
as long as we act clean and swift,

543
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,100
who can prove it was us?

544
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,870
Tell me more details.

545
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,950
I'll gather top foreign experts.

546
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:53,950
As long as the payment is sufficient,

547
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,190
it won't get us involved

548
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,570
no matter whether they win or lose.

549
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:58,580
Are they reliable?

550
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,180
Trust me on this.

551
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,230
I'm lucky I never crossed you back then.

552
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,190
Otherwise, I'd regret it deeply now.

553
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,190
Stop talking nonsense with me.

554
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,710
Just tell me the important stuff.

555
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,010
Right now, we are on opposite sides.

556
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:12,030
Opposite sides?

557
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,670
What makes you say that?

558
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,910
If you insist on saying that,

559
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,780
it's Zhou Bin and Xu Shaoqing,

560
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,750
not me.

561
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,230
Are you out of your mind?

562
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,750
Did you forget?

563
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,540
I just made a scene
at Uncle Liu's birthday banquet.

564
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,090
There must be a reason behind it.

565
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,190
Uncle Liu has lived through so much.

566
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:39,270
If it's just about ruining his banquet,

567
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,430
and embarrassing him, then he seeks revenge,

568
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:44,030
it's pure luck Uncle Liu made it this far.

569
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,750
But what if I told you

570
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,860
Uncle Liu sent me here,

571
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:49,610
would you believe that?

572
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,820
Uncle Liu sent you here?

573
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:53,710
Exactly.

574
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:55,950
He asked me to find out

575
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,580
what your real intentions are.

576
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:58,860
Or rather,

577
00:32:59,030 --> 00:33:01,270
what would it take for you to let this go?
