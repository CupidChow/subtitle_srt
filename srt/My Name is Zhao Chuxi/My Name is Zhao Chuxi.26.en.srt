00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,180
=My Name is Zhao Chuxi=

2
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,180
=Episode 26=

3
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:12,590
Look at that.

4
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,840
Who is that? So out of touch.

5
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,880
It's the 20th century now.

6
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,400
Carrying such a huge bouquet of roses.

7
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,920
Probably he's just flaunting wealth.

8
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,590
That gigantic bunch of roses looks so tacky.

9
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:24,230
Who chases girls like this?

10
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:25,340
What a fool.

11
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,790
Who are you calling a fool?

12
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:35,510
Zhao Chuxi!

13
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,260
I've missed you so much!

14
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,350
What's wrong with you?

15
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,150
What happened?

16
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,670
You're driving me crazy!

17
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,620
I thought some lunatic was waiting his girl.

18
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:51,710
Why is it you?

19
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,950
I brought you flowers with good intentions.

20
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:55,260
Why are you insulting me?

21
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,900
If you don't want it, I'll toss it.

22
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:57,740
Wait, wait, wait.

23
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,260
Who said I don't want it?

24
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:01,300
I do.

25
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,990
So annoying!

26
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,060
You left without telling me back then.

27
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,310
Now you're back and still didn't
say anything.

28
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,900
It's driving me crazy!

29
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:21,030
Today, I'll make you embarrassed.

30
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,430
Cheng Zixin.

31
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:28,860
What now?

32
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,900
You're still so eccentric.

33
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,900
If you keep this up,
you'll never get married.

34
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:37,900
What does my marriage have to do with you?

35
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,270
Who are you saying won't get married?!

36
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,830
Alright, whatever you say.

37
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,730
Where are you taking me for some good food?

38
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,670
Anywhere's fine.

39
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:50,460
Anywhere's fine?

40
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:55,940
Where are you taking me for some good food?

41
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,860
Anywhere's fine.

42
00:02:56,884 --> 00:02:57,606
Anywhere's fine?

43
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:58,740
Wait a second.

44
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,220
Flowers! Flowers!

45
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:04,220
Why not wait for me?

46
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,900
Zhao Chuxi,

47
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,830
next, I ask and you answer.

48
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,740
No lies, got it?

49
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,740
Got it.

50
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:15,150
First question.

51
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,660
When did you return to Jia City?

52
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:17,710
Last night.

53
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,460
- Who did you come back with?
- Quite a few.

54
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,780
Why did you come back last night

55
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,710
and see me so late?

56
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,430
- Am I not important?
- You are.

57
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,590
But I had something important to do first.

58
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,110
You think you're such a big deal now.

59
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,510
What could be so important for you?

60
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,270
Oh, right.

61
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,660
Why didn't Erpang come back with you?

62
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,780
He's already back.

63
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,180
But he's busy too.

64
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,550
That chubby guy has no conscience.

65
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,180
He didn't even come to see me.

66
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,180
He has plenty of serious stuff to handle now.

67
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,270
What serious stuff can that chubby guy have?

68
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,220
Erpang isn't the same chubby guy anymore.

69
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,490
He's looking sharp right now.

70
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,710
Oh right.

71
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,460
How long are you staying this time?

72
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,220
I might stay for a while.

73
00:03:56,430 --> 00:03:57,470
But it's still uncertain.

74
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,900
Zhao Chuxi,

75
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,940
are you back this time to...

76
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,990
The debts owed

77
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,710
must be repaid.

78
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:11,830
Some matters must come to a conclusion.

79
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,980
You're really good at acting now.

80
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:21,780
Alright, let me see your act.

81
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,390
Tonight,

82
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,100
we drink until we drop.

83
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:30,300
Tonight, I'll drink you under the table.

84
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,780
The fate sure loves playing jokes.

85
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:50,060
(Ganglong Oriental City)

86
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,380
Hello.

87
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,520
Who are you looking for?

88
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,950
I'm looking for Zhang Maodun.

89
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,980
Sorry, there is no one named Zhang Maodun.

90
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:57,180
What about Wang Dachui?

91
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,290
You mean our Captain Wang?

92
00:04:58,980 --> 00:04:59,860
Captain Wang?

93
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,420
- Is he your security captain now?
- Yes.

94
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,830
Could you call him for me?

95
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:05,460
Just tell him a friend is waiting outside.

96
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,950
Alright, please wait a moment.

97
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,980
I'll go call him for you.

98
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,420
Captain Wang.

99
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,510
Don't play tricks on me.

100
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,900
I don't have friends like that.

101
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,660
If I did, why would I still work here?

102
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,340
Why would I lie to you?

103
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,550
It's him.

104
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,500
Wang Dachui,

105
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,340
do you recognize me?

106
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:29,870
Zhao.

107
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:32,230
Zhao.

108
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:34,270
I've missed you so much.

109
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,570
I've already said that back then

110
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,640
you're no ordinary person.

111
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,150
You were destined for great things.

112
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,660
You look sharp now.

113
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,830
Your flattery skills are improving, huh?

114
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,340
This isn't flattery, bro.

115
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:47,300
I'm just speaking the truth.

116
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,230
By the way, bro,

117
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,100
where have you been all these years?

118
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,630
When did you return to Jia City?

119
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,220
I just got back two nights ago.

120
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:57,220
I might stay here for a while.

121
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:00,750
Why is it all new faces around here?

122
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,950
Where did Zhang Maodun go?

123
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,300
He quit not long after you disappeared.

124
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,500
He started doing small business with others.

125
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,660
It was fine at first.

126
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:10,660
Now I hear he's drowning in debt.

127
00:06:10,710 --> 00:06:12,270
His wife is filing for divorce.

128
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:14,340
That guy's married now.

129
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,830
Time really flies.

130
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,340
Do you have Zhang Maodun's number?

131
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,520
Leave it with me.

132
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,460
Yes, I do.

133
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,750
He's changed his phone number.

134
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,500
How about this?

135
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,390
Once I'm less busy,

136
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:36,660
I'll gather you guys together

137
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:37,950
to have a good reunion.

138
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,100
Till you're not so busy.

139
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,540
Alright, I'm leaving then.

140
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,700
See you, bro.

141
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:54,100
(Ganglong Oriental City)

142
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,440
Stop talking, or I'll deal with you.

143
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,310
Don't touch my wife.

144
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:21,340
Paying debts is only fair.

145
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,300
Do you understand?

146
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,980
Stop fighting! Stop it!

147
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:28,270
Men are talking. Stay out of it!

148
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,910
If you dare say more, I'll hit you again.

149
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,540
Ouch, ouch, ouch!

150
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,510
What are you doing? Who are you?

151
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,830
I despise men who hit women.

152
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:39,780
- What's your deal?
- I'm here for debts.

153
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,030
Do you need to beat them like this?

154
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,830
Who are you to meddle in this?

155
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,300
Say that again!

156
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,300
I can't help it. He owes us money...

157
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,520
Cut the crap. How much is it?

158
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,220
500,000 yuan.

159
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,180
Zhao.

160
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,780
Maodun, good for you.

161
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,100
You haven't forgotten me.

162
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:03,870
Let's do it this way.

163
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:07,070
I'll pay off the money he owes you.

164
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,460
You disappear from his life forever.

165
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:14,100
Or else, I'll hit you every time I see you.
Hear that?

166
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,710
Once he repays the money, we'll disappear.

167
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,900
Mr. Zhou, leave him a contact number.

168
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,810
Transfer the money to them this afternoon.

169
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,550
- Got it.
- Get lost.

170
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,750
The three of you, come out now.

171
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:27,270
Honey,

172
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,020
this is Zhao who used to take good care of me

173
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,780
whom I often mentioned to you before.

174
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,140
Hello, Zhao.

175
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,190
Hello.

176
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,380
Maodun,

177
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:36,300
get yourself ready. I'll wait outside.

178
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,610
Come out and we'll have a chat.

179
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,470
Alright, alright.

180
00:08:38,870 --> 00:08:39,940
We'll head inside first.

181
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,700
(Repay the money, or you are doomed)

182
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:49,830
Maodun,

183
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,580
why didn't you reach out to me?

184
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,470
I know a little bit

185
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,060
about that accident two years ago.

186
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,030
I thought you'd contact me after some time,

187
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,820
but you didn't contact me months later.

188
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,510
Then I quit working there.

189
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:08,470
Why did you suddenly decide to do business?

190
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:09,850
And ended up losing money?

191
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,350
I got scammed.

192
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,470
How much do you owe in total?

193
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:18,860
Besides the 500,000 yuan from earlier,

194
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:20,740
there's another 500,000 yuan.

195
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:23,940
Plus my parents' house and car,

196
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,300
which are mortgaged.

197
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,390
Tomorrow I'll settle all your debts for you

198
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,390
and redeem those two houses for you.

199
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:36,540
No, Zhao, I can't take your money.

200
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,630
I have hands and feet. I'll repay it slowly.

201
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,270
Worst case, I'll start over from scratch.

202
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:42,970
If five years isn't enough, then ten years.

203
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:43,920
I can't take your money.

204
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:44,810
Maodun,

205
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,270
do as I said.

206
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,470
Compared to the call you made back then,

207
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,470
this money means nothing.

208
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,300
I value loyalty and friendship

209
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,750
and repay kindness a hundredfold.

210
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,310
Zhao,

211
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:08,830
I...

212
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,990
Don't worry, bro.

213
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:20,820
With me here, everything will get better.

214
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,300
Being your brother

215
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,270
is truly a blessing.

216
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,230
As the hidden boss of Sanjiang Group,

217
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:43,940
I know everyone wants to be my friend.

218
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:48,940
But how many people are truly sincere?

219
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:51,270
Most of them are after something.

220
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,580
But these friends are different.

221
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,390
They helped me

222
00:10:56,390 --> 00:10:57,510
during my hardest times.

223
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:59,820
I'm getting better now,

224
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:03,230
and I should give them some rewards.

225
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,900
Loyal and righteous.

226
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:07,830
That's admirable.

227
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,870
You always have such deep wisdom.

228
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:14,420
So, where are we heading now?

229
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,150
To meet the person who saved my life.

230
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:32,900
Excuse me.

231
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,660
Could you show me the menu?

232
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,990
Excuse me. Where's your boss?

233
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:41,820
Our boss is over there.

234
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:00,540
Can you queue a song for me?

235
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,110
I'll sing it on stage later.

236
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,710
- Sure, no problem.
- Thank you.

237
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:10,310
Why are you laughing?

238
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,780
You're going to sing on stage?

239
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,290
What's wrong with that?

240
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,820
Go ahead.

241
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:16,870

From his voice, I can tell

288
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,150
there are so many stories in it.

289
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,660
Mr. Zhou, do you have any dreams?

290
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,230
My dream is quite simple.

291
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:04,940
Three meals a day, just tea and rice.

292
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,420
Most importantly, you all stay healthy.

293
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,540
Pretty good.

294
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:23,110
Qingxuan, it's been years.

295
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,350
The last time I left here,

296
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,470
I was just a naive young man.

297
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,540
Listen to what you said.

298
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,540
It's like you're not young anymore.

299
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,510
Come on, eat.

300
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,160
You won't be in trouble, huh?

301
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,040
They won't still mess with you, right?

302
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,780
Don't worry, Qingxuan. I can handle it.

303
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,470
By the way, Qingxuan,

304
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,300
why did you move here?

305
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,510
I broke up with Zhou Bin.

306
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,990
Is it because of me?

307
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:59,820
He and I were never on the same path,

308
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,980
so we broke up.

309
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,620
Chuxi,

310
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:07,990
be honest with me.

311
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:10,540
Did you come back to deal with Zhou Bin?

312
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,270
You need to be careful.

313
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,950
They're not the same as they used to be.

314
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,190
Uncle Liu doesn't handle much anymore.

315
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:19,240
All the company matters, big and small,

316
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:20,670
are now managed solely by him.

317
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,470
Besides,

318
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,580
he's very close to Zhang's Group.

319
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,950
Qingxuan, don't worry.

320
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,860
This time, I'll show you

321
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,190
what goes around comes around.

322
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:42,340
Xu,

323
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:45,710
what do you think of this plan I made?

324
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,470
Are you sure you want to stick to this plan?

325
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,620
What do you think?

326
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,710
Lure the snake out of its hole, sow mistrust.

327
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,910
Cut off their resources,
a chain of strategies.

328
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,990
This is the best plan I could come up with.

329
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,330
I thought about it for long.

330
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,060
The success rate is probably around

331
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,340
30 percent.

332
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:10,180
30 percent?

333
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,990
Do you think that's high or low?

334
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,030
It's quite high.

335
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,870
It's quite high?

336
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:20,060
Xu, didn't you say life is like gambling?

337
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:21,270
Let's take a chance.

338
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,750
We'll follow the plan.

339
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,570
Shallow waters attract trouble.

340
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:27,950
I just want to see when the tide recedes,

341
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,100
what these people look like.

342
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,270
Mr. Zhou,

343
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,230
this is where I used to work.

344
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,270
Let me take you in to experience it.

345
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,100
A worldly place. I'll just forget about it.

346
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,060
Be careful out there.

347
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:51,900
Got it.

348
00:18:57,230 --> 00:18:58,670
- Xin.
- Come on, one more drink.

349
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:07,790
Xin.

350
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,270
Zhao Chuxi, you're so full of yourself.

351
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,580
Do you know how long I've been waiting?

352
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,710
It's a waste of my efforts

353
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,490
to have called so many beauties here for you.

354
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,750
Didn't I come as soon as I finished my work?

355
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,820
Stop with the excuses.

356
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:30,100
Sit down. Today,

357
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,430
all these drinks were ordered by me.

358
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,230
Finish them all,

359
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:35,350
and I'll forgive you.

360
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,470
Come on, you always make me drink.

361
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:40,050
Yeah, I do love drinking.

362
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,140
So, will you drink or not?

363
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,230
Why did you pick this place?

364
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:45,780
Why so many questions?

365
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,810
Are you even a real man?

366
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:47,830
Want a drink or not?

367
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,550
- Sure, let's drink.
- Cheers.

368
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,620
- Come on, Xin.
- Let's toast.

369
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,860
Do you remember me?

370
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,470
We've met twice before.

371
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,470
Both times were here.

372
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:04,830
Susu,

373
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,470
are you falling for someone again?

374
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,620
Let me tell you something.

375
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,030
Zhao Chuxi

376
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,950
can't.

377
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,140
Zhao Chuxi can't.

378
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:21,230
He can't?

379
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,710
He can't do what?

380
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,140
It's fine.

381
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,270
Whether you can or not,

382
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,430
if I think you can, then you can.

383
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:33,870
I can.

384
00:20:34,030 --> 00:20:34,870
You can?

385
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,670
I'm heading to the restroom.

386
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,340
Take it slow. Stay safe.

387
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:46,100
Hey, your health isn't great.

388
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,990
Want me to get you some medicine?

389
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,780
Zhao Chuxi, you're so clueless.

390
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,380
Hey there, beauty.

391
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,950
Have we met somewhere before?

392
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,750
Who are you?

393
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,580
Back then, you and that loser...

394
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,230
Didn't we cross paths here?

395
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,950
Watch your words!

396
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,620
Who are you calling a loser?

397
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,300
Obviously, that useless Zhao Chuxi.

398
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,150
Who else could it be?

399
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,950
You chose him back in the day.

400
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,190
You'd have been better with me.

401
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:23,510
Look at me now.

402
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,910
Watch this. Come on.

403
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:26,780
Come here, come here!

404
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:29,950
Call me Mr. Qiao.

405
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,130
Mr. Qiao.

406
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,540
So, how's it, beauty?

407
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:33,950
Let me tell you something.

408
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:37,060
I'm the General Manager here now.

409
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:50,230
So, why don't you stay with me?

410
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:52,100
Come on, let me touch your face.

411
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,540
Watch your words!

412
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,670
How dare you hit me!

413
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:00,620
So what?

414
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,660
I...

415
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:05,030
Zhao Chuxi!

416
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:10,100
It's you again, Shortie.

417
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,140
Zhao Chuxi, I really adore you.

418
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,540
You really are Zhao Chuxi?

419
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:18,780
Who else could it be but Zhao Chuxi?

420
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,060
What's going on?

421
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,640
He just insulted you earlier.

422
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:25,430
Zhao Chuxi, you'd dare to return.

423
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:27,100
Well, it's fine.

424
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,100
I've been waiting to deal with you today.

425
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,780
A few years ago, you had people carry me out.

426
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:35,510
You used to be the General Manager here, huh?

427
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,580
Now, the tables have turned.

428
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:40,950
This place belongs to me now.

429
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,510
Watch me make you regret it today.

430
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,910
Oh, I forgot to tell you something.

431
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,190
I'm now Bin's trusted ally.

432
00:22:52,510 --> 00:22:53,550
Who are you talking about?

433
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,750
Zhou Bin.

434
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:57,870
Shortie,

435
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,030
seriously, stop jumping around.

436
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,810
I don't care whose trusted ally you are.

437
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,860
I don't even want to talk to you.

438
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,060
Alright, I give up.

439
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:11,030
Zhao Chuxi, still as stubborn as ever.

440
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:12,510
Alright, guys.

441
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,990
Throw him out.

442
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,860
Let me see who dares to throw him out.

443
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,270
Erpang!

444
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,910
Erpang, I've missed you so much.

445
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:25,230
Why did you lose so much weight? Let me see.

446
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,030
- Alright.
- Why are you pushing me?

447
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,030
Zhao Chuxi, let me tell you something.

448
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,060
It doesn't matter
how many people you call today.

449
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:36,100
I'm settling the score from back then.

450
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,990
Oh, you want revenge?

451
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:41,580
Who do you think you are?

452
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,130
Let me make this clear.

453
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,440
I'm the General Manager of this bar now.

454
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,220
Impressive!

455
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,540
Tell Zhou Bin

456
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,470
that I am back.

457
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,270
Erpang! Erpang!

458
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:13,990
How did you lose weight? Tell me about it.

459
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,340
Mr. Zhao, the Jia City branch staff
are all here.

460
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,620
We can head back now.

461
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,070
They're all waiting for the meeting.

462
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,420
Zhao Chuxi!

463
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,950
Retreat, retreat!

464
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,780
Retreat, retreat!

465
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,030
Let's go.

466
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:57,830
Mr. Xu,

467
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,380
Zhao Chuxi is back.

468
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,270
When did this happen?

469
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:04,910
Not sure about the exact time.

470
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,750
Probably in the last two days.

471
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:10,670
Did you find anything from the search?

472
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:11,940
No.

473
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:12,790
No?

474
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:16,190
Is this guy so mysterious now?

475
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:17,630
Can't even dig up anything on him.

476
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:20,510
You go

477
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,790
keep an eye on him.

478
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:42,770
Hello?

479
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,100
I've got some good news for you.

480
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,430
Zhao Chuxi is back in Jia City.

481
00:25:46,430 --> 00:25:47,270
What?

482
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,190
You already knew it, right?

483
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,270
I had no idea.

484
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,780
Well, now you do.

485
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,470
I'm telling you now.

486
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,950
We're getting married soon.

487
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:02,030
Don't let me catch you seeing him secretly.

488
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,380
Otherwise,

489
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,670
you know the consequences.

490
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:23,790
Zhou.

491
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:27,140
What's the matter? It's so late.

492
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,430
Zhao Chuxi is back.

493
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:31,830
Who?

494
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,350
Zhao Chuxi.

495
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,340
Zhao Chuxi...

496
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,190
Zhao Chuxi...

497
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,830
Jiang Tan,

498
00:26:45,230 --> 00:26:47,380
keep an eye on Zhao Chuxi's every move.

499
00:26:47,470 --> 00:26:48,710
- Understood.
- Go right away.

500
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:55,230
Zhao Chuxi...

501
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:10,270
Mr. Xu,

502
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,630
why do you think the Sanjiang Group

503
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,620
is reaching into Jia City?

504
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,230
I just heard

505
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,340
the former chairman died of illness.

506
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,470
The newcomer

507
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,270
was an unknown rookie,

508
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,190
but his methods were bold and skilled,

509
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,520
quickly climbing the ranks.

510
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:31,230
The former chairman was a woman

511
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,670
named Jian Ying.

512
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:34,350
I once had the chance to meet her briefly.

513
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,910
Her successor likely isn't easy to handle.

514
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,960
Let's observe the situation for now.

515
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,670
Anyway, one should have dreams.

516
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:46,300
What if they actually come true?

517
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,620
That reflection of yours

518
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,820
shows you're feeling pretty good right now.

519
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,380
Not really.

520
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,230
It took you so much to get here.

521
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:56,300
Feeling a bit proud is only natural.

522
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,580
(Press Conference
Sanjiang Group and its partners)

523
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:09,670
Respected leaders,

524
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,510
- Xu Lin actually joined Sanjiang.
- (ladies and gentlemen,)

525
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,030
welcome to the press conference

526
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,320
- They managed to recruit him.
- (of Sanjiang Group and its partners.)

527
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,220
- This new chairman is quite something.
- (Next,)

528
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,780
let's welcome the chairman of Sanjiang Group,

529
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,300
Mr. Zhao Chuxi.

530
00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:25,790
Who is the chairman of Sanjiang Group?

531
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,740
Zhao Chuxi?

532
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,580
No way! Zhao Chuxi became the chairman?

533
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,820
Zhao Chuxi is the chairman?

534
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:52,750
Let's give another round of warm applause

535
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,950
to welcome Mr. Zhao Chuxi.

536
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,380
Mr. Xu, let's see what he's up to first.

537
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,780
Welcome all the leaders, guests,

538
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,710
friends and media friends

539
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,910
who attended today's press conference

540
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:12,270
of Sanjiang Group.

541
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:16,580
A special thanks to our partners,

542
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,540
including Jiucang Group, Fenggu Group,

543
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,340
Zongheng Group, Xinyu Group,

544
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,380
Chenguang Group and Xiqi Group,

545
00:29:25,030 --> 00:29:27,100
and partners in the strategic partnership

546
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,510
with Sanjiang Group.

547
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:34,270
I believe everyone has heard

548
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,430
that our Sanjiang Group

549
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,670
will launch multiple projects in Jia City.

550
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,670
Next, we will actively develop

551
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,710
the cultural tourism industry in Jia City.

552
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:48,680
We hope to contribute

553
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:50,440
to improving Jia City's cultural sector.

554
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,750
Once again, thank all the friends

555
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,030
from various circles who came here today.

556
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,070
Thank you.

557
00:30:01,060 --> 00:30:03,380
Now I hereby announce

558
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:06,030
the strategic partnership agreements

559
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,990
between Jiucang, Fenggu, Zongheng,

560
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,990
Xinyu, Chenguang and Xiqi

561
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,950
and Sanjiang have officially taken effect.

562
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:33,100
(A gift from Zhao Chuxi)

563
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,990
So, you're the chairman of Sanjiang Group?

564
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,100
Let me see

565
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:50,860
what you're really capable of.

566
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:10,380
(A gift from Zhao Chuxi)

567
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:16,910
Zhao Chuxi,

568
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:17,960
(A gift from Zhao Chuxi)

569
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,060
looks like you're declaring war on me.

570
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,950
Zhao Chuxi!

571
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,300
(The highest virtue is like water)
Erpang, open the door.

572
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,230
Hurry up!

573
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,520
Who's there?

574
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,470
Open the door.

575
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,900
Zhao Chuxi!

576
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,580
Erpang!

577
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,510
Why did it take so long to open the door?

578
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,140
Lady, it's only seven in the morning.

579
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,710
So what?

580
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,340
Let me tell you, seven o'clock

581
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,100
is the best time of the day.

582
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,270
You should be up by now.

583
00:31:56,430 --> 00:31:57,860
Besides, I'm already up.

584
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:59,750
I am up. Why shouldn't you be?

585
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:00,790
Well,

586
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,660
you...

587
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:04,540
Why are you carrying this so early?

588
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:08,470
I specifically learned a few dishes.

589
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:10,910
Today, I'm showing off my cooking skills.

590
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,340
You woke me up at seven in the morning

591
00:32:14,710 --> 00:32:16,030
just to cook?!

592
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:19,430
Who has an appetite so early?

593
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,620
I can't eat a bite this early.

594
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:23,470
Cheng Zixin, you played on the ice

595
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,230
and drove a convertible in winter.

596
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,270
And now you're cooking at seven...

597
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,470
Stop, stop, stop.

598
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,950
Listen to me,

599
00:32:29,950 --> 00:32:32,620
I'm showing off my skills for you all.

600
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,990
Stop nitpicking and just wait, alright?

601
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,230
Let me help you.

602
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,400
No need.

603
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,990
Stop, stop.

604
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,750
Let me tell you something,

605
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,100
this is my secret recipe.

606
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,470
No one is allowed to sneak a peek.

607
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:47,470
Stand outside.

608
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,680
Erpang, wake up.

609
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:56,670
Cheng Zixin is wrecking our kitchen.

610
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:10,950
I didn't perform well.

611
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:13,060
Cheng Zixin, are you crazy?

612
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,990
This is my grandma's only house.

613
00:33:15,300 --> 00:33:17,620
Erpang, is it necessary to be so petty?

614
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,540
It's just a kitchen.
