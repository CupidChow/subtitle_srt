00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,180
=My Name is Zhao Chuxi=

2
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,180
=Episode 21=

3
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,050
Xiluo,

4
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,320
still working, huh?

5
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,050
Look what I brought you.

6
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,210
I tried making a new dish today,

7
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,490
braised pork ribs.

8
00:01:26,010 --> 00:01:30,440
I also made your favorite fried vegetables.

9
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,590
Come over and have a taste.

10
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,640
Not bad.

11
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,130
Come on!

12
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,080
What are you reading?

13
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,240
I've seen this investment analysis before.

14
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,520
I think,

15
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,960
as people's environmental awareness grows,

16
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,800
the solar energy investment has potential.

17
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,930
But I feel the specific risks

18
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:05,770
still need to be assessed.

19
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,810
Stop reading for now.

20
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,320
Xiluo,

21
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,250
I've wanted to talk with you properly.

22
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,640
But if you really don't want to talk,

23
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,970
that's okay, I won't blame you.

24
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,720
Then,

25
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,040
let me talk and you listen.

26
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,370
See if what I say makes sense.

27
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:57,970
Alright?

28
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:01,970
First,

29
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,880
I admit that regarding Zhao Chuxi,

30
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,920
I handled things a bit too harshly,

31
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:10,850
which made you hold a grudge.

32
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:13,970
I apologize.

33
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,040
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:18,760
But at the same time,

35
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,290
I also hope you can

36
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,130
try to see things from another perspective.

37
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,740
Think about it.

38
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,130
If someone showed up

39
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,200
and put your life at risk,

40
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,630
would you fight back to protect yourself,

41
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,200
or let them take your life away?

42
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,760
I believe

43
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,010
you'd definitely choose the former.

44
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,570
I would too.

45
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,880
Because to me,

46
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:55,320
you are as important as my life.

47
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,810
So all I'm doing is

48
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,640
trying my best to protect my own life.

49
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,410
Do you really think I was wrong?

50
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,480
Secondly, whether it was the mistakes

51
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,570
that I made before,

52
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,400
or Zhao Chuxi showing up later,

53
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,690
for us,

54
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,930
I feel like

55
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,200
it's just a setback,

56
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,640
another bump on the road.

57
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,400
Although it hurt us deeply,

58
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:35,730
don't forget,

59
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,320
people on a journey

60
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,170
won't stop walking

61
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:43,050
just because they tripped over a rock.

62
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,050
He'll only walk with more resolve

63
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,010
and go even further ahead.

64
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,760
Just like us.

65
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,010
After going through so much,

66
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,960
I've come to understand

67
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,490
how I should love you.

68
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,930
And I've also realized

69
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:07,050
the Xu Shaoqing beside Su Xiluo

70
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,320
should be a better version of Xu Shaoqing.

71
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,080
So I...

72
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,250
I sincerely ask you

73
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,320
to give me one more chance,

74
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,720
and give the key to the one

75
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,880
who wishes you happiness most.

76
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,440
Okay?

77
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:43,850
It's alright.

78
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,400
You don't have to answer me now.

79
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,240
Let's

80
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,480
have dinner first.

81
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,010
Let's go.

82
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,600
Zhang,

83
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,170
are you really leaving?

84
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,610
I've already resigned.

85
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,730
I just couldn't leave without seeing you,

86
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,930
so I came back to check on you.

87
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,520
We were doing so well together.

88
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,320
Why did you suddenly quit?

89
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:44,200
I can't stay a security guard forever.

90
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,050
I'm thinking of starting a business.

91
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,930
I've gotten married, you know.

92
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,760
I want my wife to have a better life.

93
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,440
That makes sense, but business is tough.

94
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,930
Can you do it?

95
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,570
What's so special about it?

96
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,050
You know,

97
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:00,810
people need dreams and goals.

98
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,250
Look at Zhao.

99
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,200
He used to be a construction worker.

100
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,930
But in no time at all,

101
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,320
he's Ms. Su's assistant.

102
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,170
Well,

103
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,490
have you noticed?

104
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,030
Ms. Su seems interested in him.

105
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,050
Even a fool can see it.

106
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,880
But this time, Zhao...

107
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,570
I think

108
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,570
being a security guard here is pretty good.

109
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,050
It's stable, no risks at all.

110
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:27,400
You live more carefree than me.

111
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,880
Oh, by the way, I spoke to the boss.

112
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,760
You'll be promoted to team leader.

113
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,060
And you'll get a 500 yuan raise.

114
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:36,010
Thanks for caring about me.

115
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,050
There's something I need to tell you.

116
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,130
If Zhao comes back, let me know

117
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:44,010
or just give him my home address.

118
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,490
Will Zhao even come back?

119
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,320
He definitely will. Don't worry.

120
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,760
Alright, I remember.

121
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:49,970
Okay, I'm off now.

122
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,410
Do your best.

123
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,600
Come back if you're free, bro.

124
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:55,570
I'm leaving.

125
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:11,490
Hello?

126
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,640
Xuan.

127
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,480
Zhou Bin.

128
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,960
I think we need to talk.

129
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,210
Talk about what?

130
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,050
I think

131
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,280
we should break up.

132
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,360
Break up?

133
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:26,570
Why?

134
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:29,810
There are some reasons

135
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,010
that you'd better not know.

136
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,210
- That's it.
- Wait a second.

137
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:38,010
At least, you give me an explanation.

138
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,970
I don't want everything you gave me.

139
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,640
I only keep the house

140
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,010
that I bought through hard work.

141
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,520
What do you mean?

142
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,330
I'm exhausted.

143
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,280
I still hope you'll take care of yourself.

144
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,210
Don't get stuck in a rut and be exploited.

145
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,990
Don't let yourself become a slave to money.

146
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:35,300
(Postal Savings Bank of China)

147
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,210
Hello, sit down please.

148
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,160
What can I do for you?

149
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,250
Hi, please withdraw 30,000 from this card.

150
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,850
Sure, please enter your password.

151
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,690
Alright.

152
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,490
Here you go, your 30,000 yuan.

153
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:47,970
Please keep it safe.

154
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:48,880
Alright, thank you.

155
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,610
Make sure to arrange it

156
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,680
on the third and fourth floors later.

157
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,370
And let them...

158
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,240
Zhao Chuxi is still working overtime.

159
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:05,490
Very dedicated.

160
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,040
His performance is impressive.

161
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,970
Auntie,

162
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,380
why doesn't he turn on the light?

163
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,760
He's probably trying to save electricity.

164
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
That's not right.

165
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:16,040
It's bad for his eyes.

166
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,320
I'll turn it on for him.

167
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:19,720
Don't bother him.

168
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,330
Let's go.

169
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,880
Dad.

170
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,240
Xiluo?

171
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:37,370
When did you get back?

172
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,400
Just a bit before you.

173
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,610
Well,

174
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,520
couldn't you let us know in advance?

175
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,880
Something urgent came up.

176
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,460
I came back to handle it. I had no time.

177
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,130
Where's Mom?

178
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,210
Your mom went to Bei City.

179
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,850
There's been some trouble in Sanjiang lately.

180
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,310
She went to catch up with friends

181
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:54,210
to see if there are any other options.

182
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,210
You haven't eaten yet, right?

183
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,050
Not yet.

184
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,370
Wait, I'll make something for you.

185
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,570
Sure.

186
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,410
It's been so long since I had your cooking.

187
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:02,850
Just wait.

188
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,360
Dad.

189
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:09,490
This stir-fried pork with peppers,

190
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,490
I can't find this taste anywhere else.

191
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,560
Try this.

192
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,560
Your favorite tomato and scrambled eggs.

193
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,280
This dish you make is the best.

194
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,780
You've loved it since you were little.

195
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,250
It's a must-have with rice.

196
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,090
Eat more.

197
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:24,970
Xiluo.

198
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,450
So, why did you come back this time?

199
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:35,850
Dad,

200
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,130
I do have something to discuss with you.

201
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:38,970
Go ahead.

202
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,040
I've been thinking

203
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,610
the Luoshen Group, Xu Shaoqing

204
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,800
the Zhang's Group backing him

205
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,400
are too deeply intertwined now.

206
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,250
I want to regain my voice.

207
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,560
Break away from Mr. Xu Shaoqing?

208
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,900
Yeah, rely entirely on myself.

209
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,600
Xiluo,

210
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,680
our company is at a critical juncture.

211
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:05,400
Neither Sanjiang nor Jia City is doing well.

212
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,960
Have you considered the risks involved

213
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,160
in taking such a step?

214
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,610
Dad, I have thought it through.

215
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,880
Here's how I see it.

216
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:17,400
It's unlikely to break away completely now.

217
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,520
Their influence in Jia City is far-reaching.

218
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,280
No one dares to go against them.

219
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,520
But from a long-term perspective,

220
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:26,880
continuing like this makes us more passive.

221
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:29,210
Eventually, we'll lose all control.

222
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,160
So, what I'm thinking is,

223
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,900
we must break before we can rebuild.

224
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:36,200
Only by dismantling this dependency

225
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,800
from the root can we truly have a chance,

226
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,250
even the slightest chance,

227
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,610
to carve out a path on our own.

228
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,330
I know relying on oneself isn't easy.

229
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:47,290
But,

230
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,330
I came back this time

231
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,970
because I want to refocus on Sanjiang.

232
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,500
I've been thinking, Dad,

233
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,250
you've worked here your whole life.

234
00:12:57,090 --> 00:12:58,920
We have a foundation and connections here.

235
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,210
I feel,

236
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,920
they won't target this place at present.

237
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,520
We have room to experiment.

238
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,400
Xiluo, I support you.

239
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,970
But why can't you just be with him?

240
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,680
After all, for you,

241
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:19,250
he could be a good match.

242
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,000
Dad,

243
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,210
does that mean he's suitable?

244
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,560
But between being suitable and liking,

245
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,010
I've been thinking lately

246
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,280
which one matters more.

247
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,970
For people of our generation,

248
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,120
I think being suitable is more important.

249
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:48,680
Because it brings stability to life.

250
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,400
But for young people like you,

251
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,730
that's up to you.

252
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,130
I... I haven't thought that far.

253
00:13:57,130 --> 00:14:00,090
I just want to keep it simple and easy,

254
00:14:00,090 --> 00:14:01,570
like when I was a child, carefree

255
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:03,210
and not having to weigh the pros and cons

256
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,130
or considering everything.

257
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:08,090
I feel so drained every single day now.

258
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,880
If you don't like it, just come back home.

259
00:14:13,610 --> 00:14:14,730
It's my fault too,

260
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,490
leaving you alone in Jia City.

261
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,920
Dad, that's not what I meant.

262
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,780
I can handle this.

263
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:23,920
It's just that recently, I've been wondering

264
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,400
if it is really that hard to break free.

265
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:30,250
Maybe

266
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,880
it's because we can't let go.

267
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,130
Hurry up and eat before it gets cold.

268
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,170
Eat.

269
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,400
(Time quietly passed by.)

270
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,130
(Zhao Chuxi has been in Sanjiang
for nearly three years.)

271
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,490
(During these three years,)

272
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,640
(Zhao Chuxi has been constantly learning.)

273
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,280
(In the soil of knowledge and career,)

274
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,090
(he worked hard to absorb nutrients.)

275
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,370
(He studied diligently)

276
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:09,920
(and remained tireless.)

277
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,850
(In his spare time, he attended night school)

278
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,970
(and studied company management.)

279
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:17,490
(Plus, since childhood,)

280
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,610
(his father had taught him
the art of business,)

281
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,280
(Zhao Chuxi grew rapidly in three years)

282
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,920
(and was promoted to department manager.)

283
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:30,160
(Three years passed and everything changed.)

284
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,130
(Everyone's life paths)

285
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:34,800
(underwent dramatic transformations.)

286
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,880
(Erpang started losing weight.)

287
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:40,090
(Xu Lin repaid his old debts)

288
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,250
(and began farming in the countryside.)

289
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,520
(The grave of my son Han Sanqiang)

290
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,410
(Sanqiang succumbed to illness
and passed away.)

291
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,490
(Li Qingyi has taught)

292
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,210
(one batch of students after another.)

293
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,520
I think the same as you do.

294
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,250
(Su Xiluo and Xu Shaoqing
finally got engaged.)

295
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,970
(However,)

296
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,490
(unnoticed by everyone,)

297
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:03,680
(fate silently wove an invisible thread)

298
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,040
(binding them tightly once again.)

299
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:13,180
♪I say I'll wade forward with every step♪

300
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,690
♪You say taking a step back clears the sky♪

301
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,600
Hello.

302
00:16:17,330 --> 00:16:18,450
Do you need these books?

303
00:16:18,450 --> 00:16:19,290
Yes.

304
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,430
Let me calculate for you.

305
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,720
Thank you, Ms. Li.

306
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:25,210
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

307
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:28,330
Has you all received your new books?

308
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,130
Yes, we have.

309
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,130
Are you happy?

310
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:34,370
Happy!

311
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,760
When you go home tonight,

312
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,730
you can cover your books with book wraps

313
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,680
and then write your names on them, okay?

314
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,160
Okay!

315
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,450
Alright, take a ten-minute break now.

316
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,010
Go quickly if you need the restroom.

317
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,170
Chuxi.

318
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,610
Ten-minute break.

319
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,090
Sis,

320
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,330
guess how much I got for my year-end bonus.

321
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:04,450
Wow, that's impressive. How much?

322
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,120
150,000! Impressive, huh?

323
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,530
Very impressive.

324
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,680
Qingyi.

325
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,090
Thank you

326
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,930
for guarding Phoenix Village for Dad and me.

327
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,210
Don't worry, I'll give it my best,

328
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:29,600
earn big money

329
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,040
and build a school and a wide road

330
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,830
for our village in the future,

331
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,010
so it's easier for them to get medical care

332
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:36,970
and go to the city.

333
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:40,010
Of course, I believe in you.

334
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:42,690
You've always kept your word.

335
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,120
Alright then, sis.

336
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,410
Everything's going well here.

337
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,890
You can rest assured.

338
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,010
You go ahead.

339
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,460
(Your account received 150,000.)

340
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,450
It's New Year, time to put up
window decorations.

341
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,600
The windows are covered in red now.

342
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:32,050
Come here.

343
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:39,520
Does it look right?

344
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:40,570
Move left a bit.

345
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:41,730
How about now?

346
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:42,570
That's good.

347
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,880
Perfect.

348
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,960
- Does it look good?
- Yes, it does.

349
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,960
Come here.

350
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,690
According to this channel's report,

351
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,340
Jian Ying, chairman of Sanjiang Group,

352
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,600
is battling cancer.

353
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,660
Once this news is reported,

354
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,760
(The enterprise may shift leadership)

355
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,730
the entire group has been thrown into panic.

356
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,360
But who will inherit Sanjiang Group

357
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,590
remains a mystery to this day.

358
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,290
Aunt Jian,

359
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,250
why haven't they arrived yet?

360
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,120
No rush, let's wait.

361
00:19:18,890 --> 00:19:20,490
Furong is greeting them at the door.

362
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,600
Please, come inside.

363
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:47,840
- Ms. Jian.
- Ms. Jian.

364
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,840
Ms. Jian.

365
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,680
Have a seat.

366
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:53,080
Chuxi,

367
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,730
you and Furong can grab a bite outside.

368
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,890
We have something to discuss.

369
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,760
Got it, Aunt Jian.

370
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,120
This red wine is from our own vineyard.

371
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,140
The taste is quite good.

372
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,360
Relax.

373
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,930
Feel free to speak your mind.

374
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,040
Say whatever you want.

375
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:40,450
We're all family here.

376
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,490
No need to hold back.

377
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,520
Treasure this final dinner together.

378
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,600
In the future, having dinner with me

379
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,690
will be impossible.

380
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:54,290
Could it be

381
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,690
the rumors outside are true?

382
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:58,360
It's true.

383
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:04,840
Ms. Jian,

384
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,560
is there really no way to treat this?

385
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,360
I think there's still hope.

386
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,080
There are some things

387
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:15,730
that neither you nor I can control.

388
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,250
I've done my best.

389
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,290
Ms. Jian,

390
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,040
I want to know,

391
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,760
if you fall,

392
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,650
who will take over the company?

393
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,080
Du Xinan and Wu Heping don't show up.

394
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,760
Are we going to let them run wild outside?

395
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,010
We don't talk about this today.

396
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,320
Let's just drink.

397
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,410
Well, Ms. Jian,

398
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,970
if you're not around,

399
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:04,360
no one will truly listen to anyone else.

400
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,250
The company will definitely fall into chaos.

401
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,730
The path ahead

402
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,120
is for you to measure and choose.

403
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,560
I don't know what's on your mind.

404
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,060
But you're very clear about it yourself.

405
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,270
Take care of yourselves.

406
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,360
He,

407
00:22:48,690 --> 00:22:50,380
watch out for your fatty liver condition.

408
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,890
Eat lighter meals.

409
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:53,770
Alright.

410
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,600
Thank you, Ms. Jian.

411
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,010
Tao,

412
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,970
stop messing around.

413
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,280
Find a good woman and settle down.

414
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:15,930
Everyone still has a long journey ahead.

415
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,930
I won't say much more.

416
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,890
Come on, let's drink.

417
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,460
(Call from Furong)

418
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,010
Hello?

419
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,760
Aunt Jian is fading fast...

420
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,120
Auntie.

421
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:31,770
Chuxi.

422
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,840
You don't look so well.

423
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,080
Come, have a seat.

424
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,970
The rumors you've heard

425
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:45,840
are all true.

426
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,760
I don't have many days left.

427
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,010
When I found you,

428
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,660
I only had a few years left.

429
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:54,890
I just want to set everything in order.

430
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,930
To get to where I am now,

431
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,210
one small move affects everything.

432
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:01,280
Keeping this company intact

433
00:25:01,650 --> 00:25:03,080
is already the best outcome.

434
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,200
Chuxi,

435
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:08,130
tell me about your impression

436
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,170
of me the first time you met me.

437
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,800
I'd like to hear it.

438
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:13,650
The first time...

439
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,970
When I first met you,

440
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,120
I thought you were quite cold.

441
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,170
But you had great poise.

442
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,840
Your aura is seriously strong.

443
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:26,800
Zhou Bin dare not act out in front of you.

444
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:30,280
Back then, I thought, this woman

445
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,170
is definitely not simple and impressive.

446
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,690
But later, as I spent time with you,

447
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,520
and got to know you better,

448
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,450
I felt you were actually approachable.

449
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,250
Yet you have this commanding presence.

450
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:47,040
So I wanted to test your limits

451
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,450
and see what would make you angry.

452
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:50,120
But after trying several times,

453
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,900
you saw through me every single time.

454
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,690
Honestly, I admire you for that.

455
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,970
If I can't even figure out your small tricks,

456
00:25:59,510 --> 00:26:01,170
how could I deal with these big players?

457
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,170
I'd have been kicked out of the game.

458
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,040
Absolutely true.

459
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,320
In front of you, I'm nobody,

460
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,760
like a monkey facing Buddha.

461
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,450
You're getting better at flattering people.

462
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,650
Chuxi, your journey ahead is long.

463
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,010
Remember this.

464
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,930
Be kind when connecting with people.

465
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,600
But never trust anyone or anything easily.

466
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,280
You should always have your own judgment.

467
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,520
To be able to think

468
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,560
of possible situations and surprises.

469
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:31,560
If faced with hardship,

470
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,370
you can endure by gritting your teeth.

471
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,010
However,

472
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,450
stepping back might open new horizons.

473
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,120
It could also be a viable solution.

474
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,690
It is like a chess game.

475
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,730
You must know both offense and defense.

476
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:46,800
Be measured and patient.

477
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,800
Your words are so wise.

478
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,490
But this feels

479
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,800
so distant from my reality.

480
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,360
Chuxi,

481
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,650
I can't help you much anymore.

482
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,800
Here's a letter.

483
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,320
Only when you truly take over Sanjiang Group,

484
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,410
can you open it.

485
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,420
(For Chuxi's eyes only)

486
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:19,330
Auntie.

487
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:22,160
You're here.

488
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:23,570
I'm here.

489
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:24,960
Take a seat.

490
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,280
Sis, why did you come here?

491
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:30,320
What's the meaning of this?

492
00:27:38,010 --> 00:27:38,850
Auntie,

493
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,210
how's your health?

494
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,360
It's my old illness.

495
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,960
I don't have much time left.

496
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,560
It's just happening a bit earlier.

497
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,660
Chuxi hasn't found solid footing yet.

498
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,040
What do you mean?

499
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,210
Calling you and Qingyi here this time

500
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,800
is to discuss the future plans.

501
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:05,730
Chuxi,

502
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:10,040
your father was my mentor.

503
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:20,570
Chuxi,

504
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,730
this is from Dad for you.

505
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:53,250
When Dad was on his deathbed,

506
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:56,010
he said Aunt Jian's shares should go to you.

507
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,760
I know you think Dad did this because...

508
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,410
Because our arrival

509
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,520
made you lose your family.

510
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,100
But I'm telling you, that's not true.

511
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,930
During the time I was gone,

512
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,340
you stayed with Dad every single day.

513
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,340
You kept him company and cared for him.

514
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,010
Until the day he passed away,

515
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,680
you still refused to leave Phoenix Village.

516
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:25,530
You said,

517
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,210
Dad gave his life to protect this place,

518
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,650
so you wanted to protect it too.

519
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,450
Even leaving Phoenix Village now is because

520
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,120
you want to earn money to make it better.

521
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,920
There's one thing I'm absolutely sure of.

522
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:42,080
No matter what decision Dad makes,

523
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,360
he has his reasons.

524
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:46,080
And I trust no one,

525
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,450
except you, Zhao Chuxi.

526
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,210
But Chuxi,

527
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,360
does this matter

528
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,760
make you feel pressured?

529
00:29:58,650 --> 00:30:00,970
Do you not want to take responsibility?

530
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,490
Are you afraid to step up?

531
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,250
Sis.

532
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:14,080
It's not that I feel pressured,

533
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,750
nor that I'm afraid of taking responsibility.

534
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,360
I just think,

535
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:21,930
what Dad left behind belongs to you too,

536
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:25,170
not just to me.

537
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:27,970
You silly boy!

538
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,010
Why are we dividing yours and mine?

539
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,640
But,

540
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,600
since you put it that way,

541
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,840
I understand now.

542
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:41,410
Then I'll take responsibility for this.

543
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,010
Don't worry about it.

544
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:47,450
Hearing that puts me at ease.

545
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,450
Now I can head back with peace of mind.

546
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,050
Alright.

547
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,160
Alright.

548
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:03,320
(Not long after,)

549
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:06,490
(Aunt Jian received a critically ill notice.)

550
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:09,560
(She passed away despite rescue efforts.)

551
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,650
(Sanjiang was thrown into turmoil.)

552
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,170
(Before her death, she made a decision)

553
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,560
(to appoint Zhao Chuxi as her successor,)

554
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:22,040
(causing an uproar in all of Sanjiang.)

555
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,530
Zhao Chuxi,

556
00:31:42,690 --> 00:31:44,490
you are Aunt Jian's chosen successor.

557
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,170
No one saw this coming.

558
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:48,280
Now the entire Sanjiang is discussing

559
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:49,690
who you really are,

560
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,320
speculating about your background

561
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,520
and why Aunt Jian left the company to you.

562
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,600
The company shareholders

563
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,080
are still remaining silent at present.

564
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,490
Perhaps they were surprised

565
00:32:00,490 --> 00:32:01,730
by Aunt Jian's move.

566
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:02,970
Zhao Chuxi,

567
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,600
you don't have much time left.

568
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,360
I understand.

569
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,960
Erpang,

570
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,800
Aunt Jian has passed away.

571
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,600
Now I'm in charge of Sanjiang Group.

572
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:25,250
This might be Aunt Jian's best decision.

573
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:29,650
Do you think this is good or bad?

574
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:34,250
Every opportunity carries risks and rewards.

575
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,040
It depends on which one you can seize.

576
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,080
Which one can I seize?

577
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,690
No matter how risky the opportunity is,

578
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:49,450
I have to seize it.

579
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,760
Because for me,

580
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,280
this is the only way to change my fate.

581
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:58,650
So, risky or not, I have to go for it.

582
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,120
Looks like you're ready.

583
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,690
Ready or not, I have to go for it.
