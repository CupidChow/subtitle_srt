1
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,180
=My Name is Zhao Chuxi=

2
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,140
=Episode 29=

3
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,980
Mr. Zhao, during this period,

4
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,420
I've found some people
disloyal to the group.

5
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,390
You've been working hard lately.

6
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,340
You still have to deal with Mr. Xu.

7
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:27,900
It's my duty.

8
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,900
Rumors and scandals are everywhere now.

9
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:36,030
(Sanjiang Group Jia City Branch)
Half-truths are the most dangerous.

10
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,620
It shows that within the group,

11
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,060
we're not completely solid yet.

12
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:43,030
I actually have a suggestion about this.

13
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,150
Go ahead.

14
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,030
Pretend to defect, gather intelligence

15
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,540
and deliver a decisive blow at the end.

16
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,150
That's indeed a good plan.

17
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:54,110
But who would be suitable for this task?

18
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,070
Come in.

19
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,710
Mr. Zhao,

20
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,980
Xu Shaoqing just came to see me.

21
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,840
He tried to bribe me with money

22
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,390
and asked me to help him with something.

23
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,860
And Chen Tao is also involved in this matter.

24
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,860
What do you think about it?

25
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:16,620
I think

26
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,740
our group has already caused such a stir.

27
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:22,630
And since Chen Tao is involved,

28
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:26,420
it shows our internal unity isn't strong.

29
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,710
So, I haven't rejected him for now.

30
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,790
I told him I'd think about it more.

31
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,990
Don't be fooled by his strong appearance.

32
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,420
He's got a clever side too.

33
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,330
But I think you might be missing something.

34
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:44,420
Since you told us about this,

35
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:46,140
he's definitely exposed now.

36
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,220
Given how smart he is,

37
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,340
he must have a backup plan.

38
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,110
What if he turns the tables on you?

39
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:54,420
Since they're trying to sow discord,

40
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,670
why don't we turn the scheme on them?

41
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,350
Huang Tu,

42
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:02,260
I totally trust you on this.

43
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:03,370
Don't worry about it.

44
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:04,630
I'll leave this matter to you.

45
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,230
What should I do then?

46
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,190
Just tell them you betrayed me

47
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:14,420
and then agree to all their conditions.

48
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,980
We'll act out a show for them too.

49
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:21,470
(Cannons; General)
This time Zhang Shengbai is truly done for.

50
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,860
(General)

51
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:38,260
So Huang Tu intentionally defected to us?

52
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,390
Mr. Zhang, this is my failure.

53
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,950
Life, you know,

54
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,390
is like a game of chess.

55
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,580
Black is black, and white is white.

56
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,910
No matter how you try to deceive,

57
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,980
the truth will eventually come out.

58
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,980
One move reveals innocence.

59
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,790
Until the ending,

60
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,630
who can say who wins or loses?

61
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,140
Zhao Chuxi!

62
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,580
Zhao Chuxi!

63
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,750
Mr. Zhang...

64
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,030
Mr. Zhang, are you okay?

65
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,950
Mr. Zhang.

66
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:29,500
(You have a story and I have wine)

67
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,900
Chen Tao,

68
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,790
do you know why you failed?

69
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,710
I'm not like some people.

70
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,350
I was born at the wrong time.

71
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,190
I don't have connections like Aunt Jian.

72
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,860
When you handle things,

73
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,060
you never focus on people.

74
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:03,650
It's always about gains.

75
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,910
Doing that is like gambling.

76
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:07,860
Can you win?

77
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,190
You can, sometimes,

78
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:10,350
but the odds are slim.

79
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:11,980
Just like this time.

80
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:13,980
You only cared about profits

81
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,380
and ended up crossing me.

82
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,100
But Aunt Jian once said,

83
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,860
everyone's actions

84
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,590
come from good intentions.

85
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:22,300
So this time,

86
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,420
I'll let you off the hook.

87
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:27,060
But next time,

88
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,670
if you do this again,

89
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,910
I won't show you any mercy.

90
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,670
Zhao Chuxi,

91
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,270
people pursue wealth and birds seek food.

92
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:42,500
Is it wrong for me to act for profit?

93
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:59,150
Chen Tao, are you hard of hearing?

94
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,030
I just said so much to you.

95
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,790
Didn't you hear any of it?

96
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:09,420
Do you never learn?

97
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,180
(Su Xiluo is calling)

98
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:59,060
(Su Xiluo is calling)

99
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,820
Speak.

100
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,740
Were you busy just now?

101
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,310
Yeah, something came up earlier.

102
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,150
How have you been these past two days?

103
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,110
Why didn't you tell me
about the big issue at home?

104
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,830
What difference would it make if you knew?

105
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,290
Would it change anything?

106
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,540
Could you actually help me?

107
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,780
Xu Shaoqing, you...

108
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,540
You've been drinking too much?

109
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:29,830
As your fiancée,

110
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,980
shouldn't I at least call to check on you?

111
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,710
Now you remember you're my fiancée?

112
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,710
Yes, you are my fiancée.

113
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,300
But have you fulfilled your role as one?

114
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:45,790
All this time,

115
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,350
you've never let me get close to you.

116
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:51,270
What kind of fiancée are you?

117
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,400
Turns out all you've been thinking

118
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,860
about this kind of thing, right?

119
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,630
Once we're married someday,

120
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:00,110
I'll inevitably belong to you anyway.

121
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,140
Forget it, I don't want to argue with you.

122
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,390
I called you today

123
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,740
just to check on you.

124
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,980
Check on me?

125
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,710
All this time,

126
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,910
when have you ever cared about me?

127
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,860
Wasn't it always me worrying about you?

128
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:21,590
All you care about is your Su Family,

129
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,980
your career,

130
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,420
and yourself.

131
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,110
Xu Shaoqing...

132
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:30,510
Fine,

133
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,470
I admit it.

134
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:33,910
For you,

135
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,150
I feel deeply ashamed.

136
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,780
I've been wrong about many things,

137
00:08:38,110 --> 00:08:39,350
but I made a promise to myself,

138
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,500
I will change.

139
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,310
Stop pretending.

140
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,540
After I deal with Zhao Chuxi,

141
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,830
I'll deal with you next.

142
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,270
(Su Xiluo is puzzled.)

143
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,710
(Why is everything she does wrong?)

144
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:15,470
(She just wants to take control of her fate.)

145
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:17,860
(But she keeps sinking deeper into trouble.)

146
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,070
(In the end, she still failed.)

147
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,020
(She knows,)

148
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,190
(to change the current situation,)

149
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:26,550
(she must confront Zhao Chuxi.)

150
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,140
(But she indeed betrayed him back then.)

151
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,180
(She realizes)

152
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,150
(focusing only on Luoshen Group is selfish.)

153
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:38,590
(But Luoshen Group is her everything.)

154
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,660
(Does she really have a choice?)

155
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,380
(She hates making choices.)

156
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:46,710
(Fate always plays cruel tricks.)

157
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,740
(She hopes)

158
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,260
(she won't make the wrong choice this time.)

159
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,620
Chuxi,

160
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,950
Mr. Bai from Zhang's Group,

161
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,260
is asking if you'd join him for dinner.

162
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,070
How many has it been this week?

163
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,950
13.

164
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,660
Seems Zhang's Group has long been crumbling.

165
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,540
Seems Zhang Shengbai

166
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:21,070
isn't as formidable as I thought.

167
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:27,150
Do you think these people

168
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,140
ever imagined they'd end up like this?

169
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,500
Decline him for me.

170
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,030
Alright.

171
00:10:41,330 --> 00:10:42,200
Hello?

172
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,550
Ms. Su,

173
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:34,070
what can I do for you? Say it.

174
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,430
Long time no see.

175
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,310
Time really flies.

176
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:54,230
In the blink of an eye, time has passed.

177
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,940
Honestly, I should've thought

178
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,620
you'd achieve what you have today.

179
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:02,580
I mean it.

180
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,470
Trying to play the sympathy card, huh?

181
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,070
I admit

182
00:12:11,150 --> 00:12:13,540
you were truly a great person to me.

183
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,140
If I hadn't followed you back then,

184
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:16,700
I would've still been doing hard labor

185
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,550
on construction sites these years.

186
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,470
However,

187
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,310
compared to what you gave,

188
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,430
the price I paid was far greater.

189
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,620
I know,

190
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:45,750
I'm not qualified to tell you anything

191
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,350
or to discuss any terms.

192
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,430
For the mistakes I've made,

193
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,980
I sincerely apologize to you.

194
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,470
I know,

195
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,740
you've suffered a lot over the years.

196
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,420
Whatever punishment you decide for me,

197
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,620
I won't argue.

198
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,580
But I have one request.

199
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,710
I beg you,

200
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,350
please,

201
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,980
spare my family.

202
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,260
And the Luoshen Group.

203
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,150
I'll take responsibility

204
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,500
for the mistakes I made myself.

205
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,660
Can I repay it on my own?

206
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:31,780
Su Xiluo, what can you use to bear this?

207
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,870
What do you have to repay everything?

208
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:37,710
You care so much about Luoshen Group, huh?

209
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,750
Then I'll destroy it with my own hands.

210
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:41,230
Let me see how you save it.

211
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,030
And also,

212
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,070
your fiancé,

213
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,830
Mr. Xu, a big name in Jia City,

214
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,900
even he can't protect himself now.

215
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,540
So, you came begging me, didn't you?

216
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:55,740
Zhao Chuxi.

217
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,380
If the Luoshen Group collapses,

218
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,260
my parents will be ruined too.

219
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:19,060
If they fall, it's like asking me to die.

220
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,140
Do you even realize that?

221
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:32,900
Sorry. I was wrong.

222
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,500
I'm begging you.

223
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,430
If you have any grudges, then come at me.

224
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,470
Don't hurt my family.

225
00:14:41,470 --> 00:14:43,180
And spare the Luoshen Group, alright?

226
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,070
Is begging you not enough?

227
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:55,020
Ms. Su, the first time I met you,

228
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:56,950
you were so composed and elegant.

229
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,860
But now, you're so vulnerable.

230
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:03,110
You're not the Ms. Su I imagined.

231
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:14,150
Tell me.

232
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,570
What do you want me to do?

233
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,430
I'm afraid you won't be able to do it.

234
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:29,980
Say it.

235
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:45,380
Leave Xu Shaoqing.

236
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,620
Mr. Xu,

237
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:04,780
Ms. Su

238
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,620
met Zhao Chuxi alone today.

239
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,620
Alright.

240
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,740
Guan Yue.

241
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:20,230
Don't learn from me.

242
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,770
This guy's rushing around nervously.

243
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:56,940
He's definitely up to no good.

244
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:57,870
Keep an eye on him.

245
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:59,190
Report to me if anything happens.

246
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,270
Mr. Xu.

247
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,670
Xiluo,

248
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,830
you met my sworn enemy behind my back?

249
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,550
Why would you do this to me?

250
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,830
I can't win your heart.

251
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,030
How will you repay what you owe me?

252
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,910
Xu Shaoqing...

253
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,900
Why are you doing this again?

254
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,830
Xiluo, I want you.

255
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,460
Xu Shaoqing!

256
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,140
Xu Shaoqing, you're a scoundrel!

257
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:54,270
Help!

258
00:17:56,190 --> 00:17:57,110
Xu Shaoqing!

259
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,590
Stop it!

260
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,310
I said stop!

261
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:02,830
I said stop!

262
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:07,830
Don't move.

263
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,180
You are at least someone with status.

264
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,110
Aren't you ashamed?

265
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,430
Do you even know what you're doing?

266
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:19,830
This is a crime.

267
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,020
Ms. Su,

268
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,190
are you okay?

269
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,110
I'm fine.

270
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,270
Should we call the police?

271
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:45,190
No need.

272
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,590
No, thank you.

273
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:51,380
You all head back now.

274
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,950
I need some time alone.

275
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:53,870
Thank you.

276
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:57,110
Call the duty room if anything happens.

277
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,510
- Thanks.
- Keep an eye on him.

278
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,430
Let's go.

279
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,440
Hello?

280
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,780
Zhao,

281
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,820
just as you expected,

282
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,860
Xu Shaoqing really came to see Ms. Su.

283
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,270
But don't worry.

284
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,990
With me here, Ms. Su is safe.

285
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:34,470
Alright, I understand.

286
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:36,040
Please take good care of Ms. Su for me.

287
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:37,390
Got it, bro.

288
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:11,020
(Dad)

289
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,380
(Dad)

290
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,700
Hello?

291
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,460
Dad.

292
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,700
Hello? Xiluo.

293
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,580
What's wrong, Xiluo?

294
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,590
Talk to me, honey.

295
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,390
It's nothing, Dad.

296
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,190
I just feel...

297
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,750
Feel I can't do anything to help.

298
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,300
I feel useless.

299
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,750
Why are you crying?

300
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,380
I'm not, Dad. I'm not crying.

301
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,990
Just caught a cold recently.

302
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,380
Still trying to be tough.

303
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:06,910
You're still the same as before.

304
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:09,660
No matter what happens, you never tell me.

305
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,430
Xiluo,

306
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,180
things have escalated to this point today.

307
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,830
I don't blame you.

308
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,900
Maybe this is just the fate of the Su Family.

309
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,590
Dad, you should rest early.

310
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,460
Mr. Xu,

311
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,940
honestly, our situation isn't very clear now.

312
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,790
You're deeply involved in Zhou Bin's case.

313
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,460
Also, your father asked me to tell you

314
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,540
that he wants you to go home and discuss...

315
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,220
Mr. Xu...

316
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:31,900
What should we do now?

317
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,980
What should we do?

318
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,020
What should we do?

319
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,980
What should we do?

320
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,900
(Su Xiluo is calling)

321
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,300
(Su Xiluo is calling)

322
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,340
Hello?

323
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,790
Have we ever been together?

324
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,260
As friends,

325
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:46,900
you're not worthy.

326
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:53,140
About Zhou Bin,

327
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,380
what exactly happened?

328
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:59,110
Zhou Bin once urged me to do this.

329
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,070
Xu Shaoqing,

330
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:08,990
you really disappoint me.

331
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,860
My affairs don't concern the Zhang Family.

332
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,380
I'll handle them myself.

333
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:17,470
You only ruin things, never fix them.

334
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,650
You can't get anything done,

335
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,860
just bragging aimlessly.

336
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,940
I didn't expect you to stay so naive.

337
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,590
Naive?

338
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,310
It's truly ridiculous.

339
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,990
I'm naive?

340
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:35,590
Then what about you?

341
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,110
Have you handled your matters yet?

342
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,990
You were completely defeated by Zhao Chuxi.

343
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,140
Don't think I don't know

344
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,350
Zhao Chuxi was targeting you.

345
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,460
I was just a tool, nothing more.

346
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,060
What's wrong?

347
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:04,870
Feeling unhappy?

348
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,750
Losing doesn't feel good, does it?

349
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:12,220
Well, now it's even worse.

350
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,750
Your company has collapsed too.

351
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,510
And no one is here to help you.

352
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,030
This is your payback.

353
00:26:21,030 --> 00:26:21,950
You!

354
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,700
You still love hitting me, don't you?

355
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,230
Then go ahead, hit me again

356
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,300
until you're satisfied.

357
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,270
- You!
- Come on.

358
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,590
Hit me.

359
00:26:33,750 --> 00:26:34,760
- You...
- Hit me.

360
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,660
Not hitting anymore?

361
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,350
Zhao Chuxi said something quite true.

362
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,420
Right is right.

363
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,150
Wrong is wrong.

364
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,510
It's clear you're wrong.

365
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,660
No matter how you hide it,

366
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,590
you're wrong

367
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,550
completely.

368
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,430
You jerk,

369
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,670
come back here!

370
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,190
You're such a troublemaker!

371
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:15,900
You... You...

372
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,980
(Ganglong Oriental City)

373
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,180
I've already made my decision.

374
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,920
I'm completely breaking up with Xu Shaoqing.

375
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,990
Do you regret it?

376
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,420
I made this choice myself.

377
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,590
I know exactly what I'm doing.

378
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,460
Zhao Chuxi,

379
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,830
we're facing different situations

380
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,990
and different choices.

381
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,180
Maybe we're just truly different.

382
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,630
Su Xiluo,

383
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,180
let me be honest with you.

384
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,860
I never intended to target Luoshen Group.

385
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,350
I did this to bring Xu Shaoqing out.

386
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,220
So there's no need to beg me.

387
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,380
In two or three days,

388
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:27,430
Sanjiang Group will resume cooperation

389
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:28,940
with Luoshen Group.

390
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,590
Believe it or not,

391
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:36,990
I'm still the same Zhao Chuxi as before.

392
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,980
Su Xiluo,

393
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,270
I have never changed.

394
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,020
Farewell.

395
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,550
You actually destroyed your own layout.

396
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:13,140
I'm willing to give up
past mistakes and choices.

397
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,300
What do you mean?

398
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,140
One move reveals innocence.

399
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,750
It's not over yet.

400
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,790
Who can say who wins or loses?

401
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:55,060
Mr. Zhang.

402
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:56,900
Zhao Chuxi.

403
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:00,110
Why are you suddenly calling me?

404
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,420
When I first met you,

405
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,110
you only reached my waist.

406
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,310
Just say what you need directly.

407
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,990
This time I'm calling,

408
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:14,940
there's something important

409
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:19,660
I'd like to ask for your help.

410
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,590
Asking for help?

411
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,860
But making a call is so insincere.

412
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,710
You shouldn't call me at all.

413
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,660
Besides,

414
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,510
I want to see for myself,

415
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,140
if you are still the same as before.

416
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,460
You're Qingyi, aren't you?

417
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,270
When you were very little,

418
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:04,940
I used to carry you in my arms.

419
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,900
Now,

420
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:11,310
do you hate me?

421
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,110
I have no reason to hate

422
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,070
an old man.

423
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:23,900
I know full well

424
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:29,070
what I've done to you.

425
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,900
I won't beg for your forgiveness now.

426
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:38,140
But Zhao Chuxi,

427
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:42,460
I implore you to spare Zhang's Group.

428
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,940
It's the work of my entire life.

429
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,660
Zhao Chuxi,

430
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,830
I'm begging you.

431
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:54,860
This is my final request.

432
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,270
Please save Zhang's Group.
