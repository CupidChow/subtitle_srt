1
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,180
=My Name is Zhao Chuxi=

2
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,180
=Episode 24=

3
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,430
You also work at the Sanjiang Group?

4
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,180
The chairman's secretary is Song Qingci.

5
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,790
The strategy investment manager is Xu Lin.

6
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,540
The General Manager is Furong.

7
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,670
The deputy GMs are Fan Li and Huang Tu.

8
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:20,380
Am I correct?

9
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,670
So what's your name

10
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,100
and your position?

11
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,260
My name is Zhao Chuxi.

12
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,430
I'm the chairman.

13
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,150
The chairman?

14
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,980
I'm so sorry, truly sorry!

15
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,520
- Chairman.
- Still complain?

16
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:38,460
No, I won't.

17
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,030
No complaints, Chairman.

18
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,510
After getting off, report to Xu Lin.

19
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,460
Alright, I'll go as soon as I get off.

20
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:46,380
First, go reflect in the restroom for 10 min.

21
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,550
Got it.

22
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,670
Sorry, sorry.

23
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,790
I apologize.

24
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,620
I kept delaying meeting you since last time.

25
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,870
It's okay.

26
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,980
Let's have a meal together soon.

27
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,020
Sure.

28
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,230
Shouldn't you check my ticket now?

29
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,780
Sir, please show me your ticket.

30
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,710
Where's the ticket?

31
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,060
Lost it again?

32
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,830
Always so careless.

33
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,230
See you later.

34
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,270
See you later.

35
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:50,740
(Zhao Chuxi has gone to many places
along this journey.)

36
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,340
(He also understood many things.)

37
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:56,110
(Just like Qin Ran said,)

38
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,620
(every obstacle must be overcame one by one.)

39
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:02,340
(Destiny must always remain in your hands.)

40
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:04,550
Zhao Chuxi,

41
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,990
do you know what responsibility means?

42
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,550
I believe, compared to personal feelings,

43
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:12,790
what's more important

44
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,660
is Sanjiang Group that Aunt Jian built

45
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,740
with nearly two decades.

46
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,430
Now that you're her appointed successor,

47
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,590
you should understand this:

48
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,780
without you, the group would be leaderless.

49
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,660
To those of us following your lead,

50
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,230
you're being incredibly irresponsible.

51
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,150
How will you answer to Aunt Jian?

52
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,230
I know

53
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,940
what you've been through.

54
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,550
I also understand clearly

55
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,460
what Phoenix Village means to you.

56
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,780
But Zhao Chuxi,

57
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,430
if you can't overcome this hurdle,

58
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,340
then don't even think about

59
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,460
leading Sanjiang Group out of its troubles.

60
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:57,300
Furong,

61
00:03:58,110 --> 00:03:59,500
I understand your point.

62
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:06,420
I know people out there are afraid of you.

63
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:09,270
But I can also sense

64
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,270
that you have a warm heart.

65
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,060
You don't need to flatter me.

66
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,660
Since you've come back,

67
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,660
it proves you've thought it through.

68
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,430
Keep your spirits up.

69
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,150
I believe in you.

70
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,300
Don't worry.

71
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,270
Welcome home.

72
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:31,460
Are you ready

73
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:33,460
for the challenges ahead?

74
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,030
I'm ready.

75
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,830
I won't let Aunt Jian down.

76
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:44,870
By the way,

77
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,340
I saw Qingyi packing her luggage.

78
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:50,660
She is quite upset

79
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,810
about the situation in Phoenix Village.

80
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,540
Sis, you're heading back?

81
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,860
I didn't disappoint Dad, did I?

82
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,660
Of course not.

83
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,670
That's good then.

84
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,750
Chuxi, I'm hungry.

85
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,630
Let's go. I'll take you to eat.

86
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,660
Wow, there are so many dishes.

87
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,420
Is this green beans?

88
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,260
Yes.

89
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,860
- Bean curd sticks?
- Yes.

90
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,830
I'll take this. Can we put it in plate?

91
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,260
- Sis.
- Sure, sure.

92
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,420
Listen to me.

93
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,070
You can eat this dish anywhere.

94
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,950
I'll get you some specialties.

95
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,130
Alright.

96
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,540
You order first and then I'll see

97
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,560
what else I want to add.

98
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,630
Madam, get me a black carp,

99
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,420
dried loach and shredded beef.

100
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,860
And some spicy cabbage.

101
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:48,900
That's a lot.

102
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,340
What's this one here?

103
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,750
This is wild scallion.

104
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,270
- Wild scallion?
- Yes.

105
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,340
- Is it tasty?
- Yeah. It's only in spring.

106
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,950
- Only in this season.
- Correct.

107
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:57,790
I'll take this too.

108
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,660
And the green beans I wanted.

109
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,030
- Put it in one plate?
- Sure.

110
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,030
Come on, Sis.

111
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,270
This wild scallion with cilantro roots.

112
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,460
- You never tried cilantro roots?
- Never.

113
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:11,340
- Specialty, hard to find elsewhere.
- Alright.

114
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,750
Put both together.

115
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,830
As you wish.

116
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,270
And the main dishes.

117
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,100
A bowl of noodles with sauce.

118
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,300
And a bowel of cold noodles.

119
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,340
Noodles with sauce and cold noodles.

120
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,980
Try both of them.

121
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,820
Alright.

122
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,740
Come on.

123
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:28,220
- Drink it up.
- Drink it up.

124
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,630
Alright, the food is ready.

125
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,860
That was fast!

126
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,700
Come on.

127
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,030
Try my homemade shredded beef.

128
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,230
Okay.

129
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,860
We ordered so much.

130
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,950
This place is known for its local flavors.

131
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,370
It' has been open for over 20 years.

132
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,340
The food is amazing!

133
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:46,660
Just enjoy it.

134
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,030
You always go quiet when you eat.

135
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,230
Try this first.

136
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:51,140
- Garlic.
- Garlic.

137
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,900
- How is it?
- Sweet and spicy, I love it.

138
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,300
Taste this noodles.

139
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,180
Here.

140
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,190
Eat it with some spicy cabbage.

141
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,340
And have a bite of shredded beef.

142
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,980
It's so delicious.

143
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,070
(They don't need much conversation)

144
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,860
(and understand each other deeply.)

145
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,030
(Li Qingyi knows)

146
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,660
(Chuxi has grown through this pain.)

147
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,860
(Zhao Chuxi also knows)

148
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,390
(Li Qingyi, no matter when,)

149
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,420
(will always be by his side)

150
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:30,100
(and support him without hesitation.)

151
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,590
Well,

152
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,630
you're heading back soon.

153
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:38,300
I'll work hard here.

154
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:44,780
We can go back to the mountains for a drink.

155
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,750
Promise me one thing.

156
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,340
Don't push yourself too hard.

157
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:52,340
No matter what happens,

158
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,860
we'll face it together.

159
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:56,500
Yeah.

160
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,980
- Drink it up.
- Drink it up.

161
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,550
Erpang.

162
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,070
You haven't contacted me for so long.

163
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,630
I almost thought you were gone.

164
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,270
I was planning to tell Mrs. Lin

165
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,710
when I burn incense for her,

166
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,340
so she won't worry about you.

167
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,190
What nonsense are you saying now?

168
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,900
Granny said I'm a lucky charm.

169
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,640
She said I'd achieve great things someday.

170
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,190
I'm far from meeting my end.

171
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,270
She even came to me in a dream recently.

172
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:26,710
She told me to look after you more.

173
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,100
I'm doing great over here now.

174
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,300
I don't need that.

175
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,430
Alright.

176
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,850
As long as you're fine.

177
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:34,470
What could possibly happen to me?

178
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,880
You disappeared for a while before.

179
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,780
I kept calling, but you never answered.

180
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:44,700
Li Qingyi told me you needed some alone time.

181
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,150
I know everything about Phoenix Village.

182
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:49,940
Those things are all in the past.

183
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:53,900
I'm sorry.

184
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:57,820
I wasn't by your side
during your tough times.

185
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,820
I understand everything you're saying.

186
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,470
Erpang, stop talking about me.

187
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:06,390
Tell me how you've been lately.

188
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,940
I'm doing well.

189
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,630
I've returned to the Lin Family.

190
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,940
Everything is moving step by step.

191
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,540
My uncle Lin Zhenbei gave me enough assets,

192
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,910
so I could try my hand at things.

193
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,540
Whether I can make it or not

194
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,510
depends entirely on my abilities.

195
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,350
Chuxi,

196
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,780
rest assured.

197
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,110
Whenever you need help,

198
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,940
I'll definitely be there for you.

199
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:32,870
Got it.

200
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,720
Alright, let's leave it at that.

201
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,780
Chuxi,

202
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,580
you may have gradually
taken charge of Sanjiang Group.

203
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:58,330
Hope you can stay true
to your original intentions

204
00:09:58,330 --> 00:09:59,870
and make the group even better.

205
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,230
There's one more matter
I need your help with.

206
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,900
Considering He Yuanshan and others
are veteran members,

207
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:09,040
(Aunt: Jian Ying)
give them two chances.

208
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,060
If they refuse to repent,

209
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,230
then handle them as you see fit.

210
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,230
Debts owed

211
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,820
will eventually have to be repaid.

212
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:21,500
Let's go, Mr. Zhou.

213
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:23,210
We'll visit Mr. Du at the hospital.

214
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:37,970
(Unexpectedly,)

215
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,140
(when Zhao Chuxi arrived at the hospital,)

216
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,590
(Du Xinan had already passed away.)

217
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,680
(This dealt a heavy blow to Zhao Chuxi.)

218
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,720
(But it also solidified Zhao Chuxi's resolve)

219
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,810
(to bring them to justice.)

220
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:01,620
(Sanjiang Group)

221
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:10,540
I never thought Mr. Du wouldn't pull through.

222
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,180
How's the driver doing?

223
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,780
He's gone too.

224
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,780
Was the car thoroughly checked?

225
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,620
Yes, it was.

226
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:20,070
No issues were found at all.

227
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:23,710
Let's go.

228
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,390
Come with me to send Mr. Du off.

229
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:31,980
(My kind father, Du Xinan)

230
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,900
He Yuanshan.

231
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,410
A hypocrite's shedding crocodile tears.

232
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,750
How dare he show up here!

233
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,660
Stop right there.

234
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,360
What gives you the right to be here?

235
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,310
Zhao Chuxi,

236
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,540
am I not supposed to be here?

237
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,870
Whether you should or shouldn't, you're here.

238
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,720
I've known Du for so many years.

239
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:25,540
I must be here to send him off.

240
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:27,990
Of course.

241
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,870
Given what's happened,

242
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,820
it's truly unfortunate for all of us.

243
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:35,510
But this serves as a reminder for everyone.

244
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,060
Life is full of unexpected changes.

245
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,180
Fortunes can shift in an instant.

246
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:45,180
Sometimes, we must know when to stop.

247
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:50,780
Or what's lost is lost.

248
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,630
You're absolutely right.

249
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,300
One should not be too selfish

250
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,580
and should know when to stop.

251
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,580
Otherwise, the new overthrow the old.

252
00:13:04,390 --> 00:13:06,820
What should the old do?

253
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:12,060
Retreating wisely is the smartest move.

254
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,030
Retreating wisely?

255
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,510
Didn't Du retreat wisely?

256
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:19,120
But what happened in the end?

257
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,780
Today is Du's funeral.

258
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,580
I don't want to argue with you.

259
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,700
But if you keep pushing your luck,

260
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:35,630
do you believe I can deal with you right now?

261
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,510
I truly don't believe you.

262
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:05,230
He,

263
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,870
look.

264
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,820
Heaven spares no one.

265
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:13,710
Remember this.

266
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,870
Ms. Fang,

267
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:22,780
I'm sorry.

268
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,750
I acted impulsively just now.

269
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,070
It's okay.

270
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,230
Mr. Du is gone.

271
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:32,180
From now on, I am your family.

272
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,030
If you need anything, then come to me.

273
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,990
I'll do my best.

274
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:38,900
We can't bring back the dead.

275
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,060
I believe, wherever Mr. Du is,

276
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,540
he hopes for your health

277
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,820
and happiness.

278
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,350
Take good care of yourself.

279
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,420
You mustn't fall.

280
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:51,870
Zhao Chuxi,

281
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:58,580
do you want to know who hurt Mr. Du?

282
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,940
What do you mean?

283
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,030
It's definitely not me.

284
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,510
I knew it.

285
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:08,420
You can sell out everything for profit.

286
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,150
Oriole in the post.

287
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,150
How could they harm Mr. Du?

288
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:28,510
The matter of Du Xinan

289
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,350
represents a complete breakdown

290
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,740
between He Yuanshan and Zhao Chuxi.

291
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,110
This is a warning to us.

292
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,420
Zhao Chuxi is at his most difficult time now.

293
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,750
It's also time for us to make a choice.

294
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,390
What if I choose Zhao Chuxi?

295
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:53,420
At worst, you'll end up like Du Xinan.

296
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,110
But here's what I want to say.

297
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,900
These people will do anything for profit.

298
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:01,270
Even if they win,

299
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,990
you won't get what you deserve.

300
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,060
Eventually, they'll get rid of you too.

301
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,180
If we side with Zhao Chuxi

302
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,110
at this moment,

303
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,900
it'll be a lifeline for him.

304
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,780
Even though we don't ask for anything,

305
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:21,940
Zhao Chuxi would still offer the best terms

306
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,970
to solidify our support.

307
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:28,060
But will Zhao Chuxi betray me afterward?

308
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:31,030
- He won't.
- Why not?

309
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,580
Because that's exactly the reason

310
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:34,230
why Ms. Jian chose him.

311
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:38,940
Alright,

312
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,660
I'll take the gamble.

313
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,180
They all say I am timid,

314
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,300
but this time I'll go big.

315
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,660
I choose Zhao Chuxi.

316
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,190
However,

317
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,960
I still need to evaluate him further.

318
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,700
I'll go meet him myself.

319
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,990
Zhao Chuxi, let me ask you something.

320
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,810
Several companies are independent.

321
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,940
How long can the group's cash hold out?

322
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,510
We can't even pay salaries this month, right?

323
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,100
And Du Xinan's death.

324
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,380
Up until today,

325
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,190
you haven't given anyone an explanation.

326
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:20,590
Yes,

327
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,230
I'm fully aware of all these issues.

328
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:24,060
Then why haven't you avenged him?

329
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:26,380
If it weren't for supporting you,
would he have died?

330
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:28,340
Do you think I want him to die for nothing?

331
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,990
Anyone can say something nice.

332
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:34,190
If you don't trust me,

333
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,720
do you dare to make a bet with me?

334
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:36,800
What kind of bet?

335
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,230
I don't need your support.

336
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:39,990
Just stay neutral, that's all.

337
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,190
Within six months,

338
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,980
if I can't avenge Mr. Du

339
00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:44,620
or solve the company's financial issues,

340
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,710
I'll leave Sanjiang Group for good.

341
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,620
Are you calling this a wager contract?

342
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,100
I just ask you if you dare.

343
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,300
What is there to be afraid of?

344
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,620
I'll give you six months.

345
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,540
Let's see how you handle the trouble.

346
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,710
Just don't regret it later.

347
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,860
A promise is unbreakable.

348
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:02,780
Deal.

349
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:16,460
Chuxi.

350
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,080
You were looking for me?

351
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,940
Have a seat.

352
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,700
What's the matter?

353
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,180
Xu,

354
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,140
I want to ask you

355
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:28,540
if there's a way

356
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,620
to solve cash flow quickly.

357
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,670
We don't have to limit ourselves to Sanjiang.

358
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,030
We can also consider nearby cities.

359
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:41,100
Hai City and Bei City are good options.

360
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,100
We could bring in strategic investors

361
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,810
to solve the company's recent funding issue

362
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,670
through proper financing methods.

363
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,620
Xu, time is tight and the task is heavy.

364
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,860
How confident are you?

365
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,540
Just wait for the news.

366
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,590
- I'm leaving.
- Xu.

367
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,740
Looking forward to your good news.

368
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:02,500
Actually, none of this is a big deal.

369
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,670
The real issue right now is you.

370
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:06,030
What's wrong?

371
00:19:07,910 --> 00:19:08,750
Chuxi,

372
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:12,030
you are the backbone of Sanjiang.

373
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,710
You can't fall.

374
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,070
Don't worry.

375
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,230
I can handle it.

376
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,910
That's exactly what I wanted to hear.

377
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,620
So, what plans do you have?

378
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,820
I need to find out the cause

379
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,230
of Mr. Du's death clearly.

380
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,230
The accident report revealed

381
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:36,140
the accident was caused by brake failure.

382
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,470
But as far as I know,

383
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:41,140
this car passed its annual inspection
a month ago.

384
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:43,860
How could the brakes fail so quickly?

385
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,100
But now the vehicle is already scrapped,

386
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,810
and there's no way to investigate further.

387
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,270
However, what's intriguing is,

388
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,270
the driver, Mr. Wang,

389
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,380
received a large transfer just days before.

390
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,300
Before he died, the money went to his wife.

391
00:19:58,670 --> 00:20:00,510
Although I can't confirm yet,

392
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:04,230
I believe the highest possibility

393
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,460
is him,

394
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,710
Wu Heping.

395
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,340
(Wang; Driver; Du Xinan)

396
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,580
(Rival; He Yuanshan; Ally)

397
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,700
(Wu Heping)

398
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:35,910
Take the money and leave quickly!

399
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,060
I don't want to see you anymore.

400
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,660
Alright.

401
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,430
Wu, surprised?

402
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,220
Zhao Chuxi,

403
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,430
what are you doing here?

404
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,860
I want to talk about Mr. Du with you.

405
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,670
What do you mean?

406
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,670
I don't understand.

407
00:20:56,670 --> 00:20:57,860
What don't you understand?

408
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,270
You think I don't know her, right?

409
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,380
Mrs. Wang,

410
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,380
aren't you the wife of Wang, Mr. Du's driver?

411
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,300
I also know

412
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,910
you are battling cancer

413
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:10,670
and you are desperately in need of money.

414
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:14,140
So he asked Wang to help him with something

415
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,990
and promised five million after it's done.

416
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:16,980
Isn't that right?

417
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,620
You're so reckless, seriously.

418
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,030
Do you know Mr. Du was aware of this

419
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:24,710
and even prepared the money for you?

420
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,540
How ungrateful and selfish you are!

421
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,510
You got a good man killed.

422
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,230
Your husband is gone too.

423
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:32,670
What will you do now?

424
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:35,940
It's fine.

425
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,910
I have a way to help you out.

426
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,140
Help me identify him.

427
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,030
The company will handle
all your medical needs.

428
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,140
Is it okay?

429
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,030
Zhao Chuxi,

430
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,670
why are you talking so much?

431
00:21:53,910 --> 00:21:55,510
Stay here today.

432
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:56,990
Come on, guys.

433
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,510
Mrs. Wang, it's fine.

434
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,140
Don't be afraid.

435
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,540
Close your eyes. You'll see nothing.

436
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,670
Yes, exactly.

437
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,860
It'll be over in no time.

438
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,430
Mrs. Wang, no need to cry. It's all done.

439
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:37,940
Mr. Wu,

440
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,780
are you playing hide-and-seek with me?

441
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,140
Come out now.

442
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,540
Just wait to face the consequences.

443
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,910
Why not serve me some?

444
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,620
It's been a while since I had hot pot.

445
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,030
How's the progress going?

446
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,710
I haven't had hot pot for long.

447
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,380
Just let me finish my hot pot in peace,

448
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,970
then we'll talk about serious matters.

449
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,430
I'm sick of eating Western food every day.

450
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,710
Duck intestines here.

451
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,900
Alright, thank you.

452
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,540
Why are you all staring at me?

453
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,030
You look like you're enjoying it.

454
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,700
You don't trust me?

455
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,950
Did I ever say it to you,

456
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,100
as long as the backbone stays strong,

457
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,910
nothing will be a big deal?

458
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,040
Yeah.

459
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,270
Do you know how many people

460
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,000
I had to meet daily

461
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,570
and how far I had to travel this time?

462
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:45,060
I've been asking and searching all day.

463
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,860
Luckily, I managed to secure some funding.

464
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,060
Come on, stop being secretive.

465
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,030
Exactly how much did you get?

466
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:52,990
Give us the details.

467
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,470
So we can have a clear picture.

468
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,710
It's about...

469
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,540
How much?

470
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,030
500 million.

471
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:17,780
And that's just the initial amount.

472
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,030
After Chinese New Year,

473
00:24:19,030 --> 00:24:21,710
the fund and corporate consortium
will arrive in Sanjiang.

474
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,550
That's the big money.

475
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,580
Here, Xu.

476
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,470
You've worked hard.

477
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,810
Thank you. Here's a toast to you.

478
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,030
Look what you said.

479
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:33,750
Who's paying for this meal?

480
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:35,830
You.

481
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,990
Why are you still so stingy?

482
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:43,620
Sanjiang Group is lucky to have you.

483
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,430
I truly feel blessed.

484
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:47,770
Chuxi, let me tell you something.

485
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,430
I must fulfill the dream at Sanjiang Group

486
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,860
that I couldn't achieve in my youth.

487
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,420
Come on.

488
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,540
This toast is for your dreams.

489
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,700
Cheers!

490
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,430
Here you go!

491
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,140
Not bad, right?

492
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,820
Zhao Chuxi,

493
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,910
I just hired two skilled security guards.

494
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:35,140
They'd like to spar with your team.

495
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,060
You don't mind, do you?

496
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,950
Good for nothing!

497
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,670
Zhao Chuxi,

498
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,060
I'm here to negotiate with you.

499
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,510
Let's prioritize peace.

500
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,340
(Zone B)

501
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,950
Ms. Jian is the soul of Sanjiang Group.

502
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,670
She's the only boss I truly respect.

503
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:20,030
If she asks me to go through fire and water,

504
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,470
I'd risk my life without hesitation,

505
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,430
not even blinking an eye.

506
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:27,470
But now,

507
00:26:27,470 --> 00:26:30,140
I can't stand by and watch Ms. Jian's legacy

508
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,750
be ruined by you, Zhao Chuxi.

509
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,540
Let me be straightforward.

510
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,300
I want Wu Heping's shares

511
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,780
and his company's entire business.

512
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:42,750
From this day forward,

513
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,140
we'll stay out of each other's affairs.

514
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,070
Mr. He,

515
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,270
your second point is direct.

516
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,750
I appreciate honesty like that,

517
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:53,430
but your first point

518
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:54,910
sounds overly pretentious.

519
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:56,780
How can you be so sure

520
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,670
Ms. Jian's business will fail under me?

521
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,190
Let me share some news with you right now.

522
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:08,470
Sanjiang Group has reached
strategic partnership

523
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,860
with Fudu Group, Jingguang Industries
and Jiawei Group.

524
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,060
The next round of financing
will soon be completed.

525
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:18,230
Xu Lin, explain the specifics to them.

526
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,640
Starting from the beginning of the year,

527
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,100
the group will accelerate adjustments
to backward industries.

528
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,910
Multiple projects will launch simultaneously.

529
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,340
The total investment amount
will exceed one billion.

530
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,270
In other words,

531
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,780
Sanjiang Group's future won't fade,

532
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,780
it will thrive and grow rapidly.

533
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,140
Chen Tao,

534
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:42,540
do you think Ms. Jian's business
will fail under me?

535
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,620
No, absolutely not.

536
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:52,270
Don't worry. I've always supported you.

537
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:07,070
Mr. He,

538
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,670
what you're saying doesn't hold water at all.

539
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,230
Let me tell you this:

540
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,670
right is right,

541
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,060
and wrong is wrong.

542
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,340
Don't let greed blind you.

543
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,710
Just quit.

544
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,550
Zhao Chuxi,

545
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,750
one should know when to stop.

546
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,540
Don't push things too far.

547
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:33,620
Shouldn't you be the one stopping?

548
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,230
Do you think I don't know

549
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:38,060
you had Wu Heping harm Mr. Du?

550
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,540
You're a veteran member.

551
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,340
I leave you some dignity.

552
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,380
Don't make me regret it.

553
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:45,790
Fine.

554
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:49,580
You better remember what you said.

555
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,190
Are you threatening me?

556
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,030
Alright.

557
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:54,670
I'll give you one last chance.

558
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:58,100
80 million for all your shares.

559
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,310
Zhao Chuxi,

560
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,820
are you mocking me?

561
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:09,820
This is your second chance.

562
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,950
50 million to leave the company.

563
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,540
I'll give you five seconds to decide.

564
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,270
Five.

565
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,030
Four.

566
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,660
Three.

567
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,070
Two.

568
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,780
One. Xu Lin.

569
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:27,920
This is the file Ms. Jian left for you.

570
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,900
(Company bank account transaction statement)

571
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,920
Ms. Jian instructed me before she left.

572
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:53,190
Considering you're a veteran member,

573
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,910
she let me give you two chances.

574
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,580
If you don't agree,

575
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:59,710
I'll expose all the wrongdoings you've done

576
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:01,140
to the public

577
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,810
and ruin your reputation completely.

578
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,430
I don't know what you're thinking.

579
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,710
But you know it very well yourself.

580
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,910
Take care of yourselves.

581
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,740
(He Yuanshan's personal account shows
opaque transactions with the company account.)

582
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,580
Ms. Jian gave you two chances.

583
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:29,580
I am sensible, too.

584
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,950
I'll give you one more chance.

585
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,620
Mr. Zhao,

586
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,820
what if I give up everything now

587
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,540
and withdraw from the Board?

588
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:49,780
The wise man adapts to the times.

589
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,540
I lost!

590
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,620
(Defendant He Yuanshan
committed attempted murder,)

591
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,640

592
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,770

593
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:19,930

594
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,170
(combined penalties: 15 years in prison;)

595
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,230
(fined four million yuan.)

596
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,450
(ordered to return 120 million yuan
in illegal gains.)

597
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,660
(In accordance with Articles 29 and 232
of the Criminal Law,)

598
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,120
(defendant Wu Heping committed murder,
sentenced to 15 years.)

599
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:46,470
Distinguished leaders and guests,

600
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,430
