1
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,180
=My Name is Zhao Chuxi=

2
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,180
=Episode 23=

3
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:06,870
I hereby announce,

4
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:08,820
in accordance with the Board's bylaws,

5
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,950
11 members attended the meeting,

6
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:13,430
four voted in favor, and seven opposed.

7
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,710
The votes don't exceed 50%
of the voting rights

8
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,740
stipulated in the bylaws.

9
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,820
Zhao Chuxi will remain as chairman.

10
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:23,550
Du Xinan!

11
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:25,590
How dare you set me up!

12
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:26,900
Why are you doing this?

13
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:31,460
Her kindness to me

14
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,430
will never be forgotten.

15
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,870
(These eight words can explain)

16
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:41,590
(what kind of person moderate Du Xinan is.)

17
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,790
(You could say he's inflexible and rigid.)

18
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:45,540
(Or you could call him loyal to a fault.)

19
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,270
(Perhaps it's more accurate to say)

20
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,740
(Du Xinan doesn't support Zhao Chuxi)

21
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:50,670
(because of Zhao Chuxi himself.)

22
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,870
(The person whom he supported)

23
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,380
(has always been one, Ms. Jian.)

24
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:05,870
Mr. Du.

25
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,740
This is what I promised Ms. Jian.

26
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,270
I hereby announce,

27
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,610
the Board Meeting is officially concluded.

28
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,150
I'll arrange a venue

29
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,200
to host everyone for a gathering.

30
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,740
I hope you can all join me.

31
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,500
(Sanjiang Group)

32
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,940
(Zhao Chuxi successfully
takes over Sanjiang Group.)

33
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:33,150
(After the Board Meeting is concluded,)

34
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,710
(everyone finally realized)

35
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,220
(they had all been played by Du Xinan.)

36
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,320
Mr. Zhao.

37
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,620
Everyone has already arrived.

38
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,510
They've been waiting upstairs for a while.

39
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:54,620
I didn't expect everyone to show up.

40
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:58,030
They dare miss Aunt Jian's family dinner.

41
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,460
But they all came to my banquet.

42
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,390
They're showing me respect?

43
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,900
Maybe someone was unhappy with the meeting,

44
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,530
so they're here to cause trouble.

45
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,420
Let's go.

46
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,940
We'll confront them head-on.

47
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:16,670
Du Xinan,

48
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,030
don't you want to explain to us

49
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,740
why you agreed to Zhao Chuxi

50
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,900
becoming the chairman?

51
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,430
What?

52
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,430
Do you have some unspeakable deal

53
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,150
with Zhao Chuxi?

54
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,180
Ms. Jian just passed away.

55
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,060
Instead of protecting her business,

56
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,990
you're fighting for power and profit.

57
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,030
How absurd.

58
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,110
Du Xinan,

59
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:44,870
we don't like hearing those words.

60
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,180
Ms. Jian has passed away.

61
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,870
We've followed her for years.

62
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:51,390
Naturally, we'll support her successor.

63
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,180
Otherwise, why are we even here?

64
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,550
Mr. He's stance is exactly my stance.

65
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,310
So we'll support him.

66
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,390
It means the same thing anyway.

67
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,780
However,

68
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:04,900
Ms. Jian just passed away recently.

69
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,310
The company is now facing major crises.

70
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,220
But precisely because of this,

71
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,830
we need to stick together.

72
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:17,860
Zhao Chuxi is Ms. Jian's chosen successor.

73
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:21,390
But, Du,

74
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,300
tell me

75
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,100
if you are really willing to let

76
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,390
this newcomer to the company,

77
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,390
who knows nothing,

78
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,630
has no experience at all,

79
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:30,750
just a young and green kid,

80
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,420
start giving us orders, huh?

81
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,420
You might be fine with it, but we aren't.

82
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:36,630
Why should we entrust our future

83
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,750
to Zhao Chuxi?

84
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,590
Mr. Zhao is here.

85
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,900
Apologies, I'm late.

86
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,780
Traffic jam. Sorry to keep you waiting.

87
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,220
Please, have a seat.

88
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:52,190
Being early or late doesn't matter.

89
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,780
It's great that you're here.

90
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,860
Today is a great opportunity.

91
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,030
It's been a while since we gathered together.

92
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,750
Normally,

93
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,190
we're all too busy.

94
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,750
We should

95
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,460
thank you for that.

96
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,030
Mr. He, no need to be so polite.

97
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:08,510
This is what I should do.

98
00:05:08,830 --> 00:05:09,830
Zhao Chuxi,

99
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,750
sitting in this position isn't easy.

100
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,950
Some people

101
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,300
should weigh their capabilities carefully.

102
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,590
Zhao Chuxi,

103
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:22,300
do you know how dangerous this position is?

104
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:26,030
You're responsible for others' livelihoods.

105
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,070
It could even put your life at risk.

106
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,910
I understand.

107
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,420
Everyone here is a senior at the company.

108
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,540
The advice you're giving

109
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,150
is tough but well-meaning.

110
00:05:48,710 --> 00:05:50,540
I just took over the company.

111
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,130
There's still so much I need to learn.

112
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,750
I hope all of you can guide and support me.

113
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,100
You speak quite well.

114
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:10,870
Today,

115
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,070
I gather everyone here not just for dinner.

116
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,980
I want to discuss something with you all.

117
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,860
Since I recently took over the company,

118
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,420
I'm lacking experience and feel overwhelmed.

119
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,220
I'm sincerely hoping

120
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,630
that you seniors can help me.

121
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,140
Chuxi,

122
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,070
we want to help you too.

123
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,030
But you're just too young.

124
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,340
Let me be blunt.

125
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,030
Zhao Chuxi,

126
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,900
none of us really trust you.

127
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:52,870
Fine.

128
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,300
I'll be straightforward too.

129
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:59,420
Ms. Jian gave me this position.

130
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,390
I know

131
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,710
you all think I'm unqualified.

132
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,230
Honestly, so do I.

133
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,150
When Ms. Jian first told me about this,

134
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,030
I was confused too.

135
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,780
I was scared. I felt I lacked the ability.

136
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,220
Afraid I'd ruin this big company.

137
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,590
In the past,

138
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:17,980
if I was put

139
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,660
in a luxurious place like this,

140
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,400
I wouldn't have even dared to dream.

141
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,900
Even today, I feel it's a waste of money.

142
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:27,860
Ms. Jian once said,

143
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,780
I'm an ordinary guy without ambition.

144
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,300
It's true. What I just want is some money,

145
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:36,150
a wife, a car, and returning home proudly.

146
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,750
I can offer you five million right now.

147
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,980
Take the money and leave this position.

148
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:41,830
Can you do that?

149
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,750
What a joke.

150
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,190
If you'd said this to me a week ago,

151
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:51,100
I would've agreed without hesitation.

152
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:53,590
But now, that's impossible.

153
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:55,460
A person must honor their promises.

154
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:58,100
If I hadn't promised Ms. Jian,

155
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,220
I would've stayed far away from this.

156
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,190
It would've had nothing to do with me.

157
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,830
But now, I have to help the company

158
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:06,330
get through this critical period.

159
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,630
Once the company is back on track,

160
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,190
if you think I'm not capable enough,

161
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,520
and not qualified to take this position,

162
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,300
I can leave anytime.

163
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:19,780
Nice words.

164
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,780
But can you keep your word?

165
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:23,910
Of course.

166
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,540
I always keep my word.

167
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,780
But before that,

168
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:31,100
I hope everyone will cooperate with me.

169
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,420
I've said almost everything I need to.

170
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,420
I came here today for this meal,

171
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:37,030
not to make enemies with anyone.

172
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:40,540
I know you all are seniors at the company

173
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,510
and have your own ways of doing things.

174
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,700
Do whatever you wish.

175
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,390
I, Zhao Chuxi,

176
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,750
will face it head-on.

177
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,140
Come on.

178
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,030
I propose a toast to you.

179
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:36,740
Chuxi,

180
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:40,990
starting today, I'll leave the Board.

181
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,750
Fan Li will take my place on the Board.

182
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:48,870
I simultaneously resign from the Board

183
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:52,270
and step down as President of Sanjiang Group.

184
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,800
I recommend Xu Lin, the Vice President,

185
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,670
to take over as President of the Group.

186
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,700
(Sanjiang Group)

187
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,540
Mr. Du,

188
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:00,870
there's no need for this.

189
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,700
I've been planning this for a while.

190
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,110
I just didn't discuss it with you.

191
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,510
Xu Lin's presence reassures me

192
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,510
I can leave without worry.

193
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,700
Since that's the case,

194
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:15,870
the company's last Board seat

195
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,620
will be given to Zhang Chao.

196
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:19,230
This is just an exchange.

197
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:21,350
It's not about repaying a favor.

198
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:26,230
I didn't expect this outcome either.

199
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,660
Perhaps no one did.

200
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,750
You don't need to thank me.

201
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,230
This is what you deserve.

202
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:37,030
Mr. Du, did you decide
to support me early on,

203
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:39,060
or was it a last-minute decision?

204
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:40,300
What do you think?

205
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,180
I believe I understand now.

206
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:46,060
But, Mr. Du,

207
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,060
you've offended everyone

208
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:51,300
to help me take over Sanjiang Group.

209
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:55,350
I spent 50 years of life in vain.

210
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,230
Over a decade ago,

211
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,060
if it weren't for Ms. Jian,

212
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,420
my life would be worlds apart.

213
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,700
Shouldn't I already be content?

214
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,840
As for their intentions

215
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,110
and the schemes they might have

216
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:09,350
with Sanjiang Group,

217
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:11,030
how could I not be aware?

218
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:15,660
Sanjiang Group is the result of my hard work.

219
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:18,730
How could I let them destroy it?

220
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:20,660
They're watching you.

221
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,420
And so am I.

222
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,230
Ms. Jian is watching you too.

223
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,400
I don't know you well enough.

224
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,820
What kind of person are you?

225
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,630
Do you have the ability to control the Group?

226
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:35,180
Can you battle with these big players?

227
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,680
I need to observe step by step.

228
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:39,350
It's also a test for you.

229
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:42,660
If I revealed myself right from the start,

230
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:46,150
wouldn't that be too easy for you?

231
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,700
No pressure at all.

232
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:49,580
I can see clearly.

233
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,700
Xu Lin, Song Qingci, Furong and Huang Tu

234
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,940
all have great trust in you.

235
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,870
Gaining their trust itself

236
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,230
shows your capability.

237
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,310
Mr. Du,

238
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,470
no matter what,

239
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:08,230
I truly hope you'll stay and help me.

240
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,700
Xu Lin is more capable than I am.

241
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,350
Sanjiang Group will have a brighter future.

242
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,470
I'm already exhausted.

243
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,630
All these years,

244
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,030
I barely had time for my family.

245
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,900
It's time for us to enjoy some peace.

246
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,580
Alright, Mr. Du.

247
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,230
Since you've made up your mind,

248
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,350
I won't try to stop you.

249
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:36,700
Okay.

250
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,870
I wish you good health,

251
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,820
and happiness with your family.

252
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,660
Let's all keep doing our best.

253
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,380
Here, Mr. Du.

254
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,480
Take care on your way.

255
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,830
Qingyi,

256
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,580
we bought so many new clothes

257
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,450
and so many school supplies this time.

258
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,300
This is enough for two or three months.

259
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,170
Yes,

260
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,540
it should be enough for a while.

261
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:09,300
I'll come out again before the heavy snow.

262
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,700
Otherwise, we'll have to wait
until winter ends.

263
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,480
Hei,

264
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,840
thanks for helping me this time.

265
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,850
You're welcome, Qingyi.

266
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,820
The snow is so heavy these days.

267
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,300
If I didn't come with you, it'd be too risky.

268
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,530
Accidents could easily happen.

269
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:27,510
What's wrong, Qingyi?

270
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,180
I don't know why,

271
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:33,490
but I feel a tightness in my chest.

272
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:36,620
And my right eyelid keeps twitching.

273
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:40,030
Could you have caught a cold?

274
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,750
Why don't you hold on a bit longer?

275
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,900
We'll be in the village soon.

276
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,470
I'll make you some herbal soup.

277
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:45,470
I'm fine.

278
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,060
I'll be better soon. Let's go.

279
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,470
Take it slow, Qingyi.

280
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,300
Chuxi,

281
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,780
Mr. Du really resigned?

282
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,580
Why didn't you try to stop him?

283
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,900
Do you think I didn't try?

284
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,870
But it seems his mind is made up.

285
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,630
I guess he has his own plans.

286
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,060
Sanjiang Group will depend on you now.

287
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,020
Qingci.

288
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,070
Take a look.

289
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,350
This is this month's financial report.

290
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,630
Some departments performed quite well.

291
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,870
Here's the latest legal regulations.

292
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,300
I think you should review them.

293
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,420
If everything goes well,

294
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,630
the Jiatou's shares should be finalized soon.

295
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:40,510
This is one of Aunt Jian's trump cards.

296
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,470
We need to act discreetly

297
00:14:42,470 --> 00:14:44,350
to catch those old guys off guard.

298
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:45,870
Understood, Mr. Zhao.

299
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,420
You need to attend a few banquets next month.

300
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:52,750
Aunt Jian used to handle these events.

301
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,470
But now Aunt Jian is gone.

302
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,230
It's also the critical moment.

303
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,540
Your presence is even more crucial now.

304
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,150
You need to send a message to the public

305
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,940
that Sanjiang has transitioned leadership.

306
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,230
Sanjiang Group remains the same as before.

307
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,940
But now, it's the era of Zhao Chuxi.

308
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,900
Mr. Zhao!

309
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,070
Something bad happened!

310
00:15:12,794 --> 00:15:13,220
What is it?

311
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,540
He Yuanshan is holding a press conference.

312
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:18,470
He wants to make the subsidiary independent.

313
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,150
I hereby announce,

314
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,470
I'm withdrawing from the Board.

315
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:29,230
(Sanjiang Group's director withdraws)
Also, the subsidiary I was managing

316
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,870
(Subsidiary declares independence)
is officially declaring independence.

317
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,820
Both Wu Heping and Chen Tao

318
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,580
have also decided to withdraw from the Board.

319
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,810
Please share more with us.

320
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,510
He acted so quickly?

321
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,110
There is another piece

322
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,580
of bad news.

323
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,510
Go ahead.

324
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:51,630
Mr. Du had a car accident in Jiangbei.

325
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,660
When did it happen?

326
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,870
Just now.

327
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,150
He is in the hospital, fighting for his life.

328
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:57,210
Let's go. To the hospital.

329
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,180
Those are just rumors.

330
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,310
Furong,

331
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:16,230
don't you think this car accident is strange?

332
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,300
I think so too.

333
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,660
Let's wait till we reach Jiangbei to confirm.

334
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,110
Only He Yuanshan would dare to do this.

335
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,030
No one else has that kind of power.

336
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,630
But we can't be certain.

337
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,470
We're out in the open,

338
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,250
while they're operating in the shadows.

339
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,590
Watch out!

340
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,540
- Hei.
- Qingyi.

341
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,750
Have you noticed

342
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:00,870
how fluffy the snow is this year?

343
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,300
Yeah, it's fluffy.

344
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,470
This weight is really crushing.

345
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,310
Exactly.

346
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,950
Let's go. My feet are freezing.

347
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,230
The village...

348
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:19,460
It's gone.

349
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,230
Father!

350
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,820
Mother!

351
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:36,510
Father! Mother!

352
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:55,900
Chuxi...

353
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:56,980
Chuxi...

354
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:58,310
- Furong!
- Furong!

355
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,930
- Are you okay?
- Huang Tu!

356
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:01,030
Huang Tu!

357
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:02,470
Chuxi, what's wrong?

358
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,030
- Chuxi!
- What's wrong?

359
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,550
Chuxi!

360
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,620
Chuxi...

361
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,510
Ms. Li.

362
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,380
Mr. Li.

363
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:47,710
Mr. Li.

364
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,270
Mr. Li, Mr. Li!

365
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,820
You're finally back.

366
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,030
Mr. Li.

367
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:11,750
- Mr. Li.
- Mr. Li.

368
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,990
Mr. Li,

369
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,340
you're finally back.

370
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,470
The heavy snow collapsed houses.

371
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,510
To protect

372
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,300
and evacuate the villagers,

373
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,540
the village chief...

374
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,580
The village chief...

375
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,780
I'm back.

376
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,670
I'm back.

377
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:06,100
(Phoenix Village Elementary School)

378
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:14,710
You don't need to see me off.

379
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,380
Go back now.

380
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,540
Mr. Li, will you return again?

381
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:22,540
Mr. Li, when will you come back?

382
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,140
Of course I'll be back.

383
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:27,820
I still need to teach you all.

384
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,950
Phoenix Village has been submerged,

385
00:20:37,430 --> 00:20:38,950
but as long as we are alive,

386
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,230
a new Phoenix Village will rise.

387
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,100
Yes, as long as we are here, there is hope.

388
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,030
Yes, yes, that's right.

389
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,370
I will definitely come back someday.

390
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,030
(The mountains are still the same.)

391
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:13,470
(But Phoenix Village is no longer there.)

392
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:15,300
(At this moment,)

393
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,670
(Li Qingyi, who has persevered for years,)

394
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,340
(is finally leaving Phoenix Village.)

395
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,580
(Yet the way of leaving feels almost heroic.)

396
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:29,380
(Dust returns to dust, soil returns to soil.)

397
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,140
(Everything has finally come to rest.)

398
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,580
(The elementary school still remains.)

399
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,280
(The graves beside the school still stand.)

400
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,670
(Phoenix Village Elementary School)

401
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,670
(There lies Ping'an,)

402
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,430
(who never saw what a big city was like)

403
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,820
(even at the moment of death;)

404
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,380
(there lies the mother of Zhao Chuxi;)

405
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,670
(there lies the father of Zhao Chuxi;)

406
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:52,380
(there lies the old principal;)

407
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,430
(there lies the village chief who died)

408
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,340
(while organizing the evacuation.)

409
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,270
Who could possibly do this?

410
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,950
If it's not He Yuanshan,

411
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,330
I truly can't think of anyone else.

412
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,750
Both He Yuanshan and Wu Heping are suspects.

413
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,990
By the way, how is Mr. Du?

414
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,670
He will be bedridden for the rest of my life.

415
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:34,300
They are warning me.

416
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:39,980
Chuxi,

417
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,220
what do we do now?

418
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,090
(At this moment, Zhao Chuxi realizes)

419
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,990
(he had oversimplified the situation.)

420
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,270
(His actions now)

421
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:51,380
(are indeed affecting others.)

422
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:54,140
(This isn't a little money.)

423
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,380
(He hesitated for a moment.)

424
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,950
(Was this choice right or wrong?)

425
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,190
(A promise is simple.)

426
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:04,950
(But it could implicate himself and others.)

427
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,230
(Or perhaps it requires a heavy price.)

428
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:12,620
(Yujing Longcheng)

429
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:17,910
Who are you?

430
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,030
I'm Li Qingyi.

431
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:21,540
I'm here to see Zhao Chuxi.

432
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,180
Wait a moment.

433
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:31,790
Zhao,

434
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,990
someone's here to see you.

435
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:33,860
Who is it?

436
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,820
She says her name is Li Qingyi.

437
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:50,460
Sis,

438
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,270
why are you here?

439
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,380
What happened?

440
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,140
Did you hear something?

441
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:03,710
I'm fine here.

442
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,430
It's just a minor injury, look.

443
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,470
I'm perfectly fine, arms and legs intact.

444
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:09,190
You don't need to worry about me.

445
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,620
Are you worried that I'm doing better now

446
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,060
and I'll forget where I came from?

447
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:25,380
No worries. I promised

448
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,880
to build a school and pave the roads,

449
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,440
make the surrounding villages envy us

450
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,810
and bring honor to Phoenix Village.

451
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,230
I'll definitely make it happen.

452
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,270
Absolutely.

453
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,230
What's wrong? Say something!

454
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:45,860
The village is gone.

455
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,710
What's gone?

456
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:49,820
Phoenix Village is gone.

457
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,100
Gone...

458
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,820
The snow was too heavy.

459
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,580
The village houses collapsed.

460
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,750
To protect everyone,

461
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:06,360
the old village chief

462
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,180
didn't come out.

463
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:19,820
Didn't come out...

464
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,190
Didn't come out...

465
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,620
Didn't come out...

466
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,750
Gone...

467
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:31,750
Didn't come out...

468
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,590
Gone...

469
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,750
I'll go out and make money soon.

470
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,910
Who will you listen to when I'm not here?

471
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,990
Listen to Ms. Li.

472
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,620
Go check on him.

473
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:37,230
Let him be alone for a while.

474
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,950
I'm going for a smoke.

475
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,220
I'll go too.

476
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,580
Something's wrong! Chuxi is missing!

477
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:14,670
Where could he go alone at this time?

478
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,140
- Phoenix Village?
- Impossible.

479
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,540
Anywhere is possible, but not that village.

480
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,510
Why not?

481
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:23,060
He said he wouldn't return without success.

482
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,510
In his current state,

483
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,990
he won't return to Phoenix Village.

484
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,060
What exactly is he planning to do?

485
00:28:31,270 --> 00:28:33,130
He's abandoned such a massive responsibility.

486
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,510
What does he want the group to do?

487
00:28:34,910 --> 00:28:35,750
Furong.

488
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,470
Phoenix Village is like Chuxi's lifeblood.

489
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,860
Why did he leave for the city back then?

490
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,950
Now the village is gone.

491
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:48,190
It's like Chuxi has lost his foundation.

492
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,270
Aunt Jian trusted Chuxi with the group.

493
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,620
I believe Chuxi knows what he's doing.

494
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,340
Right now, in the group,

495
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,270
we have Mr. Xu and Qingci.

496
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:59,860
The rest is up to us to handle.

497
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,540
No matter what,

498
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,100
we must find Chuxi.

499
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,710
If we truly can't find him,

500
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,980
we'll wait for him to come back.

501
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,030
No need to search for him.

502
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,670
If he wants to leave,

503
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,470
no one can bring him back.

504
00:29:12,190 --> 00:29:15,430
I think as long as Chuxi hasn't fallen,

505
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,190
there's still hope.

506
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:54,460
(One week later)

507
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,070
Chuxi,

508
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,580
life is all

509
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,950
(Qin Ran's Tomb)
about solving problems

510
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,860
and overcoming obstacles

511
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,710
one by one.

512
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,710
Sis,

513
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:17,860
if a road is built in our village,

514
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:20,670
the medical problem will be resolved, right?

515
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,030
My parents and Ping'an

516
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:26,270
wouldn't have died because of heavy snow.

517
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:28,430
And Dad wouldn't have missed treatment

518
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,300
(Tomb of Mother Li Xiuzhu and Father Li Chengqian)
due to being trapped by snow.

519
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,140
You said,

520
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,860
that's the place Dad swore to protect,

521
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,540
so you have to guard it too.

522
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:39,820
You leave here for now because you want

523
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,230
to make money to improve the village.

524
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,510
I should go now.

525
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,060
I'll visit you every year.

526
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,590
Don't worry.

527
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,140
I know what I need to do.

528
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,750
I've figured it out.

529
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,580
I won't let them take me down.

530
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:04,140
Just like you said,

531
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:09,430
I'll overcome these obstacles one by one.

532
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,820
(Qin Ran's Tomb)
I'll move forward firmly.

533
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,470
Sir, show me your ticket, please.

534
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,910
Train K1394.

535
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:44,620
Please pay attention to your stop.

536
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,100
- Have a chat, miss?
- Sir,

537
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,380
please mind your behavior.

538
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,750
Don't be so uptight.

539
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,100
Let's grab a meal and chat together.

540
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,230
Get to know each other.

541
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:53,700
(Book of the Later Han)
I

542
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,710
do have some influence in Sanjiang.

543
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,060
Sorry, sir.

544
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,300
We have a policy.

545
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,430
Meeting passengers privately is not allowed.

546
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,780
If that's your attitude,

547
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,950
I'll have to complain you.

548
00:32:03,950 --> 00:32:04,790
Do as you please.

549
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:06,950
I'm inviting you to dinner out of courtesy.

550
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,340
Don't push your luck.

551
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,990
Liu Jiren.

552
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:14,880
Jiangcheng Real Estate.

553
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,950
This is the budget
for the Jiangcheng Real Estate,

554
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,780
a subsidiary of Sanjiang Group.

555
00:32:19,910 --> 00:32:21,190
You need to sign it.

556
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,300
Liu Jiren.

557
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:28,270
What kind of name is that?

558
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,540
Deputy GM, huh?

559
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,580
What are you doing here?

560
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,710
What's the matter, buddy?

561
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,970
Are you planning to get involved in this?

562
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,140
Jiangcheng Real Estate belongs
to Sanjiang Group.

563
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:41,380
You're not clueless, are you?

564
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,670
Sanjiang Group?

565
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,750
Interesting.

566
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,750
What?

567
00:32:46,950 --> 00:32:49,750
You know someone from Sanjiang Group?

568
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:51,820
Whether you are planning to complain her,

569
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,340
I won't stop you.

570
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,750
But since you mentioned Sanjiang Group,

571
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,510
that's quite the coincidence.

572
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,230
I also work at Sanjiang Group.

573
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:05,670
You also work at Sanjiang Group?

574
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,430

575
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,030

576
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,780
The General Manager is Furong.

577
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,910
The Deputy GMs are Fan Li and Huang Tu.

578
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,750
Am I correct?

579
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,910
So what's your name

580
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,340
and your position?

581
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:22,540
My name is Zhao Chuxi.

582
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,620
