00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,180
=Episode 10=

3
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,720
Ms. Su.

4
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,210
Chuxi, have a seat.

5
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,130
Chuxi,

6
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,960
thanks to you,

7
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:16,090
our deal with Huaqiang Group is nearly done.

8
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,800
How is it thanks to me?

9
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,600
Xu Lin said you two are close friends.

10
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,040
That's true.

11
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:24,650
His boss's birthday is in a few days.

12
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:25,880
I bought some gifts.

13
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:27,440
I'm thinking,

14
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,290
maybe you can ask Xu Lin to pass them.

15
00:01:29,290 --> 00:01:31,160
- No problem?
- No problem.

16
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,770
Lu Yao, you haven't eaten yet, right?

17
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:36,610
I have.

18
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,570
But you didn't eat enough, did you?

19
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,960
I actually didn't eat enough.

20
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,440
I'll go have some more.

21
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:00,160
When is your birthday?

22
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,490
I don't know.

23
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,800
Birthday.

24
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:08,040
You don't know? You must be kidding.

25
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,400
I don't celebrate that.

26
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,050
Alright, no gift then.

27
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:15,770
So kind, huh?

28
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:18,560
My boss wants to give me a gift?

29
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,810
I'm still your boss.

30
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,450
You've helped me a lot.

31
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,650
How about giving you a birthday gift?

32
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,170
It's unnecessary.

33
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:34,010
Zhao Chuxi,

34
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,410
I didn't pressure you, right?

35
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,530
You can choose not to speak.

36
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,000
What do you mean by unnecessary?

37
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:50,890
Ms. Su.

38
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,050
Let me ask you one last time.

39
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,930
When is your birthday?

40
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:56,720
Tell me.

41
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,000
I really don't celebrate birthdays.

42
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,640
Every year on my birthday,

43
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,040
I feel uneasy inside.

44
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,810
What's uneasy about a birthday?

45
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,680
Most people are happy on birthdays.

46
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,450
My birthday is my parents' death anniversary.

47
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,960
I'm sorry, Chuxi.

48
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,720
I didn't mean it that way.

49
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
I just wanted to give you a gift.

50
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,090
Don't worry about it.

51
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:33,930
It's nothing.

52
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,770
Don't be sad, I...

53
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,640
Ms. Su, I have something to do.

54
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,840
I'll get busy first.

55
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:55,980
(Langtaosha Business Club)

56
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,520
Hello?

57
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,680
You need to pay the surgery fee soon.

58
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,050
I understand.

59
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,570
I'll gather the 400,000 soon.

60
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,480
Alright, I'll hang up now.

61
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:21,600
Don't worry.

62
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,090
Alright, hanging up.

63
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,960
Qin Ran,

64
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,520
what's going on with you?

65
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,280
Nothing.

66
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,610
Don't hide it from me.

67
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,920
I heard everything just now.

68
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,040
Do you need money because of your dad?

69
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,250
Let me tell you,

70
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,690
don't worry about it.

71
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,210
Worrying won't help anyway.

72
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,890
I actually have a good idea.

73
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,130
It might solve your urgent problem.

74
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,720
What do you suggest?

75
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,330
Well,

76
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,960
I know a boss.

77
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,440
He's super wealthy

78
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,450
and very generous.

79
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,160
If you meet him,

80
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,210
he might lend you money.

81
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,210
Alright.

82
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,650
Not bad.

83
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:33,880
Well done, Qiao Kang.

84
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,720
Alright.

85
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,040
You go ahead.

86
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,520
What you promised...

87
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,160
I won't let you down.

88
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,040
Thanks. Really, thanks.

89
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,520
Sit down.

90
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,640
I'll wait for you outside.

91
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,840
Have a good chat with him.

92
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,960
He's a good guy.

93
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,240
Be good.

94
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:48,890
Come here.

95
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,400
Have a seat, miss.

96
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,690
Miss,

97
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,040
I heard you need money lately.

98
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:01,570
Alright.

99
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,210
I'll get straight to the point.

100
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,760
I

101
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,210
find you quite appealing.

102
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:11,330
I want you to be my girlfriend.

103
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:17,280
I can offer you 100,000 a month.

104
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,120
Of course,

105
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:20,840
if you agree,

106
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:25,450
I can give you six months' allowance now.

107
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,040
Stand right there.

108
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,920
I'll give you a day to think it over.

109
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,810
Let me know anytime once you decide.

110
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,330
It's easy to reach me.

111
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,520
Qiao Kang has my contact info.

to defeat opponents)

113
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,450
Qin Ran.

114
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,330
What's up?

115
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,360
Nothing.

116
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:19,880
Just want to see you.

117
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,920
Where are you?

118
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,200
I'll come to you.

119
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,480
I'm at the barbecue spot.

120
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,360
Alright, wait there. I'm coming over.

121
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,120
Okay.

122
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,940
(Fusheng BBQ)

123
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:50,600
What's going on with you?

124
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:53,600
You don't look very cheerful.

125
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:55,840
It's nothing.

126
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,130
Maybe because I've been at the hospital.

127
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,350
I haven't been sleeping well.

128
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,160
Is your dad's condition worsening?

129
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,250
The doctor said it's not good.

130
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,520
Do you have enough money for it?

131
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,570
Yeah, I do.

132
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,520
Stop pretending with me.

133
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,400
I rushed to gather this much.

134
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,520
Take it for now. Consider it a loan.

135
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,160
Let me know if you need more later.

136
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:32,880
Qin Ran,

137
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,760
trust me,

138
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,530
we'll get through every hardship.

139
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:42,290
After the storm, there may not be a rainbow,

140
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,480
but you'll definitely see the sun.

141
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:45,690
Right?

142
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,130
Thanks a lot.

143
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,760
No need to be so polite with me.

144
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,560
I should be thanking you.

145
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,130
You're the first to listen to me

146
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,570
rambling about my own stuff.

147
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,330
Which is more important, appearance or soul?

148
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:09,850
The soul, I guess.

149
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,840
Without a soul, wouldn't a person be dead?

150
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,210
Why are you asking a philosophical problem?

151
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,360
Nothing.

152
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,570
I read two books.

153
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,850
Questions from the book.

154
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:21,810
What books?

155
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,720
My Beliefs won't Be Lost.

156
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,760
My Beliefs won't Be Lost?

157
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,250
Don't worry about losing them.

158
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,410
Let's eat first.

159
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,450
He, ready to order.

160
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,720
I'm here.

161
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,250
Mrs. Lin, I still think

162
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,160
it's better to stay in the hospital.

163
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,570
I've been in the hospital over a month.

164
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,050
Nowhere's as good as home.

165
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,160
You

166
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,050
don't try to persuade me.

167
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,960
I know my own body best.

168
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:13,920
Plus, here I can

169
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,960
see my grandson every day.

170
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,450
Also,

171
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,040
I can chat with you often, right?

172
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,000
It's better than being in a hospital.

173
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,930
I've been at this home

174
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,840
half my life.

175
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,880
I really can't bear to leave.

176
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,480
Even if that day comes,

177
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:45,640
I want to leave from this home,

178
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,400
- not from a hospital.
- Granny,

179
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,640
please don't say that.

180
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,210
Your words...

181
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,090
It sounds a bit old-fashioned.

182
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,960
But it's the truth.

183
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:57,960
Let's settle on that.

184
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,290
Listen to me on this.

185
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,680
Oh right, you are busy.

186
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,330
Go on with your work.

187
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,050
I'll take a break.

188
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,170
You take a rest.

189
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,360
You take a rest.

190
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:13,840
Granny, take it easy.

191
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,760
Huang Mao.

192
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,760
Zhao, where are you?

193
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,530
Come quickly, Qin Ran is in trouble.

194
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,170
Hurry up, hurry up!

195
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,360
Got it.

196
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,410
Ran,

197
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,240
are you really quitting?

198
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,400
I've already written my resignation.

199
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,480
Are you sure about this?

200
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,810
Of course I am.

201
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,040
I've discussed everything

202
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,340
with that boss who's chasing me.

203
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,250
Alright, Mao.

204
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,570
I hope we are all doing well.

205
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,170
Thank you for taking care of me.

206
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,480
I'm off. My friends are waiting.

207
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,560
Zhao, why are you so late?

208
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,000
- Where is she?
- In the office.

209
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:47,330
What's going on?

210
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:48,680
I heard Qin Ran will leave

211
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,920
with that chubby guy for money.

212
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,570
Just for some money?

213
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,920
What chubby guy?

214
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,010
Just a fat guy.

215
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,930
As friends, we must help her.

216
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,120
Let's go.

217
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,560
Come with me.

218
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:04,250
What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?

219
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,530
You're hurting me.

220
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,040
If you have troubles, you can talk to me.

221
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:10,880
Zhao Chuxi.

222
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,160
Are you trying to cause trouble here?

223
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,000
Qiao Kang,

224
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,690
you're the one making troubles, huh?

225
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:20,370
What nonsense are you talking about?

226
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:22,280
I haven't dealt with you yet.

227
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,680
Don't push your luck.

228
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,210
Are you out of your mind?

229
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:27,600
Someone! Get him out of here!

230
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,760
Let me see who dares to touch him.

231
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,690
Tell me the real reason.

232
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,330
Didn't I tell you about this earlier?

233
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:54,090
If you're short on money, just let me know.

234
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,690
But I need 400,000. Can you manage that?

235
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:04,240
I can't just watch my dad die.

236
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,360
Yes,

237
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:08,240
I've compromised.

238
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,120
So what?

239
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:15,210
I can offer the 400,000.

240
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,210
Do you have it?

241
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,600
Do you have it?

242
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,360
No?

243
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,170
Then get out of here.

244
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,570
(Zhao Chuxi,)

245
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,610
(you think you've found your footing)

246
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:41,840
(in this city)

247
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,480
(and realize you're nothing at the end.)

248
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,800
(You believed leaving Phoenix Village)

249
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,480
(would make you succeed in the city.)

250
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,400
(Now you understand)

251
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,760
(how useless you really are.)

252
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,040
(These leeches)

253
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,810
(struck when Qin Ran was vulnerable.)

254
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,170
(Zhao Chuxi,)

255
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,050
(you're just a coward.)

256
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,210
If I give you 400,000,

257
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,720
then you won't go with him, right?

258
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,410
Why?

259
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:25,840
I don't want you to compromise.

260
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,120
I must do what I believe is right.

261
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:32,570
We must control our own destiny.

262
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,930
400,000 yuan.

263
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:14,000
Qiang, you don't need to worry.

264
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:16,330
Chuxi will handle it.

265
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:20,330
How did this even happen?

266
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:23,120
We know Chuxi's situation.

267
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,210
He wants to build schools and roads

268
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,250
at Phoenix Village.

269
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,330
Every month, he sent money home.

270
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,850
He just kept some pocket money.

271
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,290
We've seen him do this, right?

272
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,610
I admire him too,

273
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:35,050
but about today's issue...

274
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:46,720
That's how it all happened.

275
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,560
I know you want to help him

276
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,290
and lend him money,

277
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,290
but I feel,

278
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,000
Chuxi might not accept your help.

279
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,480
First,

280
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,600
he won't want

281
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,250
to mix money with brotherhood.

282
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,530
Second, if you give him so much money,

283
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,410
could it affect

284
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,730
your brotherly bond?

285
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
I understand what you're saying,

286
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,320
but Chuxi sees me as a brother,

287
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,120
and I see him as a brother too.

288
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,440
He needs help now.

289
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,530
I can't just ignore him.

290
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,640
Let's do this.

291
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:38,250
Sell this bracelet.

292
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,600
Selling it now could get you 50,000.

293
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:46,120
Give it to Chuxi.

294
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,010
If Chuxi refuses,

295
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,250
just tell him,

296
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:52,120
I say he's doing the right thing

297
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,970
and ask him to accept this bracelet.

298
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,920
Take it.

299
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:01,640
Don't worry.

300
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,600
Rise and fall come together.

301
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:08,600
This might be good for Chuxi.

302
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:13,530
Maybe he'll learn a lot from this.

303
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,400
Chuxi,

304
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,200
I've got 40,000 yuan here.

305
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:32,970
It's everything I have.

306
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,200
Take it.

307
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:36,570
Thanks, Qiang.

308
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,330
Once I sort everything out,

309
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,050
I'll pay you back quickly.

310
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,600
It's a deal.

311
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:52,120
This is gathered by the workers.

312
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,250
Everyone has families to feed too.

313
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,200
Please don't think it's too little.

314
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,570
Not at all.

315
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,530
Thank them for me.

316
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,200
I'll repay everyone as soon as I can.

317
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:07,730
Chuxi,

318
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,970
I have 50,000 yuan here.

319
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,090
Take it first.

320
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,290
How did you get so much money?

321
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,800
Granny gave me a bracelet.

322
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,840
I sold it.

323
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,930
How could you sell her bracelet?

324
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,450
Granny said you did the right thing.

325
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,920
I also think you did the right thing.

326
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,410
So I sold it.

327
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,730
You can use this for now.

328
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,730
Please thank her for me.

329
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,770
All of this

330
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:33,360
is because we're just too broke.

331
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,360
So many of us pool our money together,

332
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:37,600
but it's still quite far from 400,000.

333
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,880
I have an idea.

334
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:44,120
You could borrow from Ms. Su.

335
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,490
No, I can't.

336
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,400
Listen.

337
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,080
This amount is too much for us,

338
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,690
but it's nothing for Ms. Su.

339
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:56,640
Do you have another idea?

340
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,530
I give it a try?

341
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,330
Stop, stop.

342
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,220
No outsiders is allowed inside.

343
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,250
Please turn back.

344
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,280
What's going on?

345
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,200
Zhao.

346
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,760
You're new here, so you don't know

347
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,080
this is Ms. Su's car.

348
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,650
Zhao is Mr. Su's assistant.

349
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:22,600
Go inside.

350
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,120
Zhao, what brings you here?

351
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,330
I need to see Ms. Su urgently.

352
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:27,330
Hurry up.

353
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:30,330
Thanks, buddy. Let's chat later.

354
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,440
Here, here, here.

355
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,770
Everyone, look here.

356
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,280
Let me say a few words.

357
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,330
I'm speaking now.

358
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:03,730
Here, here, here.

359
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:08,450
♪Open the door to the sound of wind and rain♪

360
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,750

365
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,680
Chuxi.

366
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,810
Sis, aren't you resting yet?

367
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,010
Not yet, I'm still grading papers.

368
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:39,570
Make sure you get some rest.

369
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:41,440
You can't fall ill.

370
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,640
You're the only teacher in Phoenix Village.

371
00:21:44,010 --> 00:21:45,410
If you wear yourself out,

372
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,970
what would the kids do?

373
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,640
I know.

374
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:52,770
Sis,

375
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,680
I might disappoint you.

376
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:56,920
What's wrong?

377
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,360
If I don't do some things,

378
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,200
I might not feel ease.

379
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,120
I need money,

380
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,730
a lot of money.

381
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,500
The money for saving a life.

382
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,010
A friend's father needs surgery money.

383
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,890
I can't just watch a family

384
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:13,970
fall apart like this.

385
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:17,680
Don't worry, sis.

386
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:19,920
I won't forget the road repairs.

387
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,810
I'll work even harder.

388
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:25,600
Chuxi,

389
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,120
no matter what happens,

390
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,090
as long as you've made up your mind,

391
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,640
I'm here to support you.

392
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:34,200
Yeah, I know.

393
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:37,040
It's getting late.

394
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,730
I still have a lot of homework to grade.

395
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,250
You should sleep early too.

396
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,320
Please remind

397
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,440
those little kids at school

398
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,080
to study hard,

399
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,510
so they can have a successful future.

400
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,810
Don't end up like me

401
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,440
feeling so defeated.

402
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,200
Got it.

403
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,330
Good night.

404
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,820
(Separate Journeys)

405
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,770
Ms. Su, Zhao Chuxi is here.

406
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,250
Let him in.

407
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,440
Alright.

408
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:30,640
Have a seat.

409
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:35,840
What brings you here?

410
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,320
To borrow money.

411
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,330
400,000.

412
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,360
How much?

413
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,330
400,000.

414
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:44,360
400,000?

415
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,400
Why do you need so much?

416
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,640
To help someone find peace.

417
00:23:54,890 --> 00:23:55,760
A woman?

418
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,640
Yes.

419
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
It's a woman.

420
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,360
You met her at Langtaosha?

421
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:14,680
Zhao Chuxi, before I get mad,

422
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,200
you'd better figure out what you're doing.

423
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,160
You've just started your job,

424
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,840
and you're asking me for so much money,

425
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,400
and it's all because of a woman.

426
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,490
A woman you met at Langtaosha.

427
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:31,560
Are you out of your mind?

428
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,990
How has she captivated you like this?

429
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:33,920
400,000?

430
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,920
Have you thought about the consequences?

431
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,330
Have you considered its worth?

432
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,600
This isn't a business deal.

433
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,520
You can't just evaluate coldly.

434
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,640
Am I being cold?

435
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,600
Zhao Chuxi, am I cold?

436
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,880
You're so righteous.

437
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,730
Truly noble and grand.

438
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,290
You don't evaluate, right?

439
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:57,010
Sorry, I need to evaluate.

440
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,490
I run a company.

441
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,250
I need to evaluate everything.

442
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,800
Regarding this matter,

443
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,290
my evaluation result is,

444
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,640
you're not worthy.

445
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,570
I'm really disappointed in you.

446
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:11,760
I won't lend you money.

447
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,600
Just go.

448
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,810
Actually, when I came here,

449
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,650
I already knew the outcome.

450
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,400
What do you even know?

451
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,010
Zhao Chuxi, you know nothing.

452
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,250
What do you take me for?

453
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,770
A Langtaosha masseuse?

454
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,250
Have you thought about my feelings?

455
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,800
I don't want to see you these days.

456
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,010
Just go, just go.

457
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,770
Alright, Ms. Su.

458
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:41,880
I'll leave now.

459
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:48,730
By the way, Ms. Su.

460
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,400
I have one more thing to tell you.

461
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,730
Tomorrow,

462
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:59,090
I won't be coming to work.

463
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,210
Thanks for all your support.

464
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,770
I know you've truly helped me.

465
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,490
Let me treat you sometime.

466
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:11,090
What do you mean, Zhao Chuxi?

467
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:16,330
You've become quite impressive.

468
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,450
I don't lend you money,

469
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:20,090
so you will resign?

470
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,200
Is this a threat?

471
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:23,490
How nice.

472
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:25,800
Fine, an ungrateful person.

473
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,410
Why do I need you here?

474
00:26:27,410 --> 00:26:28,280
Just leave now.

475
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,890
Go as far as you can. Go!

476
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:30,770
No, Ms. Su,

477
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,970
I'm not threatening you.

478
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,810
I'm just standing firm in my belief.

479
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:38,730
If you need my help,

480
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,690
I'll do it as well.

481
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,640
Get lost.

482
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,250
If you need anything,

483
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,890
reach out to me anytime.

484
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:46,810
I'm leaving now.

485
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,680
Zhao Chuxi, you fool.

486
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,440
(Zhao Chuxi,)

487
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,640
(as long as you hold onto your beliefs,)

488
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,680
(no matter the past pain)

489
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:15,570
(or the current setbacks,)

490
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:18,290
(they are just the start of your success.)

491
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,400
(I'll always be by your side.)

492
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,160
Dad, where's Mom?

493
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,050
I'm sorry.

494
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:55,640
I still haven't found your mom.

495
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,570
I already guessed that.

496
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:02,810
Dad, what's this?

497
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:04,770
Come.

498
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,640
Quickly, take a look.

499
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,450
This is your brother.

500
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,160
His name is Zhao Chuxi.

501
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,360
From now on,

502
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,440
you'll be his sister.

503
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:24,440
What about his parents?

504
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,290
They went to the same place

505
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,840
with your mom.

506
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,440
Chuxi, don't be afraid.

507
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,530
I'll take care of you.

508
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,510
Hello?

509
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:02,770
Qingyi,

510
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:07,400
long time no see.

511
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,330
Zhao.

512
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,680
What happened?

513
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,250
Maybe I can lend a hand.

514
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,600
Maodun,

515
00:29:21,410 --> 00:29:22,600
maybe

516
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,290
I won't come here often.

517
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,490
If Ms. Su needs anything,

518
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,840
please keep an eye out for me.

519
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,770
Contact me if something's off.

520
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:31,920
Zhao,

521
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,050
what's going on with Ms. Su and you?

522
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,400
Nothing much.

523
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:36,970
It's my personal reason.

524
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,760
I resigned.

525
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,290
I want to find another job.

526
00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:43,360
I'll join you for drinks soon.

527
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,290
Drinking sounds great, Zhao.

528
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,770
I'll definitely outdrink you.

529
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:49,320
Don't worry about Ms. Su, Zhao.

530
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,010
I'll call if anything comes up.

531
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,040
Yeah.

532
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,890
Zhao, what kind of work are you looking for?

533
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:56,530
I haven't decided yet.

534
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,120
Jobs aren't easy these days.

535
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,160
I'll keep looking.

536
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,730
I believe in you, Zhao.

537
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,770
Golden scales are not ordinary fish.

538
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,730
I wish you great success.

539
00:30:08,010 --> 00:30:09,810
You'll definitely do amazing things.

540
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,400
Thank you, my friend.

541
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,050
Maodun,

542
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:17,160
are you planning to work as a guard?

543
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,050
I think it's better to learn a skill.

544
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,600
At least you can do some technical work.

545
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,730
Have a skill

546
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,800
and then don't let yourself regret

547
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,290
due to today's lack of effort.

548
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,330
I'm leaving.

549
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:59,920
Zhao Chuxi, are you really resigning?

550
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,050
For a living.

551
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:05,090
Yeah, it's for a living.

552
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,400
I'll pass the resignation to Ms. Su.

553
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:11,360
Hope we can work together again someday.

554
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:12,970
I hope so.

555
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,860
(Resignation; Zhao Chuxi)

556
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,710
Hello? Dad.

557
00:31:41,710 --> 00:31:44,440
Xiluo, what did you do to upset Xu Shaoqing?

558
00:31:44,890 --> 00:31:47,290
Why did Zhang's Group stop funding us?

559
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,530
Apologize to him.

560
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,210
Dad, don't worry.

561
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,360
I'll go ask him.

562
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,600
Xiluo,

563
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,490
I'm begging you, please.

564
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,120
Go and beg him.

565
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:58,080
Alright, alright.

566
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,170
Dad, don't worry.

567
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,200
I understand. I'll handle it. No worries.

568
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,400
How are your parents?

569
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,360
Did you do it?

570
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,490
I don't know what you mean.

571
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:22,730
Xu Shaoqing,

572
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,410
Zhang's Group stopped funding us.

573
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,330
You didn't know that?

574
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,920
Did it?

575
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,290
Alright.

576
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:35,570
I'm sorry.

577
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:38,080
If it's because I stood you up that day,

578
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,090
I apologize to you.

579
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:42,330
Xiluo, do you think that's the reason?

580
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,010
You misunderstood.

581
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,770
I didn't take it seriously.

582
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,530
But,

583
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:56,330
my dad was really upset.

584
00:32:56,790 --> 00:32:57,650
Mr. Zhang?

585
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,770
I've already told you

586
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,200
he cared a lot about that gathering.

587
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:04,200
He always saw you as a daughter-in-law.

588
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,330
But you didn't show up.

589
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:09,920
How could he not be angry?

590
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:15,810
Alright.

591
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:17,600
Just tell me directly

592
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,160
what I should do now

593
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:21,530
to make your dad happy.

594
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,090
That's not hard.

595
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:26,840
I'm willing to talk to my dad for you,

596
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:32,840
but

597
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,200
I need your help.

598
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,050
Consider it

599
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,050
as a condition you agree to.

600
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,050
What condition?

601
00:33:42,410 --> 00:33:44,090
Come with me to meet my dad

602
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,640
in the name of my fiancée.

603
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:52,770
- Xu Shaoqing...
- I think it's the best way.

604
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,800
Can I take it

605
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,600
as you're threatening me now?

606
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,920
I'm trying to meet your demands.

607
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,880
How can this be a threat?

608
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:09,410
How about this?

609
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,800
Let's try a different approach.

610
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:15,410
You pretend to accept my proposal

611
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:17,680
and then meet my dad with me.

612
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:19,530
After that,

613
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,800
I'll hold a press conference

614
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:24,280
to announce our engagement.

615
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:26,890
What you need to do

616
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,680
is to keep smiling

617
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,490
and pretend you're happy.

618
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,720
After it's all over,

619
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,600
whether you stay or leave

620
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,570
