00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,180
=My Name is Zhao Chuxi=

2
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,180
=Episode 7=

3
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:17,890
Shaoqing.

4
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:22,250
Sorry, am I late?

5
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,290
Not at all.

6
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:26,290
You're right on time.

7
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:30,090
Did you pick out this outfit yourself today?

8
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,010
It's elegant and suits you perfectly.

9
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,450
I remember you said

10
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,570
that you want to create

11
00:01:38,570 --> 00:01:41,690
a private haute couture brand named Xiluo.

12
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,690
Still interested?

13
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,770
- What's private haute couture?
- I'll invest in you.

14
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:47,090
You wouldn't understand high society matters.

15
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:49,410
Not interested for now.

16
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,890
Let's talk when there's a chance.

17
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:51,970
Alright.

18
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:53,370
Then let's head inside.

19
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,250
Let's go.

20
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,450
I need to go in and work for Ms. Su.

21
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,090
I'm her personal assistant.

22
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,410
Personal assistant, huh?

23
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,410
Assistants can only wait outside.

24
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,610
Personal assistant, huh?

25
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,330
Assistants can only wait outside.

26
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,770
From Luoshen Group?

27
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,330
How... How do you know?

28
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:49,890
I've read your profile.

29
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,770
Zhao Chuxi, right?

30
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:53,690
Yes.

31
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:54,850
My name is Zhao Chuxi.

32
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:57,130
I'm Ms. Su's driver at Luoshen Group.

33
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,770
If I'm not mistaken,

34
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,170
you and Xu Shaoqing don't get along.

35
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,990
There's hostility between you two.

36
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,090
His hostility toward you

37
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,770
is because you're too close to Su Xiluo.

38
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,510
And your hostility toward him,

39
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:08,530
first,

40
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,530
you just can't stand his attitude;

41
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,890
second,

42
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,490
it's also because of Su Xiluo.

43
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:20,450
Don't you think this woman is a bit sly?

44
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:22,210
Using you as a pawn.

45
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,130
With your current strength,

46
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,850
what benefit is there

47
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,210
in opposing Xu Shaoqing?

48
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,570
You're here to gather intel, aren't you?

49
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,010
Smart.

50
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,250
Let me ask you one question.

51
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,250
Make your choice.

52
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,650
If I told you to stay neutral,

53
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,490
to advance or withdraw,

54
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,730
holding onto Su Xiluo tightly,

55
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,010
or distancing yourself from her,

56
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,290
what would you choose?

57
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,250
Do I have to answer?

58
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,850
If I tell you,

59
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:02,970
your answer will decide

60
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,130
whether the cooperation is successful.

61
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:06,770
Dare to bet?

62
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,690
I don't dare.

63
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,890
I don't have the leverage.

64
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:19,370
But,

65
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:21,810
I must tightly hold onto Su Xiluo.

66
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,330
She's my stepping stone.

67
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,530
If I leave her,

68
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,190
I'll definitely fall back to square one.

69
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:31,810
Smart,

70
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,290
bold, and ambitious.

71
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,050
But let me tell you this,

72
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,770
it's good for a man to have ambition.

73
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,030
But you must learn to keep it hidden.

74
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,550
Being too rigid can lead to failure.

75
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,930
I understand your desire

76
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,490
to rise above.

77
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,610
I fear poverty.

78
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,570
I lack money.

79
00:04:57,890 --> 00:04:59,250
Let me introduce myself.

80
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,170
My name is Xu Lin.

81
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,690
You really match my vibe.

82
00:05:03,850 --> 00:05:05,010
Would you like to be friends?

83
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:06,650
Sure.

84
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,570
Absolutely.

85
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,490
Xu, this...

86
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,130
This scene...

87
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,770
This is so-called high society, huh?

88
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,370
This is life.

89
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,170
Life is full of pretenses everywhere.

90
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,850
That's why so many people

91
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:30,770
will do anything to enter high society.

92
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:32,610
Those with no money or little money,

93
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,010
come here to make a living.

94
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,290
As for the wealthy ones,

95
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,650
they come here to prove their worth.

96
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,010
Remember this:

97
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:44,050
shallow waters, plenty of wannabes.

98
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,170
You'll only know,

99
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,410
who's swimming naked when the tide recedes.

100
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:49,970
Xu,

101
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,370
you must have seen a lot

102
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,330
to say that, huh?

103
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:58,610
How about I work with you?

104
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:01,130
(This guy is so shameless)

105
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,610
(that reminds me of my younger self.)

106
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,010
Get your footing first.

107
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,370
Then we'll talk when you're stronger.

108
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:17,050
At first, they were still on the fence.

109
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,890
But after your negotiation,

110
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,410
they're scrambling to invest in you

111
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,570
and afraid you'd run away.

112
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,930
Xiluo, you always manage to give me

113
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:27,930
unexpected surprises.

114
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,130
Not really.

115
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:29,970
Of course,

116
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,930
sometimes, there are tiny shocks too.

117
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,210
Like

118
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,210
that person.

119
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,610
Didn't you promise me

120
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,530
not to let him be your assistant anymore?

121
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,410
I almost forgot about this.

122
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:52,730
Shaoqing, I think you're absolutely right.

123
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,250
He's not suited to be an assistant.

124
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,690
So now,

125
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,570
he's my driver and bodyguard.

126
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:15,690
Fancy wine parties? Not even filling.

127
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,090
Driver and bodyguard,

128
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:19,690
you're still not full?

129
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,370
That's all what you've got.

130
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,810
How does me eating a sausage bother you?

131
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:25,410
Talking all day long.

132
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,250
Zhao Chuxi,

133
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,610
you made a new friend?

134
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:30,650
I just met a guy, and he's quite interesting.

135
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:31,690
Quite interesting?

136
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,490
You know, he's not as simple as he seems.

137
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:37,290
He's officially an assistant at his company,

138
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,690
but he's actually the one

139
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,810
making all the decisions.

140
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:43,370
Zhao Chuxi,

141
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:45,450
if you can become friends with him,

142
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,010
I'll owe you big time.

143
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,850
Alright, I got it.

144
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,170
Alright?

145
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,930
Alright, Fusheng BBQ.

146
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:53,890
Let's go!

147
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,610
Driver and bodyguard,

148
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,850
you just got your license.

149
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,490
It's time to test your skills.

150
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,930
Just don't press the brake and gas together!

151
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,730
You're always so talkative all day.

152
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:08,530
My driving skills are top-notch now.

153
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:14,610
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

154
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:23,470
I have a few words to say.

155
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,170
First of all,

156
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,250
Lu Yao,

157
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,650
I want to thank you.

158
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,450
Because of you,

159
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:32,930
I found the courage to face my heart.

160
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,450
Absolutely right.

161
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:36,890
Also, without her, you wouldn't drive.

162
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,810
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

163
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,490
- Yeah.
- And also,

164
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,410
I need to thank you, Chuxi.

165
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,650
Ms. Su, no need to be so formal with me.

166
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:44,890
Thank you for coming back.

167
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:47,490
Come on, cheers.

168
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:48,330
Here we go.

169
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:51,210
Cheers!

170
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:52,090
Just go!

171
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,050
Ms. Su,

172
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:04,010
I've always admired you.

173
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:04,850
Why?

174
00:09:05,090 --> 00:09:05,930
You know,

175
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:08,250
you're the one in this world,

176
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,130
aside from my sister,

177
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:13,210
that I admire the most.

178
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:14,050
Wait a second.

179
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:15,810
You have a sister?

180
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,850
She's my adoptive father's daughter.

181
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,930
Is your sister pretty?

182
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,370
Much prettier than you.

183
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,730
You...

184
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,370
Me what?

185
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,890
Is your sister prettier,

186
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,890
or is Ms. Su prettier?

187
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:34,170
Each has their charm.

188
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:36,290
Wrong answer.

189
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:37,610
- Punish you.
- Punish you!

190
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,490
Go ahead.

191
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:41,970
Zhao Chuxi,

192
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,970
you're a good person

193
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:45,410
in every way,

194
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,650
but you have one shortcoming

195
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,210
that you're too honest.

196
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,530
Drink up!

197
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,330
Is being honest bad?

198
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,170
Just drink!

199
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,890
People in the village are all honest.

200
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:56,930
- Come on!
- You're really good at it.

201
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:58,370
I respond really fast.

202
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,330
Faster than you.

203
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,010
Cheers.

204
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:19,900
(Shui She Suite Hotel)

205
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,370
Can you walk by yourself?

206
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:27,530
I...

207
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:28,490
I can't.

208
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,570
My legs feel weak. I can't move.

209
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,030
Let me help you. Come on.

210
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:38,930
Take it slow, okay?

211
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,510
Oh dear, you're quite heavy.

212
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,810
Ms. Su,

213
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,130
is this your friend?

214
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,210
Yes.

215
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,690
Why did he drink so much?

216
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:55,690
Come on, let me help you.

217
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,370
No need.

218
00:10:57,530 --> 00:10:58,370
It's fine.

219
00:10:58,370 --> 00:10:59,410
Don't be polite, buddy.

220
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:01,290
We security guards are really professional.

221
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:03,290
- Come on.
- I don't need you.

222
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,490
I've got Ms. Su.

223
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,050
Ms. Su is just a young lady.

224
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:07,570
Look, you've already overwhelmed her.

225
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:08,520
No need to be so formal.

226
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,890
It's... it's fine.

227
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,410
Come on, buddy.

228
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:13,690
Ms. Su, you go ahead.

229
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,250
Alright.

230
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,730
- I'll get the door.
- Alright then.

231
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,490
Your arm...

232
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,090
Arm... Let's go.

233
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,730
Why are you so clueless?

234
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,930
Can't you figure this out?

235
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,730
People never ruin a marriage.

236
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,170
Don't mess up my plans.

237
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,650
Ms. Su.

238
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:36,170
Ms. Su.

239
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:43,490
Did I ruin a marriage?

240
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,530
This city is indeed full of tricks.

241
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,370
Such a deep scar.

242
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,770
That must've hurt a lot.

243
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:31,530
What are you doing here?

244
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,050
Nothing.

245
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,130
Don't get me wrong.

246
00:12:36,850 --> 00:12:38,650
I bring my brother to you. This is my robe.

247
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,290
No.

248
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,650
My brother asked me to bring you a robe.

249
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:45,290
Your brother?

250
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,530
It's not that.

251
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,290
This is my brother's robe.

252
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:49,810
I... I bring it to you.

253
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:56,090
You get changed first, alright?

254
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,650
Ms. Su,

255
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:12,330
you always keep such a stern face,

256
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,130
isn't that uncomfortable?

257
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,250
You should smile more.

258
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,170
Smiling makes the world a better place.

259
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,690
I'll go prepare your bed.

260
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,790
The sheets and covers have all been changed.

261
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:31,810
They're clean.

262
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,170
Rest easy and sleep well.

263
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,650
Call me if you need anything.

264
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:36,330
Or just send me a message.

265
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:46,650
Go to bed early.

266
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,450
Go to bed early.

267
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,570
Why aren't you asleep yet?

268
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,810
You're not sleeping either.

269
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:56,610
What are you looking at?

270
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,330
You look so good.

271
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:04,410
Do I look good?

272
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:07,690
Great.

273
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,810
Do you like me?

274
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,530
Who wouldn't like you?

275
00:15:25,450 --> 00:15:26,450
You dress like this.

276
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,210
Aren't you afraid I might

277
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,210
take things further?

278
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,650
You're playing with fire here.

279
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,890
Where's my room?

280
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,210
Over there.

281
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:54,090
I'm tired, going to sleep.

282
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,970
Playing with fire?

283
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:10,010
He got the desire but not the guts, huh?

284
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,370
Come here, come here.

285
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,290
What are you hiding for?

286
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:33,170
Hey.

287
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:36,010
I'm awkward to face you.

288
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,810
I almost ruined your big moment last night.

289
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:38,970
You know, huh?

290
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,330
Next time, be more perceptive

291
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,050
and use your brain, got it?

292
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:44,890
Got it.

293
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,610
I spent all night thinking.

294
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:49,890
I was wondering if I ruined ten temples,

295
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,570
or broke up a marriage.

296
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,090
The conclusion is,

297
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,170
I might've messed up your marriage.

298
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,450
It's not that serious.

299
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,890
I pushed you away, didn't I?

300
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,690
Think before you act next time.

301
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,990
Show some emotional intelligence.

302
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,090
- Got it?
- Got it.

303
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:03,970
Where are you from?

304
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:04,810
Hua County.

305
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:07,690
Really? I'm from Wanjing Mountain.

306
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:08,810
Is that so?

307
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:10,050
Are you serious?

308
00:17:10,050 --> 00:17:11,850
It's true. My name is Zhao Chuxi.

309
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:16,250
I might be a few years older than you.

310
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:17,890
I'll call you Zhao from now on.

311
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,050
My name is Zhang Maodun.

312
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,210
Maodun?

313
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,010
Your name doesn't sound right.

314
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,850
It's a contradiction in itself.

315
00:17:24,850 --> 00:17:27,170
My dad came up with this name randomly.

316
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,210
Zhao, to be honest,

317
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,330
I really admire you.

318
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:32,970
Since Ms. Su moved into this neighborhood,

319
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,250
aside from the pesky flies,

320
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,210
no man has ever stepped into her room.

321
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:37,850
Really?

322
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,730
Impressive.

323
00:17:39,330 --> 00:17:40,680
I'll treat you to dinner sometime.

324
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:42,050
You know,

325
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:44,450
keep an eye on Ms. Su for me.

326
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:47,970
I'm currently her assistant and bodyguard.

327
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:49,650
I'm responsible for her safety.

328
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,970
Take more care of her, alright?

329
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:54,010
Got it.

330
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:56,770
Let me leave you a phone number.

331
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:00,330
If there's anything with Ms. Su,

332
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:01,490
I'll call you immediately.

333
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:04,250
Got it.

334
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,570
Zhao, I promise,

335
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:07,850
even if it's a male fly,

336
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,050
it won't get into her room.

337
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:10,490
Okay.

338
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:18,170
You're my idol.

339
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:42,330
Well...

340
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:43,890
Well...

341
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:46,410
The overnight stay...

342
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,770
Are you sure?

343
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:50,330
Yes, I'm sure.

344
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,650
Mr. Xu,

345
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:54,770
I saw Zhao Chuxi left Ms. Su's place

346
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:56,090
this morning.

347
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,730
- Get out.
- Mr. Xu...

348
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,570
Xiluo,

349
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:26,850
I really don't understand you anymore.

350
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:29,810
Don't tell me you're into Zhao Chuxi.

351
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,130
Zhao Chuxi!

352
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:15,530
Guan Yue.

353
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:21,810
Here.

354
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,210
Earlier,

355
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,010
I asked you to investigate Zhao Chuxi.

356
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,530
How's it going?

357
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:28,610
Everything is clear.

358
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,390
Besides working at Ms. Su's company,

359
00:20:30,390 --> 00:20:32,410
Zhao Chuxi is also the security captain

360
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,770
at Langtaosha Bathhouse.

361
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:35,730
That's all?

362
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,330
That's all.

363
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,290
Three things.

364
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:42,290
First,

365
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,650
find someone to clean this up;

366
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,010
second,

367
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:50,530
don't let more people know about this;

368
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,490
third,

369
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,770
you personally lead a team

370
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:58,770
to teach Zhao Chuxi a serious lesson.

371
00:20:59,130 --> 00:20:59,970
Alright.

372
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,370
I'm on it.

373
00:21:36,130 --> 00:21:37,090
Can you do me a favor?

374
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:37,930
Go ahead.

375
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,090
I'm feeling a bit embarrassed.

376
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,130
No need for that. Just say it.

377
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:49,970
My brother asks me if I have a boyfriend.

378
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,450
He keeps asking and I feel annoying.

379
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:53,730
I said I do.

380
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,930
That's what I'm thinking.

381
00:21:56,290 --> 00:21:57,610
Once his school starts,

382
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,290
come with me to meet him, okay?

383
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,490
Want me to pretend to be your boyfriend?

384
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,850
Alright, I agree.

385
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:08,210
But the specific details,

386
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,330
like family situation, tell me clearly,

387
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,490
to avoid making a mistake later.

388
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:16,130
Thank you, Chuxi.

389
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:17,490
Why so polite with me?

390
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:20,810
Look at this snow.

391
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,390
Come on.

392
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:27,260
Cheers.

393
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:38,130
Sanqiang.

394
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:40,530
Can you get me a car?

395
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,530
I already have one.

396
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:42,530
My van.

397
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,580
Here.

398
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:46,410
To get a more fancy car.

399
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,770
You know, one that looks impressive.

400
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,530
What do you need it for?

401
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:53,250
Just helping Qin Ran.

402
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:54,130
Oh my gosh.

403
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:56,370
Chuxi, something's going on with you, huh?

404
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,690
Nothing is going on.

405
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,490
Her family's press her to get married.

406
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:03,090
I'm just pretending to be her boyfriend
to deal with her brother.

407
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,970
Pretend?

408
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,410
What? Why are you pretending?

409
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,490
Why not just make it real?

410
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,970
Exactly, why bother pretending?

411
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:15,890
Don't talk nonsense.

412
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,170
She's a decent young lady.

413
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:19,410
We have a pure friendship.

414
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:22,050
- Pure friendship?
- Pure, you say?

415
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,290
A pure friendship.

416
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,450
Here's to friendship!

417
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,290
Be serious.

418
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,370
Cheers to friendship!

419
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:28,450
It's pure.

420
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,490
It's a serious matter.

421
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:34,130
No problem.

422
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,450
I'll take care of the car.

423
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,530
Don't you need a driver?

424
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:42,170
Don't you need a bodyguard?

425
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,370
Forget it.

426
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,650
You're scaring her.

427
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:47,570
What are you talking about?

428
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:48,850
Actually,

429
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,370
it's just to show off.

430
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:53,290
One driver, one bodyguard.

431
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:55,490
That will be absolutely impressive.

432
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,330
Yeah.

433
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:57,410
Correct.

434
00:23:58,570 --> 00:23:59,410
Erpang,

435
00:23:59,690 --> 00:24:01,290
you have to learn from Chuxi.

436
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,450
Look at how considerate

437
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:06,490
he is towards a girl.

438
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,050
You really should learn.

439
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,170
- Absolutely.
- Learn it.

440
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,350
Don't make fun of me anymore.

441
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:11,770
- Hurry up.
- Learn from him.

442
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,650
Here, I propose a toast to you, Chuxi.

443
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,530
Why this toast, though?

444
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,970
Is it for friendship or for status?

445
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,650
For the status of friendship.

446
00:24:21,650 --> 00:24:22,650
Drink it.

447
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:23,690
Come on, come on.

448
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,210
How's that? Feel proud yet?

449
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,650
Sure.

450
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,370
Whose car?

451
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:24,370
Sanqiang handled it.

452
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:26,250
Today, I'm the professional driver.

453
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:27,930
Today, I'm the personal bodyguard.

454
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,730
I've arranged everything for later.

455
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:33,250
Isn't this a bit too flashy?

456
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:34,730
My brother doesn't believe it.

457
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:37,610
No way, I'm a big boss now.

458
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,050
Making it too plain wouldn't convince him.

459
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,010
Alright.

460
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,130
- Mr. Zhao, please.
- Mr. Zhao, please.

461
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,730
Ying, right?

462
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:57,890
Bro.

463
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,250
You've grown so tall.

464
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:01,850
But you're way too thin.

465
00:26:02,130 --> 00:26:03,530
You need to focus on nutrition.

466
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:05,850
It's my place.

467
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:07,410
You can eat whatever you want.

468
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,250
Beer or liquor?

469
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,370
He's a kid.

470
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,410
Let's get some beer then.

471
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,250
Sure, bro.

472
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,210
Then let's go with some beer.

473
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,530
A pack of beer.

474
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,370
Got it!

475
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:20,370
Sis,

476
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:21,730
are you sure

477
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:22,970
this is your boyfriend?

478
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:24,490
Well...

479
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:27,130
How could this be fake?

480
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:28,610
This is nothing

481
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,410
like what I imagined.

482
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:32,490
Is it higher

483
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,370
or lower

484
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,530
than expected?

485
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,090
It's definitely higher!

486
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,330
See, Ying knows what to say.

487
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,410
I like it.

488
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,930
I'll give you a big red envelope later.

489
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:44,170
Learn from Chuxi.

490
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:46,930
Watch how he handles the conversation.

491
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:49,890
You'll treat your girlfriend like that later.

492
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:52,370
Why would I need that?

493
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,150
Why don't you get yourself a girlfriend?

494
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,170
I'd love to, but I need one first.

495
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:59,170
Bro, what line of work are you in?

496
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:01,250
During New Year, I asked my sister,

497
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,410
but she didn't say a word.

498
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:04,490
I've been holding back until now.

499
00:27:05,530 --> 00:27:06,570
Real estate.

500
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,050
People in real estate are always rich.

501
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,510
Private enterprise or state-owned one?

502
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,290
Private enterprise.

503
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,010
Luoshen Group.

504
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:16,930
Do you know about it?

505
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,290
I've heard of it.

506
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:21,570
These year, the group's branch...

507
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,370
Whose car is parked at the entrance? Move it.

508
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:27,970
The car.

509
00:27:27,970 --> 00:27:29,610
Mine, it's mine.

510
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:30,930
The car is mine.

511
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:34,650
These years, the company's business

512
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,490
has been expanding into Jia City.

513
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,490
Do you know the International Mansion?

514
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:41,410
That's actually managed by our group.

515
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:42,530
Over there...

516
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,010
You're asking too much.

517
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:45,930
Don't worry.

518
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:51,650
I came here under the order of our parents.

519
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:52,930
You're already at this age,

520
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,410
and you still don't have a boyfriend.

521
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,010
They're also concerned.

522
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,410
- Here.
- Ying's got a point.

523
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,170
She finally got a boyfriend.

524
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,810
I had to come over to check things out.

525
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:02,690
Come on, bro.

526
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:08,450
Bro, I'll make a toast to you.

527
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,290
No way.

528
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:11,170
As the elder, I should fill my glass.

529
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:15,570
- Cheers, Ying.
- Cheers, bro.

530
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,410
Bottoms up.

531
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:22,450
What about me?

532
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:24,690
Here, let me.

533
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,330
Sis.

534
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:33,130
Are you taking the bus back or a taxi?

535
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,570
Look. His driver is picking us up.

536
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:37,930
Hello.

537
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:40,770
Qin Ying.

538
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:45,090
How about having my driver take you back?

539
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:45,970
No, no need.

540
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:48,090
Taking the bus back is fine for me.

541
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:53,490
Alright.

542
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:56,330
I let my driver send your sister home first.

543
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:58,730
Sis.

544
00:28:58,810 --> 00:28:59,650
Bro.

545
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,130
I'll head back now.

546
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,450
- Alright.
- Alright.

547
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,210
Take care.

548
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,650
Take care, Qin Ying.

549
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,570
What should we do now?

550
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,410
Head back to work.

551
00:29:18,170 --> 00:29:19,890
Work is so boring.

552
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,050
How long can we borrow this car?

553
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,090
Until tomorrow.

554
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:29,650
I want to drive too.

555
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,130
Then let's go.

556
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,850
Let's take a drive.

557
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,570
Mr. Guan, we've remembered what you said.

558
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:46,650
Go ahead.

559
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:49,250
Be mindful of your actions.

560
00:29:56,820 --> 00:30:00,980
(Langtaosha Business Club)

561
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,530
Sir, please check the water temperature

562
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:03,450
and see if it's hot.

563
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,250
Are you trying to burn me?

564
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,470
What kind of service is this?

565
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,490
Apologies, sir.

566
00:30:07,490 --> 00:30:08,890
What are you staring at? Hurry up!

567
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,530
- Could you blow-dry for me?
- Sir.

568
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,830
Serve me well and I'll let it go.

569
00:30:16,830 --> 00:30:17,730
Sir, show some respect.

570
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,330
Sir, please.

571
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:20,790
What are you pretending for?

572
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,850
- Sir, don't do this!
- Help! Help!

573
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:24,370
- Come here!
- Someone help!

574
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,650
Mao, help!

575
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:26,490
Sir!

576
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,770
Mao!

577
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:29,610
Sir! Sir!

578
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,690
Don't get handsy.

579
00:30:31,690 --> 00:30:33,090
It's a legitimate business.

580
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:35,410
What if I do get handsy?

581
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,130
Could you both step outside with me?

582
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:38,970
Alright?

583
00:30:45,930 --> 00:30:47,250
We're out here. What's the matter?

584
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:54,770
Zhao.

585
00:30:56,770 --> 00:30:57,690
Are you okay?

586
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:58,530
I'm fine.

587
00:31:01,010 --> 00:31:03,370
There's no need for this tension, right?

588
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,410
So many people.

589
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,250
Let me count.

590
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:11,050
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.

591
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:13,530
What, trying to threaten me?

592
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:14,850
Not possible.

593
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:17,650
We're in the service industry.

594
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,530
- You look respectable.
- Are you okay?

595
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:20,410
How about this?

596
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:22,090
If you're not satisfied,

597
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,730
I'll cover the bill today, alright?

598
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,010
Please, calm down.

599
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,330
No, I can't.

600
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,250
Do you see the surveillance footage?

601
00:31:40,410 --> 00:31:41,890
How about I call the police now?

602
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,730
Let the officers come over

603
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,410
and help you calm down.

604
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:51,930
You're ruthless.

605
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:53,450
We'll just wait and see.

606
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,210
Are you two okay?

607
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:05,170
We're fine.

608
00:32:05,330 --> 00:32:06,410
You two head back now.

609
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,970
Take the day off from work.

610
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:09,570
Go home and get some rest.

611
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:11,130
It's really nothing.

612
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:12,450
Listen to me. Go back and rest.

613
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,250
What exactly happened?

614
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,090
I don't know.

615
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,410
They stirred trouble on purpose.

616
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,330
See you, sir.

617
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,650
Sir,

618
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:35,170
Zhao Chuxi is finishing work early tonight.

619
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,590
He must pass through Xiaokang Alley.

620
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:39,610
Got it.

621
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:41,450
Don't worry, sir.

622
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:42,930
I've already taken care of everything.

623
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,370
I reassigned all of Zhao Chuxi's men.

624
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,850
No one will help him tonight.

625
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,130
Take care.

626
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,450
- We're going.
- Take care.

627
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,490
Zhao Chuxi,

628
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,530
let's see how you'll handle this.

629
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:02,290
Captain Qiao, what are you looking?

630
00:33:03,210 --> 00:33:04,050
Where have you been?

631
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,170
I'm heading to the restroom.

632
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,530
Why do you need to go so often?

633
00:33:07,530 --> 00:33:08,770
Nature calls, you know.

634
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:16,710
Take care, Captain Qiao.

635
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,780
(Langtaosha Business Club)

636
00:33:27,250 --> 00:33:28,130
See you, Zhao.

637
00:33:28,450 --> 00:33:29,290
Bye.

638
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:30,510
Zhao! Zhao!

639
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,890
Teach me how to do this.

640
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,290
After you leave, I can practice.

641
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,890
Not today, feeling a bit tired.

642
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,330
Can't handle it today.

643
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,850
I'll teach you another day.

644
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:39,890
Uh...

645
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,090
Take care.

646
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,250
Yeah.

647
00:33:42,250 --> 00:33:43,250
Stay safe.

648
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,010
I'm in.

649
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:51,450
Two Qs.

650
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:53,130
Two Jokers.

651
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,050
Go ahead, then.

652
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,290
I can't. Just go.

653
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,490
- Hello? Chuxi.
- Erpang,

654
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,010
I'm off work now.

655
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,410
Call Sanqiang and let's grab breakfast.

656
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:02,330
Sounds good.

657
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,930
Qiang and I will join you soon.

658
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:04,810
