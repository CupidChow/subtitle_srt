=My Name is Zhao Chuxi=

00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,180
=Episode 25=

3
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,870
Distinguished leaders and guests,

4
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,820
welcome, everyone.

5
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,030
Thank you for attending,

6
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,000
(Signing Ceremony Reception)
the signing ceremony reception

7
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,740
of Sanjiang Group.

8
00:01:28,070 --> 00:01:28,980
As we all know,

9
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,670
Sanjiang Group, in recent years,

10
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:32,740
has faced numerous challenges and obstacles

11
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:34,620
during its journey of development.

12
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:37,670
Fortunately, with the support

13
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,150
of leaders and colleagues,

14
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,100
Sanjiang Group has actively responded

15
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,710
to Jia City's leadership's call.

16
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:46,740
We have worked diligently and forged ahead,

17
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,510
creating today's

18
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:50,950
new landscape and outlook for Sanjiang Group.

19
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,100
Now, allow me to proudly introduce

20
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,180
the chairman of Sanjiang Group,

21
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,230
Mr. Zhao Chuxi.

22
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,700
Alright, I hereby announce,

23
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,670
the signing ceremony between Sanjiang Group

24
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,780
(Xu Lin)
and Jinmao Group officially begins.

25
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,740
(Signing Ceremony Reception)

26
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:54,550
Great!

27
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,430
Keep moving forward.

28
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,180
(Three months later, Bei City)

29
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:38,830
Lu Yao.

30
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:41,590
You came to Bei City, so I must pick you up.

31
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,340
Who are you?

32
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,430
It's me.

33
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,620
I'm Erpang.

34
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,310
Erpang?

35
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,460
What's with your look?

36
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,780
How did you lose so much weight?

37
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:54,740
Don't you like the handsome guy Kang Ta

38
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:57,830
in that HOT idol group?

39
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,500
I lost weight and got a perm too.

40
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,030
So? Pretty cool, huh?

41
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,310
♪This clueless version of me♪

42
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,430
♪Maybe a little timid♪

43
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:12,550
♪Letting you choose to escape♪

44
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,710
♪Perhaps that's not wrong♪

45
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,220
- ♪Forget everything♪
- Okay, okay.

46
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:17,950
You don't look like Kang Ta.

47
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,600
Feels like someone's holding your throat.

48
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,630
I came here. Don't you treat me?

49
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,320
Sure, what do you want to eat? I'll take you.

50
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,150
Alright, after we eat,

51
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,030
fix that hairstyle of yours.

52
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,950
My hairstyle isn't cool?

53
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,340
This perm cost me a fortune, you know.

54
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,030
Sis,

55
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,780
why did you bring me here?

56
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,880
Do you still remember when we were kids,

57
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,150
you always carried a wooden board

58
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,590
and ski on the snow?

59
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,430
I remember.

60
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,750
Snow at Wanjing Mountain lasted half a year.

61
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,010
The heavy snow sealed off the mountain.

62
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:14,460
There was really nothing fun.

63
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,540
Plus, the elderly and kids can't go out.

64
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,030
Even getting medical help is so hard.

65
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,950
But in Switzerland, it snows heavily too.

66
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,510
Yet they have ski resorts for entertainment.

67
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,510
Once all of this is over,

68
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,950
let's head back to Wanjing Mountain

69
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:30,180
and set up a ski resort there.

70
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,630
We can't let snow be a hindrance to life.

71
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,070
It should be a playground for kids to enjoy.

72
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,390
You're really on the same page as me.

73
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,630
Take a look at this snowboard.

74
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,340
There's only one like it in the country.

75
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,780
I got it for you. What do you think?

76
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,780
This is the gift you wanted to give me?

77
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,070
The real gift is still on its way.

78
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,860
This is such an incredible coincidence.

79
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,750
But no matter how much I think,

80
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,060
I never expected to run into you here.

81
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:23,950
You even have such a hobby like skiing.

82
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:25,870
Mr. Xu,

83
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:27,780
long time no see.

84
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,510
Seeing you makes me so happy.

85
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,710
Alright, Zhao Chuxi,

86
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,830
I can tell

87
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,270
you've been doing well these years.

88
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,750
I'm really surprised.

89
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,060
Mr. Xu,

90
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:53,710
thanks to your support,

91
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,070
I'm still alive.

92
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,100
And luck has been on my side.

93
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,660
But you don't look great.

94
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:02,750
Working too hard without proper rest, huh?

95
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,830
Hope you won't lose sleep because of me.

96
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,780
Zhao Chuxi, Zhao Chuxi,

97
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,780
you've really outdone yourself.

98
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,150
The tension's thick right from the start.

99
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,340
But that's not a bad thing.

100
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:18,700
It's just waste utilization.

101
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:21,100
But no matter how it is used,

102
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,150
waste is still waste.

103
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,460
Without depth, how far can you really go?

104
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,730
If you want to play, fine.

105
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,340
I'll be waiting for you.

106
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,670
Besides,

107
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,660
even if you don't come to me,

108
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,220
I'll go look for you too.

109
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,670
Mr. Xu,

110
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,540
I'll say it again.

111
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,510
Always at your service.

112
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,060
Alright.

113
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,950
After all, we're at least friends.

114
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,460
Aren't you going to introduce her?

115
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,550
Your sister?

116
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,710
Mr. Xu, right?

117
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:02,060
Nice to meet you.

118
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,420
I'm Chuxi's fiancée.

119
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,550
Well...

120
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,470
Well...

121
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,460
So, you're engaged too?

122
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,220
Congratulations, congratulations!

123
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:21,980
Your fiancée is not only beautiful,

124
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,440
but she also has great taste.

125
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,830
You're familiar with my fiancée, right?

126
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,150
Xiluo, come meet an old friend.

127
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,990
Xiluo, why are you spacing out?

128
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:50,750
Come over and meet Chuxi.

129
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,230
Come on.

130
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:55,950
Here, come on.

131
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,620
Here.

132
00:08:59,230 --> 00:09:00,750
Do you still remember Zhao Chuxi?

133
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,510
He used to work at your construction site.

134
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,420
Later, he even worked as your driver.

135
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,580
That Zhao Chuxi.

136
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,780
Say hello, come on.

137
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,260
Come on, say hello.

138
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,350
Long time no see.

139
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,070
Ms. Su.

140
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,580
It's been years.

141
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,390
You've become even more poised.

142
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,750
So when are you marrying Mr. Xu?

143
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,270
If I'm not too busy,

144
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,110
I'd love to attend your wedding.

145
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:28,630
You won't leave me out, right?

146
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,940
Of course not.

147
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,230
We're old friends.

148
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,780
I'd be thrilled if you came to our wedding.

149
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:42,960
Xiluo,

150
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,870
did Zhao Chuxi

151
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,060
do something amazing in his past life?

152
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,900
He actually got such a gorgeous girlfriend.

153
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,300
If you two are free,

154
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,760
you can come to our wedding too.

155
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,270
We'd love to have you there.

156
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,870
Right, Chuxi?

157
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,990
Right.

158
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,900
See how great she is!

159
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,700
So polite and thoughtful.

160
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:07,150
As long as you welcome me,
I'll definitely be there.

161
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,780
Not only will I attend,

162
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,630
I still need to prepare a big gift for you.

163
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,950
I'm really looking forward to it.

164
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,020
Let's go.

165
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,630
Alright, let's leave it here for today.

166
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,420
I believe it won't be long

167
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,470
before we meet again.

168
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,350
We'll have a proper chat then.

169
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,660
Always at your service, Mr. Xu.

170
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,500
Were you referring to that one earlier?

171
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,820
Is that right?

172
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,230
I want it.

173
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,180
Excuse me. Come over here.

174
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,470
Is the one you have on display

175
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,660
the only limited edition in the country?

176
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:42,870
Yes, sir.

177
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,370
Wrap it up for me. I'll take it.

178
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,390
Sorry.

179
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,030
But we've already reserved that board.

180
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,900
Wait, what did you just say?

181
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,030
We'll let it go. Thank you.

182
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,870
No, no, no.

183
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,510
Zhao Chuxi,

184
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,660
you still love taking things, huh?

185
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,700
Before, you took my woman, but failed.

186
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,510
It's just the truth.

187
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,660
Do you think you can take that board from me?

188
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,500
Stop messing around.

189
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,180
I don't know.

190
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,500
Give it a try.

191
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,830
Fine.

192
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,310
Let's give it a try then.

193
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,620
Excuse me.

194
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,150
Call the manager, Zhang, over for me.

195
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,300
Tell her that I want that board.

196
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:22,470
Got it, Mr. Zhao.

197
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,270
Hello, Mr. Zhao.

198
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,510
I'll wrap up the board for you right away.

199
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,350
Hold on.

200
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,180
What do you mean?

201
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,900
I said I wanted it first just now.

202
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,750
Didn't you hear me?

203
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,660
Sorry, sir.

204
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,510
This board already belongs to Mr. Zhao.

205
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:45,390
Do you know who I am?

206
00:11:45,990 --> 00:11:47,300
I don't know who you are.

207
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,750
But I know this shop

208
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:52,030
is one of Mr. Zhao's business ventures.

209
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:57,990
Alright, thank you.

210
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,390
We're not buying it. Let's go.

211
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:00,780
No wonder

212
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,390
I haven't found anything I want to buy.

213
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,510
Let me tell you.

214
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:06,150
This lousy shop, I...

215
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,470
Don't pull me.

216
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,020
Zhao Chuxi,

217
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,300
don't celebrate too soon.

218
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:11,500
Just wait.

219
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,350
Feeling good now?

220
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,750
Yep, super happy.

221
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,270
This board looks pretty nice!

222
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,270
A one-of-a-kind piece.

223
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,470
I truly love it.

224
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,780
The painting's quite good.

225
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,350
A bit of Picasso and Fauvism in it.

226
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,180
Can you truly appreciate it?

227
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,420
Of course I can.

228
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:40,900
Have you decided where to try it out?

229
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,060
- Wanjing Mountain.
- Wanjing Mountain.

230
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,990
I'm feeling a bit tired tonight.

231
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:48,540
I skip dinner. Don't wait for me.

232
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,630
I need to talk to you.

233
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,420
Xu Shaoqing, I told you I'm exhausted.

234
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,510
Xu Shaoqing, are you crazy?

235
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,990
I've tolerated you for far too long!

236
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:08,540
I thought you'd forgotten him by now.

237
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,180
But after you met him again today,

238
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,540
you're still acting the same way.

239
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,750
Xiluo, let me ask you this.

240
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,540
Haven't I treated you well?

241
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:19,820
I've chased after you for so long.

242
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:21,900
I did everything as you wished.

243
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,030
I've supported you in work and life.

244
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,150
And what about you?

245
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:28,350
You made me lose face in front of a loser.

246
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,270
Do you think I'm easygoing?

247
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,390
Do you take me for a fool?

248
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,030
Who does Zhao Chuxi think he is?

249
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,510
He dared to show off in front of me.

250
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,540
Let me tell you this.

251
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,030
I, Xu Shaoqing,

252
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,390
am not someone to be trampled on.

253
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:52,230
Tell me.

254
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,360
What do you want to do?

255
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,230
What exactly are you after?

256
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,180
I, Xu Shaoqing,

257
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,990
haven't done enough for you, huh?

258
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:05,750
Answer me.

259
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,820
Done venting?

260
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,990
Can you leave now?

261
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,580
Trying to kick me out, huh?

262
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,660
You want me to leave, right?

263
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,630
You're starting

264
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,270
to kick me out, huh?

265
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:39,150
How dare you!

266
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:45,950
What happened?

267
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,140
You hit your head?

268
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,700
Are you okay?

269
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,580
Here...

270
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,060
Sorry, I'm really sorry!

271
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,060
I didn't mean to do it.

272
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,350
Alright.

273
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,420
Why do you always act like this?

274
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:58,230
I've told you before.

275
00:14:58,540 --> 00:14:59,990
I have my limits.

276
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,700
Why do you keep pushing me?

277
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,700
You've really made me angry.

278
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,580
I don't even know what I might do.

279
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,900
Don't forget

280
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,750
Luoshen Group has three projects in Jia City.

281
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,820
As long as I say one word,

282
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,350
they will come to a halt.

283
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,700
How severe would the consequences be?

284
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,720
You know that better than I do.

285
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,660
Don't push me too far.

286
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,990
This is the last time.

287
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,300
There can't be a next time.

288
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:32,900
Otherwise,

289
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,470
that Xu Shaoqing you see then

290
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:37,660
won't be this Xu Shaoqing you know now.

291
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,750
Remember your position.

292
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,900
You are the fiancée

293
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:46,780
of me, Xu Shaoqing.

294
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:07,990
Alright,

295
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:09,990
tidy yourself up

296
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,270
and get some rest early.

297
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:28,030
Mr. Zhao,

298
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,430
as the chairman of Sanjiang Group,

299
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,620
you're still using this phone?

300
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,430
I'll get you a premium phone this afternoon.

301
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,240
I'm staying true to the original intention.

302
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,380
Xu,

303
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,350
let's talk about something serious.

304
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,820
Guess who I just ran into.

305
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,430
Who?

306
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,190
Su Xiluo and Xu Shaoqing.

307
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,340
I thought you'd meet them in Jia City.

308
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,910
Didn't expect to see them so soon.

309
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,640
So, how do you plan to handle this?

310
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,640
I don't plan to handle it for now.

311
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:00,620
Su Xiluo

312
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,950
is definitely not doing well.

313
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:02,990
She seems conflicted.

314
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
I'm aware of that.

315
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,710
Xu Shaoqing seemed a bit unsettled to see me.

316
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,750
He probably thinks I'm a threat to him.

317
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,380
I bet he's investigating my background.

318
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:16,380
It'll take him a while to find anything.

319
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,140
How's the situation with Luoshen Group?

320
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:25,060
Luoshen's financial chain is stretched thin.

321
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,950
The cooperation projects with our group

322
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,470
are all of considerable scale.

323
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,060
Su Qin signed many agreements with us

324
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,950
behind the back of Su Xiluo.

325
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:35,470
If we halt the projects now,

326
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,990
Luoshen Group will declare bankruptcy.

327
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,350
Brilliant!

328
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:42,380
We're close to returning to Jia City.

329
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,100
Get a new phone this afternoon.

330
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,580
No way.

331
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,670
Haven't you been busy lately?

332
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,340
I'll go back with you.

333
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,620
Let's go.

334
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,980
(Jia City)

335
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,460
(Jia City Branch of Sanjiang Group)
Qingyi.

336
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,310
Erpang,

337
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,710
when did you get back?

338
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,270
I just arrived.

339
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:50,980
Chuxi,

340
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,580
I have something to tell you.

341
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:53,670
Take a seat. Go ahead.

342
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,700
What happened?

343
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,620
Why are you hesitating like that?

344
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,460
Just say it.

345
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,230
My uncle has agreed to join Sanjiang Group.

346
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:12,580
I've passed the test my uncle set for me.

347
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,140
Now, I'm the heir of the Lin's Group.

348
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:19,540
So, Lin's Group is officially
investing in Sanjiang Group.

349
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:24,550
That's fantastic!

350
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,510
This gives us another strong card to play.

351
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:30,780
When the time is right,

352
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,540
I'll announce something even more important.

353
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:37,300
So, you are keeping secrets from me today?

354
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:40,100
Alright, I'm hungry.

355
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:41,460
Let's go eat.

356
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,620
- Let's eat.
- Let's go.

357
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,230
What should we eat?

358
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:48,380
Fusheng BBQ.

359
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,300
(Fusheng BBQ)

360
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,140
He.

361
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,420
Erpang.

362
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,860
Look who's here.

363
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,990
I, Zhao Chuxi, come back.

364
00:20:58,100 --> 00:20:58,950
It's really you.

365
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:00,940
How's it?

366
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,950
You look sharp and proper.

367
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,040
Quick, have a seat!

368
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,470
I'll get something delicious for you.

369
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,270
- Alright.
- Okay.

370
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:25,620
Chuxi,

371
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,470
is this the barbecue shop you often visited

372
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:28,830
when you first arrived in Jia City?

373
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,710
That's right.

374
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,010
There's also a spicy hot pot place.

375
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,100
I'll take you there next time to try it out.

376
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:38,140
That's the specialties he mentioned

377
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,280
we haven't tasted yet.

378
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,780
It really is quite special.

379
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,060
Very special.

380
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,180
Come on.

381
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,340
Let's raise a toast to the days

382
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,620
and the ups and downs we've been through.

383
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,750
- Come on!
- Cheers!

384
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,910
- Come on!
- Cheers!

385
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,190
Look at you devouring like that.

386
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,190
This is what I told you. It's delicious.

387
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,300
Already satisfied, huh?

388
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,340
Yeah, satisfied!

389
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,860
I've waited for years. I'm back finally.

390
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,300
Of course I'm satisfied.

391
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,620
Today, we're finally back together.

392
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,030
Let's celebrate properly.

393
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,580
Eat well, drink well.

394
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,990
- Alright?
- Cheers!

395
00:22:20,990 --> 00:22:22,380
- Come on.
- Come on.

396
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,990
Tonight, let's forget everything else.

397
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:25,750
- Drink up!
- Let's enjoy tonight!

398
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,430
This time I come back,

399
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,300
it feels like I have everything.

400
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:37,230
Yet it feels like I have nothing.

401
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,430
Because times change, and people do too.

402
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,940
Everyone,

403
00:22:44,470 --> 00:22:45,310
tomorrow,

404
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,270
go with me to visit Sanqiang's grave.

405
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,510
Alright.

406
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:49,940
Let's go.

407
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,530
- Go home.
- Go home.

408
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,870
- Go home.
- Go home.

409
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,190
Feel free to sit anywhere.

410
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,780
I've lived

411
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:18,780
at this home for half my life.

412
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,750
I really can't bear to leave.

413
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,620
Chuxi,

414
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,340
after I'm gone,

415
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,030
take care of Sanwu for me.

416
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,580
Don't let him suffer.

417
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,620
Qingyi, you can stay in Granny's room.

418
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,430
Erpang and I will take his room.

419
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,100
Erpang won't mind, right?

420
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:45,870
Not at all.

421
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:47,340
You stay in Granny's room.

422
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,910
Granny would be so happy if she were here.

423
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,380
Alright.

424
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,110
Wait, something's off.

425
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,510
Hasn't someone been cleaning this place?

426
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,790
- Yeah.
- Who is it?

427
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:07,140
Don't worry about it.

428
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,030
I don't worry?

429
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,780
Are you

430
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,750
keeping secrets from me?

431
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:15,870
No, nothing.

432
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,750
It's just that girl named Lu Yao.

433
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:23,100
You and Lu Yao...

434
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,430
Nothing between us.

435
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,380
Why didn't I know about this?

436
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,470
To be precise,

437
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,140
the whole world knows, except you.

438
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:34,900
What?

439
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,190
Erpang said

440
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,820
you've got a big mouth and love gossip.

441
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,340
If anything happens, don't tell you.

442
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:46,700
Erpang,

443
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,950
look at my tiny lips. You think

444
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:50,380
I love gossip, huh?

445
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,780
Alright, I'm off to bed.

446
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,540
Stop making fun of him.

447
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:57,510
Alright, alright.

448
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,780
I need to talk to you.

449
00:24:59,230 --> 00:25:00,070
Go ahead, sis.

450
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,990
Now that you're back,

451
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,860
what's your plan?

452
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:10,030
Zhou Bin and Xu Shaoqing

453
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,300
are just the appetizers.

454
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,100
Next up

455
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:16,860
is Zhang Shengbai.

456
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,030
Exactly.

457
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:19,430
The time has come.

458
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,470
Zhang Shengbai

459
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,780
won't be easy to handle.

460
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:29,540
But I have you and Erpang, right?

461
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,690
Me?

462
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,230
Sis, after all these years,

463
00:25:33,470 --> 00:25:35,140
it's finally my turn

464
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,910
to step up as the player.

465
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,900
Alright,

466
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,310
I'll be waiting.

467
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,700
(My beloved son Han Sanqiang's grave)

468
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:11,550
Sanqiang,

469
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:12,990
I'm back.

470
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:39,190
Sorry, bro,

471
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,950
it took me so long to visit you.

472
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,270
Why didn't you come find me?

473
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,620
You didn't tell me you were sick,

474
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,670
and then you left so suddenly.

475
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:54,780
Guess what I brought for you.

476
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,140
Your favorite liquor.

477
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,410
Here's a toast to you.

478
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:12,710
In the next life, let's still be brothers,

479
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,230
drinking together,

480
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,780
sharing meals together.

481
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:26,660
Qiang,

482
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:27,950
I toast you.

483
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,380
Bro,

484
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:43,430
when I have free time,

485
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:44,990
I'll come drink with you.

486
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,110
Qiang,

487
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,620
I miss you.

488
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,700
Erpang,

489
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:00,190
Qiang

490
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:02,300
definitely wouldn't want to see us sad.

491
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,830
Qiang,

492
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,950
we are doing well here.

493
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,820
I, Zhao Chuxi,

494
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,430
am now the chairman.

495
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,860
Chairman of Sanjiang Group.

496
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:19,420
Impressive, right?

497
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,300
Erpang has also returned

498
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,290
to take over the family business.

499
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:27,620
Turns out Erpang is a rich heir.

500
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,670
You even bullied him back then,

501
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,990
only paying him 900 yuan a month.

502
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:37,430
If you knew now, you'd regret it.

503
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,990
And your brother,

504
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,550
Zhang Kaishan

505
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:47,820
became a contractor too, just like you.

506
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,580
But he moved to the south.

507
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,300
He said he won't come back

508
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,380
and Jia City is his heartbreak.

509
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:00,550
That guy

510
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,510
won't even visit you.
