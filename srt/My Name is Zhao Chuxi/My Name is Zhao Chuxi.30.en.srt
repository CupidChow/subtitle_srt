=Episode 30=

3
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:09,670
I won't beg for your forgiveness now.

4
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:13,060
But Zhao Chuxi,

5
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:17,230
I implore you to spare Zhang's Group.

6
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,700
It's the work of my entire life.

7
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,420
Zhao Chuxi,

8
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,590
I'm begging you.

9
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,620
This is my final request.

10
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,030
Please save Zhang's Group.

11
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,080
No matter what happens after this,

12
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,420
I can give you anything you want.

13
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:42,950
I'll cooperate with whatever you decide.

14
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,590
I promise you.

15
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,180
What?

16
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,380
I promise you.

17
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,230
Are you serious about this?

18
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,150
Yes, I am.

19
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:04,420
But you have to meet one condition.

20
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:09,260
You took Zhang's Group from my father.

21
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,860
You need to issue a statement

22
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,740
clearing up everything

23
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,470
that happened before

24
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,430
and then return my dad's shares.

25
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:20,350
That's all.

26
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,430
That's it?

27
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,140
Yes, that's all.

28
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,110
Why?

29
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:29,860
If you understood this,

30
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,910
you wouldn't have lost today.

31
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,380
Let's go, Qingyi.

32
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:06,900
Look.

33
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:09,730
(Share Transfer Agreement)
It's the agreement signed by Zhang Shengbai.

34
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,590
I've reviewed it. There are no issues.

35
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,140
You take another look.

36
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,440
(Share Distribution Cooperation Agreement)

37
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,500
(Zhang Shengbai)

38
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,740
To be honest,

39
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,590
I've thought about these documents

40
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,730
on my mind again and again.

41
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,390
And now, looking back on them,

42
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:33,420
everything feels so unreal.

43
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,470
We actually made it.

44
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,190
Chuxi, I believed in you from the start.

45
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,390
I never doubted it.

46
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,590
Erpang, Xu Lin,

47
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,630
thank you both.

48
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:46,300
Without you two,

49
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,390
I wouldn't be here today.

50
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,740
No need to thank us.

51
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:53,500
We've seen everything you've done.

52
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,910
You deserve this.

53
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,340
(Share Transfer Agreement)

54
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,670
I just received some news.

55
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:20,980
Zhang Shengbai

56
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,270
has passed away.

57
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,740
Son,

58
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,180
are you here?

59
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,110
Dad, what's wrong?

60
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,180
It was my fault.

61
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,540
I wasn't a good father.

62
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,380
Are you willing

63
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,350
to forgive me?

64
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,060
Dad, what's wrong with you?

65
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,180
Son,

66
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,150
don't follow my old path again.

67
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:12,740
Dad, what's wrong with you?

68
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,030
Dad, what's wrong with you?

69
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,150
Dad, what's wrong with you?

70
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,790
Are you unwilling to forgive me?

71
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,420
Zhang Shengbai

72
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,140
has passed away.

73
00:05:55,070 --> 00:05:58,910
He left the group's shares and assets

74
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,470
all to Zhao Chuxi.

75
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,030
Why is it always Zhao Chuxi?

76
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,180
I am your biological son.

77
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,110
I am your real hope.

78
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,590
I am the continuation of your legacy.

79
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,470
Zhao Chuxi carries the Zhao family name.

80
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,180
He is not part of the Zhang family.

81
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:25,180
Have you lost your mind, father?

82
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,700
Exactly.

83
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:34,380
My last name isn't Zhang.

84
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,740
My last name is Xu.

85
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,230
The cue rack.

86
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,430
Do you know how to set the balls?

87
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,110
You totally ruined the mood.

88
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,900
I'm a bit short on cash lately.

89
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,270
Bring 2,000 yuan tomorrow.

90
00:07:20,270 --> 00:07:21,670
I don't have that much money.

91
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:23,420
You don't have that much.

92
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,380
If you don't, I'll find a way.

93
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,980
Ask your dad.

94
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,460
Come in.

95
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,580
Shaoqing,

96
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,670
what happened to your face?

97
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,860
I need to borrow 2,000 yuan.

98
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,590
Bring these people who bullied him

99
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:52,790
and their parents, too.

100
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,980
Show me exactly

101
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,070
how you bullied Xu Shaoqing.

102
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,270
We were playing pool at the billiards hall.

103
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,060
My friend kicked him

104
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,510
and told him to pick up the ball.

105
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:04,590
Stop it.

106
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,900
My friend kicked him

107
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,190
and told him to pick up the ball.

108
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:09,040
My friend kicked him

109
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,590
and told him to pick up the ball.

110
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,830
He looked a bit weak.

111
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,630
Let me out of here!

112
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,550
Open the door!

113
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:15,950
Is anyone there?

114
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,230
I'm dying!

115
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,420
I'll show you.

116
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,830
I'll show you!

117
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,020
Dad!

118
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,300
Dad, please help me!

119
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,190
- Someone bullied me.
- The cue rack.

120
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,270
Hurry up, move quickly!

121
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:27,030
Do you know how to set up the balls?

122
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,190
Dad, Dad...

123
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,260
I don't have so much money.

124
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,590
If you don't, I'll find a way.

125
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,060
Dad, please save me.

126
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,190
- Dad...
- You don't have money!

127
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,740
If you don't, ask your dad for it.

128
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,590
You need to understand,

129
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,390
being too kind-hearted

130
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,380
is like a sword with no edge.

131
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,180
You must know that power and wealth

132
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,260
are the strongest shield and blade.

133
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,620
Once you have them,

134
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,110
and pursue them relentlessly,

135
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:57,260
only then can you get what you want.

136
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,230
It doesn't hurt.

137
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,550
3,000.

138
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,660
Can we stop this, Mr. Xu?

139
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,900
Set it up.

140
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,710
Here, is it set up right?

141
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,340
Answer me.

142
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,460
Is it right?

143
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,620
That's enough.

144
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,350
That's enough.

145
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:57,140
So this is how it feels to be on top.

146
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,340
(Calling...)

147
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,870
Hello? Shaoqing, what's up?

148
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,790
Xiluo,

149
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,270
we need to talk.

150
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:58,550
Talk about what?

151
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:00,100
What's going on?

152
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,380
Didn't you say we're friends?

153
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,110
Isn't it normal for friends to talk?

154
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,230
Nothing.

155
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,420
Alright.

156
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,380
Where are you?

157
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:12,660
I'll come pick you up.

158
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,500
I'll wait for you downstairs at the company.

159
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,900
Hello? Qi Han, what's up?

160
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:35,260
Xu Shaoqing doesn't look good.

161
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,470
What's your plan?

162
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,780
So, what are your plans?

163
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,230
We've discussed solutions,

164
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,700
but failed to reach a consensus.

165
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,350
I just wanted to ask for your thoughts.

166
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:47,860
Qi Han,

167
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,350
I can only tell you one thing.

168
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,900
Reality can be harsh.

169
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,350
Sometimes, you have to think for yourself.

170
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:58,380
So whatever you decide, I won't stop you.

171
00:11:58,700 --> 00:11:59,620
Go ahead and act on it.

172
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,780
But if you're asking me,

173
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,020
I can only tell you this.

174
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,980
Even though Xu Shaoqing is strict with me,

175
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,860
and sometimes scolds me for no reason,

176
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,660
he's still my boss.

177
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,380
He's the one who recognized my potential.

178
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,500
Sometimes,

179
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,380
you have to stay true to your conscience.

180
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,500
You already know the answer.

181
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,110
Why call me

182
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:34,590
to just seek comfort in yourself?

183
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,740
All these years,

184
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,110
I've watched you grow up.

185
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,820
You're practically like a son to me.

186
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:46,830
Yes, Mr. Zhang.

187
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,260
If it weren't for your support,

188
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,500
I'd probably have starved on the streets.

189
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,830
So whatever you need, just let me know.

190
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,550
I'll give it my all.

191
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,590
I have a son named Xu Shaoqing.

192
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,900
He's rather timid in nature.

193
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,350
When it comes to decisions,

194
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:08,900
he lacks judgment.

195
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,940
But you, you're sharp-minded.

196
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,950
You know what should and shouldn't be done.

197
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,230
I want you to stay by his side,

198
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,070
assist him, and protect him.

199
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,590
What do you think?

200
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,380
Mr. Zhang, absolutely no problem.

201
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:26,830
However,

202
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:29,310
I have one request for you.

203
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,070
Never betray him, no matter what.

204
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,740
Can you promise me that?

205
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:35,790
Mr. Zhang,

206
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,660
you've supported me all these years.

207
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,950
I will always remember your kindness.

208
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,700
So, regarding your request,

209
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,660
I'll give it my all.

210
00:13:47,350 --> 00:13:49,980
I promise to stay by Xu Shaoqing's side

211
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,780
and do everything to assist him.

212
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,260
I will never betray him.

213
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,140
Alright, Guan Yue.

214
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,310
I trust your promise.

215
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,640
- Have some tea.
- Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

216
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,350
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

217
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,550
Why are you looking at me like that?

218
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,270
Xu Shaoqing,

219
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,140
do you always handle things so harshly?

220
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,410
Have you thought about the consequences?

221
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,080
Why would I care about the consequences?

222
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,310
Right now, I feel like

223
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,710
from inside out, I'm completely ruined.

224
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:43,110
Because of you and Zhao Chuxi,

225
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,660
the two of you destroyed me.

226
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:50,950
I can't believe...

227
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,510
I can't believe I did so many foolish things

228
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:55,310
for the so-called love.

229
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,620
Xu Shaoqing,

230
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,190
calm down for a moment.

231
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,350
Think about your family.

232
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:04,460
Yes,

233
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,070
my family.

234
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,740
My family...

235
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:15,020
But, but...

236
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,620
I...

237
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,980
I don't have a family anymore.

238
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,980
I only have

239
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,950
a father who wouldn't even share his surname.

240
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,350
He's already gone.

241
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,590
He never deserved to be my dad.

242
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,950
No, no, no.

243
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,020
I should thank him.

244
00:15:54,780 --> 00:15:56,740
Xu Shaoqing, why are you looking for me?

245
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,700
I just want to...

246
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,620
Zhao Chuxi!

247
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,060
Zhao Chuxi, he wants to kill you.

248
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,670
- Don't listen to him.
- Wait a second.

249
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,620
Xu Shaoqing, what are you really up to?

250
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,860
I just want

251
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:13,660
to ask you out for a chat.

252
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,180
- Xu Shaoqing,
- Is that okay?

253
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,320
our issues don't involve him.

254
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,900
Zhao Chuxi, let me tell you this.

255
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,150
Stay out of this.

256
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,430
Get as far away as you can, got it?

257
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:25,830
Xu Shaoqing, I'm warning you, don't hurt her.

258
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,620
You're warning me?

259
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,780
What gives you the right to warn me?

260
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,900
You want me not to hurt Xiluo?

261
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,430
Fine.

262
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,620
Are you coming or not?

263
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,690
I'll give you ten seconds to decide.

264
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,790
One.

265
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,670
Two.

266
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,220
Three.

267
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,910
Four.

268
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,550
- Five.
- I'll go. Send me the address.

269
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:52,230
The intersection of Baowei Road
and Shunhe Road.

270
00:16:52,630 --> 00:16:53,980
Someone will guide you over.

271
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,660
Are you really going?

272
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,700
Yes, I'm going.

273
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,350
Since Xu Shaoqing is looking for death,

274
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,430
I'll help him fulfill that wish.

275
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:05,620
Then I'll go with you.

276
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,550
No need. Mr. Zhou is coming with me.

277
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,270
Relax, I'll handle it.

278
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,380
Well, old acquaintances.

279
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,590
How have things been lately?

280
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,190
Are you still wearing the same uniform?

281
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,180
The boss isn't treating you well, huh?

282
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,540
Mr. Zhao, get in the car.

283
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,620
Let's talk business first.

284
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,350
Mr. Xu only wants him to go alone.

285
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,830
Say something.

286
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,350
Why are you so quiet now?

287
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:13,460
Weren't you two bold before?

288
00:18:14,030 --> 00:18:16,420
Corner me in that alley and beat me up.

289
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,790
What now?

290
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,270
Afraid I'll hold a grudge and retaliate?

291
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,700
Is that it?

292
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,780
Exactly.

293
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,700
Xu Shaoqing.

294
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,380
You know his current situation well, right?

295
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,270
And yet you're still following him.

296
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,620
What if one day he falls from grace?

297
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,310
Have you thought about it?

298
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,140
Will I let you two off the hook?

299
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,380
Definitely not.

300
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,110
I'm offering you a way out now.

301
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:48,030
If you're willing to listen to me

302
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:50,070
and cooperate with me,

303
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,380
I can guarantee your safety.

304
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,830
If you two stay stubborn,

305
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,070
and insist on sticking with Xu Shaoqing,

306
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:02,510
then I can't make any promises.

307
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:16,270
What time is it? Why aren't they here yet?

308
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,310
Based on their route, they should be close.

309
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,060
They're here.

310
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,790
Zhao Chuxi, why are you here?

311
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,150
Zhao Chuxi,

312
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:46,070
you really came.

313
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:48,860
Seems like you've got some guts after all.

314
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:50,620
You asked me here,

315
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,380
so I had to come.

316
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,270
Guts, sure.

317
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:58,940
But there's nothing for us to discuss.

318
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,460
No, no, no.

319
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,350
We've got plenty to talk about.

320
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:04,790
For instance,

321
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,620
the matter involving the three of us

322
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,310
should be settled properly.

323
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,350
Wait a moment.

324
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:13,830
This is between you and me.

325
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:15,590
It has nothing to do with her.

326
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,750
Zhao Chuxi, don't try

327
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:20,430
to be a hero now. Get out of here!

328
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:21,940
My business has nothing to do with you.

329
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,740
Enough!

330
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:29,590
You two really are a shameless pair.

331
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,860
Neither of you is getting away today.

332
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:38,870
Tie him up.

333
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,540
Hold on.

334
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,270
You want to tie me up?

335
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:43,190
Fine.

336
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:46,030
But you have to agree to one condition.

337
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,900
Let her go.

338
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,740
I'll let you tie me

339
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,100
and let you do whatever you want.

340
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,020
Alright.

341
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,750
I agree.

342
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,590
Come on.

343
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,270
Let her go.

344
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,790
I don't.

345
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,590
You can't tell I was lying?

346
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,380
I don't even care about my life anymore.

347
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,940
Why would I care about reputation?

348
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,300
Exactly.

349
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,860
You've never had any reputation.

350
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,270
This is just who you are.

351
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:38,660
Even if you marry Su Xiluo,

352
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,420
you'll never win her heart.

353
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,180
That's nonsense!

354
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,630
Xiluo,

355
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,420
let me ask you something.

356
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:03,510
Have you ever loved Zhao Chuxi?

357
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,790
No. No.

358
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,900
Listen to me, Xu Shaoqing.

359
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:10,270
Do you think I'd care about someone like him?

360
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,820
He's never even crossed my mind.

361
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,990
So you have no reason

362
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:14,350
to target him.

363
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:15,990
If you hold grudges, come at me.

364
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,390
Alright?

365
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,590
Let me ask you another question.

366
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,310
Have you ever loved me?

367
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,270
Answer me!

368
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,550
I understand now.

369
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,350
You never truly loved me.

370
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,830
Xu Shaoqing!

371
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:01,380
Xu Shaoqing!

372
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,020
Xiluo,

373
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,300
everything is arranged.

374
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,510
Why are you doing this?

375
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,150
Tell me why.

376
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,350
I'm sorry.

377
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,580
Chuxi...

378
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,230
You have never wronged me.

379
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,420
Why?

380
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,110
Why?

381
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,510
Chuxi,

382
00:23:39,670 --> 00:23:41,830
I don't feel so tired now.

383
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:46,430
Let me take you to the hospital.

384
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,460
I'm here for you.

385
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,700
It's okay.

386
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:52,950
I'm fine.

387
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,790
It's all good now.

388
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,510
I'm okay, really.

389
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:00,860
I'm fine.

390
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:04,990
It's a bit cold.

391
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,420
Chuxi,

392
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,070
I know

393
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,420
you don't quite understand

394
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,590
many decisions I've made.

395
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,790
I'm really exhausted.

396
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,750
I have no one to talk to.

397
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,380
But, you know,

398
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,660
when you're here with me,

399
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,460
I feel completely at ease.

400
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:06,420
I'm not afraid of anything.

401
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,900
(Public Security Bureau)

402
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:42,340
(Su Xiluo was accidentally stabbed
by Xu Shaoqing)

403
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,920
(and passed away despite rescue efforts.)

404
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,860
(Xu Shaoqing was convicted of kidnapping
and intentional homicide,)

405
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,820
(sentenced to death
with lifetime deprivation of political right)

406
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:49,460
(and confiscation of all personal assets.)

407
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,190
(Guan Yue was convicted of kidnapping
and intentional injury,)

408
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:52,490
(sentenced to 12 years in prison)

409
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,460
(and a RMB 200,000 fine.)

410
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:54,490
(Qi Han assisted in the kidnapping;)

411
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,290
(given his voluntary surrender,
sentenced to 4 years in prison)

412
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:57,220
(and a RMB 20,000 fine.)

413
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,570
(Ma Chao assisted in the kidnapping;)

(given his voluntary surrender,
sentenced to 4 years in prison)

415
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,540
(and a RMB 20,000 fine.)

416
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,990
Ms. Cheng, you look stunning today!

417
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:11,910
Indeed.

418
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:13,830
- Morning.
- Morning.

419
00:26:14,270 --> 00:26:15,310
Good morning, everyone!

420
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,490
Good morning, Ms. Cheng!

421
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,820
Ms. Cheng, what's the occasion today?

422
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,270
Why are you looking so gorgeous?

423
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,340
Youth, right?

424
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,660
Isn't it all about making waves?

425
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:26,620
But there's always an end to it.

426
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,910
Lu Yao.

427
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:41,790
You're two minutes late.

428
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:44,940
I wanted to look better for you.

429
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,070
So I took a bit longer to tidy up.

430
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,900
How do I look now?

431
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,660
Much better.

432
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,580
Actually, many things

433
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:58,030
will change as time goes by.

434
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,510
Take this place for example.

435
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,790
It used to be an ancient city.

436
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,180
Now it looks like this.

437
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,350
But it still has a unique charm.

438
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:12,940
Hard to believe a thousand-year-old city

439
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,750
has transformed into this.

440
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,030
Truly, time brings great changes.

441
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,220
Do you think treasures can be found here?

442
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:23,580
You definitely won't find any.

443
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,990
Because I find a treasure.

444
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,300
- Really?
- Yeah.

445
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,140
What did you find?

446
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,380
I found you.

447
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,550
Your cheesy pick-up lines are too much.

448
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:37,030
Who taught you that?

449
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,110
Chuxi taught me.

450
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,510
He gave me a book

451
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,460
titled How to Talk to Girls Book.

452
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,590
You should spend less time with him.

453
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,430
Alright, I'll hang out with Chuxi less.

454
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,710
I'll spend more time with you.

455
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,030
Because I like you.

456
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,900
I know.

457
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,820
So... do you not like me back?

458
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,620
You always tease me for no reason.

459
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,900
Teasing you doesn't mean I don't like you.

460
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,790
Haven't you heard the saying?

461
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,790
Teasing is affection, scolding is love.

462
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,660
True love comes from playful banter.

463
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,340
Oh my goodness.

464
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,420
That makes sense.

465
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,260
Silly you.

466
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,340
- Lu Yao, let me tell you a joke.
- Sure.

467
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,070
Do you want a cold joke or a hot joke?

468
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,990
Maybe it's better if you don't.

469
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:31,790
