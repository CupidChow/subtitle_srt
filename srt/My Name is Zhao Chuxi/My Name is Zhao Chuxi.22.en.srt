00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,180
=My Name is Zhao Chuxi=

2
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,180
=Episode 22=

3
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:08,340
Do you think this is good or bad?

4
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,980
Every opportunity carries risks and rewards.

5
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,790
It depends on which one you can seize.

6
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,820
Which one can I seize?

7
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:26,430
No matter how risky the opportunity is,

8
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:28,180
I have to seize it.

9
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:30,510
Because for me,

10
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,030
it's the only way to change my fate.

11
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,310
So, risky or not, I have to go for it.

12
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,870
Looks like you're ready.

13
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,310
Ready or not, I have to go for it.

14
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,510
I understand.

15
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,440
Well, I should head back now.

16
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:48,380
I plan to book a flight to Bei City tomorrow.

17
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,380
Chuxi, do you know something?

18
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,030
Before I met you,

19
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,670
I was someone

20
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,790
with no thoughts or goals in life.

21
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,870
I'm truly glad to have met you in this life.

22
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,790
You dare to dream and act.

23
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:03,150
You face problems and make your own choices.

24
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,950
Granny asked you a good question.

25
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,620
If you know clearly

26
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:09,710
it's the right thing,

27
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,710
but doing it might harm yourself,

28
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:13,260
would you still do it?

29
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:16,270
Every time, your actions gave me the answer.

30
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,230
Also,

31
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:21,430
when you return to Jia City,

32
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,210
if you make a name for yourself,

33
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,710
but I don't measure up,

34
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,110
Granny's spirit would surely scold me.

35
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:30,500
To prevent dangers in Jia City,

36
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,270
I'll introduce you to my junior master.

37
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,900
He'll arrive in a few days.

38
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,020
Alright.

39
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:46,820
(Security Check Entrance)

40
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:47,670
Erpang,

41
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:50,270
wish you everything goes well.

42
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,710
Chuxi, keep it up.

43
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,710
I believe when you return to Jia City,

44
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,390
you'll achieve everything you desire.

45
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,560
I'll work hard too when I go back,

46
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,660
so I can support you in the future.

47
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,430
I haven already said it.

48
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:05,030
I will definitely go back.

49
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,430
When I become even stronger,

50
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:10,900
I'll reclaim everything that belongs to me

51
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,690
and everything that belongs to us.

52
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,460
Bro,

53
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,030
we met when we had nothing.

54
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,150
I hope someday soon,

55
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,270
we'll meet again at the top.

56
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,020
Take care.

57
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,710
According to the latest reports,

58
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,990
Sanjiang Group's chairman Jian Ying
has passed away.

59
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,660
A mysterious Mr. Zhao
will take over Sanjiang Group,

60
00:04:02,990 --> 00:04:05,820
(Jian Ying passed away)
shaking Sanjiang City's business world.

61
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,740
As for this mysterious Mr. Zhao,

62
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,270
there's a lot of speculation outside.

63
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,550
Sanjiang Group employees are anxious.

64
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,940
We will continue tracking this story.

65
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,220
Everything has been arranged.

66
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,060
Let's go.

67
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,540
(Yujing Longcheng)

68
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,950
Greetings, Mr. Zhao.

69
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:38,990
Ms. Liu,

70
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,710
Aunt Jian is no longer here.

71
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,590
I'll keep watch over this villa for her.

72
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,220
It stays the way it used to be.

73
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,390
Everything remains as it was.

74
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,050
I'm still the same person I used to be.

75
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,270
Two arms and two legs.

76
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,980
Not some superhuman with extra limbs.

77
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,780
Calling me Zhao, I feel at ease.

78
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:54,620
Well,

79
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,100
can I?

80
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,630
Sure, you can.

81
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,130
Wang,

82
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,460
the company is short-staffed.
Follow me later.

83
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,760
Thank you for the opportunity.

84
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,980
You've just inherited the company.

85
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,420
Everyone rushed here to welcome you.

86
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,470
We couldn't even stop them.

87
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,130
If you're feeling uncomfortable,

88
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,190
I can ask them to leave.

89
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,100
If there's something you want,

90
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,190
or anything you need,

91
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,710
just tell me. I'll take you to get it.

92
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,470
I don't have any specific requests.

93
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,650
I'm easygoing. Anything works for me.

94
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,760
This is all arranged by Aunt Jian.

95
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,740
It's safe here.

96
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,780
Alright, I'll follow her arrangements.

97
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,860
Everything remains the same.

98
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,530
Just get me a bigger bed.

99
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,950
I tend to move a lot in my sleep.

100
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,540
Huang Tu, take them to tidy up.

101
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,430
Hmm, yeah.

102
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:33,960
Let's go.

103
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,070
Over there is the garden.

104
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,070
If you have any requests,

105
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,910
you can ask Ms. Liu to take care of it.

106
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,780
No need for that.

107
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,750
Just leave the plants and flowers there.

108
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,340
I'll sort them out myself later.

109
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,510
You can give Wang a chance,

110
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,340
but you shouldn't trust him fully.

111
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,260
Got it.

112
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,770
Did you see the way he looked at me just now?

113
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:59,060
His eyes darted around sneakily.

114
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,960
I can tell he's just out for his own gain.

115
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,370
You do have a good eye for people.

116
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,510
Guess what he just came to me about?

117
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,140
He asked for a raise

118
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,070
and even came up with the amount himself.

119
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,900
That's what he has got.

120
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,550
Oh, by the way,

121
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,830
you saw those cars in the garage, right?

122
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,190
If you don't like it,

123
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,710
you can tell me. I'll arrange it.

124
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:20,380
Sure.

125
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:22,420
Get me a gold luxury car

126
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,270
worth 50 million,

127
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:25,510
the super shiny kind.

128
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:27,700
No problem.

129
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,030
Don't mention 50 million,

130
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,470
even a 100-million car is doable.

131
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,220
Just kidding.

132
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,470
Furong,

133
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,220
let's get serious and talk about Aunt Jian.

134
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,590
Zhao Chuxi,

135
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,660
the past is in the past.

136
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,630
Aunt Jian has watched me grow up.

137
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,540
Anyone Aunt Jian approves of

138
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,750
is also someone I trust.

139
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,340
Furong, now tell me specifically

140
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,340
about my situation.

141
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,190
Speaking of which,

142
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,750
the Board Meeting is in five days.

143
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,950
They want to remove you as chairman.

144
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,590
Your priority now is saving Sanjiang Group

145
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,150
and protecting Aunt Jian's legacy.

146
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,900
Don't let them ruin you.

147
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,300
Got it.

148
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,220
I want to meet Song Qingci.

149
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,970
I'll arrange it right away.

150
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,460
Zhao Chuxi, Song Qingci is here.

151
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:43,780
Mr. Zhao, my apologies.

152
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,910
I'm late.

153
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,190
It's fine. Please sit.

154
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:49,180
I'll go make the arrangements.

155
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,950
Qingci,

156
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,390
can I fully trust you?

157
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,780
Aunt Jian is my only true family.

158
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,180
As for what Aunt Jian has said,

159
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,420
I will never betray.

160
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:11,150
You're an orphan?

161
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,510
I grew up in an orphanage.

162
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,420
I met Aunt Jian in middle school.

163
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,000
She supported me through my education

164
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,830
and placed me with an ordinary family

165
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,720
until I graduated college.

166
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:32,390
After graduation, she let me join Sanjiang.

167
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,350
What do you think?

168
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,870
Sorry about that.

169
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:39,390
It's no big deal.

170
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:42,060
I'm just stating the facts.

171
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,030
I've never felt unlucky about my life.

172
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:48,030
Actually, I think I'm pretty fortunate.

173
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,220
At least I had the chance to meet Aunt Jian.

174
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,870
She truly changed my life.

175
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,990
I completely agree with what you're saying.

176
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,230
To be honest, I'm an orphan too.

177
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,110
I was born in a place called Phoenix Village

178
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,350
in Wanjing Mountain.

179
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,700
The night I was born,

180
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:07,780
my mom passed away

181
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,780
due to the difficult birth.

182
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,820
In order to save her,

183
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,470
my dad braved the snow to find a doctor.

184
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:17,780
But he never returned.

185
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,300
Not even his remains were found.

186
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,370
What's buried in his grave now

187
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,150
is only his clothing.

188
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,870
Yet, I've made it through all of this.

189
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,030
And now, I've reached this position.

190
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,470
Don't you think that's quite ironic?

191
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,630
You seem pretty indifferent, though.

192
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,350
Tell me in detail

193
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,390
how I can gain control

194
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:49,350
of the Sanjiang Group.

195
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,870
It's difficult,

196
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,060
but not impossible.

197
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,080
Let me explain it to you like this.

198
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,780
Sanjiang operates under a board system.

199
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,510
Aunt Jian holds four seats on the Board.

200
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,150
One seat is hers personally,

201
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:08,700
and CFO Gu Donglin holds another.

202
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,020
And me.

203
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,780
Aunt Jian hasn't used

204
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,150
the last seat.

205
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,990
He Yuanshan and Mr. Du each have two seats.

206
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,060
Wu Heping and Chen Tao each hold one.

207
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:22,900
I want to know what the company shares

208
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:26,470
of these seats in the company are.

209
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:29,700
Aunt Jian holds 43% of the shares.

210
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,180
Furong holds 4%.

211
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,660
I hold 3%.

212
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,870
He Yuanshan holds 16%.

213
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,270
Mr. Du has 15%.

214
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:39,750
Wu Heping and Chen Tao each hold 10%.

215
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:42,270
If you want actual control of Sanjiang,

216
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,580
there are two ways.

217
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,350
First, you need to acquire

218
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,060
over 51% of the shares.

219
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,420
With the shares of Aunt Jian, Furong, and me,

220
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,870
you're still short by 1%.

221
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,900
The second way is

222
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:56,700
getting over half the Board's approval.

223
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,300
I understand now.

224
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:01,180
Whether it's the shares I can secure,

225
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,030
or the Board's approval,

226
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,230
I need to make more shareholders

227
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,420
stand on my side.

228
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:07,390
You're quite sharp.

229
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,350
So, who do you think

230
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,390
I should form an alliance with now?

231
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:16,390
Du Xinan or Chen Tao.

232
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,180
Getting one of them onboard is enough.

233
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,780
I can give it a try.

234
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,540
It's not that simple though.

235
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,510
What they're aiming for now

236
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,180
is to pull you down.

237
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:29,180
That way, the company falls into their hands.

238
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,870
Pull me down?

239
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,420
No matter how hard, I must try.

240
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,690
I'll face whatever comes my way.

241
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,360
So, who do you want to contact first?

242
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,660
- Chen Tao.
- Okay, I'll arrange it now.

243
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,500
No rush.

244
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,390
The most important thing now is

245
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:48,270
I need to build my own team first.

246
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,020
(Bei City Station)

247
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,060
Who is it that requires you to pick him up?

248
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,270
(Entrance)
Erpang has left.

249
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,920
His junior master is coming over

250
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,230
and staying by my side.

251
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,900
Is he stronger than Erpang?

252
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,060
Probably.

253
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,510
He's a senior. His skills must be good.

254
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,740
A master.

255
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,110
Hello? Is this Mr. Zhou?

256
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,220
Hello? Is this Zhao Chuxi?

257
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,220
Yes, that's me.

258
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,040
I'm in a brown suit. At the exit.

259
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,520
You'll see me as soon as you come out.

260
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,870
Got it, the exit, right?

261
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,350
Mr. Zhou.

262
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,710
Zhao Chuxi.

263
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,590
Zhou Yi.

264
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,590
- Nice to meet you.
- Furong.

265
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,020
Nice to meet you.

266
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,700
Mr. Zhou, your style is unique.

267
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,620
What's wrong?

268
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,260
Is there a problem?

269
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,140
It looks good.

270
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,120
- Let's go.
- Go.

271
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,590
- Here.
- Let me take it.

272
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,590
Let me.

273
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,750
How was the trip?

274
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,230
Not bad.

275
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:03,820
Hello?

276
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:06,470
You finally remembered to call me, huh?

277
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,210
What's up? Everything okay over there?

278
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:09,070
All good now.

279
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:10,470
I'm at Sanjiang Group now.

280
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,300
Sanjiang Group?

281
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:16,990
Wow, luck really turned around for you.

282
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,420
Guess it's fate.

283
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,870
How are you doing?

284
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,060
Still in Bei City?

285
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,020
Yeah, I'm here.

286
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,390
I found a quiet place recently.

287
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,390
Doing some farm work

288
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,220
makes me pretty relaxing.

289
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,870
Looks like you're truly free now.

290
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,420
Yeah.

291
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,540
The mistakes I made years ago are settled.

292
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,150
I'm feeling much better now.

293
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:39,780
So what's next?

294
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,900
Planning to farm forever?

295
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,270
Then I need to see if there's anything

296
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,190
worth me going back for.

297
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,900
I'm returning to Jia City in a grand manner.

298
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,350
Alright.

299
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,480
I'll be there for you.

300
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,350
Thanks, bro.

301
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,820
This kind of Tieguanyin is truly rare.

302
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,660
It has been years. You've lost weight.

303
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,270
How much heavier was I before?

304
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,470
I don't think I've changed much.

305
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:50,990
Xu Lin,

306
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,180
you are no longer the person you used to be.

307
00:14:56,570 --> 00:15:00,060
That sharpness and edge are all gone now.

308
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,880
Coming back to Bei City

309
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,630
shows you've moved on from the past.

310
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,350
I was young back then,

311
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,940
reckless and bold, taking risky paths.

312
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,750
And I must pay a heavy price.

313
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,150
Moving on or not doesn't really matter.

314
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,490
As long as my heart finds peace,

315
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,540
nothing will seem important anymore.

316
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,730
Where have you been these past years?

317
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,110
I asked many people for news about you,

318
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,820
but no one could find you.

319
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:44,510
I went everywhere

320
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,330
and traveled across half of China.

321
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,540
Anyway,

322
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,580
wherever I can make a living, I'll go.

323
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,750
Is it tough?

324
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,780
Tough...

325
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,060
Not really.

326
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:09,670
Anyway, it's all in the past now.

327
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,370
Where's the person you're waiting for?

328
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,350
Why not here yet?

329
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,420
Maybe soon.

330
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,260
- A man or woman?
- A man.

331
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,350
You're still wearing the watch.

332
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,040
Since the day you gave it to me...

333
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:48,110
It's getting late.

334
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:52,150
I need to take my son to his grandpa's.

335
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:56,060
I can't...

336
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,260
Keep waiting.

337
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,140
You go ahead.

338
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,870
Actually...

339
00:17:16,710 --> 00:17:17,550
I'm leaving.

340
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,590
Wen Qian.

341
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:30,510
Do you hate me?

342
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,860
I didn't expect the tea house owner

343
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,100
to be your old flame.

344
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,510
A story there?

345
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,060
Who are you?

346
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,580
Don't you recognize me?

347
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,300
Who invited you today?

348
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,780
Long time no see, you've lost weight.

349
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,670
Everyone says the same when they see me.

350
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,780
Haven't you heard

351
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,470
that every fat guy has hidden potential?

352
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:29,820
Wow, now you're wearing sunglasses.

353
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,870
Even your hair is styled differently.

354
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,540
Did you come here this time

355
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,430
just to show off your weight loss?

356
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,710
Chuxi inherited Aunt Jian's company.

357
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,270
Did you know about that?

358
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,710
That's great news.

359
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,710
I never thought

360
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,780
one good deed would benefit me today.

361
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,100
So when doing business,

362
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:51,910
one cannot only consider profit,
but also the people.

363
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:54,660
That's true.

364
00:18:55,190 --> 00:18:56,910
Old friends are always the best,

365
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,780
unforgettable no matter where we roam.

366
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,140
When my granny was hospitalized,

367
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,790
thank you for covering the expenses for me.

368
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,560
No need to mention that between friends.

369
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:08,340
Chuxi told me

370
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,100
that he wants you

371
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,750
to go and help him out.

372
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,820
Old friends are always the best,

373
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,710
unforgettable no matter where we roam.

374
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:27,910
Looks like

375
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,030
it's time to go back.

376
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,820
(Domestic Arrival)

377
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,910
It's been a while since we last met.

378
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,710
You look pretty good.

379
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,830
Not bad.

380
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:12,270
Why did you come back?

381
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,820
Don't you know why I came back?

382
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,400
Let me tell you something.

383
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,750
I've given up my normal life

384
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,670
just to help you out.

385
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:20,820
Thanks, bro.

386
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,860
Why do you sound so distant now?

387
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:26,270
Distant? We're brothers,

388
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,540
sharing drinks and food together,

389
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:30,470
sharing fortunes, and you bear the hardships.

390
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,850
You've got quite the carefree attitude.

391
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,720
Do you even realize how dangerous this is?

392
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,140
What's your plan now?

393
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:41,510
I'm planning to meet Du Xinan and Chen Tao.

394
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:43,660
I'll go with you.

395
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:46,750
At critical moments, it depends on you.

396
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,070
Let's go.

397
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:54,780
I didn't expect the first person

398
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:57,910
Zhao Chuxi wanted to see would be me.

399
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,270
What's his intention?

400
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:03,990
If He Yuanshan and the others find out

401
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:05,270
we're meeting in private,

402
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,640
I'm afraid it won't be good.

403
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,300
After all, He Yuanshan has the upper hand.

404
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:10,950
As long as we're cautious,

405
00:21:11,670 --> 00:21:13,300
the news won't leak out.

406
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,700
Go meet with him.

407
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,470
See what leverage he brings to the table.

408
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,540
Meeting him doesn't mean supporting him.

409
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:23,950
But avoiding him will definitely offend him.

410
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,950
So we still need to meet him.

411
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:30,980
Alright.

412
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,230
Let's meet him then.

413
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,670
But only the two of us meet him.

414
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,230
No one else can know about this.

415
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,340
I didn't expect you to meet me first.

416
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,230
Surprised, aren't you?

417
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,340
A little surprised.

418
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,670
But it makes sense.

419
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:55,060
Ms. Jian is the chairman of Sanjiang Group.

420
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,750
What she says goes.

421
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,010
Besides, Ms. Jian has treated you well.

422
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,140
I hope you can stand by my side.

423
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,780
I've always stayed neutral, so you think

424
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,440
it's easier to win me over.

425
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,910
As long as I nod,

426
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,270
you can remain in Sanjiang Group,

427
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,030
and even take control of it.

428
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,270
That's right.

429
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,850
You are absolutely right.

430
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,750
I came to see you today

431
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,510
because of tomorrow morning's matter.

432
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,990
He Yuanshan has publicly expressed his desire

433
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,380
to compete for the position of chairman.

434
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:31,710
But honestly speaking,

435
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:34,990
if He Yuanshan takes over Sanjiang Group,

436
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,750
can he truly manage it well?

437
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:39,430
Can he avoid pocketing the money himself?

438
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,670
As for me,

439
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,270
even if I don't become chairman,

440
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:45,140
everything Ms. Jian left to me,

441
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,620
I still hold about 50% of the shares.

442
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:50,030
I'm still the largest shareholder.

443
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,300
Yes, I admit it.

444
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,510
But so what?

445
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:57,100
Let me be honest with you.

446
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:00,340
What he offers is incredibly generous.

447
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:03,190
Just tell me straight what you can offer me.

448
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,270
2% of the company shares.

449
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,300
Two seats on the Board.

450
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:10,140
Operating rights in Jiangbei will be yours.

451
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,140
Your interests are fully maximized.

452
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,300
To be honest,

453
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,850
what you're offering is very tempting.

454
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:27,940
Chen,

455
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,860
sometimes people have to be decisive.

456
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,860
Fortune favors the bold, doesn't it?

457
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,910
(This man, not even 30 yet)

458
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,860
(has a composure and sophistication
beyond his years.)

459
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:44,060
(He offers exactly what's needed.)

460
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,950
(Now this is genuine sincerity.)

461
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,100
(But Chen Tao didn't know)

462
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,750
(if he dared to take this risk,)

463
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:51,620
(if he dared to trust this person.)

464
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:54,750
(He knows Zhao Chuxi can't
defeat He Yuanshan.)

465
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,270
I need to think this through carefully.

466
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,190
I'll wait for your decision.

467
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,270
See you.

468
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:11,910
Did you hear that?

469
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,620
2% of the company shares.

470
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,910
Two seats and operating rights.

471
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,090
Let me tell you something.

472
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,990
Who's the chairman doesn't matter.

473
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,270
Maximizing interests is what matters.

474
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,240
Zhao Chuxi

475
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,910
really got some skill.

476
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:39,820
Now let me ask you.

477
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,670
If you controlled Sanjiang Group,

478
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,510
what would you do?

479
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,710
First, I'd eliminate Ms. Jian's influence.

480
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:49,310
Then, I'd weaken

481
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,190
the power of Sanjiang Group's veterans

482
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,270
and make the share distribution
more balanced.

483
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:56,950
I think

484
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,380
this is what Ms. Jian would have wanted.

485
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,580
Eliminating Ms. Jian's influence?

486
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:05,190
Weakening the power of us veterans?

487
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:09,270
Do you think I have a reason to support you?

488
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,060
Mr. Du,

489
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,820
it seems I shouldn't invite you here today.

490
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,660
Indeed.

491
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:18,750
This is what you said correctly tonight.

492
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:21,790
I'll take my leave.

493
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,060
This Du Xinan really doesn't know his place.

494
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:30,550
Furong,

495
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,180
what are you doing?

496
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,950
Mr. Du isn't easily swayed.

497
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:39,910
This trip was a waste of time.

498
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,670
But every situation has its pros and cons.

499
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,300
A bad turn might not be all bad.

500
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,940
It could also be the start of something good.

501
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,100
Both of them are seasoned players.

502
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,510
Everyone said they don't support you,

503
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,230
but they all asked about your bottom line.

504
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,710
This's your only chance for success tomorrow.

505
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:02,920
But the probability is slim.

506
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,780
Although our chances of winning are slim,

507
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,190
we must do our best.

508
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,910
Proceed as scheduled.

509
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,540
The Board agenda will follow its order.

510
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,470
Everyone, stay focused.

511
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:27,430
Hold your ground till the very end.

512
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,950
Let them see

513
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,710
the energy and spirit we have.

514
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,870
Got it.

515
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,030
Mr. Zhao.

516
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:20,430
How's it outside?

517
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:21,580
They're waiting to go.

518
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:24,140
Mr. Zhao, we have confidence in you.

519
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,470
Anyway, that's it.

520
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,980
The battlefield awaits us shortly.

521
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,350
Cheer yourself up.

522
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:31,830
Nice outfit.

523
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,510
Really? Looks sharp, huh?

524
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,070
Let's go.

525
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:13,380
Everyone, please welcome the new chairman,

526
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,750
Zhao Chuxi.

527
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,300
(Sanjiang Group)

528
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,750
Hello, everyone.

529
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,860
My name is Zhao Chuxi.

530
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:31,860
From now on, we are family.

531
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:35,060
If you have anything you'd like to say to me,

532
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,990
or anything you'd like me to take care of,

533
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,910
feel free to come directly to me.

534
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:41,910
I will always be here.

535
00:28:59,750 --> 00:29:00,590
Ms. Song,

536
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,750
how likely is Mr. Zhao to succeed today?

537
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,710
Under normal circumstances,

538
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,860
he is bound to lose.

539
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:17,660
(Sanjiang Group)

540
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,580
My name is Zhao Chuxi.

541
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,670
Everyone's familiar with me, right?

542
00:29:39,470 --> 00:29:40,990
Let me get straight to the point.

543
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:44,910
First, Sanjiang Group will remain stable

544
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:47,910
and only face minor challenges temporarily.

545
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,620
I hope everyone is prepared for this.

546
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:53,270
Over the years, Sanjiang Group

547
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:55,910
has thrived under Ms. Jian's leadership.

548
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:57,750
It has expanded into various industries.

549
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:02,100
It is now a leading force in Sanjiang.

550
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,750
So, everyone can rest assured

551
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:08,030
my arrival is merely to inherit her career.

552
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:09,670
As for the company's future,

553
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,140
it will rely on your ideas and efforts.

554
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,470
For the growth of Sanjiang Group,

555
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:17,780
I introduce a new colleague to you today.

556
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:19,990
