1
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,180
=My Name is Zhao Chuxi=

2
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,140
=Episode 28=

3
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,590
Uncle Liu has lived through so much.

4
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,620
If he seeks revenge just because

5
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:12,690
you ruined his banquet and embarrassed him,

6
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,390
it's pure luck Uncle Liu made it this far.

7
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:17,110
But what if I told you

8
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,230
Uncle Liu sent me here,

9
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:20,870
would you believe that?

10
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,180
Uncle Liu sent you here?

11
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,060
Exactly.

12
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:27,310
He asked me to find out

13
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,950
what your real intentions are.

14
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,950
Or rather,

15
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,750
what will it take for you to let this go?

16
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:38,340
Fine. Then help me gather

17
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,980
all of Zhou Bin's criminal records

18
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,060
from over the years.

19
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,670
Bring them all to me.

20
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,590
That's it.

21
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,740
Alright, I've got it.

22
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,070
Then I won't disturb you anymore.

23
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:52,990
By the way,

24
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,230
there's one more thing.

25
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:56,620
I'm going camping with a friend tomorrow,

26
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,590
only taking Zhou Yi with me.

27
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,380
What do you mean?

28
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,820
Just tell Uncle Liu exactly as I said.

29
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,740
Alright, I'll take my leave then.

30
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,790
Father.

31
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,260
Zhao Chuxi said his target is Zhou Bin.

32
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,540
If we support Zhou Bin,

33
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:34,700
then we'll be his enemy.

34
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,430
He specifically asked me to relay this:

35
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:39,190
tomorrow, he's going camping with a friend,

36
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,190
only taking Zhou Yi.

37
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,790
Father, what should we do next?

38
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,580
We've received the photos.

39
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,260
Zhou, don't worry.

40
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,230
Get ready to move.

41
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,820
Zhao Chuxi,

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,950
I want to plead for him.

43
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,500
I know you're bound

44
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:22,300
to clash with him fiercely this time.

45
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,030
So I want to plead for Xu Shaoqing.

46
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,580
Pleading for him so early?

47
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,230
How do you know I'll win?

48
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,580
I'm not sure you'll win.

49
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:35,110
But I'm certain he's going to lose.

50
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,030
Why's that?

51
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,660
I have my own judgment

52
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,300
for everything.

53
00:03:41,150 --> 00:03:42,950
Come on!

54
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,070
Zhao Chuxi,

55
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,980
I know Xu Shaoqing isn't a good person.

56
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,570
I also know my request

57
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:54,670
is a bit much.

58
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,390
But I've grown up with him since childhood.

59
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,310
I agreed.

60
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,030
Yes, I've agreed.

61
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,190
You agreed?

62
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,780
You're asking me for this.

63
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,540
If I don't agree, it feels wrong.

64
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:10,860
Besides, you have your standards.

65
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,740
I have mine too.

66
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,740
You're crazy.

67
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,620
Look at what you've done.

68
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:20,230
It's minus 40 degrees in this snow.

69
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,300
You camp outdoors with me, huh?

70
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,150
Only someone like you could pull this off.

71
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,900
Didn't you say there'd be a good show

72
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,240
and tell me to find a unique spot?

73
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,750
Isn't this place unique enough?

74
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,620
Indeed, very unique.

75
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,460
Mr. Zhou, please refill the cup.

76
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,470
On it.

77
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,230
Looks like they're camping here.

78
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,630
Before it gets dark,

79
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,860
they probably won't leave.

80
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,660
Well, that's lucky for us.

81
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,590
This deep forest is quite the spot.

82
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,860
Are you sure it's just these few people?

83
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,780
Yes, I'm sure.

84
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,860
The intel is from the employer.

85
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,420
And it's confirmed he only has one bodyguard.

86
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,420
You're all so slow.

87
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,380
If you don't act now, I'll freeze to death.

88
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,750
The other two were knocked out.

89
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,670
They're in the woods.

90
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,950
Trying to assassinate me in broad daylight?

91
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:39,150
Assassinations, huh?

92
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,070
Let me tell you,

93
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,420
I've already called the police.

94
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,350
What a good show!

95
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,190
Erpang, sis,

96
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,780
try Mr. Zhou's tea.

97
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,030
Alright, I'll give it a taste.

98
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:52,980
It's really amazing!

99
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,900
(Police)

100
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,860
(Jiahua Police Station)

101
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,020
The record has been completed.

102
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:02,150
Thanks for your cooperation.

103
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,620
If there are new updates on the case,

104
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,950
we will contact you immediately.

105
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,870
Thanks.

106
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,820
It's done?

107
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,150
Here comes the final act.

108
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:20,300
Zhou, something happened.

109
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,420
What's wrong?

110
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,550
Zhao Chuxi called the police.

111
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,340
Called the police?

112
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,740
What do we do? Should we run?

113
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,830
Zhao Chuxi!

114
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,060
He's playing dirty tricks on me.

115
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,580
He...

116
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:39,870
What now, Zhou?

117
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,940
Call Uncle Liu.

118
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,380
City Bureau Criminal Investigation Squad.

119
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,420
(Summons)
Mr. Zhou, Mr. Jiang,

120
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,340
come with us, please.

121
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,670
Let's go.

122
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,940
What are you doing?

123
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:57,950
What's going on?

124
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,350
- Let go of me!
- Let go of me!

125
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,540
Let go of me!

126
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:01,980
Release me now!

127
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,150
(Defendant Zhou Bin convicted
of attempted murder,)

128
00:07:04,154 --> 00:07:05,230
(sentenced to eight years in prison;)

129
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,330
(convicted of intentional injury, )

130
00:07:06,334 --> 00:07:08,140
(sentenced to 3 years;
combined sentence: 10 years imprisonment.)

131
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,440
(Defendant Jiang Tan convicted of attempted murder,
sentenced to 8 years in prison;)

132
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,400
(convicted of intentional injury,)

133
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,440
(sentenced to seven years;)

134
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,140
(combined sentence: 14 years imprisonment.)

135
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:17,990
So Zhou Bin and Jiang Tan have been arrested?

136
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,950
That's correct.

137
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,180
So Zhao Chuxi's next move

138
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:23,110
is very likely to target us.

139
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,910
Gather everything that happened recently

140
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,270
and compile it into a report for my dad.

141
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:34,310
Got it.

142
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,980
Targeting me, right?

143
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,180
Are you unaware

144
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,110
that targeting me

145
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,710
means provoking Zhang's Group?

146
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,190
Chuxi.

147
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,620
I want to ask you something.

148
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,860
Go ahead.

149
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,940
How can I defeat Sanwu?

150
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,270
- Eat more.
- Well...

151
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,910
You both have the same master

152
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:10,710
and learn the same moves.

153
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,420
But why can't you beat him?

154
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,070
Because he is heavier.

155
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,690
Greater the weight, greater the strength.

156
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:16,540
Got it?

157
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,420
No, our styles are different.

158
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,420
I focus on a slender beauty.

159
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,750
Lean in clothes, fit without.

160
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,980
The slender beauty has nothing

161
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,830
to do with if you can defeat him.

162
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,620
You're just too self-absorbed, you know?

163
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:29,280
Also, there's one more thing.

164
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,270
If you gain weight in the future,

165
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,350
it might affect you finding a girlfriend,

166
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,320
so this issue

167
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,470
is not just about beating Erpang anymore.

168
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,060
Now, it's about a choice

169
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,030
on your life's path.

170
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,770
Will you choose to surpass Erpang

171
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,870
or prioritize relationships?

172
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,740
The choice is yours.

173
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:43,660
Is it contradictory?

174
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,840
Of course.

175
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,580
If you don't eat more, you won't gain weight,

176
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,940
nor get more strength,

177
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,470
and you can't beat Erpang as a result.

178
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,570
Erpang has slimmed down now.

179
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,520
If you gain weight now,

180
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,310
you'll definitely outmatch him later.

181
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,910
But if you gain weight,

182
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,150
you'll lose your slender beauty,

183
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,190
and without slender beauty,

184
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,300
no young girls notice you.

185
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,510
No girls are interested in you,

186
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:00,710
so you can't find a girlfriend.

187
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:02,030
That seems contradictory though.

188
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:02,930
Make a choice yourself.

189
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,030
This isn't about beating Erpang anymore.

190
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,270
Mr. Zhou, you're facing life choices now.

191
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,840
You're at a crossroads.

192
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,350
Will you choose women or martial arts?

193
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,240
Think it through, life is just a few decades.

194
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,380
Eat! I'll go all out against him.

195
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,320
Focus on martial arts instead.

196
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,350
- Exactly.
- Sounds good.

197
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,060
First, find him and settle the game.

198
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,060
Dominate him first.

199
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,350
Alright, I'll practice a bit myself first.

200
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:40,420
What are you doing?

201
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,380
Sanwu, let's have a real match today.

202
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,780
Have you figured it out?

203
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:49,940
Agreed to face me for the 500th match?

204
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:52,700
Today, let's try something different.

205
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,660
What kind of challenge?

206
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,110
Rock-paper-scissors.

207
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,740
Scissors.

208
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,900
Oh my goodness.

209
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:01,230
You're so childish.

210
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,110
Who gave you this idea?

211
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:04,700
Zhao Chuxi taught me.

212
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,110
He said to suppress your momentum first.

213
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:07,970
Do you dare?

214
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,860
Oh my goodness.

215
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:11,260
You've completely been led astray by Chuxi.

216
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,310
Fine.

217
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,350
Why would I be scared?

218
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,350
Alright, hold on.

219
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,510
Are we doing one quick round or three?

220
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,620
One quick round, of course.

221
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,360
Bring it on.

222
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,350
You're really into it today. Here we go.

223
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:24,270
Here we go.

224
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,980
Rock-paper-scissors.

225
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:33,310
I won the 500th round.

226
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,630
Let's play another game.

227
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,030
Come on!

228
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:36,950
I'm leaving now.

229
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,550
No.

230
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,260
Was I too obvious?

231
00:10:51,390 --> 00:10:52,310
Come in.

232
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,710
This is Shaoqing's current situation.

233
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,230
What does he want to say?

234
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,150
Mr. Zhang,

235
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,580
he wants to say he can't handle Zhao Chuxi.

236
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:11,740
He hopes you can help him.

237
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,860
Guan Yue.

238
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,350
How long have you worked by my side?

239
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:28,350
Mr. Zhang, you raised me

240
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,500
since childhood.

241
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:30,870
If it weren't for you,

242
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:32,560
I'd probably still be

243
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:34,140
a homeless orphan on the streets.

244
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,020
You're practically Shaoqing's bro.

245
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,710
But look at him.

246
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:41,230
He hasn't made any progress at all.

247
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,550
He can't even handle Zhao Chuxi.

248
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:47,150
Fine.

249
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,070
Let me see

250
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:53,140
what kind of ability this lad has got.

251
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:02,380
I didn't expect Zhang Shengbai
to reach out to me.

252
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,540
Are you planning to go?

253
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,460
Yes.

254
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,380
I have to meet him in person.

255
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:08,740
Let Erpang go with you.

256
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,910
No need.

257
00:12:11,510 --> 00:12:12,710
I'll go alone first

258
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,430
and confuse him.

259
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,380
Everything proceeds as planned.

260
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,550
Before the big fish bites and gets reeled in,

261
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,190
I'll catch up with him.

262
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,460
Chuxi,

263
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,860
I feel like I owe you an apology.

264
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,900
What do you mean by that?

265
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,380
I've always wondered

266
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,380
if you'll lose yourself after coming here.

267
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,430
Honestly, my curiosity feels a bit selfish.

268
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,990
But when you really come here one day

269
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:49,020
and stand here,

270
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,980
I suddenly feel afraid.

271
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,310
I'm wondering

272
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,900
if it would be better if you could

273
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,610
live your life peacefully and contentedly.

274
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,350
You'd avoid meeting bad people and troubles.

275
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,260
I think,

276
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,950
facing those people and troubles,

277
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,550
I have to overcome them one by one.

278
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:16,140
Looking back at my own journey,

279
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,310
haven't I overcome all of them too?

280
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,660
Everyone dreams of a stable life.

281
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,380
But whether we get one or not,

282
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,590
that's up to fate.

283
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,110
All we can do is face it bravely

284
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,660
and take responsibility for ourselves.

285
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,500
That's enough.

286
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,460
Alright.

287
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,350
Let's face it together.

288
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:45,070
We'll fulfill Dad's last wish together

289
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,310
and protect this land.

290
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,700
Exactly.

291
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:50,830
Fulfill Dad's last wish

292
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:53,310
and protect this land.

293
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,350
The first time I saw you, you were a kid.

294
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,140
I never expected

295
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,350
you've grown up so much.

296
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:30,780
I didn't expect you to age so much either.

297
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,660
How do you plan to avenge Li Chengqian?

298
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:38,140
Still sticking to your ridiculous principles?

299
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,230
Didn't I tell you before?

300
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:43,020
When I grow up, I'd come back to beat you up.

301
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,980
I always keep my word.

302
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:47,510
My name is Zhao Chuxi.

303
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,660
When I grow up, I'll beat you up.

304
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,020
Sharp-tongued as ever.

305
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:57,230
Alright, let me put it bluntly.

306
00:14:57,580 --> 00:15:00,590
You'd better know when to stop.

307
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,710
Or I'll personally deal with you.

308
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,980
Our Sanjiang Group is about

309
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,750
to participate in the competition

310
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,620
for the largest cultural tourism project
of Jia City.

311
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:38,660
I know you've been preparing

312
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:40,710
for this project for many years.

313
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:44,620
But what if your profit-driven shareholders

314
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,310
find out you couldn't win the bid?

315
00:15:48,110 --> 00:15:49,860
Would they all pull out?

316
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,660
And when that happens,

317
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,190
won't your gamble completely fail?

318
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,380
Also, I'm not here for revenge.

319
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,230
I'm here to expose your crimes.

320
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,660
Let the public see your ugly true face.

321
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,660
Kid,

322
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,020
are you challenging me to a duel?

323
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:13,990
If you want, I can make it official.

324
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:16,550
Alright, I'll take it.

325
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:20,380
But if you lose then,

326
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,710
I might give you a chance.

327
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,710
If you're willing to kneel and beg me...

328
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,140
Not sure who'll end up kneeling though.

329
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,670
Come in.

330
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,140
Dad, you called me?

331
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:56,060
(Chen Tao)

332
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,300
(Huang Tu)

333
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,260
This is the Sanjiang Group's personnel file?

334
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:08,860
You and Guan Yue go handle this Huang Tu.

335
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,670
But Huang Tu seems to be

336
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,620
one of Sanjiang Group's core veterans.

337
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,910
Probably not easy to deal with, right?

338
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:19,030
Remember my words.

339
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,620
Human nature is always ugly.

340
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,990
In the face of benefits,

341
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,950
anything can be betrayed.

342
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:28,420
It just depends on the offer.

343
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,110
Don't worry about it.

344
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,460
Guan Yue will assist you with this task.

345
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,470
Got it, Dad.

346
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,870
- I'll handle it.
- Go ahead.

347
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,220
Zhao Chuxi,

348
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,590
you're too inexperienced to fight against me.

349
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,180
(From Chen Tao. Waiting at the staircase.
Need to talk.)

350
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:21,150
Why can't

351
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:23,070
Chen Tao just say it over the phone?

352
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,550
Always so mysterious.

353
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,060
Chen?

354
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,700
Mr. Chen?

355
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:58,260
Who's there?

356
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,460
Stop right there.

357
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:11,220
Mr. Huang Tu.

358
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,940
We've led you here so far away.

359
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,270
It's because this place is secluded.

360
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:18,580
No outsiders will interrupt us.

361
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,900
How about having a proper talk?

362
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:26,990
Mr. Zhang.

363
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,830
No, Mr. Xu.

364
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:33,590
Seems you don't know me well.

365
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,110
I don't blame you.

366
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:37,460
It's fine, there's time ahead.

367
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,750
Since we've started dealing with each other,

368
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:40,940
later on,

369
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,420
I'll make sure you truly know me.

370
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,380
Since you are personally involved,

371
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:51,790
you're not trying to bribe me, are you?

372
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,550
Dealing with clever people feels good.

373
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,230
But you've found the wrong person.

374
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,700
Now that you're here,

375
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,420
why not hear what I can offer?

376
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,350
Since you found me,

377
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,180
I assume you've done your research.

378
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:13,830
I'm someone who stands alone,

379
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:15,170
with no ties or attachments.

380
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:18,670
And the thing I despise the most

381
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:20,420
is shady dealings done in the dark.

382
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,780
You'd better find someone else.

383
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,220
Wait, Huang Tu.

384
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,590
Meet this person first,

385
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,270
and then make a decision.

386
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,220
Mr. Chen?

387
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,420
How could you betray the group?

388
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,860
Don't say such words so casually.

389
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:42,030
I've seen the true nature of things.

390
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,060
What true nature?

391
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,510
Zhao Chuxi has personal motives.

392
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,900
He's fighting this business war

393
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,310
with Sanjiang's fate.

394
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:51,990
If he loses,

395
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,830
Sanjiang Group will cease to exist.

396
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:55,900
The reason why he dared to do so

397
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:58,900
is that Sanjiang wasn't his creation.

398
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,620
We've been with the group for years.

399
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,110
His actions leave us in a tough spot.

400
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,940
Huang Tu,

401
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,550
I called you here today,

402
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,420
not to win you over,

403
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,960
and definitely not to bribe you.

404
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,830
I want you to see the situation clearly.

405
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,940
Of course, I hope you can cooperate.

406
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,750
This cooperation

407
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:21,310
will earn you five million as a reward.

408
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,620
So, what do you think?

409
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,460
You can rest assured.

410
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,990
My father promised,

411
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,940
as long as you don't oppose Zhang's Group

412
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:33,220
and return to Sanjiang,

413
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,270
there will be no harm to your group.

414
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,700
Chen Tao,

415
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,070
if it's for the group,

416
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,860
I can consider it.

417
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,510
But the reward...

418
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,590
The reward

419
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:50,030
can be doubled.

420
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:55,620
I'll consider it.

421
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,300
Mr. Chen.

422
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,750
By the way, Mr. Chen,

423
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,750
I'm really curious.

424
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:17,990
What terms did my father offer you?

425
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,030
Take down Zhao Chuxi

426
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,650
and make me become the chairman.

427
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,860
And I get 40% of the shares.

428
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:27,380
40%?

429
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,590
You have quite the appetite.

430
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,910
Mr. Xu,

431
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,900
that's because you don't know

432
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,700
what he stands to gain if he fails.

433
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:38,950
Gain what?

434
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:42,350
First, Zhao Chuxi won't know he was betrayed.

435
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,140
Second, he'll still get 20 million in cash.

436
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,550
That's called a well-prepared battle.

437
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,510
Impressive.

438
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,270
But Mr. Chen, aren't you worried

439
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,860
Huang Tu might betray you?

440
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:56,910
Not at all.

441
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,990
I've recorded everything.

442
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,950
If Zhao Chuxi finds out,

443
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,460
I'll turn the tables on him.

444
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:06,350
Who do you think Zhao Chuxi will trust?

445
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,740
Impressive.

446
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,380
I've learned from this.

447
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:14,890
Furong.

448
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,490
Arrange a meeting
with Cultural Tourism Group.

449
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,460
I need to understand the entire project.

450
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,230
Of course.

451
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:23,110
We also need to introduce them our proposal.

452
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,780
- Okay.
- Mr. Zhao,

453
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,220
I'll handle this.

454
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,860
Alright.

455
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,110
Then you set up the meeting.

456
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,750
Alright, I'll do it now.

457
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,460
You're about to meet Zhao Chuxi.

458
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,510
Did you remember everything I told you?

459
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,380
I remember.

460
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:44,180
Good, then go ahead.

461
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,710
Alright.

462
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:46,630
Let's go.

463
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,060
Here, Mr. Li.

464
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:59,180
Mr. Li, this is Mr. Zhao from Sanjiang Group.

465
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,270
Nice to meet you, Mr. Li.

466
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,390
Nice to meet you, Mr. Zhao.

467
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:03,060
- Please, come in.
- Please.

468
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,710
Mr. Zhao, this is

469
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,670
Mr. Li from the Cultural Tourism Group.

470
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:09,180
Mr. Li is overseeing this bidding project.

471
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,340
Mr. Li,

472
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:14,350
welcome to Sanjiang Group for research.

473
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:17,540
Our group has gained considerable experience

474
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,230
in the tourism operation and promotion.

475
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,580
Projects such as Beigu Town and Bihai Villa

476
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:23,900
that have attracted high attention recently

477
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,990
are all the result of our efforts.

478
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,700
(Content)
Since you are so experienced,

479
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:37,030
could you share some marketing strategies

480
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,470
regarding the Spark Tourism Zone?

481
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,110
Personally, my idea is,

482
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,820
to leverage local historical figures,

483
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,580
and create a compelling story around them.

484
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:47,620
Mr. Zhao,

485
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,220
are you looking for me?

486
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:53,340
Furong, I feel this cultural tourism project

487
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,110
is progressing too smoothly.

488
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,350
There must be something fishy about it.

489
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,430
Can you secretly look into it for me

490
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,850
and see if there's really an issue?

491
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:04,830
- Hello?
- Hello?

492
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:05,820
Xu Shaoqing,

493
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,260
Zhao Chuxi has already asked Furong

494
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,910
to investigate the Cultural Tourism Group.

495
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,100
Make arrangements right away,

496
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,540
and make sure I'm not exposed.

497
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,460
Alright,

498
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,060
don't worry about the rest.

499
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:17,110
We just want Sanjiang Group to exit Jia City.

500
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,620
Now it's no longer about whether it

501
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,030
can leave Jia City or not.

502
00:25:21,030 --> 00:25:22,820
If you don't handle this properly,

503
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,030

I'm a representative of Sanjiang Group.

I'm here to deliver a document to Mr. Li.

513

Mr. Li is currently in a meeting.

514
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:23,590
You can hand it over to me.

515
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,150
Thanks.

your company has always been

519
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,900
an industry leader in Jia City.

520
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,790
The proposal you wrote is truly impressive.

521
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:56,220
Thank you for the compliment, Mr. Gao.

522
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,660
May I ask you something else?

523
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,310
How are things going with Sanjiang Group?

524
00:27:01,510 --> 00:27:02,860
I'm not too sure about this either.

525
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,030
They still haven't submitted their proposal.

526
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,230
I spoke with Mr. Huang from Sanjiang Group

527
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,350
over the phone yesterday.

528
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,220
They have some internal issues.

529
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:14,580
They've decided not to participate this time.

530
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:20,340
I heard recently that Sanjiang Group

531
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,030
is facing a severe financial crisis.

532
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,180
It's truly regrettable.

533
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,580
Initially, I thought

534
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:32,510
we could compete in this collaboration.

535
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,830
If Sanjiang Group chooses to withdraw,

536
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:38,350
I hope we can sign with you quickly.

Dad, the cultural tourism project

541
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,940
should be firmly in our grasp.

you must finish them off.

00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,030
Take a look at me.

560
00:28:45,470 --> 00:28:46,340
Come on, buddy.

561
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:47,510
Give me a close-up, come on.

562
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,620
Has he come to visit me? No.

563
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,950
Do you know about what he said?

564
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:51,870
No, I don't.

565
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,270
Financial news report.

566
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:57,550
Huang Tu resigned from Sanjiang Group

567
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,340
and signed a strategic partnership
with Zhang Shengbai.

568
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,380
Sanjiang Group's leadership changed sides.

569
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,670
Partners broke contracts.

570
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:05,670
Does this signify that

571
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,930
the business war between Sanjiang Group

572
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,650
and Zhang's Group has ended in failure?

573
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:14,180
How does it feel to be under attack,
Zhao Chuxi?

574
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,860
Do you want to know

575
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,420
why so many people broke their contracts?

576
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,350
Why is that?

577
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,300
Because I want you to understand,

578
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,340
even if you lead a group,

579
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,590
you still can't escape your fate.

580
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:34,110
A small figure remains insignificant.

581
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,590
You'll never shape the big picture.

582
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:44,540
I will gradually and slowly

583
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,900
make you feel the despair.

584
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,420
Enjoy

585
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,660
your final moments in life.

586
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,220
Have some hot congee to warm your stomach.

587
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:58,140
Plain congee with goji berries.

588
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,040
I have to admit,

589
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,580
your mental resilience is truly impressive.

590
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,750
Absolutely.

591
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,140
As a chess player,

592
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:09,990
I'm about to make the final move,

593
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,940
which is also the most critical one.

594
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:14,180
Sis, are you ready for this?

595
00:30:27,190 --> 00:30:28,110
Come in.

596
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,140
Mr. Zhang, the cultural tourism project

597
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,300
has signed with another company.

598
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,030
Which company is it?

599
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,510
Zhenbei Group and Bajiu Group.

600
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,070
Zhenbei Group?

601
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,220
From Bei City?

602
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,310
They're doing business in Jia City.

603
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,310
Who's their boss?

604
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:57,700
Their secret bosses are Qingyi and Lin Sanwu.

605
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,990
Our price was higher than theirs.

606
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:02,510
That's why we lost the bid this time.

607
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:08,830
What a clever move!

608
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,820
They managed to shift our focus

609
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,460
toward Zhao Chuxi.

610
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,750
As a result,

611
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:22,380
he was just a pawn crossing the river.

612
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,430
Hello, everyone.

613
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:27,440
(Sanjiang Group received investment)
I'm Li Qingyi, daughter of Li Chengqian.

614
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,190
(from Li's Group and Lin's Group)
I now officially announce,

615
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:33,860
we shall invest in Sanjiang Group
together with Lin's Group,

616
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:36,940
and we will collaborate to develop

617
00:31:37,190 --> 00:31:39,030
the cultural tourism project in Jia City.

618
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:42,990
Next, I will formally reveal to everyone

619
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:45,180
(Li Chengqian's daughter)
that how Zhang's Group

620
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,380
(exposed Zhang's Group's crimes)
took all the group's benefits

621
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:49,590
from my father

622
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:53,660
and expose the crimes of Zhang's Group.

623
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,140
Li Qingyi.

624
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,030
Zhao Chuxi.

625
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,510
(From today, the Lin Family in Bei City)

626
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:05,300
(will officially merge into Sanjiang Group,)

627
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,990
(creating a huge stir in the business world.)

628
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:11,340
(Li Chengqian's daughter, Li Qingyi,)

629
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,030
(revealed the countless crimes
of Zhang's Group.)

630
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,140
Mr. Zhao, during this period,

631
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,790
I've found out some people
disloyal to the group.

632
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,790
You've worked hard lately.

633
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,750
You still have to deal with Mr. Xu.

634
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,260
It's my duty.
