Mr. Mouth.

5
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:47,715
Yes, boss.

Collect all the essays
that Kang Yo-seop has published

7
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:53,429
from his studies in Germany until now

8
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:58,893
and the essays his graduate students wrote
at Samguk University.

9
00:00:58,976 --> 00:01:00,186
Yes, boss.

11
00:01:08,402 --> 00:01:09,236
Wait a minute.

12
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,488
Are you done planning already?

13
00:01:11,155 --> 00:01:12,114
That was so fast.

14
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:13,908
I knew no one could be as fast as you.

15
00:01:21,373 --> 00:01:22,208
My dad

16
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,335
died in an accident.

17
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,546
It was an accident.

18
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,341
What do you mean he's a victim?

19
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:32,843
Tell me the truth.

20
00:01:33,636 --> 00:01:34,804
Why is he a victim?

21
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:37,306
Huh?

22
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:41,519
Why is his picture up here?

23
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,063
Say something.

24
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:45,397
Come on.

25
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:48,275
Tell me the truth, Yun Yi-rang!

26
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:49,902
Why is he a victim?

27
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:55,699
If I were to tell you,
would you be able to handle it?

28
00:01:58,869 --> 00:02:01,038
Cut the bullshit and tell me the truth.

29
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:08,337
My fa…

30
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:12,007
My father…

31
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:15,761
Was he really murdered?

32
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:18,597
Yes.

33
00:02:47,293 --> 00:02:49,211
Gu-ho, listen to me.

34
00:02:49,295 --> 00:02:51,005
You should've told me!

35
00:02:52,131 --> 00:02:54,049
You should've told me, James!

36
00:02:56,677 --> 00:02:58,053
I had no choice.

37
00:02:58,721 --> 00:03:00,848
At first, I didn't know
what the truth was.

38
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:03,267
I meant to tell you later,
but I missed my chance.

39
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,060
Missed your chance? That's nonsense.

40
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,479
Five years. Get it?

41
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:10,316
We spent five years together.
And you're saying you meant to tell me?

42
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,946
Why do you think we didn't tell you?

43
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:25,581
Seriously.

44
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:27,875
Do you know what's really absurd?

45
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:30,002
The two…

46
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,671
The two people I trusted the most

47
00:03:33,756 --> 00:03:34,798
knew how

48
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:37,718
my dad died,

49
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,512
yet they never told me. You know that?

50
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,932
It's all my fault.

51
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:44,808
-It was my idea.
-Enough with your excuses!

52
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:47,353
That's why she's always like that.

53
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:48,562
-Gu-ho!
-What?

54
00:03:48,646 --> 00:03:50,105
What do you mean, I'm always like that?

55
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:55,361
Why?

56
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:58,906
What's wrong with me?

57
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,574
Hey.

58
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,954
Even now, your feelings
are what matter most, aren't they?

59
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:06,121
Yes.

60
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,290
See?

61
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:10,376
You can't handle it. Am I wrong?

62
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:12,836
Whether I can handle it or not,
it's up to me.

63
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:14,797
Then you should be thankful.

64
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,469
The murderer who killed your father.

65
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,389
I'm the one who found him.

66
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,061
Thankful?

67
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:32,773
I should be thankful?

68
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,943
Wow.

69
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,196
You know what?

70
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,823
I can't thank you enough.

71
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,868
Thank you for finding the culprit
who killed my dad.

72
00:04:45,703 --> 00:04:49,081
Thank you for pretending to be a team.

73
00:04:49,164 --> 00:04:50,416
Thank you for everything.

74
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:55,045
I'll take revenge for my dad now.
Don't worry about it.

75
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,466
-Myung Gu-ho.
-Don't.

76
00:05:02,511 --> 00:05:03,971
Don't ever say my name again.

77
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,015
Gu-ho.

1 MONTH LATER

80
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:30,122
That incident happened in April 2000?

81
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:31,540
Yes.

82
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:35,002
Do you think it can be reinvestigated?

83
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:38,422
You should've rushed.

84
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:40,215
Sorry?

85
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:44,136
Are you aware that the statute
of limitations for murder cases

86
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:47,514
was abolished completely on July 24, 2015?

87
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:52,394
If that happened in April 2000,
that law doesn't apply.

88
00:05:52,478 --> 00:05:55,189
So, the murderer won't be punished.

00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:35,646
I'm leaving now.

00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,573
Do you have to go?

92
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:52,079
It's kind of tough for me
after Gu-ho left.

93
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,544
Give me some time.

94
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:01,630
Take care.

95
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:15,894

KANG YO-SEOP

100
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:36,456
If the suspect stayed abroad

101
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,959
for an extended period
to evade punishment,

102
00:07:39,042 --> 00:07:41,670
or if an accomplice is prosecuted,

103
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:44,214
the statute of limitations is suspended.

104
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:48,177
In that case,
the case may be reinvestigated.

Manager Gu!

109
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,086
Geez, why do you keep doing that
with your head?

110
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:26,131
I wonder what you were looking at
so seriously.

111
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:29,718
You need to make a sound
or knock at least, seriously.

112
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:31,470
We're out of ramyeon.

113
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:33,805
You might as well buy raw noodles.

114
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:37,935
Gosh, I've been getting
high blood sugar levels.

115
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:38,852
You know what?

116
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,647
You need to stop eating ramyeon.

117
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,274
Do you know how delicious ramyeon is?

118
00:08:44,358 --> 00:08:48,946
Isn't it too cruel
to steal the joy of eating

119
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,781
from a man who's near death?

120
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,242
Who's near death?

121
00:08:53,325 --> 00:08:55,118
Didn't you say

122
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:58,497
your upper body muscles
were at 120 percent in your last checkup?

123
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,291
You were cursing at me that death

124
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,086
always comes too late or too early.
Whatever.

125
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:06,922
You've got a good memory
for a country boy.

126
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,715
What makes you say that I'm a country boy?

127
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:12,302
I can tell from A to Z.

128
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,805
I'm sophisticated from A to Z.
How am I a country boy?

129
00:09:14,888 --> 00:09:19,726
Look, you only eat white rice.
That makes you a country boy.

130
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,229
That's because that's the rule here.

131
00:09:22,312 --> 00:09:25,148
Mix grains or beans.

132
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,233
Look, old man.

133
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,236
A mere manager
doesn't have the power to do that.

134
00:09:29,319 --> 00:09:30,320
No, leave me alone.

135
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:33,031
How can you be so inflexible?

136
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:37,077
-Geez!
-He's sullen.

137
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,956
Do you want to go for a walk after dinner?

138
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,041
A walk after a meal helps with diabetes.

139
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,835
Whatever.

140
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:47,546
My goodness.

141
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,590
He needs to pay his overdue charges first.

142
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:52,217
He's acting like he owns this place.

143
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,265
So, they're hiring.

144
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,062
Excuse me, Manager Gu.

145
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,647
-Yes.
-You know what?

146
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:08,150
Know what? Are we out of toilet paper?

147
00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:11,236
No, my side dishes keep disappearing.

148
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,613
-Side dishes?
-Yes.

149
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:16,283
I knew something was weird.

150
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:17,659
Your side dishes disappear, too?

151
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:21,288
The gat-kimchi my mom sent me
the other day. It's almost empty.

152
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,957
I think you just don't remember it
after drinking.

153
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:24,916
Is that it?

154
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,793
No, wait, look at this.

155
00:10:27,377 --> 00:10:30,088
This is the number of sausages,

156
00:10:30,589 --> 00:10:34,051
and this is the number of quail eggs.
I counted them all.

157
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:36,011
-You took photos of them?
-Yes. You know me.

158
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:37,054
-Who are you?
-Me.

159
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:39,139
-Okay.
-Yes, look.

160
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:44,061
Three pieces of sausage in the center,
and two eggs in the corner.

161
00:10:45,103 --> 00:10:46,271
I can't tell.

162
00:10:46,355 --> 00:10:47,356
What do you mean?

163
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:50,484
Could it be the new resident in Room 207…

164
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:54,154
-Oh, seriously.
-Why do you suspect an innocent man?

165
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:56,865
Don't you know
the presumption of innocence?

166
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:58,950
Oh, Gu-ho.

167
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:01,161
After visiting some law firms,

168
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:04,164
you've become smart enough
to become a law firm manager.

169
00:11:04,247 --> 00:11:05,791
I'm saying, don't suspect anyone.

170
00:11:05,874 --> 00:11:07,084
-No.
-No?

171
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,627
-No.
-What do you mean no?

172
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,797
I think this started
when Mr. Yeom moved in.

173
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,385
Right. I mean, that man looks creepy
when I say hi.

174
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:18,804
Hello.

175
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:24,726
Both of you, don't judge someone
based on their appearance, okay?

176
00:11:24,810 --> 00:11:27,979
Judging by appearance, you two
are the creepiest and the most suspicious.

177
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:28,897
Move.

178
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:32,442
-Manager Gu, you're so eloquent.
-Of course, I am.

179
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:37,489
Gu-ho, by the way, I heard a pretty girl
moved in on the women's floor.

180
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:41,535
Stop minding that
and focus on your teacher's exam.

181
00:11:41,618 --> 00:11:43,578
Didn't you say you failed
many times already?

182
00:11:43,662 --> 00:11:45,414
What does that have to do with this?

183
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:48,166
Also, if there's any good information,
we should share it, you know.

184
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,626
I don't know what you mean.

185
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:51,169
Gu-ho.

186
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,090
Catching the side dish thief is your duty.

187
00:11:55,173 --> 00:11:57,717
-You must catch him. I mean it.
-Manager Gu.

188
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:01,596
These quail eggs
could cause an uproar here.

189
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,473
You must think carefully. Okay?

190
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:06,643
Okay.

191
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,870
One more bottle of soju, please.

192
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:15,253
Gosh, are you just drinking
soju again today?

193
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,800
Since this dish is on me,

194
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:23,136
can I dip into your liquor?

195
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:37,108
Oh, thank you.

196
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,867
Are you coming from somewhere?

197
00:13:54,626 --> 00:13:56,419
You look like

198
00:13:56,503 --> 00:14:00,590
you're carrying the weight of the world,

199
00:14:00,674 --> 00:14:03,385
a lot more than your usual self.

200
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:07,847
But I won't ask what's going on.

201
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:11,142
You're curious, but you won't ask?

202
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:15,689
I mean, most of my customers
have that look on their faces.

203
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,400
But, you know what?
Their reasons are obvious.

204
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:22,237
They're too lonely to carry on,
or their friends stabbed them in the back,

205
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,655
or they got dumped,

206
00:14:24,239 --> 00:14:26,700
or they miss their late parents.

207
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,828
Well, I get that if you miss your mom.

208
00:14:32,789 --> 00:14:35,917
Let's cut the cliché and just drink.

209
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:37,502
No?

210
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:42,799
Or if it's something intense
like a shocking affair,

211
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,634
I'm willing to listen.

212
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:48,930
What's she trying to pull?

213
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,515
What else?

214
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,559
This is highly sophisticated comfort.

215
00:14:53,351 --> 00:14:54,436
Right.

216
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,938
Strangely enough, it's comforting.

217
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:01,234
You're a dangerous person.

218
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,320
Yes, well…

219
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:07,032
I get that a lot.

220
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:10,160
So?

221
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:12,746
If you're thankful, how about a toast?

222
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:14,956
If I make a toast,

223
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:18,835
do I get to listen to your affair?

224
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,422
Maybe?

225
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:30,889
SPRING NIGHT POCHA

226
00:15:45,403 --> 00:15:48,073
The world's biggest oil company,
ANK's head,

227
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:51,868
Abdullah de Juju, is entering
the conference room under heavy guard.

228
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:04,756
Chairwoman Jeong Su-jin of Mopis Motors
has just arrived.

229
00:16:04,839 --> 00:16:07,342
Then Chairman Ju Chan-jin of Hanko Bio,

230
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,344
who had rumors about his health issues,
has arrived.

231
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:11,971
I also see Chairman An Tae-ho
of Samjin Group.

232
00:16:15,892 --> 00:16:19,312
That is Lawyer Lee Na-ra,
the acting CEO of Jay Fund International.

233
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:26,069
The movement of Jay Fund,
which holds the largest assets in Korea,

234
00:16:26,152 --> 00:16:30,699
is a clear example
of the scale of this investment.

235
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:35,495
Can you briefly tell us
about the Mega Eco City

236
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:37,330
that Abdullah wants to build
in the desert?

237
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:42,419
The highlight of this project is to build
an eco-friendly city in the desert

238
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,796
for four million people to reside.

239
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:47,173
How big is the size of construction

240
00:16:47,257 --> 00:16:50,343
that all corporation heads
have gathered for it?

241
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,554
Based on my company's analysis,

242
00:16:52,637 --> 00:16:55,306
we came to an agreement that
when this project is completed,

243
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:59,769
at least 30 trillion won in profit
could be made depending on the design.

244
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:03,815
That is way over the estimation
that was first released to the media.

245
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,817
What's your ground for that?

246
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,236
Several years ago,

247
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,281
my company already received a consultation
on the possibility of the business.

248
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,198
KANG YO-SEOP

249
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:15,243
The people are expecting a second boom
in the Middle East.

250
00:17:15,869 --> 00:17:17,370
Do you think this is drawing near?

251
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:18,663
Of course.

252
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:22,333
Building a new type of city
in the vast desert

253
00:17:22,417 --> 00:17:25,253
is probably the dream of people
in Korea's construction field

254
00:17:25,336 --> 00:17:28,757
who have already experienced
the Middle East boom in the '70s and '80s.

CEO KANG YO-SEOP

261
00:18:58,179 --> 00:18:59,055
Okay.

262
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:00,557
Bye.

263
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:05,562
Sorry about that.

264
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:10,400
Can you show me the applicants' essays?

265
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:13,027
You should leave that to us.

266
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,904
You barely have time
to get sleep these days.

267
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:18,366
You can do everything else,

268
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:20,410
but leave this for me to handle.

269
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:23,454

00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:53,276
Do you want to see the résumé?

277
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:54,611
Oh, yes.

KIM A-REUM

279
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:03,202
Number 217 Kim A-reum, please come in.

280
00:20:07,373 --> 00:20:10,084
KIM A-REUM

281
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,343
You went to college in Germany.

282
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:24,307
The essay you submitted looked humane
and warm to me.

283
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,601
Why did you name it dystopia?

284
00:20:31,606 --> 00:20:32,690
To me,

285
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:38,321
people living in the city called utopia
didn't seem happy.

286
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:43,451
Then I must challenge
the minds of its creators

287
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:47,830
in order to build a city
where the residents can be truly happy.

288
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:53,044
That's quite antithetical.

289
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:55,964
So, what's your idea of utopia?

290
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:59,008
No, tell me your idea of dystopia.

291
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,344
Can you summarize it in one sentence?

292
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,015
I thought of an alley in the '80s

293
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,892
where people ate, mingled,

294
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,104
and loved each other
with a community spirit.

295
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:17,110
Thank you for that.

296
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,861
Thank you.

297
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,697
You can leave now.

298
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:30,665
Hide tight, I can see your hair.

299
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,503
Kang Yo-seop, it's your turn to hide now.

300
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:39,716
She looks familiar.

301
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:41,968
Where did I see her?

302
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:57,483
Hey!

303
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,548
Why don't you just go talk to him?

304
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,094
Once we begin the operation,
just the two of us won't be enough.

305
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,442
-How's Gu-ho doing?
-Don't bother worrying about him.

306
00:22:39,525 --> 00:22:41,402
He looked more comfortable there.

307
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:44,614
That's typical of Gu-ho.

308
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:52,705
-Hello?
-Is this Kim A-reum?

309
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:54,457
-Yes.
-This is to inform you that

310
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,958
you weren't hired by Josef Architects.

311
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,087
We're sorry. Try again next time.

312
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,505
Okay.

313
00:23:04,175 --> 00:23:05,760
What? How did it go?

314
00:23:07,637 --> 00:23:08,971
I didn't make it.

00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:31,953
The Korean government will not
be satisfied with the 17 MOUs we signed

318
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:34,872
with the Middle East oil company, ANK,
that visited Korea.

319
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:37,208
In order to win
the construction turnkey contract,

320
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,876
the government will play the key role

321
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,504
in creating the Mega Eco City supporters.

322
00:23:42,547 --> 00:23:46,676
Create the Mega Eco City supporters
and export the city model?

323
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,221
…a remarkable accomplishment
by exporting a city model,

324
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:53,266
and promise to provide a basis
to raise our country's economy.

00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:22,021
I love it.

Hello, I'm Kim A-reum.

347
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,181
I just want to know why I didn't make it.

348
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,667
That painting…

349
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,463
You finally got your hands on it.

350
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:38,973
Oh, I meant I saw that painting
at the art gallery, too.

351
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,274
And did you come to my lecture?

352
00:26:48,357 --> 00:26:49,775
Of course, I did.

353
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,861
No wonder you looked familiar.

354
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:58,326
By the way, isn't that painting
somewhat bizarre?

355
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,369
On a moonlit night,

356
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:04,707
the dark shadows are walking
toward the same place.

357
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:11,297
As if they want to escape
from the reality they're in.

358
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:14,550
Just like you.

359
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:21,474
Oh, don't take it wrong.

360
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:23,726
I just read your autobiographies
multiple times.

361
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,647
You want to know
why you didn't get the job?

362
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,278
Yes, I don't quite get it.

363
00:27:34,362 --> 00:27:37,865
I collected and researched
all the information on you.

364
00:27:37,948 --> 00:27:41,077
And I thought
I submitted an assignment you'd like.

365
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,579
That's the reason I didn't hire you.

366
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,082
What?

367
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:51,212
I admit that your qualifications
excelled other applicants.

368
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:52,129
But,

369
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:57,676
I came to the decision that only one
Kang Yo-seop was needed in my company.

370
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,100
I'm pretty sure you know what that means.

371
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:07,395
You should leave now.

372
00:28:07,478 --> 00:28:08,687
Wait.

373
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,690
I can't give up like this.

374
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:16,237
I went to study in Germany because of you.
And I'm working hard every day.

375
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,614
-Please give me one more chance.
-Kim A-reum, first--

376
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:19,949
On contract.

377
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:23,160
I don't mind working on a contract.
Please let me learn next to you.

378
00:28:28,749 --> 00:28:30,668
I understand your passion.

379
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:32,503
You should go home now.

380
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,173
Okay.

381
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:49,812
That's enough for the test.

382
00:28:55,484 --> 00:28:58,070
Are you happy that I came to you
just as you wanted?

383
00:28:58,696 --> 00:29:01,699
I enjoyed your petty test.

384
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:08,372
Come to my office starting tomorrow

385
00:29:08,914 --> 00:29:10,499
if you're okay with working on a contract.

386
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,005
Kang Yo-seop.

387
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,048
This is only the beginning.

388
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:23,762
We need to go over the design on page 32.

389
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,514
-Check on that.
-Yes, sir.

390
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:27,183
And on page 128.

391
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:28,726
The graph isn't clear enough.

392
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:31,604
-Adjust the size and the color.
-Okay.

393
00:29:31,687 --> 00:29:34,690
That's Ms. Kim A-reum.
She'll be working with us starting today.

394
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,026
-Hi.
-Hello, I'm Kim A-reum.

395
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:39,111
Nice to meet you.
I look forward to learning a lot.

396
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:42,573
A-reum, sorry to ask you
when you just got here,

397
00:29:42,656 --> 00:29:43,824
but can you copy this?

398
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:45,451
Sure. How many copies do you need?

399
00:29:45,534 --> 00:29:46,744
-Twelve copies.
-Okay.

400
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,622
Wait, can you tell me
where the copy machine is?

401
00:29:49,705 --> 00:29:51,624
Just go straight down this way.

402
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:58,714
Sang-hui, I'm here.

403
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:01,175
Sang-hui?

404
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,557
When are you going to stop doing this?

405
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,646
You just have to suck the life
out of me, don't you?

406
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:16,065
Cut your bullshit. I could just…

407
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:20,486
-Eun-u.
-What the hell are you doing?

408
00:30:20,569 --> 00:30:22,821
Who are you to make a ruckus here?

409
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:27,076
Me? My life was ruined
because of that bitch.

410
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:29,703
Let go.

411
00:30:29,787 --> 00:30:30,913
I said let go!

412
00:30:30,996 --> 00:30:32,373
Let go, for goodness' sake.

413
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:36,961
Damn, what a shitty day. Now this bastard…

414
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:44,218
I was about to leave anyway.

415
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,594
Get out of my way.

416
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:54,436
Hey.

417
00:30:55,938 --> 00:30:59,567
You'd better stay away from that bitch
before your life becomes hell.

418
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:03,279
Mark my words. Got it?

419
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,532
What a joke.

420
00:31:15,207 --> 00:31:17,626
I got pregnant unexpectedly

421
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:20,713
before college graduation.

422
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:26,218
He wasn't ready to become a father yet.

423
00:31:26,302 --> 00:31:28,804
Gambling and affairs…

424
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,266
Every time he ran out of money,
he destroyed everything he saw.

425
00:31:34,184 --> 00:31:35,853
Should I say I was lucky?

426
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:37,896
I had

427
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,400
a miscarriage.

428
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:04,340
Mr. Ray-Bang.

429
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,467
I need you to find someone.

430
00:32:09,011 --> 00:32:10,554
Sir, over here.

431
00:32:14,391 --> 00:32:15,267
This way.

432
00:32:15,351 --> 00:32:16,852
TIME TO FIND YOUR REAL PUNCH!

433
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,148
-Oh, good.
-Hey!

434
00:32:22,149 --> 00:32:23,776
Get over here, you bastard.

435
00:32:29,907 --> 00:32:30,741
What brings you here?

436
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:34,828
Good luck. You got this.

437
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:48,676
I heard you were rich.

438
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:52,304
You gave Ko Sang-hui 30 million won.
If I win, give me 70 million won.

439
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:56,016
But if I win,

440
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,019
don't ever get near Sang-hui again.

441
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,481
Good luck!

442
00:33:06,902 --> 00:33:09,988
Stretch your arms, yes. Guard up!

443
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:27,840
Guard!

444
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:29,216
Come on.

445
00:33:48,152 --> 00:33:52,406
EUN-U

446
00:33:55,868 --> 00:33:57,077
SANG-HUI

447
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:03,542
Hello?

448
00:34:03,625 --> 00:34:04,752
Eun-u.

449
00:34:04,835 --> 00:34:05,794
What? Who?

450
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:12,301
Oh, right. Eun-u is
at Two Punch Boxing Club right now.

451
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,218
What?

452
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:15,387
Where?

453
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:20,058
How is he going to beat a boxing champion?

454
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,144
Okay.

455
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:47,252
You don't even have the strength
to protect a woman.

456
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,508
Shut up, you punk.

457
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,427
This has only begun.

458
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:12,861
Eun-u!

459
00:35:21,912 --> 00:35:22,871
Sang-hui.

460
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:45,644
-Sir!
-Coach! Oh no.

461
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:52,359
Let me see.

462
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:57,114
You're hurt

463
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,241
because of me.

464
00:36:59,176 --> 00:37:01,845
Catching the side dish thief is your duty.

465
00:37:01,929 --> 00:37:03,138
You must catch him.

466
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,767
These quail eggs
could cause an uproar here.

467
00:37:14,066 --> 00:37:15,984
I thought you were sick
of working with us.

468
00:37:16,068 --> 00:37:18,028
Old habits die hard.

469
00:37:18,987 --> 00:37:21,448
Whatever. I'll do it my way.

470
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:57,025
ROOM 102

471
00:37:57,109 --> 00:37:58,819
ROOM 304

472
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,452
Gat-kimchi.

473
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:11,289
Two pieces…

474
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,501
of rolled omelet.

475
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,592
I knew my side dishes kept disappearing.

476
00:38:22,676 --> 00:38:25,721
Was it you all this time? You punk.

477
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:27,973
-Who is it?
-I'll kill you today.

478
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,768
Sir, let him go.

479
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:35,188
Geez, I get that you're upset,
but let's talk it out.

480
00:38:35,272 --> 00:38:40,110
Well, it's because you made
such a delicious rolled omelet.

481
00:38:40,193 --> 00:38:41,153
How can you say that?

482
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,530
You crazy old bastard!

483
00:38:52,789 --> 00:38:54,249
Oh, blood.

484
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,333
Get out of my way!

485
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,091
Why did you have to come forward?

486
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:04,509
Darn it.

487
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:16,104
Sir, are you okay?

488
00:39:16,772 --> 00:39:19,399
Hey! Call an ambulance!

489
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:23,195
Hello? We need you here right now.

490
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:33,080
Hi…

491
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:35,916
Sweetie.

492
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:42,589
I missed you.

493
00:39:42,672 --> 00:39:43,757
-I missed you, too.
-Let's go.

494
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:59,106
Why don't you just spar with him, too?

495
00:39:59,689 --> 00:40:01,024
They say you have to fight for love.

496
00:40:08,115 --> 00:40:10,742
Come on. Can't you tell?

497
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:11,952
She's a gold-digger.

498
00:40:12,035 --> 00:40:15,413
Ex-husband, ex-boyfriend,
and a new boyfriend.

499
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:22,587
Gosh, you scared me.

500
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:25,423
Anyway, what makes her so attractive?

501
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:29,177
Why do men keep chasing after her?

502
00:40:29,761 --> 00:40:32,806
Wait. What are you doing here?

503
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:34,766
Don't be embarrassed.

504
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:37,435
It's not wrong to fall in love.

505
00:40:39,938 --> 00:40:41,398
It's embarrassing. Stop it.

506
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:44,484
What's so embarrassing?

507
00:40:45,068 --> 00:40:47,237
That you let her rip off 30 million won,

508
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,947
or that you got beaten up
by her ex-husband?

509
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:50,615
I want to be alone today.

510
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,993
I won't let you.

511
00:40:53,076 --> 00:40:55,245
I found a perfect solution for you.

512
00:40:55,328 --> 00:40:56,538
Enough!

513
00:41:09,759 --> 00:41:11,469
It went up by 37 percent.

514
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:15,015
-What? It went up that much?
-Yes.

515
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:16,641
Yes?

516
00:41:18,852 --> 00:41:19,686
Sir.

517
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,272
How are you feeling?

518
00:41:22,355 --> 00:41:24,691
Oh, Manager Gu.

519
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:31,114
-How did you know I have a sweet tooth?
-Wait. I forgot that you have diabetes.

520
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:33,200
No, don't worry about that.

521
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,368
I'll save on it.

522
00:41:35,452 --> 00:41:36,828
Here. Have a seat.

523
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:39,039
Promise me you won't drink it all at once.

524
00:41:41,082 --> 00:41:42,751
-I will leave you two alone.
-Sure.

525
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:49,216
By the way, don't you think
this room is too nice?

526
00:41:49,299 --> 00:41:52,427
Oh, what's so nice about it?

527
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,512
I like our dorm better.

528
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,807
What are you talking about?
This is way more spacious than the dorm.

529
00:41:57,891 --> 00:41:59,601
Just because it's spacious,

530
00:42:00,185 --> 00:42:01,603
it doesn't mean it gives me peace.

531
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,272
One must be at peace, for sure.

532
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:06,983
Mr. Yeom got arrested, by the way.

533
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:09,694
-So, you don't need to worry.
-Okay.

534
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:13,490
Why did you steal someone else's
side dishes when you were so rich?

535
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,994
Exactly.

536
00:42:18,078 --> 00:42:20,580
It turns out to be dementia.

537
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:22,540
Dementia?

538
00:42:22,624 --> 00:42:25,126
Wait, you have dementia?

539
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,544
Well, they call it

540
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,131
sundown syndrome or something.

541
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:33,260
It's a type of dementia
that gets serious at night.

542
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:38,306
I didn't know I was stealing
other people's side dishes, either. Geez.

543
00:42:41,184 --> 00:42:42,560
No wonder

544
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:47,649
my clothes were dirty
every time I woke up.

545
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,946
Well, is it serious?

546
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:56,157
What? Are you worried that I'd die?

547
00:42:56,241 --> 00:43:01,913
Oh, stop talking about dying.

548
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:06,126
That's why I like you.

549
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:10,380
Liking someone is completely different
from torturing someone.

550
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:11,464
It's the same thing.

551
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:14,426
Like white shoes or blanc shoes.
White rice or blanc rice.

552
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:19,055
Let's cut to the chase.

553
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:26,104
Since you saved my life,

554
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,190
I'll grant you a wish.

555
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:34,487
Yes, sir.

556
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:42,537
Tell me anything you want.

557
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:02,349
It's been 13 days
since you've been working overtime.

558
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:04,184
I'm starving. When do you get off?

559
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:09,022
Just wait. I'm almost done.

560
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:11,149
Anyway, now that I'm back,
it's more fun, isn't it?

561
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,817
Of course.

562
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:15,737
There's no Yun Yi-rang without James.

563
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:16,738
Right?

564
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,991
It shows when I'm absent.

565
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:43,973
Come in.

566
00:44:58,530 --> 00:45:02,867
What brings you here at this hour?

567
00:45:02,951 --> 00:45:05,203
The Minister would like
to speak with you urgently.

568
00:45:05,870 --> 00:45:07,789
The Minister of Land, Infrastructure,
and Transport?

569
00:45:07,872 --> 00:45:09,749
May I connect you to him?

570
00:45:12,544 --> 00:45:14,170
This is Minister Yoo Sang-won.

571
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:19,801
He's talking to Yoo Sang-won on the phone.

572
00:45:19,884 --> 00:45:20,885
Yoo Sang-won?

573
00:45:21,428 --> 00:45:25,932
I called you to be the leader
of Mega Eco City supporters.

574
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:27,225
Why me?

575
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:30,186
Chairman Abdullah was impressed

576
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:32,063
by your consulting proposal.

577
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:34,274
He spoke highly of the idea
of applying a new city model

578
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:38,069
from the country of the miracle
on the Hangang River.

579
00:45:39,404 --> 00:45:40,780
Oh, is that so?

580
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,450
As long as you're okay,

581
00:45:43,533 --> 00:45:45,785
I'd like to speak with you in person.

582
00:45:46,578 --> 00:45:47,829
When will be a good time for you?

583
00:45:53,126 --> 00:45:55,753
Things are going just as we planned.

584
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:58,590
Gosh, something doesn't feel right.

585
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:00,049
What do you mean?

586
00:46:00,758 --> 00:46:03,094
The true reason Kang Yo-seop hired me.

587
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:06,139
Probably because you are skilled
and reliable?

588
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:07,098
No.

589
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,267
Kang Yo-seop had already sent

590
00:46:10,185 --> 00:46:14,647
the residence sample he created
with all his might to ANK

591
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:17,984
and the Minister of Land, Infrastructure,
and Transport.

592
00:46:18,067 --> 00:46:20,945
So, he didn't need my fake connection

593
00:46:21,029 --> 00:46:23,364
with the Minister Yoo
we wrote on our blog.

594
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:26,409
What could be his reason? Why?

595
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:28,995
Whatever he's thinking
will soon be revealed.

596
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:32,415
Just focus on
how to bring him down for now.

597
00:46:35,627 --> 00:46:36,503
Man…

598
00:46:47,263 --> 00:46:48,515
Come in.

599
00:46:59,484 --> 00:47:02,028
It's the data on the fractal
you requested.

600
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:10,662
Good.

601
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:12,455
Very nice.

602
00:47:14,332 --> 00:47:17,710
Would you be able to see
if there are any hanok examples

603
00:47:17,794 --> 00:47:22,924
and research how we can apply those
to the contemporary architecture?

604
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:24,926
Yes, sir.

605
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:33,977
So, you want to take advantage
of my genius brain endlessly?

606
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:36,563
Sure, I'm okay with that.

607
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:40,358
Because you'll slowly crumble
according to my plan.

608
00:47:43,069 --> 00:47:47,448
She'll be more useful than I expected.

609
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:52,161
Of course, she's useful.
I bet she's pretty useful.

610
00:47:52,954 --> 00:47:54,706
Be ready for it, you idiot.

611
00:48:03,631 --> 00:48:05,341
-A-reum, this, too.
-Oh, yes.

612
00:48:06,843 --> 00:48:07,677
Ms. Kim A-reum?

613
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:10,221
Yes, sir.

614
00:48:10,305 --> 00:48:11,848
I want you to come with me.

615
00:48:13,474 --> 00:48:15,226
Oh, okay.

616
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:28,740
Where is he taking you?

617
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:35,997
How do you like the job?

618
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:39,834
It's good. I'm doing my best to learn.

619
00:48:39,917 --> 00:48:41,461
Thank you for hiring me.

620
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:45,173
I wasn't expecting your lip service.

621
00:48:45,840 --> 00:48:47,175
It might look like no big deal,

622
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:49,594
but there's a huge difference
between working on site

623
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:51,471
and racking your brain
in front of the desk.

624
00:48:52,055 --> 00:48:54,140
Yes, I will do my best to learn.

625
00:48:56,476 --> 00:48:57,644
I like your passion.

626
00:49:00,772 --> 00:49:01,981
By the way,

627
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:05,526
may I ask where we're going right now?

628
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:14,327
I'm sure you'll like it there.

629
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:49,028
That bastard.

630
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:02,417
You can leave if you want to.

631
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:04,752
No, sir.

632
00:50:53,092 --> 00:50:54,218
Shit.

633
00:51:10,109 --> 00:51:11,319
Hello.

634
00:51:15,490 --> 00:51:16,324
Welcome.

635
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:17,909
Have a seat.

636
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:21,788
You're working hard day and night
for Korea's future.

637
00:51:21,871 --> 00:51:25,875
As the Minister of Land, Infrastructure,
and Transport, I can't thank you enough.

638
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:27,251
Especially Chief Kang Yo-seop.

639
00:51:28,336 --> 00:51:29,170
And Ms. A-reum.

640
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:34,091
I'm touched that you're all present here
while you're all busy.

641
00:51:34,175 --> 00:51:36,177
Touched, my foot.

642
00:51:38,137 --> 00:51:39,388
I mean,

643
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:45,770
we all know that we're here
for our own benefits.

644
00:51:45,853 --> 00:51:47,480
What's up with being pretentious?

645
00:51:48,689 --> 00:51:49,816
Is that so?

646
00:51:49,899 --> 00:51:52,068
For you, Minister,

647
00:51:52,151 --> 00:51:55,071
if this turns out well,
your ministry will not only take credit,

648
00:51:55,154 --> 00:51:59,534
but it'll also help raise
Mr. President's declining support.

649
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:02,203
This will benefit your political career
in the long run.

650
00:52:03,663 --> 00:52:05,998
For you, Chief Kang Yo-seop,

651
00:52:06,082 --> 00:52:09,877
this will be a chance
to make yourself known to the world.

652
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:14,257
Your expected profit
is obviously beyond imagination.

653
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:15,842
For me,

654
00:52:17,009 --> 00:52:19,887
if I build dozens of buildings
out of nowhere in the desert,

655
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:24,600
it'll be a freaking sweet way
to redeem our low domestic performance.

656
00:52:27,228 --> 00:52:29,313
Judging by your words,

657
00:52:29,397 --> 00:52:31,649
I shouldn't be joining
this project thoughtlessly.

658
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:33,609
Korea's future,

659
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:35,903
Oracle Engineering's future,

660
00:52:35,987 --> 00:52:38,114
and the future presidency
also depend on it.

661
00:52:38,656 --> 00:52:40,992
I knew this was a lot of pressure.

662
00:52:41,868 --> 00:52:44,370
But I will do my best
to prevent you from worrying.

663
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:47,832
-In that sense, how about a toast?
-Shall we?

664
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:49,876
I like your spirit.

665
00:52:49,959 --> 00:52:51,919
All right. Cheers.

666
00:52:58,593 --> 00:53:00,219
Please take good care of it.

667
00:53:00,303 --> 00:53:04,056
If you don't mind, please excuse me.

668
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:07,810
He has a meeting
for a carbon neutrality agreement.

669
00:53:07,894 --> 00:53:08,853
This way, sir.

670
00:53:18,237 --> 00:53:20,239
Just as the rumor says,
that young brat is impertinent.

671
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:22,074
You've been very patient, sir.

672
00:53:22,575 --> 00:53:24,118
It's all thanks to Chief Kang.

673
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:26,704
Chief Kang looks like a nice man.

674
00:53:26,787 --> 00:53:27,955
That's right.

675
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:47,558
Oh, hello. This way.

676
00:54:07,703 --> 00:54:08,663
By the way,

677
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:09,997
your secretary is pretty.

678
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:13,584
-Do you like champagne?
-No, I don't.

679
00:54:14,627 --> 00:54:16,128
Boss, if you'll excuse me.

680
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:20,216
Sir, this way.

681
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:26,180
Have a seat.

682
00:54:29,225 --> 00:54:31,894
This is Chairman Cho Man-bok of Jay Fund,

683
00:54:31,978 --> 00:54:35,064
who was willing to be in charge of finance
for this project.

684
00:54:37,775 --> 00:54:39,902
I never thought
this would actually happen.

685
00:54:39,986 --> 00:54:41,862
This is awesome.

686
00:55:09,557 --> 00:55:10,516
Oh, thanks.

687
00:55:13,811 --> 00:55:15,479
Sir.

688
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:19,942
Sit down, everyone.

689
00:55:25,740 --> 00:55:28,117
You already know who I am.

690
00:55:30,786 --> 00:55:32,913
You're probably curious about who this is.

691
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:38,085
He will be the CFO of this project
on my behalf

692
00:55:38,169 --> 00:55:42,631
since I stepped back.

693
00:55:43,382 --> 00:55:45,051
This is Cho Jeong-hyeon.

694
00:55:57,980 --> 00:55:59,148
I'm Cho Jeong-hyeon.

695
00:56:00,483 --> 00:56:01,984
Through this group,

696
00:56:02,068 --> 00:56:06,989
I will do my best to help more companies
in our country to sign contracts with ANK.

697
00:56:58,541 --> 00:57:01,168
-Do I know you?
-Why are you acting like this?

698
00:57:01,252 --> 00:57:02,211
Stay out of it.

699
00:57:02,294 --> 00:57:04,964
Just stay out if you can't handle it!

700
00:57:05,047 --> 00:57:06,799
The more I think of it, the cuter it is.

701
00:57:06,882 --> 00:57:09,385
What do you think?
I tried to bring back the mood.

702
00:57:09,468 --> 00:57:11,762
This is where you go down
on your knees and beg.

703
00:57:11,846 --> 00:57:13,264
I can do it.

704
00:57:13,347 --> 00:57:15,724
I can't believe something like this
is happening in my life.

705
00:57:15,808 --> 00:57:17,309
I prepared something special.

706
00:57:17,393 --> 00:57:18,310
Who are you people?

707
00:57:18,394 --> 00:57:19,728
-Remember?
-Yi-rang.

708
00:57:19,812 --> 00:57:21,397
Do you feel shitty?

709
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,399
He's dying because of you.

710
00:57:23,482 --> 00:57:24,483
