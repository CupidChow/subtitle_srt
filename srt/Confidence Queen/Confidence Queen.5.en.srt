EPISODE 5

2
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:45,087
We must hurry and cross
the Samdocheon River before sunrise.

3
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,089
What's that?

4
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:50,384
The river on the border
of the living world and the afterlife.

5
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:54,972
Then, does that mean I'm dead?

6
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,768
Hurry along.

7
00:00:58,851 --> 00:01:02,563
If we don't get there on time,
King Yeomra will be furious.

8
00:01:03,856 --> 00:01:04,857
Where are we going?

9
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:07,443
Heaven?

10
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,820
Or paradise?

11
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:17,369
Paradise?

12
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:21,540
There's only one place for those
who have lied and deceived others.

13
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,877
That is The Great Ocean Hell.

14
00:01:26,045 --> 00:01:27,296
The great lotion hell?

15
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:32,426
The place that cuts the bones
of sinners alive with a giant saw.

16
00:01:33,469 --> 00:01:34,887
With a saw?

17
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,764
My bones? Cut them? Why?

18
00:01:37,431 --> 00:01:39,558
No! Wait!

19
00:01:39,642 --> 00:01:41,393
I'm not a bad guy!

20
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:43,979
Hold on! I'm not a bad guy!

21
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:48,776
Mr. Jeon?

22
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:50,152
Chairman Jeon Tae-su?

23
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:51,278
How have you been?

24
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,783
Trust!

25
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:57,660
Bring my 50 billion back.

26
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,161
My 50 billion.

27
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:00,287
Fifty billion!

28
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:02,039
No!

29
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,083
Fifty billion…

30
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:09,421
I'm just checking
since you were asleep for so long.

31
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,216
It hurts.

32
00:02:12,758 --> 00:02:13,968
It couldn't be that bad.

33
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,304
You'll recover quickly
since it was a laparoscopic surgery.

34
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:19,098
The scar won't be too bad either,

35
00:02:19,181 --> 00:02:21,392
so try not to worry too much.

36
00:02:22,309 --> 00:02:23,310
King Yeomra…

37
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:26,313
No.

38
00:02:27,189 --> 00:02:28,023
Never mind.

39
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:31,569
You're only a kid.
How do you know so much?

40
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:33,904
If you're in the hospital
more than school,

41
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,614
you basically are a doctor.

42
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:38,784
Goodness, that's amazing.

43
00:02:39,451 --> 00:02:40,411
Gu-ho!

44
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:41,996
-Gu-ho?
-James.

45
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:42,997
Gu-ho.

46
00:02:44,331 --> 00:02:46,083
Gosh, what happened?

47
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,459
Did the surgery go well?

48
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:50,838
You've lost so much weight.

49
00:02:51,338 --> 00:02:52,423
Have you eaten anything?

50
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,425
His surgery went well.

51
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:55,968
He can't eat until he passes gas.

52
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,221
He should avoid
excessive exercise for a week or two.

53
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:02,516
No drinking or smoking,
and avoid overeating, fatigue,

54
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,727
and stress for a month or two.

55
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:07,187
Who is this cute little lady?

56
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,482
In my opinion, I'm not cute at all.

57
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:12,234
I'm also not little.

58
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:13,986
And I'm absolutely not a lady.

59
00:03:14,069 --> 00:03:16,322
I'm sorry, but you're so adorable.

60
00:03:16,405 --> 00:03:17,531
Who are you?

61
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:19,742
What about you?

62
00:03:21,869 --> 00:03:23,871
You're not pretty enough

63
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,873
to be his girlfriend.

64
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,042
What?

65
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:32,087
Well, we are
this handsome guy's co-workers.

66
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,256
I see. I'm Han Jae-hee.

67
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,466
Hi, I'm James.

68
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:44,475
Yun Yi-rang.

69
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:48,437
Were your nicknames
"Batyirang" or "Batgorang"?

70
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,565
I never had such nicknames.

71
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:53,067
Or maybe you didn't have friends.

72
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,945
Yes, I did! I had a lot.

73
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,905
Who cares if you had no friends?

74
00:03:57,988 --> 00:03:59,573
I don't have any either.

75
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:02,576
Really?

76
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,123
Hey, what are you doing?

77
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:09,708
It was a laparoscopic surgery.

78
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:11,085
The swelling's all gone already.

79
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,711
How do you know all that?

80
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:16,131
Since his guardians are here,
I'll be off now.

81
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:21,345
Gosh, she's unbelievable.

82
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,138
It's like there are two Yi-rangs.

83
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,767
I've never seen Yi-rang
lose like that before.

84
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,811
-I know, right?
-Unbelievable.

85
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,396
Who says I lost?

86
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,189
Have you ever seen me lose to anyone?

87
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,107
What?

88
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:36,235
She totally lost.

89
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,820
Hello, sir.

90
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,204
Is his name "Gosh?"

91
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,499
How come all doctors
are so good-looking these days?

92
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,252
-Are you eating well?
-Hey, looks aren't everything.

93
00:04:53,335 --> 00:04:55,254
-He's the director of Jaekyeong Hospital.
-What?

94
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,964
The genius surgeon, Jo Seong-woo.

95
00:04:57,464 --> 00:04:58,382
Really?

96
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,135
He's one of the five best in Korea
for major artery surgeries.

97
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:03,512
Damn, he has it all.

98
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:05,931
Hi, Jae-hee.

99
00:05:08,267 --> 00:05:10,686
-Yi-rang, why are you squirming?
-What's wrong with you?

100
00:05:10,769 --> 00:05:13,480
-Stop squirming.
-There she goes again.

101
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:14,857
-This is embarrassing.
-My gosh.

102
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,693
You must've been tired. You slept a lot.

103
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:19,653
I'm jealous.

104
00:05:19,737 --> 00:05:20,696
-Jeal--
-What?

105
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,031
You're jealous?

106
00:05:23,407 --> 00:05:25,409
You look like you're about to pass out.

107
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,994
Would you like to take a seat?

108
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:29,830
The surgery went well.

109
00:05:29,913 --> 00:05:32,458
You can't eat until you pass gas.

110
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,543
And you have to stay
for treatment until tomorrow.

111
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:37,379
-And what else?
-Drinking and smoking.

112
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:40,591
Right. Of course, no drinking and smoking.

113
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,967
Not until your wounds heal.

114
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,428
Bye, Doctor.

115
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,929
Goodness.

116
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,265
Let's see how you feel
and run a few more tests today.

117
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,726
I'll make sure they go easy on you.

118
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,063
Have you had any other problems?

119
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,776
Jae-hee, don't worry about anything,

120
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:00,527
and just trust me.

121
00:06:03,655 --> 00:06:04,615
And eat well, okay?

122
00:06:05,282 --> 00:06:06,325
Okay.

123
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,412
The director's in a different league.
He's so kind.

124
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:13,999
-He's so different from my doctor.
-I know.

125
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:25,135
Hey, kid.

126
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:26,887
Didn't that offend you just now?

127
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,138
It did.

128
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:30,432
Why did he touch my head
without my permission?

129
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:34,436
Exactly. When someone touches my head,
it feels like they're touching my brain.

130
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,521
It's so unpleasant.

131
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:38,690
Exactly.
Does he think I'm a baby or something?

132
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:42,277
I mean, even if I were a baby,
he still can't do that.

133
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:43,570
Of course, he can't do that.

134
00:06:43,654 --> 00:06:46,740
And just because he's a doctor,
it doesn't mean his hands are clean

135
00:06:46,824 --> 00:06:49,451
All those germs spreading on his hands…

136
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,995
NAME: HAN JAE-HEE
DIAGNOSIS: COARCTATION OF THE AORTA

137
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:53,288
Seriously, I…

138
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:13,934
Gosh, I'm thirsty.

139
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,920
COARCTATION OF THE AORTA

140
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:26,548
A CONDITION WHERE THE MAIN ARTERY
IS NARROWED…

141
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:32,638
"Congenital defect."

142
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:33,889
CAUSES

143
00:08:33,972 --> 00:08:36,308
If you're in the hospital
more than school,

144
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,976
you basically are a doctor.

145
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:43,523
Goodness.

146
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,442
She must be having such a hard time.

147
00:08:57,162 --> 00:08:57,996
Jae-hee.

148
00:09:00,123 --> 00:09:01,250
Ta-da.

149
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,293
It's for you.

150
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:08,882
I thought you liked stuffed animals.

151
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,301
Claw machines are what I like.

152
00:09:11,385 --> 00:09:13,303
You like claw machines?

153
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:16,807
Too bad then.
I guess I better take this with me.

154
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,849
Give it to me.

155
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:23,480
Since it's from you, I'll try to like it.

156
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:24,982
You will?

157
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,275
Yeah.

158
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,694
Good luck with your surgery.

159
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,613
When you come to remove your stitches,

160
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:33,657
you'll come see me, right?

161
00:09:38,453 --> 00:09:39,329
Should I?

162
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,623
How about we play claw machines that day?

163
00:09:41,707 --> 00:09:42,916
Sounds good.

164
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:44,626
But don't tell Mom.

165
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,712
I won't tell your mom.

166
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:48,797
Bye.

167
00:09:49,298 --> 00:09:50,799
Good luck with your surgery.

168
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:52,509
-Thanks.
-You got this.

169
00:09:59,808 --> 00:10:02,311
James, be careful. Easy.

170
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:08,191
Hey!

171
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,819
I didn't even touch you yet.

172
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:11,987
You didn't?

173
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:13,780
-Go easy.
-Move.

174
00:10:26,084 --> 00:10:27,794
What's with that suspicious look?

175
00:10:27,878 --> 00:10:28,795
Nothing.

176
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:33,425
You look like a professional.

177
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:34,551
You're basically a doctor.

178
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,928
Doctor, my foot.
Anyone can disinfect wounds.

179
00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:41,058
That hurts, Yi-rang!

180
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:44,811
Anyone can do it,
but I feel so assured with you doing it!

181
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:46,521
That's what I mean.

182
00:10:46,605 --> 00:10:49,107
No, she's not just anyone.

183
00:10:49,191 --> 00:10:51,610
She saw last time
where the surgery had been done

184
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:54,196
and immediately knew
it was a laparoscopic procedure.

185
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:56,656
She probably just read about it
from a few books.

186
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,158
No.

187
00:10:58,241 --> 00:11:01,078
I graduated
from a medical school in Texas.

188
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:04,873
-Medical school?
-Wait, how can you say that so casually?

189
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,417
But Yi-rang,
you majored in criminal psychology.

190
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,837
You don't think I have
only one degree, do you?

191
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:12,839
Did you forget that I'm Yun Yi-rang?

192
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:16,343
The more I get to know you,
the more you amaze me.

193
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:19,513
-When are your stitches being removed?
-Why do you ask?

194
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:22,307
It's about that little girl, Jae-hee,
isn't it?

195
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,935
You keep thinking about her, right?

196
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:25,977
I actually was too.

197
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:28,605
Yi-rang was just like her
when she was ten--

198
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,858
Tenacious, cute, and pretty.

199
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,986
She'd be happy
to see all three of us, right?

200
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:38,490
Well, I'm sure she'll act like she's not.

201
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:41,284
All done. Hey, lose some weight.

202
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:48,500
Jae-hee--

203
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,046
Hello.

204
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:04,474
There she is.

205
00:12:06,977 --> 00:12:08,145
Jae-hee!

206
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:13,942
It's not her.

207
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:20,323
Right, the stairs.

208
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:26,037
Goodness…

209
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:31,501
Why is he taking so long to bring the kid?

210
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,921
I know. Maybe she hasn't recovered yet?

211
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,553
Please help my daughter.

212
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,682
What on earth?
A one-person protest at a hospital?

213
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,144
Please look at this.

214
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,188
You're right.

215
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:56,026
Doctor! Please operate
on my daughter, Jae-hee.

216
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:57,819
Jae-hee?

217
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:00,572
HER LIFE IS BEING NEGLECTED!

218
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:01,948
Please help.

219
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:17,005
We really can't delay it anymore.

220
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,424
Hey! Watch your mouth, will you?

221
00:13:19,508 --> 00:13:20,717
What's this intense discussion?

222
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,553
If this medical malpractice gets out,
we'll both be ruined.

223
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:27,015
We can quickly do another surgery
before this gets any worse.

224
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,142
If we delay this anymore,
it'll be a disaster!

225
00:13:29,226 --> 00:13:31,686
The chairman already said no, you idiot.

226
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:34,814
So, are we supposed to let the kid die?

227
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,399
Then, things will get more out of hand.

228
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,901
Will you be able to handle that?

229
00:13:38,777 --> 00:13:41,821
For fuck's sake,
what do you expect me to do?

230
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:42,906
Just let me do it.

231
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:47,619
I'll meet with and convince the chairman.
Just set up an opportunity for us to talk.

232
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:50,372
If we waste any more time,
we're going to kill Jae-hee!

233
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:52,541
Keep your fucking voice down.

234
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,253
Seong-woo, we're doctors.

235
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:58,296
If something happens to her,

236
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,924
you think we'll be able
to continue with our careers?

237
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,884
Stop whining, you idiot.

238
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:05,053
You think we'll be
the only ones getting screwed?

239
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:06,805
Do you?

240
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,765
What if people find out
it was a ghost surgery?

241
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,268
Everyone will go down like dominoes.

242
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,436
Even the innocent employees.

243
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:15,730
Get it?

244
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,446
Get your act together, Gwang-sik.

245
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,582
Doctor.

246
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,586
What was all of that? Wait, stop.

247
00:14:37,669 --> 00:14:39,838
What happened to Jae-hee?

248
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,428
HER LIFE IS BEING NEGLECTED!
PLEASE DON'T GIVE UP ON HER!

249
00:14:47,012 --> 00:14:48,597
What on earth is going on?

250
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,348
We should've suspected it.

251
00:14:51,766 --> 00:14:53,810
What? Suspected what?

252
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,815
If her veins became narrow
due to the coarctation of the aorta,

253
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,192
and if she developed cyanosis,

254
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:03,111
she was likely in pain while walking.

255
00:15:03,194 --> 00:15:05,196
Have you had any other problems?

256
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:09,242
But if he hadn't known that
or taken it seriously,

257
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,244
we should've been suspicious.

258
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,830
We should've seen
if he was a real doctor

259
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:16,541
or just a damn fraud.

260
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:18,877
James, Yi-rang!

261
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:20,545
What happened?

262
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:23,381
There was an accident
during Jae-hee's surgery.

263
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:26,134
They won't perform another surgery on her.

264
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:28,887
Those bastards are trying to stop it
from leaking out.

265
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:29,888
What?

266
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,598
What do we do, Yi-rang?

267
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,106
It was…

268
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:42,651
It was all my fault.

269
00:15:42,734 --> 00:15:45,111
The week I had her surgery,

270
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:48,114
I was swamped with VIP surgeries

271
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:51,117
and night shifts back-to-back.

272
00:15:51,201 --> 00:15:55,288
Then, I was suddenly scheduled
for Han Jae-hee's surgery.

273
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:57,874
-The genius surgeon, Jo Seong-woo.
-Scalpel.

274
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:01,044
It was all a fabricated image.

275
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:05,423
Jo Seong-woo was a typical prep school kid
raised to become a doctor

276
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:08,635
under the strict control of his father,
who founded Jaekyeong Hospital.

277
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:12,430
His father was the director
and a top surgeon, and after he passed,

278
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:13,932
Jo inherited the hospital.

279
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,017
He was born
with a silver spoon in his mouth.

280
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,896
Gosh, my legs.

281
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,524
Im Gwang-sik performed
all the difficult surgeries instead,

282
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,484
and Jo Seong-woo took all the credit.

283
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:29,072
All these ghost surgeries
made Im Gwang-sik increasingly exhausted,

284
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,074
and on the day of Jae-hee's surgery…

285
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,633
Gauze. Check the vitals.

286
00:16:48,717 --> 00:16:49,843
They're still stable.

287
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:51,094
Let's get out of here.

288
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,178
What? What is it?

289
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,848
Hey, what happened?

290
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,560
Hey, tell me what happened!

291
00:17:02,147 --> 00:17:06,860
So, why did this man, Im Gwang-sik,
perform ghost surgeries for Jo Seong-woo

292
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,486
in the first place?

293
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:10,989
Im was the top student
in Hankuk University Medical School.

294
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:14,367
His family lost everything
after his father was scammed.

295
00:17:14,451 --> 00:17:17,579
But Jaekyeong Hospital paid off
all the debt and sponsored his tuition

296
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,706
and even his living expenses.

297
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:22,208
And they hired him
right after graduation.

298
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,626
Well, you get it, right?

299
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:26,588
Jo Seong-woo is an absolute menace.

300
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:29,883
He's holding someone down with money
and taking advantage of him.

301
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,926
Then, the target is clear this time.

302
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,387
Nope. The main villain is someone else.

303
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:37,015
The chairman of Jaekyeong Hospital,
Lee Seon-mi.

304
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:39,684
Will you please
let me meet Chairman Lee?

305
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,186
I'm begging you.

306
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,688
Not today.
She has business outside the office.

307
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:50,403
-Chairman Lee.
-What's going on?

308
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:53,072
This is for you.

309
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:54,949
Gosh, thank you.

310
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:56,493
Chairman Lee,

311
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,704
I was told Jae-hee's surgery
would be scheduled soon,

312
00:17:59,788 --> 00:18:01,456
but I was told to just keep waiting.

313
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,919
Well, Jae-hee isn't the only one
who needs urgent surgery.

314
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:09,380
We'll adjust our schedule
to the best of our ability.

315
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:12,258
If you wait at home,
we'll contact you soon.

316
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:16,346
Thank you for your help.

317
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:17,305
Sure.

318
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,390
-Thank you so much, ma'am.
-Of course.

319
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:24,145
Once Jo Seong-woo built
his false reputation,

320
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:26,397
Jaekyeong Hospital was always
packed with patients.

321
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:29,984
Gosh, I'm sick of this.

322
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:32,278
If a patient won't make them money,
no matter how urgent,

323
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,072
she'll endlessly delay surgery.

324
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:35,615
Goodness…

325
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:36,991
They're dried persimmons.

326
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,578
But patients with a lot of money,

327
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,623
regardless of how critical
their condition is or when they came in,

328
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,875
are given priority.

329
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:47,961
She is already well-known for that.

330
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,629
Hi, it's me.

331
00:18:50,255 --> 00:18:53,174
Move the lawyer Choi up to third in line.

332
00:18:54,008 --> 00:18:56,970
Mr. Kim, you moved
the lawyer Choi to third, right?

333
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,263
Right. Well, not yet.

334
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:59,556
Come on, move him up now.

335
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:00,974
Yes, ma'am.

336
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:01,933
HAN JAE-HEE
CHOI CHI-HUN

337
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:05,019
-Did you do it?
-Well, what about Han Jae-hee?

338
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,521
Just leave her.

339
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,648
Don't worry about her.

340
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:10,358
Geez. Did you move him up?

341
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:12,110
Yes.

342
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,444
HAN JAE-HEE

343
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,955
-Hey, she's not gone yet?
-Sorry?

344
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,207
Park Jae-hee or whatever.
She's not dead yet?

345
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,250
Mom…

346
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,587
That was too harsh.

347
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,172
Harsh?

348
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,759
Hey. She didn't die during surgery.
Isn't that enough?

349
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:40,638
We gave notice that complications
may occur during surgery.

350
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,432
Her mom signed the consent form.

351
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:45,476
And after she begged us,
we did the surgery for her.

352
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,811
So what's the issue?

353
00:19:47,729 --> 00:19:50,982
It's her mother's fault
for making the wrong choice.

354
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,233
Chairman Lee,

355
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,320
Jae-hee could die
if she doesn't get another surgery.

356
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,030
If you just give me an operating room,

357
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,240
I can solve the problem.
It's not that complicated.

358
00:19:59,324 --> 00:20:00,700
My goodness.

359
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,954
You idiots came to visit me
outside of your work hours

360
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:07,957
for some kid that doesn't make any money

361
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,377
to waste my precious time?

362
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:15,131
I'm talking about a matter
of life and death.

363
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:16,966
This worthless golf more important to you?

364
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,260
What did he just say?

365
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:21,512
I mean…

366
00:20:22,096 --> 00:20:23,598
-Look…
-Stay out of it.

367
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:26,476
Hey.

368
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,145
I fed you and gave you a home

369
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:32,774
when you were about to be
thrown out onto the streets

370
00:20:32,857 --> 00:20:36,569
because of your parents' debt.

371
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:40,531
I even spent the foundation's money
to pay for your damn tuition

372
00:20:40,615 --> 00:20:42,408
and turn you into a doctor.

373
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:43,743
But what?

374
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,036
Worthless golf?

375
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:46,412
Hey, you idiot.

376
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,247
You know what?

377
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:50,833
This worthless golf
is more important to me

378
00:20:50,917 --> 00:20:53,378
than some damn girl
who doesn't make me money.

379
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:54,671
So what?

380
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,673
What are you going to do about it,
you punk?

381
00:20:58,758 --> 00:20:59,759
Look.

382
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:03,179
If we got a good scene
for our hospital's promotional video,

383
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,973
she's run out of use, you idiot.

384
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:06,349
So,

385
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:13,398
stop wasting your time
on something so useless.

386
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:17,694
And focus on the VIP surgeries
that actually make money, you fucks!

387
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:18,903
Got it?

388
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:21,114
Answer me, you fuck! Did you get it?

389
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:23,074
Hey, get out. Now!

390
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,159
Let go! Let go, you idiot!

391
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:26,786
You little motherfucker.

392
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,496
Mom, are you crazy?

393
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:31,499
-What will you do if you hurt his arm?
-You punk.

394
00:21:31,582 --> 00:21:33,710
Let him hurt his arm!

395
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,796
Let him hurt it! Tell him to smash it!

396
00:21:36,879 --> 00:21:40,800
Smash it until it's ground to dust,
you motherfucker!

397
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,720
You think I can't find
another doctor like him?

398
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:47,140
Hey, I won't lose sleep over
losing a punk like that!

399
00:21:47,223 --> 00:21:49,684
Don't you know who I am? Don't you know?

400
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:51,060
Where are you going? Hey!

401
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:52,729
Hey, you motherfucker! Come back here!

402
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:53,855
Hey!

403
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:57,025
The real source of evil
was Chairman Lee Seon-mi.

404
00:21:57,108 --> 00:22:01,029
She's using her son, Jo Seong-woo,
to control everything.

405
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,656
How are we going to make them pay?

406
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,870
Okay. It's been decided.

407
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:12,540
The codename for this operation
will be "Eye and Tooth."

408
00:22:12,623 --> 00:22:14,709
Right. An eye for an eye,
a tooth for a tooth.

409
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:15,752
That's right.

410
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,545
I'm going to show them

411
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:20,465
that if they make others cry,
they'll cry tears of blood.

412
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:24,343
We'll do the same to them
as what they did to Jae-hee.

413
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:27,597
If I, Yun Yi-rang, eat a grudge…

414
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:28,639
Eat what?

415
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:29,974
You mean "develops a grudge."

416
00:22:30,058 --> 00:22:31,726
-Yeah.
-Right.

417
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,144
If I develop a grudge,

418
00:22:33,227 --> 00:22:37,899
I'll make sure she experiences fire
and brimstone even in the dead of winter.

419
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:41,319
THE OPERATION BEGINS

420
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,293
I'll take that.

421
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,711
My apologies, ma'am.

422
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:00,922
But this has already been reserved.

423
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:02,590
So what?

424
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:05,843
I'm sorry to say,
but this item cannot be purchased.

425
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,931
Just do as I say
instead of talking back, damn it.

426
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:16,896
You know what this is, right?

427
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,982
We're well aware
you're a Black Sapphire member.

428
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,818
We've always been grateful for that.

429
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,862
Is this how you show your gratitude?

430
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:28,658
I come here every time
you release a new model…

431
00:23:31,786 --> 00:23:32,662
Who are you?

432
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:35,123
What are you doing?

433
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:37,500
I'll take it now.

434
00:23:38,042 --> 00:23:39,085
Thank you.

435
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,717
Customers like that must be troublesome.

436
00:23:46,801 --> 00:23:48,636
It's okay.

437
00:23:49,178 --> 00:23:52,348
They absolutely loved
the gift you suggested last time.

438
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,976
-I'm glad to hear that.
-So damn pretentious.

439
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,644
-Thank you. Goodbye.
-Bye.

440
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:04,235
Who was that?

441
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,070
She's a Crown member.

442
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:08,698
That's an annual spending
of over one billion won.

443
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:09,782
I know that, damn it!

444
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,910
-Right.
-What kind of young girl

445
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:14,537
can go around splurging like that?

446
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,832
Whatever. Go.

447
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,461
Geez, it's been a while
since I've felt this insecure.

448
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,756
What took you so long to pick up?

449
00:24:26,465 --> 00:24:28,509
Get the car ready! Now!

450
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:32,221
Hello.

451
00:24:32,305 --> 00:24:34,974
Gu-ho, make Lee Seon-mi
smell a perfume sample.

452
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:38,186
We'll use Lee Seon-mi's allergies
to induce coughing.

453
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:40,188
She's sensitive to scents.

454
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:50,823
What?

455
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,783
You have a strange standing posture.

456
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:54,493
Your upper body is crooked.

457
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:56,746
What on earth?

458
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:01,417
Hey. How dare you touch me?

459
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:04,420
I knew it.

460
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,923
You must've had pain in your shoulder.

461
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:10,092
Your complexion's not looking good,
and you have swelling too.

462
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:14,222
Well, everyone in Korea has tech neck.

463
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:16,057
You probably have a dry cough too.

464
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:20,686
Oh my.

465
00:25:21,771 --> 00:25:23,022
Go see a doctor now.

466
00:25:25,107 --> 00:25:28,236
What? Are you a doctor or something?

467
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:30,488
Consult a thoracic surgeon.

468
00:25:32,406 --> 00:25:33,407
A thoracic surgeon?

469
00:25:33,491 --> 00:25:34,909
Wait!

470
00:25:34,992 --> 00:25:38,287
For Christ's sake! What kind of obnoxious…

471
00:25:38,371 --> 00:25:39,247
My goodness.

472
00:25:41,958 --> 00:25:43,834
MY SON THE SUPER DOCTOR

473
00:25:44,418 --> 00:25:45,503
What?

474
00:25:45,586 --> 00:25:48,256
If this is about that girl,
don't even think about it!

475
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:49,924
No, it's not that.

476
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:52,426
Gwang-sik didn't show up.

477
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,512
But he has surgeries to do today.

478
00:25:54,595 --> 00:25:56,097
They aren't difficult ones,

479
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:59,308
so I found a way
for other doctors to do them, but…

480
00:26:00,309 --> 00:26:01,811
What if he's not here tomorrow either?

481
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:03,312
What if he never comes back?

482
00:26:03,396 --> 00:26:05,022
Check his house first.

483
00:26:05,106 --> 00:26:07,733
If he's not there,
call his family in his hometown.

484
00:26:07,817 --> 00:26:08,776
Mom, how could you swing…

485
00:26:09,443 --> 00:26:11,404
a golf club at someone
who relies on his hands?

486
00:26:11,487 --> 00:26:13,114
Are you blaming me?

487
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:15,157
Geez, I can't believe this.

488
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:19,537
Everyone else's sons would leap
at the chance to defend their moms.

489
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:22,248
But how can you still…

490
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:24,041
Hey.

491
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:26,127
Do you think I'm pathetic?

492
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:30,631
My goodness! People were right to say
you're better off not having kids!

493
00:26:30,715 --> 00:26:33,884
Gosh, my life was all in vain!

494
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:35,803
Okay. I'm sorry.

495
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,139
Don't be mad, Mom.

496
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:39,056
Whatever.

497
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,685
You know I hate hassles.

498
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:45,146
Yes. I know that very well.

499
00:26:45,229 --> 00:26:46,480
Do whatever it takes

500
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,899
and bring him to me.

501
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:49,817
Okay?

502
00:26:50,526 --> 00:26:51,360
Okay?

503
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:52,820
Answer me.

504
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:54,405
Okay.

505
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:56,490
I got it.

506
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,745
GWANG-SIK

507
00:27:02,163 --> 00:27:04,248
The person you are calling
is not available.

508
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:09,337
Gwang-sik, you idiot. Damn it.

509
00:27:35,237 --> 00:27:36,405
I'll make them pay

510
00:27:37,823 --> 00:27:39,533
for what they did…

511
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,078
to you.

512
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:57,885
Jae-hee, you can get surgery now.

513
00:27:57,968 --> 00:27:59,845
Hang in there, Jae-hee.

514
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:17,446
Just a minute!

515
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:26,372
Seon-mi.

516
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:29,333
The glow of your skin is incredible.

517
00:28:29,417 --> 00:28:32,420
If you have something good,
share it with us.

518
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:33,838
I don't have anything.

519
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:36,841
I'm too busy to focus on any of that.

520
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,926
-Look at her act so coy.
-Come on.

521
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:44,723
That coat!

522
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:49,019
Isn't that from Brada's latest collection?

523
00:28:49,103 --> 00:28:51,856
You're right.
And he's wearing Hermesha shoes.

524
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,025
That's so stylish.

525
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,945
He's totally my type!

526
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:03,033
But she's not interested
in guys like that.

527
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:06,036
-You're sensitive to this, right?
-Right.

528
00:29:07,997 --> 00:29:10,791
That reminds me of her first love.

529
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:15,504
You mean that art major guy
who smelled nice?

530
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:18,257
-Yeah.
-Wasn't the cologne you liked then

531
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:20,801
called Atmos Black Noir?

532
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:25,848
Girl, you have a good memory.

533
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:32,104
Lee Seon-mi is very sensitive to smells.

534
00:29:32,188 --> 00:29:35,816
And if it's the cologne
that brings back tender memories

535
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,610
of her first love?

536
00:29:39,945 --> 00:29:42,781
I produced a cologne
that would lure her in.

537
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:47,119
Nothing works better
to make a powerful impression.

538
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:10,559
Hello?

539
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:13,687
Yes.

540
00:30:17,066 --> 00:30:19,109
This punk…

541
00:30:19,193 --> 00:30:20,778
PERSONNEL CARD

542
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:35,626
I'll call you as soon as I find him.

543
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,217
The usual.

544
00:30:44,051 --> 00:30:45,427
Yes, ma'am.

545
00:31:03,028 --> 00:31:03,946
MAINTENANCE

546
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:07,658
There is a big decrease
in VIP reservations.

547
00:31:07,741 --> 00:31:10,744
It seems word has spread
that surgeries are being delayed.

548
00:31:10,828 --> 00:31:13,497
There were quite
a lot of cancellations as well.

549
00:31:13,581 --> 00:31:16,584
They say if Director Jo
can't perform their surgeries,

550
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,752
they'll go to other hospitals.

551
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:21,297
Geez, Im Gwang-sik, that punk…

552
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,221
Im Gwang-sik is the problem,
that damn punk!

553
00:31:29,305 --> 00:31:31,515
He should've done the surgeries
as I told him to.

554
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:34,685
How dare that brat from the gutter
act so aloof.

555
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:38,480
Hey, have you done what I mentioned?

556
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:41,442
I haven't heard from them yet.

557
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:47,906
First, I need to find a replacement.

558
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:50,993
CHAIRMAN LEE SEON-MI

559
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:54,246
Hey, schedule a meet-up
with Professor Lee and Professor Kim.

560
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:56,915
Gosh.

561
00:31:59,001 --> 00:32:00,127
Geez.

562
00:32:03,505 --> 00:32:05,507
-Nice shot.
-Nice shot!

563
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:06,759
Professor Kim.

564
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:10,012
I'm doing well today.

565
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:11,305
Oh, right.

566
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:12,723
About what you mentioned…

567
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,309
Yes.

568
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:18,479
Well, do you know anyone good?

569
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:21,607
I mean, I'm swamped with patients,

570
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:25,527
but it's just impossible to find
a skilled doctor right now.

571
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,488
I'm sure it is.

572
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:30,115
Our field is having a huge labor shortage.

573
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,242
Wait, there's Jae-hyeok.

574
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:35,037
He opened his own clinic last year,

575
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,998
but I heard he's going to close it.

576
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:40,376
No way. Says who?

577
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,044
Choi's clinic hit it big.

578
00:32:42,127 --> 00:32:44,171
-Really?
-Professor Kim.

579
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:46,924
Jae-hyeok!

580
00:32:47,007 --> 00:32:48,801
We were actually talking about you.

581
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:51,637
I heard your clinic
has been thriving lately.

582
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,138
No, it's not thriving.

583
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:55,933
Tell me when you have time,
and I'll treat you for the whole day.

584
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:00,938
Coordinator Ma.

585
00:33:01,939 --> 00:33:02,773
Hi, Jae-hyeok.

586
00:33:03,816 --> 00:33:04,650
Oh my.

587
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:05,943
That man.

588
00:33:06,026 --> 00:33:07,027
He's that guy from…

589
00:33:13,534 --> 00:33:14,576
Okay, let's go.

590
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,179
Then…

591
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,516
Coordinator Ma, about the man
you mentioned last time…

592
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,517
Who?

593
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,937
The chairman from China you mentioned.

594
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,272
You mean Chairman Wang?

595
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:46,191
Do you think you could
bring him to my clinic?

596
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,573
I don't know.
That's not something I can decide.

597
00:33:53,073 --> 00:33:56,243
You need to meet the conditions he wants,
like the size of the hospital,

598
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,787
the doctors' qualifications, and all that.

599
00:33:58,871 --> 00:34:00,080
Of course.

600
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:03,000
I was asking you,
because I know what you're like.

601
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,210
Put in a good word for me.

602
00:34:05,294 --> 00:34:06,545
My goodness.

603
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:09,298
Anyway, I'll keep in touch.

604
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,215
Sure.

605
00:34:10,299 --> 00:34:12,843
I did hear about this coordinator

606
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:15,554
who introduces the top 0.1%
of VVIP patients to hospitals.

607
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:17,639
Was that him?

608
00:34:25,814 --> 00:34:27,316
-Hey! Drive faster!
-Yes, ma'am.

609
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,734
You're dead if you lose him.

610
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,694
-Step on the gas, you idiot!
-Yes, ma'am.

611
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,929
How can I help the Chairman
of Jaekyeong Hospital?

612
00:34:58,263 --> 00:34:59,515
Well…

613
00:35:00,641 --> 00:35:03,685
About the chairman from China…

614
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,521
How did you know that?

615
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:08,941
I'd like to invite him
to Jaekyeong Hospital.

616
00:35:12,027 --> 00:35:15,531
By the way, the cologne you're wearing…

617
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:26,583
There aren't many people who use that.

618
00:35:27,167 --> 00:35:30,045
-I'm sorry. I know we've just met.
-I have some…

619
00:35:31,505 --> 00:35:33,215
sad memories tied to that cologne.

620
00:35:37,052 --> 00:35:38,053
I love it.

621
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:45,811
I had malatang for lunch.

622
00:35:45,894 --> 00:35:50,190
After the meeting, I was thinking about
having pork belly and soju.

623
00:35:50,274 --> 00:35:51,859
Are you all up for it?

624
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:53,819
-Hello.
-Hello.

625
00:35:53,902 --> 00:35:54,903
Hi.

626
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:56,697
This is Director Jo Seong-woo.

627
00:35:57,656 --> 00:35:58,490
He's the director.

628
00:35:58,574 --> 00:35:59,950
The director. I see.

629
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,245
This way, please.

630
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:10,752
-Is the man in red Chairman Wang?
-Yes.

631
00:36:11,545 --> 00:36:14,965
He basically built all the elevators
in Guangzhou.

632
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,216
-Elevators?
-Yes.

633
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:20,262
I had hot and sour soup for lunch.

634
00:36:20,345 --> 00:36:22,764
After the operation,
I want pork belly.

635
00:36:22,848 --> 00:36:25,267
And soju. Everyone in?

636
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,184
Sounds good.

637
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,354
There must be an issue with his business.

638
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:30,647
Do you understand them?

639
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:33,358
Given the vibe and talk
about hot and sour soup, it's obvious.

640
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:34,610
I see.

641
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:41,450
It's the best-quality Tieguanyin tea.

642
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:43,994
Tea!

643
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,662
Gosh, thank you.

644
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:54,254
Oh my!

645
00:36:57,049 --> 00:36:58,091
My goodness.

646
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:00,260
Is that…

647
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,349
Tell him we'll pay extra attention
to take care of him.

648
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,227
-Sorry?
-She says, "We'll pay extra attention."

649
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:10,479
Really?

650
00:37:12,648 --> 00:37:14,399
Very good!

651
00:37:19,655 --> 00:37:22,824
We're getting so many patients
ever since Chairman Wang's visit.

652
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,618
I'm glad to hear that.

653
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:27,245
Oh my. There's more.

654
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,208
I think they're from the US.

655
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,251
Wait, there are people from Japan too.

656
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:35,087
This is great. Congratulations.

657
00:37:45,138 --> 00:37:46,723
Do you have anything special?

658
00:37:46,807 --> 00:37:48,266
Yes, coming right up.

659
00:37:53,063 --> 00:37:56,441
-Please keep it coming.
-Yes, I'll prepare it right away.

660
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:59,027
Oh no.

661
00:37:59,111 --> 00:38:01,238
I forgot which one.

662
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:02,906
Damn it. Whatever.

663
00:38:09,705 --> 00:38:10,789
Here you are.

664
00:38:14,084 --> 00:38:14,918
How about a love shot?

665
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:29,391
This is all thanks to you, Coordinator Ma.

666
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:31,476
Gosh, don't mention it.

667
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,771
Jaekyeong Hospital met all the conditions
Chairman Wang asked for.

668
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:36,398
I'm the one who owes you.

669
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:40,027
Goodness, you're so well-spoken too.

670
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:42,946
SAMJIN COORDINATOR CHOI

671
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:45,574
-Let me answer this.
-Sure.

672
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:49,411
Hello? How did it go?

673
00:38:51,121 --> 00:38:52,414
I see.

674
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:54,124
Well, okay. Bye.

675
00:38:56,626 --> 00:38:57,878
What? Is something wrong?

676
00:38:58,962 --> 00:39:01,631
Well, let me make one call.

677
00:39:01,715 --> 00:39:02,549
Sure.

678
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:06,636
Yes, Chairman Ju.

679
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:09,264
Chairman Ju… Chairman Ju?

680
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:11,558
Of Hanko Bio?

681
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:12,976
Yes. One second.

682
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,645
Yes, it's been confirmed
that Rachel's in Korea.

683
00:39:16,313 --> 00:39:20,442
I heard she pulled off Samjin's chairman's
aortic arch replacement surgery as well.

684
00:39:20,525 --> 00:39:23,570
His aortic dissection was pretty bad,
but I knew she'd do it.

685
00:39:23,653 --> 00:39:26,448
I did hear Samjin's CEO
was in critical condition.

686
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:27,491
-That means…
-Yes.

687
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:29,826
I'm trying to track her down
to the best of my ability.

688
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:31,411
Please give me some more time.

689
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:32,871
Okay, bye.

690
00:39:37,626 --> 00:39:42,005
Well, why bother looking for
Rachel or whoever?

691
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:44,674
Just introduce them to us.

692
00:39:46,593 --> 00:39:48,512
He's insistent on only seeing Rachel.

693
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:53,642
Is this Rachel that great?

694
00:40:02,234 --> 00:40:03,068
Are you all right?

695
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:07,114
I've been under a lot of stress lately.

696
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:08,073
I'm okay.

697
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:09,991
You should relieve that stress.

698
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,204
Let's forget everything tonight
and have fun.

699
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,180
Are you sure this is the house special?

700
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,267
Yes, today's house special.

701
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:52,450
-What was that?
-What was that sound?

702
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:53,785
What was that? Did she fart?

703
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:56,329
-Was that a fart?
-What was that?

704
00:40:57,122 --> 00:40:58,415
That was me. I did it.

705
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,960
She'd never do that.

706
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:08,508
That was me! Poot!

707
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:15,056
What on earth?

708
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:17,392
No one believes me?

709
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,478
How repulsive.

710
00:41:21,229 --> 00:41:22,898
Seon-mi, let's go.

711
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,817
Such a society of distrust!

712
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,279
Can't we just trust one another?

713
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:45,337
I want to make this man mine.

714
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:05,023
Seon-mi.

715
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:06,900
-Yes?
-Are you okay?

716
00:42:06,983 --> 00:42:09,986
-Yes, I am.
-Okay, straighten your arms and…

717
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,321
-Right.
-Relax your shoulders.

718
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:13,782
-Straighten your shoulders.
-Okay.

719
00:42:13,865 --> 00:42:16,660
-Where? Is it your shoulders?
-No, my shoulder blade is…

720
00:42:16,743 --> 00:42:19,120
-Can we take a short break?
-Sure.

721
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:20,956
-This way.
-I'm so sorry.

722
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:23,750
Normally, I'm never like this.

723
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:25,835
-What's wrong with me today?
-No worries.

724
00:42:26,962 --> 00:42:27,796
It happens.

725
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:46,648
And the highlight.

726
00:42:52,112 --> 00:42:54,447
Poot, poot, poot

727
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,963
Seon-mi.

728
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:11,589
-Where does it hurt?
-My chest!

729
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:14,301
Your chest?
I can't really help you with your chest.

730
00:43:14,384 --> 00:43:15,427
-My chest!
-My goodness.

731
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:17,679
-Let's go.
-Hurry! Please!

732
00:43:25,312 --> 00:43:27,397
-Get out of the way!
-Mom.

733
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,649
-Mom!
-Seong-woo!

734
00:43:29,733 --> 00:43:32,027
-Mom, what's wrong?
-I think I'm going to die!

735
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33,361
Are you okay?

736
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:35,822
My stomach. It hurts here!

737
00:43:35,905 --> 00:43:37,866
Mom, what happened? What's going on?

738
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:39,284
-Seong-woo!
-Mom!

739
00:43:39,993 --> 00:43:41,453
I'm dying.

740
00:43:41,536 --> 00:43:43,872
-Help!
-Seon-mi!

741
00:43:52,464 --> 00:43:55,967
WASH & HAPPY

742
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:03,224
Let's get started.

743
00:44:05,352 --> 00:44:07,437
LEE SEON-MI
JAEKYEONG HOSPITAL, CHAIRMAN

744
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,356
SENSITIVE TO SMELLS
DEPARTMENT STORE VIP

745
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:19,199
Okay. I got through the firewall.

746
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:25,663
Spot the DICOM stream…

747
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:26,748
ENTERING PACS SERVER

748
00:44:29,084 --> 00:44:31,920
Now, if I just switch the video…

749
00:44:42,472 --> 00:44:45,767
Three, two, one.

750
00:44:57,862 --> 00:44:58,696
But…

751
00:44:58,780 --> 00:45:00,156
How…

752
00:45:01,658 --> 00:45:04,035
Hey, what is it?

753
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:06,037
It's an aortic aneurysm.

754
00:45:06,121 --> 00:45:07,080
What?

755
00:45:07,664 --> 00:45:08,540
What's that?

756
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:11,042
It looks like it's been developing
for a while.

757
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:13,503
Have you had any discomfort
in your shoulder blades,

758
00:45:13,586 --> 00:45:16,423
chest pains, or a dry cough
from the pressure on the blood vessel?

759
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:19,884
My shoulder blade is…

760
00:45:19,968 --> 00:45:21,428
-My chest!
-Your chest?

761
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:23,346
Your… Goodness, Seon-mi!

762
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:28,268
Then, what she said was…

763
00:45:28,351 --> 00:45:31,229
You must've had pain in your shoulder.
You have swelling too.

764
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:33,273
You probably have a dry cough too.

765
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:36,067
No, that's impossible.

766
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:39,320
What do you mean it's impossible?
The result says so!

767
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:41,990
-How…
-You need to get surgery right away.

768
00:45:43,366 --> 00:45:45,702
-Right now?
-Of course! You have to do it now.

769
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:49,539
Mom, this is like living
with a time bomb in your chest.

770
00:45:49,622 --> 00:45:50,707
You'll never know

771
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:53,710
when you'll go into shock
or have a heart attack.

772
00:45:55,086 --> 00:45:56,588
Really?

773
00:45:57,464 --> 00:45:59,299
Then, I'd better get surgery right away.

774
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,972
Well, Dr. Jo is too busy, so…

775
00:46:06,055 --> 00:46:07,474
Which one of you two will do it?

776
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:12,312
Are you both out of your minds?

777
00:46:12,395 --> 00:46:13,438
The thing is,

778
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:16,608
this blood vessel is close
to the coronary ostium.

779
00:46:16,691 --> 00:46:17,734
The surgical area is narrow.

780
00:46:17,817 --> 00:46:21,738
It's a complex surgery where any damage
could lead to serious side effects.

781
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:25,575
-If Dr. Im Gwang-sik were here--
-That punk's not even here!

782
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:28,119
I mean…

783
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:29,996
Is that so?

784
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,415
Then, Dr. Jo,

785
00:46:32,499 --> 00:46:34,667
you should make yourself available.

786
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:44,093
Lee Seon-mi totally took the bait.

787
00:46:47,055 --> 00:46:48,515
-Yes!
-Yes!

788
00:46:48,598 --> 00:46:52,185
Yi-rang, this operation is great!
This one's the best yet.

789
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:55,980
I've always been good,
but this time, you did a good job.

790
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:58,066
What's with the sudden compliment?

791
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:01,653
Are you hiding something from me again?

792
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:04,906
I'm getting more anxious.

793
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:07,158
The key to this operation

794
00:47:07,242 --> 00:47:12,038
was to find out how to draw out
the symptoms naturally.

795
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:14,666
Only then, when I mention
the name of the illness,

796
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:17,418
she'll believe it and go,
"Right! That's what I have!"

797
00:47:17,502 --> 00:47:19,671
But for her shoulder pain,

798
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:22,590
I didn't have to do anything about it
since she loves golf.

799
00:47:22,674 --> 00:47:24,425
And this ephedra here.

800
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:26,803
It's good for your respiratory system.

801
00:47:26,886 --> 00:47:29,305
But if you take too much,
it induces dry coughs.

802
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:30,473
Exactly.

803
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:38,147
Mom, don't worry too much.

804
00:47:38,231 --> 00:47:41,192
I'll call around and look
for a doctor at a different hospital.

805
00:47:41,276 --> 00:47:43,653
No! Geez, you crazy…

806
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:46,698
Hey, are you insane?

807
00:47:47,323 --> 00:47:50,410
Looking for another doctor
when I have you is ridiculous.

808
00:47:50,493 --> 00:47:51,953
That's not what matters!

809
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:54,414
What matters is keeping you alive!

810
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:57,041
You little… No.

811
00:47:58,084 --> 00:48:01,170
"The mother of top surgeon Jo Seong-woo."

812
00:48:01,254 --> 00:48:04,382
"The chairman
of the great Jaekyeong Hospital."

813
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:06,009
Without these titles…

814
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:12,849
then there's no point in living.

815
00:48:12,932 --> 00:48:13,933
Got it, you punk?

816
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:16,853
-Damn it.
-For Christ's sake!

817
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:20,231
What the…

818
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:23,109
FOUND HIM
AT YONGJU-SI HANWOL RESERVOIR FISHING HOLE

819
00:48:23,192 --> 00:48:25,028
They found the bastard!

820
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:29,907
-What's with you, you punk?
-Mom, don't worry too much.

821
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:32,452
I'll talk some sense into Gwang-sik
and bring him back.

822
00:48:32,994 --> 00:48:34,078
Just leave it to me.

823
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,418
Damn it, Gwang-sik…

824
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:52,013
Im Gwang-sik.

825
00:48:58,061 --> 00:48:58,895
My mom

826
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:01,147
has an aortic aneurysm.

827
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:03,775
So what?

828
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:04,734
Hey.

829
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:07,987
You know you're the only doctor
who has the skills.

830
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:10,490
So, what if I perform her surgery?

831
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:13,409
Planning to go on TV
as a great doctor who saved his mother?

832
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:14,744
Hey.

833
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:17,163
That's not it, man.

834
00:49:17,246 --> 00:49:18,373
I can't do it.

835
00:49:19,916 --> 00:49:20,833
No, I won't do it.

836
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:22,085
Come on, Gwang-sik.

837
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:26,506
So, are you going to let her die?
She's my mom.

838
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:30,259
What if I make a mistake with the scissors
and her blood vessel ruptures?

839
00:49:31,344 --> 00:49:33,304
What if something goes wrong again?

840
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:34,889
Hey, come on.

841
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:37,266
That wasn't your fault. That was…

842
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:39,102
Fine. I'll admit it.

843
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:42,563
You were short on sleep because of all
the surgeries you had to do for me--

844
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:44,857
Do you really think I'm not at fault?

845
00:49:44,941 --> 00:49:46,567
Wait, Gwang-sik.

846
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:47,902
Damn it, come on!

847
00:49:50,822 --> 00:49:51,656
Hey.

848
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:54,575
Please save my mom.

849
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:58,079
If you do her surgery,
I'll do anything you want.

850
00:49:58,663 --> 00:49:59,497
Please?

851
00:50:01,082 --> 00:50:02,333
Look, Seong-woo.

852
00:50:09,924 --> 00:50:10,758
Hey…

853
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:14,053
What happened?

854
00:50:14,137 --> 00:50:15,847
My life as a doctor is over.

855
00:50:16,556 --> 00:50:18,307
I ended it with my own hands.

856
00:50:47,962 --> 00:50:48,880
Oh no!

857
00:50:50,423 --> 00:50:53,301
Am I really going to die like this?

858
00:51:00,641 --> 00:51:01,476
My phone.

859
00:51:02,310 --> 00:51:03,227
Where is my phone?

860
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:15,907
So,

861
00:51:17,033 --> 00:51:20,495
about the person
Chairman Ju is looking for…

862
00:51:21,204 --> 00:51:22,455
You mean Rachel?

863
00:51:23,247 --> 00:51:24,957
Right. Was her name Rachel?

864
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:29,504
What's so special about her
to cause everyone to make such a fuss?

865
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:34,217
She's basically a concierge doctor.

866
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:39,013
She's not tied to one hospital.
She moves freely based on client requests.

867
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:43,226
And her clients are influential big shots
in politics and finance around the world.

868
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:47,230
Rachel is the most skilled ghost doctor.

869
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:49,816
Anyway, why do you ask about her?

870
00:51:52,527 --> 00:51:53,694
Do you think

871
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:58,449
she could perform surgery on me too?

872
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:00,409
What?

873
00:52:01,494 --> 00:52:05,581
But your son is the highest authority
in major artery surgeries.

874
00:52:08,084 --> 00:52:09,126
The thing is…

875
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,045
I see. Of course.

876
00:52:13,631 --> 00:52:15,508
No matter how talented he may be,

877
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:18,344
it's not easy to perform surgery
on one's own mother.

878
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:20,721
I should've known better.

879
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:24,725
That's such a great excuse.
Why didn't I think of that?

880
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:31,691
Gosh, yes.
Of course, my son is outstanding.

881
00:52:32,233 --> 00:52:33,651
But if anything goes wrong,

882
00:52:34,527 --> 00:52:38,906
I'm scared it would scar my son
for the rest of his life.

883
00:52:39,699 --> 00:52:40,992
That's why.

884
00:52:41,075 --> 00:52:45,037
So can't I have Rachel do my surgery?

885
00:52:46,247 --> 00:52:49,333
-To tell you the truth--
-Yeah! Just tell me the truth.

886
00:52:50,459 --> 00:52:52,044
The cost is beyond what you can imagine.

887
00:52:53,504 --> 00:52:56,883
Geez, I suddenly feel offended now.

888
00:52:56,966 --> 00:53:00,219
Did you think I was that cheap?

889
00:53:00,303 --> 00:53:03,431
Do you think I wouldn't be able to pay
that much for my life?

890
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:06,225
That's not it. It really is unimaginable.

891
00:53:06,309 --> 00:53:07,852
I'm saying it doesn't matter how much!

892
00:53:07,935 --> 00:53:10,313
If I have to sell my house or land,
I'll get the money!

893
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:12,481
-Don't worry about that--
-No, it's not even that.

894
00:53:12,565 --> 00:53:14,984
It's really beyond--

895
00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:16,152
-Excuse me.
-But--

896
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:20,197
Hello?

897
00:53:21,282 --> 00:53:22,408
Yes.

898
00:53:26,954 --> 00:53:28,372
How much could it even be?

899
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:35,171
Damn it, I'll find her number on my own.

900
00:53:35,963 --> 00:53:36,797
I'll find…

901
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:44,639
Go see a doctor now.

902
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:46,432
Consult a thoracic surgeon.

903
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:47,516
What?

904
00:53:48,351 --> 00:53:49,477
Is this Rachel?

905
00:53:50,811 --> 00:53:52,104
Okay. Bye.

906
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,783
It's her.

907
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:05,576
Seon-mi, what are you doing?

908
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:07,954
Coordinator Ma, I know this woman!

909
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:11,332
I know it's not much, but…

910
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:21,550
This is the number I use to call her
when the item she wants comes in.

911
00:54:23,219 --> 00:54:25,805
But please don't tell her
that I gave it to you.

912
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:27,139
Of course, I won't.

913
00:54:30,601 --> 00:54:31,435
-Let's go.
-Wait.

914
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:32,353
What?

915
00:54:32,436 --> 00:54:33,729
Are you well enough to go?

916
00:54:33,813 --> 00:54:36,065
I've received a death sentence.
Nothing can stop me.

917
00:54:36,148 --> 00:54:39,193
-Who says you're going to die?
-Oh, you! Let's go now.

918
00:54:42,905 --> 00:54:43,739
Be careful.

919
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:46,575
Oh no! Are you okay?

920
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:48,160
-Yes, I'm fine.
-Okay.

921
00:54:48,828 --> 00:54:50,162
-Hurry up.
-Okay.

922
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:51,622
Be careful.

923
00:54:52,248 --> 00:54:53,082
Goodness.

924
00:54:53,874 --> 00:54:57,420
I'm sorry for the trouble of taking
the long way because of me.

925
00:54:57,503 --> 00:54:58,921
Don't worry. Watch out.

926
00:54:59,005 --> 00:55:00,464
-I said I'm fine.
-Okay.

927
00:55:01,924 --> 00:55:03,426
Is it this way or that way?

928
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:04,719
-Yes, it's this way.
-Which way?

929
00:55:04,802 --> 00:55:05,845
This way.

930
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:06,971
-By the way…
-Yes?

931
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:09,056
Didn't you say we were almost there?

932
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:10,683
-We really are almost there.
-Okay.

933
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:14,061
-Gosh, the crows…
-I don't even go on amusement park rides.

934
00:55:14,145 --> 00:55:16,105
-Really?
-Yes, I'm scared of heights.

935
00:55:16,188 --> 00:55:17,481
I see.

936
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:22,445
-Are you okay?
-Why is it shaking so much?

937
00:55:22,528 --> 00:55:24,697
-It's not too bad, right?
-But I'm walking carefully.

938
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:28,117
I'm walking so carefully,
but why is it shaking?

939
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,076
Are you okay?

940
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:37,793
Towards your legs.

941
00:55:37,877 --> 00:55:39,545
There she is. That's Rachel.

942
00:55:43,883 --> 00:55:45,342
The one in the very front?

943
00:55:45,426 --> 00:55:47,511
-Yes, that's right.
-I see.

944
00:55:55,019 --> 00:55:56,270
After surgery,

945
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:59,440
she always comes to the mountains
to train with her team.

946
00:55:59,523 --> 00:56:00,733
That's her routine.

947
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:06,155
My goodness.

948
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:24,673
It's too late now.

949
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:26,467
Late?

950
00:56:27,134 --> 00:56:28,260
What do you mean?

951
00:56:28,344 --> 00:56:29,345
What do you mean late?

952
00:56:30,012 --> 00:56:32,306
Are you saying she has no chance
even with surgery?

953
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:35,684
It's because…

954
00:56:37,978 --> 00:56:40,606
Chairman Ju already came by.

955
00:56:40,689 --> 00:56:42,024
What?

956
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,654
She means she's already booked.

957
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,364
It doesn't mean you have no chance.

958
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:49,448
What a relief.

959
00:56:50,449 --> 00:56:53,285
-And here, I thought… My goodness.
-This is great.

960
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:56,997
Chairman Ju? Then…

961
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:58,916
No, it wasn't me.

962
00:56:58,999 --> 00:57:02,336
Someone that great
wouldn't have just inquired with me.

963
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:03,671
Please don't get me wrong.

964
00:57:04,213 --> 00:57:05,214
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

965
00:57:14,223 --> 00:57:16,100
What a shame. Is the location that bad?

966
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,018
Is it in a different place?

967
00:57:19,228 --> 00:57:21,522
It's near the left collarbone.

968
00:57:21,605 --> 00:57:23,649
And the angiostenosis is too severe.

969
00:57:23,732 --> 00:57:27,027
If we don't stop
the blockage of blood flow in time,

970
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:30,531
-it would cause serious brain damage.
-That's right.

971
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:31,699
Yeah.

972
00:57:31,782 --> 00:57:34,201
What? Brain damage?

973
00:57:46,797 --> 00:57:48,048
No.

974
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:54,972
Dr. Rachel, please help me.

975
00:57:55,055 --> 00:57:56,182
Please.

976
00:57:56,265 --> 00:57:57,433
I'm begging you.

977
00:58:01,145 --> 00:58:02,771
Please, Doctor!

978
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:07,776
I'm sorry. I have to go.

979
00:58:08,861 --> 00:58:10,696
Doctor, no!

980
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:11,906
-Don't go. Please.
-Goddamn it!

981
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:12,823
Doctor!

982
00:58:12,907 --> 00:58:14,450
-What are you doing?
-Geez!

983
00:58:14,533 --> 00:58:16,410
-Don't touch her!
-Let go!

984
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,578
-Let her go!
-Move!

985
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:18,704
-Doctor!
-Let her go!

986
00:58:18,787 --> 00:58:20,497
Please don't go, Doctor!

987
00:58:20,581 --> 00:58:23,083
-Please, I'm begging you.
-Damn, that hurts.

988
00:58:24,335 --> 00:58:26,378
Doctor, please.

989
00:58:27,922 --> 00:58:30,549
Hey, has Chairman Ju
transferred the money yet?

990
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:32,384
Chairman Ju.

991
00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:36,347
He promised to deposit
$2 million by 3:00 p.m.

992
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:38,474
Two million dollars is 2.8 billion won.

993
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:40,893
For just one surgery?

994
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:45,189
By 3:00 p.m.?

995
00:58:47,399 --> 00:58:50,444
Chairman Ju's life is worth $2 million?

996
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:52,571
Then, how much is my life worth?

997
00:58:58,953 --> 00:59:00,412
Shall we get going?

998
00:59:01,580 --> 00:59:02,623
-Sure.
-Okay.

999
00:59:04,208 --> 00:59:05,167
Seon-mi.

1000
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,962
Are you going to give up
on Rachel like this?

1001
00:59:15,469 --> 00:59:16,971
I'll pay you $2.5 million!

1002
01:00:07,938 --> 01:00:09,773
Once the money's deposited,
we're taking off!

1003
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:11,233
It's missing one zero.

1004
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:15,070
I'll pay you the rest after surgery.

1005
01:00:15,154 --> 01:00:18,324
They're the best specialists.
You can count on them.

1006
01:00:18,407 --> 01:00:20,117
-It'll go well, right?
-Of course.

1007
01:00:20,909 --> 01:00:22,202
-What do we do?
-What else?

1008
01:00:22,286 --> 01:00:24,621
-Let's pack it in!
-Pack it in!

1009
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:27,166
What on earth?
They haven't even made a cut yet?

1010
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:29,376
He noticed you haven't cut her yet.

1011
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:31,045
Hey, gather around. Huddle up

1012
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:32,421
I think we're being filmed.

1013
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:33,339
What do we do?

1014
01:00:33,422 --> 01:00:34,965
We might as well do the surgery.

1015
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,301
All we have to do is not kill her.
