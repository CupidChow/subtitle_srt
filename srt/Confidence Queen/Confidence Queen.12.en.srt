1
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,434
Oh, thanks.

2
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:03,481
Sir.

3
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,068
Sit down, everyone.

4
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,701
You already know who I am.

5
00:01:17,703 --> 00:01:19,830
You're probably curious about who this is.

6
00:01:21,665 --> 00:01:24,919
He will be the CFO of this project
on my behalf

7
00:01:25,002 --> 00:01:29,590
since I stepped back.

8
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:31,967
This is Cho Jeong-hyeon.

9
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:35,513
Cho Jeong-hyeon?

10
00:01:35,971 --> 00:01:37,264
CFO?

11
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:39,850
I'm Cho Jeong-hyeon.

12
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:42,645
Through this group,

13
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:47,650
I will do my best to help more companies
in our country to sign contracts with ANK.

14
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:06,961
Since you saved my life...

15
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:07,878
FINAL EPISODE

16
00:02:07,962 --> 00:02:12,341
...I'll grant you a wish.

17
00:02:13,008 --> 00:02:15,261
When will you ever get what you want

18
00:02:15,344 --> 00:02:18,264
if you start as a new employee?

19
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:20,683
Wait, how did you know?

20
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:27,314
Well, seeing that
you were poking around here and there,

21
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:29,441
I thought you must've had a reason.

22
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:32,611
So, I had Lawyer Lee look into it.

23
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,990
HAKSAN LAW FIRM

24
00:02:48,085 --> 00:02:50,462
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

25
00:02:51,755 --> 00:02:53,883
CHO MAN-BOK

26
00:02:57,011 --> 00:03:00,347
You must seize your chance
when you have it.

27
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:01,974
Tell me

28
00:03:02,892 --> 00:03:04,602
anything you want.

29
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:15,112
Please help me, Chairman Cho.

30
00:03:16,363 --> 00:03:18,240
I want to take revenge.

31
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:32,796
We can include energy providers, Internet,
and digital companies for the city,

32
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,382
as well as major supermarkets
and department stores

33
00:03:35,466 --> 00:03:38,510
for daily living in the contract.

34
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:41,639
You're saying you'll help Korean companies
join this project

35
00:03:41,722 --> 00:03:44,266
under fairly favorable conditions.

36
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,938
I've only started the successor lesson.
I still have a long way to go.

37
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:57,905
That's why it's not easy for me
to keep my mouth shut, you know?

38
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,240
I'd appreciate it
if you'd pretend you didn't hear that.

39
00:04:02,534 --> 00:04:04,870
Then, shall we begin our first meeting?

40
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:06,830
1ST CONTRACT SUPPORTERS' MEETING

41
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,959
From now on, based on the best
existing architectural technology,

42
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:13,170
we'll build energy self-sufficient city
in the middle of a desert.

43
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:16,048
All the residential units
produced in modules

44
00:04:16,131 --> 00:04:18,592
will be produced in advance
and assembled on site.

45
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:22,972
Then, we can reduce the construction cost
by 30 percent and reduce…

46
00:04:23,055 --> 00:04:24,890
What are you trying to pull?

47
00:04:25,933 --> 00:04:27,851
Just don't get in my way.

48
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,603
…machinery, electricity, and pipe system.

49
00:04:30,646 --> 00:04:33,732
With AI-powered central control,

50
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:35,901
energy can be managed efficiently…

51
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:37,194
2ND CONTRACT SUPPORTERS' MEETING

52
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,029
…machinery, electricity, and pipe system.

53
00:04:39,113 --> 00:04:42,282
With AI-powered central control,

54
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:44,243
energy can be managed efficiently,

55
00:04:44,326 --> 00:04:48,288
making ANK's vision
of a zero-energy building possible.

56
00:04:48,372 --> 00:04:49,581
3RD CONTRACT SUPPORTERS' MEETING

57
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:51,792
Therefore, every one of us
participating in this project

58
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,003
isn't simply constructing a building,

59
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:57,548
but we will be pioneers
that will go down in history.

60
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:25,117
Hello.

61
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:32,499
Money sure is good.

62
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:35,586
It even got me
into the murderer's hideout.

63
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,022
Hey, what are you two…

64
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:59,193
doing?

65
00:06:01,195 --> 00:06:04,073
Are you all skipping dinner and working?

66
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:06,992
So, I brought you some snacks. I mean…

67
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:08,869
You didn't have to come.

68
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:13,290
I couldn't just sit on my hands

69
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,125
when you were all working so hard
on the design.

70
00:06:15,793 --> 00:06:18,420
Why don't you gather and have this meal?

71
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:21,507
I mean, some snacks. You too. Come over.

72
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,634
Let's take five!

73
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:26,887
A-reum, if you hadn't been in charge
of Chief Kang,

74
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,472
we couldn't have finished it on time.

75
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,390
No, I didn't do anything.

76
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,309
I'm learning a lot from all of you.

77
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:35,187
No, you were born with the skills
to buckle down.

78
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,147
Thank you. I'll try harder. We got this!

79
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,942
-Oh, you're so enthusiastic.
-Let's do it.

80
00:06:42,152 --> 00:06:45,322
-We can do it.
-We can do it.

81
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,830
-Do you like it?
-What?

82
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:56,500
Yes… What? What do you mean?

83
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:58,168
The design.

84
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:00,087
Oh, the design.

85
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:06,677
I wouldn't know much
even if I looked at it.

86
00:07:07,136 --> 00:07:08,554
I'm simply counting on you.

87
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:10,514
If you don't mind,

88
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:15,144
may I ask about your relation
to Chairman Cho?

89
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:18,063
Well…

90
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,441
It's been quite a while
since he adopted me.

91
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:28,782
That means I have the future chairman
of Jay Fund in front of me.

92
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,035
It's a pleasure to work with you.

93
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,037
The pleasure is mine, Chief Kang.

94
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,593
It seems my driver's taking time.
You should get going first.

95
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,553
Still, we can't leave you alone…

96
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:52,264
I'll see him off. Don't worry.

97
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,724
Will you do that?

98
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,394
Thanks for your help.
We'll see you tomorrow then.

99
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,022
-Thank you for the food.
-I'll see you tomorrow. Good work today.

100
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,447
Do you even know what CFO stands for?

101
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,618
The chief of finance.

102
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:14,786
So, you know.

103
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:16,747
By the way,

104
00:08:17,873 --> 00:08:19,541
why are you not using honorifics?

105
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,959
Do I know you?

106
00:08:24,254 --> 00:08:25,672
Jay Fund's Cho…

107
00:08:26,215 --> 00:08:27,466
What's your name again?

108
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,302
CFO Jeong-hyeon.

109
00:08:30,385 --> 00:08:34,598
How would a mere employee
know Mr. Cho Jeong-hyeon?

110
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,642
Then you need to watch your mouth.

111
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:39,811
How can you say "thanks" like that
to someone you've never met before?

112
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:43,565
Oh, thanks.

113
00:08:43,649 --> 00:08:46,360
You almost got me in trouble
from the beginning.

114
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:48,862
Avoid acting like an amateur, will you?

115
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:52,532
Anyway, how did you even get that spot?

116
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:59,039
Why don't you hop in?
I'll explain it to you on the way.

117
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,043
Oh, I wouldn't dare.

118
00:09:03,126 --> 00:09:04,628
Goodnight, sir.

119
00:09:10,926 --> 00:09:11,802
Shit.

120
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,682
Damn it.

121
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,475
-Hi.
-How's Gu-ho?

122
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,019
-What do you mean?
-Did he look okay?

123
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:22,479
How is he? Is he well?

124
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:23,438
Is he well?

125
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,651
He took too much protein, he bulked up.

126
00:09:27,734 --> 00:09:29,653
And he looks like a pelican
with his chin always up.

127
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,531
-He was a total eyesore.
-Okay, calm down.

128
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,075
-Where do you want me to pick you up?
-No.

129
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:38,495
I'd better be careful
until I win his full trust.

130
00:09:38,996 --> 00:09:40,580
Is my room ready?

131
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:43,292
Of course. I got you a perfect room.

132
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,759
What the hell is this?

133
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:56,096
-Who did this?
-How's the room? Do you like it?

134
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:57,472
Do I like it?

135
00:09:58,473 --> 00:09:59,433
Are you crazy?

136
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:02,060
The style you said.
What was it called again?

137
00:10:02,644 --> 00:10:05,522
Viva, viva! Yun Yi-rang's style.

138
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,815
What are they saying?

139
00:10:06,898 --> 00:10:08,400
That's the Gen Z style.

140
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:09,901
They decorated it themselves.

141
00:10:09,985 --> 00:10:12,321
For the perfect disguise.
You know what I mean?

142
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:14,156
Mr. Mustache put a lot of effort into it.

143
00:10:14,239 --> 00:10:17,951
I reflected my own taste,
but it's the Gen Z style for sure.

144
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:20,454
Okay. I'll bear with this.

145
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:22,205
But you'd better prepare it thoroughly.

146
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:25,917
Kang Yo-seop knows
how to manipulate people.

147
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:28,420
If anything goes wrong,
our plan will go in vain.

148
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:30,130
Okay, don't worry about that.

149
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:32,841
This is going to be
one hell of an operation.

150
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:35,677
-Get up!
-Get up!

151
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:37,637
Not "get up." Get it.

152
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:39,765
One, two, three!

153
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,438
Do I have to sleep here?

154
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:47,981
This is scary.

155
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,787
AUSPICIOUS GOSHIWON

156
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:05,123
She probably couldn't write
the goshiwon address.

157
00:11:05,207 --> 00:11:06,458
ADDRESS: SEOUN-SI UNJIRO-GIL 58

158
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,337
Because she's the same
type of person as me.

159
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,355
KOREAN GOVERNMENT

160
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,942
Please do your best on the presentation.

161
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:35,028
JOSEF ARCHITECTS

162
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,406
The design is finally ready.

163
00:11:38,115 --> 00:11:41,576
I prepared extra copies
of the presentation.

164
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,413
You'll be able to go through it
during the flight.

165
00:11:44,496 --> 00:11:45,664
Thank you, A-reum.

166
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:49,918
I'll do everything I can
to get the contract signed.

167
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,927
Chief Kang, I will now connect the call.

168
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:06,476
Thank you for going out of your way
to meet up on your busy day.

169
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,938
I was flustered to receive the call
so quickly.

170
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,648
We were expecting to wait a month.

171
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,109
I was surprised to hear
he wanted an immediate meeting.

172
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,069
Oh, there he is.

173
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:20,615
Peace be upon you too.

174
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,162
Applause.

175
00:13:37,234 --> 00:13:38,652
Any good ideas?

176
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:41,821
The more it takes, the higher the chance
of our contract going south.

177
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:43,490
I got to take a peep yesterday,

178
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:47,160
and he was going over the design proposal
from Summit High Engineering.

179
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:51,248
I also heard Jinyong Group in China
already has their design ready.

180
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,792
I expected us to be faster.

181
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:57,003
It seems other countries have been
preparing for it for a long time.

182
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,631
Anyone can smell the money.

183
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,841
Is there a way
to simplify the assembly method?

184
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:04,219
What we have right now is the best.

185
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,720
If we change the assembly method,

186
00:14:05,804 --> 00:14:07,681
the construction period
will expand indefinitely.

187
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:11,351
Chief Kang, are you saying
there is no alternative right now?

188
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:18,900
There is no problem that can't be solved.

189
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:23,572
There are only people too weak
to look for a solution.

190
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,801
Are you okay?

191
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,015
I'm a little dizzy.

192
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,058
You should get some rest outside.

193
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:54,603
Yes, if you'll excuse me.

194
00:15:03,278 --> 00:15:05,405
There is no problem that can't be solved.

195
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:09,909
There are only people too weak
to look for a solution.

196
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:18,918
How are you feeling?

197
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,837
I'm okay.

198
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:26,593
Oh, I have data that
I haven't reported to you yet.

199
00:15:26,676 --> 00:15:28,678
I thought you should check it.

200
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,689
This could be possible.

201
00:15:58,083 --> 00:15:59,709
The real game starts now.

202
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:03,213
You'd better be ready, Kang Yo-seop.

203
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:06,257
You can reduce it

204
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:09,052
to three years or even shorter?

205
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:10,512
I think it's possible.

206
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,223
Ms. Kim A-reum did a great job.

207
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:16,893
I will take care of this myself.

208
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,688
Of course. You know I'm counting on you,
Chief Kang.

209
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:26,903
You got something?

210
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,031
Oh, yes. This is data from Oracle.

211
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:32,033
This one is from Jay Fund,

212
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,369
and this is a list of reliable companies

213
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:37,580
that are currently working
on new material development.

214
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:46,464
Schedule a meeting.

215
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:47,841
Yes, sir.

216
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:50,468
Don't forget to send me
the contract draft.

217
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:51,845
Yes, sir.

218
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,245
Well, what is Salvador Rios like?

219
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:20,790
He's a third-generation Korean
with a Mexican grandfather

220
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:22,292
and a Korean grandmother.

221
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:25,003
Then, if we emphasize
that we're all Koreans,

222
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,672
-it'll be easier to seal the deal.
-That's no use.

223
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:33,595
He's notorious for demanding
even more money from Koreans in the field.

224
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:37,474
Wow, when did you research that?

225
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:41,811
I have a habit of researching everything
that is necessary for negotiations.

226
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,731
I think those are the basics, Mr. Cho.

227
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:49,527
Chief Kang, we may not have researched
his background enough,

228
00:17:49,611 --> 00:17:51,821
but we can support you financially
in full.

229
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,115
It feels reassuring to hear that.

230
00:17:54,616 --> 00:17:56,367
-We feel more reassured…
-He's here.

231
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:01,331
Where did he learn that wicked behavior?

232
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:41,538
Oh, delicious! Why is it so delicious?

233
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,126
I'm glad you like it.

234
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:54,300
What are your thoughts on the contract
that we sent you?

235
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:02,934
There's only one thing that I want.

236
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,609
Are you talking about the deposit?

237
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:16,698
Above all, money is important.

238
00:19:17,282 --> 00:19:19,284
-How much is that?
-About 20 billion won.

239
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:22,704
Why is he so surprised?

240
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,876
Until then, I won't do it.

241
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,544
I can't do it.

242
00:19:30,128 --> 00:19:32,088
Then, it's no use.

243
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,340
No use?

244
00:19:34,924 --> 00:19:37,302
All vain effort!

245
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:38,928
Vain effort?

246
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:50,440
Bye.

247
00:19:57,906 --> 00:20:01,034
Can we pay a 20 billion won deposit
with the government budget?

248
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:03,578
If I had a month, I might stand a chance.

249
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,914
But with things as they are now,
it's tough.

250
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:07,916
I'll call you back.

251
00:20:10,585 --> 00:20:13,004
-Okay. Bye.
-How did it go?

252
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,591
If we had the original contract,

253
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:19,719
we could mortgage our company building,
but it'll take three weeks.

254
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:23,139
We could also loan from the government,
but that would also take two weeks…

255
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,682
But we don't have the contract yet.

256
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,145
Mr. Cho, here.

257
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:32,023
I WILL START A FUNDRAISER

258
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,733
20 BILLION WON CAN BE PREPARED IN 5 DAYS

259
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:38,404
Chief Kang, I think we can prepare
20 billion won in five days.

260
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:42,408
Chairman Cho will start a fundraiser
with the retired chairpersons.

261
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:44,118
Okay.

262
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:45,578
-Thank you.
-Sure.

263
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,926
-Chief Kang, drive safe.
-Thank you for your work.

264
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:02,971
Thank you for your work.

265
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:04,889
Lawyer Lee, good night.

266
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,944
He keeps getting on my nerves
for some reason.

267
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,029
We need to talk.

268
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,418
Why are you acting like this?

269
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,795
-Seriously, keep your voice down.
-Hey.

270
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:39,674
If Chairman Cho provides the money,
what about our plan?

271
00:21:40,466 --> 00:21:41,342
"Our plan?"

272
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,136
Right.

273
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,430
My plan.

274
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:47,765
Then change your plan.

275
00:21:47,849 --> 00:21:51,185
Take revenge only on Kang Yo-seop.

276
00:21:51,978 --> 00:21:55,023
Why are you trying to damage
your innocent co-workers

277
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:56,983
when they adore you so much?

278
00:21:58,484 --> 00:22:00,611
Mr. Cho.

279
00:22:00,695 --> 00:22:03,656
It seems you're mistaken.

280
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:06,034
Now that you've become
Chairman Cho's adopted son,

281
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:09,370
do you not care about taking revenge,
and you're only after money?

282
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:13,624
Hey, Yun Yi-rang.
Seriously, what do you take me for?

283
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,710
How can you say that like it's nothing?

284
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:17,211
Seriously.

285
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:21,215
I have the perfect plan
to bring Kang Yo-seop down,

286
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,842
so stay out of it.

287
00:22:22,925 --> 00:22:23,926
What?

288
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:25,636
Hey.

289
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,973
Since when was this revenge yours?

290
00:22:29,057 --> 00:22:31,476
Kang Yo-seop, that bastard,
killed my father.

291
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,979
Oh, so your pain is bigger?

292
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:36,522
I never said that.

293
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:39,067
You have no idea
how much pain I was in, do you?

294
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:41,152
You never even cared to ask.

295
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:44,447
While you were having fun
at the theme park,

296
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,699
I was trapped in a dark, cramped attic,

297
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:49,827
forced to play games with men in masks,
pretending to be having fun,

298
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:52,914
never knowing if they'd kill me. Get it?

299
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:56,292
You were never curious
about how terrified I was.

300
00:22:58,753 --> 00:23:00,421
What about me
having to live without my dad?

301
00:23:01,089 --> 00:23:03,508
Tell me. Can you imagine a life like that?

302
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,802
Your father, whom you had
been waiting for, was murdered.

303
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,804
Would you have been able to handle it?

304
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:11,724
Ever since the day I was kidnapped

305
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,644
I've never been able to escape his power.

306
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:19,232
He's standing right before my eyes,
and I have to endure that!

307
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:20,483
No one told you to endure it!

308
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:23,444
Just stay out if you can't handle it!

309
00:23:24,112 --> 00:23:26,989
I don't even have the composure
to pay attention to your emotions.

310
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:31,202
Now that you're Cho Jeong-hyeon,
you've really changed.

311
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:38,668
Just stay out of this with that Silvador
or Salvador or whatever.

312
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,921
Or I'm going to tell him everything.

313
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,297
Hey, Myung Gu-ho!

314
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:52,765
Kim A-reum.

315
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:58,312
The more I think about it,
the cuter she is.

316
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:07,613
Yes, sir.

317
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:10,700
Check with Salvador and schedule dinner.

318
00:24:11,284 --> 00:24:13,369
Okay, what about the restaurant?

319
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,829
I'll send you the address.

320
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:17,874
Okay, I'll schedule it
and send you a text.

321
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:19,917
Okay. Thank you.

322
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:36,851
I prepared this meet-up to tell you

323
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:39,979
that the deposit you mentioned
will be ready soon.

324
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,901
And the rest…

325
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:49,488
The rest couldn't come due to other plans.
They sent their apologies.

326
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:55,077
I prefer it cosy.

327
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:56,704
Cosy just between us.

328
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,082
-Co… Is it cosy?
-Cozy.

329
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:02,627
Cozy. Very nice!

330
00:25:04,212 --> 00:25:05,755
You're very fluent in Korean.

331
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,216
No. I'm not fluent in Korean.

332
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:09,592
I'm a fool.

333
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:12,637
You knew how to say
"vain effort" last time.

334
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,181
-I think you're fluent in Korean.
-Oh, that.

335
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:18,434
Vain effort!

336
00:25:19,101 --> 00:25:20,102
Very good.

337
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:21,938
My grandma was Korean.

338
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,191
So… Listening? A little.

339
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,821
Why can't I do it?

340
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:34,617
You're very good.

341
00:25:35,201 --> 00:25:36,911
Is it okay? Thank you.

342
00:25:38,329 --> 00:25:39,830
If you're done with your meal,

343
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:41,916
I prepared something special.

344
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:44,710
-Shall we go downstairs?
-Okay.

345
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:00,059
I like to play chess.

346
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:08,901
A-reum, do you know how to play chess?

347
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:13,698
Whoever beats me plays with Salvador.

348
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:15,032
What do you say?

349
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,021
Found you.

350
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:47,064
Too bad. I won again.

351
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:50,443
Since you lost, you need to be punished.

352
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,491
What's wrong?
Are you feeling unwell again?

353
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:02,580
No, it's because
I stayed up all night last night.

354
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:05,875
Do you feel shitty

355
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:09,295
that you still can't beat me in chess?

356
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:15,217
Yun Yi-rang.

357
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:25,728
What?

358
00:27:27,396 --> 00:27:28,606
You knew?

359
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,655
I knew something was fishy
when our Mr. Salvador,

360
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:39,867
who couldn't speak English well,
asked for 15 million dollars.

361
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:42,161
It was pretty sloppy.

362
00:27:45,498 --> 00:27:48,709
That meant he knew the amount
I could spare.

363
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:50,169
Why are you acting like this?

364
00:27:50,252 --> 00:27:53,005
You think I didn't recognize you
when you were so sloppy?

365
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:56,175
If Chairman Cho provides the money,
what about our plan?

366
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:59,470
Take revenge only on Kang Yo-seop.

367
00:28:00,012 --> 00:28:01,931
Take revenge on me?

368
00:28:02,014 --> 00:28:04,850
Since when was this revenge yours?

369
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:07,436
Kang Yo-seop, that bastard,
killed my father.

370
00:28:11,524 --> 00:28:12,400
Myung Gu-ho?

371
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:17,113
He's Myung Jin-su's son, Myung Gu-ho?

372
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,120
And you, Yi-rang's bodyguard.

373
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:28,541
You're having a hard time
acting silly at that age.

374
00:28:28,624 --> 00:28:30,334
-Shut up.
-Anyway,

375
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:33,295
these two entertained me so much.

376
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:34,922
What are you talking about?

377
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:38,217
Your life is ruined just as I expected.

378
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:41,053
I'm very pleased.

379
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:42,721
Shut up, you bastard!

380
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,684
I saw this coming and prepared for it.

381
00:28:46,767 --> 00:28:48,477
-Mr. Ray-bang.
-Shut up!

382
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,938
Keep your mouths shut.

383
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,064
Don't move.

384
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:53,315
Who are you people?

385
00:28:53,399 --> 00:28:55,526
You think I brought you here
without a plan?

386
00:28:58,529 --> 00:28:59,447
What do you think?

387
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:02,324
I tried to bring back the mood.

388
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:10,708
Remember?

389
00:29:16,338 --> 00:29:17,173
Yi-rang.

390
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:19,258
Are you okay? You bastard!

391
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:33,314
Even together,
your chances of revenge were slim.

392
00:29:35,357 --> 00:29:37,318
And yet, you went overboard, Gu-ho.

393
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,571
You piece of shit.

394
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:43,115
Hey, I'm disappointed.

395
00:29:44,074 --> 00:29:46,952
You used to light up with a smile
whenever you saw me.

396
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:01,717
-You must be Gu-ho.
-Do you know me?

397
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:03,719
Of course, I know you very well.

398
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:08,682
Your daddy wanted to buy you
nice clothes and toys,

399
00:30:08,766 --> 00:30:11,602
and send you to a taekwondo academy
when you got into elementary school,

400
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,312
so he couldn't get off the ship.

401
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,566
I knew he wasn't going to come again.

402
00:30:18,150 --> 00:30:20,277
-But he told this uncle…
-Uncle?

403
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:23,739
I don't have an uncle.
Are you close to my dad?

404
00:30:25,199 --> 00:30:27,034
Of course, we are.

405
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,954
You're supposed to call people
who are close to your dad, uncles.

406
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:34,708
He asked me to take you to the theme park.

407
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:39,004
There's a big theme park in Seoul
called Any World.

408
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:40,631
Did you say Any World?

409
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:47,680
What…

410
00:30:48,931 --> 00:30:50,975
would have happened
if you hadn't taken my hand?

411
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:58,315
Then I would've looked for someone else.

412
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,693
And it wouldn't have been your dad to die.

413
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:02,194
He's talking shit.

414
00:31:02,278 --> 00:31:03,862
-Don't listen to him, Gu-ho.
-Why?

415
00:31:03,946 --> 00:31:06,198
Are you worried
that he'd be traumatized like you?

416
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,203
Then, let me make it clear to him.

417
00:31:12,121 --> 00:31:14,248
Your dad died because of you, Myung Gu-ho.

418
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:15,416
You bastard!

419
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:20,004
Because you took my hand back then,
I was able to get the reward easily.

420
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:23,424
Thanks to you, I'm living happily,
as you can see.

421
00:31:23,507 --> 00:31:25,426
You piece of shit.

422
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:28,262
Are you done?

423
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:32,725
Don't act like you didn't know,
you ungrateful bastard.

424
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:37,938
-No, Gu-ho.
-No, Gu-ho!

425
00:31:38,022 --> 00:31:39,315
-Gu-ho, don't do that.
-No!

426
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,858
Gu-ho, don't!

427
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:42,985
-Put the gun down!
-Put the gun down, you bastard!

428
00:31:45,195 --> 00:31:46,155
Shoot me.

429
00:31:47,114 --> 00:31:48,490
I'll kill you, you bastard.

430
00:31:49,199 --> 00:31:50,200
What?

431
00:31:50,993 --> 00:31:52,620
Are you scared to shoot me?

432
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,954
You can't do it?

433
00:31:58,292 --> 00:31:59,376
Do it. Shoot me!

434
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,462
Shut up, you son of a bitch.

435
00:32:01,545 --> 00:32:05,257
If you shoot me now, they'll all die.

436
00:32:07,593 --> 00:32:08,469
Shoot me.

437
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:36,038
Why do cowboys count
when they're having a duel?

438
00:32:38,582 --> 00:32:41,460
One, two, three.

439
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:43,671
Bang.

440
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:58,727
No!

441
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,646
Gu-ho!

442
00:33:00,729 --> 00:33:02,731
You motherfucker!

443
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,025
I'll kill you, you bastard!

444
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:10,322
Yi-rang, this is where you go down
on your knees and beg.

445
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:12,950
Shut the fuck up, you asshole.

446
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:14,910
Call an ambulance! Now!

447
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:16,578
Why would I do that?

448
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:19,415
All of you must die here for me to live.

449
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:22,084
We'll pretend nothing happened,
so call the ambulance!

450
00:33:22,167 --> 00:33:25,003
So, why make a fuss about taking revenge?

451
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:27,005
He's dying because of you.

452
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:29,299
Just like how his dad died because of him,

453
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:30,759
he's dying because of you.

454
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:31,802
All because of you!

455
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:32,720
Shut up!

456
00:33:45,441 --> 00:33:47,818
CHIEF SECRETARY BAEK HYEON-UK

457
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:49,862
Yes?

458
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,156
Chief Kang, Abdullah just arrived
for the contract.

459
00:33:52,239 --> 00:33:54,450
-Abdullah? Now?
-Yes.

460
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:55,784
Okay, bye.

461
00:33:56,285 --> 00:33:58,996
-Gu-ho.
-Gu-ho, wake up.

462
00:33:59,079 --> 00:34:00,581
-Gu-ho.
-Wake up.

463
00:34:00,664 --> 00:34:02,833
-I…
-Don't talk.

464
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,209
You don't have to say anything.

465
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:08,589
But I'm happy that both of you are here.

466
00:34:09,673 --> 00:34:12,426
Keep them here until I'm back.
I'll be back soon.

467
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:13,969
What if he dies?

468
00:34:14,845 --> 00:34:15,804
That'd be his fate.

469
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,557
-Gu-ho.
-Gu-ho.

470
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,600
Gu-ho!

471
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:23,187
I'll kill you, Kang Yo-seop!

472
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:19,993
Chief Kang.

473
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:22,287
Hello.

474
00:35:23,413 --> 00:35:24,498
-Have a seat.
-Okay.

475
00:35:31,755 --> 00:35:34,633
Oh, you got something on your face.

476
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:38,387
Oh, I must've cut myself while shaving.

477
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:42,266
How did it go with Salvador?

478
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,768
His company actually turned out
to have an issue.

479
00:35:44,852 --> 00:35:47,479
So, I'm planning to sign a contract
with a company from India.

480
00:35:47,563 --> 00:35:49,064
That won't affect our deal today, right?

481
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:52,901
Don't worry. I'll explain it to him.

482
00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:55,904
I can't believe Abdullah is coming
in person to sign the contract.

483
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:58,866
He must've really liked your design.

484
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:01,785
It's all thanks to your hard work.

485
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:03,912
Congratulations in advance.

486
00:36:07,457 --> 00:36:10,127
I can't believe something like this
is happening in my life.

487
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:12,421
Oh, there he is.

488
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,858
Open it.

489
00:36:33,734 --> 00:36:36,445
Abdullah wanted to share his heart
with you through this gift.

490
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:37,529
You should open it.

491
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,557
Peace be upon you.

492
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:07,976
My darling.

493
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,580
What does it feel like
to have the tables turned on you?

494
00:37:30,666 --> 00:37:32,334
What have you done?

495
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:35,796
Where should I start
to help you understand quickly?

496
00:37:37,798 --> 00:37:39,341
Peace be upon you.

497
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,767
I'll tell you how Gu-ho and I reconciled.

498
00:37:56,817 --> 00:37:57,734
Gu-ho.

499
00:38:01,947 --> 00:38:03,573
I'm sorry.

500
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,160
I didn't want you

501
00:38:08,328 --> 00:38:10,998
to experience the same hurt I did.

502
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:13,834
I was wishing you'd never find out.

503
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,380
Hey, why are you crying here?

504
00:38:19,506 --> 00:38:20,340
I'm sorry.

505
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:25,053
Well, I'm sorry, too.

506
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:27,764
Do you…

507
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:30,976
want to go meet James?

508
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:34,730
That's how we got back together
and became a team again.

509
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:37,149
And on the way to your summer house,

510
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:40,819
we had already received information
and had a plan.

511
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:41,903
Open the door!

512
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:43,530
Open up!

513
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,121
These are customized guns.
Be careful with them.

514
00:38:57,627 --> 00:38:58,670
Bang.

515
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,549
-No.
-Gu-ho!

516
00:39:02,632 --> 00:39:04,843
You motherfucker!

517
00:39:04,926 --> 00:39:06,720
I'll kill you, you bastard!

518
00:39:06,803 --> 00:39:08,096
Gu-ho!

519
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,183
Gu-ho!

520
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:15,687
What about Abdullah,
the one we had a video call with?

521
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:17,814
That was a deepfake and a deepvoice.

522
00:39:17,898 --> 00:39:19,024
It was perfect.

523
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,490
I have thoroughly reviewed
the Mega Eco City design

524
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,408
that was sent from South Korea.

525
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:31,578
As I expected, my prediction was correct.

526
00:39:32,329 --> 00:39:37,959
-The idea of placing the communal garden…
-…multi-angle views and facilitates

527
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:45,300
Do you know how many times
I had to switch my makeup because of you?

528
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,512
What about the Minister of Land,
Infrastructure, and Transport?

529
00:39:51,973 --> 00:39:53,141
The chief secretary…

530
00:39:53,725 --> 00:39:55,435
Hyeon-uk, thanks for your work.
You can go now.

531
00:39:56,019 --> 00:39:56,853
Bye.

532
00:39:57,938 --> 00:39:58,855
Sorry.

533
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:01,108
James is an expert in this field.

534
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:03,610
Of course, do you know how busy I was?

535
00:40:03,693 --> 00:40:04,653
Sweetie.

536
00:40:09,491 --> 00:40:11,785
-I missed you.
-I missed you, too.

537
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,703
You look so pretty today. Let's go.

538
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:19,084
I sent you to check on their movements,
and you completely fell for her.

539
00:40:20,377 --> 00:40:21,294
Stop it.

540
00:40:22,337 --> 00:40:23,171
Isn't that it?

541
00:40:23,255 --> 00:40:26,216
It's coming. That one.

542
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:29,886
Take pictures. They're out of the car.

543
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,723
The face. Look here, please.

544
00:40:34,182 --> 00:40:36,768
There. Okay. We got it.

545
00:40:44,192 --> 00:40:45,110
Eun-u?

546
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:47,487
Yes, sweetie.

547
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,407
I have some business with Hyeon-uk today.

548
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:53,743
Hyeon-uk, you look great
in these pictures.

549
00:40:53,827 --> 00:40:55,537
It's almost like a magazine shoot.

550
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,498
Your wife would love it.

551
00:40:59,166 --> 00:41:01,376
What? I thought you got divorced twice.

552
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,796
That's not the point right now.

553
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,883
Chief Secretary of the Minister of Land,
Infrastructure, and Transport.

554
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,552
-How did you know that?
-Did you…

555
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,305
use me?

556
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:15,473
Is this what you meant
when you said "affair"?

557
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:17,309
I'm disappointed.

558
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:23,732
See you.

559
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:25,901
-Sweetie.
-Sweetie, my foot.

560
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:28,069
Watch your mouth.

561
00:41:29,905 --> 00:41:32,199
You tied the knot

562
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:36,620
with that great Congressman Kim Jin-su's
second daughter two months ago.

563
00:41:37,454 --> 00:41:39,080
Please help me.

564
00:41:39,581 --> 00:41:43,126
If my father-in-law finds out,
I could die without a trace.

565
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,377
Please help me just this once.

566
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:48,006
-It's sad to have a newlywed die.
-Right.

567
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:50,550
This is probably better than dying.

568
00:41:55,055 --> 00:41:56,389
Why is this…

569
00:41:56,473 --> 00:41:58,808
-Just take it.
-It'll come in handy.

570
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,896
WASH & HAPPY

571
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:05,649
Hey, Hyeon-uk, are you ready?

572
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,109
Make one wrong move,

573
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:10,612
and your wife will get to see
the photos of you having an affair.

574
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:13,490
Don't do anything stupid. Let's get it!

575
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:21,873
The Minister would like
to speak with you urgently.

576
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:23,875
The Minister of Land,
Infrastructure, and Transport?

577
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:25,710
May I connect you to him?

578
00:42:26,253 --> 00:42:28,129
Let's say that phone call was deepvoice.

579
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:30,215
But he showed up in person.

580
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:33,009
The Minister thought
the private contract supporters

581
00:42:33,093 --> 00:42:36,388
were just a private organization
you formed,

582
00:42:36,471 --> 00:42:38,348
so he simply stopped by
to show his support.

583
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,766
Oh, that reminds me.

584
00:42:39,849 --> 00:42:43,895
Oracle Engineering CEO Lee and I have been
best friends since we were little.

585
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:45,188
What about Chairman Cho?

586
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:47,274
We saw your greed

587
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:51,319
in wanting to build utopia
through Mega Eco City…

588
00:42:51,403 --> 00:42:54,155
We sneaked into the goshiwon
where Chairman Cho was staying.

589
00:42:55,031 --> 00:42:57,242
If Chairman Cho had joined the project,

590
00:42:57,325 --> 00:42:59,160
you wouldn't have been able
to help but buy it.

591
00:42:59,244 --> 00:43:01,454
I want to take revenge.

592
00:43:03,331 --> 00:43:07,085
Gu-ho did his best,
but he wasn't good enough on his own.

593
00:43:12,173 --> 00:43:16,428
Chairman Cho Man-bok of Jay Fund
is actually my dad's best friend.

594
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:20,432
Uncle Man-bok, will you help us?

595
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:22,642
I'm an heir to a family empire.

596
00:43:22,726 --> 00:43:24,352
-What?
-You haven't forgotten, right?

597
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:29,024
The pretty lady upstairs, Yun Yi-rang.

598
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:33,653
I heard a pretty girl moved in
on the women's floor.

599
00:43:33,737 --> 00:43:37,866
Stop minding that
and focus on your teacher's exam.

600
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:40,452
Yun Yi-rang is basically my niece.

601
00:43:40,535 --> 00:43:44,414
I've known her since she was little.
You can say she's pretty much my niece.

602
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:46,291
How's your father doing?

603
00:43:46,374 --> 00:43:51,254
I was waiting for my chance to tell you,
and it got out of control.

604
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:52,714
My goodness.

605
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:58,470
Without Manager Gu, I'd be dead already.

606
00:43:58,553 --> 00:44:02,098
Should I say the universe helped us?

607
00:44:05,727 --> 00:44:06,895
Come on.

608
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:14,110
This is all fake, you know?

609
00:44:15,653 --> 00:44:18,782
We're not brothers by blood,

610
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:21,242
but bonded by loyalty,

611
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:23,745
so we don't easily collapse
or break apart.

612
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:28,249
An opportunist and a murderer like you

613
00:44:28,333 --> 00:44:30,710
would never get to feel this
in a million years.

614
00:44:30,794 --> 00:44:31,628
That's right.

615
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,259
So, you think you can push me
to the bottomless pit?

616
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:40,804
Well, who else is here besides us?

617
00:44:44,849 --> 00:44:47,185
If you apologize now, I'll accept it.

618
00:44:47,268 --> 00:44:48,269
Me?

619
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:50,438
Why do I need to apologize?

620
00:44:50,522 --> 00:44:51,981
For what you did to me…

621
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:56,361
25 years ago.

622
00:45:03,368 --> 00:45:04,577
Are you recording this?

623
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:07,414
Are you telling me to false-testify?

624
00:45:08,915 --> 00:45:13,211
Don't tell me you forgot about the game
you created just to kidnap me.

625
00:45:13,294 --> 00:45:15,004
What are you talking about?

626
00:45:15,088 --> 00:45:17,841
Why would I do that?

627
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:23,763
I knew it.

628
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:28,476
I knew you wouldn't apologize.

629
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,272
Why are you doing this to me?

630
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:35,024
Why?

631
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:42,824
To buy time.

632
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,243
PARK JU-SEONG
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

633
00:45:46,953 --> 00:45:48,246
RESTRICTED NUMBER

634
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,001
What's this?

635
00:45:57,046 --> 00:45:59,883
-Hello?
-Hello, Chief Detective Park Ju-seong.

636
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:01,468
Who is this?

637
00:46:01,551 --> 00:46:03,052
Long time no see. This is Seo In-jae.

638
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:06,890
-Seo In-jae?
-You're retiring soon.

639
00:46:07,974 --> 00:46:09,767
Let me offer you a retirement gift.

640
00:46:10,226 --> 00:46:11,311
What retirement…

641
00:46:11,853 --> 00:46:13,813
Hello?

642
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:19,527
YUN YI-RANG, MYUNG GU-HO
THE TRUTH BEHIND THEIR ABDUCTION

643
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:27,660
Your dad died because of you, Myung Gu-ho.

644
00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:32,790
Because you took my hand back then,
I was able to get the reward easily.

645
00:46:32,874 --> 00:46:35,585
Thanks to you, I'm living happily,
as you can see.

646
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:37,295
You fucking piece of shit.

647
00:46:39,172 --> 00:46:41,090
GRAND PEACE HOTEL

648
00:46:41,174 --> 00:46:43,843
The culprit is at the cafe
in Grand Peace Hotel.

649
00:46:43,927 --> 00:46:45,553
This bastard.

650
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:47,889
This case has haunted me my entire career.

651
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:51,100
Hey! Over here.

652
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:57,982
Kang Yo-seop.

653
00:46:58,942 --> 00:47:00,401
You're under arrest

654
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:03,404
for kidnapping Yun Yi-rang
and murdering Myung Jin-su

655
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:04,906
25 years ago.

656
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:07,450
Do you have evidence?

657
00:47:07,534 --> 00:47:08,451
Evidence?

658
00:47:10,537 --> 00:47:13,998
We already secured the evidence,
you idiot.

659
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:19,295
As far as I'm concerned,
that incident took place in April 2000.

660
00:47:19,379 --> 00:47:21,798
The statute of limitations
has already run out.

661
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:25,343
You can tell me that nonsense
at the station quietly.

662
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:27,011
Hey!

663
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:34,185
Everyone, don't move.

664
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,651
You left for Germany
after the incident, right?

665
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:42,735
For about two years?

666
00:47:44,112 --> 00:47:45,071
While you were abroad,

667
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,782
the statute of limitations was suspended.

668
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:52,161
So, it still has one year left, you idiot!

669
00:47:52,245 --> 00:47:53,871
-Got it, you idiot?
-What?

670
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:56,374
What in the world…

671
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:07,051
Are you out of your mind?
That's fake, you idiot.

672
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:09,971
-You haven't learned your lesson.
-Darn it.

673
00:48:12,557 --> 00:48:14,726
Hey, what are you doing? Chase him!

674
00:48:14,809 --> 00:48:16,477
-Hurry up and get him.
-Yes, sir.

675
00:48:24,694 --> 00:48:25,695
Stop!

676
00:48:33,244 --> 00:48:34,120
Hey!

677
00:48:36,164 --> 00:48:37,665
-Open the door.
-Stop what you're doing.

678
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:46,674
No!

679
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:02,523
Yun Yi-rang.

680
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,318
You want to catch me?

681
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:22,627
I can always find a way.

682
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:37,266
What the heck…

683
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:42,689
If you committed a crime,
you need to pay for it.

684
00:49:44,357 --> 00:49:45,400
Fuck.

685
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:47,985
Although it's too late.

686
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,154
What the hell?

687
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:54,492
What are you going to do?

688
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,411
You're done for.

689
00:49:57,078 --> 00:50:00,206
The final winner of this game is me.

690
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:04,502
No. It's not over yet.

691
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:08,423
Wait and see who wins in the end.

692
00:50:17,098 --> 00:50:19,392
No, you can't beat me.

693
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:22,395
Sure. Bring it on.

694
00:50:23,396 --> 00:50:24,731
It's not over yet.

695
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:28,359
It's not over yet!

696
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:48,004
Hey, hurry up.

697
00:50:50,173 --> 00:50:51,382
Request support.

698
00:50:51,466 --> 00:50:53,468
Tell them it's urgent,
so send the search team first.

699
00:50:58,139 --> 00:51:00,433
After a month-long search,
the police recovered the car

700
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:06,355
of Josef Architects' CEO, Kang Yo-seop,
which had plunged off a bridge.

701
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:09,358
Kang's whereabouts remain unknown,

702
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:11,402
and with no further trace of him…

703
00:51:11,486 --> 00:51:14,030
You were a coward to the end,
Kang Yo-seop.

704
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:19,952
Until the incident, Kang had been active
in his role as CEO of Josef Architects…

705
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:27,251
Well done, everyone, for your hard work
these past few months!

706
00:51:27,335 --> 00:51:29,796
-Well done.
-Well done.

707
00:51:30,463 --> 00:51:33,132
-Good job!
-Thank you.

708
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:35,051
Here.

709
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:36,969
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

710
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:46,479
When I stayed away for the operation,
I learned that I can't

711
00:51:46,562 --> 00:51:47,688
do anything without you.

712
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:49,023
-You can.
-What?

713
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,274
-You can.
-What do you mean?

714
00:51:50,358 --> 00:51:52,735
You were doing well with that pretty lady.

715
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:54,946
Should we call that
a middle-aged romance or…

716
00:51:55,029 --> 00:51:56,864
Oh, a middle-aged romance.

717
00:51:56,948 --> 00:51:58,991
-A middle-aged romance.
-A middle…

718
00:51:59,075 --> 00:52:00,159
Quiet!

719
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:03,204
I was only focusing on my role.

720
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:06,707
Sure, he was unnecessarily immersed
in his role.

721
00:52:06,791 --> 00:52:09,377
That's right. I was immersed in the role.

722
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,254
No, you just wanted to be in love.

723
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:13,172
The coolest one was Gu-ho.

724
00:52:13,256 --> 00:52:14,465
Jay Fund's successor?

725
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:17,718
Hey, Gu-ho, you were born with it.

726
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:19,136
-It suit me, right?
-Yes.

727
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:20,805
-You were really annoying.
-What?

728
00:52:20,888 --> 00:52:24,016
I only want a role like this.
It was a perfect fit.

729
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,601
What are you talking about?

730
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:26,602
Cheers.

731
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:29,981
-Gosh, it's finally over.
-Says who?

732
00:52:30,898 --> 00:52:31,732
It's not over yet?

733
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:32,733
It's not over?

734
00:52:33,484 --> 00:52:34,819
-No.
-What do you mean?

735
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,281
It's only the beginning.

736
00:52:39,031 --> 00:52:41,951
Hey, I thought we were on vacation
starting today.

737
00:52:42,577 --> 00:52:43,911
I have a homecoming party.

738
00:52:44,662 --> 00:52:45,955
-Where?
-Seocho-dong.

739
00:52:46,038 --> 00:52:46,998
What?

740
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:50,126
-Why are you going to Seocho-dong?
-You're from Seoul?

741
00:52:50,209 --> 00:52:52,879
I was raised in Seocho-dong.
Didn't you know?

742
00:52:52,962 --> 00:52:55,381
-Then why do you speak in a dialect?
-Did I?

743
00:52:56,632 --> 00:52:57,884
Actually,

744
00:52:58,634 --> 00:53:01,470
I'm going to attend
a summer church camp, too.

745
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:02,847
Oh, Amen.

746
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:06,392
I'm going on an overnight trip…

747
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:07,727
With your girlfriend?

748
00:53:08,394 --> 00:53:09,228
Yes.

749
00:53:09,312 --> 00:53:10,730
-Geez.
-It happened.

750
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:12,273
Hold on, everyone.

751
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:14,191
This round is pretty big.

752
00:53:14,275 --> 00:53:16,193
I'd say double the usual.

753
00:53:16,277 --> 00:53:17,862
-Double.
-Double!

754
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:19,530
-We must go, then.
-Then I'm in.

755
00:53:19,614 --> 00:53:20,698
How exciting.

756
00:53:20,781 --> 00:53:22,199
For this round,

757
00:53:22,283 --> 00:53:26,037
I heard Salvator Mundi
by Leonardo da Vinci was out

758
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,080
on the Hong Kong black market.

759
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:32,209
Isn't Salvator Mundi a painting
that Samjin Group owned?

760
00:53:32,293 --> 00:53:34,420
Wait, isn't Samjin Group the awful company

761
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:36,672
that put the blame
for discharging wastewater

762
00:53:36,756 --> 00:53:38,549
-on their mere employee?
-You got it.

763
00:53:39,050 --> 00:53:41,218
That was the chairman's son's doing.

764
00:53:41,302 --> 00:53:43,262
But now that it's about to be revealed,

765
00:53:43,346 --> 00:53:46,557
they're playing a stupid trick to sell
the posthumous work to cash in on it.

766
00:53:46,641 --> 00:53:48,559
-A stupid trick.
-No matter how hard we work,

767
00:53:48,643 --> 00:53:51,228
these pieces of garbage
just won't disappear.

768
00:53:51,312 --> 00:53:53,230
That's why people like us are needed.

769
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:54,148
That's right.

770
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,524
Then, is everyone in?

771
00:53:55,608 --> 00:53:56,984
-Of course, we're in.
-All right.

772
00:53:57,068 --> 00:53:58,361
-I'm in.
-Okay!

773
00:53:58,444 --> 00:53:59,737
Now, shall we get started?

774
00:54:59,588 --> 00:55:03,968
PARK MIN-YOUNG
AS YUN YI-RANG

775
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:14,979
PARK HEE-SOON
AS JAMES

776
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:26,490
JOO JONG-HYUK
AS GU-HO

777
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:34,540
Confidence Queen will be back.
