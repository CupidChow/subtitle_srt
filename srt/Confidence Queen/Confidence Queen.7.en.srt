1
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,023
Hang in there. I'll save you soon.

2
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:09,278
Just a bit more. I can go home now.

3
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,554
James!

4
00:01:40,976 --> 00:01:41,936
Yi-rang, run!

5
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:50,236
Yi-rang!

6
00:03:28,918 --> 00:03:29,752
One second.

7
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:48,771
It seems Team Lead Lee Seong-min
was the inside man.

8
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,439
Really? Okay.

9
00:03:52,608 --> 00:03:53,817
Who was that call from?

10
00:03:56,528 --> 00:03:57,613
It's my wife.

11
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:20,886
SEOUL FIRE DEPARTMENT

12
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,906
She's showing sensitivity to light
due to aftereffects from the incident.

13
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,994
Our biggest concern is whether
her dissociative disorder will persist.

14
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:48,914
We'll have to monitor her
through ongoing psychotherapy.

15
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,888
Yi-rang, I'm sorry.

16
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,558
I arrived too late.

17
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,521
Everything's going to be okay.

18
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:22,698
Yun Yi-rang, the daughter of Rine's CEO
whose kidnapping gripped the nation,

19
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:26,410
was dramatically rescued after five days.

20
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:30,164
Shockingly, it turned out
that the suspect who died at the scene

21
00:05:30,247 --> 00:05:31,999
was the leader
of the girl's bodyguard team.

22
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:36,003
Fortunately, Yi-rang did not receive
any major injuries and is resting.

23
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:39,590
The police believe this kidnapping
may have been committed by a group

24
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:43,052
and plan to hold additional investigations
for possible accomplices.

25
00:05:43,135 --> 00:05:44,303
Congressman Park Gyu-taek!

26
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,930
-Step down right now!
-Step down!

27
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:48,057
MARCH 2020

28
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,391
He's going in. Get ready.

29
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:51,143
Wake up, Park Gyu-taek!

30
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,395
-Wake up!
-Wake up!

31
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:55,689
Real estate speculation and lease fraud!
Park Gyu-taek!

32
00:05:55,773 --> 00:05:56,899
Step down!

33
00:05:56,982 --> 00:05:58,233
-Step down!
-Step down!

34
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,569
I'm a three-term congressman.
How could you bring me here?

35
00:06:00,652 --> 00:06:01,987
My apologies, sir.

36
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:04,865
This is a core district,
so for the next election…

37
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,992
Let's just say a few words
as greetings and end it.

38
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:07,910
Yes, sir.

39
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:10,412
Also, tell the host
not to ask me any questions.

40
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:11,789
Yes, sir. I'll make sure.

41
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,627
CONFISCATE ALL PROFITS!

42
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,797
You bastard! Die!

43
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,881
Hey! Cover him!

44
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,481
For Christ's sake.

45
00:06:38,232 --> 00:06:39,983
You couldn't even stop that.

46
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,945
You can't do anything right!

47
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,530
Geez, it stinks.

48
00:06:44,613 --> 00:06:46,907
How disgusting. Get out of my sight!

49
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:51,870
Disgusting?

50
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,916
God, I'm so sick of this.

51
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,252
Who do you think
caused this mess in the first place?

52
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,629
What did you just say, you punk?

53
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,047
Are you out of your mind?

54
00:07:03,841 --> 00:07:05,050
Gosh, did you hear that?

55
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:08,137
I thought your ears were clogged up,
but I guess not.

56
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,763
If you had such good hearing,

57
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:12,307
how come you can't listen to the people?

58
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:15,227
Has this punk seriously lost his mind?

59
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,272
Hey, fire this punk. Now!

60
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,731
What a damn lunatic.

61
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,402
Who says you can fire me?

62
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,821
I'm quitting first.

63
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:27,823
Got it?

64
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:29,491
What are you…

65
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,827
I'm quitting.

66
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:34,454
Geez, you stink.

67
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:35,914
You reek like rotten trash.

68
00:07:38,917 --> 00:07:40,502
Let's never meet again.

69
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,546
You disgusting jerk.

70
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,298
Sir.

71
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,633
That lunatic!

72
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,014
Who am I?

73
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:52,931
Where am I?

74
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,853
What am I doing with my damn life?

75
00:08:00,981 --> 00:08:01,815
Geez.

76
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:08,572
Damn it.

77
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:10,115
Geez!

78
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:15,370
Nothing ever works out, damn it.

79
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,299
You're still living like this?

80
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:39,061
God, I'm going to lose my mind today.

81
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:44,024
Who are you
and why are you speaking informally to me?

82
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:50,113
I'm disappointed, James.

83
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:55,202
You got the wrong person.

84
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,912
I'm not James. I'm Seo In…

85
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,623
I'm not James. I'm Seo In-jae.

86
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,417
If you say Seo In-jae backwards,
it's Jae-in Seo.

87
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:03,794
It sounds like James.

88
00:09:08,423 --> 00:09:09,383
Yun Yi-rang?

89
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:11,885
Long time no see, mister.

90
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,139
Yi-rang!

91
00:09:17,266 --> 00:09:18,684
Let's pretend we hugged.

92
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,521
Seeing how prickly you are,
you really are Yi-rang.

93
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:27,859
Hey, mister.

94
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:30,070
Let's work together.

95
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:33,115
What? What are you talking about?

96
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,535
Find this person for me.

97
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:42,541
But we just met after 20 years
and suddenly this?

98
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:53,969
Who is…

99
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:56,221
Oh, this man.

100
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,642
I have something to report.

101
00:10:00,726 --> 00:10:03,812
Yes, the man who left
with the three-billion-won reward money,

102
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:05,564
Myung Jin-su.

103
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:07,858
Right. I remember.

104
00:10:07,941 --> 00:10:10,235
The CEO… I mean, your father.

105
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:12,154
He even had dinner with your father.

106
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,531
Anyway, why are you looking for him?

107
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,327
You know I hate to lose.

108
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,872
What are you saying? I don't understand--

109
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,957
A game called abduction

110
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,917
staged by the culprit who fled.

111
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:30,881
Who do you think was the winner back then?

112
00:10:32,924 --> 00:10:35,302
Wait, are you saying…

113
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:53,403
EPISODE 7

114
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:56,490
LAW FIRM INVICTUS

115
00:10:58,658 --> 00:10:59,993
"Invictus"?

116
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,208
Okay, the operation will begin.

117
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,668
REPORT

118
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:11,421
So after your husband died,

119
00:11:11,505 --> 00:11:15,342
you're in conflict with his ex-wife's son
over the inheritance?

120
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:16,802
Yes.

121
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:20,472
The cause of death was a heart attack.

122
00:11:20,555 --> 00:11:22,099
It was a chronic disease.

123
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,683
A cloning disease?

124
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:27,104
Like cloning? Is that a real disease?

125
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:31,233
A chronic disease.

126
00:11:31,316 --> 00:11:34,027
It means he suffered for a long time.

127
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,905
Oh, of course!

128
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:38,615
That's right.

129
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:45,664
And his ex-wife's son suspects
you're connected to your husband's death?

130
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:46,790
Right?

131
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:48,625
Isn't that ridiculous?

132
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:49,709
Look at this.

133
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,463
He was 88.

134
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:55,382
He was going to die on his own.

135
00:11:55,465 --> 00:11:58,552
Why would I bother to create a situation
to make everyone suspect me?

136
00:11:58,635 --> 00:12:01,805
I may be stupid, but I know that much.

137
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:04,266
I've seen it on TV.

138
00:12:04,349 --> 00:12:08,103
Coincidentally, it happened two days
after you registered your marriage.

139
00:12:14,526 --> 00:12:15,652
Attorney Bae.

140
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:19,906
You don't think...

141
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:24,035
I killed my husband too, do you?

142
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:28,748
Ma'am.

143
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:33,587
Whether you killed your husband or not,

144
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,422
that is none of my concern.

145
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:37,174
What the hell are you saying?

146
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:38,675
I'm saying

147
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:43,263
my role is to just help you, my client,

148
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:46,266
receive a lot of inheritance.

149
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:52,814
I misunderstood. So that's what you meant!

150
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:54,649
Oh, honey. I mean, Attorney Bae.

151
00:12:54,733 --> 00:12:57,444
You're amazing! Absolutely awesome.

152
00:12:59,362 --> 00:13:00,447
Also,

153
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:05,702
this is the will my husband wrote
before he died.

154
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,579
Could you take a look at it?

155
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,414
Do you think

156
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:11,833
I'll be able to get all of his fortune?

157
00:13:12,459 --> 00:13:16,004
Well, the issue is

158
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:19,674
your husband was on medication
for dementia.

159
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,010
Why would that be a problem?

160
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:25,680
If there's a record of dementia
at the time the will was written,

161
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:28,558
his son will likely file a suit
to have it nullified.

162
00:13:28,642 --> 00:13:33,647
Then, the will
won't likely hold any power.

163
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:34,814
Damn it.

164
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,775
So I won't get anything?

165
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,152
This is ridiculous!

166
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:41,029
Calm down, ma'am.

167
00:13:41,112 --> 00:13:42,322
I think

168
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:47,869
I can come up with a different plan
that's safer than this.

169
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:51,998
What do you mean by something safer?

170
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:53,208
We'll first frame the son

171
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:56,419
as a bad son or a big scoundrel…

172
00:13:56,503 --> 00:13:59,381
But my stepson isn't that bad.

173
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:00,465
Right.

174
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,968
We'll take advantage of the forced share

175
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:06,763
and include the inheritance
he passed to his son before his death.

176
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,391
Then, we'll demand the loss
of the son's forced share.

177
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:13,603
If we demand at least 1.5 to 1--

178
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,523
At least 1.5 to 1. I like that.

179
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,067
Attorney Bae, you're amazing.

180
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,819
You're so smart, honey.

181
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,154
Let's go with 1.5 to 1.

182
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,787
Anyway, I feel relieved thanks to you.

183
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:33,665
I'll come up with a good strategy

184
00:14:33,748 --> 00:14:35,959
to make his son give up the lawsuit.

185
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:39,087
I have such good luck.

186
00:14:40,964 --> 00:14:42,966
I'm so happy to have met you.

187
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,635
Okay, but if you could let go…

188
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:47,137
It's because I'm so happy.

189
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,472
-Right.
-I'm so glad I met you!

190
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:50,473
Mom!

191
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,313
Son.

192
00:14:56,855 --> 00:14:57,939
Son?

193
00:14:58,023 --> 00:14:59,899
What are you doing here?

194
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,109
Mom.

195
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:09,993
Dad just died,
and you're already with another man?

196
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,078
In broad daylight?

197
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:16,708
Mom, how could you do this?

198
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:20,295
Son, this is not what you think it is.

199
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:21,921
Don't you lie to me!

200
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,090
I saw it with my own eyes!

201
00:15:24,174 --> 00:15:26,301
Sir, you're very mistaken…

202
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,470
I mean, this is a misunderstanding.

203
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,182
Oh my!

204
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,517
So you've been having a fling
with my stepmom?

205
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,311
Since when? Tell me!

206
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:37,687
What are you talking about?

207
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:38,813
Please let go.

208
00:15:38,897 --> 00:15:41,399
-Let's talk it--
-Yeah, let him go and let's talk!

209
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:43,860
Was it your idea to seduce my dad,
register the marriage,

210
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,528
and write the will?

211
00:15:45,612 --> 00:15:46,446
What?

212
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:49,032
Are you the one controlling my stepmom?

213
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:50,950
What? Why would I do that?

214
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:56,164
Hey, you dirtbag!

215
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:59,918
Son! How dare you act so rudely
in front of your mother?

216
00:16:00,001 --> 00:16:01,127
Let go of him now!

217
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:03,505
Did you just take this bastard's side?

218
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,090
What is wrong with you?

219
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:07,425
Son, do you still not know my type?

220
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,594
I don't like old men
with side parts like this!

221
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,805
I like K-pop idols!

222
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,323
Son!

223
00:16:34,244 --> 00:16:38,039
Son! Hey, someone call an ambulance!

224
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:40,875
Don't just stand there and watch!
Call an ambulance!

225
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,087
Son!

226
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,798
Geez, I said no pictures.

227
00:16:46,881 --> 00:16:49,008
Hey, kid. Stop them, will you?

228
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:49,926
Hey.

229
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,888
Stop them, you idiots.

230
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:57,600
-Sir.
-Yes?

231
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,269
Did you collect all the samples here?

232
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:01,312
Yes, we're almost done.

233
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,731
-Sir.
-Yeah?

234
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:08,027
Goodness, you're the famous lawyer
Bae Young-min. I'm a big fan.

235
00:17:08,486 --> 00:17:09,320
Hello.

236
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:11,322
How did you end up creating this mess?

237
00:17:11,406 --> 00:17:12,240
What?

238
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,076
No, it wasn't me.
He grabbed me by the collar first.

239
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,579
Whether he grabbed you by the collar
or you grabbed him,

240
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:20,081
that's not what matters, man.

241
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:23,168
The victim is on the verge
of death right now.

242
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,627
What are you talking about?

243
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:26,796
-Hey. You didn't report this yet, right?
-No, sir.

244
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:30,049
Geez.

245
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,135
My goodness.

246
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,512
So, should I report it, sir?

247
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:37,307
Gosh, I am your fan, but…

248
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:42,020
Look, how about this?

249
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,189
Before this gets any worse,

250
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,274
how about you settle with the victim…

251
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,942
Settle?

252
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,195
You don't want to?

253
00:17:50,278 --> 00:17:53,156
-Or we can talk about it at the station.
-Yeah, that's safer.

254
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,991
Wait, hold on.

255
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:56,910
I think just settling would be better.

256
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,286
-You're going to settle?
-Yes.

257
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,370
Okay.

258
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:02,582
I mean, we already have
the car ready though.

259
00:18:02,665 --> 00:18:03,917
-No, wait…
-Well,

260
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,337
this is why you shouldn't exploit
innocent people.

261
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:12,008
All the profit from this operation
will go to the produce store owner.

262
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,011
I can't believe he framed

263
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,680
a victim of a fire for arson
and pocketed the legal fees.

264
00:18:19,224 --> 00:18:21,976
Call him in about two hours
and wrap it up, James.

265
00:18:34,697 --> 00:18:37,075
This is the hottest case right now.

266
00:18:39,953 --> 00:18:42,038
I can already smell the stench.

267
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,626
MYSTIQUE CEO
COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGES

268
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:57,846
I think we have our next load of laundry.

269
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:07,105
Your Honor,

270
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,399
as you can see
in the submitted medical record,

271
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,526
the defendant Lee Hye-yun's skin problems

272
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:14,988
were caused by her irregular lifestyle
and sick building syndrome,

273
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,991
and her preexisting case
of eczema recurred.

274
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:24,205
Experts unanimously agree this has
no connection to Mystique's cosmetics.

275
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:27,917
Despite this, the defendant produced
and distributed a malicious video,

276
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:33,006
claiming that all these symptoms
were caused by Mystique's products.

277
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:36,593
By filing a lawsuit, she inflicted
significant damage to the company.

278
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:39,679
Mom, I don't see Bae Young-min,
the guy you had a fling with.

279
00:19:39,762 --> 00:19:42,599
Rumors spread
about his affair with a client

280
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,933
and attempted murder charges.

281
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:45,894
He won't be able to show his face
for a while.

282
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:47,896
WITNESS

283
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:50,607
Ms. Lee Ye-sol, you recently met
with Lee Hye-yun, correct?

284
00:19:51,316 --> 00:19:52,150
Yes.

285
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,694
We met and shared a meal once.

286
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:57,989
What did the defendant say when you met?

287
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:04,996
She told me to keep my mouth shut.

288
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:07,165
But it had been a while…

289
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:10,126
Gil Beauty produced a fake witness again?

290
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,003
It's because of what happened
five years ago.

291
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:12,921
Back then,

292
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:15,340
she suggested we commit fraud.

293
00:20:16,716 --> 00:20:17,550
What?

294
00:20:18,009 --> 00:20:20,553
She showed me the pimples on her face

295
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:23,139
and said she came up
with an awesome, life-changing idea.

296
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,851
Then, she handed me a new Mystique product
that was popular at the time.

297
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:27,769
Hey.

298
00:20:27,852 --> 00:20:30,396
I liked it, so I bought that for you
with my own money.

299
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,815
I didn't suggest anything.
Don't be ridiculous.

300
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,318
Defendant, please remain silent.

301
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:36,819
Calm down.

302
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:39,238
Please continue.

303
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:42,700
What did she say to try and persuade you?

304
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:45,703
She said I'd at least
get enough for a building.

305
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:46,829
Hey!

306
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:49,999
When did I ever say that?
Do you have proof?

307
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,751
Yes, we do have evidence.

308
00:20:52,210 --> 00:20:54,379
Ms. Lee Ye-sol,
you may return to your seat.

309
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:58,967
We submit as evidence the messages
Lee Hye-yun shared with the witness.

310
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,845
Here are the deleted messages
recovered from the defendant's phone

311
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,305
through forensic analysis.

312
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,265
Could you display them, please?

313
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,270
TEXT MESSAGE ANALYSIS REPORT

314
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:13,523
I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU, SO BE QUIET
IT'LL BE OVER SOON

315
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,483
WE'LL EACH AT LEAST GET A BUILDING!

316
00:21:21,114 --> 00:21:23,324
No… That wasn't me.

317
00:21:23,408 --> 00:21:25,660
Seriously, I didn't send those messages!

318
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:32,625
We will now deliver the verdict.

319
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,211
For repeated production and distribution

320
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,257
of videos falsely accusing Mystique
on your personal Neotube channel

321
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,926
to receive large amounts of compensation,

322
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:46,055
and for greatly impacting
the company's reputation and sales,

323
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:49,183
the defendant, Lee Hye-yun,

324
00:21:49,267 --> 00:21:52,311
is sentenced to one year
and six months in prison

325
00:21:52,395 --> 00:21:55,148
and three years of probation.

326
00:21:56,566 --> 00:21:57,817
Prison?

327
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:00,987
You think I don't know
this is all a setup?

328
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:02,572
How much were you bribed for this?

329
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:04,782
Defendant, please be quiet.

330
00:22:04,866 --> 00:22:07,285
You will be dismissed
for insulting the court.

331
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:08,745
I was the one who was insulted.

332
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,039
Why won't you even listen to me?

333
00:22:11,122 --> 00:22:14,000
Don't touch me.
I'm going to sue all of you!

334
00:22:15,918 --> 00:22:17,879
Don't you see? I endured all this…

335
00:22:17,962 --> 00:22:22,050
Gil Beauty, no matter how much
you fabricate the evidence with money,

336
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:23,801
you can never fool me.

337
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:26,721
I'll head to Gil Beauty's car.

338
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,848
James and Gu-ho, proceed as we planned.

339
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:32,185
Let's do this.

340
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:35,396
She's coming out!

341
00:22:37,023 --> 00:22:41,152
Can you tell us how you feel
after winning this lengthy lawsuit?

342
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,321
Thanks to everyone

343
00:22:44,822 --> 00:22:46,908
who supported Mystique…

344
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:55,291
I was able to endure
thanks to all of their support.

345
00:22:58,628 --> 00:23:02,799
We at Mystique will devote ourselves
to doing things the right way.

346
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,967
We will make an effort

347
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:08,971
to become an honest
and healthy company that fulfills

348
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:11,140
its social responsibility.

349
00:23:12,266 --> 00:23:13,392
Thank you.

00:23:34,831 --> 00:23:35,873

Ma'am, are you okay?

354

Oh no.

355
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,773
-Ma'am, the tire--
-Wait!

356
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:05,069
Let me check.

357
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:07,822
Gosh.

Gosh, this…

00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,411
Did you make enemies or something?

360
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:16,122
My goodness.

361
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,749
This is…

362
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:23,379
This was stuck deep inside.

363
00:24:27,717 --> 00:24:29,051
What should we do, ma'am?

364
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,554
Well, what else?
You should call your insurance.

365
00:24:31,637 --> 00:24:34,432
My store doesn't deal with
luxury tires like these.

366
00:24:34,515 --> 00:24:37,226
Gosh, these tires are nice. My goodness.

367
00:24:38,686 --> 00:24:40,605
That discharger
is a super close range type.

368
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:42,064
You have to get very close.

369
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:44,901
Hello, is this the insurance company?

370
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,277
More. Get closer to her.

371
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,528
Get right up close.

372
00:24:47,612 --> 00:24:48,863
What's this? Hang on.

373
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,531
Yes, our license plate number is…

374
00:24:50,615 --> 00:24:51,699
-Yes.
-Your hair…

375
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,075
-Hold on.
-Our car's…

376
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,578
You lose a lot of hair
when the seasons change.

377
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,038
-Hello?
-Gosh, so much hair.

378
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,122
-Hello?
-How dreadful.

379
00:24:58,206 --> 00:24:59,498
Hello?

380
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:00,917
What the…

381
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,959
All right.

382
00:25:02,043 --> 00:25:03,419
What a chill guy.

383
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:04,837
Wait, why is this…

384
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:06,130
It turned off?

385
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:09,926
My phone's out of battery, ma'am.

386
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:11,344
Oh no.

387
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,596
Your phone died? What will you do now?

388
00:25:14,222 --> 00:25:15,056
Here.

389
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,731
What are you--

390
00:25:23,814 --> 00:25:24,941
So pretty…

391
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:29,654
Stupid mosquito!

392
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,281
I missed it.

393
00:25:32,365 --> 00:25:34,825
A mosquito in the middle of winter?

394
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:35,743
Gosh.

395
00:25:37,912 --> 00:25:38,955
Geez.

396
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,041
-Global warming is getting really serious.
-It's dead.

397
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:43,542
My goodness.

398
00:25:44,043 --> 00:25:44,919
What?

399
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,379
Yours is dead too.

400
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:49,340
Well, shall we go in first?

401
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:51,884
You can make a call inside.

402
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,803
Let's get inside for now, ma'am.

403
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,889
I'll serve you our signature coffee.
Come on.

404
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:01,519
Yes, Seonbi-ro 1104.

405
00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:04,981
-Yes, we got a flat tire.
-Here.

406
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:09,402
This is Owly Motors' signature coffee.

407
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:10,778
The old-fashioned way.

408
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:14,073
I'll help you charge your phone.

409
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:18,244
Yes, please hurry.

410
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,663
If you just plug it in,

411
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:24,083
all the data in Gil Beauty's phone
will be transferred to this server.

412
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:25,459
Okay, bye.

413
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:26,711
Secretary Choi?

414
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,133
This actually worked out.

415
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:33,301
It had been hectic.

416
00:26:33,384 --> 00:26:34,719
No, it hasn't been hectic.

417
00:26:34,802 --> 00:26:35,720
It's okay.

418
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:37,054
I'm okay too.

419
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:38,848
-It's okay…
-It's…

420
00:26:40,808 --> 00:26:41,642
It's okay.

421
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,646
She's strong.

422
00:26:48,232 --> 00:26:50,151
They will be here as soon as possible.

423
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:51,485
It's okay.

424
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:53,779
Forget about Gil Beauty's phone
and secure her secretary's.

425
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:09,253
This is great.

426
00:27:09,337 --> 00:27:10,421
What a chill guy.

427
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:15,051
Just as expected?

428
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,219
No, better than that.

429
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:20,681
She didn't seem like that at all though.

430
00:27:21,223 --> 00:27:23,642
You act stupid
whenever you see someone pretty.

431
00:27:23,726 --> 00:27:25,394
When did I ever act stupid?

432
00:27:25,478 --> 00:27:27,688
He wasn't acting stupid. He was dazed.

433
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,567
To be honest, I was kind of shocked.

434
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,444
Who would think she's James' age?

435
00:27:33,527 --> 00:27:34,737
-Is that how it is?
-Sorry.

436
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,654
Okay. Fine.

437
00:27:35,738 --> 00:27:37,073
-That's not what I meant.
-Okay.

438
00:27:37,156 --> 00:27:39,075
Who cares if you were stupid or dazed?

439
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:42,411
All those tears she shed
in front of court.

440
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,580
Those were...

441
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,582
crocodile tears.

442
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:49,960
They weren't tears one sheds
when they're sad or happy.

443
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:54,840
They were like a lubricant that comes out
when a predator chews its prey.

444
00:27:56,092 --> 00:27:56,967
Anyway,

445
00:27:57,635 --> 00:27:59,512
they were fake tears.

446
00:28:01,389 --> 00:28:04,350
Gil Beauty is
a Goguryeo Women's University graduate.

447
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:06,894
She became a celebrity
through a local beauty contest.

448
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,771
As she gained attention
starring in commercials,

449
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,272
she suddenly retired.

450
00:28:10,815 --> 00:28:13,234
She launched the cosmetics brand Mystique

451
00:28:13,317 --> 00:28:15,694
and expanded her business
at an intimidating pace.

452
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:19,156
As the founder of a company with nearly
500 billion won in annual sales,

453
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,700
she's a monumental figure
in the beauty industry.

454
00:28:22,576 --> 00:28:23,994
Ms. Gil has arrived.

455
00:28:26,497 --> 00:28:28,040
Ms. Gil is here!

456
00:28:30,543 --> 00:28:33,170
Ms. Gil!

457
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:50,438
Hello, ma'am.

458
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:52,523
This way.

459
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,296
BODY SCAN RESULT

460
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:26,098
Ten percent body fat.

461
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,767
I won't accept
anything more than twice that.

462
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:31,812
All employees must keep
their body fat percentage in the twenties.

463
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:33,481
Your appearance is also your talent.

464
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:44,700
Gil Beauty,
known as the "Korean goddess of beauty,"

465
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:48,954
is beloved by the public
for her calm, intellectual image

466
00:29:49,038 --> 00:29:51,457
and immaculate personal life.

467
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:55,544
However, the venom in her sharp tongue
is beyond your imagination.

468
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:59,715
The things she says to her employees
are mostly insulting criticisms.

469
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:03,302
To Gil Beauty,
beauty is the truth and justice.

470
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:05,137
What am I looking at right now?

471
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,224
You are the faces of Mystique.

472
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,642
Competence is a must,

473
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:11,977
and managing weight is essential.

474
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:13,270
Didn't I say that?

475
00:30:14,021 --> 00:30:15,231
I'm sorry, ma'am.

476
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,733
You need to answer my question properly.

477
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:21,195
I asked, "Didn't I say that?"

478
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:23,948
And "I'm sorry" isn't an answer to that.

479
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,533
Well…

480
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:28,244
You told me to lose weight.

481
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:32,498
A timid attitude like that
won't help you in life.

482
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:34,959
I will rectify it, ma'am.

483
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:37,920
Get on.

484
00:30:40,798 --> 00:30:41,882
Sorry?

485
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:45,135
But people are looking.

486
00:30:46,053 --> 00:30:47,388
That's embarrassing,

487
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:50,224
but not this?

488
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,727
I drank too much water earlier…

489
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:58,774
I was going to start on a diet today.

490
00:31:13,122 --> 00:31:14,582
BODY SCAN RESULT

491
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:17,543
Your body fat percentage. It's 32.57?

492
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:24,049
What a pig.

493
00:31:30,014 --> 00:31:31,015
From now on,

494
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:33,726
make it 15 percent!

495
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:36,103
What did I say?

496
00:31:36,186 --> 00:31:37,313
Fifteen percent!

497
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,065
You pigs.

498
00:31:43,485 --> 00:31:44,653
What? Pigs?

499
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:47,281
This lady is too harsh.

500
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,532
She's ruthless.

501
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:52,536
Gil Beauty is the queen of power trips
and the queen of lawsuits.

502
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,204
When you hear this, you'll get the idea.

503
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,916
Would you like to hear
about the slander lawsuit

504
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,128
or the compensation
for mental anguish one first, ma'am?

505
00:32:01,629 --> 00:32:04,506
Is that compensation suit
from the one who quit last time?

506
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,467
Yes, from the aesthetics department.

507
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,302
File a countersuit for a false accusation.

508
00:32:08,385 --> 00:32:10,220
Twenty-three employees have quit.

509
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:12,139
Three lawsuits are currently in progress.

510
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:13,932
Even if I lose the lawsuit,

511
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:17,811
the psychotherapy,
all different types of barbiturates,

512
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:21,482
and the horrible rumors
will ruin their lives.

513
00:32:21,565 --> 00:32:24,276
Insomnia caused by their anger
will torture them forever.

514
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,153
They won't be able to get
a decent job either.

515
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:29,782
So isn't it obvious
they'll either go crazy or go broke?

516
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,660
Well, it's even better if it's both.

517
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:34,495
Gosh, she's terrible.

518
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:38,040
She spent all that money
to stomp on the powerless.

519
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:39,500
Getting revenge is so easy.

520
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:43,504
With just a few pennies,
you can completely ruin a person's life.

521
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:47,675
We received apologies from those we sued
for leaving malicious comments.

522
00:32:47,758 --> 00:32:49,218
What should we do about them?

523
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:50,844
Stick to the original plan.

524
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,724
But there were a lot of comments
that were too mild to deserve punishment.

525
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,185
So, except for those people…

526
00:32:58,268 --> 00:32:59,436
Secretary Choi.

527
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:04,358
I heard well-trained dogs don't bite.

528
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:08,028
-Ma'am?
-What if we go easy on such comments

529
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:10,823
and create negative opinions
about Mystique?

530
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:12,950
Are you going to take
responsibility for that?

531
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,370
Ma'am,

532
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:18,288
I should've known better.

533
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:22,167
You have to be stricter on comments,
especially at an important time like this.

534
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:23,961
My apologies, ma'am.

535
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:26,755
Wait.

536
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,966
First, pigs. And now, dogs?

537
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:30,092
Sit.

538
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:31,301
Okay.

539
00:33:31,385 --> 00:33:33,679
Does she think
people are dogs and pigs or what?

540
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:34,596
Put it down.

541
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,808
Eat.

542
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:40,394
Good boy.

543
00:33:42,271 --> 00:33:43,105
Am I a dog?

544
00:33:43,188 --> 00:33:46,150
That's how Gil Beauty controls people.

545
00:33:47,067 --> 00:33:51,029
Today's trial went exactly
according to Gil Beauty's script as well.

546
00:33:51,572 --> 00:33:52,406
Her script?

547
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:55,451
Are you saying the Neotuber
who made that fuss in court

548
00:33:55,534 --> 00:33:57,536
was a victim and not a perpetrator?

549
00:33:58,078 --> 00:34:01,957
She is the true victim
of the halo effect and the horn effect.

550
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:08,338
Five years ago, Gil Beauty collaborated
with a few famous influencers

551
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:11,800
to promote her new skin care products.

552
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:16,472
Gudi, Gudi! Hi, subscribers!

553
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:18,223
It's the girl
who tries the makeup for you.

554
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:20,476
I'm cosmetics girl Lee Hye-yun!

555
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:21,685
Hi!

556
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:27,816
Everyone, I just got a facial
with Mystique's new line of products.

557
00:34:28,484 --> 00:34:30,194
Did I pay out of my own pocket?

558
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:31,487
Well, not this time.

559
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,407
Mystique reached out
and proposed a collaboration.

560
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,494
Isn't it crazy? You can tell, right?

561
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,121
I can't believe how my face is glowing.

562
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:44,666
No wonder people praise Mystique.

563
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,961
That influencer was thrilled
to collaborate with Mystique.

564
00:34:48,045 --> 00:34:50,172
But her dream moment didn't last long.

565
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:52,299
It was the start of her long suffering.

566
00:34:52,382 --> 00:34:54,176
My skin broke out,

567
00:34:54,676 --> 00:34:56,178
so I'm wearing sunglasses today.

568
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:57,805
I hope you understand…

569
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:02,851
It's because of
Mystique's new line of products?

570
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:04,228
I doubt it.

571
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:06,104
That doubt ruined her life.

572
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:09,024
Her face soon became
covered with blemishes.

573
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,692
She already had sensitive skin,

574
00:35:10,776 --> 00:35:14,947
and it became so flaky
she could no longer livestream.

575
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,240
Gosh, that's really bad.

576
00:35:16,323 --> 00:35:20,035
So, Lee Hye-yun filed a lawsuit
against Mystique.

577
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,956
But Gil Beauty switched idroxenon,
which can cause skin problems,

578
00:35:24,039 --> 00:35:27,042
to the eco-friendly
skin-whitening ingredient, sobinyu.

579
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:31,797
Then, she erased all traces of idroxenon,
as if it had been never used.

580
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,133
So basically, she switched
bad ingredients with good ones

581
00:35:35,217 --> 00:35:36,927
and manipulated her cosmetic products.

582
00:35:37,678 --> 00:35:39,096
Is that even possible?

583
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:42,766
You're seeing it right now.

584
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,978
As you know,
our country's still conservative.

585
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:49,481
So, an influencer with pink hair
and provocative clothes

586
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:51,775
wouldn't have been seen in a good light.

587
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:53,861
That gave the halo effect to Gil Beauty,

588
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:57,155
the successful businesswoman
who was beautiful to boot.

589
00:35:57,239 --> 00:36:00,659
Lee Hye-yun, who seemingly made money
the easy way with her pretty face,

590
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:02,870
got the horn effect.

591
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:06,790
The halo effect and the horn effect.

592
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:09,209
During the five-year lawsuit,

593
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:12,045
Lee Hye-yun tried to change
people's impressions of her…

594
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:13,046
She looks so cheap!

595
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,965
-She's so desperate.
-She makes me want to puke.

596
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:15,924
Go kill yourself.

597
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:20,095
It was too late to change
the already negative impression of her.

598
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:23,765
Lee Hye-yun ended up looking
like a money-grubbing streamer.

599
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:26,143
And Gil Beauty was praised

600
00:36:26,226 --> 00:36:28,478
as the goddess of beauty
fighting against injustice.

601
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:30,564
And yesterday,

602
00:36:30,647 --> 00:36:34,860
Gil Beauty submitted evidence
definitive enough to end the trial.

603
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:38,655
Wait, but if they did
a forensic analysis on the phone,

604
00:36:39,448 --> 00:36:41,658
it means that conversation was real.

605
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,870
In the era of AI,
evidence can easily be fabricated.

606
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:46,204
MANIPULATED EVIDENCE RECORDING

607
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:49,249
In the era of AI,
evidence can easily be fabricated.

608
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:53,420
This must end here and now.

609
00:36:53,503 --> 00:36:56,381
Ahead of this key contract,
I won't accept even the slightest flaw.

610
00:36:56,465 --> 00:36:58,425
Find someone
who's in urgent need of money.

611
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:03,931
ONE MONTH AGO

612
00:37:04,723 --> 00:37:06,642
Seriously,
Mystique's going to pay for this.

613
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:10,020
How's the trial going?

614
00:37:10,103 --> 00:37:11,980
Will you be okay
facing a major corporation?

615
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:15,067
I'll have to do everything I can.

616
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,068
Isn't that Lee Hye-yun?

617
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:18,987
The influencer suing Mystique?

618
00:37:20,906 --> 00:37:23,033
I heard her skin completely broke out.

619
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:24,743
I need to use the restroom.

620
00:37:37,547 --> 00:37:39,675
It'll be over soon,
so keep your mouth shut.

621
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:44,471
Hye-yun, don't you think
you should stop now?

622
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,767
I'll give you a nice cut, so be quiet.

623
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:51,144
It'll be enough
to at least buy a building.

624
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,024
DELETE

625
00:37:56,650 --> 00:38:00,320
Gil Beauty hired an influencer
who was a friend of Lee Hye-yun

626
00:38:00,404 --> 00:38:03,865
to fabricate the messages
and manipulate the forensic data.

627
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:07,703
Well done.

628
00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:09,746
Thank you.

629
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:13,792
Now that we've confirmed it,
let's move on to the next step.

630
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:18,005
Why are you looking at me?

631
00:38:18,088 --> 00:38:19,214
Is there something on my face?

632
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:20,716
You have a plan?

633
00:38:21,925 --> 00:38:22,884
What?

634
00:38:22,968 --> 00:38:23,802
Sit.

635
00:38:25,762 --> 00:38:26,596
I'm sure Yi-rang does.

636
00:38:28,015 --> 00:38:32,602
We need to know why Gil Beauty
had to manipulate the evidence

637
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:34,104
and rush to finish this lawsuit.

638
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:35,230
But how?

639
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,903
"One-day experience with Mystique
for invited beauty content creators."

640
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:44,156
We only have a few days left.

641
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:49,745
SSONY SYNDROME, RISABAEK, OFFICE WORKER G,
HYO-JIN CHO, LAMUTE, MASK GIRL

642
00:38:52,873 --> 00:38:54,750
My gosh, I was already imagining it.

643
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,835
Gu-ho does have a pretty face.

644
00:38:56,918 --> 00:38:58,211
Do I look good today?

645
00:38:58,295 --> 00:38:59,588
Yes, very pretty.

646
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:00,505
Thanks.

647
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:04,176
ONE-DAY EXPERIENCE WITH MYSTIQUE
FOR INVITED BEAUTY CONTENT CREATORS

648
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,306
Hello.

649
00:39:09,806 --> 00:39:12,976
We're honored to have here
beauty creators currently at the forefront

650
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,436
of the cosmetics industry.

651
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:16,646
I heard Mask Girl was coming too.
She's hot these days.

652
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:17,856
-Really?
-Yeah.

653
00:39:48,303 --> 00:39:49,387
Sorry, I'm late.

654
00:39:50,597 --> 00:39:51,640
I'm Mask Girl.

655
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,127
Are you sure about taking off your mask?

656
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,545
Of course.

657
00:40:21,628 --> 00:40:23,839
Mystique's skin care
is the best in the industry.

658
00:40:23,922 --> 00:40:25,006
I had to take it off anyway.

659
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:27,384
Besides, it would be so rude
to keep the mask on

660
00:40:27,467 --> 00:40:31,179
in front of so many famous influencers.

661
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:32,472
I have a cold.

662
00:40:32,556 --> 00:40:34,307
I'm so glad I came.

663
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:35,892
I can't believe I'm meeting Mask Girl.

664
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:37,102
You're so pretty.

665
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:38,395
Thank you.

666
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:42,566
Could you please stop drooling, Gu-ho?

667
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:45,819
That's not something I can control.

668
00:40:45,902 --> 00:40:47,946
Anyway, are you sure
nothing's going to happen?

669
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:48,864
Don't worry.

670
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:53,118
I already contacted the real Mask Girl
and said that the event was postponed.

671
00:40:53,201 --> 00:40:54,619
Get it together.

672
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:57,164
Don't get dazed again
and forget what to do.

673
00:40:57,247 --> 00:40:58,123
When did I ever forget…

674
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:06,548
All right, we will soon begin
our first program.

675
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:09,634
Shall we dig into
Mystique's secrets together?

676
00:41:09,718 --> 00:41:11,136
-Yes!
-Yes!

677
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:14,639
This is great.

678
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:24,441
If you've all changed,
we'll begin the yoga program.

679
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:25,984
Follow me.

680
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:39,372
This way, please.

681
00:41:40,415 --> 00:41:41,833
Yes, this way.

682
00:41:46,046 --> 00:41:47,339
This way, please.

683
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:51,468
Mask Girl! It's this way.

684
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,552
Okay. I'm coming.

685
00:41:53,303 --> 00:41:54,137
Please come in.

686
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,768
Let's go. Are you not feeling well?

687
00:41:59,851 --> 00:42:00,727
No.

688
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,145
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

689
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:05,065
This way. Quickly.

690
00:42:05,148 --> 00:42:06,483
It's starting soon.

691
00:42:06,816 --> 00:42:08,235
In the Downward Dog Pose,

692
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:12,239
raise your right leg toward the ceiling.

693
00:42:14,157 --> 00:42:16,576
Then, bring your knee close to your chest.

694
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:19,788
Go to a lunge between your hands.

695
00:42:20,622 --> 00:42:22,165
Raise both hands in the air.

696
00:42:22,249 --> 00:42:23,166
How do you do this?

697
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:24,376
Watch your voice.

698
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:26,211
Keep your tone high.

699
00:42:28,129 --> 00:42:29,047
Like this?

700
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:33,510
A woman's beauty
starts with a healthy body.

701
00:42:34,761 --> 00:42:37,722
Yes, you're all doing well.

702
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:05,083
What's going on? Was he caught?

703
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,344
Ignore the feeling!

704
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:18,722
What feeling?

705
00:43:19,931 --> 00:43:20,807
You don't want to know.

706
00:43:23,393 --> 00:43:24,644
Tighten your stomach.

707
00:43:28,064 --> 00:43:29,232
And all at once, up.

708
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:33,486
Yes.

709
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:34,487
Good job.

710
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,617
Everyone, don't let that fluster you.

711
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:42,078
Bend forward slowly and Uttanasana.

712
00:43:47,417 --> 00:43:49,711
How long are you planning to do that for?

713
00:43:54,341 --> 00:43:55,467
What am I supposed…

714
00:43:58,345 --> 00:43:59,304
What am I supposed to do?

715
00:43:59,387 --> 00:44:01,931
There are security guards everywhere,

716
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:04,184
and the staff follow me everywhere I go.

717
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:18,365
Should we take it to the next level?

718
00:44:18,448 --> 00:44:20,283
That's enough to kill him.

719
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,004
Next, you'll try the Mediterranean diet.

720
00:44:33,088 --> 00:44:34,547
Let's keep going forward.

721
00:44:34,631 --> 00:44:36,007
Wait. Let me use the restroom.

722
00:44:36,091 --> 00:44:36,925
Kim Sam-sik!

723
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,929
Excuse me. What's going on?

724
00:44:41,012 --> 00:44:44,474
That crazy woman… I mean, man…
I mean, patient escaped from our asylum.

725
00:44:46,643 --> 00:44:48,061
We ask for your cooperation.

726
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,188
Okay.

727
00:45:01,408 --> 00:45:02,242
Excuse me.

728
00:45:03,952 --> 00:45:05,078
Darling?

729
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:07,372
Darling, no!

730
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:11,000
What the…

731
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:14,754
Geez, what the…

732
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:18,299
Men in black!

733
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:33,064
Be quiet!

734
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:36,734
Geez.

735
00:45:37,152 --> 00:45:38,403
What on earth?

736
00:45:40,196 --> 00:45:43,199
I really had no idea
it was this hard to live as a woman.

737
00:45:43,283 --> 00:45:45,952
You were all dazed and happy
with those beautiful women.

738
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:47,162
And now, you're complaining?

739
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:48,955
It's really tiring. I'm serious.

740
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:50,874
It's a shame.

741
00:45:51,374 --> 00:45:52,208
What is?

742
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:53,710
What's a shame?

743
00:45:53,793 --> 00:45:56,504
You weren't planning
to use that for real, were you?

744
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:58,381
How about a light dab?

745
00:45:58,465 --> 00:46:00,884
No. Hey…

746
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:03,011
Look, it's on!

747
00:46:03,094 --> 00:46:07,015
What's wrong with all these participants?

748
00:46:08,892 --> 00:46:12,061
Don't you know it's important
to cast ordinary people for this program?

749
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:14,939
We'll keep searching
and send you a new list.

750
00:46:15,023 --> 00:46:17,358
Since this is the first live show
after the lawsuit,

751
00:46:17,442 --> 00:46:20,320
I told you numerous times
to put extra care into this!

752
00:46:20,987 --> 00:46:22,113
Yes, ma'am.

753
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:23,031
Next.

754
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,161
Are these the new samples?

755
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:29,287
Yes, ma'am.

756
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:41,633
But this is too much of a replica.

757
00:46:41,716 --> 00:46:45,553
Adding one herb to the original product
and disguising it with a new package

758
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:47,388
is not always going to work.

759
00:46:47,472 --> 00:46:49,265
The collaboration with Charpentier.

760
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:51,059
An investment of 300 billion won
in facilities!

761
00:46:51,142 --> 00:46:53,895
The contract will only happen
if they approve the samples we send.

762
00:46:53,978 --> 00:46:55,230
Don't you know that?

763
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,107
We've been pulling all-nighters
and doing our best to--

764
00:46:58,191 --> 00:47:00,693
What's the point of pulling all-nighters?

765
00:47:00,777 --> 00:47:03,029
The results are awful!

766
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:04,030
They're garbage!

767
00:47:05,573 --> 00:47:06,574
Get out.

768
00:47:07,575 --> 00:47:08,409
Go.

769
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:14,040
You too.

770
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:16,334
Yes, ma'am.

771
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:22,173
She's expecting
a major contract with Charpentier?

772
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:25,260
She had a reason
to end the lawsuit in a hurry.

773
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:28,054
Charpentier sounds familiar.

774
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:32,475
The top European cosmetics company
whose moisturizer costs 500,000 won.

775
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,396
One bottle of moisturizer
costs 500,000 won? That's ridiculous.

776
00:47:40,483 --> 00:47:42,277
Wait, Yi-rang got an idea. Right?

777
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,570
Yi-rang's got an idea.

778
00:47:44,028 --> 00:47:45,488
What does Mystique mean?

779
00:47:46,155 --> 00:47:46,990
Mysterious.

780
00:47:47,073 --> 00:47:48,449
Secretive.

781
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:50,827
That's why it's more attractive.

782
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:52,287
Right.

783
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:57,417
We'll lure in Gil Beauty in a way
that is mysterious, secretive,

784
00:47:57,500 --> 00:48:00,128
and thus more attractive.

785
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:05,258
The more she wriggles,
the deeper she'll sink

786
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:06,676
into the quicksand of ambition.

787
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:08,845
Once she falls in, she can never get out.

788
00:48:10,597 --> 00:48:12,265
THE OPERATION BEGINS

789
00:48:12,849 --> 00:48:15,018
Could you please read this?

790
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,437
I'm looking for my father.

791
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,813
Please take a look.

792
00:48:18,896 --> 00:48:21,107
Could you please look at this?

793
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:22,150
Could you…

794
00:48:23,484 --> 00:48:25,320
Please take a look at this.

795
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:26,988
MYSTIQUE BASIC SKIN CARE SAMPLES

796
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:31,200
I'm looking for my father.
Could you please read this?

797
00:48:31,284 --> 00:48:32,452
Thank you.

798
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:34,412
Wait.

799
00:48:34,871 --> 00:48:36,748
Okay, they fell for it.

800
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:39,125
Yes?

801
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:43,630
No.

802
00:48:44,464 --> 00:48:45,757
This isn't it.

803
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:50,386
Find someone who will look gorgeous
when we give her a makeover.

804
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:52,472
Someone who looks unstylish
but has nice skin.

805
00:48:52,555 --> 00:48:55,016
And someone thin,
so she'd look good when we dress her up.

806
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:58,102
Yes, ma'am. I'll send more people
to the train station.

807
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:03,191
Don't say you work at Mystique
for the time being.

808
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,485
Sorry? What do you mean, ma'am?

809
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:07,528
Look at your damn skin.

810
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:10,990
Take care of it, will you?

811
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:13,826
I didn't have time for it.

812
00:49:13,910 --> 00:49:15,161
What a sorry excuse.

813
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:22,919
I just got a photo from the train station.

814
00:49:25,546 --> 00:49:26,673
How about this woman?

815
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:43,731
Today, we're going to transform
Ms. Y from Gangwon Province.

816
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:46,984
There.

817
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:48,277
It'll feel cold.

818
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:55,576
First, clean your skin
with a toner from Mystique.

819
00:49:57,328 --> 00:49:58,246
Okay.

820
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:00,832
Her skin is very nice.

821
00:50:02,458 --> 00:50:03,418
What do you think?

822
00:50:03,501 --> 00:50:09,215
Our skin care products are enough
to make your skin moist and glow.

823
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:11,342
This is what I meant

824
00:50:11,426 --> 00:50:14,721
when I said Mystique's strength
is in sticking to the basics.

825
00:50:14,804 --> 00:50:18,307
Now, I will begin applying the makeup.

826
00:50:18,391 --> 00:50:19,767
Let me turn you first.

827
00:50:34,657 --> 00:50:36,743
Here are the products I used today,

828
00:50:37,285 --> 00:50:39,495
from skin care to makeup.

829
00:50:39,579 --> 00:50:45,084
How did Mystique's Green Line of products
change Ms. Y from Gangwon Province?

830
00:50:45,585 --> 00:50:46,919
I can't wait to see.

831
00:50:47,003 --> 00:50:48,421
Shall we meet her now?

832
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:50,923
Please come out.

833
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,207
My goodness.

834
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:27,710
As they say,
"A woman's transformation isn't a crime."

835
00:51:27,794 --> 00:51:29,086
This is just perfect.

836
00:51:31,005 --> 00:51:32,590
How does it feel to have makeup on?

837
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:37,136
I've spent all my life in the countryside,
so I've never tried makeup on.

838
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,264
I guess that's why I feel
a little bewildered.

839
00:51:40,348 --> 00:51:43,935
I think I look pretty.

840
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,978
This is a perfect makeover.

841
00:51:46,062 --> 00:51:48,147
An unimaginable upgrade.

842
00:51:49,023 --> 00:51:51,025
With Mystique, it's possible.

843
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:54,862
Why don't you try the makeup you saw today

844
00:51:54,946 --> 00:51:59,075
to return to your twenties
and your most beautiful days?

845
00:52:01,244 --> 00:52:04,413
Just like our guest today.

846
00:52:26,269 --> 00:52:27,895
Do you not like your makeup?

847
00:52:27,979 --> 00:52:31,232
No, I love it.

848
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:34,569
I'd like to have this every day.
Maybe I shouldn't remove it.

849
00:52:36,112 --> 00:52:40,324
It kind of doesn't match
what I'm wearing right now.

850
00:52:40,867 --> 00:52:41,951
Secretary Choi.

851
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:42,994
Yes, ma'am?

852
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:47,415
Bring the gifts from each Mystique line
and all the outfits she tried on.

853
00:52:47,957 --> 00:52:48,958
Yes, ma'am.

854
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:52,795
Gosh, no!
The appearance fee is enough for me.

855
00:52:54,338 --> 00:52:57,008
She probably doesn't go
to a dermatologist.

856
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:59,385
But her skin is so nice.

857
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:03,556
Gosh, my face feels a bit dry.

858
00:53:16,819 --> 00:53:19,530
Which skin care products do you use?

859
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:22,074
It's nothing special.

860
00:53:22,158 --> 00:53:25,369
I just use anything I can get my hands on.

861
00:53:25,453 --> 00:53:27,663
-Here you are.
-Right. Thank you.

862
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:31,542
Thank you so much.

863
00:53:46,057 --> 00:53:46,891
Here you are.

864
00:53:49,185 --> 00:53:50,937
"Beautifying Toner."

865
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,438
Beautifying Toner?

866
00:53:58,444 --> 00:53:59,278
Ms. Gil.

867
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:01,614
Good job yesterday.

868
00:54:01,697 --> 00:54:03,157
Thank you, ma'am.

869
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:10,414
You should've gone
to a dermatologist sooner.

870
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:15,419
Well, I had to clean up,
so I didn't have a chance to go yesterday.

871
00:54:15,503 --> 00:54:17,505
But yesterday, Choi Eun-seol…

872
00:54:17,838 --> 00:54:19,215
Good night, Ms. Oh.

873
00:54:19,298 --> 00:54:20,132
Good work, everyone.

874
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:22,134
Eun-seol.

875
00:54:22,218 --> 00:54:23,886
Could you tell me
your bank account number?

876
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:25,054
-Sure.
-Here.

877
00:54:29,642 --> 00:54:31,519
That must be pretty bothersome.

878
00:54:31,602 --> 00:54:32,937
Right. Yes.

879
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,314
Thank you.

880
00:54:35,398 --> 00:54:36,691
One second.

881
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:49,245
This will help a bit.

882
00:54:49,328 --> 00:54:50,663
Goodbye.

883
00:54:50,746 --> 00:54:51,914
Thank you.

884
00:54:59,088 --> 00:55:01,215
Her skin improved just overnight?

885
00:55:02,508 --> 00:55:03,592
Is that possible?

886
00:55:11,308 --> 00:55:13,394
I've never smelled
anything like this before.

887
00:55:20,401 --> 00:55:21,944
Nice texture.

888
00:55:22,028 --> 00:55:23,446
And it's easily absorbed.

889
00:55:24,447 --> 00:55:25,281
What is this?

890
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:27,658
Which skin care products do you use?

891
00:55:28,534 --> 00:55:30,119
It's nothing special.

892
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:33,247
I just use anything I can get my hands on.

893
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:34,665
Could this be…

894
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:37,918
the secret to that girl's skin?

895
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:42,089
Secretary Choi!

896
00:55:43,591 --> 00:55:44,425
Yes, ma'am.

897
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:48,429
That woman…

898
00:55:48,888 --> 00:55:52,058
No, check the ingredients in this.

899
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:54,852
Yes, ma'am. I understand.

900
00:55:59,899 --> 00:56:01,942
This product is definitely
not sold on the market.

901
00:56:02,026 --> 00:56:04,737
I also checked for its patent,
but it wasn't registered either.

902
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,739
That means it's handmade.

903
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:09,283
Are you sure
what I'm seeing right now is true?

904
00:56:10,034 --> 00:56:12,536
Yes, ma'am.
There are no chemical ingredients at all.

905
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:14,538
With natural sparkling water as its base,

906
00:56:14,622 --> 00:56:17,208
it's full of minerals
that are good for the skin.

907
00:56:17,291 --> 00:56:19,543
And the natural preservatives
from these wild mountain herbs

908
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:21,045
reduce skin irritation.

909
00:56:22,505 --> 00:56:25,508
Team Manager Oh's pimples
disappeared overnight after applying this.

910
00:56:25,591 --> 00:56:27,802
It was probably
due to the spadeleaf extract.

911
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:30,262
What you'll like about it

912
00:56:30,346 --> 00:56:34,600
is the added magnolia oil that gives it
a luxurious, long-lasting aroma.

913
00:56:35,851 --> 00:56:38,312
I think I also smell something else.

914
00:56:39,438 --> 00:56:42,108
And the possibility of using it
to collaborate with Charpentier?

915
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:45,236
Compared to all the products
we developed and sent to Charpentier,

916
00:56:45,319 --> 00:56:47,446
it excels in terms of ingredients.

917
00:56:48,656 --> 00:56:50,241
-Really?
-Yes.

918
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:54,370
Then, what's the phone number
of that girl from yesterday?

919
00:56:55,830 --> 00:56:59,125
I already checked,
but she didn't leave a number.

920
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:02,670
And all we know about her address is
"Manbaeksan Mountain, Gangwon Province."

921
00:57:03,212 --> 00:57:04,713
But can we find her with that?

922
00:57:04,797 --> 00:57:06,882
I'll send someone
to the train station first.

923
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:13,139
Manbaeksan Mountain.

924
00:57:13,722 --> 00:57:17,810
Manbaeksan Mountain. Beautifying Toner.

925
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:19,353
BEAUTIFYING TONER

926
00:57:19,979 --> 00:57:20,813
What?

927
00:57:24,316 --> 00:57:25,359
MANBAEKSAN BEAUTIFYING TONER

928
00:57:26,152 --> 00:57:28,445
KOREA! JOURNEY TO FIND A LEGEND!

929
00:57:28,529 --> 00:57:31,157
What the heck? It's so tacky.

930
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:33,325
GOODNESS! A VILLAGE OF ANGELS
AT MANBAEKSAN MOUNTAIN?

931
00:57:33,409 --> 00:57:34,743
"A village of angels?"

932
00:57:41,709 --> 00:57:45,337
Where on earth is it? Damn it.

933
00:58:22,917 --> 00:58:24,418
Oh my gosh.

934
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:21,892
Have you heard of
Manbaeksan Mountain Beautifying Toner?

935
00:59:22,726 --> 00:59:26,563
My nephew probably knows.

936
00:59:27,022 --> 00:59:28,190
Eun-seol.

937
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:32,278
What? How come everyone here
has such nice skin?

938
00:59:33,070 --> 00:59:35,572
Is this all Beautifying Toner?

939
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:37,491
I knew it.

940
00:59:40,035 --> 00:59:42,246
Make it exactly the same as this.

941
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:45,541
Copying it wasn't enough,
and she's going to steal the patent too?

942
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:47,459
That wasn't part of the plan.

943
00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:49,461
-No!
-No!
