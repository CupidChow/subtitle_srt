1
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:06,776
Hi. My young master bastard.

2
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,081
Hey, film this.

3
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,460
Our young master.

4
00:01:25,961 --> 00:01:27,379
Are you happy?

5
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:30,466
-You are stupid.
-Yeah?

6
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:32,301
-You want to die?
-Die?

7
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:36,597
Wake up, young master.

8
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,725
-Hey.
-Hey. Let go.

9
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:44,814
I was a boxer. Bring it on.

10
00:01:44,897 --> 00:01:45,898
Bring it on.

11
00:01:51,403 --> 00:01:52,613
Happy?

12
00:02:07,253 --> 00:02:11,799
I don't care whether you spend this money
on gambling or on drugs.

13
00:02:11,882 --> 00:02:13,551
What I care about is

14
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:18,097
how you brought this money
into this country without any trouble.

15
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,808
This is my first time.
You have to trust me.

16
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:23,143
Are you trying
to slip out of this by yourself?

17
00:02:23,227 --> 00:02:25,437
I'm doing this because I'm a newbie.

18
00:02:25,521 --> 00:02:26,564
-I never--
-Sir.

19
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:28,566
I need you to take a look at this.

20
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,943
Here's the video
of Rising Airlines' love child.

21
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:33,737
Me? What about me? What?

22
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,032
RISING AIRLINES' LOVE CHILD

23
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:41,954
Check his left shoulder.

24
00:02:53,382 --> 00:02:54,592
A gun?

25
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:10,316
Who are you?

26
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,446
Hey, show me the video.

27
00:03:20,242 --> 00:03:22,202
If you're going to scam me,
at least do it right.

28
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:30,920
What?

29
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:34,340
It's on the other side! I swear!

30
00:03:34,423 --> 00:03:37,009
That's a mirror reflection!

31
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:44,141
For Christ's sake! I told you.
It's on the right shoulder.

32
00:03:56,695 --> 00:03:57,529
Jeez, a gun?

33
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,492
EPISODE 2

34
00:04:02,201 --> 00:04:04,244
Just sit tight and answer my calls.

35
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,748
I could have you locked up
for smuggling cash, overseas gambling,

36
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:08,666
and even drugs.

37
00:04:08,749 --> 00:04:12,461
Would you rather be locked up
in the Philippines or Korea?

38
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:19,551
See you in Seoul.

39
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,136
Yes, sir.

40
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,685
Okay! He took the bait.

41
00:04:27,768 --> 00:04:29,853
Jeon Tae-su's not easy as they said.

42
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,272
I swear I almost peed my pants.

43
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:34,817
If you'd listened to me
and just played the pilot,

44
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,235
that all could've been avoided.

45
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:37,152
-Right?
-What?

46
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:40,197
Good job.

47
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,158
Yi-rang, why did you take that?

48
00:04:43,242 --> 00:04:45,077
That's a stimulant!

49
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,495
Spit it out!

50
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,122
Spit it out already!

51
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:49,915
Spit it out, Yi-rang!

52
00:04:52,418 --> 00:04:55,671
Yi-rang!

53
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,384
Come on.
I'm not stupid enough to take that.

54
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,720
Seriously, you always crack me up.

55
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,097
-Jeez!
-Let's go.

56
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,265
Just get in the car.

57
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,475
-You're making the pain worse.
-Good job. Now, lean on me.

58
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,937
Check when he was in the Philippines
and his alibi at the casino and the club.

59
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:12,855
Yes, sir.

60
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:22,406
It's me.
I need you to look into something.

61
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:26,118
Closely mark him to see
if he's the love child of Rising Airlines.

62
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:28,620
If anything suspicious comes up,
report it immediately.

63
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:30,289
Yes, sir.

64
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:49,308
We're home.

65
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:50,642
Nangrang, be careful.

66
00:05:50,726 --> 00:05:52,728
Come on, Jeje. One, two.

67
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:54,521
Jeje, be careful. Slow down.

68
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:57,066
Oh, my babies. You're home.

69
00:05:58,442 --> 00:05:59,902
Goodness.

70
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,072
It's Mommy and Daddy.

71
00:06:05,074 --> 00:06:06,658
Say you're home.

72
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:10,079
My babies refuse to go outside

73
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:13,540
without you, Mr. Myung.

74
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,668
No need to call me Mr. Myung.

75
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,213
If you need me to walk them,
just give me a call.

76
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:20,255
Here.

77
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:21,548
Thank you for your work.

78
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:22,758
Thank you.

79
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:24,843
Oh, hold on.

80
00:06:24,927 --> 00:06:26,053
Thank you so much.

81
00:06:26,136 --> 00:06:28,222
Oh wow. Goodness. Thank you.

82
00:06:28,305 --> 00:06:29,807
-No problem.
-Thanks for your work.

83
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,266
Goodbye.

84
00:06:50,828 --> 00:06:52,412
It's a pleasure to see you here in Seoul.

85
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:56,208
Let's cut to the chase. Bring the package.

86
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,460
SAND FOUNDATION

87
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:01,922
Take it to the Philippines

88
00:07:02,005 --> 00:07:04,800
and hand it off to our guy
in the agreed spot.

89
00:07:04,883 --> 00:07:07,761
May I ask what's inside that…

90
00:07:10,097 --> 00:07:11,265
Sorry.

91
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:15,060
What do you think
matters the most in life?

92
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,479
Well, obviously, that's mon--

93
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:19,231
-It's trust.
-Trust.

94
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:22,484
Since I'm trusting you with the job,
there are rules you need to follow.

95
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:24,862
Don't open the package
under any circumstances.

96
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,738
And no matter what happens,

97
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,907
do not mention my name.

98
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,535
If you break these rules…

99
00:07:32,244 --> 00:07:33,370
If we do…

100
00:07:36,832 --> 00:07:39,835
Use your imagination.
What do you think would happen?

101
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:48,552
Are you sure we'll be okay?

102
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,888
We do have a plan in place, don't we?

103
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,557
Please tell me that we do.

104
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,600
Not telling you.

105
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:57,352
What? How can you be joking…

106
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,898
Hey!

107
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,484
If I ask you a question,
I expect an answer.

108
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:09,823
Oh, I'm sorry.

109
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,074
I'm sure you won't die.

110
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,953
So typical.
You always have everything your way.

111
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:17,664
Maybe you should try
using your brain like me.

112
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,334
How dare you stare at me
with those round eyes?

113
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,003
Do you want me to make them square?
Or perhaps a triangle shape?

114
00:08:23,086 --> 00:08:25,797
See! There it is! You keep talking back!

115
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,884
Do you really want to see me
lose my temper?

116
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,387
Having fun?

117
00:08:33,096 --> 00:08:35,265
Enjoy it while you can.

118
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,810
It's just an act. Let's go.

119
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:17,391
Come on. It's a great deal.

120
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:20,936
-Is it 300 per night?
-It's 800…

121
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,354
Please give us a discount.

122
00:09:22,437 --> 00:09:23,355
What are you staring at?

123
00:09:24,773 --> 00:09:26,275
Just thinking about the old days.

124
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:28,777
Back at Sunyuldo Island,
where we first met.

125
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,112
-Make it 700.
-It's 800.

126
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:31,113
The place is near.

127
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,115
-We don't have that much.
-Make it 700.

128
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:38,996
WELCOME
GU-HO'S INN

129
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,747
Did you make a reservation for tonight?

130
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:41,748
Yes, that's right.

131
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:42,916
I see. Hello.

132
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,269
So what do you say?

133
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:04,146
-Where is it anyway?
-Just around there.

134
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:06,523
Right. It does feel familiar.

135
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,527
Peaceful, simple, and quiet.

136
00:10:11,737 --> 00:10:13,280
You used to be just like him.

137
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,116
Yeah, I was just like him.

138
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,704
Although things have changed a lot,

139
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,874
maybe we can go back one day.

140
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:27,586
Are you sleeping?

141
00:10:29,838 --> 00:10:32,049
You're the one
who started this conversation.

142
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:08,585
What the heck?

143
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:25,519
Is he still knocked out?

144
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:31,650
I told you to go easy on the gas.
We don't have much time.

145
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,901
I'm sorry.

146
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:35,153
Where's the girl? Let's check on her.

147
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,206
What the heck?

148
00:12:35,172 --> 00:12:36,006
Damn.

149
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:53,398
Jeez! You scared me! Who are you?

150
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,901
Who do you think?
I'm the one who kidnapped you.

151
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:57,527
Kidnap?

152
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:59,571
-You know Jeon Tae-su, right?
-Yes.

153
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:00,489
I mean, no.

154
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:04,576
I used to work with him back in the day,
but there was a small misunderstanding.

155
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:09,372
So unfortunately,
he had my internal organs rearranged.

156
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:13,251
See, I'm not the kind of guy
who can sleep at night when I owe others.

157
00:13:13,335 --> 00:13:14,669
So I plan to pay him back.

158
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,549
Is this your bag?

159
00:13:23,178 --> 00:13:25,514
That man is still up to his old tricks.

160
00:13:26,014 --> 00:13:28,767
If you had shown up at the drop point
with this package,

161
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:33,063
you would've been picked up by the police
and thrown into some filthy cell for days.

162
00:13:33,146 --> 00:13:37,359
That's what he does to test your loyalty.
To see if you'll rat him out or not.

163
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,779
I don't know why that's in my bag.

164
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:44,783
I have nothing to do with any of this.
You have to believe me.

165
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:45,992
Look, lady.

166
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:47,994
Drop the lousy act.

167
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:51,915
I'm taking this
to the Narcotics Division in Korea,

168
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,793
and I'm going to need you to testify.

169
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:09,808
I have to get out of here.

170
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:12,227
Yi-rang, hang in there.

171
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:15,689
I'll go and get the cops myself.

172
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:17,941
Those scumbags.

173
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,094
Look at that.

174
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,561
How are you guys doing?

175
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,688
Don't come this way.

176
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,065
-No! Stop!
-What's this idiot doing?

177
00:15:01,943 --> 00:15:04,070
-Wait. Stay!
-You can't get out of here.

178
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:08,867
Gu-ho.

179
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,035
Oh, I know. I get it.

180
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:11,995
Chairman Jeon told you
to keep your mouth shut.

181
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,580
But guess what?

182
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,583
You know what happens
when you fail to carry out his order?

183
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:23,381
Is that so?

184
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,315
Oh, fuck. I…

185
00:15:40,982 --> 00:15:42,108
Horrible, right?

186
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:44,903
The young man you came with
tried something cute.

187
00:15:46,529 --> 00:15:47,697
Awful, right?

188
00:15:47,781 --> 00:15:51,826
Even if you two make it out of here,
the chairman's still going to kill you.

189
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,079
So? Feeling a bit more cooperative now?

190
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:58,249
Or do you want your friend
to wear mittens for the rest of his life?

191
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,929
Please have mercy.

192
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,181
-What?
-Not on me…

193
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:17,560
but my friend.

194
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,439
Make it his ring finger
instead of his middle finger.

195
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:24,901
At the very least,
allow him to make a living.

196
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:27,404
Please, I beg you.

197
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:43,837
The lady next door asked me

198
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,381
to chop your ring finger off
instead of your middle finger.

199
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:49,050
Why?

200
00:16:49,134 --> 00:16:50,593
I'm only going to take your pinky.

201
00:16:50,677 --> 00:16:53,138
You'll lose your wrist if you move.
Stay still.

202
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,349
Clench your teeth.
It's going to hurt a bit.

203
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:09,654
What was that?

204
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:11,656
I told you not to move.

205
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,699
Stay still.

206
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:15,160
I'll cut her finger instead.

207
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:16,619
No, wait!

208
00:17:16,703 --> 00:17:18,163
Hold on.

209
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,540
Wait. I'll do it.

210
00:17:21,082 --> 00:17:22,876
Keep your finger straight.

211
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:25,503
Put it here. I'll just cut up to here.

212
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:26,671
That's all I'll take.

213
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:27,881
Stay still.

214
00:17:56,284 --> 00:17:57,202
What now?

215
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:00,789
Good job.

216
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:23,895
My finger.

217
00:18:24,479 --> 00:18:25,688
I still have it.

218
00:18:26,189 --> 00:18:27,065
It's still there.

219
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:30,443
Are you okay?

220
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:32,779
Chairman Jeon?

221
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:42,413
Chairman Jeon.

222
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:04,936
You're really in the mood
for this right now?

223
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,605
Do you have any idea what I went through?

224
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:10,859
And you asked him to take my ring finger?
Are you kidding me?

225
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:16,865
Gu-ho, why do you always see
just one side of things?

226
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:18,658
I do see more than one side of things.

227
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,618
The man who kidnapped us.

228
00:19:20,702 --> 00:19:24,664
He said it with his own mouth
that he had gone through the same thing.

229
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:27,250
But he had all five fingers on his hand.

230
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,295
He was just bluffing
about chopping fingers off.

231
00:19:30,837 --> 00:19:32,171
It's all a set-up.

232
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:35,717
I bet you
Jeon Tae-su heard every word we said.

233
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,345
That man is still up to his old tricks.

234
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:46,436
Anyway, thanks to
your heartfelt performance today,

235
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,272
I'm pretty sure
Jeon Tae-su's fully convinced now.

236
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,399
Lucky day for us.

237
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,235
I'm being completely serious right now.

238
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,112
I think Jeon Tae-su is

239
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,740
way more caring than you are.

240
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,911
For one, he hugged me. Okay?

241
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:04,787
He comforted me. Right?

242
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:05,705
What else?

243
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,123
-Gu-ho.
-What?

244
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,042
Have you forgotten about James?

245
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,004
Are you a piece of trash?

246
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,343
Jeon Tae-su, that scum of the earth.

247
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:19,677
That's right.

248
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:29,854
When is Jeon Tae-su going to reach us?

249
00:20:31,314 --> 00:20:32,732
That scumbag.

250
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,860
Just wait until he calls me…

251
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,617
Salute. Thank you, sir.

252
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:54,504
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE
FINANCIAL INVESTIGATION

253
00:20:57,298 --> 00:21:00,218
SAND FOUNDATION FINANCIAL STATEMENT
NOTICE OF TAX AUDIT COMMENCEMENT

254
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,971
THIS IS TO NOTIFY YOU
THAT A TAX AUDIT WILL BE CONDUCTED

255
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:09,560
This much evidence could lead
to a search warrant within a month.

256
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:11,771
I need to push the timeline forward.

257
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:13,523
I will keep that in mind.

258
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,859
What do you want me to do about the two?
Should I keep digging?

259
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:28,037
No, there's no need for that.

260
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,294
How much is all this?

261
00:21:36,671 --> 00:21:37,672
It's 50 billion won.

262
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:41,634
Fifty billion won?

263
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,308
Everything needs to be moved to
my summer house in Manila by next Friday.

264
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:53,479
The amount is much larger
than we expected,

265
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:55,606
so our current methods won't--

266
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,358
Are you saying no?

267
00:21:58,192 --> 00:22:00,153
Sir, with that amount,

268
00:22:00,236 --> 00:22:03,448
isn't it better to open
a shell company in the Bahamas

269
00:22:03,531 --> 00:22:05,199
and send it to that location?

270
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:08,578
You think I didn't look into that?

271
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:09,954
I'm sure you did, sir.

272
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:13,958
Stop spinning that worthless brain
of yours and find a way.

273
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:15,918
That's why I kept you alive.

274
00:22:20,048 --> 00:22:22,175
Well, there is one way.

275
00:22:22,258 --> 00:22:24,927
Good. And that is?

276
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:27,805
To reduce the time it takes to board
during vacation season,

277
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:30,141
they opened a new lane
that allows passengers

278
00:22:30,224 --> 00:22:32,643
to skip taking out their laptops
from their luggage.

279
00:22:33,644 --> 00:22:34,979
We can fool the X-ray

280
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:37,899
by placing a shielding device
in our luggage.

281
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:47,241
This device will absorb radiation
and block X-rays,

282
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:49,535
which will allow it
to slip through security.

283
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:11,307
All right.

284
00:23:11,933 --> 00:23:13,017
Shall we get started?

285
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:16,187
Yes.

286
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:46,676
Gosh. What's wrong with this dog?

287
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:49,804
Go away.

288
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:53,349
Hey, get away from me. Come on.

289
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:54,684
-What--
-You need to come with us.

290
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:55,935
Where are you taking me?

291
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,813
Let go! Don't touch me!

292
00:23:58,896 --> 00:23:59,856
Stay still.

293
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:03,901
I'm sorry.

294
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,778
What happened?

295
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,947
Why was that dog all over that bag?

296
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:11,367
Due to recent issues with cash smuggling,

297
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,036
a cash-sniffing dog was deployed
as of yesterday.

298
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:16,831
I should've informed you
about this in advance. I'm sorry.

299
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,626
What are you going to do about the money?

300
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,921
Do you know how much was in there?
That was one billion won!

301
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,257
The love child is back.

302
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:27,675
Bring him to me.

303
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,930
Hey. Ouch. Hold on.

304
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:35,808
-Where's the bag?
-What?

305
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:38,686
Well, my father got me out…

306
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:41,355
I mean, he pulled some strings.

307
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:44,150
About the money,
that needs to be investigated…

308
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,618
If anything happens to my money,

309
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:56,329
I'll cut you open and sell
whatever's worth anything

310
00:24:57,079 --> 00:24:58,206
down to the bones.

311
00:24:58,289 --> 00:24:59,749
-What?
-Take them both.

312
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:07,673
Would you like a flyer?

313
00:25:15,223 --> 00:25:16,057
Darn it.

314
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:28,194
Sir, this is it.

315
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:35,076
All you need to do
is focus on your responsibilities.

316
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,247
Are you out of your mind?

317
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:40,373
Sir, think about it.

318
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:42,041
What does the Sand Foundation do?

319
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:46,379
Protect children, respond to disasters,
and fight poverty.

320
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,173
What are you trying to pull here?

321
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:50,716
Basically…

322
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,970
We promote
the Sand Foundation's spirit of giving

323
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:56,430
on a global scale
through a massive donation campaign.

324
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:58,975
Which means we charter a private flight

325
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:01,435
to send relief supplies overseas.

326
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:08,484
FILL A RELIEF BOX
SPREAD WARMTH ACROSS THE WORLD

327
00:26:10,194 --> 00:26:11,028
What are you saying?

328
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:14,282
We'll fill it with clothes, medicine,
and relief supplies.

329
00:26:14,365 --> 00:26:16,784
If we split the bags of cash
in those boxes,

330
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:18,869
no one will suspect anything?

331
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:23,833
Leave the chartered plane to me, sir.

332
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,335
You know, I have my ways, right?

333
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,514
Ms. Kim.

334
00:26:41,058 --> 00:26:42,476
That's impressive.

335
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:44,687
Good job.

336
00:26:51,152 --> 00:26:52,153
Jeez.

337
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:56,991
What was that for?

338
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:01,245
My blood sugar's dropping.

339
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:04,206
Jeon Tae-su sure is intense, right?

340
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:07,126
He said he'd sell whatever's worth
anything down to the bones. Jeez.

341
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,546
You did well out there, Gu-ho.
Eat as much as you want.

342
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:25,186
Hey!

343
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,938
This pungent and funky cheese scent.

344
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:31,525
There's no way a dog could resist that.

345
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:32,860
Your timing was impeccable.

346
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,737
-Go away. What--
-You need to come with us.

347
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,238
Are you serious?

348
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:40,409
Why did you go the hard way
and make things so complicated?

349
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:42,787
We could've just chartered a plane
from the start.

350
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,246
Here's the thing.

351
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,082
I had to show Jeon Tae-su that

352
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:49,543
moving the money using our current method
was not an option.

353
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:50,669
For that to happen,

354
00:27:50,753 --> 00:27:53,756
he had to witness you getting caught.

355
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:55,800
That's how it works.

356
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:58,886
Once suspicion fades,
it gives way to trust.

357
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:01,806
If we had brought up
the chartered plane from the start,

358
00:28:01,889 --> 00:28:04,225
he wouldn't have bought into the idea.

359
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,813
What? Did you fall for me again?

360
00:28:08,896 --> 00:28:10,064
Oh, come on.

361
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,192
Am I really that pretty? Jeez.

362
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:17,488
I have to admit, the shielding device
that bypasses security was quite clever.

363
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:19,240
Thanks.

364
00:28:24,078 --> 00:28:28,416
Seriously, who would've guessed
this was all staged and set up beforehand?

365
00:28:28,499 --> 00:28:29,834
That's how people are.

366
00:28:29,917 --> 00:28:32,670
They only believe
what they can see with their own eyes.

367
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:35,756
They have no clue
how tight aviation security is.

368
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:38,092
Gosh, Yi-rang.

369
00:28:39,343 --> 00:28:42,847
Seriously, how do you always
come up with these kinds of ideas?

370
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,432
You were born to do this.

371
00:28:45,015 --> 00:28:46,934
It'd be a shame
to let this talent go to waste.

372
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:48,018
Jeez.

373
00:28:48,102 --> 00:28:49,478
Now, Gu-ho.

374
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:50,938
What's next?

375
00:28:57,862 --> 00:29:00,406
I just received word
that he'll be arriving soon.

376
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:10,958
Long time no see.

377
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:12,376
Excuse me?

378
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,962
I was supposed to meet you
with the chairman,

379
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:17,214
but I've been too busy to reach out.

380
00:29:18,466 --> 00:29:21,135
So, how exactly do we know…

381
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,721
Don't be a stranger. Come on.

382
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:24,638
Card.

383
00:29:29,018 --> 00:29:31,020
Let's talk upstairs. Come on.

384
00:29:32,938 --> 00:29:34,440
-Okay.
-All right.

385
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,533
SAND FOUNDATION
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER GO HO-JIN

386
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:48,496
If things go according to plan,

387
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:52,041
the Sand Foundation
will fully back the fundings.

388
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:55,377
Oh, of course. It's for a good cause.

389
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,254
Naturally, we'll do everything
to support you.

390
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:59,173
If you need anything besides the flight--

391
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:00,424
One more thing.

392
00:30:02,384 --> 00:30:06,889
No one outside of these four walls
must know about our meeting today.

393
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,725
Don't even tell the chairman about this.

394
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,689
Since we're a charitable foundation,

395
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:19,151
there's been quite a lot of talk
about the source of the funds.

396
00:30:22,112 --> 00:30:24,031
I will keep that in mind, Director Go.

397
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:26,325
All right, then. I'll see you around.

398
00:30:26,408 --> 00:30:27,243
Yes, sir.

399
00:30:30,496 --> 00:30:31,330
Yes.

400
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:34,208
Oh, that's nice.

401
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,709
Okay. See you.

402
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:37,419
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

403
00:30:48,138 --> 00:30:50,808
Booked a chartered flight
with Jeon Tae-su's money.

404
00:31:07,575 --> 00:31:10,244
Let's go.

405
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,104
Yes.

406
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,067
The trucks are entering the premises.

407
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:42,985
Yes.

408
00:31:46,822 --> 00:31:48,073
They've all entered the premises.

409
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:59,293
All right. Let's get on the flight.

410
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,796
And now, our great journey begins.

411
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,257
-Sand Foundation, let's do this!
-Let's do this!

412
00:32:10,012 --> 00:32:13,641
-This is almost over.
-I'd like to thank the supporters…

413
00:32:13,724 --> 00:32:15,643
Anyway, why are the supplies not here yet?

414
00:32:15,726 --> 00:32:18,103
Just be patient.
Luck is always on my side.

415
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:20,230
Can you make a finger heart?

416
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:23,150
-Sand Foundation, let's do this!
-Let's do this!

417
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:26,904
Thank you. Okay.

418
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,114
-Sir.
-Yes.

419
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,200
Take a look at this.

420
00:32:32,534 --> 00:32:33,369
It's here.

421
00:32:34,578 --> 00:32:36,163
EMERGENCY RELIEF SUPPLIES

422
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,046
Wrap things up here.

423
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:45,214
Yes, sir.

424
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:49,927
We'll wrap up the interview here
due to the flight schedule.

425
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:50,844
Thank you.

426
00:32:52,721 --> 00:32:53,639
Sir.

427
00:32:58,477 --> 00:32:59,353
Let's get on the plane.

428
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:00,688
Yes, sir.

429
00:33:02,815 --> 00:33:06,235
We should enjoy the ending
of our project together.

430
00:33:20,165 --> 00:33:21,834
Something feels different,
don't you think?

431
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,545
Don't be distracted
and keep your head in the game.

432
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:25,963
But…

433
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,400
We pulled the money bags
from the cargo hold

434
00:33:46,483 --> 00:33:47,693
and had them brought up.

435
00:33:49,361 --> 00:33:50,195
Thanks.

436
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,531
I couldn't have done it without you two.

437
00:33:52,614 --> 00:33:53,657
Thank you, sir.

438
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:56,160
We can't take the credit.

439
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:58,162
You were the one who gave us a chance.

440
00:34:00,748 --> 00:34:01,874
I'll use the restroom.

441
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:02,875
Oh, the restroom.

442
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:04,543
Thanks.

443
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:11,550
EMERGENCY RELIEF SUPPLIES

444
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:12,926
Yi-rang.

445
00:34:14,303 --> 00:34:17,055
I was clear on the plan up until now,
but what do we do moving forward?

446
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,515
We'll figure it out as we go.

447
00:34:19,516 --> 00:34:20,809
What do you mean?

448
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,978
What's that supposed to mean?

449
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:25,689
Oh, the restroom is occupied.

450
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:27,191
What? What are you doing?

451
00:34:34,198 --> 00:34:35,449
What a shame.

452
00:34:35,532 --> 00:34:37,284
-What?
-It was almost perfect.

453
00:34:37,367 --> 00:34:39,578
Sir, why are you doing this?

454
00:34:42,539 --> 00:34:44,124
KOREAN TOURIST MURDERED IN THE PHILIPPINES

455
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:46,460
CONFIRMED AS THE LOVE CHILD
OF RISING AIRLINES CHAIRMAN

456
00:34:49,713 --> 00:34:51,465
How dare you try to steal my money?

457
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:56,220
Oh, dear. You poor things.

458
00:34:56,303 --> 00:34:58,347
How can you be this unlucky?

459
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:01,517
Or maybe,

460
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,268
I'm just that lucky?

461
00:35:03,352 --> 00:35:05,479
I can explain everything.

462
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:07,481
-Sure.
-Wait.

463
00:35:07,564 --> 00:35:09,483
-Hey, don't move.
-What are you doing?

464
00:35:09,566 --> 00:35:13,320
That reminds me.
No wonder you looked so familiar.

465
00:35:14,404 --> 00:35:16,740
But who cares about all of that now?

466
00:35:16,824 --> 00:35:18,450
It'll all be over soon.

467
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:19,368
Please, sir.

468
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:20,744
-Don't do this.
-Hey, don't move.

469
00:35:20,828 --> 00:35:23,664
Once you wake up,
this will all be behind you. Okay?

470
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:26,291
Your job and your life too.

471
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:27,709
Hold on.

472
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:34,132
-What was that?
-What's going on?

473
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:37,970
What just happened?

474
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:40,681
Sir, are you okay?

475
00:35:47,437 --> 00:35:48,981
We're experiencing turbulence.

476
00:35:49,064 --> 00:35:51,358
Please be seated
and fasten your seat belts.

477
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:53,819
Darn it.

478
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:05,956
What's happening?

479
00:36:06,623 --> 00:36:07,666
Hey, go to your seats.

480
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:20,387
What's happening?

481
00:36:38,906 --> 00:36:39,907
Darn it!

482
00:36:51,293 --> 00:36:52,210
Hey, wake up.

483
00:36:52,294 --> 00:36:53,921
Wake up, for goodness' sake!

484
00:37:07,017 --> 00:37:09,394
Due to engine damage and the risk of fire,

485
00:37:09,478 --> 00:37:11,730
we are unable to continue
to our destination as we planned.

486
00:37:11,813 --> 00:37:14,024
We'll attempt an emergency landing
at the nearest airport.

487
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:15,692
-Sorry for the inconvenience--
-Shut it!

488
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:25,035
No!

489
00:37:34,836 --> 00:37:36,588
Watch out! Be careful!

490
00:37:43,387 --> 00:37:44,304
What is that?

491
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:47,599
Look.

492
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:52,062
Huh?

493
00:38:09,997 --> 00:38:13,291
In order to ensure a safe landing,
we need to lighten the aircraft.

494
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:15,585
We kindly ask for your cooperation.

495
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:17,504
Lighten the aircraft?

496
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,341
Hey, flight attendant.

497
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:23,552
Hey! What are you doing?

498
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:26,430
Sir! This is a dangerous situation,
so be quiet!

499
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:29,099
Hey, don't touch mine.
I said don't touch it.

500
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:31,768
Hey! I made it clear.

501
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:32,686
Hey!

502
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,355
Hey, man. Be quiet!

503
00:38:35,439 --> 00:38:37,190
She's only doing what's necessary.

504
00:38:40,610 --> 00:38:41,445
First Officer!

505
00:38:43,947 --> 00:38:46,450
Altitude loss! Cabin depressurization!

506
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,035
Yes, sir.

507
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,077
You…

508
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:51,496
Oh my. Sir…

509
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:53,248
-Don't.
-Let go of me.

510
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,291
Don't touch my stuff!

511
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:56,001
Emergency exit. One, two, three.

512
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:58,628
It's too dangerous. You can't do that.

513
00:38:58,712 --> 00:39:00,964
-Seriously. Don't do it!
-No!

514
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:07,012
Let go of me! No! Darn it!

515
00:39:13,268 --> 00:39:15,395
Release the heavy cargo!

516
00:39:16,646 --> 00:39:17,481
Release!

517
00:39:26,698 --> 00:39:28,408
Hey!

518
00:39:28,492 --> 00:39:30,243
What the heck are you doing now?

519
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:43,465
End of release!

520
00:39:46,343 --> 00:39:47,761
-Wait…
-No. Sir. Wait.

521
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:00,440
You dumped everything?

522
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:04,861
Thanks to everyone's cooperation,
we were able to react fast.

523
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:05,779
Thank you.

524
00:40:07,155 --> 00:40:08,073
You…

525
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:10,408
Hi. It's dangerous. Get back to your seat.

526
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:11,451
Captain Kim.

527
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:15,122
You punks. Are you out of your minds?

528
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:17,290
-Gu-ho.
-Yes?

529
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:18,792
-Gu-ho.
-Yes.

530
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:19,960
Yi-rang's calling you.

531
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:21,002
What?

532
00:40:21,086 --> 00:40:23,338
Wake up, boy. Get to work.

533
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,927
What's going on?

534
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,011
Are you out of your mind?

535
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:31,555
Let go of me!

536
00:40:31,638 --> 00:40:35,934
Did you just dump my 50 billion?

537
00:40:37,686 --> 00:40:39,437
Right! That was money!

538
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,399
What are you going to do?
I threw it all out.

539
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:44,192
What are we going to do?

540
00:40:58,957 --> 00:40:59,791
Open it.

541
00:41:00,542 --> 00:41:01,793
What?

542
00:41:01,877 --> 00:41:03,170
-Grab it.
-Grab it?

543
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,714
-Okay.
-Put it on.

544
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:08,884
Put it on!

545
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:12,012
Are you telling me to jump off this plane?

546
00:41:12,095 --> 00:41:13,555
-Of course!
-Okay!

547
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,849
Don't you dare move!

548
00:41:16,558 --> 00:41:18,226
Or I'm going to kill you both!

549
00:41:18,310 --> 00:41:19,895
Put this on!

550
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:21,897
What? Why do I…

551
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,023
Hey, you take it.

552
00:41:23,899 --> 00:41:25,400
Put it on. What are you doing?

553
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,485
Put it on and go find my money!

554
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:37,037
I saved your sorry lives when you were
barely making a living on the streets.

555
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,289
I gave you a shot at a decent life,

556
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:41,041
and this is how you repay me?

557
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:53,511
What are you going to do?

558
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:58,099
Are you going to jump off? Just for that?

559
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:02,187
"Just for that?"

560
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,734
You've never had this kind of money,

561
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,654
so of course you don't get it.

562
00:42:50,443 --> 00:42:51,736
-Did he jump?
-My gosh!

563
00:43:06,876 --> 00:43:07,752
Close the door.

564
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:09,713
-How do I close it?
-Grab that.

565
00:43:09,796 --> 00:43:11,631
Grab that.

566
00:43:11,715 --> 00:43:13,133
You got it.

567
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:15,552
You got it! Nice!

568
00:43:17,679 --> 00:43:19,014
One, two, three.

569
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:48,126
There it is.

570
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,170
There are my babies.

571
00:43:50,253 --> 00:43:52,255
Oh, my precious babies.

572
00:44:03,725 --> 00:44:04,726
My babies.

573
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,436
Thank you.

574
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:24,162
What is this?

575
00:44:27,874 --> 00:44:29,459
Darn it!

576
00:44:34,589 --> 00:44:37,092
The aircraft is now safe.

577
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:40,345
Ladies and gentlemen,
we'll take you safely to your destination.

578
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:53,817
James, while we're buying time outside,

579
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,236
swap the money bags
that are in the cargo hold.

580
00:44:57,070 --> 00:45:00,949
Do you know how hard it was
to switch all those money bags by myself?

581
00:45:06,663 --> 00:45:08,873
Good job. Well done.

582
00:45:08,957 --> 00:45:10,166
Nice acting.

583
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,626
Well done.

584
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:15,922
Yi-rang, good work. Well done.

585
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,133
Gu-ho, good job.

586
00:45:19,843 --> 00:45:20,802
James…

587
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:21,928
Oh no.

588
00:45:22,011 --> 00:45:25,223
What is wrong with him?
He's sleeping all day.

589
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:27,434
That punk. He's so fragile.

590
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:51,458
Ta-da!

591
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:55,920
Remember how I bought a winery
in Burgundy, France, last month?

592
00:45:56,004 --> 00:45:56,838
Yes.

593
00:45:56,921 --> 00:45:59,048
This champagne is from that winery.

594
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:01,634
Since I'm the owner,
I should have a taste.

595
00:46:01,718 --> 00:46:03,219
Of course you should.

596
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,017
How could you do that to me?

597
00:46:11,686 --> 00:46:14,189
Sorry. Just come and join us.

598
00:46:14,272 --> 00:46:15,690
-No.
-Just come here.

599
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,150
-No.
-Come here!

600
00:46:17,901 --> 00:46:18,943
I just don't get it.

601
00:46:19,027 --> 00:46:20,069
Explain it to me.

602
00:46:20,153 --> 00:46:23,198
How much of it was real
and how much of it was fake?

603
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:27,994
It's true that James approached him
disguised as a captain.

604
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:31,331
If you don't mind,
can I get your business card too?

605
00:46:31,706 --> 00:46:34,125
Jeon Tae-su was
way more skeptical than expected.

606
00:46:34,209 --> 00:46:36,503
It was hard to buy his trust.

607
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:39,172
So we realized
it wouldn't work out and withdrew.

608
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:41,382
TRUTH

609
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:43,426
From then on, it was a lie.

610
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:48,014
Jeon Tae-su never showed up
at the cargo ship that day.

611
00:46:48,515 --> 00:46:52,352
So James getting assaulted and beaten up
was a lie we made up.

612
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:53,269
FALSE

613
00:46:54,229 --> 00:46:57,649
We kept waiting for Jeon Tae-su
to call us after that,

614
00:46:58,274 --> 00:47:01,361
but because he was so skeptical,
he never even texted us.

615
00:47:03,655 --> 00:47:05,240
Change of plan.

616
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,034
But as soon as we withdrew the operation,

617
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:09,911
you came to our minds.

618
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:13,081
Because what Jeon Tae-su wants
is not trust

619
00:47:13,164 --> 00:47:16,459
but absolute loyalty and obedience.

620
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,503
So that was the plan.

621
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:21,881
You really had this all figured out
from the start!

622
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:23,633
Gu-ho, pass me the truffle oil over there.

623
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,386
Could you grind
some Himalayan pink salt for me?

624
00:47:26,469 --> 00:47:29,222
Seriously, my life is just…

625
00:47:29,305 --> 00:47:30,515
It's got a great body.

626
00:47:30,598 --> 00:47:31,432
So refreshing.

627
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,017
Seriously.

628
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:37,480
See? Absolute loyalty and obedience.

629
00:47:37,564 --> 00:47:40,066
That's what you embody.
You were perfect for this job.

630
00:47:42,402 --> 00:47:44,487
You can't have this. Don't eat it.

631
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,365
We're saying you're considerate.

632
00:47:48,950 --> 00:47:49,909
-Is that so?
-Yes.

633
00:47:53,997 --> 00:47:55,039
-Eat.
-Thank you.

634
00:47:55,582 --> 00:47:58,167
Wait, you were going
to jump off the plane.

635
00:47:58,251 --> 00:47:59,335
What was that about?

636
00:47:59,419 --> 00:48:02,714
Yi-rang, I'd always known
that you were crazy, but I never--

637
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,425
At altitudes below 3,000 meters,

638
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:08,386
the pressure difference between
the cabin and the outside isn't severe,

639
00:48:08,469 --> 00:48:10,722
so there's no risk
of sudden decompression.

640
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:13,433
FLIGHT ALTITUDE = 1,000 METERS

641
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:15,435
So as long as
we didn't climb any higher...

642
00:48:17,437 --> 00:48:19,314
I had already run the numbers.

643
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,568
Hey, still, that was wrong. You know?

644
00:48:23,651 --> 00:48:24,777
I'm serious.

645
00:48:25,486 --> 00:48:27,113
James, it must've been so easy for you.

646
00:48:27,196 --> 00:48:28,031
What?

647
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:30,158
When I was fighting for my life,

648
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:34,370
you were just lying on the hospital bed
all comfortable, just killing time.

649
00:48:34,454 --> 00:48:36,956
What are you talking about?
I was really busy.

650
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,875
I was always by your side.

651
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,044
What are you talking about?

652
00:48:44,005 --> 00:48:46,549
This isn't an art piece,
so just take the pictures.

653
00:48:46,633 --> 00:48:48,009
You're not filming a movie.

654
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:50,428
He left.

655
00:48:51,888 --> 00:48:52,847
-Did he leave?
-Yes.

656
00:48:58,311 --> 00:48:59,687
Salute. Thank you, sir.

657
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:01,606
Okay, bye.

658
00:49:14,369 --> 00:49:15,453
Gosh.

659
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:19,666
Why did they have to make it so tight?
I told them this wasn't necessary.

660
00:49:21,417 --> 00:49:22,794
I don't have time for this.

661
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:27,298
SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT PROSECUTOR GENERAL

662
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:29,092
I can't feel my arm.

663
00:49:29,926 --> 00:49:30,927
But I'm so busy.

664
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:35,723
Oh, be quiet.

665
00:49:46,651 --> 00:49:47,777
Where are you going?

666
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:50,780
I'm so sick of you.

667
00:49:50,863 --> 00:49:54,575
I've had enough. Don't try to find me!

668
00:49:54,659 --> 00:49:57,620
I think he's really sick of us this time.
I can feel it.

669
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,292
That hurts! Yi-rang. James.

670
00:50:03,376 --> 00:50:04,210
What's up, Ray-bang?

671
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:06,629
Help me. What's he doing?

672
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,632
You didn't have to bring anything.

673
00:50:10,258 --> 00:50:11,092
Salute.

674
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:12,260
Salute.

675
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:14,595
Hello. Good work, everyone.

676
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:15,763
Yes. Good work.

677
00:50:19,308 --> 00:50:20,810
You were from…

678
00:50:28,985 --> 00:50:30,653
When did this happen? Huh?

679
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:34,532
He's my junior from the Marine Corps.
He happened to be working for Jeon Tae-su.

680
00:50:34,615 --> 00:50:36,325
So I scouted him immediately.

681
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:39,704
Mr. Ray-Bang here brought Mr. Mustache,
who used to work in film,

682
00:50:39,787 --> 00:50:42,290
and that's how we got our secret agents.

683
00:50:42,957 --> 00:50:43,791
Okay.

684
00:50:43,875 --> 00:50:45,209
Well done.

685
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:46,878
Here, this is for you,

686
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:49,130
and this is for Mr. Mustache.

687
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:51,924
Thank you, sir.
I will continue to do my best.

688
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:53,593
Thank you. Have a seat.

689
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:56,471
This is yours, Gu-ho.

690
00:51:01,768 --> 00:51:03,102
What happened to the rest?

691
00:51:03,186 --> 00:51:05,021
Do you know
how much it costs to charter a plane?

692
00:51:05,104 --> 00:51:06,647
We also had to send the relief supplies.

693
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:08,232
Wait. Be quiet.

694
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:13,988
We recently reported that Nazareth,

695
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:16,324
a home that supports youth
in becoming independent,

696
00:51:16,407 --> 00:51:19,660
was at risk of being shut down
due to misunderstandings and rumors.

697
00:51:19,744 --> 00:51:22,997
However, two days ago, an anonymous donor
made a significant contribution,

698
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,042
and a new center is set to be built.

699
00:51:26,501 --> 00:51:28,085
A FEW DAYS AGO

700
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:32,715
LET THIS BE USED TO NURTURE THE FUTURE

701
00:51:38,930 --> 00:51:40,181
Sister.

702
00:51:41,057 --> 00:51:42,725
Sister!

703
00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:45,186
By the Lord's grace,

704
00:51:45,269 --> 00:51:48,689
an anonymous brother who shares our spirit

705
00:51:48,773 --> 00:51:51,067
has bestowed upon us a profound blessing.

706
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,652
So that's where it went?

707
00:51:53,861 --> 00:51:56,572
Give them this too. Give it to them.

708
00:51:56,656 --> 00:51:58,449
Whatever. You deserve to keep it.

709
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:00,201
We're not running a charity here.

710
00:52:00,284 --> 00:52:01,744
He's right. Gu-ho.

711
00:52:01,828 --> 00:52:04,205
Get yourself some snacks
with your little money.

712
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:05,873
Up next.

713
00:52:05,957 --> 00:52:08,584
Jeon Tae-su,
chairman of the Sand Foundation,

714
00:52:08,668 --> 00:52:11,963
is under arrest for child abuse
and aggravated unlawful confinement.

715
00:52:12,046 --> 00:52:12,880
Jeon Tae-su.

716
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:15,341
Police have discovered
that former Chairman Jeon

717
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:18,135
subjected children to prolonged abuse
and unlawful confinement

718
00:52:18,219 --> 00:52:19,554
within the welfare center he ran.

719
00:52:27,478 --> 00:52:28,938
They will conduct an investigation…

720
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:29,856
Yi-rang.

721
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:33,776
Why did you choose Jeon Tae-su
of all people?

722
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:36,988
He seemed different from
the usual dirty laundry we've handled.

723
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:41,868
She's sleeping.

724
00:52:45,621 --> 00:52:48,124
Well, that was fast. Let's go.

725
00:52:48,708 --> 00:52:49,625
-Okay.
-Follow me.

726
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:55,710
25 YEARS AGO

727
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:25,448
Too bad. I won again.

728
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:29,326
Since you lost, you need to get punished.

729
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:35,166
It's unfair.

730
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:37,168
What's unfair?

731
00:55:41,172 --> 00:55:44,258
Oh, are you saying you keep losing

732
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,010
because they scare you?

733
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:48,637
No. I'm just way younger than you.

734
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:50,598
But you're smarter than I am.

735
00:55:50,681 --> 00:55:53,142
What if I can't outthink
all that life experience you have?

736
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:54,852
And what if…

737
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:56,979
And I'm just throwing it out there.

738
00:55:57,980 --> 00:56:00,608
But you could be smarter than I am.

739
00:56:04,195 --> 00:56:05,446
That makes sense.

740
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:08,532
Fine. Then we'll play the game you want.

741
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:10,326
What do you want to play?

742
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:12,161
How about hide-and-seek?

743
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:14,789
Sure.

744
00:56:25,925 --> 00:56:26,926
Go.

745
00:56:30,596 --> 00:56:37,561
Hide tight, I can see your hair

746
00:56:38,437 --> 00:56:45,361
Hide tight, I can see your hair

747
00:56:45,528 --> 00:56:47,947
I mean, is this really necessary?

748
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:54,411
Hide tight, I can see your hair

749
00:56:55,037 --> 00:57:01,502
Hide tight, I can see your hair

750
00:57:01,585 --> 00:57:05,422
Hide tight, I can see your hair

751
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:16,433
Found you.

752
00:58:06,275 --> 00:58:11,447
ANY WORLD THEME PARK
KIDNAP CASE, MYUNG GU-HO, AGE 28

753
00:58:57,534 --> 00:59:00,037
An art critic well-versed
in all forms of artistic expression

754
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,164
and a major player
in the art business world.

755
00:59:02,248 --> 00:59:05,292
Then, today, will we get to see
an authentic masterpiece?

756
00:59:06,126 --> 00:59:08,337
All right. Let's find out who he is.

757
00:59:09,922 --> 00:59:11,632
Come to the gallery with the paintings.

758
00:59:12,132 --> 00:59:13,050
That crazy…

759
00:59:13,634 --> 00:59:15,010
He's a piece of trash

760
00:59:15,094 --> 00:59:17,221
who takes advantage of his status
to go after women.

761
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:20,849
James, wait. Did we get caught?

762
00:59:21,642 --> 00:59:24,603
I'm the Head of Purchasing
for Wonderby Asia. Olivia Kim.

763
00:59:25,104 --> 00:59:29,108
We'll dangle the bait using
Mr. Famous' most powerful memories.

764
00:59:29,191 --> 00:59:30,025
Jeez!

765
00:59:30,693 --> 00:59:31,902
What's wrong? What happened?

766
00:59:32,611 --> 00:59:35,364
May I ask when you arrived in Korea?

767
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:38,867
You must have met
Soul Auction's legal team manager.

768
00:59:39,535 --> 00:59:40,828
Don't worry.

769
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:45,791
What we need right now
is the perfect pushover.
