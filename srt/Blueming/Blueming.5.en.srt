1
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:07,700
What?

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:10,780
What was that?

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,950
Let's go.

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:14,740
Hey!

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:17,580
What was that?

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,040
What do you think about this place
for our assignment?

7
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,870
It's good, but tell me
what was that about.

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:26,580
It feels so nice to ride a bike.
It's been a long time.

9
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:30,320
Stop changing the subject.
What was that about?

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:43,120
It's so weird.

11
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:44,990
What is?

12
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:48,240
Why would you follow me here?

13
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,370
You know, the weather's so nice today.

14
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,080
Go now. I'm almost home.

15
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,039
Okay.

16
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,039
I'll go.

17
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:16,910
Bye.

18
00:01:22,539 --> 00:01:23,870
Take a good rest.

19
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,080
You do that too.

20
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,700
I'll get going then.

21
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:31,740
Bye.

22
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,039
It looks like he's Si-won's friend.

23
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,780
BLUEMING
COLORED BY YOU

24
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,539
It looks like you take a good care
of yourself, Da-woon.

25
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,120
It looks delicious.

26
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,910
Hey, coke makes you fat...

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,740
My goodness.

28
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:14,080
These two are completely opposite
although they're from the same mom.

29
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,740
I think they look alike. They're so cute.

30
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,700
What?

31
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,579
What? With this dude?

32
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,910
This dude?

33
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:24,079
Come on.

34
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,160
I try so hard to stay in shape.

35
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,320
Whatever.

36
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:30,410
I guess we look alike since we're related.

37
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:32,370
I look a little better though.

38
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,829
- My ass.
- My ass? Hey!

39
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,870
Knock it off.

40
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,120
My goodness.

41
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:44,870
This house looks so nice.

42
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,120
We won't live here for too long. It's just
that we're waiting for the redevelopment.

43
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,829
So it's a bit messy, but...

44
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,950
I think this place looks so nice.

45
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,490
It will look terrific if it's filmed.

46
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:01,040
- You think so?
- Yes.

47
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,280
I bet your parents find it hard too.

48
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:10,780
I can't believe it takes $3,000 to $4,000
for shooting a film.

49
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,280
And it's just an assignment.

50
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,450
I didn't say that.
I said $1,000 to $2,000.

51
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:17,079
And that's little?

52
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,450
You just asked for it out of the blue.

53
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:23,160
Do you take protein shake
by any chance, Da-woon?

54
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,450
Yes...

55
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,620
Dig in, mom.

56
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,040
I...

57
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,950
I don't think I should
stay here for a night.

58
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:49,040
I'll just go.

59
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,829
It's okay. Stay.

60
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,950
I don't think there even be
a bus since it's late.

61
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,160
Shall I stay?

62
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,740
Yes, stay.

63
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,320
Then I'll go ahead and wash up.

64
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:07,240
I'm not sure they'll fit, but try anyway.

65
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,990
And use this for your injury.

66
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,450
EP 05. BEFORE SUNSET

67
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:22,040
I can sleep on the floor.

68
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,620
It's okay. You can sleep there.

69
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,700
You seem busy.

70
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,240
Yun-jeong asked me something.

71
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,740
It must be nice to live
near to the college.

72
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,659
Yes, I feel that way too.

73
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,120
I've wanted to attend
this college as well.

74
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,280
You live close too, don't you?

75
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,200
I moved here recently.

76
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,120
My parents don't want to live in Seoul.

77
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,740
There were a few reasons I moved here.

78
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,580
I guess you figured it out.

79
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,620
The person we bumped
into earlier was my dad.

80
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,620
He has his reasons.

81
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,320
It's nothing important.

82
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,450
It's my birthday today.

83
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,870
Really?

84
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,120
Why didn't you say that sooner?

85
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,540
I didn't see anything
on the messenger either.

86
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,659
I wasn't going to tell anyone.

87
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,990
I just felt like I had to say something.

88
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,490
You're so weird.

89
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,780
Congratulations. Shall I
get you a birthday cake?

90
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,700
Do you mean that?

91
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,490
Thanks.

92
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,490
Sure. Do you think there's
any place that's open?

93
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,320
I'm sure there is.
Why don't you search it?

94
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,950
- I like strawberry cake.
- Strawberry cake...?

95
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,120
Hang on.

96
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,160
I'm just kidding.

97
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:12,620
Just kidding.

98
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:15,080
Where can you go at this time of the day?

99
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:20,830
It would have been nice to be
congratulated on the group chat.

100
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,780
I had a great day today.

101
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:29,450
Let's go to sleep.

102
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,080
Is there anything you want for your gift?

103
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,740
I'll say it then. Give me your word.

104
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,659
Okay. What is it?

105
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,200
Let me hang out in your place often.

106
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,490
My place?

107
00:06:46,909 --> 00:06:48,370
Can I not?

108
00:06:52,409 --> 00:06:54,040
Sure. Whatever.

109
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,240
Sleep tight.

110
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,950
Sleep tight.

111
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,660
And happy birthday to you.

112
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,540
Do you really have
no intention of directing?

113
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,659
No. I like filming.

114
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,909
Why do you ask?

115
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,409
I just think it's nice to give it a try.

116
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:50,580
I think directors are the people who want
to express something with unique vision.

117
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,450
But I'm not that kind of a person.

118
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:57,240
SORRY I DIDN'T COOK ANYTHING FOR
YOUR BIRTHDAY. HAPPY BIRTHDAY. MOM

119
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,740
But it's not like I have any story to
tell, nor do I have confidence in myself.

120
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:11,160
I don't think anyone will
find my story appealing.

121
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,540
THIS YEAR'S FILM DIRECTOR,
PARK HAE-YOUNG

122
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,370
You'll be awesome

123
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,700
in whatever you do.

124
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,120
Can I film your final-term movie?

125
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,160
Don't. I don't like having
my photograph taken.

126
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,240
This is for our photo assignment.

127
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:31,950
Well, if you want. Why not?

128
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,320
It's something for your birthday.

129
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:46,950
COUPON FOR VISITS TO MY HOUSE
BY SI-YEONG

130
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,200
My sister made them.

131
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,160
They're for you when filming.

132
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,740
MID-TERM EXAM
There are certain times of a day

133
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:08,660
that people visit the Anyangcheon Stream,
and it wasn't packed all day long.

134
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,040
Before and after meal time,
a lot of people came to the stream.

135
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,910
Yes, I sent you the feedback.

136
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,950
I won't submit mine.

137
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,160
Yes.

138
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:35,200
I don't want to know anything about love.

139
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,780
How come?

140
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,700
It's childish and...

141
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,160
Jeez. I can't do this.

142
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,200
No way. I'm sorry.

143
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,240
Let's just go with it.

144
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,040
Ready.

145
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,660
Act 3, scene 31.

146
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,990
- Shit! Ouch.
- Are you okay?

147
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,320
How come?

148
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:53,990
Let's take seat first.

149
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,320
Hold on.

150
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:00,540
What is it?

151
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,200
This should be covered.

152
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,990
Jeez. I'm so tired.

153
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:10,490
I'm saying I don't want to end my
beautiful life waiting for so-called love.

154
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,660
You're impossible to talk to.

155
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:16,620
Yes, so good-bye.
I hope we never meet again.

156
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,660
Cut! Okay.

157
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,490
Good job.

158
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,780
Good job, you guys.

159
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,700
Let's get something to eat.
What shall we have?

160
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,990
- Some drinks.
- That sounds awesome.

161
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,280
- What shall we eat?
- Fried chicken.

162
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,280
Fried chicken with soju.

163
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,990
Guys, I'm sorry.

164
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,280
- The sound isn't recorded.
- What?

165
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,580
Let's do it again.

166
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,870
Let's do it quick.

167
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:41,950
Da-woon did a good job controlling
ISO and aperture outside.

168
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:48,200
If he had opened the aperture a little
more, the depth would've been shallower.

169
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,450
Yes.

170
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,490
You look awesome.

171
00:11:57,490 --> 00:12:01,320
This 'magic hour' is called
the time between dog and wolf.

172
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:05,200
When seeing a man walking toward you
at this time of a day,

173
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,280
you're not sure if it's the dog of
your side or the wolf of your enemy.

174
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,490
Because of that charm, this particular
technique is used often in movies.

175
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,830
Thanks.

176
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,080
- Why is it always me?
- Hello.

177
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,700
- Hello.
- Hi.

178
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,240
- Hi, Si-won.
- Hello.

179
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,160
Did you see the result?

180
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,830
What result?

181
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,040
'My running bike.'

182
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,990
Your scenario ranked the first place.

183
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,620
It looks like you just found that out.

184
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,450
I made a phone call to the T.A.'s office.

185
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:44,450
I want to know the exact
examination standard.

186
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:47,280
I mean, you and Da-woon are close, right?

187
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:50,280
This contest exhibit was held by
Da-woon's parents.

188
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,080
Da-woon's father is the CEO
of the production company.

189
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,910
His mother is Director Park Hae-yeong.

190
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,240
It looks like you didn't know.

191
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:03,080
I heard that's why we got
that contest here out of the blue.

192
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,160
I'm not saying it's shady.

193
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,160
He can win the first place.

194
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,950
Never mind.

195
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,870
Enjoy your time.

196
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,280
It's not that.

197
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,990
I never...

198
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,200
Si-won.

199
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:27,160
You do stab in the back hard, don't you?

200
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,740
You said you wouldn't submit it.

201
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,370
What an ass.
