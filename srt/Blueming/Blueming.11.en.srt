1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:04,120
If you're being this way,

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,700
what can I do with you in the future?

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:11,500
What do you think?

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,700
It makes me more upset

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,460
that you're being this way with me.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,910
BLUEMING
COLORED BY YOU

7
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,410
I've finally faced myself who has been
neglecting to see what was going on.

8
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:29,789
ARE WE SERIOUSLY OVER?

9
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:51,789
Are you up now? Come and sit down.
Let's eat.

10
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:54,080
He wants to go to Jeju Island.

11
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,580
Sounds good. We can
get some fresh air there.

12
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:59,870
What are you doing there?
Come here and sit.

13
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:06,870
My heart keeps thumping. Do you think
it's because I drank too much coffee?

14
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,750
I told you quit drinking coffee.
You won't get sound sleep.

15
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,540
I know I should.

16
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,329
Shall we watch a movie together
after the meal?

17
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:20,370
What are you saying? We have shooting
to do tomorrow. We should go to bed early.

18
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:24,460
Right. When shall we go to Jeju Island?

19
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,000
August should be good.

20
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,370
I'll have some time to rest then.

21
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,500
We can always make time.

22
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,660
It's okay.

23
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:08,040
The kid who kidded himself
that he's already become an adult

24
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,620
has lost his chance
to become a proper adult.

25
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,460
This one?

26
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:43,200
I'll take this one.

27
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,290
No, this is for someone else.

28
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,870
Someone else who?

29
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,750
Yun-jeong.

30
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,200
ARE WE SERIOUSLY OVER?

31
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,240
Where are you off to?

32
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,960
He'll probably ride a bike.

33
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,580
Then get some milk on your way back home.

34
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,830
Sure.

35
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:09,290
Be careful of the cars.

36
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,870
Okay.

37
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,580
Si-won.

38
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,410
What is it?

39
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,410
I wanted to talk to you in person.

40
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:39,080
I think I wanted to be perfect.

41
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,790
I think I screwed everything up.

42
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,080
I thought everything would be okay.

43
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,040
I thought everything would
pass if I sit by.

44
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,200
I didn't think things would escalate
this much. I'm sorry.

45
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:07,330
I guess I wanted to do something for
you because of my feelings towards you.

46
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,910
Seeing you in pain right next to you,
I couldn't say anything.

47
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,040
I should have been honest. I'm sorry.

48
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:26,200
It's all my fault.

49
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,540
It won't happen again.

50
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:47,960
Am I too late?

51
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:08,870
Everything becomes fine when
you say it like this.

52
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,870
After everything I said to you...

53
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,120
I couldn't go back on my words.

54
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:16,410
It was your fault.

55
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,500
I felt like you made me feel like
a parasite. You really hurt my pride.

56
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:24,580
Do you have any idea how miserable I felt?

57
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,460
I thought you didn't want
anything to do with me.

58
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:35,620
Whatever.

59
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,700
I won't work with you anymore.

60
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,460
You could have said all this way earlier.

61
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,080
Were you playing with me?

62
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,540
Thank you.

63
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,000
Whatever.

64
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,580
And...

65
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:25,660
I didn't mean it when I said,
you gave me creeps.

66
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,330
I'm sorry about that.

67
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,580
Don't be. It's okay.

68
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:38,660
You don't need to be sorry.

69
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
This is so annoying.

70
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,500
You really hurt me.

71
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,200
I did too.

72
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,330
My ass.

73
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,830
Why didn't you just call me
when you came here?

74
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,580
I practiced on my speech.

75
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,750
Then...

76
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,580
I was in my third year of high school.

77
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:55,080
I came here to think about

78
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,830
if I really wanted to pursue film

79
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,240
or if it's just because I've grown up
watching movies all my life.

80
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,290
I had no one to talk to

81
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:17,700
so I came here to think alone.

82
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,540
But now,

83
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,580
I've already come here with you twice.

84
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,000
Whatever.

85
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,910
This is your last chance, you know?

86
00:13:57,290 --> 00:14:00,160
I'm not going to work with you anyway.

87
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,830
There's one thing I realized
while shooting.

88
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:16,960
I think I like shooting people I like.

89
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,700
What do you mean?

90
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:25,460
I'm saying, I prefer people over stories.

91
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,000
So?

92
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,200
Really?

93
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,700
Why?

94
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,580
Isn't it good too?

95
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:52,460
What? Is it because of me?

96
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:55,700
No way.

97
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,500
You silly.

98
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:00,460
It's not like that.

99
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,750
Whatever.

100
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,120
This is nice.

101
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,080
It's so nice.

102
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,960
I love it like this.

103
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:25,500
I love it a lot.

104
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,240
We lived happily ever after

105
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:26,410
as if the last part is
the beginning of the life.

106
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,290
I guess it's the starting
point of our lives

107
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:35,620
where we learn one thing after another
about ourselves.

108
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:42,330
Wishing everything about our lives
that are dream-like

109
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:46,040
last forever.
