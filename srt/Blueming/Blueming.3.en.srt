1
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,190
Aren't you sleeping?

2
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,940
BLUEMING
COLORED BY YOU

3
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,030
BAREUM UNIVERSITY

4
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:02,860
Si-won!

5
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,320
Hello. How are you?

6
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,490
Where are you off to?

7
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,860
I just need to...

8
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:10,729
Did you get the text message too?

9
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,900
Oh, about the contest exhibit?

10
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,990
Yes.

11
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,270
I think it's about funding the graduates
so we can shoot graduation film.

12
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,360
Why don't you apply for it?

13
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,610
I can give you feedback on your scenario.

14
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,650
Sure.

15
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:30,150
I'll contact you soon. It would be
nice if you could be one of my staffs.

16
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,150
Sure. I can do it.

17
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:35,070
You look like you're capable of anything.

18
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:36,860
- Bye.
- Bye.

19
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,860
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

20
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:44,650
Isn't that Cha Si-won?

21
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,690
Cha Si-won!

22
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,860
- Hey.
- Have you eaten?

23
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,230
Yes, I have.

24
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,070
Hello.

25
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,110
PRODUCTION SUPPORT BY H-FILM
CONTEST EXHIBIT

26
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,690
The winner gets five million won.

27
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,110
EP 03. "LET ME IN"

28
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,150
Ouch. Hey.

29
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,230
Sorry.

30
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:24,150
Hold on.

31
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:27,110
Did you get home safe?

32
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,030
You left your socks.

33
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,780
- What is it?
- Jeez.

34
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,070
Who is it?

35
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,940
My gosh.

36
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,690
You're doing well.

37
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:20,899
How's it going?

38
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,690
Sorry, Professor.

39
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,780
Hey, when you turn on the light,
say so before you do it.

40
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,440
- Turning the light on.
- Okay.

41
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,230
We need a model to compare the color.

42
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:46,530
Who wants to be the model?

43
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,230
No one?

44
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:00,070
Would you like to try, Si-won?

45
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,110
Take a seat here.

46
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,190
Si-won.

47
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,530
Hey, Cha Si-won.

48
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:19,400
Yeah. What?

49
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:22,190
Don't you want to talk to me?

50
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,650
It's not that...

51
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,860
Why did you push me earlier?

52
00:05:29,030 --> 00:05:30,190
Huh?

53
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:36,610
I thought you wanted to be the model.

54
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,650
What the...

55
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,780
Why do you keep judging situations for me?

56
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,820
I'm sorry if you felt that way.

57
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:47,900
Whatever.

58
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,030
Hey, Si-won.

59
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:53,530
What? What is left there to say?

60
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:01,150
Your socks.

61
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,530
We have assignments to do.

62
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,860
Assignments?

63
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,990
Aren't you doing assignments?

64
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:14,150
We have space observation to do,
and we need to shoot a movie too.

65
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,820
I'll contact you later.

66
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,900
I'm sorry.

67
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,030
Are you okay?

68
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,190
He's such a pain in the ass.

69
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:41,990
Yes, that's right.

70
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,030
Okay.

71
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:53,150
Are you done showering?

72
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,530
Yes, I'm done.

73
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:57,610
Isn't your sister here yet?

74
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,320
She's here.

75
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:04,940
Aren't you cold?

76
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:06,900
I'm good.

77
00:07:13,570 --> 00:07:14,570
Hold on.

78
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,820
What are you? Some kind of pervert?

79
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,860
Hold on. It's still there.

80
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,780
Leave it. I'll do it.

81
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,690
I'm done.

82
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,690
Do you want something to drink?

83
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:58,110
Huh? What?

84
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,570
It's you, Yun-jeong.

85
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,650
Hello.

86
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,030
Have you had lunch?

87
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,360
Yes, I just had it at the cafeteria.

88
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,070
What happened to your hair?

89
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,940
Something happened to you?

90
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,270
I just wanted to have a hair cut.

91
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:17,820
Everyone keeps asking me that question.

92
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,150
Usually, girls cut their hair
when they're dumped.

93
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,610
I'm shooting a movie. Do you
want to be my art director?

94
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,730
It will be hard for me to participate
in graduation film as a freshman.

95
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:36,690
I haven't even got my own portfolio
that I don't think it's a good idea.

96
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,490
Oh, is that so?

97
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,940
I think you'll be good.

98
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:44,440
Don't feel pressurized.

99
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,820
Sure.

100
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,490
Personally...

101
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:54,110
I think you look better with long hair.

102
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,070
My mom cut it for me.

103
00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,570
Huh?

104
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,650
Oh, your mother did.

105
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,610
Yes.

106
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,190
Oh, is your mother a hairdresser?

107
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:08,940
It's a great job.

108
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,150
I was going to say your hair looks pretty.

109
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,490
I'll get going then.

110
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,860
Hello.

111
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:31,610
Is it true that your mom is a hairdresser?

112
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,900
Are you Si-won's sister?

113
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,490
Do you know him?

114
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,900
Yes.

115
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,990
I just met him today.

116
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,940
Can you...

117
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,820
I want to see you again.

118
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,610
Yun-jeong.

119
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,650
Hey.

120
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,360
Hey, is it okay?

121
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,780
Yeah.

122
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,940
I didn't like the color anyway.

123
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,610
I can do it again.

124
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,900
Are you okay?

125
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,690
Yeah. I'm good.

126
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,820
Thanks to you, I got to have a shower.

127
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:40,070
And I smell good.

128
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:44,690
Thanks for getting my clothes.

129
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:47,320
I should've been careful.

130
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,030
I'm sorry.

131
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,940
No. I'm the one who should be sorry.

132
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,690
What do you want to drink?

133
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:55,730
Thanks.

134
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,110
Thanks, Da-woon.

135
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,230
Right. My phone.

136
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,860
That's a good thing. I was going to...

137
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,070
- Thanks.
- Wait.

138
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,230
You'll catch a cold.

139
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,400
What do you think about Tuesday?

140
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:17,270
We have a class in the morning so we can
do the space observation.

141
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,490
Shall we make the group chat now?

142
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:22,030
I'll get right on it.

143
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,190
We haven't decided it yet,
but you're avoiding me again.

144
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,570
No.

145
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,110
Tuesday it is.

146
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,820
Tuesday.

147
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,780
Yes.
