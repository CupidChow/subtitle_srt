1
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,930
Say something!

2
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:22,510
What's the point of living like this?

3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,180
Nothing changes. You don't mean
anything to me now.

4
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,470
Do you want me to make a scene at
your office for you and that woman?

5
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:31,140
- Shall I do that?
- Go ahead.

6
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,430
Do whatever you want. Jeez!

7
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,140
- Hey! Where are you going?
- Gosh.

8
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:37,970
Your kids are just nine and ten years old.

9
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:40,760
What will they do if you leave like this?

10
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:51,970
My mom didn't divorce my dad even after
she found out that he was cheating on her.

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,850
Mommy is...

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,100
All I have is you now.

13
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,050
We'll be fine.

14
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,510
Let's make sure we don't get looked down.

15
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,720
Don't cry, mommy.

16
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,890
Don't cry, mommy.

17
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,430
Don't cry, mommy.

18
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:17,720
Mommy.

19
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:21,140
I have this one and this one.

20
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,550
Check this out.

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,930
I have the same one at home.

22
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,510
It's nothing fancy.

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,140
Is anyone worried about anything?

24
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,759
This is a worry-doll that takes away
your worries. Isn't it awesome?

25
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,470
My parents gave it to me
as my birthday present.

26
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:40,680
My mom told me to be nice to you.

27
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,140
To me? Why?

28
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:44,470
Your dad moved out, didn't he?

29
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,850
- That's not true.
- He's moved out.

30
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,470
My mom said, your dad left
to live with someone else.

31
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,509
Yu-jin and I heard everything.
Didn't we, Yu-jin?

32
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,600
Yeah.

33
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:58,759
Are you stupid? Stop looking at me,
you stupid gorilla.

34
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,890
Gorilla.

35
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,300
Let's go.

36
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:09,050
I had to be flawless
not to be looked down.

37
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,220
BLUEMING
COLORED BY YOU

38
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,890
ABOUT 3650 DAYS LATER

39
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,850
I had to be flawless
not to be looked down.

40
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,100
Here's the lecture plan for the year.

41
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,050
Check your team members.

42
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:50,050
CHA SI-WON, HYEONG DA-WOON

43
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,760
It's about creating a space,
looking into it, and make a storyline.

44
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:58,260
As you know, the scene of the scenario
is one of the most important factors

45
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:00,260
and you can think of it as the foundation.

46
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,140
Okay,

47
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,140
your assignment is to take pictures hourly

48
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,850
so you become aware of the difference
of the sunlight by the location of the sun.

49
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,720
Your team members are...

50
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,600
I'll make teams according to
your name order.

51
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,760
INTRODUCTION TO PRODUCTION ASSIGNMENT:
SUBMISSION OF 5-MINUTE OF SHORT FILM

52
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,970
So I made the teams randomly.

53
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:22,430
You're probably sick of having teams
under your name orders.

54
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,720
So I made them with random choices.

55
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,470
Jeez, Si-won and Da-woon are team again.

56
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,640
You must be fate.

57
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,930
Hey, Do Ba-wu, what are you drinking?

58
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,140
What do you want to drink, guys?

59
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,430
It's too much hassle to pay
a person by person.

60
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:42,760
It's on me this time. Place your orders.

61
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,890
Then...

62
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,430
- I'll just have iced Americano.
- Iced Americano.

63
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,850
- Thank you.
- I'll have iced Americano too.

64
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:51,640
I'll have the same.

65
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,760
How about you?

66
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,260
I'll have green tea frappucino
with an added shot

67
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,680
and have espresso whipping cream on top.

68
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:01,970
Sure.

69
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,800
I'm just kidding. I'll have
iced Americano too. Thank you.

70
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,430
EP 02. HOW TO SURVIVE AS A HUNK

71
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,850
Can I have five glasses of iced Americano?

72
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,470
Cheers!

73
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,300
- It's our first time to drink together.
- Right.

74
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,510
- Da-won is so caring.
- Si-won!

75
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,260
Excuse me.

76
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,260
- Oh, you're here.
- I know, he's so cool.

77
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:28,510
- Sorry, we're late.
- Don't be.

78
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,470
Let's see. Come this way.

79
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,220
- Hey, Da-woon.
- Yeah?

80
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,510
- I heard you're the top in the department.
- The top?

81
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,600
Who said there isn't a hunk
in the department of film studies?

82
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,180
Here he is. Jeez.

83
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,260
Why are you all about the look?

84
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,430
- Hey.
- Whatever.

85
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,010
Shut it.

86
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,140
What do you mean 'shut it?'

87
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,220
Don't you think you're being too harsh?

88
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,220
You shouldn't think like that.

89
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:55,470
Quentin Tarantino?

90
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,930
Wow, you have that vibe.

91
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:02,050
Who do you like?

92
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,050
I don't know yet.

93
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,050
Maybe it's because I haven't watched
a lot of movies.

94
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,390
I don't have a favorite film director.

95
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,140
- Si-won.
- Huh?

96
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:21,100
You're the leader of the class.

97
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,180
Don't you think you should visit
others' tables too?

98
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:26,050
Yes, why don't you do that?

99
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,640
You think so?

100
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,680
Okay. Excuse me.

101
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:34,100
What did he say? He's such a boomer.

102
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,850
What's wrong with hair?

103
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,890
Here comes the leader of the class.

104
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:41,140
Here he is.

105
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,470
Hey, you leader.

106
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:45,300
- He even brought his glass.
- Of course.

107
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,800
What were you talking about?
You looked like you were having fun.

108
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:48,850
- Us?
- Yeah.

109
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,180
What did we talk about?

110
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,850
We talked about movies.

111
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,260
We've been trashing about that.

112
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,300
What?

113
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:58,350
That senior guy at the orientation.

114
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:00,640
He said if it was annoying when people
ask what movies we like.

115
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,220
Isn't it natural to wonder
about that though?

116
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,890
What kind of movies do you like?

117
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,970
You can tell what kind of person you are
by the movies you like.

118
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,180
I like French nouvelle vague.

119
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,930
I like directors like François Truffaut
and Jean-Luc Godard.

120
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,550
- You must know a lot of movies.
- Not really.

121
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:24,350
You definitely are the leader material.

122
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,220
You're so cool.

123
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,390
Why do you like those movies?

124
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,550
You know, I just like them.

125
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:37,300
They're very realistic and cynical.

126
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,600
Which one's your favorite?

127
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:47,100
"A bout de souffle"

128
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,390
- "A bout de souffle?"
- There is.

129
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:51,890
- Yeah.
- What's that?

130
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:54,720
What do you like then?

131
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,390
Me?

132
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,680
I don't have a favorite yet.

133
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,010
Thank you.

134
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,430
I'm not going to tell you.

135
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,050
Why not?

136
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,930
Are you pissed at me?

137
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,010
Here we go.

138
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,050
Shall we make a toast?

139
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,850
I love to drink.

140
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:02,350
Are you okay?

141
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,050
Did you throw up?

142
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,680
Leave me alone.

143
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,390
Isn't that my bag?

144
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,720
Oh, yes.

145
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,930
You look like you drank a lot.

146
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,890
Why don't you go home first?

147
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,720
I'm not drunk.

148
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,550
You think you know everything.

149
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,550
You don't want others to see
you drunk, do you?

150
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:37,049
It looked like you cared about
how others see you.

151
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,600
Are you okay? Hey.

152
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,850
Yeah.

153
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:58,050
I knew something was fishy about you.

154
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,640
They should've seen this side of you.

155
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,800
You know what?

156
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,640
You...

157
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,760
There's something fishy about you.

158
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:11,890
What did you say?

159
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,600
You made me come to the place
you work on purpose.

160
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:17,300
It's like you wanted to show me
that you are superior.

161
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:18,680
What?

162
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,010
It's like that last Tuesday too.

163
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:24,800
You saw me in the lecture room but
you didn't even bother to say hello.

164
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,600
But when the others greeted me,
you then greeted me.

165
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,970
Last Tuesday?

166
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,930
Tuesday, on the day of the semester
general meeting.

167
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,800
No, I mean, at the beginning
of the semester.

168
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:36,850
You're off your face.

169
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:39,680
And you always look down on me.

170
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,550
I do?

171
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,850
I do?

172
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:46,640
You're a scary guy, Hong Da-woon.

173
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,300
Okay.

174
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,720
- You're awesome.
- That's not what I meant.

175
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,180
I know you're awesome,

176
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,890
but I don't' want us to be close.

177
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,550
I find you scary.

178
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,010
You know what I mean, yeah?

179
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,680
Did you laugh again?

180
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,350
It's not that.

181
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,300
Sorry, I did laugh.

182
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,930
You find me pathetic.

183
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,720
I've been thinking that you
and I are so alike.

184
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:27,220
I didn't think you'd feel
pressured around me.

185
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:31,100
Oh, when you're around people,
they feel pressured?

186
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,260
Jeez.

187
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,220
You're so narcissistic.

188
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:40,050
Hey,

189
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:44,600
you are born with everything
at the tip of your hands

190
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,350
and loved by your parents so much.

191
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:54,180
You're the exact type that I hate.

192
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,640
I...

193
00:10:56,890 --> 00:10:58,220
I...

194
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,140
No matter how hard I try,
there are things that I can't achieve.

195
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,300
There are things I just can't...

196
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,550
Are you crying? You're so drunk.

197
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,600
Okay, easy there.

198
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:20,760
- Get up.
- Because of you, my 20s are ruined.

199
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,680
Let's go. I know. Take it easy.

200
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,350
Let go of me.

201
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,760
Aren't they Si-won and Da-woon?

202
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,850
Can you drive first?

203
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,260
They must have been drunk a lot.

204
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,390
Where are we going?

205
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,760
Where am I?

206
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:37,180
You didn't tell me where you live.

207
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,720
It's so hot.

208
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,390
You'll get cold once you fall asleep.

209
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,680
You'll get cold once you fall asleep.
