1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,480
It's not that.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,180
I never...

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,350
Si-won.

4
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,680
You do stab in the back hard, don't you?

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,930
You said you wouldn't submit it.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,520
What an ass.

7
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,350
You, come here.

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,220
I said, come here.

9
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,260
You used my laptop, didn't you?

10
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:01,350
I never submitted my work.

11
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,980
Then it must be you. Am I wrong?

12
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,980
You know...

13
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:09,060
Why wouldn't you submit it
when you've already written it?

14
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,310
Hey!

15
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,430
I just wrote it when I was young.
Why would you do that?

16
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,560
Si-won.

17
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,890
Congratulations! I read
an article about you too!

18
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,850
Come back here. Hey!

19
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,180
Cha Si-yeong!

20
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,720
Open the door.

21
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,480
You're so dead.

22
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,220
Knock it off. Just enjoy
your success, dude!

23
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,310
BLUEMING
COLORED BY YOU

24
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:40,890
I never even once changed your diapers
when you were young.

25
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,560
You've said that a million times already.

26
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,310
I'm just saying this because
you should know.

27
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,100
Do you like your dad?

28
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:52,479
When did I say I like him?

29
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,479
You sometimes defend your dad.

30
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,220
No way.

31
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,850
You shouldn’t seen how shameless he was.

32
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:04,100
You know I did my very best
to protect you guys, right?

33
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:07,140
He's an ass who has
zero sense of responsibility.

34
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:10,479
It makes me furious just
by thinking about him.

35
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,430
Are you okay?

36
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,720
I heard Si-won won the contest.

37
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,310
Professor Min talked about you
in her lecture.

38
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:42,640
- I'm so proud of you.
- Congratulations.

39
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,350
Tell me if you want me
to be one of your staffs.

40
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:45,390
You can tell me too.

41
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:47,520
Next time I have a question regarding
production support, I'll ask you.

42
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,060
Can you share your scenario?

43
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,680
We're not worried thanks to Da-woon.

44
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:52,390
Thank you, Da-woon.

45
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,850
Do you think Da-woon's read the script?

46
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,980
EP 06. THE WORST DAY

47
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,100
Let's grab lunch.

48
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:22,310
We can have dinner too.

49
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,720
Sounds cool.

50
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,770
Hey, Cha Si-won.

51
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,600
Is that you?

52
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,680
Sorry?

53
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:36,260
We took a bet. This is you, isn't it?

54
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,220
This is him! I was right!

55
00:03:40,310 --> 00:03:42,520
What? Is this really you?

56
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:46,350
How is this person you?

57
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,600
I took a bet, and I'm lost.

58
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,260
Hey, you owe me 50,000 won.

59
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,520
Jeez.

60
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,480
Does this even make sense?

61
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,850
I can't believe this.

62
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,100
Where did you get this picture?

63
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,600
I heard there's a girl who went to
the same school with you, an Art major.

64
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,520
She's a friend of Hwan Yun-jeong

65
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,640
Go ask her.

66
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,850
I heard the commentary
will be released today.

67
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,220
Why don't you check that out too?

68
00:04:32,810 --> 00:04:34,060
Si-won.

69
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,310
Congratulations.

70
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,180
I've forgotten about this.

71
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,890
It's terrible to be
the subject of a rumor.

72
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,480
I forgot about it for a while.

73
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,100
You should treat us!

74
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:48,640
Although it was the first
production support business,

75
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:52,980
it was great to see how capable
the students were at Bareum University.

76
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:56,600
The Grand Prix Winning work,
"my running bike,"

77
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,640
portrays a boy finding himself
in a green, yet confident manner.

78
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,640
And this was done at the unique pace of
the director in a fresh take.

79
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,060
As mentioned at
the intention of production,

80
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,430
the story was autobiographical
which made the film sincere.

81
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,720
Now that the commentary is released,
you shouldn't worry anymore.

82
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:15,640
Right.

83
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,930
Why not show people your scenario?

84
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,100
Exactly.

85
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,810
I should've submit mine too
so it's easy to make an excuse.

86
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:24,720
I was going to write Da-woon's name
as a director of photography.

87
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:26,520
I should've submitted mine too.

88
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,220
But none of it would make any difference.

89
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,140
And it's not like you did
anything wrong, Si-won.

90
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,260
Exactly.

91
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:36,180
By the way, did you see that?

92
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,890
Some strange picture of you
was on the Intranet.

93
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,430
I saw that too.

94
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,890
Who cares about that? We're
college students now.

95
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,560
Who would upload something like that?
It's so freaking childish.

96
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:54,220
The end of the term is coming
so you shouldn't be bothered.

97
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,770
Si-won, are you okay?

98
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,350
Did you ask your parents?

99
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,310
It's not true, is it?

100
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,720
I haven't met them yet. They're so busy.

101
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,890
Why don't you call them up?

102
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,850
You never know.

103
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,060
Okay, I will.

104
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,060
It must have been so hard for you.

105
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:31,350
Everyone will see me differently now.

106
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:36,100
Why would they? Don't think that way.

107
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,180
I know none of that's true,

108
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:46,100
and I shouldn't be
this worked up about it.

109
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,390
But I haven't felt
this way for a long time.

110
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,680
Si-won,

111
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:05,520
like the girls said, if you show
your scenario, everyone will see...

112
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,520
You don't know that.

113
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:09,930
- Huh?
- You've never been my shoes.

114
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,430
So don't tell me what to do.

115
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,930
You'll never know how I feel.

116
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,679
Have you seen this picture?

117
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,429
Have you seen it?

118
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,140
Hey, let me see the next one.

119
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,220
Yu-jin, I know you went to the same
elementary school, but that's too much.

120
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,350
Hey.

121
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,260
What?

122
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,310
Stop acting like you're the center
of the universe.

123
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,890
What are you on about?

124
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:04,390
Da-woon brought your bike here.

125
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,100
- Hello.
- I'm shooting a film.

126
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:55,350
I know.

127
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,060
Is it urgent?

128
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,930
It's...

129
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,100
About the production support business...

130
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:05,220
Oh, the commentary? You asked
me to write it, didn't you?

131
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,930
Don't you like it?

132
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,640
Yes, I do.

133
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,100
I like it.

134
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:12,930
Okay, let's meet the day
after tomorrow when I have time.

135
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,560
I'd better get going now.

136
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,770
Where are you?

137
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:32,260
I'm on my way to your house. Let's talk.

138
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,390
Why would you run?

139
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,850
You said you were on your way here.

140
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,260
I heard you brought my bike home.

141
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,810
How did you crack the password?

142
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,560
I just put your birthday.

143
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,350
Why on earth do you like me?

144
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,310
You knew.

145
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,890
I didn't think you knew.

146
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,600
Gosh.

147
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,600
Take a look at this.

148
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:22,310
What do you think about this boy?
Tell me honestly.

149
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,180
He's so cute.

150
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,890
Don't lie. Give it to me straight.

151
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,890
I'm being honest.

152
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,980
He's so cute.

153
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,260
Look at his chubby cheeks.

154
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,350
That's me.

155
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,680
That's me, the fatty.

156
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,980
How cute.

157
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:59,680
Didn't you see it?

158
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,390
It was on the Intranet.

159
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,310
What?

160
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,480
I don't know. Things are so messed up.

161
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,890
I hate me of that time,

162
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,520
and it popped out suddenly.

163
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,480
And I didn't even think about releasing
the scenario since it's autobiographical,

164
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,600
and it happened so quick.

165
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:32,430
On top of everything, I even said
horrible stuff to you.

166
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,480
Aren't I pathetic?

167
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,600
I don't know why, but I
don't have confidence in myself.

168
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:50,310
I have a feeling that people won't like me
once they get to know me.

169
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,720
People tend to have preconceived views.

170
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,100
Once they find out about
my pathetic family story,

171
00:13:57,180 --> 00:14:00,180
they'll pity me thinking I had
unfortunate childhood

172
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:04,390
rather than seeing me as who I am.

173
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,100
I'm sorry.

174
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,680
I know it must have been hard for you,
but I just thought about myself.

175
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,430
No, it's okay.

176
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,930
I'm okay.

177
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,640
I know how hard it must have been for you.

178
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,680
I'm sorry.

179
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,100
I can't change the pathetic side of me.

180
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,520
I've been pathetic my whole life
that it must just show.

181
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,770
I want to be cool like you.

182
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,520
Cheer me up more.

183
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,560
I was worried that you
wouldn't like me anymore.

184
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,770
And I don't like French
Nouvelle Vague at all.

185
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,430
That stuff is harsh and it doesn't
give me any joy.

186
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:16,350
I admire that stuff, but I find
"Mean Girls" a lot more fun.

187
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,720
- I'll sleep over at your place today.
- What? Hang on.

188
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,850
Can I not?

189
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,930
