1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,530
It's good to try directing
as many times as you can.

2
00:00:03,650 --> 00:00:07,570
It would have been better if you wrote
the scenario and directed.

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,440
No. If you did, people would've talked.

4
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:17,650
If it wasn't you, his work
wouldn't have even made in the rank.

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,270
Thank you.

6
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,650
It looks like you two are very close.

7
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:27,230
I mean, the film wasn't done so well.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,900
We should've chosen one of the graduates.

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:34,530
No, it was green but fresh.

10
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,730
I hope it makes to the film festival
so I can go there have some fun.

11
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:46,110
EP 10. THE TIME BETWEEN DOG AND WOLF

12
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,360
Si-won,

13
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,690
it must have been awkward for you.
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:05,780
What are you sorry for?

15
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,490
My mom talked about some weird stuff.

16
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:12,320
Da-woon.

17
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:14,150
Yes.

18
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:16,820
Don't you have anything to tell me?

19
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,230
About what?

20
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:24,070
You asked your parents
to pick mine, didn't you?

21
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,940
No. What are you saying?

22
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,730
You know what I'm saying.

23
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:30,780
No.

24
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:32,990
I heard everything. Stop lying.

25
00:01:34,570 --> 00:01:35,650
No.

26
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:39,400
No?

27
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,110
Hey...Stop.

28
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,690
Hang on, Si-won.

29
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,530
I meant good.

30
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:57,150
I wanted the best for you, so I...

31
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:00,900
That's why I did it. Can't you
think of it as me being thoughtful?

32
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,820
Being thoughtful?

33
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,440
Did you just say, being thoughtful?

34
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,820
No.

35
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:08,860
No.

36
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:13,690
I think I made a mistake.
That's not what I meant.

37
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,360
Si-won...

38
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,230
Your work was picked because
your scenario was good.

39
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,070
If it wasn't good, it wouldn't have...

40
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,610
You really are...

41
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,990
Do you know what hurt my pride the most?

42
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:34,900
Knowing that you did this, I couldn't
do anything in front of your mom.

43
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:38,730
I was afraid if I said anything, it would
ruin my career in film business.

44
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,730
I couldn't say anything.

45
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,940
Isn't that funny?

46
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,150
Aren't I pathetic?

47
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,780
You knew it. You're a smart guy.

48
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,690
You didn't think people would just
let it go if I win this award.

49
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,150
But still, you...

50
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:58,070
You just went ahead with it anyway.

51
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,440
You just let it pass pretending
you didn't know.

52
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:13,440
So don't tell me you
were being thoughtful.

53
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,650
You give me creeps thinking
that you fooled me all this time,

54
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,400
pretending not knowing anything
with that innocent face of yours.

55
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:40,570
BLUEMING
COLORED BY YOU

56
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,530
What's with the dinner?

57
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,150
Apparently you don't like
the protein shake.

58
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:39,570
What's with the pout? It's not like you.

59
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,270
Si-yeong told me that
you watched the film.

60
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,070
How can you portray
your parents like that?

61
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,490
That mother in your film always
fights with people. What's with that?

62
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,820
I tried so hard raising you guys so people
wouldn't judge you for not having a dad.

63
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,400
And all I did was for you.

64
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:04,940
It looked as if I'm some crazy woman who
makes you do things you don't want to.

65
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,730
Stop it. It's all in the past.

66
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,360
Talk to me.

67
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:12,530
I want to know.

68
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,190
You and Si-yeong grew up just fine
with not much problem.

69
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:23,360
I didn't have much, but I tried so hard
to raise you on my own.

70
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,030
I never wanted anything from you.

71
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:27,320
What?

72
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,570
It's possible that I felt that way, no?

73
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:33,570
I did everything for you. What do
you mean, feeling that way?

74
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,110
You said you shot your fiml here
since the house is pretty.

75
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,110
But you revealed all the family story.

76
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:42,270
What if anyone notices that's our story?

77
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,360
It won't turn into a movie,
so don't you worry about that.

78
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:47,780
Hey, Cha Si-won! Eat your dinner.

79
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,820
You said you wanted to eat
meals cooked by your mom.

80
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,570
Have I ever starved you?

81
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:54,650
Go eat your dinner now!

82
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,360
Don't you ever drink the protein shake!

83
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,320
After everything I did for you!

84
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,570
And don't blame me for anything!
I didn't do anything wrong.

85
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,650
Si-yeong is just fine. Why...

86
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:12,730
Mom.

87
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,940
I'm sorry, mom.

88
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:20,610
Mom never said sorry.

89
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,230
I don't think she'll ever
understand me completely

90
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:29,270
as I don't understand her.

91
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,570
Have you been waiting for long?

92
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,570
I'm sorry.

93
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:55,900
My friend is shooting tomorrow,
and she asked me to lend it.

94
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,570
It's okay.

95
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,440
Hello, Yun-jeong.

96
00:08:07,530 --> 00:08:08,990
Si-yeong.

97
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,530
When have you become so close?

98
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,070
You don't need to know.

99
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:18,900
Hey, why didn't you put it
in a bag and give it to her?

100
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,110
Will this be okay?

101
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,900
I'm good.

102
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,070
If you haven't eaten, do you want to
come in for dinner? We're eating now.

103
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:33,780
I want to, but I have a shooting to do
tomorrow, so I need to go now.

104
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,730
What a shame.

105
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:39,730
Si-yeong, look!

106
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,900
It suits you.

107
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:07,270
Hyeong Da-woon never called.

108
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,070
I'm all for the drinks during daytime

109
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,400
but we've already had
our drinking session.

110
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:40,440
More the merrier.

111
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,270
He probably has the support fund left.

112
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,070
Have you done the distribution?

113
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:47,900
I'm so tired from finishing up my work.

114
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:51,820
It's been ages that I finished filming,
but it never ends.

115
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:54,900
I won't submit my work.

116
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:55,990
- What?
- What?

117
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,570
- That's so sudden.
- What happened?

118
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,400
You've done everything. What's going on?

119
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:01,990
I just...

120
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:05,110
I don't feel confident in my film.

121
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:08,440
Okay, I get why you
don't want to submit it.

122
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:13,320
I heard no director can
watch his work again.

123
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,230
It's like your ex-lover.

124
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:21,490
Once you were madly
in love him, but now...

125
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:24,780
- An asshole.
- Right. An asshole.

126
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,650
Thanks, you guys.

127
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:28,490
But still!

128
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,230
But still!

129
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,780
Why would you not submit the work
you've already filmed?

130
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:39,690
Hey, you don't know the half of it.

131
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:43,270
It's so hard to reveal your work.

132
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,270
You haven't directed your own yet,
have you? Then you shouldn't talk.

133
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,820
What did you just say?

134
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:55,190
I don't have short-length scenario,
but I have a long-length one.

135
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,530
Which one? The celebrity
and the chef one?

136
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:01,610
Yes, that's the work I love.

137
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:05,490
Now, I have nothing...

138
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,320
I'll shoot it in six years.

139
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,490
Good luck with that.

140
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,110
Hey, you're crossing the line.

141
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:17,230
Si-won.

142
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,650
Did you just hit me?

143
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,730
Isn't Da-woon coming?

144
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,900
Hyeong Da-woon hasn't come
to the class from yesterday.

145
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,730
He's probably busy.

146
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,990
Let's drink up.

147
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,360
Hello, Si-yeong.

148
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,400
Sure.

149
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:50,730
Let's go for rose tteokbokki
we talked about then.

150
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:53,230
Sure.

151
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,610
Was it Cha Si-yeong?

152
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,940
Tell me if she bothers you.

153
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:03,900
She's still immature.

154
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:09,110
There comes Hyeong Da-woon.

155
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,570
What are you trying to do?

156
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:35,440
Why aren't you saying anything?

157
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,860
I'm sorry.

158
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,150
Is that all?

159
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,530
I'm sorry.

160
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,780
Okay.

161
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,190
I'm sorry too.

162
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,730
In my life, funnily,

163
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,690
I've been so insecure.

164
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,440
Every insecurity in my mind has come true.

165
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,360
If you're being this way,

166
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:37,820
what can I do with you in the future?

167
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,690
What do you think?

168
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:45,860
It makes me more upset

169
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,570
that you're being this way with me.
