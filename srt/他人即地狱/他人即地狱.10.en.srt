1
00:00:59,253 --> 00:01:02,253
(All places, names, organizations, groups...)

2
00:01:02,253 --> 00:01:05,098
(and religions in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:21,748
What kind of a studio is this?

4
00:01:34,493 --> 00:01:35,627
Let's go.

5
00:01:41,332 --> 00:01:42,568
What are you doing? Let's head in.

6
00:01:50,103 --> 00:01:51,417
(Soh Jung Hwa)

7
00:01:55,413 --> 00:01:59,587
(Police)

8
00:02:00,012 --> 00:02:01,188
Yes, Jong Woo?

9
00:02:01,812 --> 00:02:02,898
Hello?

10
00:02:04,323 --> 00:02:05,628
Jong Woo, are you there?

11
00:02:06,553 --> 00:02:07,628
Jong Woo,

12
00:02:08,392 --> 00:02:09,738
you were right.

13
00:02:10,223 --> 00:02:12,667
I think they're a whole group of murderers.

14
00:02:12,963 --> 00:02:15,032
We received a report at our Patrol Division today.

15
00:02:15,032 --> 00:02:16,878
I'm going into the studio right now.

16
00:02:18,463 --> 00:02:21,103
You can't go in.

17
00:02:21,103 --> 00:02:22,277
My girlfriend...

18
00:02:23,172 --> 00:02:26,188
- is trapped in the studio. - Your girlfriend?

19
00:02:26,872 --> 00:02:29,488
Then...

20
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:32,243
I'll head over.

21
00:02:32,243 --> 00:02:34,758
No, that will put Ji Eun in bigger danger.

22
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:39,967
What they want is for me to come here.

23
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:43,467
Ji Eun will be safe if I go in.

24
00:02:43,663 --> 00:02:46,708
You'll get hurt if you go in.

25
00:02:46,892 --> 00:02:50,337
Just stay right there. I'll head over.

26
00:02:50,502 --> 00:02:51,607
I have to go in.

27
00:02:53,203 --> 00:02:54,947
This won't end until I head in.

28
00:02:57,472 --> 00:02:58,848
Jong Woo?

29
00:03:01,143 --> 00:03:02,942
Jung Hwa,

30
00:03:02,942 --> 00:03:05,882
the knife we found at the scene has been tested.

31
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:07,882
The results suggest that it belongs to Ahn Hee Joong who's missing.

32
00:03:07,882 --> 00:03:09,483
- What? - District Investigation Team...

33
00:03:09,483 --> 00:03:12,327
is looking for him as a suspect, not as a missing person.

34
00:03:12,423 --> 00:03:14,393
They wouldn't leave behind evidence that easily.

35
00:03:14,393 --> 00:03:16,568
Where are you going? Everyone is here.

36
00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:19,393
Jong Woo just called. He's heading inside the studio.

37
00:03:19,393 --> 00:03:20,833
- Why would you... - I'm heading over there,

38
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:22,493
so call me if anything comes up.

39
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,607
But...

40
00:03:25,363 --> 00:03:27,348
- Still... - And Hyun Woo,

41
00:03:28,102 --> 00:03:30,677
if you can't reach me, please come for me.

42
00:03:40,282 --> 00:03:41,957
- Chang Hyun, - Yes?

43
00:03:42,252 --> 00:03:45,727
get out as soon as you feel like you're in danger.

44
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,128
I was on the judo team.

45
00:03:49,293 --> 00:03:51,667
- Get out as fast as you can. - Fine.

46
00:04:02,233 --> 00:04:03,318
What's this?

47
00:04:05,043 --> 00:04:06,718
They're here.

48
00:04:08,113 --> 00:04:09,248
Darn...

49
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:17,998
Be careful.

50
00:04:24,662 --> 00:04:32,737
(Episode 10. Gas-lighting)

51
00:04:34,972 --> 00:04:36,047
Okay.

52
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:40,588
The case...

53
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:44,258
is here.

54
00:05:07,733 --> 00:05:09,378
I think no one is here.

55
00:05:18,712 --> 00:05:19,787
Why?

56
00:05:37,332 --> 00:05:38,577
Be careful.

57
00:05:54,452 --> 00:05:58,527
(I've been waiting for you.)

58
00:05:58,752 --> 00:06:00,868
Maybe they're somewhere else.

59
00:06:02,752 --> 00:06:04,397
They're here.

60
00:06:53,942 --> 00:06:55,318
What are you doing?

61
00:06:56,043 --> 00:06:57,887
What are you doing? Get up quick!

62
00:06:57,913 --> 00:07:00,752
I suddenly feel so sleepy now that I've loosened up.

63
00:07:00,752 --> 00:07:02,928
We haven't found Ji Eun yet.

64
00:07:03,153 --> 00:07:05,628
Can't you get the laptop first?

65
00:07:06,122 --> 00:07:08,897
That's where all your work is saved.

66
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:17,678
Hey!

67
00:07:19,632 --> 00:07:21,478
Did you drink this?

68
00:07:23,493 --> 00:07:25,597
- What? - Did you drink this?

69
00:07:27,592 --> 00:07:29,708
How can you just drink anything?

70
00:07:30,892 --> 00:07:32,068
Jong Woo,

71
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,303
I can't move my body.

72
00:07:34,303 --> 00:07:36,547
Get up! Get it together.

73
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:38,547
- Wake up! - Well...

74
00:08:55,943 --> 00:09:00,128
Hey! Why did you get so scared?

75
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,068
Why are you at your desk?

76
00:09:12,863 --> 00:09:15,637
Where's Ji Eun? Where is she?

77
00:09:15,963 --> 00:09:20,442
Why do you keep looking for your girlfriend here?

78
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:21,772
Don't you think that's odd?

79
00:09:21,772 --> 00:09:23,617
Maybe I should find her first.

80
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:28,357
Stop talking nonsense.

81
00:09:28,383 --> 00:09:30,087
Tell him to come here.

82
00:09:30,312 --> 00:09:32,428
Tell him to come here right now.

83
00:09:35,652 --> 00:09:37,127
Here he is.

84
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:40,438
I knew you'd come back.

85
00:09:42,022 --> 00:09:43,507
What did you do to Ji Eun?

86
00:09:44,392 --> 00:09:46,038
What did you do to Ji Eun?

87
00:09:46,192 --> 00:09:49,107
You know well what happened to her.

88
00:09:49,562 --> 00:09:52,148
Darn it. Stop spewing nonsense.

89
00:09:52,703 --> 00:09:54,977
I'll kill you if you do.

90
00:09:56,412 --> 00:09:59,517
All right, kill your friend with that knife first.

91
00:09:59,713 --> 00:10:01,357
Then I'll let your girlfriend go.

92
00:10:01,713 --> 00:10:02,857
What?

93
00:10:05,983 --> 00:10:09,398
You don't even have a backup plan. Why hesitate?

94
00:10:11,392 --> 00:10:13,093
- What's this? - I went to get my laptop fixed...

95
00:10:13,093 --> 00:10:14,993
and the store was having a giveaway event.

96
00:10:14,993 --> 00:10:16,668
This is the prize for the last place.

97
00:10:17,062 --> 00:10:20,032
It's cute. I'll put it on my bag, thank you.

98
00:10:20,032 --> 00:10:21,137
No problem.

99
00:10:24,203 --> 00:10:26,107
This is going to be fun.

100
00:10:29,103 --> 00:10:30,487
He's so brave.

101
00:10:31,912 --> 00:10:33,048
What?

102
00:10:33,312 --> 00:10:34,458
Jong Woo,

103
00:10:34,883 --> 00:10:36,528
what are those people saying?

104
00:10:38,853 --> 00:10:40,127
You won't do that, right?

105
00:10:42,052 --> 00:10:43,168
Jong Woo.

106
00:10:57,873 --> 00:10:59,477
This is going to be fun.

107
00:11:06,512 --> 00:11:09,288
You'll hurt your wrist if you try to grab it.

108
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:12,727
Nice.

109
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:15,482
He can't move,

110
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:17,028
he's fat,

111
00:11:17,453 --> 00:11:18,997
and dumb.

112
00:11:19,863 --> 00:11:22,038
Should I sell you off to Jagalchi Market?

113
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:27,798
This is the story I've been writing since I moved into this studio.

114
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:31,308
Right.

115
00:12:32,932 --> 00:12:35,278
Before I moved in here,

116
00:12:35,902 --> 00:12:38,107
I thought the world that I lived in...

117
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:40,247
was hell itself.

118
00:12:46,213 --> 00:12:47,617
Being impoverished.

119
00:12:49,012 --> 00:12:50,987
A burdensome brother.

120
00:12:52,483 --> 00:12:53,958
My poor mother.

121
00:12:54,853 --> 00:12:57,698
The army and the college.

122
00:12:59,392 --> 00:13:00,568
But...

123
00:13:01,593 --> 00:13:03,637
this is where the real hell is.

124
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:08,278
Horrendous hell...

125
00:13:09,062 --> 00:13:10,548
created by strangers.

126
00:13:12,802 --> 00:13:14,347
What brings you here?

127
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:23,887
Oh my goodness. You're just eating out all the ham.

128
00:13:24,483 --> 00:13:26,452
I can't do this well now that I'm in a hurry.

129
00:13:26,453 --> 00:13:27,757
Jong Woo!

130
00:13:29,853 --> 00:13:32,392
Jong Woo, just hold on for a moment. Food is almost ready.

131
00:13:32,392 --> 00:13:33,938
I'm late.

132
00:13:48,573 --> 00:13:49,747
I'm leaving now.

133
00:13:50,113 --> 00:13:51,672
Jong Woo, it's ready!

134
00:13:51,672 --> 00:13:54,188
- Jong Woo, take these. - I'm late.

135
00:13:54,343 --> 00:13:57,182
Jong Woo, take these.

136
00:13:57,182 --> 00:13:58,753
Take these.

137
00:13:58,753 --> 00:14:00,583
- Here. - All right. I'm leaving now.

138
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:03,652
Make sure to eat all three meals even if things get busy.

139
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:05,223
I can take care of myself.

140
00:14:05,223 --> 00:14:06,467
Jong Woo,

141
00:14:07,963 --> 00:14:09,767
be careful of people.

142
00:14:11,062 --> 00:14:13,438
People are the scariest creatures.

143
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,227
Ji Eun.

144
00:14:37,593 --> 00:14:38,828
Ji Eun!

145
00:14:40,892 --> 00:14:42,168
Ji Eun.

146
00:14:44,993 --> 00:14:46,107
Ji Eun.

147
00:14:47,062 --> 00:14:48,208
Min Ji Eun.

148
00:14:51,103 --> 00:14:52,247
Ji Eun!

149
00:14:55,542 --> 00:14:58,847
How does it feel? When your doubts become certain,

150
00:14:59,442 --> 00:15:00,717
doesn't it feel thrilling?

151
00:15:00,883 --> 00:15:02,188
What did you do?

152
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:06,058
What did you do to Ji Eun?

153
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,328
I was trying to finish this.

154
00:15:10,753 --> 00:15:14,097
Look over here. This is Ji Eun's.

155
00:15:14,593 --> 00:15:15,737
Isn't this pretty?

156
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:23,038
What are you doing to us?

157
00:15:25,203 --> 00:15:27,148
What are you doing to us?

158
00:15:29,142 --> 00:15:31,017
She's not dead yet.

159
00:15:32,613 --> 00:15:34,857
I just put her under for a moment.

160
00:15:47,262 --> 00:15:48,497
Listen carefully...

161
00:15:49,662 --> 00:15:51,438
to what I'm about to tell you.

162
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:55,337
I'm pretty sure...

163
00:15:56,133 --> 00:16:00,117
this will be interesting for you too.

164
00:16:05,542 --> 00:16:07,158
I'll spare you.

165
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:49,857
Jong Woo.

166
00:16:57,662 --> 00:16:58,767
Who's there?

167
00:16:59,532 --> 00:17:02,007
My gosh, you're going to shoot me with that?

168
00:17:02,302 --> 00:17:03,408
Don't move.

169
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:06,877
Look at you, dropping the honorifics.

170
00:17:07,343 --> 00:17:08,747
What have I done wrong?

171
00:17:08,942 --> 00:17:10,117
Where is Jong Woo?

172
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:12,517
Why are you asking me that?

173
00:17:12,613 --> 00:17:14,158
He didn't come here.

174
00:17:18,152 --> 00:17:21,353
Jong Woo, this is Jung Hwa. If you're here, scream.

175
00:17:21,353 --> 00:17:23,528
- Jong Woo. - "My gosh!"

176
00:17:23,623 --> 00:17:25,727
Gosh, you're scaring me.

177
00:17:26,323 --> 00:17:28,898
I don't think you should behave like that.

178
00:17:36,662 --> 00:17:38,007
Jung Hwa, where are you?

179
00:17:39,103 --> 00:17:41,017
Jung Hwa. What's this noise?

180
00:17:41,503 --> 00:17:42,578
Jung Hwa.

181
00:17:42,843 --> 00:17:45,642
Jung Hwa. Are you all right?

182
00:17:45,642 --> 00:17:46,787
Sir!

183
00:17:47,013 --> 00:17:48,817
Where are you now? Are you at the studio?

184
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:53,698
You can't even do your job right.

185
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:10,777
Who cares? We're going to leave here anyway.

186
00:18:11,773 --> 00:18:13,077
Lock her up in the basement.

187
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:16,477
Not on the fourth floor? In the basement?

188
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:19,487
The handsome guy is on the fourth floor.

189
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,918
We should her and the thug some privacy.

190
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:27,928
I think the police will be coming here soon.

191
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:30,297
They don't have any warrant. What can they do?

192
00:18:30,652 --> 00:18:32,823
I'll take care of them. Just take care of her.

193
00:18:32,823 --> 00:18:35,868
My gosh, you're going to act again.

194
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:40,138
Actually, my dream was becoming an actress.

195
00:18:45,373 --> 00:18:47,418
You should carry an umbrella.

196
00:19:56,402 --> 00:19:58,388
Look at this. Look.

197
00:19:58,813 --> 00:20:00,783
That woman pushed me like this.

198
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:02,017
That must have hurt.

199
00:20:02,142 --> 00:20:04,482
By the way, I think you must have gotten the wrong idea.

200
00:20:04,482 --> 00:20:06,152
What do you mean?

201
00:20:06,152 --> 00:20:07,752
I want you to arrest her right now.

202
00:20:07,752 --> 00:20:09,523
If you don't, I'll report her to the National Police Agency.

203
00:20:09,523 --> 00:20:12,692
Excuse me, ma'am. Are you sure Jung Hwa really hurt you?

204
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:14,497
Are you calling me a liar?

205
00:20:14,662 --> 00:20:16,063
It's just that we can't reach her.

206
00:20:16,063 --> 00:20:18,967
Why would I lie about this?

207
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:20,977
Please calm down.

208
00:20:21,103 --> 00:20:23,232
We'll leave after we check she's not here.

209
00:20:23,232 --> 00:20:26,103
My gosh, how many times must I say this for you to understand?

210
00:20:26,103 --> 00:20:28,343
That witch grabbed my arm and pushed me like this.

211
00:20:28,343 --> 00:20:30,873
- "Witch"? Watch your language. - Hey, hey.

212
00:20:30,873 --> 00:20:32,343
What else should I call her then?

213
00:20:32,343 --> 00:20:33,942
- What are you doing? Stop it. - I mean...

214
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:35,287
- She called Jung Hwa a witch. - Stop it.

215
00:20:35,383 --> 00:20:37,853
- Don't say anything. - You're giving me a headache.

216
00:20:37,853 --> 00:20:40,823
Ma'am, let me call you an ambulance. Why don't you go inside...

217
00:20:40,823 --> 00:20:42,182
- Sir, we must check this. - My head is ringing.

218
00:20:42,182 --> 00:20:44,593
- I can't breathe. - Once I get a hold of her,

219
00:20:44,593 --> 00:20:45,892
- I'll take care of this. - My goodness.

220
00:20:45,892 --> 00:20:47,168
- Sure. - Okay.

221
00:20:47,462 --> 00:20:48,863
She's not a police officer.

222
00:20:48,863 --> 00:20:50,263
- She's a thug. - Hey, let's leave.

223
00:20:50,263 --> 00:20:51,507
- I have a headache. - Hey, come with me.

224
00:20:53,662 --> 00:20:55,678
How could she do such a thing?

225
00:20:55,833 --> 00:20:58,007
Goodness. How could she do that?

226
00:21:00,472 --> 00:21:01,777
Darn it.

227
00:21:05,242 --> 00:21:07,113
- She's not answering, right? - Her phone is turned off too.

228
00:21:07,113 --> 00:21:09,557
Hey, no one made a report. Do you have a warrant?

229
00:21:09,843 --> 00:21:11,613
We need a warrant to go in and search.

230
00:21:11,613 --> 00:21:12,952
But her phone...

231
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:15,327
Hey, her phone could be off.

232
00:21:15,823 --> 00:21:16,898
Come on out.

233
00:21:26,063 --> 00:21:28,708

When can I expect the article?

235
00:21:51,964 --> 00:21:53,639
I'll be posted this evening.

236
00:21:54,395 --> 00:21:55,869
It'll be huge.

237
00:21:56,635 --> 00:22:00,450
I'll post a comment when it's out.

(We express our condolences to Jo Yu Cheol.)

241
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,514
He's dead? What?

242
00:22:15,514 --> 00:22:17,954

("Freelance Reporter Found Dead on a Mountain in Eunhye-dong")

244
00:22:22,095 --> 00:22:25,365
Darn it. Did he figure it out?

245
00:22:25,365 --> 00:22:26,695
You can do the rest.

246
00:22:26,695 --> 00:22:28,270
Really?

247
00:22:28,964 --> 00:22:30,809
Yes. I need...

248
00:22:31,865 --> 00:22:33,539
to go somewhere.

249
00:22:33,905 --> 00:22:35,079
Where?

250
00:22:36,335 --> 00:22:38,375
Before we leave here,

251
00:22:38,375 --> 00:22:40,690
we need to take care of smelly things.

252
00:22:40,744 --> 00:22:45,020
Darn it. When did this guy die? Darn it.

253
00:22:45,885 --> 00:22:47,430
When did he die?

254
00:23:40,675 --> 00:23:48,020
(Police)

255
00:23:57,585 --> 00:23:59,299
The landlady...

256
00:23:59,885 --> 00:24:02,369
has left the cute one alive...

257
00:24:03,625 --> 00:24:05,670
and hidden away.

258
00:24:14,575 --> 00:24:16,250
The skin's so soft.

259
00:24:19,504 --> 00:24:20,589
My knife...

260
00:24:21,314 --> 00:24:23,589
will go in so easily.

261
00:25:16,865 --> 00:25:18,010
Mister.

262
00:25:20,575 --> 00:25:23,109
You're the one who touched my property?

263
00:25:23,974 --> 00:25:27,044
There's no private property. We're all family.

264
00:25:27,044 --> 00:25:29,490
Family? We're family?

265
00:25:29,845 --> 00:25:31,020
How dare you?

266
00:26:04,885 --> 00:26:07,230
(Police)

267
00:26:10,284 --> 00:26:13,629
I told you not to touch another person's belongings.

268
00:26:18,564 --> 00:26:20,470
Goodbye, mister.

269
00:26:20,534 --> 00:26:22,039
Goodbye.

270
00:26:24,564 --> 00:26:26,210
Darn the blood.

271
00:26:26,335 --> 00:26:27,609
Goodbye.

272
00:26:45,024 --> 00:26:47,730
I think we should leave soon.

273
00:26:48,395 --> 00:26:49,799
Wait.

274
00:26:52,064 --> 00:26:55,410
I can't wait much longer.

275
00:26:55,734 --> 00:26:58,940
We shed too much blood because of the young man.

276
00:26:59,764 --> 00:27:01,650
Do you still not trust me?

277
00:27:02,274 --> 00:27:04,279
It's not that I don't trust you,

278
00:27:04,774 --> 00:27:07,520
but I can't stand you talking back at me.

279
00:27:08,274 --> 00:27:11,415
Don't worry. You raised me.

280
00:27:11,415 --> 00:27:12,859
That's right.

281
00:27:13,314 --> 00:27:16,260
You owe me, so you should be respectful.

282
00:27:20,125 --> 00:27:24,200
Oh, and can we move to a cooler climate?

283
00:27:24,294 --> 00:27:25,470
Sure.

284
00:27:26,964 --> 00:27:29,135
Can you check on the man from Unit 303?

285
00:27:29,135 --> 00:27:31,510
They should be almost done by now.

286
00:27:31,865 --> 00:27:33,309
Are you sure?

287
00:27:33,764 --> 00:27:34,950
No.

288
00:27:37,274 --> 00:27:38,549
The kitchen.

289
00:27:39,145 --> 00:27:40,520
How come?

290
00:27:50,054 --> 00:27:54,170
Mr. Unit 303. Let's play.

291
00:27:55,554 --> 00:27:57,700
Where... What's going on?

292
00:28:01,494 --> 00:28:04,339
Is this what he does after all I did for him?

293
00:28:05,564 --> 00:28:07,879
Are you trying to stab me in the back?

294
00:28:25,325 --> 00:28:27,369
I know you're there.

295
00:28:34,264 --> 00:28:35,710
Where are you?

296
00:28:36,665 --> 00:28:38,779
You can't hide forever.

297
00:28:41,105 --> 00:28:43,549
You must do as I say.

298
00:28:44,845 --> 00:28:46,650
Don't disobey me.

299
00:28:50,214 --> 00:28:51,760
Mun Jo.

300
00:28:55,954 --> 00:28:58,660
I found him starving and brought him up.

301
00:29:01,195 --> 00:29:02,700
Where are you?

302
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:04,700
Where are you?

303
00:29:11,734 --> 00:29:14,010
If I'd known this would happen,

304
00:29:14,034 --> 00:29:17,180
I'd have killed the young lady in the basement.

305
00:29:34,155 --> 00:29:39,139
(Police)

306
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:15,809
The landlady's dead.

307
00:30:18,665 --> 00:30:20,010
So is...

308
00:30:21,204 --> 00:30:22,410
my brother.

309
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:31,490
I guess you should...

310
00:30:31,744 --> 00:30:33,359
die as well.

311
00:30:49,294 --> 00:30:51,579
What are you doing up here?

312
00:30:58,744 --> 00:30:59,819
Why?

313
00:31:00,575 --> 00:31:02,420
Will you kill me with that?

314
00:31:02,514 --> 00:31:06,415
Darn it. You catch on too quickly.

315
00:31:06,415 --> 00:31:11,359
Come on. I'm not quick-witted. You're just stupid.

316
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:14,029
Shut up, you jerk.

317
00:31:21,234 --> 00:31:22,865
Does that hurt?

318
00:31:22,865 --> 00:31:25,680
Doesn't that hurt like crazy?

319
00:31:27,405 --> 00:31:31,819
This is the problem with you.

320
00:31:33,974 --> 00:31:36,675
- You're stupid. - What?

321
00:31:36,675 --> 00:31:38,460
You should've pushed it all in.

322
00:31:44,325 --> 00:31:45,960
You know,

323
00:31:46,385 --> 00:31:48,369
you can never kill me.

324
00:31:48,595 --> 00:31:49,700
Guess why.

325
00:31:51,994 --> 00:31:53,440
In this world,

326
00:31:54,365 --> 00:31:56,170

It's from Sexual Offender's Crime Center.

The damage alert of an electronic ankle bracelet...

344
00:35:21,734 --> 00:35:22,834
came from Eden Studio.

Aren't you happy?

You can kill anyone you want.

Or keep them alive if you want.

349
00:36:01,945 --> 00:36:04,250
Doesn't it feel like you've become a deity?

Sure.

Then shall we put an end to the novel you were writing?

356

00:41:09,184 --> 00:41:10,929
Why are you doing this?

358
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,199
There has to be a reason?

359
00:41:17,055 --> 00:41:19,570
You know about human instincts.

360
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:22,509
The instinct...

361
00:41:23,595 --> 00:41:26,280
to gnaw on the weak,

362
00:41:27,705 --> 00:41:30,250
and enjoy...

363
00:41:31,205 --> 00:41:32,820
as the weak suffer.

364
00:41:40,115 --> 00:41:41,190
That's not true.

367
00:41:47,285 --> 00:41:48,530
won't do what you did.

I am not so sure about that.

369
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:56,340
You liked it...

370
00:41:58,104 --> 00:42:00,739
when people in the studio...

371
00:42:01,934 --> 00:42:03,250
died.

372
00:42:05,805 --> 00:42:08,050
Honey, now you and I...

373
00:42:10,314 --> 00:42:13,190
will be together forever.

374
00:42:13,430 --> 00:42:14,675
Stop spewing nonsense.

375
00:42:25,095 --> 00:42:29,139
Once you are dead, everything will be over.

376
00:42:33,334 --> 00:42:34,679
What are you doing?

377
00:42:38,245 --> 00:42:40,619
I will make sure you die a most painful death.

378
00:42:41,814 --> 00:42:43,150
You devil.

379
00:42:43,975 --> 00:42:45,460
You are...

380
00:42:46,745 --> 00:42:48,020
the best masterpiece...

381
00:42:48,984 --> 00:42:51,030
I ever created.

382
00:43:25,124 --> 00:43:30,630
(Police)

383
00:44:00,624 --> 00:44:01,695
(Eden Studio)

384
00:44:01,695 --> 00:44:02,969
- Move her. - Hurry.

385
00:44:06,464 --> 00:44:07,699
Are you hurt?

386
00:44:08,294 --> 00:44:09,670
How's your head?

387
00:44:10,234 --> 00:44:11,369
How is it?

388
00:44:12,604 --> 00:44:14,380
What about Jong Woo?

389
00:44:14,405 --> 00:44:17,650
Jong Woo? He's in the ambulance over there.

390
00:44:18,305 --> 00:44:20,079
I'm asking if you're okay.

391
00:44:23,044 --> 00:44:24,849
I'm glad.

392
00:44:25,945 --> 00:44:27,520
My goodness.

393
00:44:28,044 --> 00:44:29,214
Let's go.

394
00:44:29,214 --> 00:44:30,289
(Eden Studio)

395
00:44:59,745 --> 00:45:01,020
(Closed temporarily)

396
00:45:01,385 --> 00:45:03,489
What does "closed temporarily" mean?

397
00:45:24,575 --> 00:45:25,845
Where are you guys headed?

398
00:45:25,845 --> 00:45:27,504
- I can take... - I'll give you a ride.

399
00:45:27,504 --> 00:45:28,944
the bus over there.

400
00:45:28,945 --> 00:45:31,349
I'll grab a cab over there.

401
00:45:31,414 --> 00:45:32,590
Okay.

402
00:45:32,885 --> 00:45:34,719
- Good work. - Okay.

403
00:45:35,255 --> 00:45:36,560
Take care.

404
00:45:36,684 --> 00:45:37,989
Goodbye.

405
00:45:38,354 --> 00:45:39,600
Bye.

406
00:45:41,485 --> 00:45:42,929
Bye, Byung Min.

407
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:53,704
It has been confirmed that Seo, twin brothers, Byuns,

408
00:45:53,704 --> 00:45:55,934
and Hong, the residents of a studio...

409
00:45:55,934 --> 00:46:00,244
located in Eunhye-dong, had been committing hideous serial murders.

410
00:46:00,244 --> 00:46:04,474
They met at an orphanage 20 years ago and conspired to commit murders.

411
00:46:04,474 --> 00:46:06,985
It's highly likely that a murder of an entire family...

412
00:46:06,985 --> 00:46:08,854
at a vacation rental house...

413
00:46:08,854 --> 00:46:11,985
in Gyeonggi Province was executed by this group.

414
00:46:11,985 --> 00:46:13,055
Yun, the other resident of the studio...

415
00:46:13,055 --> 00:46:15,730
Sir, you heard about that incident, right?

416
00:46:16,155 --> 00:46:17,670
Of course.

417
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:19,969
I heard Ji Eun was connected to that incident.

418
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:23,040
Yes, I heard her boyfriend was an aspiring writer.

419
00:46:23,235 --> 00:46:25,380
I guess he was living in that studio.

420
00:46:25,434 --> 00:46:27,509
The comments sounded awful.

421
00:46:27,635 --> 00:46:30,409
Some people wrote that her boyfriend was a murderer.

422
00:46:30,974 --> 00:46:34,049
That's why you should be careful whom you date.

423
00:46:35,314 --> 00:46:38,545
Sir, we should get lunch. What do you want to get?

424
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,784
Still, he's cooperating on the police investigation.

425
00:46:41,784 --> 00:46:43,255
- Pizza. - Pizza?

426
00:46:43,255 --> 00:46:44,555
But we drank yesterday.

427
00:46:44,555 --> 00:46:46,699
I'm craving greasy food.

428
00:46:46,755 --> 00:46:48,555
Okay. Let's order pizza.

429
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:51,170
- Okay. - There's one around the corner.

430
00:46:55,330 --> 00:46:57,276
You're badly hurt.

431
00:46:58,031 --> 00:46:59,416
Mr. Ahn Hee Joong.

432
00:47:00,571 --> 00:47:02,115
Hey. Okay.

433
00:47:02,971 --> 00:47:04,385
Excuse me.

434
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,640
I'm Detective Lee Kwang Jae.

435
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,651
I worked with Detective Cha Sung Ryeol.

436
00:47:08,651 --> 00:47:11,511
You remember him, right? Detective Cha...

437
00:47:11,511 --> 00:47:13,221
Excuse me. Can't he talk?

438
00:47:13,221 --> 00:47:14,796
No, he can't.

439
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:19,595
Well...

440
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:21,931
I'm sure you probably don't want to remember it.

441
00:47:21,931 --> 00:47:24,235
We came here because we needed your statement.

442
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:26,135
- Hey. - Okay.

443
00:47:26,830 --> 00:47:28,405
Let me ask a few questions.

444
00:47:29,031 --> 00:47:32,015
Someone from Eden Studio tried to kill you, right?

445
00:47:32,471 --> 00:47:34,046
Who was that?

446
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:40,916
It's all right. They are gone now.

447
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,416
These people tried to kill you, right?

448
00:48:16,511 --> 00:48:18,055
Then what about Yun Jong Woo?

449
00:48:20,451 --> 00:48:22,365
Yun Jong Woo?

450
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:26,695
He was just an ordinary guy.

451
00:48:26,921 --> 00:48:29,805
He behaved like the guys his age.

452
00:48:31,330 --> 00:48:33,476
He wasn't the chatty type.

453
00:48:35,401 --> 00:48:39,175
But when he drank, he turned into a nasty guy.

454
00:48:39,801 --> 00:48:42,385
That's when I knew that he was hot-tempered.

455
00:48:43,210 --> 00:48:46,010
He seemed pretty cheerful when he first joined the company.

456
00:48:46,011 --> 00:48:48,586
But he started to look dejected.

457
00:48:49,750 --> 00:48:52,856
And he said that he'd work late even when we didn't ask him to.

458
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:57,920
I got the feeling that he didn't want to go home.

459
00:48:57,921 --> 00:49:00,566
He said he didn't want to go back to the studio.

460
00:49:00,861 --> 00:49:03,330
Whenever our CEO talked about the studio,

461
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:06,336
he would look upset too.

462
00:49:06,931 --> 00:49:09,175
Right. Reporter Jo was...

463
00:49:09,301 --> 00:49:13,171
in the office with just Jong Woo once.

464
00:49:13,171 --> 00:49:17,046
He told me that something creeped him out.

465
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,979
Creep him out?

466
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,055
Yes.

467
00:49:20,810 --> 00:49:24,785
Jong Woo talked about murderers as if they weren't a big deal.

468
00:49:25,210 --> 00:49:29,190
Besides, he was scary when he beat up Mr. Park.

469
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:32,996
I was beaten up in the office with a keyboard.

470
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:34,765
I was going to sue him.

471
00:49:35,861 --> 00:49:40,135
That jerk was a total psychopath.

472
00:49:42,131 --> 00:49:45,146
Right here. I had eight stitches here.

473
00:49:45,370 --> 00:49:47,945
I didn't do anything to him.

474
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:52,281
Darn it. That jerk...

475
00:49:52,281 --> 00:49:54,485
I'm sure...

476
00:49:55,011 --> 00:49:58,425
he conspired with that jerk and killed the CEO together.

477
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:00,750
I'm sure of it.

478
00:50:00,750 --> 00:50:04,566
People like him should be isolated from society forever.

479
00:50:04,750 --> 00:50:07,491
Please make that happen, Detectives.

480
00:50:07,491 --> 00:50:08,931
After hearing...

481
00:50:08,931 --> 00:50:12,460
that his girlfriend had been kidnapped by Seo Mun Jo,

482
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:13,931
Jong Woo went to the studio.

483
00:50:13,931 --> 00:50:17,376
He called me before he went inside.

484
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,841
What will happen to Jong Woo?

485
00:50:22,841 --> 00:50:24,285
- Yun Jong Woo? - Yes.

486
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:29,726
As for Jo Yu Cheol and Shin Jae Ho's murders,

487
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:33,220
we put him on the suspect list and investigated him.

488
00:50:33,221 --> 00:50:37,166
But there's no evidence or lead that points to him as the culprit.

489
00:50:37,221 --> 00:50:39,695
He did say that he killed Seo Mun Jo.

490
00:50:40,091 --> 00:50:42,365
Given the on-site examination,

491
00:50:42,730 --> 00:50:45,006
it will be considered as self-defense.

492
00:50:45,361 --> 00:50:46,976
I see.

493
00:50:47,431 --> 00:50:48,706
That's a relief.

494
00:50:50,671 --> 00:50:51,805
Then,

495
00:50:52,201 --> 00:50:56,171
except for Hong Nam Bok, Seo Mun Jo killed everyone?

496
00:50:56,171 --> 00:50:59,341
Yes. Eom Bok Soon killed Hong Nam Bok.

497
00:50:59,341 --> 00:51:03,055
And Seo Mun Jo killed Eom Bok Soon and Byun Deuk Jong.

498
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:05,111
We have circumstantial evidence for it,

499
00:51:05,111 --> 00:51:07,856
and Seo Mun Jo's fingerprints and blood to back it up.

500
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:13,166
Then, were they behind the incident at the vacation rental house?

501
00:51:13,221 --> 00:51:14,566
Probably.

502
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:17,506
- Ms. Soh. - Yes.

503
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:21,506
You said that you saw Eom Bok Soon killing Hong Nam Bok.

504
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:26,215
Yes, I was passed out that time, but I heard the noise.

505
00:51:26,701 --> 00:51:28,746
But this is odd.

506
00:51:35,111 --> 00:51:37,956
Ji Eun, I just had one question.

507
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:40,425
Well...

508
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,606
I'm sure remembering it would be tough on you.

509
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:56,876
Jong Woo said that he killed Seo Mun Jo on the fourth floor.

510
00:51:57,631 --> 00:51:59,416
I was wondering...

511
00:52:00,901 --> 00:52:04,546
if you saw it or remembered anything about it.

512
00:52:06,111 --> 00:52:08,285
I don't remember it that well.

513
00:52:11,111 --> 00:52:12,796
Jong Woo...

514
00:52:13,321 --> 00:52:15,526
was mumbling something to himself.

515
00:52:15,651 --> 00:52:17,726
What did he say?

516
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:31,976
No.

517
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:41,885
Please don't kill me.

518
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:44,956
Save me.

519
00:52:48,891 --> 00:52:49,966
It wasn't me.

520
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:51,765
It wasn't me!

521
00:52:54,290 --> 00:52:55,506
You just die.

522
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:01,435
Sorry. I don't remember.

523
00:53:03,571 --> 00:53:04,646
Okay.

524
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,316
I was worried to hear you wouldn't see anyone.

525
00:53:09,741 --> 00:53:11,685
It's good to see you.

526
00:53:14,681 --> 00:53:15,926
What will happen now?

527
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:18,356
Oh, that?

528
00:53:19,181 --> 00:53:22,495
On the 4th floor and basement of the studio building,

529
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:25,466
they found a lot of blood belonging to the missing persons.

530
00:53:25,590 --> 00:53:26,696
So,

531
00:53:27,391 --> 00:53:29,130
the police are sure they did it,

532
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:32,575
so they'll say it was self defense on your part.

533
00:53:32,630 --> 00:53:34,201
We have Ahn Hee Joong's statement,

534
00:53:34,201 --> 00:53:37,006
so I don't think you need to worry.

535
00:53:37,831 --> 00:53:39,515
- Those children. - What?

536
00:53:41,371 --> 00:53:42,546
What will happen to them?

537
00:53:45,310 --> 00:53:47,716
- It's okay. - Go on your own.

538
00:53:49,551 --> 00:53:50,785
They're so sweet.

539
00:53:51,511 --> 00:53:52,626
Gosh.

540
00:53:54,321 --> 00:53:55,495
What do you think...

541
00:53:57,020 --> 00:53:59,736
is good and what is bad?

542
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:03,736
What? Well...

543
00:54:06,761 --> 00:54:07,876
I'm not sure.

544
00:54:11,031 --> 00:54:13,915
I should go and work on my novel.

545
00:54:15,371 --> 00:54:17,986
Okay. I hope you recover soon.

546
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:20,115
Don't worry too much.

547
00:54:20,210 --> 00:54:24,086
There's one last thing I'd like to ask you.

548
00:54:26,121 --> 00:54:27,656
That night at the studio.

549
00:54:30,790 --> 00:54:32,896
What really happened?

550
00:54:35,161 --> 00:54:36,365
The people there.

551
00:54:37,031 --> 00:54:38,531
Did Seo Mun Jo kill them all?

552
00:54:38,531 --> 00:54:41,805
Yes. Eom Bok Soon killed Hong Nam Bok,

553
00:54:41,931 --> 00:54:44,975
and Seo Mun Jo killed Eom Bok Soon and Byun Deuk Jong.

554
00:54:46,571 --> 00:54:48,245
- Ms. Soh. - Yes?

555
00:54:48,571 --> 00:54:52,185
You said that you saw Eom Bok Soon killing Hong Nam Bok.

556
00:54:53,511 --> 00:54:56,955
Yes, I was passed out that time, but I heard the noise.

557
00:54:57,781 --> 00:54:59,526
But this is odd.

558
00:55:00,221 --> 00:55:03,095
It's different from the murder at the vacation rental house.

559
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:07,135
In that case, the suspect was an expert.

560
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:09,805
It was as if he enjoyed the act.

561
00:55:10,161 --> 00:55:12,475
Everything was done clean and meticulously.

562
00:55:13,201 --> 00:55:16,606
It's different this time. This guy's more of an amateur.

563
00:55:17,170 --> 00:55:19,716
He kept on stabbing and hitting the dead.

564
00:55:22,071 --> 00:55:23,915
It looks like one person did it.

565
00:55:24,770 --> 00:55:26,156
The people there.

566
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:29,210
Did Seo Mun Jo kill them all?

567
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:31,325
I think I should go now.

568
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:33,926
What? Okay.

569
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:55,685
(The Metamorphosis)

570
00:56:30,940 --> 00:56:33,685
Jong Woo. I have something for you.

571
00:56:34,210 --> 00:56:36,011
I found it on the 4th floor.

572
00:56:36,011 --> 00:56:38,055
It had your name on it. Here it is.

573
00:56:39,621 --> 00:56:41,426
(The Metamorphosis, Franz Kafka)

574
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:50,566
When Eom Bok Soon killed Hong Nam Bok, you saw it, right?

575
00:56:50,790 --> 00:56:55,006
I was passed out at the time, but I heard noises.

576
00:57:05,071 --> 00:57:08,656
The people there. Did Seo Mun Jo kill them all?

577
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,225
That's odd.

578
00:57:11,411 --> 00:57:12,825
This guy's more of an amateur.

579
00:57:17,051 --> 00:57:19,566
He kept on stabbing and hitting the dead.

580
00:57:20,821 --> 00:57:22,406
It wasn't clean.

581
00:57:27,661 --> 00:57:29,475
It looks like one person did it.

582
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,055
You people...

583
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:41,480
aren't worth living.

584
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:44,555
We should've killed you sooner.

585
00:57:47,721 --> 00:57:50,626
Kill all those fools.

586
00:57:50,750 --> 00:57:52,466
Go to hell.

587
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,265
You catch on...

588
00:57:55,161 --> 00:57:57,935
too quickly.

589
00:57:58,031 --> 00:58:00,006
I'm not quick-witted.

590
00:58:00,601 --> 00:58:02,031
You're just stupid.

591
00:58:02,031 --> 00:58:04,345
Die! Die!

592
00:58:04,931 --> 00:58:06,716
Die!

593
00:58:30,531 --> 00:58:32,736
Honey, now you and I...

594
00:58:35,031 --> 00:58:37,946
will be together forever.

595
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:40,546
I will make sure you die a most painful death.

596
00:58:41,741 --> 00:58:43,086
You devil.

597
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:45,316
You are...

598
00:58:46,681 --> 00:58:47,955
the best masterpiece...

599
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:51,026
I ever created.

600
00:59:18,710 --> 00:59:20,785
Something's weird. Why did he do it?

601
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,196
He must've hated them.

602
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:31,095
Strong resentment does that.

603
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:33,765
- Right? - Yes.

604
00:59:34,090 --> 00:59:36,305
- How much must he have hated them? - I guess.

605
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:42,966
I'll let you live.

606
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,075
But...

607
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:49,376
kill everyone else outside.

608
01:00:57,310 --> 01:00:58,885
I'll kill them all.

609
01:01:03,011 --> 01:01:04,725
I'll kill you all.

610
01:01:07,821 --> 01:01:09,426
I'll kill everyone.

611
01:01:17,891 --> 01:01:22,230
(Die die die die die die die)

612
01:01:22,230 --> 01:01:24,606
Die. Die.

613
01:01:25,101 --> 01:01:28,446
Die! Die!

614
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,446
You had fun too.

615
01:01:31,511 --> 01:01:33,415
When you killed everyone here.

616
01:01:35,141 --> 01:01:36,256
Didn't you?

617
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:47,736
What...

618
01:01:57,931 --> 01:01:59,106
You are...

619
01:01:59,540 --> 01:02:01,446
the best masterpiece I ever created.

620
01:02:03,110 --> 01:02:04,245
Please don't kill me.

621
01:02:06,011 --> 01:02:07,455
Save me.

622
01:02:07,980 --> 01:02:10,126
Honey, now you and I...

623
01:02:12,511 --> 01:02:15,396
will be together forever.

624
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:19,566
It wasn't me.

625
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:21,495
It wasn't me!

626
01:02:26,931 --> 01:02:31,705
(Investigation Underway)

627
01:03:03,201 --> 01:03:04,406
Honey.
