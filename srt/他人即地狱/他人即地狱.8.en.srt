00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:09,384
NO OUTSIDE VISITORS
ALLOWED IN THE RESIDENCE

2
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,378
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS

3
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,381
AND INCIDENTS APPEARING
IN THIS FILM ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:08,735
Are you okay?

5
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,416
Goodness, you're bleeding.

6
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,258
Don't say anything. You're badly hurt.

7
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,682
Don't worry now.

8
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,018
I'm by your side.

9
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,121
Are you leaving this early to work?

10
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,832
What?

11
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,793
You moved in yesterday, didn't you?

12
00:02:08,711 --> 00:02:11,005
I live right next door.

13
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,757
I see.

14
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:27,021
Are you finally awake?

15
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:33,319
I'm not done stitching, so hold still.

16
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,159
Your tongue will get cut off
if you keep moving.

17
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,787
Don't worry.

18
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,540
I'm stitching you up
because you bled too much in your mouth.

19
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,709
All done.

20
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,631
Why are you doing this to me?

21
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,634
What are you?

22
00:02:57,635 --> 00:03:00,179
What do you think I am, babe?

23
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,727
A dentist who lives at a residence?

24
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,438
Or

25
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:12,108
a serial killer you'd find
in a crime novel?

26
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,405
Well, it doesn't matter.

27
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:22,327
I can be anything you want.

28
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:24,954
What do you want from me?

29
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:28,041
Don't take this the wrong way,

30
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,835
but I overheard you talking
on the phone last night.

31
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:35,048
It must be really frustrating
to have your friend betray you

32
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,674
and to lose your entire family.

33
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,092
You asshole.

34
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:41,930
As you know,
the walls separate these rooms,

35
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:44,265
but you can almost hear
your neighbor breathing.

36
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:46,893
What are you?

37
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:56,611
Your eyes are just like mine.

38
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,113
That's why I know you very well.

39
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:03,201
I do something similar too.

40
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,079
I break things up,

41
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:07,664
put them together,

42
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,416
and recreate.

43
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,390
Don't you worry.

44
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,183
Babe,

45
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:31,271
I'll turn you into a new man.

46
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,326
Are you having fun playing around with me?

47
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,206
I promise you.

48
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,751
You'll become just as special as me.

49
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:56,838
I'll make that happen.

50
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:06,347
Jeong-hwa, what are you watching?

51
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,310
The security camera
right in front of Eden Residence.

52
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,227
What?

53
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,105
I thought there was
no security camera around that place.

54
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,858
How did you get your hands on that?

55
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,194
Thankfully, there was one
at the entrance of the grocery store.

56
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,614
I fixed the owner's fan this morning.

57
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,367
You're really something.

58
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,705
Right, how's your father?

59
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:34,125
Do you know him?

60
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,171
-I heard from Captain...
-Yes?

61
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,340
...that your father was
the chief investigator

62
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,719
of the TV show,  Investigation 24 .

63
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,138
I really loved that show.

64
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,850
Let me destroy your fantasy.

65
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:55,188
That's less than ten percent of who he is.
They created that character for him.

66
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,524
What was that? The lonely chief?
He's way far from solitude.

67
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:00,985
Wait, then

68
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,697
what about everything he said?

69
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,784
Like, "If you get suspicious,
get your hands dirty"?

70
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,327
Was that the writer?

71
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,079
"If you get suspicious,
get your hands dirty"?

72
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,246
He doesn't say that.

73
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,290
Gosh.

74
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,752
I really loved that quote.

75
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:24,425
Officer Cho, let's make a U-turn.

76
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,426
Pardon?

77
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:29,013
"If you get suspicious,
get your hands dirty." U-turn.

78
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:49,325
We got here now,
but what are you going to do?

79
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:52,161
This is the most suspicious place for me.

80
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,251
What are you suspecting?

81
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:05,216
Detective Cha Seong-ryeol's car was headed
to the residence,

82
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:09,679
and he was caught on camera
of the grocery store around 11:00 p.m.

83
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:13,099
He left the residence at 11:30 p.m.

84
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:17,228
Then his car was caught leaving
on the same camera

85
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,732
at 12:00 a.m.
And it's that. That really bothers me.

86
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:25,486
-Yes, that does sound odd.
-It's weird. Very weird.

87
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,116
Where was he and what was he doing
for those 30 minutes?

88
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:35,204
Then if we look into those 30 minutes,

89
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,457
we might find some leads.

90
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,833
I guess so.

91
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:42,795
But no one is looking
for those 30 minutes.

92
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,465
Even though an incumbent detective
suddenly went out of reach

93
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:47,592
for absolutely no reason at all.

94
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:49,886
Why do you think that is?

95
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:51,387
Because it's none of their business.

96
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,266
People don't want to waste a second
on something that isn't their business.

97
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,185
But we're police officers.

98
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,353
Yes, right. We are.

99
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,190
Okay.

100
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:07,945
I'm sure Detective Cha Seong-ryeol
parked inside

101
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,156
like these cars.

102
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,409
What do we have to look for, then?

103
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:20,583
Let's say that he parked right there.

104
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,461
POLICE

105
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:33,012
Where are you, Hui-jung?

106
00:08:43,397 --> 00:08:45,358
If something had happened

107
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:49,570
to Detective Cha Seong-ryeol
within those 30 minutes...

108
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,499
If it had rained, the water
would've been drained to one place.

109
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,219
There's nothing here.

110
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:21,018
There was another drain over there.

111
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,144
What?

112
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,108
Jeong-hwa, there's nothing over there.

113
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:29,735
"If you get suspicious,
get your hands dirty." Go.

114
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:31,821
-Come on, Jeong-hwa.
-Hyeon-ho.

115
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,790
Do you see anything?

116
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:46,961
Darn it.

117
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,632
-Hey.
-What?

118
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,801
-Go.
-Come on.

119
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,220
"If you get suspicious,
get your hands dirty."

120
00:09:56,304 --> 00:09:58,472
That's not the problem. I can't lift this.

121
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,558
We need to call a crane to lift this.

122
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:03,227
"If you get suspicious,
get your hands dirty."

123
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,021
How am I supposed to lift this?

124
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,274
Jeong-hwa, do you have to go this far?

125
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,570
-That was freaking heavy.
-Hey.

126
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:18,909
Why is there a needle here?

127
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,424
It's a bit out of place
to find a syringe here.

128
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,555
POLICE

129
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,937
-Hey, where is it?
-Ma'am, it's this place.

130
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,314
-Really?
-Yes.

131
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,149
-Isn't it the first floor?
-The second.

132
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,609
-The second floor? Are you sure?
-Yes.

133
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:53,653
-Let's go.
-I know this place.

134
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,739
What are you doing?
You have to arrest him.

135
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,032
What are you doing?

136
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:04,664
-What's this mess?
-What's going on?

137
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,084
No idea. He needs to say something.
It's not like we can beat him up.

138
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,210
-He did it first.
-Jeong-hwa.

139
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,128
-Yes?
-He wouldn't talk.

140
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:16,133
Jong-u, is it true
that you assaulted those kids first?

141
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,261
Are you all right?

142
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:24,850
-I could just kill him right now.
-He's putting on a show.

143
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,228
-Have some water.
-Hey, don't try to get out of this

144
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:28,813
by using your mental illness as an excuse.

145
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,315
Why did you hit them
when they didn't do anything? Say it.

146
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:34,402
The reason isn't important.
My kid is hospitalized.

147
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:37,321
It'll take eight weeks for him to recover,
and he needs counseling.

148
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,032
-What are we going to do?
-We'll do the investigation. Calm down.

149
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,743
Investigate what? There's nothing
to investigate. My son got hurt.

150
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,955
-Our kids got hurt!
-Why are you telling us to keep quiet?

151
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:49,375
Hey, you should just work things out.

152
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,294
-Just tell them you're sorry.
-Our children are hurt!

153
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,005
There's nothing to investigate.
Our children were hurt!

154
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:57,842
-My kid was beaten up!
-I'm going to report him, okay?

155
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,593
-Please sit and wait.
-I can't believe this.

156
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:03,097
We should never settle this case
for a thug like him.

157
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,849
Are you sure you won't settle?

158
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,767
He needs to apologize first!

159
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,561
Who do you think you are to tell us that?

160
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,646
-Who do you think you are?
-Unbelievable!

161
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,940
-I can't believe this.
-Who is this anyway?

162
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,860
If you settle the case now,
I'll give you as much as you want.

163
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:18,112
Are you sure you won't make a settlement?

164
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,698
-Well, I...
-Well...

165
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,032
What's he saying?

166
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,410
What was that?

167
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,787
-Well.
-Excuse me.

168
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,501
Goodness, sir.

169
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:37,006
Thank you so much
for settling the case smoothly.

170
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,174
-Sure.
-Thank you.

171
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,344
Sir, you won't find anyone like him
in this world.

172
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:45,014
Consider him your savior for life, okay?

173
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,433
Goodness, I'm hardly a savior.
We should always help each other.

174
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,435
I knew it, Dr. Seo.

175
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,312
You're an angel without wings.

176
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:54,607
Thank you, Dr. Seo.
I'll meet you next week for the volunteer.

177
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:57,193
-See you then.
-Please go home safely. Goodbye.

178
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:59,278
-Please.
-Sure.

179
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,743
Jong-u.

180
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,412
Here. Your ID.

181
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:18,047
Call me immediately if anything happens.

182
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,299
Make sure you do.

183
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:44,990
What are you doing over there?

184
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:50,246
I have no idea
what you're trying to do here,

185
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:52,873
but I have nothing to do with that,
and I don't care.

186
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:55,209
I'm going to move out tomorrow
and never come back here.

187
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,712
I'll make sure I pay you back
for the settlement.

188
00:13:58,796 --> 00:13:59,630
So please,

189
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,758
I ask of you.

190
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:07,221
Will you please leave me alone? I beg you.

191
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:13,060
Adam's apple. This is called the uvula.

192
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,186
What?

193
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,357
These muscles and the uvula

194
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,903
hidden inside your neck.

195
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:25,322
I love looking into this area.

196
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:34,164
Don't ever hide anything from me again.

197
00:14:35,749 --> 00:14:36,834
Do you understand?

198
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,049
No.

199
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:53,684
OFFICER SO JEONG-HWA

200
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,770
Yes, hello?

201
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,064
Hello, I'm Officer So Jeong-hwa

202
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:02,067
of Eunhye Patrol Division,
and I've called you recently.

203
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:03,319
"Eunhye Patrol Division"?

204
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:06,488
Yes, I had a talk
with your division before.

205
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,616
I was wondering

206
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,911
if you reached
Detective Cha Seong-ryeol yet.

207
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:15,581
We haven't been able to reach him either,
so we've been looking for him too.

208
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:16,665
What's this regarding?

209
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,876
So you can't reach him either.

210
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,712
Well...

211
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,841
I think that there could be a possibility

212
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,676
that Detective Cha

213
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,304
was abducted

214
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:34,058
or a possibility that he was murdered.

215
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,935
What?

216
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:39,897
I found a piece of evidence
around Eunhye-dong,

217
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,691
where Detective Cha last came by.

218
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:47,112
Evidence? He was at Eunhye-dong,

219
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,864
then he disappeared at Mount Changeui.

220
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:51,450
"Mount Changeui"?

221
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,120
Yes, he was last seen on security footage
around midnight at that place.

222
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,081
I see, around midnight.

223
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,749
-Hey, give me the phone.
-Yes, sir.

224
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,545
Hello? Is this Eunhye Patrol Division?
It's Lee Gwang-jae. We spoke before.

225
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,549
Yes, hello, I'm Officer So Jeong-hwa
of Eunhye Patrol Division.

226
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,927
Yes, so evidence? What evidence?

227
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,054
I found a syringe.

228
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:15,307
I thought there's a possibility

229
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:18,143
that it was used against Detective Cha.

230
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,312
-So I--
-"A syringe"? Where did you find that?

231
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,648
It was around Eunhye-dong,

232
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:26,193
where his car had been parked.

233
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:30,155
I picked it up from the ground,
and I thought it could've been used.

234
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,700
How did you confirm
his car was parked there?

235
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,828
I checked with security footage.
But that's not what's important.

236
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:39,039
The people at that residence are

237
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:42,418
very suspicious,
and they seem to be related...

238
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,754
Are you sure that syringe was used
against Detective Cha?

239
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,965
No, I'm not 100 percent sure.

240
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,553
So you picked up that syringe

241
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,762
as evidence?

242
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,391
What should we do now? Goodness.

243
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,851
That syringe.

244
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:03,647
Then I'm so sorry to ask,
but I'll send this to you.

245
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:07,484
Can you run some tests and check
in case we find anything?

246
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:11,071
In that case,
we'll check and call you back.

247
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,615
Okay, then. Please give me a call.

248
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:36,346
You can go first.
I'll smoke a cigarette before I go in.

249
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:42,936
It's now.

250
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,731
I need to grab this chance to run away.

251
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,820
Jong-u.

252
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:56,116
Jong-u, I smelled something weird
while I passed by the fourth floor.

253
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:59,953
I kept thinking about what that smell was,
and it's the smell of blood.

254
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:02,247
So I wondered why I smelled blood...

255
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,416
What's with your face?

256
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:09,004
-I fell.
-What happened?

257
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:47,042
Jong-u, if you're okay,
do you want to grab a beer?

258
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:48,335
No.

259
00:18:49,878 --> 00:18:51,046
-What?
-I'm going to sleep.

260
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:53,882
Okay.

261
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,759
Goodnight, then.

262
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,733
What's wrong?

263
00:19:13,318 --> 00:19:15,737
A dead... A dead cat.

264
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,327
Jong-u, this is...

265
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,789
This is just your shirt.

266
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,793
What's wrong? Why did you suddenly scream?

267
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:32,629
You shocked me to death.

268
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,758
We're sorry. He saw something wrong.

269
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,136
Why? Sir.

270
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:45,017
Did you see a dead cat or something?

271
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:50,564
-You... You're low on energy.
-Hey. Jong-u.

272
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:54,151
-You should take some herbal tonic.
-Jong-u.

273
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,571
Jong-u.

274
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,573
Are you all right, Jong-u?

275
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,242
Are you all right? Jong-u!

276
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,960
Did you see those people's eyes?

277
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,671
You never know
what guys like them will end up doing.

278
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,008
Stop showing off, you jerk!

279
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:20,219
-Get down.
-I'll kill you right away.

280
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,804
Did you think we did something bad?

281
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,974
Then you can just move out!
Why do you live here like this?

282
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,728
It's better to say what you want
and do what you want to do.

283
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,605
That's more human.

284
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,840
Hello, sir.

285
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,804
I'm Constable So Jeong-hwa
of Eunhye Patrol Division.

286
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:07,432
I wanted to ask you about
your security camera. Please cooperate.

287
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,767
Sure, go ahead.

288
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:14,815
As you can see, we have five cameras,

289
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:16,525
but only two of them can record.

290
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,945
There isn't a lot of traffic,

291
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:22,739
so the footage is mostly like this.

292
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,866
-It's always like this?
-Mostly, yes.

293
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:29,538
It's pretty desolate,
so it's always the same.

294
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,835
See that?
That's the footage from yesterday.

295
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:37,045
There's barely anyone coming or going.

296
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:39,464
There's nothing to see here.

297
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,428
-Hey. Wait, sir. One second.
-What? Okay.

298
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:50,684
This road leads up, doesn't it?

299
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:53,687
-Yes.
-What's up there in this mountain?

300
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,148
Just trees. Nothing but trees.

301
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:57,357
-Really?
-Yes.

302
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:00,152
Then where's the exit?
Where does this road lead to?

303
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,571
Is there another exit
after it goes through this mountain?

304
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:06,867
I think that's the only way up and down.

305
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,535
-Nothing else.
-This is the only road?

306
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:09,661
You're right.

307
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,374
You won't find anything else here.

308
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,129
I didn't see him coming back down.

309
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:21,715
There's nothing here.

310
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,259
Then where is he?

311
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,656
Who... Who destroyed my keyboard?

312
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:49,201
Intern, you did this, didn't you?

313
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:51,953
I'm asking you!

314
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,794
It's seriously difficult to work

315
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,087
with an idiot.

316
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:02,339
Damn it.

317
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:06,802
My keyboard. I have a lot to do today too.

318
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,262
Damn it, he broke my keyboard.

319
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:11,681
What am I supposed to do now?

320
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,106
I have to send something too.

321
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:22,025
Damn it, but my keyboard is broken.

322
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:24,528
How am I supposed to work? Damn it.

323
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,103
-Jong-u. Jong-u!
-What are you doing?

324
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:01,273
-Jong-u!
-Jong-u, stop it!

325
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,608
Hey, you idiot! Are you insane?

326
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,778
-What are you doing?
-Byeong-min, are you okay?

327
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:08,029
Byeong-min, are you okay?

328
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,365
Are you out of your mind?

329
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,410
Byeong-min. Byeong-min?

330
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,539
Yes, who is it?

331
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:22,085
I thought you were a different man
when you went crazy just now.

332
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:25,463
Sang-man just called.

333
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,633
Thankfully, Byeong-min isn't badly hurt.
Thanks.

334
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,927
But he has to be hospitalized
for a few weeks.

335
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:35,640
I'll try to make sure he doesn't sue you,
but I'm not sure how it'll go.

336
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,767
It's not like you hit him once or twice.

337
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:39,728
Why did you do that?

338
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,980
You weren't like this before.

339
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,276
-Then what was I like before?
-What?

340
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:51,198
Forget it. I'm all done with you.

341
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,534
What's with your face?

342
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,830
I don't think you got hurt just now.
And look at your shirt.

343
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,875
I fell down the stairs.

344
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,711
You can't get hurt like that
from falling down the stairs.

345
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,713
What has gotten into you lately?

346
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,590
I heard you argued with Ji-eun too.

347
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,180
What's with that face?

348
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,224
Why did you

349
00:25:18,892 --> 00:25:20,227
meet with Ji-eun?

350
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:22,646
What?

351
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,815
Did you think I wouldn't know?

352
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:33,281
If you don't want to die, behave properly.

353
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,921
I was starting to lose self-control.

354
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,800
What's changing me like this?

355
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:55,303
People at the residence? People at work?

356
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,931
Or is this who I really am?

357
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,519
I no longer have any idea

358
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,479
what I'm truly like.

359
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:12,153
Ouch, that hurts. Don't touch me.

360
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,572
-What about your arm?
-My arm hurts too. Right here.

361
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:15,907
-You're here.
-Goodness.

362
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:19,202
-Mom...
-My goodness.

363
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,496
My goodness, what happened to you?

364
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,664
Where did you hurt?

365
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,667
-Ouch, that hurts. My arm.
-Are you badly hurt? Does that hurt a lot?

366
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,877
Look, I'm on my third IV.

367
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:32,132
My goodness, what will you do now?
You poor thing.

368
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,502
I should've just killed him.

369
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,773
Hello, this is Eunhye Patrol Division...

370
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,571
Is something going on?

371
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,365
What? No.

372
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:03,223
Yes, hello? Auntie Gyeong-hui.
It has been forever, hasn't it?

373
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,933
It's me, Jeong-hwa.

374
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:08,019
Yes, actually,

375
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,980
I wanted to ask you for a favor.

376
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,402
Captain, let me cool you down.

377
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,570
What is it?

378
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,657
I was wondering if I could

379
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,910
take the rest of the day off.

380
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:25,120
What are you going to do?

381
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:28,748
It's actually personal,
so I can't really tell you.

382
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:31,626
Hey, why? Are you going to BTS's concert?

383
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:35,588
Hey, my nephew has been busy
since this morning to go there.

384
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,966
-Man.
-That's when I'll take the whole day off.

385
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,760
Anyway, I take that as a yes,

386
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:44,180
and I will take off now. Thank you.

387
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,807
I will see you tomorrow.

388
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:48,977
-Hey, Jeong-hwa.
-Yes? Thank you.

389
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,563
You can't leave whenever you want.

390
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,148
Hey, give me that syringe.

391
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,399
Oh, yes.

392
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,277
Right here.

393
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,029
I didn't find any fingerprints.
I guess they had gloves on.

394
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:02,907
But I found DNA on the syringe.

395
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,868
-DNA?
-Yes.

396
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:07,620
I don't think it's Detective Cha's DNA.
Take a seat.

397
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,621
Okay.

398
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,123
I'm not completely sure,

399
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:13,835
but the drug in that syringe is a type
of anesthetic called articaine.

400
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,045
-Artica...
-Yes, articaine.

401
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,714
-Articaine.
-It's local anesthetic

402
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,049
usually used at a dentist's office.

403
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:23,636
But this drug kicks in
much faster than other drugs.

404
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,181
Jeong-hwa.

405
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,308
Yes? Yes.

406
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:31,144
If anyone up above finds out,
you'll be disciplined.

407
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,687
I know that.

408
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,648
Why are you taking this so far?

409
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,569
-Auntie.
-Yes?

410
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:43,948
Will you believe
everything I tell you now?

411
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,160
-Try me.
-Okay.

412
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,829
Well, okay.

413
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:55,126
At first, it was cats.

414
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:02,133
-It's that again?
-Cats began to die once every two days.

415
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,135
I started feeling that it was similar

416
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,388
to the pension murder case
from three months ago.

417
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,307
And then

418
00:30:09,849 --> 00:30:12,352
this foreign worker went missing.

419
00:30:12,435 --> 00:30:16,022
Was anybody else reported as missing
other than that man?

420
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:20,610
Did someone else go missing
from that residence?

421
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,948
The landlord told me
that the man moved out,

422
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:27,575
but it was weird how he suddenly left,
and he didn't seem like a type...

423
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:32,288
And that man lived in the same residence
as the man who had been killing the cats.

424
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,625
After that, Detective Cha Seong-ryeol
went missing at that residence,

425
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:39,462
and another man went missing as well,
so a total of two people are missing.

426
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:44,175
Are you suspecting this was done
by that man who killed the cats?

427
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,970
At first, I thought that was the case.

428
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:50,598
But as I looked into that residence,
I found way too many weird things.

429
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:54,602
The landlord of that residence
used to run an orphanage,

430
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,230
but a fire broke out,
so she took the insurance money

431
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,023
and had disappeared.

432
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,401
Three people who lived at that orphanage

433
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:05,321
are currently living together
at that residence.

434
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,825
-All together? That's odd.
-Right?

435
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:14,080
Then do you think
this wasn't a one-man crime?

436
00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,164
Yes.

437
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,834
If we don't stop this,

438
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,587
I think someone else might die.

439
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,756
I don't think you can stop this.

440
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,634
Why don't you hand it over to a detective?

441
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,970
We have no time.

442
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:31,890
I have to stop them before it happens.

443
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,692
Mom, not chocolate...

444
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,320
-Byeong-min.
-Reporter Cho. What brings you here?

445
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,487
-I was passing by.
-A reporter?

446
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,281
-Yes, hello. You must be his mother.
-Hi.

447
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:51,451
Goodness, Mr. Reporter,
you need to punish that jerk.

448
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:54,162
-Mom, come on.
-Stay quiet.

449
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:56,414
He was always bullied by bad guys

450
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,958
back when he was in school too.

451
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,210
He's such a kind and gentle kid.

452
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,297
Goodness, he should learn
to hit them back when he's beaten.

453
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,590
He's way too nice.

454
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,926
-He's way too nice. Gosh, those jerks.
-Goodness.

455
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:11,262
-Anyway, Mr. Reporter. You two can talk.
-Okay.

456
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,972
-I'll be back soon.
-Mom... Not chocolate.

457
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,766
I want strawberry flavor.

458
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,476
-Okay, okay.
-I'll see you.

459
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:20,647
Strawberry, my ass.

460
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,106
Drink this.

461
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:24,651
You must be busy. Why did you come?

462
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:28,321
Don't say that.
I should come no matter how busy I am.

463
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,739
How are you feeling?

464
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:33,868
I got stitches here
and I have signs of concussion too.

465
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,579
Anyway, did that intern really do this
to you?

466
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:40,208
That asshole is a psycho.

467
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,043
Tell me more.

468
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:46,089
He... He beat me up in the office,
and if Mr. Shin hadn't stopped him,

469
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,341
I really would've died.

470
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,635
I... I didn't even do anything.

471
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:53,054
-Could you open this? My hands hurt.
-Okay.

472
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:56,391
He kept beating me up.

473
00:32:56,683 --> 00:33:00,687
You should've seen that asshole's face.

474
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,106
It... It was really frightening.

475
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,192
Man, I didn't think he was like that.

476
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:07,777
Darn it.

477
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:09,862
Mr. Shin, where are you?

478
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,699
You're seeing the intern?

479
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,785
Can we meet tonight after you see him?

480
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,413
Okay, I'll wait at the office.

481
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:19,372
Yes.

482
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,711
Man, something doesn't feel right.

483
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,386
Jong-u.

484
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,388
Yoon Jong-u.

485
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,269
You left ages ago.
Why are you coming home so late?

486
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,857
How did you know I live here?

487
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,360
I asked Ji-eun, obviously.

488
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,697
Let's grab a drink.

489
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,200
-We need to clear up the misunderstanding.
-What misunderstanding?

490
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,327
Meeting your junior's girlfriend
behind his back?

491
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:01,164
It's not like that.

492
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:05,752
Ji-eun was way too worried about you,
so I was telling her not to worry.

493
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,963
And she said your pride will be hurt,
so she asked me not to tell you.

494
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,089
Why are you

495
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,300
so selfish?

496
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,552
You're really self-centered.

497
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,054
Come with me.

498
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,306
Is there a pub around here?

499
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,062
Here.

500
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:28,816
Hey.

501
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,069
You should get changed.

502
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:44,624
Jong-u.

503
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,417
What has gotten into you lately?

504
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,629
You suddenly got into a fight.

505
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,672
And... My gosh.

506
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,800
Why did you destroy Helmet's keyboard?

507
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,510
Why?

508
00:34:57,220 --> 00:35:00,348
Jong-u, tell me. What's the problem?

509
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,476
You'll run into

510
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:06,104
many people like Helmet

511
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,357
out in the real world.

512
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:12,777
You can't work
with only the people you like.

513
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,531
Well, I know things have been tough
ever since you moved to Seoul.

514
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,659
But you'll end up dying early if you
get bothered with every little thing.

515
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,703
Will you give up on everything
because a few idiots are bothering you?

516
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:25,123
Doesn't that feel like losing?
Doesn't it hurt your pride?

517
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:29,377
I'm sure you had a plan
when you first came to Seoul.

518
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:35,216
I'm only telling you this because
you're like a real brother. Others...

519
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,634
Ji-eun, over here.

520
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,597
I called her. It seemed like you had
a big misunderstanding.

521
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,182
-Jae-ho.
-Grab a seat.

522
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:44,308
Ji-eun.

523
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,272
What happened?
I heard you fought with someone at work.

524
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:53,776
Hey, your boyfriend has
the narrowest mind on earth.

525
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,486
-Let me see.
-He wouldn't listen to me.

526
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,404
Hey.

527
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,991
Do you really want to die?

528
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,284
Jong-u.

529
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:05,413
Jong-u.

530
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,207
You shouldn't

531
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,835
make a mistake
when your temper has a hold of you.

532
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:14,380
I know things are tough as you live
in a residence, but don't talk like that.

533
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:17,758
Things aren't just tough for you.
It's tough for everyone. Stop whining.

534
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,135
What do you know?

535
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,472
You were born with a silver spoon
in your mouth. What do you know?

536
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:26,017
I can't believe
this jerk's inferiority complex.

537
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,897
You're anxious I might take Ji-eun
because I'm way better than you.

538
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,524
Stop it, Jae-ho. Jong-u!

539
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,568
-What? Are you going to hit me with that?
-Jong-u.

540
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,528
-Hey, go ahead.
-Jong-u. Jong-u, please!

541
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,865
-Wait.
-Hit me. Let him go. Ji-eun, let him go.

542
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:43,034
-My gosh, stop it!
-Let's see what he'll do.

543
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:58,966
It's you, room 303.

544
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,552
Hello.

545
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,889
I live in the same building as Jong-u.

546
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,308
I come here often after work.

547
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:10,770
I was glad to run into him as I walked by.

548
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,355
Let me join you.

549
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:15,191
What are you doing? Sit down.

550
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,735
We've met before, haven't we?

551
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:21,155
I'm sorry, but we're having

552
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,866
a serious discussion right now.

553
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,577
Is he your colleague at work, Jong-u?

554
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:30,665
I'm not his colleague. I'm the CEO.

555
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:33,459
Oh, the CEO.

556
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,338
That's why your voice is so full
of yourself.

557
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,381
What?

558
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,053
You feel like you're all alone

559
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,389
when you're in that tiny little room.

560
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:51,936
But when people who are the closest
to you don't understand how you feel...

561
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,106
I'm sure you know
what that feels like, Jong-u.

562
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,943
Hey, man. What are you doing?

563
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,945
What?

564
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:05,032
Who do you think you are
to pretend to know him so well?

565
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,205
-You're disgusting.
-What?

566
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:14,292
You don't even mean it.
Don't pretend as if you care about him.

567
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,837
You're just happy to get cheap labor.

568
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:22,216
And if you end up getting her,
that's even better.

569
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,679
Who do you think you are
to say something like that?

570
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:29,265
Hey. Hey! Do you want to die?

571
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:30,766
Isn't this hilarious?

572
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:33,686
He's shouting like this
when he's in front of a woman

573
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,355
with his foreign car key,
acting like a tough guy.

574
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,898
You little asshole.

575
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:38,858
Hey,

576
00:38:39,775 --> 00:38:42,361
-I can't believe this.
-Let's talk outside in private.

577
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,989
-Okay.
-Hey. Come here.

578
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,907
-Jong-u.
-It's okay, Ji-eun. It's fine.

579
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,617
-Jong-u, wait. You, come here.
-Jae-ho.

580
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,411
-I'm just going to have a chat.
-Jae-ho.

581
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,705
-Hey, man!
-Will you please stop it?

582
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,582
Man, this is unbelievable.

583
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:58,419
Gosh, the air is wet.

584
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,339
I guess
it's almost the monsoon season. Right?

585
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,134
How did you know I was here?

586
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,928
I saw you as I was passing by.

587
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,057
You must be busy seeing your girlfriend.

588
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:13,851
I mean,

589
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,979
why on earth

590
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,815
do you follow me around like this?

591
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,610
No, it's not that.

592
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:26,155
I don't mind that. I don't care.

593
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:30,117
So please just leave us alone.

594
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,410
I ask of you.

595
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:33,996
-I can't do that.
-What?

596
00:39:35,623 --> 00:39:37,583
Haven't I told you before, babe?

597
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:40,753
Once I pick my target, I never lose them.

598
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:45,883
Hey, long hair.

599
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,138
You wanted to kill him

600
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,475
when your girlfriend got out of his car.

601
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,745
If you want to kill him, do it.

602
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,873
That's who you really are.

603
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:21,752
Hey, let's have a chat.

604
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,756
Hey, man!

605
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,593
He got scared and ran off.

606
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,180
Jong-u, are you okay?

607
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:37,268
Why did you get so scared?

608
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:40,646
He's tall, but he's way too pale,
and he looks like a weak fighter.

609
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:48,904
Maybe I shouldn't have called you.
I feel bad to see you like this.

610
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,907
You should go back to your hometown
and get some rest.

611
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,534
Call me when you feel better.

612
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,870
I'll pay you for the days you've worked.

613
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:58,706
You don't want to run into him, do you?

614
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:00,833
Don't stay at the residence.

615
00:41:01,542 --> 00:41:04,003
Go to a motel or something. Here.

616
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,381
Take it. Darn it.

617
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,340
Jae-ho.

618
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,720
-Be careful.
-What?

619
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,763
Be careful at night.

620
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,021
I can't believe
what this asshole is saying. What?

621
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,231
What are you going to do?

622
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:28,194
I felt bad for you and treated you nicely,
but what? "Be careful at night?"

623
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,613
-I can take you out with a punch.
-Jae-ho!

624
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:34,617
-What? Hit me.
-What's with you? Let him go.

625
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:37,578
Ji-eun saved you.

626
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:39,788
What's with you two?

627
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,754
I'm serious.

628
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,007
He really needs to be careful.

629
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:51,800
What?

630
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,720
He has to be careful.

631
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:01,352
The intersection of Seoul Terminal.

632
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,653
Jong-u.

633
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,951
What's going on?

634
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:21,830
Ji-eun, I'm going back home tomorrow.

635
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,879
What about your stuff? Hey.

636
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:33,884
-Isn't it all in that residence?
-I don't know. I don't know.

637
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:38,514
Is it because

638
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:42,226
of that guy
who lives at the residence with you?

639
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:48,274
Your facial expression changed
as soon as he walked in.

640
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:55,197
-Jong-u.
-Ji-eun.

641
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,618
He's a really terrifying man.

642
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:46,665
Jong-u, that ungrateful jerk.

643
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:01,555
I thought everything would end
once I leave the residence.

644
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,808
However, the location wasn't the problem.

645
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:09,104
Everywhere I went to
began to turn into hell.

646
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:42,012
Man, that crazy asshole.

647
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:53,792
I don't usually make
a spontaneous move like this,

648
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:56,670
but Jong-u is

649
00:45:57,588 --> 00:45:58,881
special to me.

650
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:02,509
Well, yes, he's special.

651
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:07,055
But why did you act up like that before?

652
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:09,850
Damn it.

653
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:13,437
Spare me...

654
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,975
JI-EUN: YES, I'M FINE
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT TOO?

655
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:04,404
I'M FINE, BUT WHERE ARE YOU TWO?

656
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,413
JAE-HO: I WANT TO SEE HIM
AND APOLOGIZE FACE-TO-FACE

657
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:28,220
NO, HE'S NOT DOING VERY GREAT TODAY,
SO LET'S MEET AGAIN LATER

658
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,230
SO LET'S MEET AGAIN LATER

659
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,492
Yes, Mr. Byun.

660
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,245
I need you to clean up this place.

661
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:12,532
Hey.

662
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,077
How are you doing at the headquarters?

663
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:18,580
What do you think?
It's an exclusive scoop.

664
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,417
If you don't want it,
I'll take it somewhere else.

665
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,296
I'm sure of this one.

666
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,632
Let's talk again tomorrow.

667
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:41,853
What is this?

668
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:43,855
Are... Are you a reporter?

669
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:47,526
Is something fun going on?

670
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,361
No... No.

671
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,656
I was just passing by. I was leaving.

672
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,119
What is it?

673
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,121
Really?

674
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:09,297
I clearly remember telling you
to clean it up.

675
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:14,803
Do you think I'm here
to clean up after your mess?

676
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,104
This is the problem.

677
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:29,025
You aren't enjoying this situation at all.

678
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,610
You're scared, aren't you?

679
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:37,325
Just do as I say, Mr. Byun.

680
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,537
That's the only way you can live here.

681
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:47,669
Yes. I... I was just joking.

682
00:51:09,816 --> 00:51:11,193
YOON JONG-U

683
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:14,446
THE METAMORPHOSIS  BY FRANZ KAFKA

684
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,079
What are you up to?

685
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:27,709
Oh, hello. I got a little hungry.

686
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,378
Jong-u let me borrow this.

687
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:33,465
Oh, I see. I get it.

688
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:37,511
Do you want to grab a drink together?
I was bored all alone.

689
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,429
Okay, sounds great to me.

690
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:40,680
-Grab a seat.
-Okay.

691
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:48,688
-Oh, one second.
-Sure.

692
00:52:00,575 --> 00:52:02,869
-What is this?
-Meat.

693
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:06,373
It must be  yukhoe .

694
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,459
The landlord makes it for us
from time to time.

695
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,711
Wow, she's really generous.

696
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,672
At the residence I used to live,

697
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:16,216
they didn't even let us eat enough rice
to save money.

698
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,219
Try some.

699
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:20,554
Okay.

700
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,519
-Gosh, thank you.
-Sure.

701
00:52:35,193 --> 00:52:37,320
So? Do you like it?

702
00:52:39,155 --> 00:52:39,990
Yes.

703
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,659
It seems a little tough,

704
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,203
yet it's very tender.

705
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:49,833
What is this meat?
I don't think I've ever had it.

706
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:54,254
To be honest, I have no idea.
I just eat whatever she makes.

707
00:52:54,337 --> 00:52:56,965
Right? I'm just grateful
that she gives this to us.

708
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,593
It's seasoned differently too.

709
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:01,928
Isn't it usually seasoned with sesame oil?

710
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:07,183
Young man in room 310, you eat very well.

711
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,268
Yes.

712
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,275
That's human meat.

713
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,575
I'm just joking. Were you shocked?

714
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,035
Right?

715
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:32,334
-Grab a drink.
-Gosh. You really shocked me.

716
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,422
-It looked like...
-Yes?

717
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:41,676
...you became close to room 303.
Is it because you're about the same age?

718
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,471
Yes, Jong-u is a great guy.

719
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:48,183
But it seemed like people
in the residence bullied him.

720
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:55,231
It's okay. Tell me.

721
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:58,443
It's okay.

722
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:03,365
He said everyone
at this residence is weird, didn't he?

723
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:04,866
You knew that?

724
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:09,621
At first, I also thought people here
were weird, and I didn't like them either.

725
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:14,167
But I learned to get along now.
Not everyone can be the same.

726
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:18,421
I felt better once I established
that they're just different.

727
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:23,176
Come to hear about it, you're right.

728
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:25,428
Mun-jo, right...

729
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:27,597
May I call you by your name?

730
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:30,141
-Yes, of course. Speak at ease.
-Gosh.

731
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:33,603
Mun-jo, what do you do?

732
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,272
You don't seem like a type
who would live in a place like this.

733
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:37,857
Are you an artist?

734
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:43,488
-Why?
-I get this vibe from you

735
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:45,490
that you aren't an ordinary man...

736
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:49,285
I knew something smelled great.

737
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:52,080
You two were having late-night snacks.

738
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,587
-Is it good?
-Yes.

739
00:55:01,131 --> 00:55:02,090
This is

740
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:04,884
human meat.

741
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:08,888
Yes, I just heard. He told me.

742
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,974
I already did that prank.

743
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:12,809
You already did it.

744
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:17,105
I don't know why,
but when a new guy moves in,

745
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,232
we always end up doing that prank.

746
00:55:20,275 --> 00:55:22,235
Then did you do that to Jong-u too?

747
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:26,531
Yes. The man in room 303 was deep
in shock.

748
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:28,283
Gosh, Jong-u would be like that.

749
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:31,995
Come on, don't eat that with your hand.

750
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:38,877
I knew it. Ms. Um makes

751
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,962
the best food!

752
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,216
It's okay. I'm fine.

753
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,885
-It's okay.
-Have some more.

754
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:50,388
It's okay. I'm fine. I had a lot.

755
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:55,477
That's a shame. It was fun to see
how you seem to enjoy it as much as we do.

756
00:55:56,269 --> 00:55:57,187
Pardon?

757
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:06,571
I see. Okay.

758
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,908
Please excuse me, then.

759
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,201
Sure.

760
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,078
Thanks for the food.

761
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:17,415
Excuse me.

762
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:46,653
JONG-U

763
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:48,530
He won't pick up.

764
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:12,720
I'm the most concerned
about the fourth floor.

765
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:15,348
You said someone went
into the fourth floor.

766
00:57:15,431 --> 00:57:20,145
If no one lives there, who went in,
and why did that person go in there?

767
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:23,690
-The crime scene. Yes.
-The crime scene? Yes.

768
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,561
What are you doing?

769
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:08,146
Hold this.

770
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:14,402
-Hey, hey.
-Yes?

771
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:07,372
Young man in room 310.

772
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:15,588
You need to move out.

773
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:24,806
How many bags of flesh
can we get from him?

774
01:01:46,536 --> 01:01:47,954
Time to work.

775
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,950
What will you do with them
once we move out of here?

776
01:02:26,033 --> 01:02:27,201
I'll get rid of them.

777
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:30,913
I think there are murderers
at the residence I live in.

778
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:33,124
It's you, isn't it? It's me, Chang-hyeon.

779
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:36,794
Have you seen something
like an abandoned car around here?

780
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:40,256
I won this round.

781
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:43,342
What should we do
if the man in room 303 doesn't return?

782
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,595
He'll come soon. Don't worry.

783
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:46,679
Hey.

784
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:48,890
Will you run away again?

785
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:51,726
I'll wait for you in your room, Jong-u.

786
01:02:54,395 --> 01:02:56,731
