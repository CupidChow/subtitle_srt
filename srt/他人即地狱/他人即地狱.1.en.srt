(The places, labels, organizations, groups,
religions, and characters are all fiction.)

3
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,500
Typhoon Gimi has landed
on the Korean Peninsula.

4
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,180
A typhoon advisory has been
issued all over the nation.

5
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:16,980
The Gyunggi region is getting 1
to 1.5 inches of heavy rain per hour.

6
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,810
There are also strong winds.

7
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,940
It's expected to have some
damages from the typhoon.

8
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,550
Please take necessary steps to
avoid damages from the rain.

9
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,450
I don't think anyone is here.

10
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
Why?

11
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:42,770
This is a novel I started writing
when I was living in a goshiwon.

12
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,970
Yes.

13
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:54,950
To be honest, I used to think the world I
was living in was hell before I came here.

14
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,720
But...

15
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:09,930
the real hell was here.

16
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,840
A horrible hell made by a stranger.

17
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:16,990
(I was waiting for you.)

18
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,320
This place was hell.

19
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,660
A horrible hell made by a stranger.

20
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,850
How did I end up in this hell?

21
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,810
What did I do wrong?

22
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,790
(Strangers from Hell)

23
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:05,930
Sorry about that.

24
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,450
Sir!

25
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,470
Sir!

26
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:23,850
Excuse me!

27
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,100
(Ji-eun)

28
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,650
- Hey Ji-eun.
- Did you arrive?

29
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,370
Why did he just keep on going
when I called for him?

30
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,180
The weather is no joke.

31
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,930
Is something wrong?

32
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,310
Why do you sound like that?

33
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,940
What? Oh, it's nothing.

34
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:46,390
You can talk right now?
Aren't you at work?

35
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,150
I'm working away from the office right now.

36
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,180
Away?

37
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:52,470
I have a meeting with a
reporter about a new program.

38
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,300
Oh, the drama you're going
to be in charge of?

39
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:59,190
I need to go. I'll call you later.

40
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,080
Seoul...

41
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:23,710
My laptop....

42
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,320
The screen is all broken.

43
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,720
It will be $200.

44
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,140
$200?

45
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,130
Yes.

46
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,960
Just for replacing the screen?

47
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,440
- Yes.
- Don't be like that.

48
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,680
Give it to him for $180.

49
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,150
It's that expensive just
to replace the screen?

50
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,950
It's a good price. Don't tell anyone.

51
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,200
It will be over $300 if you go
to the official repair center.

52
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:55,960
Then please make sure
it's well taken care of.

53
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,590
Don't worry.

54
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,940
We'll make it look brand new.

55
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:01,980
- Please make it look brand new.
- Yes, sir.

56
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:17,560
Excuse me, how much is it
to replace a laptop screen?

57
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,960
For what size?

58
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,560
15 inches.

59
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,290
It's usually $200,

60
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,780
but I'll give it to you for $150.

61
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,800
$150?

62
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,090
I'll give it to you cheaper
if you pay in cash.

63
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,490
(First prize)

64
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:56,290
Congratulations! You got 5th place.
Come pick up your prize.

65
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,450
Congratulations!

66
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,030
Can I...

67
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,820
Sure, you can play.

68
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,640
I got last place 5 times.

69
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,410
But they're still pretty.

70
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,860
(Seoul Joongsugu Chakrodong 3-27)

71
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,880
It's the end room over there.

72
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,830
It's quiet and clean.

73
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,960
It gets good sunlight so I
think you'll really like it.

74
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,090
It's this place.

75
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,540
How much is it?

76
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,760
$550.

77
00:09:21,910 --> 00:09:22,910
How much is it?

78
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,130
$450.

79
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:41,490
I'll give you a 10% discount if
you pay 3 months in advance.

80
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,850
Then how much is it?

81
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,080
$270.

82
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,320
(Kimchi Stew $8, Korean Set Menu $7)

83
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,690
(Kimbab $2)

84
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,590
Put your bag more towards you.

85
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,570
(Monthly rent $250- $600)

86
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,090
Hello?

87
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,870
Hello, this is Eden Goshiwon.

88
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:00,480
I looked at your listing.
Do you have any available rooms?

89
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:01,880
Of course.

90
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,440
It's $190, right?

91
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,720
Yes, that's right.

92
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,460
Then I'll come see it later.

93
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:08,540
- Okay, see you later.
- Bye.

94
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,390
(Eden Goshiwon)

95
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,270
How can I live at
a place like this?

96
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,270
This is a no.

97
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,110
Are you the guy who called earlier?

98
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,150
Yes.

99
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,510
It must've been hard coming
up here in this weather.

100
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,660
I'm sorry I'm late.

101
00:13:40,690 --> 00:13:44,660
It's okay. It's a remote place so
everyone gets lost their first time.

102
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,020
Drink this.

103
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:50,780
I thought you sounded nice on the phone.
You're handsome.

104
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,320
I saw on the way up that the men's
and women's rooms are separated.

105
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:56,980
There must be a lot of rooms here.

106
00:13:57,010 --> 00:13:58,550
That's all in the past.

107
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,890
Everyone left because this
area is getting redeveloped.

108
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:02,050
There's only a few left.

109
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:03,610
When is the redevelopment?

110
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,260
They said they'll start in 6 months.

111
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,950
Why? You want to stay for a long time?

112
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,410
No, I'm going to leave soon.

113
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:11,560
That's good then!

114
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:14,780
This place is cheaper than others
because of the redevelopment.

115
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,830
But the facilities are really nice.

116
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:18,890
I care about the residents' health--

117
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,480
Oh, it's room 302.

118
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:24,320
I care about the residents'
health so I give eggs for free.

119
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,720
And I make the kimchi myself--

120
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:27,900
Look. This is 303, right?

121
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:28,750
Yes, it is.

122
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,390
It's hard for me to see.

123
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,790
I'm sure you've looked at other places.

124
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,780
This is the best you can get.

125
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:35,950
Here.

126
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,390
Oh, the trash...

127
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,500
You can't get a room this
size for that price in Seoul.

128
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:51,180
You said you were leaving soon anyway.

129
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:54,530
Yes, I'll be leaving soon but...

130
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:59,000
How can it be this cheap even
if it's getting redeveloped?

131
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:06,170
I'm a deacon at my
church so I can't lie.

132
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,140
To be honest,

133
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:11,600
the person who used to live in
this room committed suicide.

134
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,620
What?

135
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,770
He didn't die in this room.

136
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:20,770
You know, I'm telling you this because
I don't want to lie for a sale.

137
00:15:22,450 --> 00:15:24,450
I guess you're not from Seoul.

138
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,420
I came from the province.

139
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,840
Are you a college student?

140
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,980
No, I'm working.

141
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,160
Really?

142
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:33,270
You look so young so I
thought you were in college.

143
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,410
What the heck?

144
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,240
Why are you blocking the way?

145
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,530
Why are you being like that again?

146
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,820
Let's turn on the AC now!
The heat is killing me!

147
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:48,410
My goodness, he could just pass by.
Why does he have to get angry?

148
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,360
That gangster is getting on my nerves.

149
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,590
- Young man, don't worry.
- Okay.

150
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,870
He'll be gone soon.

151
00:15:58,230 --> 00:15:59,230
Oh...

152
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:01,140
I mean, he'll be leaving.

153
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,940
Come here. I'll make you iced coffee.

154
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:06,440
Have some while you think about it.
Come.

155
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,440
Everyone is nice besides him.

156
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,620
So, did you make a decision?

157
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,380
Yes.

158
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,340
I'll take it.

159
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,370
Okay.

160
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:54,410
Good choice.

161
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,370
All right then, here.

162
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:01,240
You can go to room 303, the
one that we saw earlier.

163
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,990
The other one is a
spare, so don't lose it.

164
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:06,230
Okay.

165
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:09,240
Think of it as your own home.

166
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,740
The bathrooms and showers are communal,
so it might be uncomfortable.

167
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:15,160
But hang in there.

168
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,340
Okay.

169
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,880
Everyone here left because
things worked out well for them.

170
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,230
Enjoy.

171
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,860
Thank you in advance.

172
00:17:22,890 --> 00:17:25,160
No, I should thank you in advance.

173
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,890
That's so loud.

174
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,060
Hello.

175
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,500
Did you want to say something?

176
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:21,640
It's not that room.

177
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,130
Oh.

178
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:26,170
Your room is over here.

179
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,510
You live here, right?

180
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:31,460
I'll be living in this room starting--

181
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,770
The bed is squeaky...

182
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,060
and there's mold, and the smell is...

183
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,870
It doesn't get much sunlight either.

184
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:01,700
All right, let's just live here for 6
months until I can save up the deposit.

185
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,960
This is pretty good for the price.

186
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,950
Hey mom.

187
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,050
Son, did you get there safely?

188
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,430
Yes I did.

189
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,930
Was your friend's house okay?

190
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,270
Yeah, it's all right.

191
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,410
Treat your friend well.

192
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,180
I got it, don't worry--

193
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,800
- Hold on.
- Okay, you must be busy.

194
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:32,810
Who is it?

195
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,180
Open the door.

196
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,200
Mom, I'll call you back.

197
00:20:36,230 --> 00:20:37,760
Okay, make sure you eat well.

198
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:38,770
Bye.

199
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:46,100
Yes?

200
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:48,170
You don't know the
basics of cohabitation!

201
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,090
What?

202
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,180
You should make a call outside.

203
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,410
Oh, you mean--

204
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:56,000
Did you make a call or not?

205
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,380
You could hear that?

206
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,950
I'm sorry.

207
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:03,540
You better not get on
my nerves from now on.

208
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,930
What is he doing?

209
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,120
He's getting on my nerves.

210
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:18,050
Damn it!

211
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,200
Hey Ji-eun.

212
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:37,570
Hey Jong-woo.

213
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,440
Did you find a goshiwon?

214
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
Yeah I did.

215
00:22:40,850 --> 00:22:41,960
Where is it?

216
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,380
Eunhyungu.

217
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
Eunhyungu?

218
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,770
Isn't that too far from Daekhakro?

219
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,760
It's okay. It's not that far.

220
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,050
It only takes about 30
minutes to get there.

221
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,210
And this is pretty close
to where you live too.

222
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,480
Okay, as long as you like it.

223
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,800
When are you getting off work today?

224
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,140
If it's okay with you, I'll--

225
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,170
Room 303!

226
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:07,280
Oh, sorry, go ahead.

227
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:11,740
Sorry Jong-woo. I was going
to see you today too but...

228
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,980
we're having a company dinner because
it's the team leader's birthday.

229
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
I see.

230
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:20,370
You have to unpack, and tomorrow
is your first day of work.

231
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,590
You should rest today.
Let's meet tomorrow.

232
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,960
That's okay, right?

233
00:23:23,990 --> 00:23:28,450
Yeah, I'm staying in Seoul now so
we can see each other more often.

234
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,170
Okay.

235
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,100
Handsome man.

236
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,770
Did you come to check out the rooftop?

237
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:38,840
Yes.

238
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,050
It's nice, right?

239
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,770
Yes.

240
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:47,410
By the way, I forgot to tell you earlier,

241
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,730
the fourth floor is the women's rooms.

242
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,770
No one lives there right now.

243
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,050
There was a fire so there
has to be construction,

244
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:57,090
but we can't get a loan
because of the economy.

245
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,140
So don't go in there.
You might get hurt.

246
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,300
Okay.

247
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:14,230
With a strange gait,

248
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:22,910
one man is walking in the alleyway.

249
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:31,720
The black plastic bag in his hand...

250
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,150
Kitty!

251
00:26:00,510 --> 00:26:01,510
Hello!

252
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:04,970
You're pretty.

253
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,570
You must be in a good mood today.

254
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:32,510
Oh, it's just...

255
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:37,830
You must be in a good mood today too.

256
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:40,740
You should be quiet at night.

257
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:43,810
You're causing an inconvenience for people.

258
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,790
I'll be quiet.

259
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,050
I'll be dead silent.

260
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,880
That looks good.

261
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,360
- The coffee...
- Sure.

262
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,230
- What is that?
- Hello.

263
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,120
Were you messing around somewhere?

264
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,140
I was just petting it!

265
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,470
You're really something.

266
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,500
He might really get hurt some day.

267
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,190
You're fine.

268
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,360
What are you doing?

269
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:21,430
You should just cut it.

270
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:10,260
Sir!

271
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:15,260
Do you know what's
good about a goshiwon?

272
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:25,900
No one cares if somebody dies here.

273
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:35,990
Hey.

274
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
Wake up.

275
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:19,260
Yes?

276
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,290
Where are you?

277
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:23,060
You should've called me right
away when you got to Seoul.

278
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:25,750
I'm sorry. I was busy
looking for homes.

279
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,520
Oh, I see.

280
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,240
- So did you find one?
- I found a goshiwon in Eunhyungu.

281
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,830
Why are you whispering?

282
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,040
It's not soundproof
because it's a goshiwon.

283
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,260
Come out. Let's grab a beer.

284
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,280
Where?

285
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:41,370
At Daekhakro, there's that...

286
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:42,780
I'll text you the address.

287
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:43,790
Okay, text me.

288
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,180
Damn it.

289
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:48,290
(Eden Goshiwon, 4th Floor Women's Rooms)

290
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,590
Excuse me!

291
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,050
What are you doing?

292
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:11,980
Huh?

293
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:17,620
No one lives there because there was a fire.

294
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:20,050
If you shoot this at me,

295
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,520
it's dangerous!

296
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:29,440
And I came up here
because I heard a noise.

297
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:30,990
Was it...

298
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:33,850
Did you hear a ghost?

299
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,450
I'm scared!

300
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,210
Jung-hwa, aren't you hot?

301
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,430
Let's just call someone.

302
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,790
Sir, turn on the car! Right now!

303
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,390
Come on!

304
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,340
Okay, good.

305
00:33:31,850 --> 00:33:32,850
Let's go.

306
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,500
Soh Jung-hwa, you really did study engineering.

307
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,510
I was a goddess at my school.

308
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:42,000
Let's hurry up and go.

309
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,220
Hello, you're the one who called it in?

310
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,780
What took you so long?

311
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,010
I'm sorry, we ran into
trouble on the way...

312
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,050
Where is it?

313
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,570
It's that black plastic bag.

314
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:01,090
I smelled something weird
so I came out to check...

315
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:27,910
Is it that again?

316
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,350
Yes, it's a cat.

317
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,800
- A dead cat?
- Yes.

318
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,900
This is the tenth time in a month.

319
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,720
Who the heck is doing this?

320
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:39,240
There are no security cameras here.

321
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,440
I'm sure it's someone who
knows this area well.

322
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,500
That might be true.

323
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:44,850
That's why you should put
the security cameras up.

324
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:47,040
The anxiety is killing me.

325
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:51,800
You can't complain to us. You should
submit a complaint to the city hall.

326
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,500
You should call the city's trash
department to take care of this--

327
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,560
Sir.

328
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,610
How can you say that as the police?

329
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,640
I mean...

330
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:02,100
We'll submit it to the
city and take care of it.

331
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,740
Don't worry. You should go inside.

332
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:06,530
Please get rid of it.
It gives me the creeps.

333
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,550
Take care.

334
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:17,660
Are we some dead cat clean up team?

335
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,190
Sir,

336
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:26,000
isn't this similar to the lodge
murder case from 3 months ago?

337
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,830
What do you mean?

338
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:32,120
The cats in that neighborhood started
dying, and then the murder happened.

339
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,790
We need to totally destroy people like that.

340
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,210
That's the problem.

341
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:39,160
Hey.

342
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,700
Just go to the dentist
and pull out that tooth.

343
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:44,510
A lot of places see
patients late these days.

344
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,030
This isn't enough to go to a dentist.

345
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,890
I think you should go see a dentist.

346
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,800
No, that's not what's important right now.

347
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,370
You know about Kang Ji-soon's case, right?

348
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:58,550
Do you know that he killed
and ate his own dog?

349
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,800
Psychopaths...

350
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:04,550
Psychopaths can't have pets
because they have no empathy.

351
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:06,820
And most serial killers...

352
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:11,900
There's research that shows most serial
killers have abused animals before.

353
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,340
So we really need to investigate this case.

354
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,790
We have to realize that it's really weird.

355
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:20,000
About the lodge murder case too.

356
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,430
The cats started dying first.

357
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,210
Was it practice or something?

358
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:26,110
I think you should go to
the dentist first and--

359
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,110
No, I said I'm not going!

360
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:30,000
That's not what's important right now!

361
00:36:31,010 --> 00:36:35,140
We're already closed but the
dentist is doing a special favor.

362
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:39,700
Aren't you guys open until 10 PM?

363
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:42,510
We're only open until 10 on
Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

364
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,550
Oh...

365
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:45,580
Officer Soh Jung-hwa?

366
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,880
I just got a call from Lieutenant Park.

367
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,310
Lieutenant Park?

368
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,440
Yes.

369
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,370
I'll take care of it. You two can go.

370
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,950
- It's okay.
- Really?

371
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,480
Yes, you can go home.

372
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,100
Thank you.

373
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,860
All right, let's take a look.

374
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:12,050
The cavity is deep.

375
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:14,530
You'll need a root canal.

376
00:37:15,410 --> 00:37:17,430
Does it hurt a lot?

377
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:22,130
I guess even an officer
is scared of dentists.

378
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,990
No...

379
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,730
Does it hurt?

380
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,750
I'll make sure it doesn't hurt.

381
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,220
I'll start with the anesthesia.

382
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,600
Can you make it not hurt?

383
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Open wide.

384
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,300
These are care instructions,
and here's the prescription.

385
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,410
It doesn't hurt at all, right?

386
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,440
No.

387
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,550
It's so cool.

388
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,790
But you have to come back next
week to get the root canal.

389
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:01,560
How's 7PM Wednesday?

390
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,190
Yes, that works.

391
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,510
I'll put it in the appointment books.

392
00:38:06,570 --> 00:38:10,110
By the way, you must be
close with my lieutenant.

393
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,620
Oh, I met him during
community service projects.

394
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:17,620
You didn't get to go home because of me.
Thank you.

395
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,280
You work way harder than me.
I should be thanking you.

396
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23,470
All right then, I'll get going.

397
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,910
Take care.

398
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:36,550
I had to get a loan and I'm working
hard with my business too.

399
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:39,510
No one starts a business with their own money.

400
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,650
What's important is how much you borrow.

401
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,430
Congrats on coming to Seoul.

402
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,860
You're the best.

403
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,390
Bottoms up. Let's drink up.

404
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,670
Do you still write?

405
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,480
Yes.

406
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,410
Damn, you still haven't given up on it?

407
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,140
So what is it about this time?

408
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,740
I'm writing a crime story.

409
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:13,650
How come you look normal on the outside but
are full of those thoughts on the inside?

410
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:15,240
It's amazing.

411
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,480
What did you do after coming to Seoul?

412
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:20,280
I looked for a place to live and...

413
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,150
Why don't you live with Ji-eun?

414
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:26,140
It'll be nice to live with her.
You can kiss her and stuff.

415
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,230
I haven't seen her in a while. Let's call her!

416
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:32,190
She's at a company dinner for
her team leader's birthday.

417
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,510
- Birthday?
- Yes.

418
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:37,020
It's just a birthday. Is it a
forced dinner or something?

419
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:40,180
This is why Korea's work
culture gets criticized.

420
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,120
There's nothing like that at my company.

421
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:44,650
It's very chill so that will be nice.

422
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:48,360
You're a chill person.

423
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:49,730
Yeah.

424
00:39:50,210 --> 00:39:51,480
How's the goshiwon?

425
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:56,130
It's tiny, and the walls
aren't soundproof at all.

426
00:39:56,590 --> 00:39:58,530
The bathrooms are shared too.

427
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:02,490
I heard goshitels have bathrooms
inside the rooms these days.

428
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:06,380
Those places are too expensive.
How am I supposed to live there?

429
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:07,620
They're expensive?

430
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:08,970
Hang in there.

431
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,010
I'll make you a regular
employee after your internship.

432
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:15,760
I think you're amazing.

433
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:17,350
You're a CEO.

434
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,580
It's nothing.

435
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,930
But you're a CEO already.

436
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:24,310
It's just about business.

437
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:27,710
If Ji-eun wants to marry
you and you say you

438
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:31,020
don't have money, she
might break up with you.

439
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:33,570
That will be bad. I've seen people--

440
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,880
You're frowning again, huh? You
were frowning earlier too.

441
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,920
No I'm not.

442
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,920
You keep saying weird stuff.

443
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,000
Weird stuff?

444
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:53,790
Nevermind.

445
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,620
It's nothing.

446
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:02,300
My gosh.

447
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:05,270
Your temper hasn't changed.

448
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,900
Let's go for a smoke.

449
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:10,150
Did you just get scared?

450
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:11,500
I think you did.

451
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,860
I'm not your friend.

452
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,880
How dare you talk informally to me!

453
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:28,350
- Do you not have a lighter either?
- I don't smoke anymore.

454
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:30,890
- Really?
- Yes.

455
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:33,660
I can't believe you.

456
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:39,120
Jong-woo, you really need to work hard.

457
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,460
You know how high the
unemployment rate is, right?

458
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:47,580
I picked you even though people with
impressive resumes begged me for a job.

459
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,160
- Thank you.
- Do a good job.

460
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,190
I will.

461
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,150
I care about you a lot.

462
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,060
I've told all the staff that you're
good, so don't disappoint me.

463
00:41:58,090 --> 00:42:00,530
- I'll work hard.
- Don't frown.

464
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:02,690
Okay.

465
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:09,220
Damn it. He's so snobby.

466
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,990
He's going to hurt him badly.

467
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,830
Isn't that too much? I think
we need to stop them.

468
00:42:27,870 --> 00:42:28,870
Let them be.

469
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:32,000
It's best to not get into
other people's business.

470
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:35,120
They were smoking too but they
won't lend me their lighter.

471
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,970
I think I need to call the police.

472
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,000
So not helpful.

473
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:41,010
Stop butting into people's business!

474
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:44,400
It can come back to you
if you get involved.

475
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,770
Let's go inside.

476
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:16,710
Yoon Jong-woo.

477
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:19,510
- What are you staring at?
- Stop it!

478
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:25,940
I said, stop!

479
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:27,690
Stop it!

480
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,440
Stop it!

481
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:32,390
Stop!

482
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:40,750
Here.

483
00:43:41,650 --> 00:43:42,650
Are you okay?

484
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:43,980
Thank you.

485
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:50,980
You look like a sheltered
rich boy, but you're so...

486
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,150
You're amazing.

487
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,290
I'll treat you to second round. Let's go.

488
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,200
I'm going to go home.

489
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:06,070
What are you talking about? I made
time out of my busy schedule for you!

490
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,260
Hey!

491
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,150
Yoon Jong-woo!

492
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:11,920
I'll buy you drinks next time.

493
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:13,710
Okay, come here.

494
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:14,860
Yoon Jong-woo!

495
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,680
Come here.

496
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,130
I said, come here!

497
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:32,770
Taxi!

498
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,480
For the cab.

499
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:41,090
- I'll take the bus.
- Just get in!

500
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,220
See you at the office tomorrow.

501
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,000
Here, take this.

502
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:48,010
Come on time.

503
00:44:56,300 --> 00:44:59,370
There must've been another
fight after drinks.

504
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:03,280
You know the theory that
human nature is evil?

505
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:05,040
I think it's true.

506
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:07,560
Look at how cruel the babies are.

507
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:12,180
They casually rip apart and
kill insects with a smile.

508
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:14,060
You know that saying?

509
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,840
Strangers are from hell?

510
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:17,920
Sir!

511
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:19,010
Yes?

512
00:45:20,460 --> 00:45:22,460
I'm sorry, but I'm tired.

513
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,790
You're too young to be tired.

514
00:46:08,010 --> 00:46:09,280
What are you doing?

515
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:15,810
How do you feel?

516
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,400
About what?

517
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:27,460
Doesn't standing here make you feel like
you're in a tunnel that you can't escape?

518
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,970
What the heck is he talking about?

519
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:31,870
I think I can escape.

520
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:36,490
You're funnier than you look.

521
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,350
Is he trying to pick a fight with me?

522
00:48:09,550 --> 00:48:11,480
Want to borrow my toothpaste?

523
00:48:11,550 --> 00:48:13,620
He's not stuttering anymore.

524
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:15,050
Yes.

525
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:25,130
Can I borrow your shampoo?

526
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:07,680
Are you making ramen?

527
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:08,990
Yes.

528
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,020
Make one for me too.

529
00:49:13,540 --> 00:49:15,600
I think you need to be careful.

530
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:18,570
Do you know that room 313 was here?

531
00:49:18,930 --> 00:49:20,580
- 313?
- Yes.

532
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:23,340
He kept staring at you from behind there.

533
00:49:23,370 --> 00:49:24,370
What?

534
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:31,950
Room 313. That pervert!

535
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,870
- Are you going to put eggs in there?
- Yes.

536
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,900
You can't put them in.

537
00:49:37,510 --> 00:49:38,510
Why not?

538
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:39,610
Try breaking it.

539
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:55,900
The landlord brings stuff you can't
eat and act like she's doing a favor.

540
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:05,880
How many ramens do you want?

541
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:08,230
Just five.

542
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:19,100
How old are you?

543
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:20,560
27.

544
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:22,730
You're a lot younger than me.

545
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:23,850
Get some kimchi.

546
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:33,550
It's all bull sh** when they say you're
supposed to suffer when you're young.

547
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:37,280
If you get stuck in a mental hospital
like this and don't get any sunlight,

548
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,820
even a normal person will go crazy.

549
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,830
Everyone in here is crazy.

550
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,110
I'm leaving next week.

551
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,640
I'm thinking about going back to
my hometown and run a fishery.

552
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:53,490
What am I even saying to you...

553
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:00,730
Be careful with the room next to you.

554
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,650
I'm telling you this because you
remind me of my baby brother.

555
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:11,710
Don't think about becoming friends with the
people here. Think about leaving soon.

556
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,730
You saw their eyes, right?

557
00:51:13,770 --> 00:51:16,370
You don't know what they're capable of.

558
00:51:22,950 --> 00:51:26,140
You're good at making ramen.

559
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:06,100
You must've had ramen.

560
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:09,730
Why do you look so scared?

561
00:52:09,830 --> 00:52:11,830
Let me sleep damn it!

562
00:52:14,060 --> 00:52:18,430
Room 306, stop going around
making weird noises.

563
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:19,980
I'm sorry!

564
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:37,700
You saw their eyes, right?

565
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:40,650
You don't know what they're capable of.

566
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:47,930
At that moment, all the stress I got
today came rushing directed at him.

567
00:52:47,950 --> 00:52:49,550
What are you looking at?

568
00:52:54,420 --> 00:52:56,220
I shouldn't have done that.

569
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,370
I said, what are you looking at?

570
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,750
Damn it!

571
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:32,670
Kill him or don't...

572
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,240
Kill him or don't...

573
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:38,360
Kill him or don't...

574
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,470
Kill him or don't...

575
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:49,960
Kill him or don't...

576
00:54:50,900 --> 00:54:52,230
Kill him or don't...

577
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,590
Kill him or don't...

578
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,060
Kill him or don't...

579
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:00,040
Kill him or don't...

580
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:14,540
Just kill me now.

581
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:18,480
Okay, how would you like me to kill you?

582
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,890
Hey, tell me.

583
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:02,410
Where are you going?

584
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:05,300
What are you doing?

585
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,440
What?

586
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,940
Why are you doing that?

587
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,400
What is he doing?

588
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:18,790
Give me the gun!

589
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,290
Give it to me. Stand up straight.

590
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,000
What did you take from my room?

591
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:26,360
- Why were you in there?
- I didn't...

592
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:28,300
What did you touch?

593
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:30,030
What is it?

594
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:32,880
It really wasn't me!

595
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:34,690
Yeah it was!

596
00:57:36,170 --> 00:57:37,170
It wasn't me.

597
00:57:38,430 --> 00:57:40,030
Want to bet your wrist on it?

598
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:06,610
Did something fun happen?

599
00:58:09,870 --> 00:58:11,930
Are you guys playing a joke on me?

600
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:14,300
What? They were twins?

601
00:58:15,580 --> 00:58:18,930
You need to give me your wrist now, right?

602
00:58:19,890 --> 00:58:20,890
Damn it.

603
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,110
- Move.
- Calm down.

604
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:25,950
Move before I beat you up.

605
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:27,850
What's going on?

606
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,040
You should calm down.

607
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:35,710
Why are you butting in?

608
00:58:35,930 --> 00:58:38,210
We're neighbors, aren't I right?

609
00:58:38,450 --> 00:58:40,680
He keeps coming into my room!

610
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:42,640
Did you see it for yourself?

611
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:45,150
Sir, did you go into his room?

612
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:46,440
Are you kidding me?

613
00:58:46,950 --> 00:58:49,410
Why would I go in there?

614
00:58:49,930 --> 00:58:51,140
It's not my room!

615
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:52,490
You little!

616
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:14,430
You should calm down.

617
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:16,840
We have a new neighbor watching.

618
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:20,350
They already knew...

619
00:59:34,290 --> 00:59:38,040
that this place was hell.

620
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:08,630
(Strangers from Hell)

621
01:00:09,820 --> 01:00:11,670
I heard there was a
commotion last night.

622
01:00:11,690 --> 01:00:13,500
The gangster guy...

623
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:15,440
He told me he was leaving.

624
01:00:15,540 --> 01:00:18,460
There are only good guys left here now, right?

625
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:20,700
I'm Yoon Jong-woo, a new
intern starting today.

626
01:00:20,740 --> 01:00:23,090
- Did you all say hello?
- We did, earlier.

627
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,380
I think it belongs to the guy
who lived here before me.

628
01:00:25,410 --> 01:00:27,080
Are you sure you're okay?

629
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:30,300
There's a lot of things I
have to do because of you.

630
01:00:30,390 --> 01:00:31,790
I'm going to be busy.

631
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:34,870
I'm going to go straight home after work.

632
01:00:35,950 --> 01:00:37,420
I want to see someone.

633
01:00:38,230 --> 01:00:39,970
