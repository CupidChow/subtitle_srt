3
00:01:07,514 --> 00:01:08,769
Honey,

4
00:01:10,664 --> 00:01:12,098
how would you like to be killed?

5
00:01:15,563 --> 00:01:16,839
Open your eyes.

6
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:22,108
Wake up.

7
00:02:35,984 --> 00:02:37,059
Who are you?

8
00:02:40,613 --> 00:02:41,789
Who's there?

9
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:53,308
Run away.

10
00:02:56,464 --> 00:02:57,738
Run away, I'm telling you.

11
00:03:26,293 --> 00:03:30,308
(Episode 7. The Horror of the Basement)

12
00:03:59,263 --> 00:04:01,039
Eat slowly.

13
00:04:03,404 --> 00:04:05,749
Dad, your cooking is always the best.

14
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:07,678
It's honestly the best food ever.

15
00:04:08,274 --> 00:04:10,148
- What? - The best food ever.

16
00:04:12,003 --> 00:04:13,548
I mean, it's delicious.

17
00:04:13,744 --> 00:04:15,988
Eat some more if you like it that much.

18
00:04:16,283 --> 00:04:17,558
I cooked a lot anyway.

19
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:19,488
I'll finish this bowl of rice first.

20
00:04:24,353 --> 00:04:27,199
Are your teeth hurting again? Have you visited the dentist yet?

21
00:04:27,223 --> 00:04:28,328
No.

22
00:04:29,223 --> 00:04:32,238
I was supposed to get some care after the endodontic treatment,

23
00:04:32,733 --> 00:04:35,039
but I just didn't have the time, and now it hurts again.

24
00:04:35,163 --> 00:04:37,204
You're clearly not in enough pain yet.

25
00:04:37,204 --> 00:04:39,909
- Make sure you visit the dentist. - Will do later.

26
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:43,018
You dummy, you think the dentist will be open on a Sunday?

27
00:04:43,704 --> 00:04:45,949
There are some that open on Sundays.

28
00:04:46,543 --> 00:04:47,689
- Really? - Yes.

29
00:04:48,214 --> 00:04:50,813
It's great that you're working hard but take care of yourself first.

30
00:04:50,813 --> 00:04:51,919
Fine.

31
00:04:57,184 --> 00:04:58,329
Dad,

32
00:04:58,884 --> 00:05:00,669
the rookie looked into it...

33
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:03,498
and the lady is really weird.

34
00:05:04,993 --> 00:05:08,368
She had two husbands, and both passed away in an accident,

35
00:05:08,464 --> 00:05:09,933
so did her parents.

36
00:05:09,933 --> 00:05:11,839
So she got all the insurance money.

37
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:14,303
And she operated an orphanage...

38
00:05:14,303 --> 00:05:17,419
which burned down and, she got more insurance money out of that.

39
00:05:17,673 --> 00:05:21,019
Really? Then she must've been suspected for all the deaths.

40
00:05:21,743 --> 00:05:24,889
And if the orphanage was on fire, it would've been on the news.

41
00:05:26,654 --> 00:05:27,729
Right?

42
00:05:28,853 --> 00:05:30,529
You're right.

43
00:05:31,524 --> 00:05:34,428
Dad, thanks so much.

44
00:05:34,723 --> 00:05:38,368
Only cows lie down right after eating.

45
00:05:39,564 --> 00:05:40,993

47
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:48,479
(Spring Orphanage is on fire, and the suspect is the owner?)

48
00:05:50,074 --> 00:05:51,103
Hello.

49
00:05:51,103 --> 00:05:54,673
(Yu Spring Dentist)

50
00:05:54,673 --> 00:05:56,389
(Spring Orphanage is on fire, and the suspect is the owner?)

51
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:20,378
I read in a book...

52
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:22,618
that murders begin...

53
00:06:22,704 --> 00:06:25,248
by killing animals first.

54
00:06:26,113 --> 00:06:28,448
It may not just be a joke.

55
00:06:28,873 --> 00:06:30,618
Do you think so as well?

56
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:33,529
Why? Are you suspecting anyone?

57
00:06:56,603 --> 00:06:58,948
These nightmares are driving me crazy.

58
00:06:59,514 --> 00:07:01,948
I have to get out of here.

59
00:07:10,683 --> 00:07:13,529
Hello, can you hold on for a second?

60
00:07:17,024 --> 00:07:19,368
Thank you for this last night.

61
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:21,709
I could charge my phone thanks to you.

62
00:07:22,634 --> 00:07:25,008
That's mine, sorry.

63
00:07:26,134 --> 00:07:29,318
This is yours.

64
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:31,704
The one I just handed to you is mine that's broken.

65
00:07:31,704 --> 00:07:34,719
You have to talk quieter here.

66
00:07:35,344 --> 00:07:36,514
Sorry.

67
00:07:36,514 --> 00:07:38,959
Don't apologize to me.

68
00:07:39,214 --> 00:07:43,053
The people here are just weird.

69
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:45,423
Just don't make loud sounds.

70
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:48,669
Have you been living here for a long time?

71
00:07:49,923 --> 00:07:52,933
No, I'm quite new here as well.

72
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:54,539
I see.

73
00:07:55,064 --> 00:07:56,808
How is it living here?

74
00:07:56,904 --> 00:07:59,979
The place I lived before wasn't that great.

75
00:08:00,204 --> 00:08:04,074
Why don't we go out and talk?

76
00:08:04,074 --> 00:08:05,279
Sure.

77
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,144
- You were going out, right? - Yes.

78
00:08:07,144 --> 00:08:08,318
Let's go.

79
00:08:13,183 --> 00:08:14,858
Are you going somewhere?

80
00:08:15,613 --> 00:08:18,154
I'm thinking of taking a walk. You?

81
00:08:18,154 --> 00:08:19,524
I'm going to a performance.

82
00:08:19,524 --> 00:08:21,428
Are you a singer?

83
00:08:21,623 --> 00:08:23,938
No, not a singer. I'm a rapper.

84
00:08:24,423 --> 00:08:25,894
That's cool.

85
00:08:25,894 --> 00:08:28,334
It's really not that cool. What about you?

86
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:30,639
I work at a performance promotion company.

87
00:08:30,704 --> 00:08:33,603
Really? Then do you hold music performances as well?

88
00:08:33,603 --> 00:08:35,108
No, it's for theater productions.

89
00:08:35,774 --> 00:08:37,404
We're still both in the performing art industry.

90
00:08:37,404 --> 00:08:39,443
Which way are you heading?

91
00:08:39,444 --> 00:08:40,849
This way.

92
00:08:41,314 --> 00:08:42,344
Where are you going?

93
00:08:42,344 --> 00:08:45,019
I can go either way. Let's go this way then.

94
00:08:46,514 --> 00:08:49,498
It's so hot today. How old are you?

95
00:08:49,524 --> 00:08:51,329
I'm 27.

96
00:08:51,884 --> 00:08:54,599
You look so young for your age. I'm 25 years old.

97
00:08:54,623 --> 00:08:57,993
How did you come to this studio?

98
00:08:57,993 --> 00:09:00,238
I saw it online.

99
00:09:00,634 --> 00:09:03,008
I've never lived in a room without air conditioning though.

100
00:09:04,464 --> 00:09:06,048
Can I call you Brother?

101
00:09:06,204 --> 00:09:07,409
Sure.

102
00:09:07,704 --> 00:09:09,448
You can be comfortable with me.

103
00:09:09,803 --> 00:09:13,173
I'll get comfortable with you, it just takes some time.

104
00:09:13,173 --> 00:09:14,674
I'll help you out.

105
00:09:14,674 --> 00:09:16,784
Okay.

106
00:09:16,784 --> 00:09:19,688
Is there anyone at the studio that's also our age?

107
00:09:21,314 --> 00:09:23,623
There are some men in their 30s,

108
00:09:23,623 --> 00:09:25,529
but they're all insane.

109
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:27,023
Insane?

110
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:29,098
They're weird.

111
00:09:30,164 --> 00:09:32,363
If you're not busy tonight...

112
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,539
Hello.

113
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:36,678
Hello.

114
00:09:37,334 --> 00:09:39,239
- You must be the new guy. - Yes.

115
00:09:39,403 --> 00:09:43,048
Hello, I'm Kang Seok Yun. I just moved in yesterday.

116
00:09:43,174 --> 00:09:44,304
Do you live here?

117
00:09:44,304 --> 00:09:46,149
I live here.

118
00:09:46,314 --> 00:09:47,914
You're very cheerful.

119
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:51,489
I'd like to think that I am.

120
00:09:52,983 --> 00:09:55,353
You two must've been talking about something fun.

121
00:09:55,353 --> 00:09:58,629
We were just saying hi.

122
00:09:59,284 --> 00:10:00,669
Are you going somewhere?

123
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:02,698
Just on a walk.

124
00:10:03,294 --> 00:10:04,539
Just on a walk?

125
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:06,739
That's a great idea.

126
00:10:07,233 --> 00:10:08,834
It's not that hot today.

127
00:10:08,834 --> 00:10:10,139
Aren't you hot?

128
00:10:10,564 --> 00:10:11,779
What?

129
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:14,609
You're wearing long sleeves in summer.

130
00:10:14,973 --> 00:10:17,078
Are you scared that you'll get darker?

131
00:10:17,674 --> 00:10:18,848
No.

132
00:10:19,414 --> 00:10:20,889
I have a scar on my arm.

133
00:10:20,973 --> 00:10:22,218
A scar?

134
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:24,119
Yes.

135
00:10:25,613 --> 00:10:28,859
Let's grab a beer with everyone at the studio when you have time.

136
00:10:29,084 --> 00:10:31,198
Do you do that here?

137
00:10:31,223 --> 00:10:33,992
Of course. There's not a lot of us...

138
00:10:33,993 --> 00:10:37,363
and we're all around the same age. It'll be good living here.

139
00:10:37,363 --> 00:10:39,539
Sure, that sounds great.

140
00:10:40,993 --> 00:10:41,993
Bye now.

141
00:10:41,993 --> 00:10:43,578
See you later.

142
00:10:47,903 --> 00:10:51,048
He's so handsome.

143
00:10:51,403 --> 00:10:55,519
By the looks of the two of you, everyone here must be handsome.

144
00:10:56,444 --> 00:10:58,019
How lucky.

145
00:11:00,814 --> 00:11:01,928
Brother.

146
00:11:02,924 --> 00:11:04,083
Brother?

147
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:05,153
Yes?

148
00:11:05,153 --> 00:11:07,324
If you aren't busy tonight,

149
00:11:07,324 --> 00:11:09,328
would you like to come and watch me perform?

150
00:11:09,723 --> 00:11:11,298
- Perform? - Yes.

151
00:11:11,564 --> 00:11:14,968
Sure, I'd rather go than to stay here all day.

152
00:11:15,694 --> 00:11:17,239
- Let's go. - Okay.

153
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:20,034
Don't laugh at me because I'm bad.

154
00:11:20,034 --> 00:11:21,178
I won't.

155
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:25,279
Where are you performing?

156
00:11:27,344 --> 00:11:29,414
- Why aren't you picking up? - This is it.

157
00:11:29,414 --> 00:11:30,818
Why was your phone off?

158
00:11:33,284 --> 00:11:36,353
I wrote the song late last night. Please excuse my mistakes.

159
00:11:36,353 --> 00:11:37,529
No worries.

160
00:11:38,123 --> 00:11:39,924
This is my first time ever seeing...

161
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:42,899
a rapper perform on the streets.

162
00:11:43,064 --> 00:11:45,723
I'm getting nervous.

163
00:11:45,723 --> 00:11:49,194
I'm really bad, so just don't get your hopes up.

164
00:11:49,194 --> 00:11:50,909
- Okay. - Yes.

165
00:11:51,003 --> 00:11:54,208
I'm so nervous. You can sit there.

166
00:11:55,003 --> 00:11:57,149
Stop it!

167
00:12:04,784 --> 00:12:06,928
Give it to me. Hand it over!

168
00:12:08,513 --> 00:12:11,499
Mother, Father, money.

169
00:12:11,883 --> 00:12:15,968
Mother, Father, money. When I was 5,

170
00:12:16,054 --> 00:12:17,824
I ran away with Mom's money

171
00:12:17,824 --> 00:12:20,993
When I was 6, I ran away with Dad's money

172
00:12:20,993 --> 00:12:24,464
Snacks, stealing, swindling,

173
00:12:24,464 --> 00:12:28,273
I'll run away with money like a swindler

174
00:12:28,273 --> 00:12:31,804
Grandma always told me,

175
00:12:31,804 --> 00:12:34,773
You lose if you stammer

176
00:12:34,773 --> 00:12:38,359
Grandma used to work early mornings for money

177
00:12:38,513 --> 00:12:41,554
Don't you ever forget what the most important thing is

178
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:45,824
Skinny brats would tease me, as I sing for my grandma,

179
00:12:45,824 --> 00:12:48,623
Promising that I'll never let her go

180
00:12:48,623 --> 00:12:50,664
But I couldn't keep the promise,

181
00:12:50,664 --> 00:12:53,934
And ran away with 10 dollar bills rolled up in her pillow

182
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:56,633
who couldn't wake up to the alarm early morning

183
00:12:56,633 --> 00:12:59,578
Mother, Father, money

184
00:12:59,873 --> 00:13:02,903
Mother, Father, money

00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:04,978
I'm out

186
00:13:05,403 --> 00:13:06,548
Thank you.

187
00:13:07,414 --> 00:13:08,588
Great.

188
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:15,159
I'm hungry.

189
00:13:15,414 --> 00:13:17,458
Let's walk slower, my feet hurt.

190
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:20,098
What's that?

191
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,728
- What? - It's all over your leg.

192
00:13:22,794 --> 00:13:24,568
What's this?

193
00:13:26,194 --> 00:13:27,834
We didn't even sit anywhere.

194
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:28,968
No.

195
00:13:29,034 --> 00:13:30,338
What is this?

196
00:13:30,363 --> 00:13:32,039
I think you should take it off.

197
00:13:36,674 --> 00:13:39,143
What psycho did this?

198
00:13:39,143 --> 00:13:40,588
- Are you all right? - Yes.

201
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:38,603
- Hello. - Hello. What's your name?

202
00:14:38,603 --> 00:14:41,048
I'm Soh Jung Hwa. My appointment is scheduled at 2pm.

203
00:14:41,334 --> 00:14:45,243
Yes, Doctor is almost done with the other patient. Please wait.

204
00:14:45,243 --> 00:14:46,389
Okay.

(Volunteer)

207
00:15:05,893 --> 00:15:08,833
It's a photo of me giving medical support to the seniors here.

208
00:15:08,834 --> 00:15:10,308
I see.

209
00:15:11,034 --> 00:15:13,208
I go once a month. Would you like to join?

210
00:15:13,603 --> 00:15:14,808
What?

211
00:15:15,704 --> 00:15:18,448
Doctor,

212
00:15:19,714 --> 00:15:22,019
do you know Spring Orphanage by any chance?

213
00:15:22,214 --> 00:15:24,314
It has the same name as our office.

214
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:25,389
Yes.

215
00:15:26,814 --> 00:15:28,183
I know it well.

216
00:15:28,184 --> 00:15:29,999
I'm from there.

217
00:15:30,324 --> 00:15:31,629
Sorry?

218
00:15:31,684 --> 00:15:34,198
That's why I named my office after the orphanage.

219
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:36,698
I wanted to help people like the orphanage did.

220
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:38,669
Then do you know...

221
00:15:38,924 --> 00:15:40,838
this person right here?

222
00:15:41,194 --> 00:15:43,068
- Ms. Eom Bok Soon? - Yes.

223
00:15:43,633 --> 00:15:45,409
She was the owner of our orphanage.

224
00:15:45,603 --> 00:15:48,872
I know it's a cliche way of describing her,

225
00:15:48,873 --> 00:15:51,448
but she's like my mother to me.

226
00:15:52,603 --> 00:15:55,119
She now operates a studio.

227
00:15:55,273 --> 00:15:57,289
The one on the hill, right?

228
00:15:58,284 --> 00:15:59,389
Right.

229
00:15:59,883 --> 00:16:01,584
You must know it well since it's your district.

230
00:16:01,584 --> 00:16:02,989
- Yes. - That's the studio.

231
00:16:03,324 --> 00:16:04,759
I live there now as well.

232
00:16:05,723 --> 00:16:09,269
Why do you live there?

233
00:16:09,763 --> 00:16:10,838
Well,

234
00:16:11,863 --> 00:16:13,664
I was supposed to move in elsewhere,

235
00:16:13,664 --> 00:16:15,769
but my move-in date got delayed.

236
00:16:16,603 --> 00:16:17,909
I'm talking too much.

237
00:16:18,704 --> 00:16:21,208
I missed living with Ms. Eom.

238
00:16:23,804 --> 00:16:25,779
I see.

239
00:16:26,513 --> 00:16:29,348
You're very curious about me.

240
00:16:30,743 --> 00:16:34,914
There's just a lot of coincidence.

241
00:16:34,914 --> 00:16:37,259
Never mind.

242
00:16:37,684 --> 00:16:39,023
- Shall we head in? - Shall we?

243
00:16:39,023 --> 00:16:40,098
Sure.

244
00:16:45,694 --> 00:16:47,838
What would you like?

245
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:51,733
Isn't this an expensive place?

246
00:16:51,733 --> 00:16:54,808
It's fine, I'm a regular here, and it's quite cheap.

247
00:16:55,503 --> 00:16:57,873
- Would you like some tteokbokki? - Sure, whatever is good.

248
00:16:57,873 --> 00:17:00,873
Okay. 1 tteokbokki and 1 ramyeon, please.

249
00:17:00,873 --> 00:17:02,519
- Okay. - Thank you.

250
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:05,489
Should we grab a beer?

251
00:17:05,883 --> 00:17:07,129
Let's have soju instead.

252
00:17:07,954 --> 00:17:09,188
Let's have both then.

253
00:17:10,523 --> 00:17:12,253
- No, just soju. - Soju?

254
00:17:12,253 --> 00:17:13,468
Fine, soju it is.

255
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:15,698
Soju.

256
00:17:34,643 --> 00:17:35,818
Thank you.

257
00:17:45,924 --> 00:17:47,928
Did something happen last night?

258
00:17:48,123 --> 00:17:50,094
Your facial expression last night scared me.

259
00:17:50,094 --> 00:17:51,538
You looked glum.

260
00:17:57,703 --> 00:17:58,909
And?

261
00:18:00,334 --> 00:18:01,409
Well,

262
00:18:02,504 --> 00:18:03,649
your eyes...

263
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:06,278
seemed as if you wanted to kill someone.

264
00:18:13,113 --> 00:18:16,559
Moving into this studio,

265
00:18:17,754 --> 00:18:20,799
I had the roughest first week.

266
00:18:21,294 --> 00:18:22,528
Did something happen?

267
00:18:23,994 --> 00:18:25,994
Hearing you rap,

268
00:18:25,994 --> 00:18:27,968
I realized that we're quite similar.

269
00:18:28,994 --> 00:18:30,678
- You're not from Seoul, right? - No.

270
00:18:31,863 --> 00:18:33,208
- Raised by a single mother? - Yes.

271
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:36,278
- Me too. - Really?

272
00:18:37,103 --> 00:18:38,419
You...

273
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,943
You didn't seem like the type at all.

274
00:18:41,943 --> 00:18:44,089
I thought you had a smooth life.

275
00:18:46,754 --> 00:18:48,028
That being said,

276
00:18:51,054 --> 00:18:52,859
- we need to get out of here. - What?

277
00:18:54,693 --> 00:18:58,399
(Eden Studio)

278
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:08,379
The sauce is good.

279
00:19:21,913 --> 00:19:24,659
Let's go catch some fish by the ocean

280
00:19:24,824 --> 00:19:26,329
Repent, repent.

281
00:19:26,923 --> 00:19:28,524
Let's go catch some fish by the mountains

282
00:19:28,524 --> 00:19:32,899
Let's bottle them all up

283
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:38,708
And let's take it all home

284
00:19:41,504 --> 00:19:43,079
Let's catch some fish

285
00:20:11,963 --> 00:20:13,948
Come here, let's eat.

286
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:16,409
I brought locally grown beef for you.

287
00:20:17,474 --> 00:20:20,188
Aren't you hungry? Let's eat.

288
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:28,255
The thug guy came in, saying,

289
00:21:28,650 --> 00:21:30,249
"You don't think I know that you're all on one side?"

290
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:33,965
The way they were looking at him made it seem like it was true.

291
00:21:34,819 --> 00:21:37,864
I think they're really in this together.

292
00:21:38,489 --> 00:21:41,435
Do you think they may be organ traffickers?

293
00:21:41,729 --> 00:21:44,229
I thought of that too, which is why I don't feel good,

294
00:21:44,229 --> 00:21:46,304
but do you really think that'd happen at a studio?

295
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:48,505
No, let's not go that far.

296
00:21:49,569 --> 00:21:51,700
I'll speak informally to you now.

297
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,339
- Go ahead. - At least you're here,

298
00:21:53,339 --> 00:21:56,384
now the studio will feel a little less weird.

299
00:21:57,579 --> 00:21:59,114
Who lived here before?

300
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,755
The thug lived in your room.

301
00:22:04,749 --> 00:22:09,089
He kept yelling about how someone keeps breaking into his room,

302
00:22:09,089 --> 00:22:10,589
then moved out right away.

303
00:22:10,589 --> 00:22:12,495
Another man moved out the day after.

304
00:22:13,489 --> 00:22:17,059
I love watching criminal movies,

305
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:18,100
Yes?

306
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,844
and I think there's definitely something fishy going on here.

307
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:24,175
I think we can look into this further and find something.

308
00:22:24,339 --> 00:22:26,045
What do you mean look into this?

309
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:29,745
Everyone is insane. Don't anger them.

310
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,515
The fourth floor bothers me the most.

311
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:35,425
You said someone keeps entering the fourth floor,

312
00:22:35,509 --> 00:22:36,894
but nobody lives there.

313
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:40,094
Who could it be and why would they keep going there?

314
00:22:40,789 --> 00:22:41,965
There's...

315
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,319
probably a cliche story behind it.

316
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:46,420
There's something hidden there...

317
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,664
- or something. - That's right.

318
00:22:47,829 --> 00:22:49,430
- Something illegal. - Something illegal.

319
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:50,460
Right.

320
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,569
Ms. Eom said that nobody lives there.

321
00:22:53,569 --> 00:22:57,574
But I keep hearing weird sounds coming out of there.

322
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,314
It's weird.

323
00:23:01,239 --> 00:23:02,785
Something is definitely fishy.

324
00:23:04,309 --> 00:23:06,084
I'm going to go in and see for myself sometime.

325
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,354
- Hey. - What?

326
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,195
Don't do it.

327
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,795
Fine, I won't.

328
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,965
Don't ever enter the fourth floor.

329
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:19,134
All right.

330
00:23:22,589 --> 00:23:23,975
So,

331
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,705
how long do you plan on staying here for?

332
00:23:27,029 --> 00:23:29,130
I have to stay here until I work some part-time jobs...

333
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:31,039
and earn enough money.

334
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,445
I think I'm going to be here for at least six months.

335
00:23:36,269 --> 00:23:39,039
What a pathetic life you live.

336
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,579
It's okay,

337
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:43,554
it's normal for youngsters like us to live pathetic lives.

338
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,279
While we're on the topic...

339
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:47,364
Yes?

340
00:23:47,749 --> 00:23:49,220
When I'm not home,

341
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:52,289
and if someone tries to go into my room,

342
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:54,304
can you take a photo of that?

343
00:23:54,489 --> 00:23:57,275
But your door is locked.

344
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,545
Who can go in?

345
00:24:01,370 --> 00:24:05,870
Ms. Eom said that it wouldn't ever unlock, but nobody knows.

346
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,945
Imagine her being one of them.

347
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,114
Then she can open the door for whoever it is.

348
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:17,324
I just get a strange feeling whenever I enter my room.

349
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:23,960
Then I'll take photos of everything...

350
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:26,435
that seems fishy.

351
00:24:27,829 --> 00:24:30,235
- Thank you. - No problem.

352
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:32,535
Seok Yun,

353
00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:36,874
you and I both have to...

354
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:40,170
first find a way to get out of this studio.

355
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,685
That's the only way to live.

356
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:44,354
We can only do that if we have money.

357
00:24:46,539 --> 00:24:50,124
We're so broke.

358
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:53,380
I'll earn lots of money, buy you beer...

359
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,765
and everything else nice. Don't worry too much.

360
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:58,235
You'll succeed one day for sure. I'll get going now.

361
00:24:59,989 --> 00:25:01,029
What'll you do?

362
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:03,289
I should go. I have to...

363
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:04,360
see my girlfriend.

364
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,160
- You have a girlfriend? - Yes.

365
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,404
I'm jealous.

366
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,914
Where will you go?

367
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,940
I stayed up last night writing some rap verses.

368
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,614
I'm tired, so I'll shower and go to bed.

369
00:25:18,079 --> 00:25:20,554
Make sure your door's locked, okay?

370
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:22,925
- Don't you worry. - Okay.

371
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,920
I'm glad you heard me out today.

372
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,695
It was nothing.

373
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:31,594
- See you. - Take care.

374
00:25:32,059 --> 00:25:33,664
- See you later. - Okay.

375
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,864
Have a great night.

376
00:25:52,539 --> 00:25:54,054
She'll still be up.

377
00:25:58,079 --> 00:26:01,695
(Ji Eun, are you asleep?)

378
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,670
Bye. Thanks for the ride.

379
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,245
It was nothing.

380
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,114
I'm sorry to let you go.

381
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,200
Sorry about what?

382
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,739
How about a beer inside?

383
00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:24,079
I can't. I have a roommate.

384
00:26:24,079 --> 00:26:25,584
We can all drink together.

385
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,850
Call me if you want. Can I come in to rest?

386
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:30,025
- Go on home. - I'm just tired.

387
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:31,950
- Go home. - I'll call.

388
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:33,124
Okay.

389
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:39,834
She's cute.

390
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,200
(Seok Yun, Ji Eun)

391
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,975
(Seok Yun)

392
00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:52,045
He's outside my room again?

393
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,344
(I'm about to go to bed. Is something wrong?)

394
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,235
(Are you...)

395
00:27:12,519 --> 00:27:13,904
(Are you okay?)

396
00:27:15,089 --> 00:27:16,334
(Hey!)

397
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:20,729
(Are you okay?)

398
00:27:20,729 --> 00:27:22,144
(Ji Eun)

399
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:29,440
Darn it.

400
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,554
(Ji Eun)

401
00:27:38,749 --> 00:27:39,995
(Available)

402
00:27:42,289 --> 00:27:45,394
What does he think he's doing?

403
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:51,334
Will you pick up?

404
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:55,005
- Hey. - Hey, you!

405
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:58,045
Why didn't you pick up?

406
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:01,445
Sorry. Man, that was really freaky.

407
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,414
Why? What happened?

408
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:06,215
I was filming in secret when he turned around.

409
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:08,455
I just happened to get that photo.

410
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:11,525
Then... Then did he...

411
00:28:11,549 --> 00:28:13,249
Did he see you? Are you okay?

412
00:28:13,249 --> 00:28:14,720
Yes, I'm fine.

413
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,289
He kept asking what I was doing,

414
00:28:16,289 --> 00:28:18,535
so I made an excuse and came to the roof.

415
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,829
He looked really frightening.

416
00:28:21,829 --> 00:28:23,564
Shall I post it online?

417
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,445
You stupid... Did he follow you upstairs?

418
00:28:27,569 --> 00:28:29,729
I told you to leave them alone.

419
00:28:29,729 --> 00:28:31,675
You never know what they'll do.

420
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,015
I'm on my way. I'll see you there.

421
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:36,844
Okay, hurry back.

422
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,515
Your story and then this is giving me the chills.

423
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:43,279
Go to your room and keep the door locked.

424
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,854
They could come in and cut you up at any time.

425
00:28:47,549 --> 00:28:51,465
Okay. Get back quick. See you.

426
00:28:56,729 --> 00:28:58,604
Darn this psycho.

427
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,374
He's out of his mind.

428
00:29:02,729 --> 00:29:04,045
The nutjob.

429
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,515
Darn it.

430
00:29:12,516 --> 00:29:17,516

431
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,735
Will you be more careful?

432
00:29:25,759 --> 00:29:28,834
You should be the one to watch where you're going.

433
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:31,775
What?

434
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,404
Mr. 303.

435
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,074
What?

436
00:29:38,269 --> 00:29:42,015
You know this is all because of you, don't you?

437
00:29:42,769 --> 00:29:44,054
Darn it.

438
00:29:44,779 --> 00:29:46,854
I am talking to you.

439
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:50,925
What is it?

440
00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:54,695
Are you...

441
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,435
belittling me?

442
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:00,195
Speak clearly so that I can understand.

443
00:30:01,089 --> 00:30:02,735
You're just talking nonsense.

444
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,775
I was just kidding.

445
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:12,344
You didn't have to be so serious.

446
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:16,384
The new guy's on the roof as well.

447
00:30:26,049 --> 00:30:27,594
- Hey. - My gosh.

448
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,795
- You startled me. - Sorry.

449
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,360
Did I scare you? That guy with...

450
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,005
the really short hair was here earlier.

451
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:36,160
Are you not hurt?

452
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,559
- No. - Did anything happen?

453
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:40,529
No, but I found something interesting in my room.

454
00:30:40,529 --> 00:30:43,569
Can you just lie low and not do anything?

455
00:30:43,569 --> 00:30:45,038
I didn't do anything.

456
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,314
Is this the guy who used to stay in my room?

457
00:30:49,309 --> 00:30:50,515
Yes.

458
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:51,884
Hang on.

459
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,009
(Identity Card)

460
00:30:54,009 --> 00:30:56,255
He was born in 1984?

461
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:58,925
No way.

462
00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:02,324
I went to my room and...

463
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:05,059
this was on the floor by the end of the bed.

464
00:31:05,059 --> 00:31:07,195
A thought came to me right away.

465
00:31:07,829 --> 00:31:11,100
A guy who went home left his wallet?

466
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,404
With that much cash in it?

467
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:15,475
Don't spend that yet.

468
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:18,170
Why not?

469
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:19,975
He might come back for it.

470
00:31:20,269 --> 00:31:21,470
- No. - Keep it safe.

471
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:24,755
A detective is looking for him too.

472
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:27,455
A detective? Why would...

473
00:31:27,549 --> 00:31:28,850
Just keep it safe.

474
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:31,049
Shouldn't I call the police then?

475
00:31:31,049 --> 00:31:34,064
Will you just keep still and out of everyone's business?

476
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:35,795
Please.

477
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,564
Darn. This really won't work.

478
00:31:41,829 --> 00:31:44,834
I'll move out as soon as I get paid this month.

479
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,374
- You'll leave? - Yes.

480
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:50,775
I hoped to stay at least until I saved up enough for a deposit.

481
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,275
This place won't do.

482
00:31:53,739 --> 00:31:56,814
If you're to move out, won't the rent...

483
00:31:57,170 --> 00:31:58,479
be expensive?

484
00:31:58,479 --> 00:32:00,314
I want to live a decent life.

485
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:04,049
How can I live when a guy stands by my door with a knife?

486
00:32:04,049 --> 00:32:05,279
I guess you're right.

487
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,695
Do you want to come too?

488
00:32:06,749 --> 00:32:08,720
I can't do that. It's not like...

489
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,795
I have a full-time job or salary.

490
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:14,735
I don't have a full-time job. I'm just an intern myself.

491
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:18,735
I get paid less than a rat's bottom, but I'll just move out.

492
00:32:20,059 --> 00:32:24,314
I'd try to stay here a little longer if it weren't for those jerks.

493
00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:29,785
Mom said strangers are the worst, and this place proved it to me.

494
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:34,285
- That's true. - But...

495
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:38,925
how can a whole building be full of just psychos?

496
00:32:39,650 --> 00:32:41,819
It's like they were brought together.

497
00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:44,834
Do you want to know who the worst is?

498
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,935
It's him, the guy we met this morning.

499
00:32:48,029 --> 00:32:49,660
Oh, the guy with long sleeves?

500
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,074
Yes, a black shirt with long sleeves in mid-summer.

501
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:56,169
He calls us "honey" with this spooky smile.

502
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:57,370
Isn't that gross?

503
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:59,370
- Almost melodramatic. - Goodness.

504
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:02,814
I shouldn't say things like this, but the scum here...

505
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:05,610
should all just die in an accident because...

506
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:08,180
- Hey. - They do nothing for society.

507
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,884
- Jong Woo. - What?

508
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,725
What?

509
00:33:19,989 --> 00:33:21,460
See?

510
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:25,705
Isn't it nice to voice everything you feel?

511
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:29,505
Hate the people you want to hate.

512
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:32,245
Curse the people you want to curse.

513
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:35,685
Kill the people you want to kill.

514
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,584
That's true courage.

515
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,525
You might fall.

516
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,994
Did he hear...

517
00:33:53,459 --> 00:33:55,005
I bet he heard.

518
00:33:55,830 --> 00:33:57,575
Yes. I think so.

519
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,660
- Darn. - Hey.

520
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:02,704
He looks so calm and classy,

521
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,669
but he freaks me out for some reason.

522
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:09,684
I told you he's weird. Whatever.

523
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,555
Did you shower?

524
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,049
- Why? - Let's shower together if not.

525
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:19,354
I'm so scared that I wash my hair with my eyes open these days.

526
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,695
Sure. Let's go.

527
00:34:22,549 --> 00:34:24,795
- Let's shower and sleep. - Okay.

528
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,264
It's cold.

529
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,604
It's so cold. This must be paradise.

530
00:34:33,799 --> 00:34:34,945
How cool.

531
00:34:35,299 --> 00:34:37,644
I don't need anything.

532
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:40,244
I don't need anything.

533
00:34:40,470 --> 00:34:42,914
Only I can save myself.

534
00:34:43,669 --> 00:34:45,184
No, that's not it.

535
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:47,215
I don't need anything.

536
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:49,155
Only you can save me.

537
00:34:49,279 --> 00:34:53,124
You're my themed stocks. I am your savior.

538
00:34:56,819 --> 00:34:57,934
What?

539
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:02,905
Hey.

540
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:06,305
Why did you say "themed stocks"?

541
00:35:06,899 --> 00:35:10,244
"Themed stocks"? I was just trying to make things rhyme.

542
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,215
- Do you even know what that means? - No.

543
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:24,525
It's so cool.

544
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:26,180
What? "Themed stocks"?

545
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,250
Why doesn't anyone say "operational stock"?

546
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:30,350
That's lame.

547
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:33,394
An operation that tells us when to move in with the girlfriend.

548
00:35:33,419 --> 00:35:35,505
Don't be so scheming and calculating.

549
00:35:36,029 --> 00:35:38,334
- You're hilarious. - Goodnight.

550
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,945
- Go to bed. - Okay. Sleep well.

551
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:43,505
- Seok Yun. - What?

552
00:35:44,870 --> 00:35:47,144
At least, you know,

553
00:35:48,669 --> 00:35:52,040
now that you're here, this place seems more like a home.

554
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,655
Don't say that. Sleep well.

555
00:35:54,879 --> 00:35:56,025
Thanks.

556
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,854
Themed stock?

557
00:35:59,549 --> 00:36:00,624
Themed stock.

558
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,784
I should've peed then too.

559
00:36:28,609 --> 00:36:30,525
This is so darn inconvenient.

560
00:37:33,622 --> 00:37:35,868
How disgusting.

561
00:37:52,742 --> 00:37:54,387
He's there again with a knife.

562
00:37:55,452 --> 00:37:57,697
I'll take a photo and call the police.

563
00:38:04,363 --> 00:38:05,967
What are you doing there?

564
00:38:06,662 --> 00:38:09,407
Oh. What were you doing?

565
00:38:09,832 --> 00:38:12,903
These eggs? They aren't just for me.

566
00:38:12,903 --> 00:38:14,878
They're nicely cooked. Do you want...

567
00:38:15,102 --> 00:38:17,073
What? Did you see something?

568
00:38:17,073 --> 00:38:18,717
- Ms. Eom. - What?

569
00:38:19,102 --> 00:38:20,403
You ruined it.

570
00:38:20,403 --> 00:38:23,248
- Jong Woo, is something wrong? - Seok Yun.

571
00:38:25,213 --> 00:38:27,257
- What's the matter? - My gosh.

572
00:38:27,883 --> 00:38:31,197
That freak. He had a knife.

573
00:38:31,923 --> 00:38:34,598
He was trying to get into my room with a knife.

574
00:38:34,793 --> 00:38:37,197
- Really? - My gosh, I almost...

575
00:38:38,093 --> 00:38:39,467
I saw him.

576
00:38:40,062 --> 00:38:41,368
I saw it clearly.

577
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,007
I was going to take a photo.

578
00:38:44,863 --> 00:38:46,808
Darn it. Ms. Eom.

579
00:38:47,463 --> 00:38:48,578
Young man.

580
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:52,018
What are you saying?

581
00:38:52,403 --> 00:38:54,912
Are you saying you didn't catch him because of me?

582
00:38:54,912 --> 00:38:56,018
Ms. Eom.

583
00:38:56,412 --> 00:38:58,742
Why did you have to show up then?

584
00:38:58,742 --> 00:39:01,312
If it hadn't been for you, I'd have the photo.

585
00:39:01,312 --> 00:39:04,857
If only I had, then I'd have the proof this time.

586
00:39:05,523 --> 00:39:07,197
- Really? - Darn it.

587
00:39:07,892 --> 00:39:10,892
I should've have taken the photo.

588
00:39:10,892 --> 00:39:12,492
- Are you sure? - Yes.

589
00:39:12,492 --> 00:39:14,237
- Are you positive? - Yes.

590
00:39:14,562 --> 00:39:15,768
Can you swear?

591
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:20,177
Tell me. Can you swear?

592
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,277
Let's go into his room.

593
00:39:26,872 --> 00:39:29,817
He had a knife. Let's see if he has one.

594
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,912
- Hey. - Yes?

595
00:39:31,912 --> 00:39:34,558
You're the witness. Okay?

596
00:39:35,213 --> 00:39:36,288
Okay.

597
00:39:57,432 --> 00:39:59,217
What are you playing at?

598
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:02,288
Do you know how badly you're scaring the others?

599
00:40:02,673 --> 00:40:05,418
Your rent is behind, and you put up women's photos!

600
00:40:05,543 --> 00:40:08,487
Do you know how much you're inconveniencing these men?

601
00:40:11,323 --> 00:40:15,228
I can't go to sleep because of all this noise.

602
00:40:18,062 --> 00:40:19,168
You're smiling?

603
00:40:19,892 --> 00:40:21,368
When I'm talking to you?

604
00:40:21,932 --> 00:40:23,737
You slapped me too hard.

605
00:40:24,432 --> 00:40:25,607
Do you have a grudge?

606
00:40:26,162 --> 00:40:29,547
Search his room. There's a knife in there.

607
00:40:32,142 --> 00:40:33,478
Search his room.

608
00:40:34,673 --> 00:40:37,387
- Me? - Should I then?

609
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:41,757
I should. I'm the general manager.

610
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,027
Look at all this rubbish.

611
00:40:54,193 --> 00:40:58,637
Can we clean up every now and then?

612
00:41:03,173 --> 00:41:06,018
This room stinks like an old man.

613
00:41:07,372 --> 00:41:08,717
Handsome guy.

614
00:41:09,943 --> 00:41:11,487
What if it's not here?

615
00:41:12,483 --> 00:41:13,587
What?

616
00:41:13,843 --> 00:41:17,458
Are your ears blocked up?

617
00:41:18,023 --> 00:41:19,923
What if there's no knife?

618
00:41:19,923 --> 00:41:21,297
Why wouldn't there be?

619
00:41:21,722 --> 00:41:24,293
Look. Because of you,

620
00:41:24,293 --> 00:41:26,898
everyone's up instead of being in bed.

621
00:41:27,062 --> 00:41:28,208
Because of me?

622
00:41:28,762 --> 00:41:31,407
What if this is all a misunderstanding?

623
00:41:31,702 --> 00:41:34,337
- A misunderstanding? - How will you make up for it?

624
00:41:37,472 --> 00:41:38,777
Did you see clearly?

625
00:41:42,843 --> 00:41:45,343
I looked everywhere and I don't see...

626
00:41:45,343 --> 00:41:47,852
- anything. - You'd have it by now if he had it.

627
00:41:47,852 --> 00:41:49,728
There's no knife.

628
00:41:50,012 --> 00:41:51,087
Move.

629
00:41:51,952 --> 00:41:53,098
My gosh.

630
00:41:54,423 --> 00:41:58,768
He has a problem believing people.

631
00:42:04,093 --> 00:42:06,237
My gosh. That chair...

632
00:42:06,602 --> 00:42:07,708
Come on.

633
00:42:12,202 --> 00:42:14,378
Jong Woo. Calm down.

634
00:42:14,673 --> 00:42:16,543
- Calm down, will you? - Let go!

635
00:42:16,543 --> 00:42:19,757
Will you calm down, Jong Woo? Come on, relax.

636
00:42:19,912 --> 00:42:21,483
- Young man. - Relax.

637
00:42:21,483 --> 00:42:24,998
Get your mom to buy you some tonic or something.

638
00:42:25,423 --> 00:42:28,628
You see things when you're weak.

639
00:42:30,793 --> 00:42:31,898
Hey.

640
00:42:33,562 --> 00:42:35,868
- Strip. - Are you crazy?

641
00:42:36,432 --> 00:42:37,693
Strip down.

642
00:42:37,693 --> 00:42:41,202
What's wrong with you? Do you take me for a pushover?

643
00:42:41,202 --> 00:42:42,478
Shall I help you?

644
00:42:44,472 --> 00:42:45,777
Jong Woo, don't.

645
00:42:48,012 --> 00:42:49,217
Take off your clothes.

646
00:42:50,472 --> 00:42:52,188
Before I kill you.

647
00:42:53,142 --> 00:42:54,217
Do it.

648
00:43:07,593 --> 00:43:08,708
My gosh.

649
00:43:24,613 --> 00:43:26,958
I can't be mistaken.

650
00:43:28,983 --> 00:43:31,297
I can't be mistaken.

651
00:44:57,303 --> 00:44:58,702
(Maum Church)

652
00:44:58,702 --> 00:45:00,978
Is it here?

653
00:45:06,343 --> 00:45:07,788
Jong Woo, you are late.

654
00:45:09,682 --> 00:45:11,598
Maybe Jong Woo had a rough weekend too.

655
00:45:11,653 --> 00:45:16,228
You now completely lost your mind, right?

656
00:45:16,452 --> 00:45:19,668
You have no will to work.

657
00:45:20,222 --> 00:45:21,562
I would actually need to meet a man then.

658
00:45:21,562 --> 00:45:23,233
Then try going to a club?

659
00:45:23,233 --> 00:45:24,262
Club?

660
00:45:24,262 --> 00:45:25,337
Maybe not.

661
00:45:25,633 --> 00:45:27,303
- What? - How was your weekend, Mr. Go?

662
00:45:27,303 --> 00:45:28,708
You want to hit me?

663
00:45:30,032 --> 00:45:32,878
Jong Woo, do you need to be disciplined?

664
00:45:33,872 --> 00:45:36,618
I went bowling for the first time in a while.

665
00:45:36,742 --> 00:45:38,288
It's weird, but my back hurts.

666
00:45:38,312 --> 00:45:40,217
You should take vitamins.

667
00:45:40,543 --> 00:45:42,828
You should exercise regularly.

668
00:45:42,983 --> 00:45:45,857
Darn. Only if I had a girlfriend.

669
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:47,558
I would ask her to take care of me.

670
00:45:47,992 --> 00:45:51,637
Hey, Jong Woo. Ji Eun must take good care of you, right?

671
00:45:55,892 --> 00:45:58,378
Shut up, you punk, before I kill you.

672
00:46:06,543 --> 00:46:09,317
Why are you so unfocused today?

673
00:46:09,543 --> 00:46:11,188
Maybe you should go to a sauna.

674
00:46:11,412 --> 00:46:12,688
How about you? Does she take good care of you?

675
00:46:13,043 --> 00:46:14,142
- What is wrong with him? - Well, it's like...

676
00:46:14,142 --> 00:46:15,857
taking 10 vitamin pills every day.

677
00:46:16,053 --> 00:46:18,157
Darn. I want to get married.

678
00:46:19,553 --> 00:46:21,157
Let's do well today too, people!

679
00:46:21,992 --> 00:46:23,653
You should go for a massage.

680
00:46:23,653 --> 00:46:25,368
I think I should go for it today.

681
00:46:39,343 --> 00:46:42,947
You are always smiling,

682
00:46:43,673 --> 00:46:46,157
pretending to be naive and nice,

683
00:46:46,343 --> 00:46:49,688
but badmouthing and looking down on others behind their backs.

684
00:46:49,983 --> 00:46:53,598
Did you think I don't know you?

685
00:46:54,852 --> 00:46:58,098
Going forward,

686
00:46:58,823 --> 00:47:01,837
I have no intention of making peace with you.

687
00:47:02,062 --> 00:47:04,438
Don't ever talk to me again.

688
00:47:05,003 --> 00:47:07,007
Let's see...

689
00:47:07,303 --> 00:47:10,607
who quits the company first. Between you and me.

690
00:47:13,943 --> 00:47:15,188
What?

691
00:47:15,742 --> 00:47:17,418
Get to work.

692
00:47:27,852 --> 00:47:29,598
At that moment, I realized something.

693
00:47:30,153 --> 00:47:33,637
The hell wasn't the studio or the company.

694
00:47:34,323 --> 00:47:36,507
It was the people around me.

695
00:47:43,872 --> 00:47:45,248
Did you know?

696
00:47:45,343 --> 00:47:47,047
This company's CEO is hungry.

697
00:47:47,602 --> 00:47:49,217
- Shall we go for sundae soup? - Good.

698
00:47:49,242 --> 00:47:51,142
No! Why sundae soup again?

699
00:47:51,142 --> 00:47:52,142
What do you want, Jong Woo?

700
00:47:52,142 --> 00:47:53,587
I'll skip it today.

701
00:47:53,843 --> 00:47:56,087
Are you? Fine.

702
00:47:56,452 --> 00:47:57,581
What about you, Byung Min?

703
00:47:57,582 --> 00:47:59,153
- Tonkatsu. - Except for Tonkatsu.

704
00:47:59,153 --> 00:48:00,927
- Then anything. - Let's head out first.

705
00:48:02,053 --> 00:48:03,523
- Any other menu? - Hamburger steak?

706
00:48:03,523 --> 00:48:04,868
Anything but hamburger steak.

707
00:48:04,992 --> 00:48:06,162
Then sundae soup?

708
00:48:06,162 --> 00:48:07,567
Sundae soup sounds good.

709
00:48:17,133 --> 00:48:20,018
(Seok Yun)

710
00:48:21,443 --> 00:48:22,987
- What is it? - Jong Woo.

711
00:48:23,543 --> 00:48:25,757
Just now I went to the kitchen to drink water.

712
00:48:26,082 --> 00:48:28,228
That pervert was staring at me.

713
00:48:29,153 --> 00:48:30,613
And you think that's funny?

714
00:48:30,613 --> 00:48:34,128
No, I really think he's a total nutjob.

715
00:48:34,582 --> 00:48:36,567
He is a nutjob. You need to be careful.

716
00:48:37,053 --> 00:48:38,837
Sure. See you.

717
00:49:06,523 --> 00:49:08,652
Good work today, everyone.

718
00:49:08,653 --> 00:49:10,352
- Good job. - Good work today, Yu Jung.

719
00:49:10,352 --> 00:49:11,467
Thank you.

720
00:49:12,162 --> 00:49:14,237
Jong Woo, are you going home?

721
00:49:16,062 --> 00:49:17,708
Is it because you came late today?

722
00:49:18,233 --> 00:49:19,308
Let's leave together.

723
00:49:19,932 --> 00:49:21,137
Let's just leave.

724
00:50:48,082 --> 00:50:53,297
The days we were together

725
00:50:53,593 --> 00:50:54,697
Hello?

726
00:50:54,793 --> 00:50:56,262
- Jong Woo. - Yes.

727
00:50:56,262 --> 00:50:57,432
Are you still at work?

728
00:50:57,432 --> 00:50:58,737
I just got off.

729
00:50:59,262 --> 00:51:02,708
When you get back, shall we go for ramen and soju?

730
00:51:03,202 --> 00:51:05,217
I think I will be home late today.

731
00:51:06,043 --> 00:51:07,817
I am in a very bad mood today.

732
00:51:07,872 --> 00:51:10,087
If they provoke me, I won't be able to stop myself.

733
00:51:10,412 --> 00:51:12,958
I see. Then I will see you tomorrow.

734
00:51:13,312 --> 00:51:14,788
Sure. You be careful too.

735
00:51:16,153 --> 00:51:17,228
Sure.

736
00:51:20,153 --> 00:51:23,067
(Ji Eun)

737
00:51:24,952 --> 00:51:26,637
(Ji Eun)

738
00:51:29,233 --> 00:51:31,777
- What was that? - He's shooting at you!

739
00:51:33,202 --> 00:51:34,677
- Give it to me. - Is it the same thing?

740
00:51:36,602 --> 00:51:39,618
- Darn! - Are you out of your mind?

741
00:51:39,843 --> 00:51:41,887
- Get me back alive! - Hold on.

742
00:51:42,642 --> 00:51:44,887
- Darn it. - Come on.

743
00:51:47,713 --> 00:51:48,952
Gosh.

744
00:51:48,952 --> 00:51:50,153
- Hey, hey. - Are you dead?

745
00:51:50,153 --> 00:51:51,883
- I am dead because of you. - Just get out.

746
00:51:51,883 --> 00:51:53,153
Stop bothering me.

747
00:51:53,153 --> 00:51:54,797
- Gosh. - Goodness.

748
00:51:54,883 --> 00:51:57,352
What is this? What's going on?

749
00:51:57,352 --> 00:51:59,038
- Let's just do it again. - You should check their age.

750
00:52:00,593 --> 00:52:02,162
Why are you shooting me?

751
00:52:02,162 --> 00:52:03,507
I am going to get you.

752
00:52:05,133 --> 00:52:06,208
Let's go this way.

753
00:52:07,733 --> 00:52:10,348
- There's a person in the front. - The troll is here.

754
00:52:12,343 --> 00:52:14,018
- There's a lot of people. - Hey, boys.

755
00:52:14,202 --> 00:52:15,518
- What? - Hey, hey.

756
00:52:15,713 --> 00:52:17,241
- What? - You should come back tomorrow.

757
00:52:17,242 --> 00:52:19,843
- What? - You should leave. It's past 10 pm.

758
00:52:19,843 --> 00:52:21,043
Let us just finish this game.

759
00:52:21,043 --> 00:52:23,452
It's past your usage time. Turn it off now.

760
00:52:23,452 --> 00:52:25,498
- Why did he... - Come back tomorrow, all right?

761
00:52:28,952 --> 00:52:30,253
- Darn. - Darn!

762
00:52:30,253 --> 00:52:32,222
- He said to turn it off. - Gosh.

763
00:52:32,222 --> 00:52:33,337
Let's turn it off.

764
00:52:34,062 --> 00:52:35,938
If he says to turn it off, we should.

765
00:52:35,963 --> 00:52:37,038
Darn it.

766
00:53:41,523 --> 00:53:42,607
Hey.

767
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:50,733
We are regulars there. Why would you tell on us?

768
00:53:50,733 --> 00:53:52,472
You should have kept your mouth shut and play the game.

769
00:53:52,472 --> 00:53:55,387
Now we don't have places to go because of you.

770
00:53:55,472 --> 00:53:57,688
- You should be held accountable. - You should be.

771
00:53:58,412 --> 00:53:59,817
What am I supposed to do?

772
00:54:00,082 --> 00:54:01,487
- Supposed to do? - Well...

773
00:54:01,912 --> 00:54:04,688
- Maybe you can hang out with us. - That sounds like an idea.

774
00:54:05,222 --> 00:54:06,423
Let's hang out.

775
00:54:06,423 --> 00:54:08,452
It's late. You should head home.

776
00:54:08,452 --> 00:54:10,423
- We don't have a home. - We don't.

777
00:54:10,423 --> 00:54:11,753
Let's go to your place.

778
00:54:11,753 --> 00:54:13,722
That's right! We can go to your place.

779
00:54:13,722 --> 00:54:14,868
Hey!

780
00:54:15,863 --> 00:54:18,007
- You shouldn't do bad things! - Come on.

781
00:54:18,262 --> 00:54:20,133
- Bad things? - Why are you scared?

782
00:54:20,133 --> 00:54:21,578
Don't be scared. Gosh.

783
00:54:21,903 --> 00:54:23,303
- I will feel sorry then. - Why are you scared?

784
00:54:23,303 --> 00:54:25,248
- Act your age. - Maybe because he's small.

785
00:54:25,702 --> 00:54:29,047
- Hey, you old man. - Maybe we can beat him up.

786
00:54:29,972 --> 00:54:31,248
Don't smile like that.

787
00:54:31,642 --> 00:54:33,582
- How should I smile then? - How should I?

788
00:54:33,582 --> 00:54:35,487
- How should we smile? - Smile differently?

789
00:54:36,213 --> 00:54:37,753
- How do we smile differently? - Don't smile like that.

790
00:54:37,753 --> 00:54:40,828
Right. Then let's smile differently.

791
00:54:43,253 --> 00:54:44,527
We will smile differently.

792
00:54:48,392 --> 00:54:49,467
No.

793
00:54:50,293 --> 00:54:51,507
- Darn it. - Gosh.

794
00:54:53,503 --> 00:54:55,878
You are going to kill him.

795
00:55:03,613 --> 00:55:05,918
Please save him.

796
00:55:45,082 --> 00:55:46,757
(Nurture an Advanced Military)

797
00:55:46,952 --> 00:55:49,668
- Sergeant Yun. We have a problem. - What is it?

798
00:55:50,153 --> 00:55:52,737
Sergeant Cho is causing trouble again at the incineration site.

799
00:55:56,032 --> 00:55:58,708
He was so quiet these days. Why is he doing it again?

800
00:55:59,102 --> 00:56:02,102
Can you go and stop him? We are going to get into trouble.

801
00:56:02,102 --> 00:56:03,903
- I need to leave next month but... - I don't want to get involved.

802
00:56:03,903 --> 00:56:06,248
You know he never listens to me.

803
00:56:07,073 --> 00:56:09,418
At least he pretends to listen to you.

804
00:56:09,812 --> 00:56:11,018
I beg you.

805
00:56:12,483 --> 00:56:13,857
Darn it.

806
00:56:15,452 --> 00:56:16,512
Gosh.

807
00:56:16,512 --> 00:56:18,753
If this happened outside, he would have been...

808
00:56:18,753 --> 00:56:19,883
We were in so much trouble because of him.

809
00:56:19,883 --> 00:56:22,998
Where did these crazy people hide outside?

810
00:56:24,593 --> 00:56:27,337
That's enough! Why are you doing this?

811
00:56:27,662 --> 00:56:29,768
Do you want to be locked up in the guardhouse again?

812
00:56:31,733 --> 00:56:35,277
I said stop it! Are you out of your mind?

813
00:56:37,173 --> 00:56:38,308
Jong Woo.

814
00:56:42,343 --> 00:56:44,018
Save me.

815
00:56:50,412 --> 00:56:51,987
You liked him too.

816
00:56:52,722 --> 00:56:53,857
Am I right?

817
00:56:55,352 --> 00:56:57,168
I told you to get out of here as fast as possible.

818
00:56:57,523 --> 00:56:59,038
Don't become crazy like me.

819
00:57:04,093 --> 00:57:05,438
What are you looking at, you punk?

820
00:57:06,363 --> 00:57:07,637
You want to die?

821
00:57:15,202 --> 00:57:17,348
Enough! Enough!

822
00:57:18,713 --> 00:57:20,012
That's enough!

823
00:57:20,012 --> 00:57:22,257
- That's enough, you punk! - Calm down!

824
00:57:26,883 --> 00:57:27,998
Jong Woo.

825
00:57:30,693 --> 00:57:31,828
Save me.

826
00:57:38,733 --> 00:57:39,837
I am sorry.

827
00:57:41,303 --> 00:57:44,248
If I knew this was going to happen, I would have beat him up instead.

828
00:57:45,573 --> 00:57:46,677
Honestly,

829
00:57:48,943 --> 00:57:50,118
I don't regret it.

830
00:57:50,742 --> 00:57:53,257
- What? - I actually feel relieved.

831
00:57:56,282 --> 00:57:58,458
Maybe I should have killed him.

832
00:58:00,523 --> 00:58:01,927
After I am discharged,

833
00:58:02,793 --> 00:58:04,398
I was going to go look for him.

834
00:58:04,492 --> 00:58:06,168
I understand how you feel.

835
00:58:06,963 --> 00:58:09,467
That nutjob deserves the same.

836
00:58:09,863 --> 00:58:12,677
- They'll never get straight. - If we do nothing, those nutjobs...

837
00:58:13,332 --> 00:58:15,407
think that we are afraid of them.

838
00:58:17,332 --> 00:58:19,248
They will come to their senses only after they are beaten up.

839
00:58:19,472 --> 00:58:20,717
You did the right thing.

840
00:58:21,043 --> 00:58:23,348
We will plead as much as we can.

841
00:58:23,512 --> 00:58:27,188
Everyone knows what he's like on this base.

842
00:58:29,952 --> 00:58:31,628
I need to go to the medical office.

843
00:58:32,523 --> 00:58:33,657
Thank you, sir.

844
00:58:50,102 --> 00:58:51,447
I should have killed him.

845
00:59:16,332 --> 00:59:17,467
Are you okay?

846
00:59:30,573 --> 00:59:32,087
You are bleeding.

847
00:59:38,383 --> 00:59:40,797
Don't say anything. You are badly hurt.

848
00:59:46,693 --> 00:59:48,168
Don't worry.

849
00:59:49,093 --> 00:59:50,507
I'll be next to you.

850
01:00:26,602 --> 01:00:28,932
(Stranger from Hell)

851
01:00:28,932 --> 01:00:29,932
Who are you?

852
01:00:29,932 --> 01:00:32,133
Who do you think I really am?

853
01:00:32,133 --> 01:00:33,918
A dentist at the studio?

854
01:00:34,043 --> 01:00:35,812
Or a serial killer?

855
01:00:35,812 --> 01:00:38,742
Contact me immediately if anything happens.

856
01:00:38,742 --> 01:00:40,543
Just leave me alone.

857
01:00:40,543 --> 01:00:42,257
Have I ever told you?

858
01:00:42,553 --> 01:00:44,887
If I have a target, I never let it go.

859
01:00:45,113 --> 01:00:46,297
Are you okay?

860
01:00:47,352 --> 01:00:48,898
If you want to kill him, then do so.

861
01:00:50,193 --> 01:00:51,868
That's who you really are.

862
01:00:52,193 --> 01:00:54,498
Why did you meet Ji Eun?

863
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:57,168
You need to move out.
