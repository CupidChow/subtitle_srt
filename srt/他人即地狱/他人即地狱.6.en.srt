1
00:00:16,868 --> 00:00:20,037
(All places, names, organizations, groups...)

2
00:00:20,037 --> 00:00:22,783
(and religions in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:27,307 --> 00:00:30,652
You were a failure.

4
00:00:30,777 --> 00:00:34,093
I'm creating art. It's not just murder.

5
00:00:36,387 --> 00:00:38,562
Is he really the replacement for Unit 302?

6
00:00:38,917 --> 00:00:41,957
Don't judge a book by its cover.

7
00:00:41,957 --> 00:00:43,903
That man is scary.

8
00:00:44,198 --> 00:00:46,373
How about some beer after work tonight?

9
00:00:46,728 --> 00:00:49,543
I'm actually meeting my girlfriend tonight.

10
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:50,913
You have a girlfriend?

11
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:52,812
Right. Since you're so handsome.

12
00:00:55,838 --> 00:00:57,008
Try it.

13
00:00:57,008 --> 00:00:58,182
Why are you so startled?

14
00:01:00,177 --> 00:01:01,983
Gosh, I guess he's sensitive.

15
00:01:02,277 --> 00:01:03,548
It's just my taste.

16
00:01:03,548 --> 00:01:05,823
You really wanted to kill the man back there, didn't you?

17
00:01:05,987 --> 00:01:07,787
- What? - You got a chill of fear,

18
00:01:07,787 --> 00:01:10,957
thinking that the pervert who watches weird videos alone...

19
00:01:10,957 --> 00:01:12,828
broke into your room...

20
00:01:12,828 --> 00:01:15,433
and touched your stuff, right?

21
00:01:15,558 --> 00:01:18,573
You think you don't fit this place, right?

22
00:01:19,168 --> 00:01:21,302
You think you're different.

23
00:01:21,927 --> 00:01:23,472
But you're scared at the same time.

24
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:25,543
You're worried that you'll become like one of them.

25
00:01:26,108 --> 00:01:29,213
You must be worried that just by living here...

26
00:01:29,477 --> 00:01:31,552
would make you become just as weird.

27
00:01:32,477 --> 00:01:34,222
Should I kill him?

28
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,323
- He laughed. - What?

29
00:01:37,548 --> 00:01:40,862
He didn't look oppressed. He seemed to enjoy it.

30
00:01:41,287 --> 00:01:42,662
Sir.

31
00:01:43,358 --> 00:01:45,192
Can I get off here?

32
00:01:45,617 --> 00:01:47,562
I don't want to go there.

33
00:01:48,388 --> 00:01:51,133
Sorry, I should go to Jong Woo.

34
00:01:51,998 --> 00:01:53,073
Sir,

35
00:01:53,597 --> 00:01:55,343
can you make a u-turn over there?

36
00:02:03,177 --> 00:02:04,812
Wake him up.

37
00:02:13,317 --> 00:02:14,392
Jong Woo.

38
00:02:15,588 --> 00:02:17,763
Jong Woo. Jong Woo.

39
00:02:18,387 --> 00:02:19,503
Jong Woo...

40
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,133
Are you okay?

41
00:02:26,398 --> 00:02:27,872
Eden Studio.

42
00:02:29,738 --> 00:02:32,272
What's going on over there?

43
00:02:50,387 --> 00:02:51,832
I am scared.

44
00:02:54,558 --> 00:02:55,703
I am...

45
00:02:58,327 --> 00:02:59,443
really scared.

46
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:07,082
The residents of that studio...

47
00:03:09,678 --> 00:03:11,313
are all very strange.

48
00:03:22,718 --> 00:03:25,533
(Jong Woo, I am at the studio. I'll go to your room.)

49
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:27,033
Ji Eun!

50
00:03:37,767 --> 00:03:38,973
Can I help you?

51
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:40,682
Pardon?

52
00:03:41,868 --> 00:03:43,052
Who are you?

53
00:03:45,577 --> 00:03:47,152
Please don't get the wrong idea. I live here.

54
00:03:48,507 --> 00:03:49,753
Are you here to meet someone?

55
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:53,293
I'm here to meet my boyfriend.

56
00:03:54,417 --> 00:03:55,892
You came to see Jong Woo.

57
00:03:57,158 --> 00:03:58,233
Yes.

58
00:03:59,628 --> 00:04:01,462
How did you know?

59
00:04:01,757 --> 00:04:02,902
We're close.

60
00:04:04,398 --> 00:04:06,503
You're pretty as he described.

61
00:04:09,898 --> 00:04:11,672
It sounded like he cherishes you a lot.

62
00:04:13,468 --> 00:04:15,813
Did he tell you that?

63
00:04:15,978 --> 00:04:17,183
What did he say?

64
00:04:17,837 --> 00:04:19,683
What did he say about the people who live here?

65
00:04:20,707 --> 00:04:21,823
Well...

66
00:04:22,007 --> 00:04:25,553
Anyway, I think the people here aren't normal.

67
00:04:26,548 --> 00:04:30,532
He just said people here were nice.

68
00:04:32,257 --> 00:04:33,503
"Nice people"?

69
00:04:37,628 --> 00:04:40,373
You should go up. The guys all live on the third floor.

70
00:04:40,728 --> 00:04:41,803
Okay.

71
00:04:46,637 --> 00:04:51,782
(Episode 6, Lost)

72
00:04:56,817 --> 00:04:58,577
- Please reply. - Don't worry too much.

73
00:04:58,577 --> 00:04:59,892
I'm sure she's fine.

74
00:05:01,647 --> 00:05:03,693
Just reply, will you?

75
00:05:05,217 --> 00:05:06,633
Ji Eun.

76
00:05:07,027 --> 00:05:09,703
The number you have called is turned off.

77
00:05:10,128 --> 00:05:11,128
What's wrong?

78
00:05:11,128 --> 00:05:12,642
Her phone's off.

79
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:14,673
What's going on?

80
00:05:15,168 --> 00:05:16,972
Darn it.

81
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:40,003
What is this? My gosh.

82
00:05:52,707 --> 00:05:54,443
Who's here so late at night?

83
00:05:55,738 --> 00:05:57,113
Hello.

84
00:05:57,207 --> 00:06:00,978
I'm here to meet Yun Jong Woo, a resident here.

85
00:06:00,978 --> 00:06:03,292
Oh, that handsome guy?

86
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,123
You must be his girlfriend.

87
00:06:05,317 --> 00:06:06,462
Yes.

88
00:06:06,517 --> 00:06:08,923
Did he come home?

89
00:06:09,217 --> 00:06:11,292
I don't think so.

90
00:06:12,358 --> 00:06:13,757
Thank you.

91
00:06:13,757 --> 00:06:14,832
Hold on.

92
00:06:15,257 --> 00:06:17,573
Gosh, your hand is dirty.

93
00:06:17,628 --> 00:06:19,298
Come in and wash your hands.

94
00:06:19,298 --> 00:06:21,327
No, I'm fine.

95
00:06:21,327 --> 00:06:23,598
Come on. Wash your hands.

96
00:06:23,598 --> 00:06:25,567
You'll hold your boyfriend's hand, won't you?

97
00:06:25,567 --> 00:06:26,707
Come on in.

98
00:06:26,707 --> 00:06:28,267
- I'm really fine. - Make yourself at home.

99
00:06:28,267 --> 00:06:29,613
- I'm really fine. - Come on.

100
00:06:42,587 --> 00:06:44,662
Ji Eun! Ji Eun!

101
00:06:45,587 --> 00:06:46,832
Ji Eun!

102
00:06:49,858 --> 00:06:51,032
Did you find her?

103
00:06:53,798 --> 00:06:55,197
Die!

104
00:06:55,197 --> 00:06:56,313
- Ji Eun. - Die!

105
00:06:56,897 --> 00:06:58,697
Ji Eun. Ji Eun!

106
00:06:58,697 --> 00:06:59,782
Jung Hwa.

107
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:06,623
Why won't you pick up?

108
00:07:07,178 --> 00:07:08,883
- Wait. - Ji Eun.

109
00:07:09,108 --> 00:07:10,423
What is this?

110
00:07:10,717 --> 00:07:12,577
Why are you here with them?

111
00:07:12,577 --> 00:07:14,892
Why haven't you been picking up? Why have you arrived just now?

112
00:07:15,118 --> 00:07:17,858
First, let's go outside.

113
00:07:17,858 --> 00:07:19,317
Hey, Jong Woo.

114
00:07:19,317 --> 00:07:21,527
Do you think we did something wrong?

115
00:07:21,527 --> 00:07:23,203
What's wrong? You're scaring me.

116
00:07:23,928 --> 00:07:26,697
- Why are the cops here? - No.

117
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,067
That's not right.

118
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:29,203
Come on out.

119
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:30,613
Hurry.

120
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:32,267
Let me go.

121
00:07:32,267 --> 00:07:35,168
This isn't right!

122
00:07:35,168 --> 00:07:37,637
She washed her hands and was waiting... My gosh.

123
00:07:37,637 --> 00:07:39,883
- I'm at a loss for words. - Darn it!

124
00:07:41,748 --> 00:07:44,453
Ji Eun, are you okay?

125
00:07:47,288 --> 00:07:48,462
Ji Eun.

126
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:53,757
Why would you go in there all alone?

127
00:07:53,757 --> 00:07:56,303
I told you...

128
00:07:56,327 --> 00:07:58,402
how dangerous these people were.

129
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:00,402
Jong Woo.

130
00:08:01,598 --> 00:08:05,212
I'll take you home. Let's go.

131
00:08:05,438 --> 00:08:06,738
- I can go alone. - Come on.

132
00:08:06,738 --> 00:08:07,738
We can...

133
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,407
- drive you. - No, we can go ourselves.

134
00:08:09,407 --> 00:08:10,782
Let me go.

135
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:13,953
Ji Eun.

136
00:08:16,118 --> 00:08:17,553
Jong Woo.

137
00:08:18,817 --> 00:08:20,592
There are so many people...

138
00:08:21,217 --> 00:08:24,392
who are stranger than them although they don't appear to be.

139
00:08:25,618 --> 00:08:28,032
These people are fine.

140
00:08:28,628 --> 00:08:30,598
You're only saying that because you don't live here.

141
00:08:30,598 --> 00:08:32,527
If you stay here for just one day,

142
00:08:32,527 --> 00:08:33,628
then you'll know that...

143
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:35,198
Then leave this place!

144
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:37,273
Why are you still here?

145
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:44,752
I'm sorry.

146
00:08:45,838 --> 00:08:47,582
Let's talk again tomorrow.

147
00:08:48,708 --> 00:08:50,122
I'll go home alone.

148
00:08:57,657 --> 00:09:00,203
We'll take her home safely.

149
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,262
We will.

150
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:04,533
(Police)

151
00:09:18,277 --> 00:09:20,953
Your boyfriend was worried sick.

152
00:09:22,007 --> 00:09:24,092
That's why we came.

153
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:44,097
Hello.

154
00:09:44,098 --> 00:09:45,198
Hello.

155
00:09:45,198 --> 00:09:47,267
Did something happen? I saw the cops.

156
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:48,813
It was nothing.

157
00:09:49,108 --> 00:09:52,183
It's the weekend tomorrow. Do you want to grab a drink?

158
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:54,348
We can talk about that novel you're writing.

159
00:09:54,348 --> 00:09:56,393
I promised to meet my girlfriend.

160
00:10:03,287 --> 00:10:04,663
("The Metamorphosis")

161
00:10:51,698 --> 00:10:53,313
Hey, Jong Woo.

162
00:10:53,968 --> 00:10:55,913
Can you open up for a second?

163
00:10:58,507 --> 00:10:59,752
Hey.

164
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:03,118
- What is it? - Good. You weren't sleeping.

165
00:11:03,118 --> 00:11:04,517
How's your hangover? Are you okay?

166
00:11:04,517 --> 00:11:05,617
I'm fine.

167
00:11:05,618 --> 00:11:08,588
Drink this.

168
00:11:08,588 --> 00:11:11,417
- I'm fine. - This will cure your hangover...

169
00:11:11,417 --> 00:11:12,533
right away.

170
00:11:13,228 --> 00:11:15,102
Drink up.

171
00:11:16,728 --> 00:11:18,673
Did your girlfriend go home safely?

172
00:11:21,198 --> 00:11:23,372
Yes. By the way,

173
00:11:24,167 --> 00:11:27,608
only men live in this building.

174
00:11:27,608 --> 00:11:31,007
So please don't allow her to enter all alone.

175
00:11:31,007 --> 00:11:34,323
You're hurting my feelings.

176
00:11:34,348 --> 00:11:35,848
Don't act that way.

177
00:11:35,848 --> 00:11:36,848
What do you mean?

178
00:11:36,848 --> 00:11:39,118
I told you last time...

179
00:11:39,118 --> 00:11:41,523
that only the good people are left.

180
00:11:41,718 --> 00:11:43,517
You can't have such a misunderstanding...

181
00:11:43,517 --> 00:11:44,818
- while living together. - I'm just asking you...

182
00:11:44,818 --> 00:11:46,328
- to be careful. - Your neighbors will be hurt too.

183
00:11:46,328 --> 00:11:48,163
- Please be careful. - I'm hurt too.

184
00:11:58,838 --> 00:12:00,183
I'm dizzy.

185
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,683
Did she spike the drink?

186
00:12:03,307 --> 00:12:04,712
This won't do.

187
00:12:04,978 --> 00:12:06,953
I need to move out.

188
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:11,023
Right. I shouldn't stay here.

189
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:17,693
I shouldn't fall asleep before Ji Eun gets home.

190
00:12:28,828 --> 00:12:30,842
Wasn't that man strange?

191
00:12:31,338 --> 00:12:32,612
Who?

192
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,082
The man who came to our station.

193
00:12:35,437 --> 00:12:39,053
He was talking nonsense and seemed a bit strange.

194
00:12:41,547 --> 00:12:44,077
Do you know why people turn strange?

195
00:12:44,078 --> 00:12:45,293
What?

196
00:12:46,017 --> 00:12:48,017
It's not that they're strange to begin with,

197
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,962
but those around them make them become that way.

198
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:54,588
If people around you keep saying that you're insane when you're not,

199
00:12:54,588 --> 00:12:56,403
do you think you'll remain sane?

200
00:12:57,328 --> 00:12:59,502
That's true but...

201
00:13:01,568 --> 00:13:02,773
Didn't you say that...

202
00:13:02,968 --> 00:13:05,043
you've lived in this neighborhood for a long time?

203
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:07,738
Well, I didn't live for that long.

204
00:13:07,738 --> 00:13:09,183
I was born here.

205
00:13:10,637 --> 00:13:13,207
Then do you know anything about that studio apartment?

206
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,252
Not much, really.

207
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:19,053
But before you joined us, there was a big fire there.

208
00:13:19,647 --> 00:13:22,217
So they were going to close down.

209
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,492
But after her husband died, the lady ran the place by herself.

210
00:13:25,988 --> 00:13:28,962
There aren't many people here since they're redeveloping the area.

211
00:13:29,427 --> 00:13:31,472
I'm not sure if she makes much money.

212
00:13:33,698 --> 00:13:36,742
Many friends around me live in studio apartments...

213
00:13:37,368 --> 00:13:39,882
while preparing to become police officers.

214
00:13:42,807 --> 00:13:46,078
Usually, the residents don't even look at each other.

215
00:13:46,078 --> 00:13:48,578
It's their rule.

216
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:50,423
They're aware that others are living there,

217
00:13:50,448 --> 00:13:54,293
but they do their best to respect each other's privacy and stay quiet.

218
00:13:54,647 --> 00:13:57,332
But the residents back there weren't like that at all.

219
00:13:57,557 --> 00:13:58,693
Jung Hwa.

220
00:13:58,988 --> 00:14:02,858
Since they're so small-scale, perhaps, they're like a family.

221
00:14:02,858 --> 00:14:05,533
Did they seem like a family to you?

222
00:14:11,738 --> 00:14:15,342
I'm sick and tired of killing cats.

223
00:14:16,537 --> 00:14:18,313
Is this what we're here for?

224
00:14:19,537 --> 00:14:21,752
Don't be ridiculous.

225
00:14:21,848 --> 00:14:24,578
If you keep talking like that,

226
00:14:24,578 --> 00:14:26,793
you'll die like that guy...

227
00:14:26,818 --> 00:14:29,488
in Unit 302.

228
00:14:29,488 --> 00:14:32,132
Do you think I'm like that scumbag?

229
00:14:33,828 --> 00:14:36,227
You just wait and see.

230
00:14:36,228 --> 00:14:39,803
I will kill him immediately.

231
00:14:41,368 --> 00:14:43,643
Don't be ridiculous.

232
00:14:43,797 --> 00:14:46,073
I know you're both intimidated by him.

233
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,637
Don't you know the saying,

234
00:14:50,637 --> 00:14:53,323
"Look before..."

235
00:14:53,448 --> 00:14:55,323
"you leap"?

236
00:14:55,748 --> 00:14:58,252
We have an advantage since there's more of us.

237
00:15:00,218 --> 00:15:02,923
You, your brother and I.

238
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:06,232
And we can just leave out Ms. Eom.

239
00:15:07,387 --> 00:15:09,163
Hilarious.

240
00:15:10,297 --> 00:15:12,832
I don't think you know this,

241
00:15:13,198 --> 00:15:17,338
but the scariest person in this studio...

242
00:15:17,338 --> 00:15:20,543
is Ms. Eom.

243
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:37,358
He was all alone...

244
00:15:37,358 --> 00:15:38,933
How's the guy in Unit 303?

245
00:15:39,927 --> 00:15:42,057
There's a small bridge on one side...

246
00:15:42,057 --> 00:15:43,803
You know,

247
00:15:44,858 --> 00:15:47,773
- flies keep flocking around us. - The other bridge is...

248
00:15:48,468 --> 00:15:51,643
Don't you think it's time for us to pack up and leave now?

249
00:15:54,137 --> 00:15:56,953
Ms. Eom, I don't know what you're talking about.

250
00:15:57,807 --> 00:16:00,482
You know.

251
00:16:01,307 --> 00:16:02,783
I raised you, so you know.

252
00:16:04,848 --> 00:16:08,023
You failed once with Unit 302.

253
00:16:32,277 --> 00:16:34,208
I can do it for sure this time.

254
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,393
Don't worry and sit back.

255
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:44,663
I don't worry.

256
00:16:47,128 --> 00:16:50,173
I can kill them all if you fail, I have no worries.

257
00:16:57,568 --> 00:16:58,673
Jong Woo.

258
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:03,282
Jong Woo.

259
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:24,173
Ji Eun.

260
00:17:25,028 --> 00:17:26,133
Ji Eun.

261
00:17:45,278 --> 00:17:47,722
Bet your life on it.

262
00:17:48,018 --> 00:17:49,123
Ji Eun!

263
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:52,062
I told you to not come here!

264
00:17:52,387 --> 00:17:53,732
She's dead.

265
00:17:56,927 --> 00:17:58,032
Ji Eun?

266
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:27,532
This is driving me crazy, I'm having nightmares every night.

267
00:19:26,987 --> 00:19:28,992
What's this pervert doing?

268
00:19:29,288 --> 00:19:31,933
Do you have something to say to me?

269
00:19:38,997 --> 00:19:40,643
Do you have something to say to me?

270
00:19:43,697 --> 00:19:46,697
Darn it. So disgusting.

271
00:19:46,697 --> 00:19:47,843
Hey.

272
00:19:48,608 --> 00:19:49,982
Just be honest.

273
00:19:51,937 --> 00:19:53,282
Ask me to kill you if you'd like.

274
00:19:54,947 --> 00:19:57,593
I'd do it for you in a heartbeat.

275
00:20:05,987 --> 00:20:07,062
Hey!

276
00:20:07,758 --> 00:20:08,903
Kill me.

277
00:20:09,628 --> 00:20:10,703
Kill me.

278
00:20:11,358 --> 00:20:12,532
Do it.

279
00:20:13,497 --> 00:20:16,242
Kill me if you can. Kill me!

280
00:20:17,197 --> 00:20:18,613
You thought I'd get scared?

281
00:20:19,098 --> 00:20:20,583
Kill me. Try.

282
00:20:24,207 --> 00:20:25,853
What a crazy man.

283
00:20:26,177 --> 00:20:28,222
Gosh. Hey!

284
00:20:29,548 --> 00:20:31,292
That crazy man.

285
00:20:33,378 --> 00:20:35,987
Is there something fun going on?

286
00:20:35,987 --> 00:20:37,462
What are you doing?

287
00:20:39,058 --> 00:20:40,903
Shut up, you lunatic.

288
00:20:44,558 --> 00:20:46,072
Did you...

289
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:50,972
just call me a lunatic?

290
00:20:53,038 --> 00:20:55,282
Just what are you trying to do?

291
00:20:57,078 --> 00:20:58,183
What?

292
00:21:15,258 --> 00:21:17,302
Should we get to it now?

293
00:21:17,957 --> 00:21:19,072
What?

294
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:24,173
Talk.

295
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:27,413
I guess you forgot again.

296
00:21:29,068 --> 00:21:31,552
I don't think this is going to end by yelling at each other like this.

297
00:21:32,177 --> 00:21:34,482
Do you mind if Unit 303 and I have a talk?

298
00:21:35,348 --> 00:21:38,653
Let's stop now, it's not fun anymore.

299
00:21:38,947 --> 00:21:41,722
Everyone is just getting frustrated now.

300
00:21:43,217 --> 00:21:45,288
You keep talking weird...

301
00:21:45,288 --> 00:21:47,427
and that's why Unit 303 keeps getting creeped out.

302
00:21:47,427 --> 00:21:50,972
I think you're the weird man here.

303
00:22:08,608 --> 00:22:11,022
I smiled and spoke to you nicely.

304
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:12,923
Do you think I'm a joke?

305
00:22:14,848 --> 00:22:17,792
What? You want to fight me?

306
00:22:20,328 --> 00:22:22,163
Please...

307
00:22:23,288 --> 00:22:24,532
don't get mad.

308
00:22:24,727 --> 00:22:28,002
Smiles bring happiness.

309
00:22:29,197 --> 00:22:31,843
Let's all smile.

310
00:22:33,707 --> 00:22:35,943
Apologize to him.

311
00:22:38,677 --> 00:22:41,482
Sorry, I was just bored.

312
00:22:43,078 --> 00:22:45,393
He was...

313
00:22:46,917 --> 00:22:48,992
just bored.

314
00:22:55,187 --> 00:22:56,762
- Let's go. - Okay.

315
00:23:03,328 --> 00:23:05,843
It's not as hot today, is it?

316
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,613
What do you want to say to me?

317
00:23:11,778 --> 00:23:13,153
Nothing, really.

318
00:23:13,707 --> 00:23:15,853
I wanted to just break up the fight since everyone seemed upset.

319
00:23:17,417 --> 00:23:19,653
Why were you arguing with them back there?

320
00:23:20,247 --> 00:23:22,193
The man said he wants to kill me.

321
00:23:24,917 --> 00:23:26,633
He's weird, isn't he?

322
00:23:28,727 --> 00:23:30,497
According to Ms. Eom, it's all because...

323
00:23:30,497 --> 00:23:33,103
he failed his business in China.

324
00:23:35,727 --> 00:23:38,643
But I think the reason he was going at you like that today...

325
00:23:39,467 --> 00:23:42,282
was because you got drunk and was making a scene last night.

326
00:23:43,467 --> 00:23:44,477
What?

327
00:23:44,477 --> 00:23:46,853
What is he talking about?

328
00:23:47,848 --> 00:23:50,893
You don't remember, do you? You were too drunk.

329
00:23:52,447 --> 00:23:56,292
You were screaming and cursing in the hallway, drunk.

330
00:23:56,417 --> 00:23:59,133
You were knocking on everyone's doors and all.

331
00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:01,603
Me? I did that?

332
00:24:03,487 --> 00:24:05,703
Check the surveillance camera if you can't believe me.

333
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:07,143
It's probably all taped.

334
00:24:13,237 --> 00:24:15,012
But that was better.

335
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:17,252
What?

336
00:24:18,137 --> 00:24:21,083
It's better to say what you want...

337
00:24:21,907 --> 00:24:23,653
and act how you'd like...

338
00:24:24,118 --> 00:24:25,722
rather than bottling it all up within yourself.

339
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:28,123
That's more human, don't you think?

340
00:24:31,858 --> 00:24:34,562
I'm going to head down first, you come down when you're calm.

341
00:24:51,637 --> 00:24:55,022
Jong Woo, a bad article got published after yesterday's show.

342
00:24:55,477 --> 00:24:58,292
We'll have to meet at night. Is that okay with you?

343
00:24:59,977 --> 00:25:01,762
(Yes, I don't...)

344
00:25:02,118 --> 00:25:05,957
Yes, I don't mind. Finish up well and see you later.

345
00:25:05,957 --> 00:25:09,002
(Finish up well and see you later.)

346
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,897
Where did I put it last time?

347
00:25:14,897 --> 00:25:17,343
- Ms. Eom. - Yes, come in.

348
00:25:17,937 --> 00:25:20,472
Can I see the surveillance camera footage?

349
00:25:21,038 --> 00:25:22,407
You want to see it again?

350
00:25:22,407 --> 00:25:26,378
Yes. The guy in Unit 304 said I caused a fuss last night.

351
00:25:26,378 --> 00:25:28,322
I don't remember a thing.

352
00:25:28,747 --> 00:25:30,522
- You sure about that? - Yes.

353
00:25:36,217 --> 00:25:37,292
What?

354
00:25:40,018 --> 00:25:41,163
When...

355
00:25:47,727 --> 00:25:48,873
Gosh.

356
00:25:55,108 --> 00:25:56,883
Stop staring at me.

357
00:25:57,308 --> 00:25:58,583
Hey.

358
00:25:59,278 --> 00:26:01,308
- You. - If you're drunk,

359
00:26:01,308 --> 00:26:04,453
- go and sleep it off. - Live like a decent human being.

360
00:26:04,848 --> 00:26:06,153
Do you want me to kill you?

361
00:26:06,578 --> 00:26:10,562
Be more like a human, you pervert.

362
00:26:11,118 --> 00:26:12,562
Hey.

363
00:26:13,657 --> 00:26:16,732
I know what happens to jerks like you.

364
00:26:22,268 --> 00:26:23,502
Humans...

365
00:26:24,568 --> 00:26:25,997
It's late.

366
00:26:25,997 --> 00:26:27,637
- Why... - Be quiet!

367
00:26:27,637 --> 00:26:30,583
Why are you making so much noise?

368
00:26:32,308 --> 00:26:35,083
You're so noisy.

369
00:26:42,217 --> 00:26:44,462
You lunatic.

370
00:26:46,788 --> 00:26:48,227
You punk!

371
00:26:48,227 --> 00:26:51,858
Jong Woo! He'd been asking to see the surveillance camera footage.

372
00:26:51,858 --> 00:26:53,897
- Now look at him. - Go to sleep.

373
00:26:53,897 --> 00:26:55,167
What a temper.

374
00:26:55,167 --> 00:26:56,903
- Sleep! - My goodness.

375
00:26:57,737 --> 00:26:59,268
- Gosh. - The lunatic.

376
00:26:59,268 --> 00:27:00,812
What is it now?

377
00:27:02,268 --> 00:27:03,782
Hey, you.

378
00:27:04,207 --> 00:27:05,482
You.

379
00:27:07,378 --> 00:27:10,183
Don't smile!

380
00:27:13,578 --> 00:27:14,962
Don't smile.

381
00:27:19,717 --> 00:27:21,133
Calm down.

382
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,603
You calm down.

383
00:27:34,707 --> 00:27:35,982
Guess what?

384
00:27:45,318 --> 00:27:46,853
Out of all the people here,

385
00:27:50,048 --> 00:27:52,333
you're the creepiest.

386
00:27:58,657 --> 00:28:01,143
Get out of his way.

387
00:28:02,598 --> 00:28:04,772
You're very angry today.

388
00:28:15,677 --> 00:28:16,953
Are you okay?

389
00:28:18,378 --> 00:28:21,792
Men are like that sometimes when they get drunk.

390
00:28:23,548 --> 00:28:25,663
I preferred that.

391
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:27,663
What?

392
00:28:29,028 --> 00:28:31,673
It's better to say what you want...

393
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,242
and act how you'd like...

394
00:28:34,328 --> 00:28:36,242
rather than bottling it all up within yourself.

395
00:28:36,828 --> 00:28:38,512
That's more human, don't you think?

396
00:28:40,167 --> 00:28:41,812
Okay, so...

397
00:28:42,568 --> 00:28:45,176
If I have to move out due to personal reasons,

398
00:28:45,177 --> 00:28:47,947
can you give me back half the rent I paid?

399
00:28:47,947 --> 00:28:50,207
Why do you want to leave?

400
00:28:50,207 --> 00:28:53,292
I want to live closer to work...

401
00:28:53,318 --> 00:28:55,792
Never mind. Thanks anyway.

402
00:28:57,943 --> 00:29:02,387
Hello? We sent out an official explanation this morning.

403
00:29:03,063 --> 00:29:04,278
Yes.

404
00:29:04,763 --> 00:29:07,507
It was sent already. Check your inbox.

405
00:29:08,073 --> 00:29:09,247
Bye.

406
00:29:11,372 --> 00:29:12,618
Ji Eun.

407
00:29:13,573 --> 00:29:14,917
Jae Ho.

408
00:29:17,513 --> 00:29:19,017
What are you doing here?

409
00:29:19,743 --> 00:29:22,657
I couldn't reach you and I got worried.

410
00:29:22,852 --> 00:29:24,157
About me?

411
00:29:24,422 --> 00:29:25,628
What?

412
00:29:25,983 --> 00:29:28,028
Yes. Both of you.

413
00:29:28,253 --> 00:29:29,328
Where's Jong Woo?

414
00:29:31,563 --> 00:29:34,167
I dropped him off at the studio.

415
00:29:35,263 --> 00:29:37,507
I think he's having a hard time...

416
00:29:37,662 --> 00:29:39,737
getting used to life in Seoul.

417
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:41,907
Oh, dear.

418
00:29:42,503 --> 00:29:44,747
I thought the same too.

419
00:29:45,003 --> 00:29:46,902
He's always picking a fight.

420
00:29:46,902 --> 00:29:48,348
- What? - Darn it.

421
00:29:48,842 --> 00:29:53,058
He almost got into huge trouble at a bar.

422
00:29:53,243 --> 00:29:55,388
My gosh.

423
00:29:55,412 --> 00:29:56,727
I had...

424
00:29:57,112 --> 00:29:59,253
a really tough time sorting that out.

425
00:29:59,253 --> 00:30:01,692
That was great of you.

426
00:30:01,692 --> 00:30:04,267
Look out for him for a while.

427
00:30:04,862 --> 00:30:06,298
Oh, well.

428
00:30:07,662 --> 00:30:11,263
He keeps trying to fight his senior at work too.

429
00:30:11,263 --> 00:30:12,432
His supervisor?

430
00:30:12,432 --> 00:30:13,578
Yes.

431
00:30:14,273 --> 00:30:15,872
Why does he keep doing that?

432
00:30:15,872 --> 00:30:17,378
I feel bad.

433
00:30:17,872 --> 00:30:19,473
I made him move here.

434
00:30:19,473 --> 00:30:21,348
Don't think like that.

435
00:30:21,473 --> 00:30:24,257
Let's give him some time. He'll get better.

436
00:30:24,342 --> 00:30:25,588
What are you doing tomorrow?

437
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:30,558
I'm meeting Jong Woo. For a chat.

438
00:30:32,382 --> 00:30:33,497
What about Sunday?

439
00:30:34,622 --> 00:30:36,128
I don't have plans.

440
00:30:36,223 --> 00:30:39,197
Good. Let's meet up and talk about this.

441
00:30:39,323 --> 00:30:40,661
About what?

442
00:30:40,662 --> 00:30:44,237
Jong Woo's in a bad place. He could get into real trouble.

443
00:30:45,332 --> 00:30:47,872
Okay, I'll ask him. Let's talk.

444
00:30:47,872 --> 00:30:50,308
No, don't tell him. Let's keep it between us.

445
00:30:50,533 --> 00:30:52,648
- What? - He'll only get upset.

446
00:30:53,703 --> 00:30:56,112
I'll ask him and call you.

447
00:30:56,112 --> 00:30:57,743
Jong Woo's giving me a hard time.

448
00:30:57,743 --> 00:31:00,288
Okay, I'll call you. Bye.

449
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:02,513
See you on the weekend.

450
00:31:02,513 --> 00:31:04,257
I'll call you.

451
00:31:04,682 --> 00:31:06,328
Ji Eun.

452
00:31:06,553 --> 00:31:08,122
I'm off to a meeting.

453
00:31:08,122 --> 00:31:09,568
Okay.

454
00:31:10,422 --> 00:31:13,798
Why haven't you arranged a date for me and that guy?

455
00:31:15,263 --> 00:31:17,507
He said he's a little busy.

456
00:31:18,233 --> 00:31:20,762
Are you keeping him to yourself?

457
00:31:20,763 --> 00:31:22,007
What?

458
00:31:22,432 --> 00:31:24,618
You know what I mean.

459
00:31:24,902 --> 00:31:26,378
See you later.

460
00:31:36,379 --> 00:31:41,379
<font color="#fcc89b">[VIU Ver] OCN E06 'Stranger from Hell'</font>

<font color="#ff5fa2">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

461
00:31:51,602 --> 00:31:55,108
Grandma. What was Grandpa like?

462
00:31:56,733 --> 00:32:00,003
He was nice. He was always nice.

463
00:32:00,003 --> 00:32:03,141
How can someone always be nice?

464
00:32:03,142 --> 00:32:05,983
My husband was like that.

465
00:32:05,983 --> 00:32:09,851
As long as you believe someone is nice and kind,

466
00:32:09,852 --> 00:32:13,197
then that person will be nicer and kinder...

467
00:32:13,253 --> 00:32:17,227
than you believe. That's what he told me.

468
00:32:39,142 --> 00:32:41,157
He left his door open again.

469
00:33:02,503 --> 00:33:05,517
He's really trash. Utter trash.

470
00:33:05,773 --> 00:33:08,347
I really want to leave this place.

471
00:33:26,223 --> 00:33:27,497
What are you reading?

472
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:30,562
A case my colleague's working on.

473
00:33:30,562 --> 00:33:32,077
Where's the remote control?

474
00:33:33,732 --> 00:33:35,373
Can't people leave it...

475
00:33:35,373 --> 00:33:37,132
- where it was? - Dad.

476
00:33:37,132 --> 00:33:38,548
- Listen to this. - Here it is.

477
00:33:39,272 --> 00:33:42,887
People keep disappearing from this studio.

478
00:33:43,112 --> 00:33:45,312
My colleague thinks there's definitely...

479
00:33:45,312 --> 00:33:49,513
a correlation between the studio and the disappearances.

480
00:33:49,513 --> 00:33:51,227
- It's a case? - Yes.

481
00:33:52,783 --> 00:33:54,568
There's only strong suspicion.

482
00:33:54,792 --> 00:33:56,198
But there is no physical evidence.

483
00:33:56,652 --> 00:33:58,167
This is the problem.

484
00:33:59,323 --> 00:34:02,468
- I am really concerned. - Why?

485
00:34:02,833 --> 00:34:04,537
It's just a studio.

486
00:34:04,703 --> 00:34:06,732
So what about a studio?

487
00:34:06,732 --> 00:34:09,172
It's barely big enough for a person to lie down in.

488
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,508
If anything happens...

489
00:34:11,442 --> 00:34:13,878
It's too heartbreaking.

490
00:34:14,542 --> 00:34:16,588
You need to mind your own business.

491
00:34:16,712 --> 00:34:19,787
Why would you say that? You aren't helping me.

492
00:34:22,013 --> 00:34:24,497
I am sure he is not acting alone.

493
00:34:24,783 --> 00:34:25,858
Right?

494
00:34:26,623 --> 00:34:28,568
- Think about it. - Right.

495
00:34:29,922 --> 00:34:32,123
Studios...

496
00:34:32,123 --> 00:34:35,533
have a lot of surveillance cameras and people.

497
00:34:35,533 --> 00:34:36,562
Right?

498
00:34:36,562 --> 00:34:39,577
And if they are to move separately,

499
00:34:39,732 --> 00:34:42,948
it will be hard to hide their crimes.

500
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:48,347
They will have a leader who orchestrates everything.

501
00:34:48,913 --> 00:34:50,048
A leader?

502
00:34:50,772 --> 00:34:53,583
Seriously? You need to use your brain.

503
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:54,853
Come on, just help me.

504
00:34:54,853 --> 00:34:57,557
- I am watching TV. - Come on.

505
00:34:59,252 --> 00:35:00,497
What I am saying...

506
00:35:01,353 --> 00:35:05,267
is that in cases of murder committed by partners,

507
00:35:05,562 --> 00:35:08,037
it is usually lead by a very strong figure.

508
00:35:08,493 --> 00:35:10,062
And that dominant figure will allocate roles...

509
00:35:10,062 --> 00:35:12,608
so the subordinates will move in an organized manner.

510
00:35:13,533 --> 00:35:14,648
Organized?

511
00:35:15,132 --> 00:35:18,917
That's why they will rarely leave any traces behind.

512
00:35:19,603 --> 00:35:21,948
There must be a leader who orchestrates everything.

513
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:27,718
Is it her?

514
00:35:32,252 --> 00:35:34,428
It could be someone else.

515
00:35:35,723 --> 00:35:37,862
But from what you said,

516
00:35:37,862 --> 00:35:40,623
this woman is somehow involved in everything.

517
00:35:40,623 --> 00:35:43,037
I need to get into this right now.

518
00:35:43,562 --> 00:35:44,778
Thank you, Dad!

519
00:35:47,803 --> 00:35:50,247
Why do you want to do it?

520
00:35:50,473 --> 00:35:52,243
Dad, I totally forgot. We should get ready.

521
00:35:52,243 --> 00:35:54,517
I forgot that we got tickets for a movie.

522
00:35:55,473 --> 00:35:56,617
Goodness.

523
00:36:04,783 --> 00:36:05,997
Do you like it?

524
00:36:06,953 --> 00:36:08,028
Yes.

525
00:36:08,393 --> 00:36:10,252
This room is 350 dollars a month.

526
00:36:10,252 --> 00:36:12,362
A lot of students came by to look at it.

527
00:36:12,362 --> 00:36:13,937
If you like it, you should sign soon.

528
00:36:14,323 --> 00:36:16,667
Or you can just give me your deposit first.

529
00:36:28,042 --> 00:36:30,287
- Can I take a look inside? - Sure, take your time.

530
00:36:37,783 --> 00:36:39,358
How much is it?

531
00:36:39,623 --> 00:36:41,223
This room is 250 dollars.

532
00:36:41,223 --> 00:36:43,398
- 250 dollars? - You have until today to decide.

533
00:36:43,692 --> 00:36:44,838
Until today?

534
00:36:45,163 --> 00:36:47,338
A cheap room like this will be gone by tomorrow.

535
00:36:54,603 --> 00:36:56,448
Are you really going to sign the contract?

536
00:36:58,002 --> 00:37:00,048
I am still looking.

537
00:37:00,873 --> 00:37:03,287
I can tell you this because I am not the landlord.

538
00:37:04,482 --> 00:37:06,517
- I wouldn't live here. - Why not?

539
00:37:07,143 --> 00:37:08,787
This is crazy.

540
00:37:14,353 --> 00:37:17,068
An old man who lived here passed away recently.

541
00:37:17,353 --> 00:37:19,393
- What? - He lived here by himself.

542
00:37:19,393 --> 00:37:20,738
And just died alone.

543
00:37:22,993 --> 00:37:26,477
The landlord kept saying that it's not true.

544
00:37:26,763 --> 00:37:28,648
But a cleaning crew came by a few days ago...

545
00:37:29,172 --> 00:37:30,747
and took everything away.

546
00:37:31,342 --> 00:37:32,648
Seriously...

547
00:37:34,203 --> 00:37:36,913
Is it possible then...

548
00:37:36,913 --> 00:37:40,218
the price may lower a little?

549
00:37:40,913 --> 00:37:43,528
Do you want to live like that after I told you what happened?

550
00:37:43,913 --> 00:37:45,497
Well...

551
00:37:46,353 --> 00:37:49,667
If the price is lower, I can think about it.

552
00:37:51,623 --> 00:37:54,767
Look at my goosebumps. I can't live here.

553
00:37:55,592 --> 00:37:56,667
Right...

554
00:37:56,993 --> 00:37:59,537
No one can live like a normal person here.

555
00:38:01,473 --> 00:38:03,533
Thank you. I will think about it.

556
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:04,718
- Will you? - Yes.

557
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:31,537
Dad, what do you think?

558
00:38:32,462 --> 00:38:35,132
I am really tired. Just get whatever and let's go home.

559
00:38:35,132 --> 00:38:37,508
- How can I? Come, look. - Seriously.

560
00:38:38,542 --> 00:38:40,542
You said we are going to the movies.

561
00:38:40,542 --> 00:38:42,812
It all looks the same. Just pick anything.

562
00:38:42,812 --> 00:38:45,712
How can you say that? They are not the same.

563
00:38:45,712 --> 00:38:47,882
A legend of the District Investigation Team must help me.

564
00:38:47,882 --> 00:38:49,453
- It's really hard to choose. - Whatever.

565
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:52,398
- Such an old story. - He is so mean.

566
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:04,908
What's wrong?

567
00:39:05,603 --> 00:39:06,738
What is it?

568
00:39:07,062 --> 00:39:10,608
I think I just saw our dentist.

569
00:39:11,603 --> 00:39:13,747
- Is it a man? - Yes.

570
00:39:14,172 --> 00:39:16,247
- Is he handsome? - Yes.

571
00:39:18,612 --> 00:39:20,988
He is really good-looking, but it's nothing like that.

572
00:39:22,053 --> 00:39:24,882
If I take a look at his face,

573
00:39:24,882 --> 00:39:26,597
I will be able to tell.

574
00:39:26,853 --> 00:39:28,997
You just said it's an old story.

575
00:39:29,292 --> 00:39:30,428
Come on.

576
00:39:30,592 --> 00:39:33,497
I can tell what kind of person my daughter's boyfriend is.

577
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:35,908
Take this. It suits you.

578
00:39:36,632 --> 00:39:37,807
Go on. Hurry up.

579
00:39:38,632 --> 00:39:40,533
- Go. - I will just get both.

580
00:39:40,533 --> 00:39:41,703
Fine.

581
00:39:41,703 --> 00:39:42,878
- Really? - Yes.

582
00:39:52,482 --> 00:39:55,028
Should I ask Jae Ho to give me a pay advance?

583
00:39:56,583 --> 00:39:58,723
Even if I get the advance, with taxes and everything,

584
00:39:58,723 --> 00:40:00,158
it will leave me less than 1,000 dollars.

585
00:40:00,652 --> 00:40:03,022
I can't live in a place with a monthly rent of 400 dollars.

586
00:40:03,022 --> 00:40:04,398
Remember Soo Young, my friend?

587
00:40:04,993 --> 00:40:06,497
Soo Young? Sure.

588
00:40:06,792 --> 00:40:08,533
The man she is supposed to marry...

589
00:40:08,533 --> 00:40:09,968
doesn't own a house but lives in a rented house.

590
00:40:10,132 --> 00:40:11,433
I thought his family was rich.

591
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:13,263
He acted like he was really rich.

592
00:40:13,263 --> 00:40:14,437
I know, right?

593
00:40:15,272 --> 00:40:17,278
That's why Soo Young is now very confused.

594
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:20,103
How can a man of his age not even own a house?

595
00:40:20,103 --> 00:40:21,617
That is so pitiful.

596
00:40:22,143 --> 00:40:23,312
Isn't that funny?

597
00:40:23,312 --> 00:40:25,258
If you are such a loser, how can you even dare to date?

598
00:40:25,612 --> 00:40:26,718
Exactly.

599
00:40:30,083 --> 00:40:32,258
Let's talk inside.

600
00:40:32,553 --> 00:40:33,628
Sure.

601
00:40:36,053 --> 00:40:37,353
Did you see his face?

602
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:39,398
Yes. His stare made me feel disgusted.

603
00:41:05,283 --> 00:41:07,798
Let's go. I said I am hungry.

604
00:41:08,752 --> 00:41:10,823
- What are you eating? - This one.

605
00:41:10,823 --> 00:41:12,198
You can eat that.

606
00:41:14,462 --> 00:41:15,937
This is driving me crazy.

607
00:41:16,333 --> 00:41:18,338
Why do I keep seeing him?

608
00:41:21,002 --> 00:41:23,533
Gosh. Hi, Ji Eun.

609
00:41:23,533 --> 00:41:25,117
What's wrong?

610
00:41:25,502 --> 00:41:29,088
I thought I met that man from the studio.

611
00:41:29,973 --> 00:41:31,088
A man?

612
00:41:32,042 --> 00:41:34,588
Did you see that man last night?

613
00:41:35,312 --> 00:41:37,858
He has long hair and a very pale face.

614
00:41:38,252 --> 00:41:40,783
He wears a shirt that is about this long.

615
00:41:40,783 --> 00:41:42,667
- Did you... - Maybe he came to watch a movie.

616
00:41:42,922 --> 00:41:44,298
Or maybe someone that looks like him.

617
00:41:46,663 --> 00:41:47,767
Well,

618
00:41:48,433 --> 00:41:51,537
he came to my office the other day.

619
00:41:52,362 --> 00:41:54,948
- I think he is stalking me... - Jong Woo, please!

620
00:41:56,132 --> 00:41:57,307
That's enough.

621
00:41:58,373 --> 00:41:59,917
Why are you doing this?

622
00:42:01,442 --> 00:42:02,517
Seriously.

623
00:42:03,542 --> 00:42:05,687
You are not the only one who lives in a studio.

624
00:42:06,183 --> 00:42:08,488
There are many strange people in society.

625
00:42:08,913 --> 00:42:10,928
Why do you make such a big deal out of it?

626
00:42:12,953 --> 00:42:14,658
Do you think I am a loser too?

627
00:42:15,453 --> 00:42:16,528
What?

628
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:22,238
- This is too much. - What is too much?

629
00:42:23,493 --> 00:42:24,608
Ji Eun.

630
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:28,548
Can't you just listen to me?

631
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:32,117
I'm going to go. I am tired.

632
00:42:35,772 --> 00:42:36,847
Fine. Go.

633
00:42:38,042 --> 00:42:40,258
You only listen to things that you want to hear.

634
00:42:43,982 --> 00:42:45,227
Have a good weekend.

635
00:43:07,643 --> 00:43:10,287
Hyun Ho. Did you figure anything out?

636
00:43:10,473 --> 00:43:12,057
That woman gives off a bad vibe.

637
00:43:12,482 --> 00:43:14,488
Does she? Give me a minute.

638
00:43:16,152 --> 00:43:17,528
Right. Tell me.

639
00:43:18,283 --> 00:43:20,183
First, she married twice.

640
00:43:20,183 --> 00:43:22,997
Both husbands died in accidents and she has no children.

641
00:43:23,323 --> 00:43:24,867
And even her parents died in an accident.

642
00:43:25,692 --> 00:43:26,767
I see.

643
00:43:27,092 --> 00:43:28,833
What creeps me out the most is that...

644
00:43:28,833 --> 00:43:31,937
she was the benefactor of their life insurance policies.

645
00:43:32,663 --> 00:43:34,008
It's about one million dollars.

646
00:43:36,672 --> 00:43:38,448
One million dollars?

647
00:43:39,243 --> 00:43:40,243
Got it.

648
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:43,172
And it seems she opened an orphanage with the life insurance money...

649
00:43:43,172 --> 00:43:46,342
but she had fire insurance for it so that was compensated later too.

650
00:43:46,342 --> 00:43:48,528
I see.

651
00:43:48,812 --> 00:43:51,727
And that studio used to be her husband's business.

652
00:43:52,422 --> 00:43:53,497
Jung Hwa.

653
00:43:53,982 --> 00:43:56,028
Shouldn't we pass this over to the Criminal Division?

654
00:43:57,152 --> 00:43:58,568
Right?

655
00:43:59,092 --> 00:44:00,968
We should.

656
00:44:01,562 --> 00:44:04,008
But all we have now is just suspicion.

657
00:44:07,103 --> 00:44:10,048
Hyun Ho. Thank you, anyway. Okay.

658
00:44:10,373 --> 00:44:12,847
See you tomorrow. Okay. Bye.

659
00:44:23,812 --> 00:44:25,258
Welcome.

660
00:44:33,893 --> 00:44:35,167
Hello.

661
00:45:58,243 --> 00:45:59,858
This is strange.

662
00:46:00,143 --> 00:46:02,457
Why is it so quiet in here today?

663
00:46:34,183 --> 00:46:35,982
- Who is it? - Hello.

664
00:46:35,982 --> 00:46:39,198
I just moved in across the hall. I was wondering...

665
00:46:39,453 --> 00:46:41,398
if I could borrow your charger.

666
00:46:42,152 --> 00:46:43,767
He's new?

667
00:46:44,953 --> 00:46:46,167
Excuse me.

668
00:46:51,632 --> 00:46:52,862
Hello.

669
00:46:52,862 --> 00:46:54,137
What is this about?

670
00:46:54,163 --> 00:46:55,948
Well...

671
00:46:56,103 --> 00:47:00,477
I need to use my phone later, but I don't have a charger.

672
00:47:00,672 --> 00:47:02,448
Can I borrow your charger?

673
00:47:20,422 --> 00:47:21,537
Oh, right.

674
00:47:22,732 --> 00:47:23,962
Thank you.

675
00:47:23,962 --> 00:47:27,077
And the convenience store down the street sells chargers.

676
00:47:27,362 --> 00:47:28,608
Okay.

677
00:47:29,473 --> 00:47:30,648
Thank you.

678
00:47:33,002 --> 00:47:36,448
Thank you. I'll give it right back. Thank you.

679
00:48:09,343 --> 00:48:11,849
Hey, that's enough. Clean that up.

680
00:48:16,013 --> 00:48:19,559
But why are we the only ones cleaning up this mess afterward?

681
00:48:22,124 --> 00:48:23,699
Then do you want to do the cutting?

682
00:48:24,124 --> 00:48:27,398
Hey, you must think my job is easy.

683
00:48:27,493 --> 00:48:29,838
I always have to put on pain relief patches afterward.

684
00:48:44,243 --> 00:48:45,449
Be quiet.

685
00:48:47,343 --> 00:48:48,619
Be quiet.

686
00:48:53,754 --> 00:48:56,599
Why must we be quiet? Why?

687
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:02,068
Be quiet, you punk.

688
00:49:02,723 --> 00:49:05,409
Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed today?

689
00:49:05,633 --> 00:49:07,469
Are you scared Unit 303 might catch us?

690
00:49:08,234 --> 00:49:10,579
If he does, we can just finish him off.

691
00:49:10,763 --> 00:49:14,349
You moron. You look so scared right now.

692
00:49:15,343 --> 00:49:17,378
Who's scared? Me?

693
00:49:17,444 --> 00:49:21,044
I wasn't scared at all.

694
00:49:21,044 --> 00:49:22,289
Me?

695
00:49:27,053 --> 00:49:28,258
Should I show you?

696
00:49:30,924 --> 00:49:32,229
Show me.

697
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:45,208
She said no one lives on that floor.

698
00:49:46,133 --> 00:49:49,318
But why do I keep hearing noises since the first day I moved here?

699
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:14,108
Show me.

700
00:50:21,604 --> 00:50:24,778
Stop it, you punk.

701
00:50:25,544 --> 00:50:26,789
I'll really do it.

702
00:50:28,144 --> 00:50:29,389
Is anyone there?

703
00:50:32,314 --> 00:50:33,789
Is anyone there?

704
00:50:41,154 --> 00:50:42,499
Is anyone there?

705
00:50:42,924 --> 00:50:44,162
It all worked out.

706
00:50:44,163 --> 00:50:47,738
He came here on his own to be killed. We can kill him here.

707
00:50:54,973 --> 00:50:57,619
That jerk. He's been behaving lately.

708
00:50:57,644 --> 00:50:59,519
He's a total nut job.

709
00:51:16,794 --> 00:51:18,039
Is anyone there?

710
00:51:32,044 --> 00:51:33,548
Mom, hold on.

711
00:52:00,874 --> 00:52:02,208
(Eden Studio)

712
00:52:03,144 --> 00:52:04,318
Yes, Mom.

713
00:52:32,004 --> 00:52:33,349
That jerk.

714
00:52:36,544 --> 00:52:37,619
Yes, Mom.

715
00:52:37,843 --> 00:52:40,048
Where are you?

716
00:52:40,243 --> 00:52:41,688
Me?

717
00:52:42,644 --> 00:52:44,219
Where do you think?

718
00:52:46,113 --> 00:52:47,559
I'm at home. What is it?

719
00:53:00,794 --> 00:53:03,809
Being quiet is a must when living at a studio apartment.

720
00:53:04,363 --> 00:53:06,878
He should've known better if he's lived here that long.

721
00:53:12,544 --> 00:53:15,488
I love what I do.

722
00:53:15,883 --> 00:53:18,019
So if anyone tries...

723
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:20,559
to interfere with my work,

724
00:53:21,683 --> 00:53:23,499
I won't stand still, okay?

725
00:53:24,124 --> 00:53:25,258
Do you understand?

726
00:53:36,663 --> 00:53:37,738
What's wrong?

727
00:53:38,133 --> 00:53:40,648
Do you want to leave as well?

728
00:53:45,044 --> 00:53:46,289
That is...

729
00:53:48,013 --> 00:53:49,559
ridiculous.

730
00:53:49,814 --> 00:53:53,688
I love what I do.

731
00:54:01,394 --> 00:54:04,039
Did Deuk Su go to paradise first?

732
00:54:05,524 --> 00:54:06,708
All right.

733
00:54:08,464 --> 00:54:10,878
- The sooner, the better. - Will you be able...

734
00:54:11,933 --> 00:54:13,949
to listen to me?

735
00:54:17,073 --> 00:54:18,878
Of course.

736
00:54:20,274 --> 00:54:21,449
I...

737
00:54:22,714 --> 00:54:25,258
love this job...

738
00:54:27,484 --> 00:54:29,258
so much.

739
00:54:36,323 --> 00:54:38,639
But what's wrong with your voice?

740
00:54:40,433 --> 00:54:42,863
I had a dream about you,

741
00:54:42,863 --> 00:54:44,539
and it felt ominous.

742
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:47,309
Is everything all right?

743
00:54:47,834 --> 00:54:49,318
Yes, everything's fine.

744
00:54:49,604 --> 00:54:50,719
Jong Woo.

745
00:54:51,444 --> 00:54:52,818
Be careful of others.

746
00:54:53,343 --> 00:54:56,059
Humans are the most fearful beings.

747
00:54:56,513 --> 00:54:57,619
All right.

748
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:00,829
Don't worry about me and go back to bed.

749
00:55:01,013 --> 00:55:03,298
You need to wake up early and go to the marketplace.

750
00:55:04,524 --> 00:55:06,798
- Jong Woo. - Yes?

751
00:55:07,154 --> 00:55:09,469
- Isn't it tough? - I mean...

752
00:55:10,394 --> 00:55:15,168
Please stop worrying about me. I'm not a boy.

753
00:55:15,433 --> 00:55:18,039
To parents, their kids will always be kids.

754
00:55:18,734 --> 00:55:20,073
All right. Go to bed.

755
00:55:20,073 --> 00:55:23,719
Okay. Don't keep the windows open no matter how hot it is.

756
00:55:23,944 --> 00:55:26,488
All right, I'm hanging up. Goodnight.

757
00:55:32,144 --> 00:55:34,258
I wonder who went in there.

758
00:55:47,593 --> 00:55:49,608
Never mind. Just forget about it.

759
00:57:36,073 --> 00:57:37,219
Who are you?

760
00:57:40,774 --> 00:57:41,988
Who are you?

761
00:57:52,453 --> 00:57:53,599
Run.

762
00:57:56,663 --> 00:57:57,838
I said, run.

763
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:50,808
(Stranger from Hell)

764
00:58:51,094 --> 00:58:52,534
If someone tries to...

765
00:58:52,534 --> 00:58:54,563
break in or open the door...

766
00:58:54,563 --> 00:58:57,779
while I'm away, could you take some photos?

767
00:58:58,003 --> 00:59:00,373
- Unit 303. - Please spare me.

768
00:59:00,373 --> 00:59:03,788
You know this is all your fault, right?

769
00:59:04,813 --> 00:59:07,019
Come here. Let's eat.

770
00:59:07,244 --> 00:59:09,258
Do you know of a place called Spring Orphanage?

771
00:59:09,284 --> 00:59:11,229
It's similar to our hospital's name.

772
00:59:12,454 --> 00:59:13,959
What's with this punk?

773
00:59:14,523 --> 00:59:15,554
Excuse me.

774
00:59:15,554 --> 00:59:17,824
We don't know where to go thanks to you.

775
00:59:17,824 --> 00:59:19,129
Don't smile like that.
