3
00:00:39,491 --> 00:00:41,237
Do you want me to kill you now?

4
00:00:42,561 --> 00:00:45,436
All right, how should I kill you?

5
00:00:46,822 --> 00:00:47,997
Honey.

6
00:00:48,752 --> 00:00:49,927
Tell me.

7
00:00:54,462 --> 00:00:55,537
Where are you going?

8
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:59,007
Come here. Come over here. Hey.

9
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:03,077
Come here. I said, come here.

10
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:05,901
What did you touch in my room?

11
00:01:05,972 --> 00:01:08,802
Why did you sneak into my room? Tell me, you punk.

12
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:11,011
- Give me the gun. - I was...

13
00:01:11,011 --> 00:01:12,811
- Give me the gun. - It wasn't me.

14
00:01:12,811 --> 00:01:14,811
Give it to me. Stand straight.

15
00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:16,326
What did you take from my room?

16
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,451
Why did you sneak into my room?

17
00:01:17,451 --> 00:01:19,921
I didn't. It really wasn't me.

18
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:21,052
What did you take, you punk?

19
00:01:21,052 --> 00:01:23,826
What did you take?

20
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:26,567
I'm telling you. It wasn't me!

21
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:28,696
I know it was you.

22
00:01:28,891 --> 00:01:31,332
What will you do if it wasn't me?

23
00:01:31,332 --> 00:01:33,276
You want to bet your wrist?

24
00:01:56,251 --> 00:02:00,366
Is something fun going on here?

25
00:02:03,162 --> 00:02:05,492
Are you punks making a fool out of me?

26
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,706
What? They're twins?

27
00:02:08,732 --> 00:02:12,476
You should give me your wrist, right?

28
00:02:13,272 --> 00:02:15,371
How about this? I'll break your leg.

29
00:02:15,371 --> 00:02:17,042
Get out of the way.

30
00:02:17,042 --> 00:02:19,146
- Calm down. - Get out of the way!

31
00:02:20,042 --> 00:02:21,157
What is happening?

32
00:02:25,982 --> 00:02:27,296

00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:34,161
He keeps sneaking into my room!

36
00:02:34,161 --> 00:02:35,837
Did you actually see him go in?

37
00:02:36,332 --> 00:02:38,531
Did you really go into his room?

38
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:40,262
Are you all teasing me?

39
00:02:40,262 --> 00:02:42,732
Why would I go in there...

40
00:02:42,732 --> 00:02:44,371
when I have my own room?

41
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:45,807
You punk!

42
00:03:13,432 --> 00:03:16,307
Why don't you calm down? We have a newcomer.

43
00:03:21,341 --> 00:03:22,747
Apologize.

44
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:26,217
They misunderstand you since you're always giggling.

45
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:28,441
You shouldn't inconvenience others.

46
00:03:28,512 --> 00:03:32,856
Okay. I'm sorry, sir.

47
00:03:35,721 --> 00:03:37,766
You'll accept his apology, right?

48
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:45,467
I know that you're all in this together.

49
00:03:45,591 --> 00:03:47,277
What do you mean?

50
00:03:50,371 --> 00:03:51,877
Go back inside.

51
00:03:52,071 --> 00:03:53,071
You shouldn't act this way...

52
00:03:53,071 --> 00:03:54,377
just because you've lived here for a long time.

53
00:04:05,251 --> 00:04:08,052
We're not usually like this. You must've been startled.

54
00:04:08,052 --> 00:04:09,696
I'm fine.

55
00:04:10,052 --> 00:04:11,326
Are you sure?

56
00:04:11,922 --> 00:04:13,567
Yes. Anyway...

57
00:04:14,362 --> 00:04:16,222
I should sleep since I need to go to work tomorrow.

58
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,191
- I see, you work at a company. - I do.

59
00:04:18,232 --> 00:04:20,177
You looked young, so I thought you were a student.

60
00:04:21,162 --> 00:04:22,576
Goodbye.

61
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,636
Darn it.

62
00:05:23,732 --> 00:05:25,492
Should I follow him?

(Episode 2: Human Nature)

64

Young man! Why are you startled?

65
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:56,766
A young man like you shouldn't be so faint-hearted.

66
00:05:57,032 --> 00:05:59,331
- Do you not have energy? - Do you need to say anything?

67
00:05:59,331 --> 00:06:01,362
I heard they caused a ruckus yesterday night.

68
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:03,206
I'm sorry about that.

69
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:05,902

Many people living under the same roof...

71
00:06:07,441 --> 00:06:08,972
could cause such a scene. I'm fine. I should go.

72
00:06:08,972 --> 00:06:11,042
Thank you for thinking that way.

73
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:12,842
A moment ago,

74
00:06:12,842 --> 00:06:15,941
the thug told me that he's moving out.

75
00:06:15,941 --> 00:06:17,282
So don't worry.

76
00:06:17,282 --> 00:06:18,886
I see.

77
00:06:18,912 --> 00:06:21,982
He was one frightening man.

78
00:06:21,982 --> 00:06:24,021
When I was sitting in my office,

79
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:27,096
he'd watch me with a strange gaze.

80
00:06:27,121 --> 00:06:29,321
- It was frightening. - I'm sorry,

81
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:30,732
but I need to go to work.

82
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:32,737

Yes, that one.

- Well... - Are you going to work?

88
00:07:03,732 --> 00:07:04,906
Yes.

120
00:08:33,652 --> 00:08:36,357
Forget it and bring some hot water for some cup noodles.

121
00:08:38,022 --> 00:08:41,292
Sir, you can do it yourself. That's called power-tripping.

122
00:08:41,292 --> 00:08:42,766
- He's done it before too. - Bye.

00:08:43,432 --> 00:08:45,036

Nobody told me.

00:09:31,241 --> 00:09:32,416

Mr. Park Byung Min,

151
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:54,666
- did you say hi? - Yes, I did earlier.

00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,536
Take good care of him, Byung Min.

153

He's a smart kid,

154

Who? Big head?

163

- Big head? - His head is huge.

164

- You're right. - He gets his job done.

165
00:11:30,932 --> 00:11:32,892
He'll be nice if you just kiss up to him,

166
00:11:32,892 --> 00:11:34,377
so try to be nice.

167
00:11:34,502 --> 00:11:37,607
You have the little brother look.

168
00:11:38,331 --> 00:11:39,507
- Fine. - Hey,

00:11:40,002 --> 00:11:42,802
the real grown-up life begins not in college nor in the army.

170
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,046
It begins right here, at work.

Even if you don't like how things are here,

172
00:11:46,542 --> 00:11:48,142
- you just have to stick through. - Fine.

173
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:49,556
You know how difficult it is to earn money.

174
00:11:49,912 --> 00:11:51,156
I understand.

175
00:11:51,552 --> 00:11:53,526
Right, I should call you "Mr. Shin".

176
00:11:54,022 --> 00:11:56,321
Just call me by my name when it's just the two of us.

177
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:57,896
- Okay. - Good. I'll go to the bathroom.

178
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,697
- What's that? - What?

179
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:02,997
It looks like someone spat.

180

What is this?

184
00:12:19,341 --> 00:12:21,757
There are some really strange people out there.

185
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:25,827
You know the people that went to the emergency room last night?

186
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:27,597
Apparently, they were strangers,

187
00:12:28,052 --> 00:12:32,396
but they began fighting for no reasons.

188
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:33,762
Isn't that ridiculous?

189
00:12:33,762 --> 00:12:35,666
He could've died on the spot were it not for you.

190
00:12:36,361 --> 00:12:38,436
The guy who spat on you.

191
00:12:39,731 --> 00:12:43,207
He has anger management issues. Just ignore such people.

192
00:12:43,532 --> 00:12:46,201
You have to be careful too. You can't manage your anger at times.

193
00:12:46,201 --> 00:12:47,947
Don't frown at me.

194
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,016
What are you looking at?

195
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:57,727
What a creep.

196
00:13:19,601 --> 00:13:20,747
What's happening?

197
00:13:22,642 --> 00:13:23,786
Where's my knife?

198
00:13:47,632 --> 00:13:49,276
Let go of me!

199
00:13:49,502 --> 00:13:50,947
It's your turn now.

200
00:14:09,652 --> 00:14:10,766
Darn it.

201
00:14:23,461 --> 00:14:25,676
(Eden Studio, 4th Floor, Women's Floor)

202
00:15:45,552 --> 00:15:46,827
Goodness.

203
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:54,467
(Police)

204
00:16:03,432 --> 00:16:04,471
Hello?

205
00:16:04,471 --> 00:16:07,471
Are you the owner of the car with the plate number 9688?

206
00:16:07,471 --> 00:16:08,471
Yes.

207
00:16:08,471 --> 00:16:11,487
I'm Soh Jung Hwa from the police.

208
00:16:11,912 --> 00:16:13,816
May I check the dash cam in your car?

209
00:16:29,721 --> 00:16:30,936
It's the guy from Yusang Technical High School.

210
00:16:31,432 --> 00:16:32,461
Sorry?

211
00:16:32,461 --> 00:16:34,607
It's the stationary store by the intersection, don't you know?

212
00:16:34,831 --> 00:16:36,676
The intersection?

213
00:16:36,902 --> 00:16:38,046
Well...

214
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,272
- You see that intersection there? - Yes.

215
00:16:40,272 --> 00:16:41,402
- See the hair salon? - Yes.

216
00:16:41,402 --> 00:16:43,002
Turn right from there.

217
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,172
Turn right.

218
00:16:44,172 --> 00:16:45,487
Go straight from there.

219
00:16:46,111 --> 00:16:49,841
There are lots of teenage boys during that time.

220
00:16:49,841 --> 00:16:50,926
I see.

221
00:16:52,282 --> 00:16:55,857
- Do you mind if I speed it up? - No problem.

222
00:16:58,821 --> 00:17:00,296
Hold on.

223
00:17:02,561 --> 00:17:05,407
Does that man come here often?

224
00:17:05,632 --> 00:17:07,536
That man?

225
00:17:08,031 --> 00:17:10,477
He lives in the neighborhood that will be redeveloped.

226
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,306
Redeveloped?

227
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:21,657
Barely anyone lives there.

228
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,717
What was the name of the studio?

229
00:17:24,112 --> 00:17:25,727
Mideum? Eden?

230
00:17:26,011 --> 00:17:27,657
It's something like that.

231
00:17:27,981 --> 00:17:29,427
I didn't know such a place existed around here.

232
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:32,727
It's a creepy place, so many people don't know about it.

233
00:17:32,822 --> 00:17:33,997
It's up the hill.

234
00:17:37,892 --> 00:17:39,606
"Eden Studio"?

235
00:17:39,961 --> 00:17:43,007
(Eden Studio)

236
00:17:44,932 --> 00:17:47,076
(Police)

237
00:18:13,362 --> 00:18:14,707
Hello.

238
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:18,731
What brings a police officer here?

239
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,076
Hello.

240
00:18:20,501 --> 00:18:23,342
- You must be hot, you're sweating. - I'm fine.

241
00:18:23,342 --> 00:18:25,346
- You can use this. - I'm really fine.

242
00:18:25,612 --> 00:18:27,917
- You're the owner, right? - Yes, that's me.

243
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:30,382
I just have a question.

244
00:18:30,382 --> 00:18:32,157
This man,

245
00:18:32,682 --> 00:18:34,697
he lives here, right?

246
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:37,126
He lives in Unit 306.

247
00:18:37,622 --> 00:18:38,892
He's a resident here?

248
00:18:38,892 --> 00:18:41,397
Yes, he lives here.

249
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:42,997
Why?

250
00:18:43,662 --> 00:18:46,392
I just had a couple of questions for him.

251
00:18:46,392 --> 00:18:47,876
What?

252
00:18:48,662 --> 00:18:52,677
I told him not to, but I guess he did it again.

253
00:18:53,402 --> 00:18:55,816
He's a good man, but he's mentally retarded.

254
00:18:57,741 --> 00:19:00,342
Unit 306, come here.

255
00:19:00,342 --> 00:19:01,856
A police officer is here.

256
00:19:21,102 --> 00:19:22,677
I told you...

257
00:19:22,832 --> 00:19:26,007
that you'll be in trouble if you abuse animals.

258
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:31,616
I didn't do anything.

259
00:19:40,281 --> 00:19:42,326
I just got it while I was getting mine. It was cheap.

260
00:19:42,652 --> 00:19:44,826
It was a buy one get one free deal.

261
00:19:45,152 --> 00:19:47,397
Take it, I have one anyway.

262
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,697
They're pretty.

263
00:19:51,892 --> 00:19:54,606
I think these would look better on Jong Woo.

264
00:19:54,731 --> 00:19:57,106
Mr. Park, Jong Woo can wear these, right?

265
00:19:58,201 --> 00:20:00,207
Jong Woo, you didn't bring your slippers, did you?

266
00:20:00,602 --> 00:20:03,116
- No, I didn't. - Wear these.

267
00:20:05,011 --> 00:20:06,241
Try them on, it's fine.

268
00:20:06,241 --> 00:20:07,556
- Right now? - Yes, it's fine.

269
00:20:15,551 --> 00:20:18,596
You're rocking them. Absolutely adorable.

270
00:20:19,291 --> 00:20:20,526
Yu Jung,

271
00:20:21,092 --> 00:20:23,291
he's taken. Don't even try.

272
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,066
I didn't do anything.

273
00:20:25,491 --> 00:20:27,477
Jong Woo must be happy because he's already popular here.

274
00:20:28,332 --> 00:20:30,376
I'm unpopular, so I'm heading out to a meeting now.

275
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,147
- See you. - See you.

276
00:20:37,372 --> 00:20:38,487
Sir.

277
00:20:38,642 --> 00:20:40,842
If you keep killing cats,

278
00:20:40,842 --> 00:20:43,741
according to the animal protection law, you will face...

279
00:20:43,741 --> 00:20:46,286
two years in prison or pay a fine of 20,000 dollars.

280
00:20:47,551 --> 00:20:49,697
You understand what I'm saying, right?

281
00:20:50,352 --> 00:20:53,526
Please. Don't kid around now.

282
00:20:54,062 --> 00:20:55,237
Bang.

283
00:20:56,761 --> 00:20:59,691
Hey, you shouldn't be playing with a toy gun at a police station.

284
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,731
Sir, don't kid around now.

285
00:21:01,731 --> 00:21:04,001
You killed 13 cats. 13 cats.

286
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:07,747
You have brutally butchered 13 cats.

287
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:11,586
Don't you feel pity for them? No?

288
00:21:15,112 --> 00:21:18,182
It's not 13 cats.

289
00:21:18,182 --> 00:21:19,286
Pardon?

290
00:21:19,652 --> 00:21:20,856
Ms. Soh.

291
00:21:21,051 --> 00:21:23,157
I only killed one.

292
00:21:27,021 --> 00:21:29,066
Don't do anything. Stay here.

293
00:21:33,362 --> 00:21:35,132
Mr. Park told me.

294
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:36,832
There's no proof that he killed all of them.

295
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:38,471
Sir, come here.

296
00:21:38,471 --> 00:21:39,832
- Look at this. - This way.

297
00:21:39,832 --> 00:21:42,441
Given the report of the previous incidents,

298
00:21:42,441 --> 00:21:45,812
most of the cats were burnt...

299
00:21:45,842 --> 00:21:47,417
or scorched.

300
00:21:47,642 --> 00:21:48,711
Isn't this incident different?

301
00:21:48,711 --> 00:21:51,711
Exactly. That's why we ought to investigate this.

302
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:53,727
Hey, how can we do that?

303
00:21:54,011 --> 00:21:55,951
Look at that guy. Do you think you can actually talk to him?

304
00:21:55,951 --> 00:21:57,922
- Have one. - Just give him a warning for now.

305
00:21:57,922 --> 00:21:59,751
- And send him home. - Sir.

306
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:01,796
Is this the only case you'll work on?

307
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:04,832
Sir, don't shoot. Give it to me.

308
00:22:04,832 --> 00:22:06,507
- Hey! - The gun.

309
00:22:06,932 --> 00:22:09,036
If you do that again, you'll...

310
00:22:09,301 --> 00:22:10,477
end up in prison.

311
00:22:10,932 --> 00:22:12,007
Got that?

312
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:16,001
I'm sorry,

313
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,586
sir.

314
00:22:18,711 --> 00:22:20,142
Don't do that again, okay?

315
00:22:20,142 --> 00:22:21,217
Besides,

316
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:24,957
you shouldn't be shooting at people. Understood?

317
00:22:26,751 --> 00:22:29,257
- Okay. - Send him home.

318
00:22:29,751 --> 00:22:30,826
Okay.

319
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:33,592
You can leave now. Get up.

320
00:22:33,592 --> 00:22:35,397
Okay. Leave now.

321
00:22:38,031 --> 00:22:40,507
Right. Goodbye.

322
00:22:42,062 --> 00:22:43,501
Bye.

323
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,332
Sir, but still. You can't just send him back...

324
00:22:45,332 --> 00:22:46,507
- Hey. - without investigating this...

325
00:22:47,372 --> 00:22:48,776
The cats...

326
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,086
I feel bad for the cats.

327
00:22:51,441 --> 00:22:54,616
By the way, how many complaints did we get for the dead cats?

328
00:22:55,281 --> 00:22:57,551
Actually, we got a lot of complaints, didn't we?

329
00:22:57,551 --> 00:23:00,056
I don't care. I drank last night. I'm so hungover.

330
00:23:00,451 --> 00:23:01,697
Goodness.

331
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:06,652
- I'm hungry. - Okay. Take them.

332
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:08,967
Hello, kitty.

333
00:23:14,531 --> 00:23:15,707
Goodness.

334
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:19,207
- Here. - Thank you.

335
00:23:19,832 --> 00:23:21,316
- Hey. - Yes?

336
00:23:21,372 --> 00:23:22,647
Put this up.

337
00:23:25,312 --> 00:23:28,041
We registered some fingerprints to help us identify missing people.

338
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:29,941
We'd be able to find him quickly if his prints are registered.

339
00:23:29,941 --> 00:23:34,126
Hey, we only register kids or senile elderlies' in the system.

340
00:23:34,751 --> 00:23:37,427
- Let me see. - Here.

341
00:23:41,491 --> 00:23:43,596
(Missing Persons)

342
00:23:46,531 --> 00:23:49,707
Wait. "Mount Bong in District One of Eunhye-dong?"

343
00:23:51,231 --> 00:23:52,346
Hey.

344
00:23:53,001 --> 00:23:55,116
Isn't this near Eden Studio?

345
00:23:55,241 --> 00:23:58,116
(Eden Studio)

346
00:24:19,432 --> 00:24:21,036
I should just ax your neck.

347
00:24:22,261 --> 00:24:24,606
But the deal between us was your wrist.

348
00:24:28,372 --> 00:24:29,477
Are you scared?

349
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:35,257
Are you scared? Aren't you scared? Are you scared?

350
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:47,967
If it weren't for that guy, I would've sliced you right away.

351
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:01,647
I heard that you got hauled to the police station.

352
00:25:03,072 --> 00:25:07,487
They asked me questions.

353
00:25:08,112 --> 00:25:10,856
I told them I didn't know anything,

354
00:25:11,312 --> 00:25:13,657
so they sent me back home.

355
00:25:13,852 --> 00:25:17,652
It's not like they knew anything.

356
00:25:17,652 --> 00:25:20,227
I told you to be careful, not to raise any red flags.

357
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:25,507
No one noticed.

358
00:25:26,731 --> 00:25:30,637
Not the police. Don't let that guy catch you, you fool.

359
00:25:31,432 --> 00:25:34,747
Okay.

360
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,376
I got it.

361
00:25:41,371 --> 00:25:44,145
It's been over an hour, but they didn't give me any work.

362
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,885
Sir, what should I do?

363
00:25:50,611 --> 00:25:51,916
Sir?

364
00:25:54,381 --> 00:25:56,186
Hello, this is Son Yu Jung.

365
00:25:56,881 --> 00:25:59,050
Did you have lunch? The last time we spoke...

366
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:02,166
Sir, is there anything I can do to help?

367
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:04,166
I don't need any help.

368
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,696
No?

369
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,161
If you're that bored, go make me coffee.

370
00:26:09,161 --> 00:26:10,436
Coffee? Yes.

371
00:26:24,171 --> 00:26:26,916
That's what you want, right? Yes.

372
00:26:27,681 --> 00:26:29,855
What about the date?

373
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,496
I'll check it and call you again.

374
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:35,865
Okay.

375
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,496
Sir, here's your coffee.

376
00:26:40,591 --> 00:26:43,236
You didn't spit in it, right?

377
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:45,036
What? I didn't.

378
00:26:49,371 --> 00:26:50,446
Here.

379
00:26:50,671 --> 00:26:54,746
This is for the next month's show. Write up a press release for it.

380
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:59,016
As for the template, you can... What is that called?

381
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,055
There are many references. Look into those online.

382
00:27:02,681 --> 00:27:03,825
Okay.

383
00:27:05,421 --> 00:27:09,595
Mr. Shin said that you were smart. I'll check how good you are.

384
00:27:10,121 --> 00:27:11,266
Okay.

385
00:27:17,961 --> 00:27:20,206
(Women's slippers)

386
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:24,575
"Women's slippers".

387
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:28,516
Gosh. He likes her?

388
00:27:34,881 --> 00:27:36,611
- Jong Woo. - Yes?

389
00:27:36,681 --> 00:27:40,080
I'm going to forward the office number to yours now.

390
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,121
- People call after work hours too. - I see. Okay.

391
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:44,250
- I see. - Don't be flustered.

392
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,461
- Answer them and take care of them. - Okay.

393
00:27:46,461 --> 00:27:48,730
If you have any questions, ask Mr. Park.

394
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:50,865
- Okay. - Jong Woo.

395
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:53,176
- Yes? - Will you keep that up?

396
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,476
Pardon?

397
00:27:55,201 --> 00:27:56,701
You don't have to get up...

398
00:27:56,701 --> 00:27:58,246
from your seat like an elementary school kid.

399
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,315
- Okay. - Sit down.

400
00:28:02,970 --> 00:28:05,155
We have an elementary school kid in the office now.

401
00:28:06,941 --> 00:28:08,555
All right. Look over here.

402
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,986
Hold the toothbrush like this.

403
00:28:11,181 --> 00:28:14,050
From bottom to top. And from top to bottom.

404
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,795
And brush from the inside to the outside.

405
00:28:17,451 --> 00:28:20,861
You can brush from your gums just like this. Did you get it?

406
00:28:20,861 --> 00:28:22,006
Okay.

407
00:28:23,191 --> 00:28:25,330
If you don't brush your teeth, it will hurt again.

408
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:27,536
So you must keep the promise you made to me.

409
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,676
Okay.

410
00:28:29,871 --> 00:28:33,045
Just make sure he brushes his teeth. Don't worry.

411
00:28:33,141 --> 00:28:35,216
Thank you so much.

412
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,655
When he goes to other dentists, he cries and throws a fit.

413
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,756
But when he comes to you, he behaves so well.

414
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:46,355
My son likes you so much. He said you were cool.

415
00:28:47,681 --> 00:28:48,795
(Yu Spring Dentist)

416
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,635
I see.

417
00:28:54,461 --> 00:28:55,565
Okay.

418
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,305
I want to see him.

419
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,201
I'll come straight back after work.

420
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:07,371
Hey, let's go home after we finish up today...

421
00:29:07,371 --> 00:29:09,040
or not.

422
00:29:09,111 --> 00:29:11,216
We should grab dinner. It's Jong Woo's first day.

423
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:13,341
I have a family event today...

424
00:29:13,341 --> 00:29:15,256
or not.

425
00:29:15,351 --> 00:29:17,250
- I'm in. - Gosh.

426
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,780
I have some work to do today.

427
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,121
Jong Woo.

428
00:29:20,151 --> 00:29:23,290
If you're a new recruit, just say yes and follow us.

429
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:25,520
- That's right. - Yes.

430
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,391
He said yes right away.

431
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:28,666
He's cute.

432
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,206
Yu Jung,

433
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,730
I told you he was taken. Don't hit on him.

434
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,730
Why not? No one knows what might happen. Aren't I right?

435
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:35,730
Exactly.

436
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,575
She sure feels confident about herself. Let's get going.

437
00:29:38,901 --> 00:29:41,411
Lucky you. You're so popular.

438
00:29:41,411 --> 00:29:42,585
It's not like that.

439
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,885
He's blushing. How cute.

440
00:29:47,341 --> 00:29:48,786
He's such a show-off.

441
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,466
Ji Eun.

442
00:29:56,921 --> 00:29:59,560
Send me the cue sheet for tomorrow's variety show...

443
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,266
before clocking out.

444
00:30:01,631 --> 00:30:04,105
- Thanks. - Ma'am.

445
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
Yes?

446
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,145
Bo Mi is in charge of that program.

447
00:30:09,401 --> 00:30:11,300
Of course, I knew that.

448
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,970
Bo Mi took a sick leave today. Please send it to me.

449
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,085
But still...

450
00:30:16,711 --> 00:30:18,986
We're all assigned different tasks for a reason.

451
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:23,256
Ji Eun.

452
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,621
Don't you know that I asked you to do this...

453
00:30:25,621 --> 00:30:27,795
because you seemed the most reliable?

454
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,961
But at times, when I look at you... How do I put it?

455
00:30:31,961 --> 00:30:35,536
You seem like a stranger.

456
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,276
I'm sorry.

457
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,861
Also, don't frown about things like that.

458
00:30:40,861 --> 00:30:42,246
We don't need to be upset over that.

459
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:44,701
Don't frown. Smile, okay?

460
00:30:44,701 --> 00:30:46,601
We're all struggling together, right?

461
00:30:46,601 --> 00:30:48,516
Send it to my email. Bye.

Jong Woo, I heard you used to write.

471
00:32:05,121 --> 00:32:08,080
He's very good at it.

472
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,391
The other students called him a genius.

473
00:32:10,391 --> 00:32:12,466
- Really? - Yes.

474
00:32:12,861 --> 00:32:15,961
All the professors said that he'd lead...

475
00:32:15,961 --> 00:32:18,060
Korean literature.

476
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,861
How could a single writer...

477
00:32:19,861 --> 00:32:22,070
- lead Korean literature? - Why would you deny it?

478
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,131
- It's this world's fault... - Come on.

479
00:32:24,131 --> 00:32:26,240
for not recognizing a genius like you.

480
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,941
Remember that contest you applied for?

481
00:32:29,941 --> 00:32:31,881
- Why would you bring that up? - Weren't you disqualified?

482
00:32:31,881 --> 00:32:34,211
- Come on, stop it. - Were they the same one?

483
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:35,810
- Anyway! - I can't believe it.

484
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:39,121
Such a genius is a mere intern.

485
00:32:39,121 --> 00:32:41,621
How sad is this?

486
00:32:41,621 --> 00:32:43,550
He had to suffer so much to write.

487
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:45,560
For three years, he slept in the club room.

488
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:47,490
Didn't you take a semester off because you were poor?

489
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,490
Anyway, he pretty much lived...

490
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:51,730
in the club room for three consecutive years.

491
00:32:51,730 --> 00:32:53,401
He endured so much.

492
00:32:53,401 --> 00:32:56,570
But look at where he is now. It pains my heart.

493
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,040
Jong Woo, stop writing.

494
00:32:59,040 --> 00:33:01,070
Money is the best. Give up!

495
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,510
The art industry is rotting.

496
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,441
Art is ridiculous.

497
00:33:04,441 --> 00:33:07,040
The only thing it does is leech off of those around you.

498
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,385
I've drunk with many artists.

499
00:33:17,051 --> 00:33:18,865
Who are you to tell me to give up?

500
00:33:20,761 --> 00:33:23,005
Just give up, already.

501
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,901
The art industry is rotting.

502
00:33:24,901 --> 00:33:27,901
Don't involve yourself with those scumbags.

503
00:33:27,901 --> 00:33:31,330
- Hey, writing such things... - What?

504
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:34,376
won't change the world.

Sir, let's go home. We need to work again tomorrow.

507
00:33:38,881 --> 00:33:40,241
- Let's end it here. - Don't show up for work tomorrow.

508
00:33:40,241 --> 00:33:41,441
- Gosh. - Come on.

509
00:33:41,441 --> 00:33:43,250
You're usually good with alcohol, so why are you so drunk?

510
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,480
I'm not drunk.

511
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,925
- We'll be going home first. - He must be happy to have you.

512
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,825
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

513
00:33:51,961 --> 00:33:54,135
Shall we have another drink?

514
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,790
Sure.

515
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:58,836
I should head back home. I couldn't get much sleep.

516
00:33:59,230 --> 00:34:00,436
- Really? - Yes.

517
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,905
How disappointing.

518
00:34:03,471 --> 00:34:05,215
Then I should go home too.

519
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,376
- Jong Woo, where do you live? - There's a night market over there.

520
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,916
I live in Eunhyun-gu.

521
00:34:10,611 --> 00:34:11,985
That's so far away.

522
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:14,985
It would've been nice to have company in the cab.

523
00:34:15,381 --> 00:34:16,856
- Bye. See you tomorrow. - Goodbye.

524
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,465
Sir, I should go home.

525
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:28,905
Hey, intern.

526
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,135
Yes?

527
00:34:31,830 --> 00:34:34,235
Let me give you advice.

528
00:34:35,071 --> 00:34:38,305
Don't act all gallantly just because you're close to the CEO.

529
00:34:38,841 --> 00:34:40,916
- What do you mean? - Know your place, you scumbag!

530
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:49,555
Stay calm, stay calm.

531
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:52,626
Darn it.

533
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:23,471
- Hello? - Sir, it's me, Ahn Hee Joong.

534
00:36:23,471 --> 00:36:24,640
Hey, where are you?

535
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,680
Some lunatics...

536
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,016
- are trying to kill me. - Hey!

537
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,626
Darn it!

538
00:37:59,971 --> 00:38:01,646
I told you to keep an eye on him.

539
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,286
I'm sorry.

540
00:38:08,381 --> 00:38:09,856
I was hungry.

541
00:38:43,651 --> 00:38:45,186
Why are you fighting?

542
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,695
Have you eaten?

543
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,390
I told the newcomer...

544
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:52,695
that only the goodhearted were left.

545
00:38:53,221 --> 00:38:55,036
What is this?

546
00:38:55,631 --> 00:38:56,936
- Sorry... - Just move out!

547
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,876
I'm sorry, ma'am.

548
00:38:59,361 --> 00:39:02,345
All that these boys do is fight.

549
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,845
Repent!

550
00:39:08,611 --> 00:39:12,456
I'm sorry too.

551
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:21,755
I'm Soh Jung Hwa. I booked for 9pm.

552
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,396
Thank you.

553
00:39:25,221 --> 00:39:27,566
- Officer Soh. - Hello.

554
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,591
Your appointment isn't scheduled for today.

555
00:39:29,591 --> 00:39:32,575
Something came up, so I had to change the date.

556
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,730
The dentist on duty for tonight does things less painfully than I do.

557
00:39:35,730 --> 00:39:38,476
- Good luck with your treatment. - Thank you.

558
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,775
Do you have a date?

559
00:39:41,971 --> 00:39:43,215
Well...

560
00:39:43,671 --> 00:39:45,916
I'm meeting someone important today.

561
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,025
I don't know who she is, but good for her.

562
00:39:49,281 --> 00:39:50,686
I'll see you around then.

563
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,896
- Goodnight. - Bye.

564
00:40:03,230 --> 00:40:04,836
(Yu Spring Dentist)

565
00:40:15,471 --> 00:40:16,786
(One Way)

566
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:33,436
It's been only one day, but I don't want to go back in.

567
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:45,370
Hey, you must be getting back from work.

568
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:46,476
Yes.

569
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:49,540
Did you eat dinner? If you didn't, I can cook you eggs.

570
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,715
I had dinner with my colleagues, so I'm okay.

571
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:56,126
I just boiled eggs. Do you want one?

572
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,080
It's really good with a pinch of salt.

573
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,721
I have indigestion.

574
00:40:59,721 --> 00:41:00,956
You do?

575
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:03,290
- Yes. - Gosh. Let me help you with that.

576
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:05,390
- I'm really good with needles. - I don't need that.

577
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,660
I'm just going to rest up.

578
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:09,766
Tell me whenever. I can stab it with the needle for you.

579
00:41:10,961 --> 00:41:12,706
Poor him.

580
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:17,546
Why does she keep offering me to eat eggs?

581
00:41:30,281 --> 00:41:31,786
Goodness.

582
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,965
This place is so tiny.

583
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:39,666
Gosh, I have nothing to do.

584
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,155
Darn it.

585
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:53,135
(Thank you.)

586
00:42:56,631 --> 00:42:58,571
Let's see. This must belong to the previous tenant.

587
00:42:58,571 --> 00:42:59,646
(I'm lonely. I'm tired.)

588
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:03,971
(I'm going crazy. I want to die. I must kill. I'm scared.)

589
00:43:03,971 --> 00:43:05,786
(Die.)

590
00:43:07,341 --> 00:43:09,255
(Die.)

591
00:43:10,711 --> 00:43:11,711
Could it be possible...

592
00:43:11,711 --> 00:43:14,651
I get that this area will be redeveloped,

593
00:43:14,651 --> 00:43:16,266
but how can it be this cheap?

594
00:43:16,790 --> 00:43:18,666
To be honest,

595
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,936
a man who used to live in this room killed himself.

596
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,106
I should forget about it.

597
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:32,046
I should have a can of beer before going to sleep.

598
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,496
(Did you get off work, Ji Eun?)

599
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,445
Hello?

600
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:06,016
Isn't this JH Content?

601
00:44:07,071 --> 00:44:08,246
Pardon?

602
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:11,370
Yes, yes. That's right.

603
00:44:11,370 --> 00:44:13,841
Yu Jung usually picks up the phone.

604
00:44:13,881 --> 00:44:15,080
You must be new.

605
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:19,551
Yes. My name is Yun Jong Woo. I'm an intern.

606
00:44:19,551 --> 00:44:21,551
I see. Im Jong Oh?

607
00:44:21,551 --> 00:44:22,921
No, it's Yun Jong...

608
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:24,950
Im Jong Oh. I got it.

609
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:28,796
Can you send me the information of the show via text message?

610
00:44:28,961 --> 00:44:31,635
Wait. It's...

611
00:44:32,131 --> 00:44:34,936
- Now? - Send it to me quickly. Bye.

612
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,416
What the...

613
00:44:51,611 --> 00:44:58,695
(Eden Studio)

614
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:13,146
What is this place?

615
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,186
Gosh.

616
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,586
- Who are you? - You startled me.

617
00:45:25,781 --> 00:45:27,626
I'm from the police.

618
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,595
- The police? - Do you...

619
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:33,566
know this man?

620
00:45:34,421 --> 00:45:38,261
I was going to wait until tomorrow and make a report then.

621
00:45:38,261 --> 00:45:39,930
- Hold on. - About this man?

622
00:45:39,961 --> 00:45:42,160
No, listen.

623
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,646
- That man. - Yes.

624
00:45:43,971 --> 00:45:46,571
He didn't pay any of the rent.

625
00:45:46,571 --> 00:45:48,941
- His rent? - Yes, he was behind his rent.

626
00:45:48,941 --> 00:45:50,611
- He ran away today. - He lives here?

627
00:45:50,611 --> 00:45:52,611
Yes. He lives in Unit 310.

628
00:45:52,611 --> 00:45:54,480
- Unit 310? Let me take a look. - Okay.

629
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,850
Gosh, I trusted him, but he conned me. Come here.

630
00:45:56,881 --> 00:45:58,925
I can't count how many times I've been conned.

631
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,950
Hey, why is this hallway so dark?

632
00:46:01,950 --> 00:46:05,421
Gosh, the economy is terrible. What good will lights do?

633
00:46:05,421 --> 00:46:06,496
Come here.

634
00:46:07,221 --> 00:46:08,560
- It's a waste. - Is this the room?

635
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:11,491
- Gosh, he drank a lot... - Goodness.

636
00:46:11,531 --> 00:46:13,160
- and broke things. - Okay.

637
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,700
He threatened the tenant next door that he would kill him or something.

638
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:18,671
I should have kicked him out a long time ago,

639
00:46:18,671 --> 00:46:20,600
but I'm a softie.

640
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,671
He disappeared today?

641
00:46:21,671 --> 00:46:25,511
Last night, he got drunk and beat up the guy next door.

642
00:46:25,511 --> 00:46:27,040
- He beat up people? - Yes. I got mad,

643
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,540
so I told him to leave.

644
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:32,151
He must've thought that was his window and left.

645
00:46:32,180 --> 00:46:33,180
Whom did he beat up?

646
00:46:33,180 --> 00:46:35,726
The guy... He's... Goodness.

647
00:46:35,991 --> 00:46:38,126
Hey, Unit 306. Come here.

648
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:40,365
- He's here? - Right here.

649
00:46:40,390 --> 00:46:43,991
He's here to catch the guy in Unit 310. Talk to him.

650
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:45,936
- Talk to him first. - Hello.

651
00:46:47,861 --> 00:46:51,175
Okay. All of a sudden,

652
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:55,370
he told me that I was loud and slapped me on my cheek.

653
00:46:55,370 --> 00:46:56,671
He stutters.

654
00:46:56,671 --> 00:47:00,485
I kept telling him to stop, but you know...

655
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,286
as well...

656
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:07,396
that he has scars and he looks so scary.

657
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:09,991
He does look scary. Good job.

658
00:47:09,991 --> 00:47:11,750
You got beaten up. Is that funny to you?

659
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:14,160
Is that supposed to be funny? Didn't he get beaten up?

660
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,405
He's just mentally unstable.

661
00:47:16,531 --> 00:47:18,166
Okay, I got it.

662
00:47:18,430 --> 00:47:21,235
If he comes back, call me at this number.

663
00:47:21,261 --> 00:47:22,361
We'll try to look for him too.

664
00:47:22,361 --> 00:47:25,031
He beat up people and ran away after not paying the rent.

665
00:47:25,031 --> 00:47:26,301
You have to catch the guy.

666
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:29,115
You should make a report with the local police station.

667
00:47:29,241 --> 00:47:30,810
I have to call the police separately?

668
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:32,115
Goodness.

669
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:36,786
But how do you know this man, Detective?

670
00:47:40,781 --> 00:47:44,525
It looks like he bolted after causing trouble.

671
00:47:48,421 --> 00:47:49,936
Hey. Hold on.

672
00:47:52,031 --> 00:47:53,476
Do you live in that studio?

673
00:47:54,261 --> 00:47:55,405
Yes.

674
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:57,905
I'm from the police.

675
00:47:59,401 --> 00:48:01,215
- Okay. - By any chance,

676
00:48:02,540 --> 00:48:03,816
do you recognize this man?

677
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,615
- This guy... - Do you know him?

678
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:09,825
Well, I didn't know him that well.

679
00:48:10,080 --> 00:48:13,180
I've only talked to him a few times. I just moved in here.

680
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:14,296
I see.

681
00:48:14,680 --> 00:48:18,120
Did you see anything unusual about this guy?

682
00:48:18,151 --> 00:48:19,635
- Unusual? - Yes.

683
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,060
Like he seemed different than before...

684
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,330
or his behaviors were odd or something.

685
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:27,301
Did anything happen to this guy?

686
00:48:27,301 --> 00:48:28,376
Pardon?

687
00:48:30,301 --> 00:48:32,100
Why are you suddenly asking me that?

688
00:48:32,131 --> 00:48:35,770
I mean, you're from the police asking about him.

689
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:38,186
- It's not that. - Okay.

690
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:40,881
He's a wanted man, but he suddenly called us to save him.

691
00:48:40,881 --> 00:48:42,655
- What? - Someone was trying to kill him.

692
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,250
- That's... - What? Did you remember something?

693
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,655
No, no.

694
00:48:48,781 --> 00:48:52,166
- What is it? - He didn't get along with people...

695
00:48:52,390 --> 00:48:53,691
from this studio.

696
00:48:53,691 --> 00:48:55,261
- People living here? - Yes.

697
00:48:55,261 --> 00:48:56,635
What else?

698
00:48:56,691 --> 00:48:59,531
- This is just my opinion. - Okay.

699
00:48:59,531 --> 00:49:02,700
He scared the people here more than he had to.

700
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:04,646
I see. I got it.

701
00:49:05,471 --> 00:49:08,646
But if you remember anything else, call me at this number.

702
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,046
- Okay. - Call me at that number.

703
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:13,180
- Okay. - Sorry about that. Goodnight.

704
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,255
Okay.

705
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:23,996
Young man.

706
00:49:24,591 --> 00:49:27,595
I forgot to tell you. Take your parcel.

707
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:33,836
What?

708
00:49:37,131 --> 00:49:39,246
- Ms. Eom. - What?

709
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:40,775
What's wrong?

710
00:49:40,841 --> 00:49:44,171
This. Look. Did you open it?

711
00:49:44,171 --> 00:49:47,540
No, not me. That wasn't me.

712
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:50,180
The guy in Unit 313 thought it was his...

713
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,485
and opened it.

714
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:55,226
Things like that happen when you live with others.

715
00:49:56,191 --> 00:49:57,465
Don't frown.

716
00:50:02,491 --> 00:50:03,666
Where did I put...

717
00:50:20,111 --> 00:50:22,155
The guy who spat on you.

718
00:50:23,551 --> 00:50:26,651
He has anger management issues. Just ignore such people.

719
00:50:26,651 --> 00:50:29,126
Yes. Let's just let it go.

720
00:50:47,441 --> 00:50:51,516
If they fixed the laptop, couldn't they have...

721
00:50:52,781 --> 00:50:54,516
turned it off afterwards?

722
00:51:02,991 --> 00:51:04,195
Wait.

723
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:06,066
Did that pervert...

724
00:51:16,631 --> 00:51:19,106
(Detective Cha Sung Ryeol)

725
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,345
I'm moving out next week.

726
00:51:21,741 --> 00:51:24,410
I'll go back home and run a fishing place.

727
00:51:24,410 --> 00:51:27,316
That's right. He said he'd go back home.

728
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:33,595
Where did you go?

729
00:51:43,261 --> 00:51:44,606
Do you want to have fun too?

730
00:51:45,191 --> 00:51:46,376
Do you want to die?

731
00:52:20,901 --> 00:52:22,505
Is he gone already?

732
00:52:31,171 --> 00:52:33,586
I have a lot more to do because of you.

733
00:52:34,781 --> 00:52:36,016
I'll be busy.

734
00:52:39,480 --> 00:52:41,095
Whatever. I'm sure it'll be fine.

735
00:53:02,301 --> 00:53:04,985
(Ji Eun)

736
00:55:31,921 --> 00:55:33,766
I'll come straight back after work.

737
00:55:37,261 --> 00:55:41,305
(Volunteers)

738
00:55:41,401 --> 00:55:42,675
You were...

739
00:55:44,270 --> 00:55:45,945
a failure.

740
00:55:47,801 --> 00:55:49,715
I'm creating art.

741
00:55:50,910 --> 00:55:52,416
It's not just murder.

742
00:55:53,381 --> 00:55:54,516
Why...

743
00:55:57,051 --> 00:56:00,755
Why did you do this without my permission?

744
00:56:02,551 --> 00:56:04,025
We have rules, you know.

745
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:31,655
You've done well so far.

746
00:56:33,651 --> 00:56:34,726
Honey.

747
00:56:53,035 --> 00:56:54,940
No, no, it's not that.

748
00:56:55,164 --> 00:56:58,504
Anyway, I think the people here aren't normal.

749
00:56:58,504 --> 00:56:59,610
Perhaps...

750
00:57:00,305 --> 00:57:02,619
you're just overreacting.

751
00:57:03,144 --> 00:57:05,874
- What? - You must be tired.

752
00:57:05,874 --> 00:57:08,960
Don't mind them too much and go to bed.

753
00:57:09,345 --> 00:57:12,385
Ji Eun, if you just hear stories about them,

754
00:57:12,385 --> 00:57:15,024
you'd think I'm worried about nothing.

755
00:57:15,024 --> 00:57:16,655
- If you were to see... - Jong Woo.

756
00:57:16,655 --> 00:57:19,699
I worked from dawn until now and I'm so tired.

757
00:57:20,164 --> 00:57:21,770
Let's talk tomorrow.

758
00:57:22,695 --> 00:57:25,139
- Do you mind? - No, that's fine.

759
00:57:26,164 --> 00:57:27,309
Sleep well.

760
00:57:28,135 --> 00:57:30,279
Okay. You too.

761
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:41,219
Are you the new guy?

762
00:57:42,684 --> 00:57:43,759
Yes.

763
00:57:47,325 --> 00:57:49,124
The landlady told me about you.

764
00:57:49,124 --> 00:57:50,900
You moved into Unit 303.

765
00:57:51,294 --> 00:57:52,429
Yes.

766
00:57:54,465 --> 00:57:55,699
Isn't it nice up here?

767
00:57:56,564 --> 00:58:00,440
The rooms are suffocating, just like a coffin.

768
00:58:01,104 --> 00:58:03,234
If you have a beer up here,

769
00:58:03,234 --> 00:58:04,710
you feel much better.

770
00:58:05,704 --> 00:58:07,020
You would.

771
00:58:13,075 --> 00:58:17,429
Why do you keep smiling at me?

772
00:58:22,925 --> 00:58:24,429
Sorry if that was offensive.

773
00:58:24,825 --> 00:58:25,900
No.

774
00:58:26,894 --> 00:58:28,040
I just...

775
00:58:28,825 --> 00:58:30,509
- like it? - What?

776
00:58:37,434 --> 00:58:41,179
I had a thought when I saw you.

777
00:58:44,874 --> 00:58:46,090
That you...

778
00:58:46,615 --> 00:58:49,820
could be the same type of person as me.

779
00:58:50,184 --> 00:58:51,259
What?

780
00:59:28,925 --> 00:59:31,170
(Stranger from Hell)

781
00:59:31,294 --> 00:59:33,325
There are such people around us.

782
00:59:33,325 --> 00:59:36,465
They look normal on the outside but want to kill on the inside.

783
00:59:36,465 --> 00:59:39,734
No one can open my door without a key, right?

784
00:59:39,734 --> 00:59:41,239
It never opens otherwise.

785
00:59:41,365 --> 00:59:45,175
I want to work on the new guy.

786
00:59:45,175 --> 00:59:48,520
I bet he's very soft.

787
00:59:49,075 --> 00:59:50,949
He said he was scared.

788
00:59:51,015 --> 00:59:55,159
He said some strange people were going to kill him.

789
00:59:55,285 --> 00:59:57,860
The thug suddenly disappeared too.

790
00:59:58,385 --> 00:59:59,860
Isn't that odd?
