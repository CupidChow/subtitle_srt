1
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,249
(All places, names, organizations, groups...)

2
00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:05,124
(and religions in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:01:20,315 --> 00:01:22,360
Am I having indigestion?

4
00:01:22,925 --> 00:01:24,659
I feel so exhausted.

5
00:01:30,395 --> 00:01:33,140
Did something ruin my mood today?

6
00:01:39,105 --> 00:01:43,050
Did I take drugs? What's wrong with my body?

7
00:01:45,575 --> 00:01:48,860
What's going on?

8
00:01:49,145 --> 00:01:50,489
What could it be all of a sudden?

9
00:02:14,604 --> 00:02:16,679
Why do I feel so nauseous?

10
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,250
I need to get my mind together.

11
00:02:49,175 --> 00:02:52,719
Is he really the replacement for Unit 302?

12
00:02:53,544 --> 00:02:56,559
Why? Does he look too weak?

13
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:01,330
Look.

14
00:03:01,585 --> 00:03:02,830
Yes?

15
00:03:03,655 --> 00:03:07,570
Don't judge a book by its cover.

16
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:30,260
Someone was in my room.

17
00:03:33,215 --> 00:03:37,484
(Episode 5. The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge)

18
00:03:37,484 --> 00:03:38,559
Ms. Eom.

19
00:03:39,595 --> 00:03:41,399
Ms. Eom!

20
00:03:41,924 --> 00:03:43,194
Ms. Eom!

21
00:03:43,194 --> 00:03:44,793
I think someone broke into my room.

22
00:03:44,794 --> 00:03:47,794
What do you mean? Nobody lives around here.

23
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:51,664
I'm telling you, someone broke into my room. I'm sure.

24
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:53,734
Who would do that?

25
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,305
That's why I'm asking you to check.

26
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:58,204
The surveillance camera is working, right?

27
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,550
Please check it.

28
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:03,484
I thought you'd be a nice guy, but you have a temper.

29
00:04:03,484 --> 00:04:04,944
Show me how I can check the footage.

30
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:06,555
- Goodness. - Please?

31
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:08,189
It's here.

32
00:04:09,155 --> 00:04:12,160
Goodness, you're bothering me.

33
00:04:13,595 --> 00:04:15,369
It works.

34
00:04:15,394 --> 00:04:17,399
I thought it was too old to work.

35
00:04:17,694 --> 00:04:20,070
Check it using this.

36
00:04:21,664 --> 00:04:25,364
Did you leave your room unlocked when you left?

37
00:04:25,364 --> 00:04:28,174
I made sure to lock it and even checked this morning.

38
00:04:28,174 --> 00:04:29,619
I just have...

39
00:04:30,204 --> 00:04:31,380
What? Go on.

40
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:36,114
I just have a feeling. Here it is.

41
00:04:36,114 --> 00:04:38,820
What feeling?

42
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:46,953
See? No one is there.

43
00:04:46,954 --> 00:04:50,565
You're just being fussy.

44
00:04:50,565 --> 00:04:52,294
I don't believe this.

45
00:04:52,294 --> 00:04:54,140
Who could possibly be there?

46
00:04:59,405 --> 00:05:00,550
My goodness.

47
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:03,449
Who's that man?

48
00:05:04,674 --> 00:05:08,449
That man is doing it again.

49
00:05:10,114 --> 00:05:11,360
I mean,

50
00:05:11,814 --> 00:05:15,155
he sleepwalks, so he just walks around.

51
00:05:15,155 --> 00:05:16,754
You want me to believe that?

52
00:05:16,754 --> 00:05:17,960
What?

53
00:05:19,424 --> 00:05:21,069
Is he opening the door?

54
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:25,770
He was just...

55
00:05:26,434 --> 00:05:28,569
Why isn't this working?

56
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:32,163
It's not working anymore, it's too old.

57
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:34,379
I don't think he unlocked the door.

58
00:05:35,575 --> 00:05:37,744
This won't work.

59
00:05:37,744 --> 00:05:40,174
It must've been the pervert in Unit 313.

60
00:05:40,174 --> 00:05:43,113
It's broken. Jong Woo?

61
00:05:43,114 --> 00:05:46,554
Jong Woo? It's too hot for this.

62
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,215
- Come out. - Jong Woo.

63
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:49,400
Come out.

64
00:05:50,025 --> 00:05:52,900
Come outside.

65
00:05:53,195 --> 00:05:54,999
Open the door!

66
00:05:59,564 --> 00:06:01,910
Calm down.

67
00:06:01,934 --> 00:06:03,809
Hey.

68
00:06:04,164 --> 00:06:06,050
You broke into my room, didn't you?

69
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:08,780
Tell me the truth, I just watched the surveillance camera footage.

70
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:11,749
Ms. Eom,

71
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:14,674
you watched him on the footage with me, didn't you?

72
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:18,689
I saw it, but I'm not sure if he really opened the door.

73
00:06:19,785 --> 00:06:21,414
You broke into my room, didn't you?

74
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,424
- You're not sure yet. - You went into my room.

75
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,585
- Did you or did you not? - Stop it.

76
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:25,955
You want to die, don't you?

77
00:06:25,955 --> 00:06:27,895
- Stop it, you two. - You want to die, don't you?

78
00:06:27,895 --> 00:06:29,400
Just say that you want to die.

79
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:31,494
I'll kill you.

80
00:06:31,494 --> 00:06:33,270
- So you're saying... - Oh my goodness.

81
00:06:33,294 --> 00:06:34,670
that you didn't break into my room?

82
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,205
You did!

83
00:06:36,205 --> 00:06:37,379
What's going on?

84
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:42,850
Calm down.

85
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:48,090
Are you all right?

86
00:07:04,064 --> 00:07:05,394
At that moment,

87
00:07:05,395 --> 00:07:07,610
I realized...

88
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:10,210
why that thug trembled...

89
00:07:10,804 --> 00:07:12,110
at the sight of these men.

90
00:07:18,275 --> 00:07:19,619
I'm terrified.

91
00:07:20,275 --> 00:07:22,819
These people who are smiling at me right now...

92
00:07:24,385 --> 00:07:25,929
are terrifying.

93
00:07:34,854 --> 00:07:37,970
Right. Let's calm down.

94
00:07:38,395 --> 00:07:39,765
Calm down.

95
00:07:39,765 --> 00:07:41,164
Head back to your rooms, everyone.

96
00:07:41,164 --> 00:07:44,910
We're all neighbors.

97
00:07:45,064 --> 00:07:48,275
Have a good night, everyone.

98
00:07:48,275 --> 00:07:51,379
Get your mind together.

99
00:08:00,484 --> 00:08:02,600
Can we talk?

100
00:08:07,994 --> 00:08:09,129
What?

101
00:08:11,494 --> 00:08:12,610
Why?

102
00:08:12,695 --> 00:08:15,095
I just heard a sound coming from here.

103
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:17,535
What sound? I didn't hear anything.

104
00:08:17,535 --> 00:08:20,075
- What? - Didn't you hear that from Ms. Eom?

105
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:21,734
Nobody lives on the fourth floor...

106
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:23,705
- after the fire. - Right.

107
00:08:23,705 --> 00:08:25,579
But I really heard something.

108
00:08:27,544 --> 00:08:30,860
The woman who lived on the fourth floor had a cat, though.

109
00:08:31,184 --> 00:08:35,160
The woman died in the fire, but the cat seems to still stroll around.

110
00:08:35,684 --> 00:08:37,600
Maybe I should set a mousetrap for it.

111
00:08:48,864 --> 00:08:50,980
Isn't this such a great view?

112
00:08:51,604 --> 00:08:53,635
Why did you do that back there?

113
00:08:53,635 --> 00:08:56,145
You don't seem like someone that'd get so worked up.

114
00:08:56,145 --> 00:08:59,743
Has anyone ever broke into your room?

115
00:08:59,744 --> 00:09:03,460
The man in Unit 310 also said that someone broke into his room.

116
00:09:04,314 --> 00:09:08,090
Are you filming me right now?

117
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:11,559
I think you're filming... What are you doing?

118
00:09:12,554 --> 00:09:14,370
Just because you look nice.

119
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,394
Ms. Eom said...

120
00:09:17,394 --> 00:09:21,134
that the surveillance footage didn't show the man break in, right?

121
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:22,194
That's...

122
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:26,179
because the camera broke down right before he broke into my room.

123
00:09:26,305 --> 00:09:29,475
He definitely went inside. I'm sure of it.

124
00:09:29,475 --> 00:09:32,819
Right, everyone who lives here...

125
00:09:32,915 --> 00:09:34,915
is a bit strange.

126
00:09:34,915 --> 00:09:38,290
I'm really sure.

127
00:09:38,415 --> 00:09:42,490
I put dust on my laptop before I left for work.

128
00:09:42,685 --> 00:09:45,685
If someone broke in, the dust would come off the laptop...

129
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,894
and I'd know for sure that someone was in there.

130
00:09:48,894 --> 00:09:52,670
And when I opened the laptop, the dust was gone.

131
00:09:52,935 --> 00:09:55,195
Also, I turned my laptop off, but it was on when I came back.

132
00:09:55,195 --> 00:09:56,805
I understand.

133
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:59,809
I'd do the same if I were you.

134
00:10:03,374 --> 00:10:04,620
But...

135
00:10:05,915 --> 00:10:08,620
you really wanted to kill the man back there, didn't you?

136
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,290
What?

137
00:10:10,585 --> 00:10:12,490
Didn't you?

138
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:15,884
You got a chill of fear,

139
00:10:15,884 --> 00:10:18,654
thinking that the pervert who watches weird videos alone...

140
00:10:18,654 --> 00:10:22,300
broke into your room and touched your stuff, right?

141
00:10:24,295 --> 00:10:28,510
You think you don't fit this place, right?

142
00:10:29,705 --> 00:10:32,309
You think you're different.

143
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,050
But you're scared at the same time.

144
00:10:36,575 --> 00:10:38,650
You're worried that you'll become like one of them.

145
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:42,373
You must be worried that just by living here...

146
00:10:42,374 --> 00:10:44,890
would make you become just as weird.

147
00:10:45,045 --> 00:10:46,160
Isn't that right?

148
00:10:49,685 --> 00:10:51,729
But don't worry.

149
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:54,599
You're different from them.

150
00:10:55,325 --> 00:10:56,800
Unlike the others,

151
00:10:57,024 --> 00:11:00,640
you can do what you want to whenever you want to.

152
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:04,880
Sorry, if you're done talking, I'm going to take this call.

153
00:11:08,274 --> 00:11:10,250
All right.

154
00:11:14,915 --> 00:11:16,120
Hello, Mom.

155
00:11:17,284 --> 00:11:18,945
I'm going to sleep now. What's up?

156
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:20,614
- Jong Woo. - Yes?

157
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:22,760
- Do you have some money? - Money?

158
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:26,199
Your older brother had a seizure.

159
00:11:26,295 --> 00:11:28,425
We're at the emergency now,

160
00:11:28,425 --> 00:11:30,524
but I don't have enough money for his treatment.

161
00:11:30,524 --> 00:11:31,969
Is he severely hurt?

162
00:11:32,494 --> 00:11:33,935
It's nothing serious,

163
00:11:33,935 --> 00:11:36,109
just a tear from the fall.

164
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:42,744
How much do you need?

165
00:11:42,744 --> 00:11:45,004
Do you have 200 to 300 dollars?

166
00:11:45,004 --> 00:11:46,949
Tell me the exact price. How much do you need?

167
00:11:47,575 --> 00:11:51,484
It's fine, I need to use my phone to send the money, so hang up.

168
00:11:51,484 --> 00:11:54,415
Sorry, Jong Woo.

169
00:11:54,415 --> 00:11:57,030
It's fine, don't say that. I'll hang up now.

170
00:12:03,024 --> 00:12:05,599
(300 dollars)

171
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:17,120
(500 dollars)

172
00:12:22,215 --> 00:12:25,359
(The transaction has been completed.)

173
00:12:40,565 --> 00:12:41,709
You're back.

174
00:12:42,465 --> 00:12:45,040
- I'm home. - My granddaughter.

175
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,380
Grandmother.

176
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:51,880
- Do you recognize me? - Are you teasing me?

177
00:12:52,274 --> 00:12:55,890
You thought I wouldn't remember my granddaughter's face?

178
00:12:56,045 --> 00:12:57,959
Grandmother.

179
00:13:00,984 --> 00:13:02,229
Be careful.

180
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:06,969
Don't trust people too much.

181
00:13:07,555 --> 00:13:09,329
Don't trust people.

182
00:13:10,494 --> 00:13:12,240
What do you mean?

183
00:13:15,034 --> 00:13:16,479
Who are you?

184
00:13:18,764 --> 00:13:21,709
- Who are you? - Grandmother.

185
00:13:49,165 --> 00:13:53,050
That man seems friendly, but makes me uncomfortable,

186
00:13:53,404 --> 00:13:54,849
starting with his smile.

187
00:13:56,274 --> 00:13:58,020
I feel so uncomfortable.

188
00:15:12,415 --> 00:15:13,530
See?

189
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:15,929
This is...

190
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:19,199
how you should deal with people like this jerk.

191
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:34,280
Is there anything fun going on?

192
00:15:37,244 --> 00:15:40,089
This place isn't always like this, you must've been startled.

193
00:15:41,244 --> 00:15:44,260
We only have really good men left here, don't you think?

194
00:15:45,114 --> 00:15:47,089
I know what type of person you are.

195
00:15:48,585 --> 00:15:51,024
Smile. I told you to smile.

196
00:15:51,024 --> 00:15:53,229
Don't you think you're being too sensitive?

197
00:15:56,894 --> 00:16:00,240
Don't worry, you're different from them.

198
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:05,439
You can do whatever you want to...

199
00:16:06,305 --> 00:16:07,809
whenever you want to.

200
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,845
Don't you think you're being too sensitive?

201
00:16:13,845 --> 00:16:16,244
We only have really good men left here, don't you think?

202
00:16:16,244 --> 00:16:18,484
This place isn't always like this.

203
00:16:18,484 --> 00:16:20,329
Don't you think you're being too sensitive?

204
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:52,819
Maybe because of this bed, it's uncomfortable to sleep in.

205
00:16:53,884 --> 00:16:56,160
I've been having nightmares every night.

206
00:17:06,494 --> 00:17:08,534
Could it possibly be this man that broke in?

207
00:17:08,534 --> 00:17:11,939
Why are you looking at me like that?

208
00:17:26,654 --> 00:17:29,160
Why are you looking at me like that?

209
00:17:29,754 --> 00:17:31,160
You're making me blush.

210
00:17:32,784 --> 00:17:35,030
Stop laughing, you prick.

211
00:17:37,394 --> 00:17:39,494
You're hilarious.

212
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:42,140
Ji Eun, let's have a talk.

213
00:17:43,465 --> 00:17:44,579
Okay.

214
00:17:48,004 --> 00:17:51,280
Ji Eun, I need to ask you for something.

215
00:17:51,744 --> 00:17:53,175
Can you check if they'll be shooting the making film...

216
00:17:53,175 --> 00:17:54,389
on the set tomorrow...

217
00:17:54,544 --> 00:17:56,619
and go there to interview the actor?

218
00:17:56,744 --> 00:17:57,744
Sorry?

219
00:17:57,744 --> 00:18:00,685
And write up the interview questions by the end of this morning...

220
00:18:00,685 --> 00:18:02,460
and get them confirmed by the actor's agency.

221
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,159
You're going to have to rush. You don't have much time.

222
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:07,794
I think I've already talked to you...

223
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:09,730
regarding my workload here.

224
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:12,465
And because I've already made an appointment for tomorrow,

225
00:18:12,465 --> 00:18:16,579
I'm not going to be able to visit the set tomorrow.

226
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:19,950
What did you say?

227
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,205
Ma'am, I talked to the Marketing Team...

228
00:18:24,205 --> 00:18:25,605
and they're going to be shooting the making film tomorrow.

229
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:28,274
We told the making film staff that we'll be there tomorrow as well.

230
00:18:28,274 --> 00:18:31,889
I asked them to help us out with the interview.

231
00:18:33,385 --> 00:18:36,054
Really? Great job.

232
00:18:36,054 --> 00:18:38,760
Someone else, on the other hand, doesn't even care.

233
00:18:39,155 --> 00:18:40,195
Who?

234
00:18:40,195 --> 00:18:42,230
It's for our team, of course I'm willing to help out.

235
00:18:42,895 --> 00:18:45,540
- Thank you, you may leave now. - Okay.

236
00:18:48,994 --> 00:18:51,379
Ji Eun, did you hear that?

237
00:18:51,804 --> 00:18:53,210
It's for our team.

238
00:18:54,605 --> 00:18:55,680
Yes.

239
00:18:55,975 --> 00:18:57,619
What are we to you?

240
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,250
Are you just seeking to get promoted by doing well alone?

241
00:19:00,945 --> 00:19:04,260
- I... - You're always being left out.

242
00:19:04,814 --> 00:19:06,020
Why are you even at work?

243
00:19:06,385 --> 00:19:07,889
Aren't you here to work together?

244
00:19:11,385 --> 00:19:13,129
(Honey)

245
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:18,139
It's fine, you can pick up. It must be your boyfriend.

246
00:19:18,395 --> 00:19:20,010
- It's fine. - Pick it up.

247
00:19:28,304 --> 00:19:30,119
(Honey)

248
00:19:31,175 --> 00:19:32,905
- Yes, Jong Woo? - Ji Eun,

249
00:19:32,905 --> 00:19:34,645
someone broke into my room yesterday.

250
00:19:34,645 --> 00:19:36,089
- Jong Woo. - I checked the surveillance camera.

251
00:19:38,615 --> 00:19:41,030
Let's talk later, I'm busy right now.

252
00:19:47,294 --> 00:19:48,800
Darn it.

253
00:19:55,935 --> 00:20:00,379
(Are you okay? Did something happen?)

254
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:10,419
Jong Woo.

255
00:20:10,514 --> 00:20:12,984
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

256
00:20:12,984 --> 00:20:15,059
I'm sorry.

257
00:20:16,955 --> 00:20:18,260
Are you not feeling well?

258
00:20:19,054 --> 00:20:21,955
- Me? - You don't seem well.

259
00:20:21,955 --> 00:20:25,599
I didn't get enough sleep last night.

260
00:20:25,695 --> 00:20:26,770
And...

261
00:20:30,105 --> 00:20:31,405
- Thank you. - this belonged to...

262
00:20:31,405 --> 00:20:33,510
the foreigner that lived in the studio before.

263
00:20:34,605 --> 00:20:35,950
- I'll get going now. - Okay.

264
00:20:37,605 --> 00:20:38,950
Jong Woo.

265
00:20:40,044 --> 00:20:44,720
Did anything strange happen at the studio?

266
00:20:46,314 --> 00:20:47,730
- Anything strange? - Yes.

267
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:52,359
Well,

268
00:20:53,655 --> 00:20:56,230
- I was told that... - Go on.

269
00:20:56,965 --> 00:20:59,599
nobody lives on the fourth floor,

270
00:21:00,064 --> 00:21:01,865
but I keep hearing sounds.

271
00:21:01,865 --> 00:21:03,069
What sounds?

272
00:21:03,465 --> 00:21:06,435
Thumping sounds.

273
00:21:06,435 --> 00:21:09,109
- Thumping sounds? - I keep hearing them, but...

274
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,344
Jong Woo?

275
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,109
- I don't know. - What?

276
00:21:20,109 --> 00:21:23,825
- I have to go. - Okay. Goodbye.

277
00:21:31,589 --> 00:21:34,220
It was her. The landlady.

278
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,088
What was she doing over here?

279
00:21:36,089 --> 00:21:37,705
She has no business here.

280
00:21:37,859 --> 00:21:39,305
Why was she here?

281
00:21:40,829 --> 00:21:42,160
Oh, come on.

282
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,900
Mister!

283
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,200
What were you doing?

284
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,369
I'm... Let me...

285
00:21:47,369 --> 00:21:49,299
What do you think you're doing?

286
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:51,109
Are you crazy?

287
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:54,384
Forget it. What a darn morning.

288
00:22:05,462 --> 00:22:06,938
Did you get more eggs?

289
00:22:06,962 --> 00:22:10,178
Yes. The twins just love them.

290
00:22:10,403 --> 00:22:11,807
They don't last a week.

291
00:22:12,502 --> 00:22:14,878
You're just way too caring.

292
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:17,618
What were you doing upstairs?

293
00:22:18,242 --> 00:22:20,718
I think we have mice. I put down some traps.

294
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:22,388
Okay.

295
00:22:22,772 --> 00:22:24,317
By the way.

296
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:28,458
- What? - The guy in Unit 303.

297
00:22:28,583 --> 00:22:31,658
He seems to meet the police girl often.

298
00:22:32,353 --> 00:22:36,267
I think he passed her something this morning.

299
00:22:39,462 --> 00:22:41,192
Did you see what it was?

300
00:22:41,192 --> 00:22:45,037
I was too far away, so no, I didn't.

301
00:22:46,502 --> 00:22:47,908
What shall I do?

302
00:22:48,502 --> 00:22:51,277
Maybe not the 303 guy,

303
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,547
but shall I take care of the police officer?

304
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,988
No. I'll deal with it.

305
00:22:59,543 --> 00:23:00,827
Will you really?

306
00:23:02,452 --> 00:23:04,553
What if something goes wrong and...

307
00:23:04,553 --> 00:23:05,728
Ms. Eom.

308
00:23:08,123 --> 00:23:09,628
Do you not trust me?

309
00:23:11,922 --> 00:23:14,708
Why wouldn't I trust you?

310
00:23:15,192 --> 00:23:17,178
You do as you wish then.

311
00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:20,208
I'll just wait and have some fun.

312
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,918
Are you looking for a room?

313
00:23:29,972 --> 00:23:31,813
Hello. Yes.

314
00:23:31,813 --> 00:23:34,452
Good. Take a look around.

315
00:23:34,452 --> 00:23:35,688
Okay.

316
00:23:36,113 --> 00:23:38,658
It's on the top of a hill.

317
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,893
Summer will be over in a while.

318
00:23:40,893 --> 00:23:42,393
It may be hot,

319
00:23:42,393 --> 00:23:45,067
but it's a nice, energizing walk.

320
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:47,593
I even provide eggs for free.

321
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:50,403
And kimchi that I make myself.

322
00:23:50,403 --> 00:23:52,202
You'll never find a place like this.

323
00:23:52,202 --> 00:23:53,408
Okay.

324
00:23:54,202 --> 00:23:55,202
Look around.

325
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:56,942
Can I think about it?

326
00:23:56,942 --> 00:23:59,878
Why would you do that? What's bothering you?

327
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:02,012
You must've looked around.

328
00:24:02,012 --> 00:24:04,442
You'll never find a room like this at this price.

329
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:05,813
Not in Seoul.

330
00:24:05,813 --> 00:24:08,958
Even so. Did you say it's 200 dollars a month?

331
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:12,658
Why? What's the lowest you've found?

332
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:14,868
I could give you a discount.

333
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:16,728
I see.

334
00:24:16,962 --> 00:24:18,692
I'll think about it.

335
00:24:18,692 --> 00:24:20,932
What's there to think about?

336
00:24:20,932 --> 00:24:23,408
You'll never find a place like this.

337
00:24:24,303 --> 00:24:26,277
It'll be a tough ask.

338
00:24:27,732 --> 00:24:29,577
There's no place like this.

339
00:25:01,133 --> 00:25:04,148
Ma'am? It's me, Bok Soon.

340
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:08,618
Oh, you're lying down.

341
00:25:09,012 --> 00:25:11,813
My goodness. Why did you visit...

342
00:25:11,813 --> 00:25:13,853
so late this month?

343
00:25:13,853 --> 00:25:16,583
Sorry. I'm busy at the studio these days.

344
00:25:16,583 --> 00:25:19,952
Ma'am, I brought something that's good for you.

345
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:21,997
You didn't have to.

346
00:25:22,452 --> 00:25:24,192
- It's good for you. - Oh my.

347
00:25:24,192 --> 00:25:25,823
You didn't have to bring anything.

348
00:25:25,823 --> 00:25:29,293
Drink it all up. It's good for your health.

349
00:25:29,293 --> 00:25:31,133
Finish it all.

350
00:25:31,133 --> 00:25:32,678
That's nice and cold.

351
00:25:33,932 --> 00:25:35,708
It's good for you.

352
00:25:37,502 --> 00:25:39,317
- Did you drink it all? - Yes.

353
00:25:39,603 --> 00:25:42,347
- Now take a nap. - Okay.

354
00:25:42,742 --> 00:25:44,742
You'll feel energized.

355
00:25:44,742 --> 00:25:47,327
I'll help you lie down.

356
00:25:47,583 --> 00:25:49,653
- Oh, dear. - There you go.

357
00:25:49,653 --> 00:25:51,653
You lost so much weight.

358
00:25:51,653 --> 00:25:55,198
- Oh, dear. - Sleep well now.

359
00:26:17,512 --> 00:26:20,787
(Deun Deun Heath Insurance)

360
00:26:26,022 --> 00:26:27,797
Hello.

361
00:26:29,492 --> 00:26:30,698
What's going on?

362
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:32,668
You're alone, Intern?

363
00:26:33,123 --> 00:26:35,093
Yes, the others left for a meeting.

364
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,777
They're so out of it.

365
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:42,148
I guarantee that this place will close in a year.

366
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:44,418
My goodness.

367
00:26:47,972 --> 00:26:49,688
Get me the nail clipper.

368
00:26:49,972 --> 00:26:51,218
What?

369
00:26:51,383 --> 00:26:53,728
The nail clipper in Byung Min's drawer.

370
00:27:04,593 --> 00:27:06,267
What's this?

371
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:08,868
He's a stalker.

372
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:14,007
Thanks.

373
00:27:14,903 --> 00:27:16,208
Do you have anything?

374
00:27:17,242 --> 00:27:18,978
Would you like something to drink?

375
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:21,712
How about some iced coffee?

376
00:27:21,712 --> 00:27:23,418
Let's see how good you are.

377
00:27:24,383 --> 00:27:25,383
Okay.

378
00:27:25,383 --> 00:27:27,857
Some fruit too, if you have any.

379
00:27:34,123 --> 00:27:35,497
Oh, thank you, thank you.

380
00:27:41,232 --> 00:27:42,507
That's great.

381
00:27:43,663 --> 00:27:46,408
You make my coffees from now on.

382
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:50,678
Oh, what did you say you're writing? A play?

383
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:53,547
I write novels.

384
00:27:53,712 --> 00:27:55,047
Novels?

385
00:27:56,913 --> 00:28:00,282
You're an artist then.

386
00:28:00,282 --> 00:28:02,527
No wonder your coffee's a work of art.

387
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:06,257
So what are you writing about?

388
00:28:06,682 --> 00:28:07,992
Crime.

389
00:28:07,992 --> 00:28:11,393
Crime? That's a good topic.

390
00:28:11,393 --> 00:28:13,738
Talk to me if you need any ideas.

391
00:28:14,762 --> 00:28:15,968
Okay.

392
00:28:15,992 --> 00:28:19,607
Right. Didn't you say you live in a shared studio?

393
00:28:19,962 --> 00:28:21,032
Yes.

394
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:24,547
There must be a lot of unique characters there.

395
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:28,047
Who knows? Maybe a serial killer lives there.

396
00:28:29,113 --> 00:28:31,083
Students have it rough these days.

397
00:28:31,083 --> 00:28:33,212
People who are extra stressed out...

398
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:36,012
are more likely to commit crimes.

399
00:28:36,012 --> 00:28:38,653
Imagine a corpse in the room next to yours. That's...

400
00:28:38,653 --> 00:28:40,158
I'd know right away.

401
00:28:40,893 --> 00:28:42,128
What?

402
00:28:42,492 --> 00:28:44,837
I can hear the guy next door breathe.

403
00:28:46,992 --> 00:28:48,368
Can you?

404
00:28:49,363 --> 00:28:51,478
And none of them are students.

405
00:28:52,403 --> 00:28:55,547
Still, that's where the poor live.

406
00:28:56,732 --> 00:28:59,603
The internet cafe murder not so long ago.

407
00:28:59,603 --> 00:29:02,573
The killer's inferiority complex took over, that's why.

408
00:29:02,573 --> 00:29:05,442
I saw lots of guys like him in my journalist career.

409
00:29:05,442 --> 00:29:07,282
If you look at the eyes of guys like him,

410
00:29:07,282 --> 00:29:11,228
they're dark, sunken and freaky.

411
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,992
It's as if they're oppressed.

412
00:29:13,992 --> 00:29:16,027
Where do you think such guys live?

413
00:29:17,893 --> 00:29:19,238
He laughed.

414
00:29:21,293 --> 00:29:22,468
What?

415
00:29:23,093 --> 00:29:24,708
He didn't look oppressed.

416
00:29:25,103 --> 00:29:26,807
He seemed to enjoy it.

417
00:29:32,942 --> 00:29:35,913
- Hello. - What took you guys so long?

418
00:29:35,913 --> 00:29:38,343
- You should've called ahead. - Hello.

419
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:39,757
Where's Mr. Shin?

420
00:29:39,883 --> 00:29:42,587
Mr. Shin? He's not in?

421
00:29:43,952 --> 00:29:46,452
He's so hard to meet.

422
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:48,668
How many visits does it take?

423
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:50,938
I have to go now. Bye.

424
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:52,293
You're leaving already?

425
00:29:52,293 --> 00:29:54,932
Yes. Intern, no, Jong Woo, is it?

426
00:29:54,932 --> 00:29:56,492
He makes great coffee.

427
00:29:56,492 --> 00:29:58,803
I bet he's great at his job too.

428
00:29:58,803 --> 00:30:00,702
Don't see me out. Bye.

429
00:30:00,702 --> 00:30:02,378
Bye. Take care.

430
00:30:06,073 --> 00:30:07,247
Intern.

431
00:30:08,272 --> 00:30:12,181
Did you take the nail clipper from my drawer?

432
00:30:12,182 --> 00:30:13,317
Yes.

433
00:30:13,583 --> 00:30:15,557
Mr. Jo asked for it.

434
00:30:19,782 --> 00:30:21,097
Can I get back to work?

435
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:28,638
Where's Mr. Shin?

436
00:30:29,293 --> 00:30:31,307
I don't know. Give him a call.

437
00:30:33,762 --> 00:30:34,878
Here.

438
00:30:36,873 --> 00:30:39,148
Should I start a business?

439
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:42,888
How is Jong Woo doing?

440
00:30:43,113 --> 00:30:45,188
You're asking about him as soon as we meet?

441
00:30:45,413 --> 00:30:47,413
You're so loving.

442
00:30:47,413 --> 00:30:52,228
He's been acting a bit weird since he moved to Seoul.

443
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:54,997
I'm not the only one who thinks so.

444
00:30:55,192 --> 00:30:58,368
He turns nasty whenever I mention where he stays.

445
00:30:59,093 --> 00:31:00,807
Is something happening there?

446
00:31:01,163 --> 00:31:03,208
What could possibly happen?

447
00:31:03,692 --> 00:31:05,403
He's nasty because he lives in a shared studio.

448
00:31:05,403 --> 00:31:07,978
- And feels sorry for himself. - That's not nice.

449
00:31:09,303 --> 00:31:11,678
Be nice to him at work.

450
00:31:11,702 --> 00:31:15,148
Hey. No boss in the world is as nice as I am.

451
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,918
His supervisor seems to be bugging him.

452
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:20,188
Tell him to lay it off.

453
00:31:20,982 --> 00:31:22,958
My supervisor's giving me a hard time too.

454
00:31:23,212 --> 00:31:26,057
Okay, fine. Can you not nag?

455
00:31:29,722 --> 00:31:32,297
So, does your supervisor bother you that much?

456
00:31:35,133 --> 00:31:36,267
What is it?

457
00:31:38,762 --> 00:31:40,878
Gosh, you're really stressed out.

458
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:48,218
- Here are your coffees. - You didn't have to.

459
00:31:48,313 --> 00:31:50,287
This is nothing.

460
00:31:50,543 --> 00:31:52,888
They'll glare at you for going out during work hours.

461
00:31:53,043 --> 00:31:54,083
Thanks.

462
00:31:54,083 --> 00:31:56,228
A senior can do this much for you.

463
00:31:56,752 --> 00:31:59,997
- I'll treat you properly one day. - Forget about it.

464
00:32:00,422 --> 00:32:01,728
- Bye. - Take care.

465
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:04,093
Let's have a drink with Jong Woo.

466
00:32:04,093 --> 00:32:06,422
- Okay. Thanks for lunch. - I'll call you.

467
00:32:06,422 --> 00:32:07,507
Bye.

468
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:10,007
Your boyfriend?

469
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:11,938
Ma'am.

470
00:32:13,063 --> 00:32:14,208
Oh, no.

471
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,678
No? No wonder.

472
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:20,448
He's just a senior from college.

473
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:23,517
Does he work nearby?

474
00:32:25,282 --> 00:32:26,883
He has a business in Daehangno...

475
00:32:26,883 --> 00:32:28,988
and had a meeting in the area.

476
00:32:29,383 --> 00:32:30,757
Do you want coffee?

477
00:32:31,182 --> 00:32:32,357
Daehangno?

478
00:32:34,093 --> 00:32:35,497
Does your boyfriend know?

479
00:32:36,422 --> 00:32:37,497
What?

480
00:32:38,593 --> 00:32:40,638
Are you clueless...

481
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,267
or are you playing the field?

482
00:32:43,593 --> 00:32:46,638
Anyone can tell that he likes you.

483
00:32:48,373 --> 00:32:49,777
It's not like that.

484
00:32:52,073 --> 00:32:54,587
If you want, shall I introduce him to you?

485
00:32:54,972 --> 00:32:58,317
I think he'd suit you more than me.

486
00:32:59,682 --> 00:33:01,287
Sure, go ahead.

487
00:33:02,913 --> 00:33:04,698
What, you don't want to lose him?

488
00:33:06,182 --> 00:33:07,698
No, not at all.

489
00:33:08,252 --> 00:33:11,492
You're doing a good deed for your senior then.

490
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:12,567
Thank you.

Darn it. I'll kill you!

494
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:39,357
Why get so worked up when it was bound to fall?

495
00:33:40,053 --> 00:33:43,198
Come on now. How about making a bet?

496
00:33:43,393 --> 00:33:45,668
- What bet? - A slap on the wrist.

498
00:33:53,233 --> 00:33:56,977
I was told that nobody lives on the fourth floor,

499
00:33:57,302 --> 00:33:59,273
but I keep hearing sounds.

500
00:33:59,273 --> 00:34:01,618
- What sounds? - Thumping sounds.

501
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,302

505
00:39:07,882 --> 00:39:08,957
Go on.

506
00:39:10,753 --> 00:39:11,897
Open up!

507
00:39:26,932 --> 00:39:28,507
Wait, wait.

508
00:39:32,873 --> 00:39:34,047
Die, die.

509
00:39:39,913 --> 00:39:42,058
Darn! What's going on up there?

510
00:39:58,663 --> 00:39:59,738
Darn it.

511
00:40:01,902 --> 00:40:03,047
How annoying.

512
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,317

513
00:40:24,693 --> 00:40:28,167
Please save me. Please.

514
00:40:28,362 --> 00:40:30,038
You are severely hurt.

515
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:33,463
- Help me. - Your hands are severely wounded.

516
00:40:33,463 --> 00:40:34,777
Please help me.

517
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,308
I hurt my legs, and I can't walk.

518
00:40:38,902 --> 00:40:40,118
Please help me.

519
00:40:43,813 --> 00:40:45,118
Then you should crawl.

520
00:40:46,813 --> 00:40:48,027
What?

521
00:40:50,313 --> 00:40:51,457
What's wrong?

522
00:40:52,152 --> 00:40:53,627
Don't you want to live?

523
00:40:55,793 --> 00:40:58,498
If you want to live, you need to crawl.

524
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,917
I think the blood is still circulating in your body.

525
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:21,388
I heard about you from Ms. Eom.

526
00:41:21,983 --> 00:41:24,598
You two were like sisters in praying groups.

527
00:41:24,853 --> 00:41:27,598
I am sorry. I am sorry.

528
00:41:27,793 --> 00:41:29,397
I am sorry.

529
00:41:29,592 --> 00:41:33,238
I am sorry. I am sorry.

530
00:41:35,432 --> 00:41:38,937
I am sorry. I am sorry.

531
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:41,448
What are you praying for?

532
00:41:42,472 --> 00:41:44,147
You'll die anyway.

533
00:41:44,702 --> 00:41:47,618
I am sorry. I am sorry.

534
00:41:52,083 --> 00:41:55,658
I am sorry. I am sorry.

535
00:41:56,213 --> 00:41:59,457
I brought this mushroom water just for you.

536
00:42:00,253 --> 00:42:04,352
Once you drink this, you'll be dead in no time.

537
00:42:04,353 --> 00:42:07,297
You are lucky.

538
00:42:38,837 --> 00:42:40,936
Good job this week as well, everyone.

539
00:42:40,936 --> 00:42:42,337
- Good job. - Good.

540
00:42:42,337 --> 00:42:45,047
It must have been a very long first week for you, Jong Woo.

541
00:42:45,047 --> 00:42:46,147
Good work.

542
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,947
Please take good care of Jong Woo.

543
00:42:47,947 --> 00:42:49,717
He did well. Right, Byung Min?

544
00:42:49,717 --> 00:42:51,817
Please take good care of Jong Woo.

545
00:42:51,817 --> 00:42:54,147
- For the next round, we can go... - Hello?

546
00:42:54,147 --> 00:42:56,162
- to the bar that we didn't go... - Hello?

547
00:42:56,857 --> 00:42:58,332
There may be a lot of people.

548
00:42:58,456 --> 00:42:59,627
- Hello? - Please buy some flowers.

549
00:42:59,627 --> 00:43:00,627
No thanks.

550
00:43:00,627 --> 00:43:02,697
- Hello? - Think of it as helping a person...

551
00:43:02,697 --> 00:43:03,901
- in need. - Hello?

552
00:43:04,127 --> 00:43:05,567
- Please help. - Sure.

553
00:43:05,567 --> 00:43:07,225
How much is it?

554
00:43:07,226 --> 00:43:09,496
- It's five dollars. - Five dollars?

555
00:43:09,496 --> 00:43:11,135
Are you going to give it to your girlfriend?

556
00:43:11,136 --> 00:43:14,305
It just reminded me of my mom back in Busan.

557
00:43:14,306 --> 00:43:15,607
Here.

558
00:43:15,607 --> 00:43:17,337
Jong Woo has a warm heart.

559
00:43:17,337 --> 00:43:19,622
Are you trying to show off what a great son you are?

560
00:43:22,746 --> 00:43:24,616
Maybe I should have bought one too.

561
00:43:24,616 --> 00:43:26,147
- For my mom. - That grandma probably...

562
00:43:26,147 --> 00:43:27,817
- drives an expensive car. - You can have it.

563
00:43:27,817 --> 00:43:28,956
Do you even own a car?

564
00:43:28,956 --> 00:43:31,432
You don't even have a car.

565
00:43:31,757 --> 00:43:33,386
Can I really have it?

566
00:43:33,386 --> 00:43:34,502
Sure.

567
00:43:36,427 --> 00:43:38,602
Can I really have it, Jong Woo?

568
00:43:39,197 --> 00:43:40,401
Sure.

569
00:43:43,436 --> 00:43:45,011
Please buy some flowers.

570
00:43:45,136 --> 00:43:46,706
Welcome.

571
00:43:46,706 --> 00:43:47,976
How much is it?

572
00:43:47,976 --> 00:43:49,211
It's 10 dollars.

573
00:43:49,436 --> 00:43:52,346
Would you like this for your sashimi, perhaps?

574
00:43:52,346 --> 00:43:55,292
What about this butterfish? It's really good.

575
00:43:56,877 --> 00:43:58,191
Why did you come here?

576
00:43:59,686 --> 00:44:01,191
I am going to Seoul.

577
00:44:01,217 --> 00:44:02,717
You are going to Seoul now?

578
00:44:02,717 --> 00:44:04,461
Not now.

579
00:44:04,956 --> 00:44:09,102
A guy I knew from college is going to get me a job.

580
00:44:09,326 --> 00:44:10,326
Really?

581
00:44:10,326 --> 00:44:11,542
Yes.

582
00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:14,472
Oh my goodness. My son finally gets a job!

583
00:44:15,036 --> 00:44:17,312
Great. I am happy for you.

584
00:44:17,567 --> 00:44:19,111
All right. I am just here to let you know.

585
00:44:19,136 --> 00:44:20,441
All right.

586
00:44:21,306 --> 00:44:22,511
Jong Woo.

587
00:44:23,076 --> 00:44:25,551
He must be a really good man.

588
00:44:25,877 --> 00:44:27,306
You should be nice to him.

589
00:44:27,306 --> 00:44:30,616
If it weren't for Yu Jung, the guys would be able...

590
00:44:30,616 --> 00:44:32,691
to have a good time. Right?

591
00:44:33,246 --> 00:44:35,757
Hey. What do you think of Yu Jung?

592
00:44:35,757 --> 00:44:36,932
What?

593
00:44:36,987 --> 00:44:38,801
I think she likes you.

594
00:44:38,826 --> 00:44:41,027
She was thrilled when you gave her that flower.

595
00:44:41,027 --> 00:44:43,027
I have Ji Eun.

596
00:44:43,027 --> 00:44:45,225
And Yu Jung is not that kind of person.

597
00:44:45,226 --> 00:44:47,602
Here he makes a straight face again.

598
00:44:48,797 --> 00:44:51,171
You really need to fix that.

599
00:44:51,407 --> 00:44:53,312
You're so dense.

600
00:44:55,036 --> 00:44:56,211
What is it that you want to say?

601
00:44:57,306 --> 00:44:59,846
Can I...

602
00:44:59,846 --> 00:45:02,547
stay at your place...

603
00:45:02,547 --> 00:45:04,076
from today until this weekend?

604
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,647
It really can't go back to that studio.

605
00:45:05,647 --> 00:45:08,591
Sorry. I got work to do over the weekend.

606
00:45:08,686 --> 00:45:11,056
And I don't have guests over at my place. You know that.

607
00:45:11,056 --> 00:45:13,361
Why? Is the studio undergoing some construction?

608
00:45:13,726 --> 00:45:15,127
No, the people at my studio...

609
00:45:15,127 --> 00:45:17,197
They have no space. We should try somewhere else.

610
00:45:17,197 --> 00:45:19,127
- No seats. - Darn it.

611
00:45:19,127 --> 00:45:22,567
Remember the place that we went to last week? It was really spacious.

612
00:45:22,567 --> 00:45:24,067
They have darts too.

613
00:45:24,067 --> 00:45:26,407
- Let's just go to a pub. - That sounds good.

614
00:45:26,407 --> 00:45:29,312
So old-fashioned! Pubs? Seriously?

615
00:45:29,337 --> 00:45:32,146
I was really sick of old-fashioned team dinner.

616
00:45:32,147 --> 00:45:34,452
I am so glad you joined us, Jong Woo.

617
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,961
(Don't you just want to kill him?)

618
00:45:46,686 --> 00:45:48,171
Then they were together!

619
00:45:53,427 --> 00:45:54,671
What was that?

620
00:46:22,427 --> 00:46:25,202
If it's really him, then what should I say?

621
00:46:25,397 --> 00:46:27,301
Should I just call the police?

622
00:46:27,866 --> 00:46:30,571
No, no.

623
00:46:31,567 --> 00:46:34,281
He didn't do anything. What am I going to tell the police?

624
00:46:35,136 --> 00:46:37,312
It was definitely him.

625
00:47:07,837 --> 00:47:09,711
I was really popular.

626
00:47:09,877 --> 00:47:12,806
I am not joking. I was really popular in college.

627
00:47:12,806 --> 00:47:14,147
Don't be silly.

628
00:47:14,147 --> 00:47:16,447
The girls were... Come on, you say it.

629
00:47:16,447 --> 00:47:17,947
He is my witness.

630
00:47:17,947 --> 00:47:19,317
- Jong Woo should know. - Of course.

631
00:47:19,317 --> 00:47:20,846
We went to school together.

632
00:47:20,846 --> 00:47:22,157
He is not saying anything.

633
00:47:22,157 --> 00:47:23,616
Stop harassing such a nice guy!

634
00:47:23,616 --> 00:47:26,657
I used to date the school's model.

635
00:47:26,657 --> 00:47:29,232
Right, Jong Woo? Remember Lee Do Oak?

636
00:47:29,326 --> 00:47:31,226
Lee Do Oak from class of 2008, remember?

637
00:47:31,226 --> 00:47:33,226
- Remember? See? - Really?

638
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:34,297
- She was really pretty. - Is it true?

639
00:47:34,297 --> 00:47:35,337
She was really popular.

640
00:47:35,337 --> 00:47:37,136
You have your own charms.

641
00:47:37,136 --> 00:47:38,237
- I told you. - What do you mean?

642
00:47:38,237 --> 00:47:39,806
Me? He is good-looking.

643
00:47:39,806 --> 00:47:41,837
Girls like guys who look manly,

644
00:47:41,837 --> 00:47:43,237
not just good-looking.

645
00:47:43,237 --> 00:47:44,806
- That's why I was popular. - No way.

646
00:47:44,806 --> 00:47:47,051
Who said you were manly-looking?

647
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:50,691
If we were in school, you would be in trouble.

648
00:47:53,147 --> 00:47:54,246
He said he doesn't need it.

649
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:57,062
- He chased after her... - That's enough.

650
00:47:57,516 --> 00:47:58,857
telling her he'd buy her shoes.

651
00:47:58,857 --> 00:48:00,526
That's enough.

652
00:48:00,527 --> 00:48:01,801
I think that was his trick.

653
00:48:04,297 --> 00:48:08,511
His other tactic was to offer them to buy meals.

654
00:48:08,837 --> 00:48:10,312
Don't cross the line.

655
00:48:10,567 --> 00:48:12,306
He would offer to buy meat.

656
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,412
Hey!

657
00:48:13,737 --> 00:48:15,752
He must have been rich!

658
00:48:17,136 --> 00:48:18,976
He would meet them every day.

659
00:48:18,976 --> 00:48:20,777
He must have lost his mind.

660
00:48:20,777 --> 00:48:22,516
He would chase after them every day.

661
00:48:22,516 --> 00:48:24,122
I guess he has a lot on his mind.

662
00:48:24,677 --> 00:48:26,662
Should we end it here?

663
00:48:26,846 --> 00:48:29,292
- Let me go to the bathroom. - Sure.

664
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,357
Mr. Shin!

665
00:48:32,357 --> 00:48:34,027
He's going to the bathroom alone!

666
00:48:34,027 --> 00:48:35,502
Please pay before we come back.

667
00:48:35,927 --> 00:48:37,527
Mr. Shin, I will go with you.

668
00:48:37,527 --> 00:48:40,372
He had so many tricks.

669
00:48:41,527 --> 00:48:44,312
Jong Woo, are you okay?

670
00:48:45,936 --> 00:48:48,011
He is lucky.

671
00:48:48,136 --> 00:48:51,182
I will pay for the table and be right back.

672
00:48:52,576 --> 00:48:55,647
He had tricks to seduce women.

673
00:48:55,647 --> 00:48:56,821
I shouldn't forget this.

674
00:49:00,416 --> 00:49:02,432
Where is she going?

675
00:49:09,297 --> 00:49:11,772
It's you, Byung Min.

676
00:49:13,967 --> 00:49:16,912
You know, Byung Min...

677
00:49:19,407 --> 00:49:20,482
I am going...

678
00:49:21,237 --> 00:49:23,651
to say one thing tonight.

679
00:49:25,306 --> 00:49:27,982
Byung...Byun Min.

680
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,491
Don't...

681
00:49:32,647 --> 00:49:36,832
look at other woman's buttocks at work.

682
00:49:37,916 --> 00:49:40,162
What are you, pervert?

683
00:49:42,027 --> 00:49:46,042
How dare you? Did you see me doing that?

684
00:49:46,897 --> 00:49:48,697
- Guys! - I am going...

685
00:49:48,697 --> 00:49:50,337
- to report on you! - Mr. Park!

686
00:49:50,337 --> 00:49:51,866
That is sexual harassment.

687
00:49:51,866 --> 00:49:54,407
Come out now. Mr. Shin is in a fight.

688
00:49:54,407 --> 00:49:56,381
- I will talk to you later. - Hurry up!

689
00:49:57,576 --> 00:49:58,877
- You can just call us. - This can't be washed.

690
00:49:58,877 --> 00:50:00,647
- How much is it? - We'll compensate.

691
00:50:00,647 --> 00:50:01,717
- It's expensive, you jerk! - Come on.

692
00:50:01,717 --> 00:50:03,516
- Let's not make a big deal. - Come, hit me!

693
00:50:03,516 --> 00:50:05,217
- Hey, come here! - Mr. Shin, that's enough.

694
00:50:05,217 --> 00:50:07,047
- Get out of my way. - Let me talk to him.

695
00:50:07,047 --> 00:50:08,217
- Come, hit me. - Let's all calm down.

696
00:50:08,217 --> 00:50:09,487
- Are you rich? - I apologize.

697
00:50:09,487 --> 00:50:10,956
- What are you doing? - I apologize on his behalf.

698
00:50:10,956 --> 00:50:12,562
- I apologize on his behalf. - Come on.

699
00:50:12,657 --> 00:50:14,357
- It was a mistake. - You come here.

700
00:50:14,357 --> 00:50:15,757
- You come here. - Just hit me.

701
00:50:15,757 --> 00:50:16,757
- I am sorry. - You should apologize.

702
00:50:16,757 --> 00:50:17,826
- What? - I said you should apologize!

703
00:50:17,826 --> 00:50:19,027
- Come on. - Hit me.

704
00:50:19,027 --> 00:50:20,341
- Stop it. - Come on, Mr. Shin.

705
00:50:21,096 --> 00:50:22,812
- What was that? - What was that?

706
00:50:24,596 --> 00:50:25,982
- Bring it on, then. - Jong Woo.

707
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,211
Jong Woo.

708
00:50:28,377 --> 00:50:29,806
I said, bring it on.

709
00:50:29,806 --> 00:50:31,107
- Jong Woo. - Jong Woo.

710
00:50:31,107 --> 00:50:32,877
- Hey, hey. - I said, bring it on.

711
00:50:32,877 --> 00:50:35,252
- Hey. - Jong Woo, come on.

712
00:50:35,547 --> 00:50:38,091
- Hey, hey. - Sit down, Jong Woo.

713
00:50:40,616 --> 00:50:42,531
That is disgusting.

714
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,961
What are you, a child?

715
00:50:45,527 --> 00:50:48,131
Why do you pick a fight with strangers?

716
00:50:48,226 --> 00:50:50,326
You could really get into trouble.

717
00:50:50,326 --> 00:50:52,372
I knew he was like this from the first time I saw him.

718
00:50:52,596 --> 00:50:54,726
He is crazy.

719
00:50:54,726 --> 00:50:56,272
- Just stay here. - That's too harsh.

720
00:50:56,837 --> 00:50:58,237
- Jong Woo. - What should we do?

721
00:50:58,237 --> 00:50:59,467
- Jong Woo. - Get ahold of yourself!

722
00:50:59,467 --> 00:51:01,241
Get up, Jong Woo.

723
00:51:01,666 --> 00:51:03,007
I didn't expect to see this side of him.

724
00:51:03,007 --> 00:51:04,377
1, 2, 3.

725
00:51:04,377 --> 00:51:07,246
- Try to stand up on your legs. - Taxi!

726
00:51:07,246 --> 00:51:09,091
- It's time to go home. - What's his address?

727
00:51:09,217 --> 00:51:11,116
- Address? - Your address.

728
00:51:11,116 --> 00:51:12,786
- Address? - Mr. Park.

729
00:51:12,786 --> 00:51:15,886
Ji Eun, Jong Woo is really drunk.

730
00:51:15,886 --> 00:51:17,131
You should go home.

731
00:51:17,416 --> 00:51:18,832
- Do you know his address? - Taxi!

732
00:51:19,226 --> 00:51:22,801
Just tell the driver it's Eden Studio.

733
00:51:23,226 --> 00:51:25,096
I see. I got it.

734
00:51:25,096 --> 00:51:26,697
- Careful. - Don't worry too much.

735
00:51:26,697 --> 00:51:28,496
- We will send him. - Wait, wait.

736
00:51:28,496 --> 00:51:30,467
Jong Woo, come on.

737
00:51:30,467 --> 00:51:32,306
- Get in. - It's Eden Studio.

738
00:51:32,306 --> 00:51:33,837
- Hold on. - You need to get into the taxi.

739
00:51:33,837 --> 00:51:36,482
- Come on. - Wait.

740
00:51:39,246 --> 00:51:41,381
Just in a moment, sir.

741
00:51:42,076 --> 00:51:43,352
What are you saying?

742
00:51:43,677 --> 00:51:44,921
Then...

743
00:51:45,947 --> 00:51:48,761
can I just...

744
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:52,932
stay at your place today?

745
00:51:53,487 --> 00:51:55,002
He is really drunk.

746
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,797
Tomorrow morning you'll see what kind of mess you were.

747
00:51:58,797 --> 00:51:59,972
Go home!

748
00:52:00,067 --> 00:52:01,897
- Get him in. - Jong Woo, go home.

749
00:52:01,897 --> 00:52:03,472
I got him.

750
00:52:03,797 --> 00:52:05,482
Watch your head.

751
00:52:09,206 --> 00:52:10,852
- Drive him home safe, sir. - Sure.

752
00:52:16,976 --> 00:52:19,022
Let's see. Eden Studio.

753
00:52:20,746 --> 00:52:21,892
Excuse me.

754
00:52:22,587 --> 00:52:23,691
Sir?

755
00:52:24,987 --> 00:52:27,562
I don't see the address on the navigation.

756
00:52:28,527 --> 00:52:29,631
Excuse me.

757
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:32,642
Is your address really Eden Studio?

758
00:52:34,366 --> 00:52:37,071
Sir? This is not good.

759
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:40,341
- Eden Studio? - Sir.

760
00:52:40,467 --> 00:52:41,611
Where is it?

761
00:52:42,237 --> 00:52:44,151
Can I get off here?

762
00:52:47,177 --> 00:52:49,051
I don't want to go there.

763
00:52:51,447 --> 00:52:53,421
- Jae Ho. - Yes, Ji Eun.

764
00:52:54,647 --> 00:52:56,261
I sent Jong Woo to the studio.

765
00:52:59,027 --> 00:53:00,102
Well...

766
00:53:01,456 --> 00:53:03,671
- Can I see you? - What?

767
00:53:06,527 --> 00:53:07,841
Where are you now?

768
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:11,111
I am on my way. To you.

769
00:53:13,967 --> 00:53:17,482
Sir, can you make a u-turn over there?

770
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:27,861
Sir?

771
00:53:28,757 --> 00:53:29,961
Is that saliva?

772
00:53:30,587 --> 00:53:32,031
Is that all saliva?

773
00:53:32,286 --> 00:53:34,261
Sir? Wake up! Sir?

774
00:53:34,386 --> 00:53:37,171
Sir! Excuse me!

775
00:53:37,427 --> 00:53:39,067
I will sleep at Ji Eun's house.

776
00:53:39,067 --> 00:53:40,841
What is he talking about? This is driving me crazy.

777
00:53:43,067 --> 00:53:44,272
Seriously.

778
00:53:45,907 --> 00:53:48,852
Sir, the cab fare is 10 dollars.

779
00:53:49,337 --> 00:53:51,582
- I am going to take... - I won't go back.

780
00:53:51,877 --> 00:53:54,421
Sure, sure, I got you.

781
00:53:55,277 --> 00:53:56,421
I will take the cab fare. Okay?

782
00:53:56,976 --> 00:53:59,591
Sir, you are home.

783
00:53:59,717 --> 00:54:01,091
Sir, you need to get up.

784
00:54:01,717 --> 00:54:04,792
What? You are at home. Watch your step.

785
00:54:04,987 --> 00:54:06,162
Get up.

786
00:54:06,627 --> 00:54:08,456
All right. Here. Here.

787
00:54:08,456 --> 00:54:09,897
I will sleep at Ji Eun's place.

788
00:54:09,897 --> 00:54:11,927
I have no idea what you are talking about. Come on.

789
00:54:11,927 --> 00:54:14,671
Sir, this way.

790
00:54:14,766 --> 00:54:17,171
- Careful! - It's all good.

791
00:54:18,607 --> 00:54:20,366
What happened?

792
00:54:20,366 --> 00:54:22,312
What did this guy say?

793
00:54:22,576 --> 00:54:24,837
His address was wrong, so I asked him for the address.

794
00:54:24,837 --> 00:54:28,352
But then he kept trying to get off, telling me he can't go back home.

795
00:54:28,877 --> 00:54:31,292
And he drooled all over the backseat.

796
00:54:32,016 --> 00:54:33,261
So I brought him here.

797
00:54:34,186 --> 00:54:36,786
I know him well, so I will take care of him.

798
00:54:36,786 --> 00:54:38,131
Thank you.

799
00:54:38,257 --> 00:54:39,502
He must be like this often, right?

800
00:54:39,927 --> 00:54:41,562
- Sure. - I see.

801
00:54:42,096 --> 00:54:44,397
- It's peak hours, so I need to go. - Sure.

802
00:54:44,397 --> 00:54:45,697
- Thank you. - Thank you.

803
00:54:45,697 --> 00:54:46,897
- Goodnight. - Thank you.

804
00:54:46,897 --> 00:54:48,772
I can't go back to that studio.

805
00:54:51,366 --> 00:54:52,511
Studio...

806
00:54:53,737 --> 00:54:54,812
Studio...

807
00:54:58,746 --> 00:55:00,281
Where did it begin?

808
00:55:03,516 --> 00:55:05,421
At what point did everything go wrong?

809
00:55:11,717 --> 00:55:13,531
If I hadn't come to this horrible place,

810
00:55:16,996 --> 00:55:18,071
If I hadn't...

811
00:55:32,076 --> 00:55:33,921
I can't go back to the studio.

812
00:55:37,016 --> 00:55:38,861
Would there have been a good place for me too?

813
00:55:43,016 --> 00:55:47,602
(Ji Eun)

814
00:56:03,337 --> 00:56:05,051
Why isn't he picking up?

815
00:56:47,916 --> 00:56:50,091
- Jae Ho. - Well...

816
00:56:51,657 --> 00:56:53,702
- Can I see you? - What?

817
00:56:56,657 --> 00:56:57,932
Where are you now?

818
00:56:59,067 --> 00:57:01,241
I am on my way. To you.

819
00:57:01,996 --> 00:57:05,011
Sorry, I should go to Jong Woo.

820
00:57:05,967 --> 00:57:07,082
Sir,

821
00:57:07,806 --> 00:57:09,551
can you make a u-turn over there?

822
00:57:21,587 --> 00:57:27,361
(Eden Studio)

823
00:57:29,596 --> 00:57:31,272
Wake him up.

824
00:57:39,666 --> 00:57:40,741
Jong Woo.

825
00:57:42,067 --> 00:57:44,211
Jong Woo. Jong Woo.

826
00:57:44,837 --> 00:57:45,952
Jong Woo...

827
00:57:47,346 --> 00:57:48,482
Are you okay?

828
00:57:52,817 --> 00:57:54,191
Eden Studio.

829
00:57:56,087 --> 00:57:58,792
What's going on over there?

830
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:18,452
I am scared.

831
00:58:21,076 --> 00:58:22,151
I am...

832
00:58:24,717 --> 00:58:25,921
really scared.

833
00:58:31,987 --> 00:58:33,432
The residents of that studio...

834
00:58:36,056 --> 00:58:37,671
are all very strange.

835
00:58:49,007 --> 00:58:51,852
(Jong Woo, I am at the studio. I'll go to your room.)

836
00:58:52,306 --> 00:58:53,381
Ji Eun!

837
00:58:56,047 --> 00:58:57,222
Can I help you?

838
00:59:00,186 --> 00:59:01,321
Who are you?

839
00:59:04,157 --> 00:59:05,662
You came to see Jong Woo.

840
00:59:49,237 --> 00:59:51,571
(Stranger from Hell)

841
00:59:52,536 --> 00:59:54,907
- Flies are getting attracted. - Ji Eun!

842
00:59:54,907 --> 00:59:57,407
Shouldn't we wrap things up and quit?

843
00:59:57,407 --> 00:59:59,076
That woman gives off a bad vibe.

844
00:59:59,076 --> 01:00:01,746
They will have a leader who orchestrates everything.

845
01:00:01,746 --> 01:00:02,947
- A leader? - Hey.

846
01:00:02,947 --> 01:00:04,522
There are more of us.

847
01:00:04,547 --> 01:00:07,122
You, me, your older brother.

848
01:00:08,317 --> 01:00:09,987
- Who is it? - I just moved...

849
01:00:09,987 --> 01:00:11,616
the room across the hallway.

850
01:00:11,616 --> 01:00:13,961
I smiled and spoke to you nicely.

851
01:00:14,087 --> 01:00:15,531
Do you think I'm a joke?

852
01:00:18,897 --> 01:00:20,142
Is anyone there?
