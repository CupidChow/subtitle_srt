1
00:00:16,937 --> 00:00:19,937
(All places, names, organizations, groups...)

2
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:22,953
(and religions in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,132
I see.

4
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:29,143
Okay.

5
00:00:32,637 --> 00:00:33,782
I want to see him.

6
00:00:35,508 --> 00:00:37,553
I'll come straight back after work.

7
00:00:39,177 --> 00:00:40,422
This should be fun.

8
00:01:14,378 --> 00:01:15,482
Hello.

9
00:01:16,247 --> 00:01:17,822
I'll deal with things here.

10
00:01:35,167 --> 00:01:36,443
You were...

11
00:01:38,038 --> 00:01:39,613
a failure.

12
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:44,253
I'm creating art.

13
00:01:45,437 --> 00:01:46,982
It's not just murder.

14
00:01:47,807 --> 00:01:48,923
Why...

15
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:55,023
Why did you do this without my permission?

16
00:01:57,057 --> 00:01:58,563
We have rules, you know.

17
00:02:27,218 --> 00:02:28,592
You've done well so far.

18
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,633
Honey.

19
00:02:35,158 --> 00:02:36,462
Are you the new guy?

20
00:02:37,498 --> 00:02:38,603
Yes.

21
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:45,043
The landlady told me about you. You moved into Unit 303.

22
00:02:45,397 --> 00:02:46,472
Yes.

23
00:02:48,637 --> 00:02:49,842
Isn't it nice up here?

24
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:55,152
The rooms are suffocating, just like a coffin.

25
00:02:55,748 --> 00:02:59,393
If you have a beer up here, you feel much better.

26
00:03:00,517 --> 00:03:01,622
You would.

27
00:03:11,028 --> 00:03:15,502
Why do you keep smiling at me?

28
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:19,742
Sorry if that was offensive.

29
00:03:20,137 --> 00:03:21,242
No.

30
00:03:22,237 --> 00:03:23,342
I just...

31
00:03:24,177 --> 00:03:26,212
- like it? - What?

32
00:03:30,848 --> 00:03:33,252
Do you want a beer? I just bought it. It's still cold.

33
00:03:42,327 --> 00:03:43,872
Did you hurt your hand?

34
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:48,842
Yes, at work.

35
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:51,273
Your work must be rough if you hurt your hand.

36
00:03:56,137 --> 00:03:58,652
You have very sensitive fingers.

37
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:01,923
Are you a writer?

38
00:04:03,948 --> 00:04:05,092
How do you know?

39
00:04:07,188 --> 00:04:11,733
Every person has their mood or feel.

40
00:04:13,617 --> 00:04:15,363
I do something similar.

41
00:04:17,727 --> 00:04:19,902
I dismantle, assemble,

42
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:21,573
and recreate.

43
00:04:22,227 --> 00:04:24,967
Who is he? He's being too friendly.

44
00:04:24,967 --> 00:04:26,342
What genre do you like?

45
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:29,313
I like...

46
00:04:30,207 --> 00:04:31,412
crime fiction.

47
00:04:35,077 --> 00:04:37,717
How fascinating. I like crime too.

48
00:04:37,717 --> 00:04:38,792
Do you?

49
00:04:39,548 --> 00:04:41,123
I like Raymond Chandler.

50
00:04:43,517 --> 00:04:45,387
Ray... Really?

51
00:04:45,387 --> 00:04:46,493
Yes.

52
00:04:47,827 --> 00:04:49,003
I like him too.

53
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:54,168
But... To be honest, I never thought...

54
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,298
I'd meet someone who likes him here.

55
00:04:56,298 --> 00:04:58,412
Not many people know Raymond Chandler.

56
00:04:58,668 --> 00:05:01,212
- Did you read "The High Window"? - Yes, of course I did.

57
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:04,352
Wow, that's so weird.

58
00:05:06,608 --> 00:05:08,222
- If you don't mind... - What?

59
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:11,092
Could you tell me what you're writing now?

60
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:12,722
- My story? - Yes.

61
00:05:12,948 --> 00:05:14,592
It's not finished yet.

62
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:16,847
Just tell me the plot.

63
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:18,292
- My story? - Yes.

64
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:21,162
I'm still working on it but...

65
00:05:22,787 --> 00:05:23,902
It's...

66
00:05:24,058 --> 00:05:29,172
It's about a pianist with a seemingly very promising future,

67
00:05:29,698 --> 00:05:32,612
but it turns out he's a serial killer on a rampage.

68
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:34,743
Weird, right?

69
00:05:34,967 --> 00:05:38,552
But there are such people around us.

70
00:05:39,378 --> 00:05:41,248
They look normal on the outside,

71
00:05:41,248 --> 00:05:43,852
- but inside, they want to kill. - Yes.

72
00:05:48,048 --> 00:05:49,387
How does he kill?

73
00:05:49,387 --> 00:05:50,493
What?

74
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,732
Your character, the pianist.

75
00:05:56,128 --> 00:05:59,073
He has his own method, his signature.

76
00:05:59,298 --> 00:06:02,003
On the night before a recital,

77
00:06:02,267 --> 00:06:05,972
with his bare hands, without using any tools,

78
00:06:06,068 --> 00:06:08,238
he strangles someone to death.

79
00:06:08,238 --> 00:06:11,112
Then he observes until they die.

80
00:06:13,137 --> 00:06:14,352
Continuously.

81
00:06:15,448 --> 00:06:18,878
The psychology behind what he does is,

82
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:22,688
with his two hands which are very pale and slender,

83
00:06:22,688 --> 00:06:27,058
he wants to feel the heat slowly leave the body.

84
00:06:27,058 --> 00:06:28,302
With his own hands.

85
00:06:28,887 --> 00:06:30,462
You've done well so far.

86
00:06:32,227 --> 00:06:33,472
Honey.

87
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:35,602
That's great.

88
00:06:37,298 --> 00:06:39,073
- Well. - It sounds great.

89
00:06:39,537 --> 00:06:42,083
I think I talked too much.

90
00:06:43,267 --> 00:06:44,412
But...

91
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:47,253
I don't think it's fading.

92
00:06:47,548 --> 00:06:49,282
What if it's burning up?

93
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:51,152
What?

94
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,792
So...

95
00:06:52,878 --> 00:06:55,922
when his hands strangle the victim,

96
00:06:56,387 --> 00:06:58,462
instead of the cold keys of a piano,

97
00:06:58,488 --> 00:07:02,662
maybe he feels the heat of a thousand degrees.

98
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:07,333
Don't you think that's what he wants to feel...

99
00:07:10,227 --> 00:07:12,542
Excuse me. You're the author.

100
00:07:12,597 --> 00:07:15,842
Not at all. I'm not an author yet.

101
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:19,953
You'll do very well.

102
00:07:21,748 --> 00:07:22,852
Cheers.

103
00:07:26,147 --> 00:07:27,422
What a relief.

104
00:07:27,587 --> 00:07:30,993
He seems to be the most normal one around here.

105
00:07:37,058 --> 00:07:38,058
Goodnight.

106
00:07:38,058 --> 00:07:39,602
- Bye. - Bye.

107
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:27,083
When his hands strangle the victim,

108
00:08:27,707 --> 00:08:29,652
instead of the cold keys of a piano,

109
00:08:29,748 --> 00:08:33,792
maybe he feels the heat of a thousand degrees.

110
00:08:34,018 --> 00:08:36,623
Don't you think that's what he wants to feel?

111
00:08:36,747 --> 00:08:40,062
I could add that to my novel.

112
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:54,213
I think I left my laptop open.

113
00:08:59,278 --> 00:09:01,123
It won't have closed on its own.

114
00:09:08,518 --> 00:09:09,918
(Die, die, die...)

115
00:09:09,918 --> 00:09:11,993
(I'm scared. I want to leave. I think he enters my room.)

116
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,227
Hey. Did you go into his room?

117
00:09:14,227 --> 00:09:15,802
Are you all teasing me?

118
00:09:15,827 --> 00:09:20,233
Why would I go in there when I have my own room?

119
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:24,743
Was that guy in my room too?

120
00:09:25,038 --> 00:09:27,298
No, let's not get too worked up.

121
00:09:27,337 --> 00:09:29,812
I might really end up going crazy like that guy.

122
00:09:52,428 --> 00:09:54,827
(Episode 3)

123
00:09:54,827 --> 00:10:00,983
(A Secret Whisper)

124
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:17,162
Why did he kill him?

125
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:19,192
I was going to do it.

126
00:10:21,827 --> 00:10:24,003
Now I'm upset.

127
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:26,032
You're not it.

128
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:28,672
Come and take the tarp!

129
00:10:33,668 --> 00:10:35,182
He's crazy.

130
00:10:51,888 --> 00:10:52,963
Come on.

131
00:10:53,788 --> 00:10:54,902
Darn it.

132
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:03,072
What are you doing? Hey.

133
00:11:07,237 --> 00:11:08,782
- What are you doing? - Playing with fire.

134
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:15,623
Why is it just me?

135
00:11:15,877 --> 00:11:18,853
Darn it. I'm dead tired.

136
00:11:19,117 --> 00:11:21,763
Hikers will start showing up soon. Get digging.

137
00:11:22,487 --> 00:11:23,623
Darn it.

138
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,957
It's so hot.

139
00:11:26,957 --> 00:11:28,302
(Somewhere in a mountain)

140
00:11:29,727 --> 00:11:31,633
It's so darn hot.

141
00:11:31,928 --> 00:11:33,702
So darn hot.

142
00:11:35,097 --> 00:11:36,973
Die. Die.

143
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:39,513
Die. Die.

144
00:11:39,898 --> 00:11:44,082
Die. Die. Die. Die.

145
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,412
Die.

146
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:55,993
I'm so hot.

147
00:11:58,518 --> 00:11:59,963
It's cooler now.

148
00:12:02,028 --> 00:12:04,133
It's hard to find places like this now.

149
00:12:04,528 --> 00:12:07,802
How many has it been now? Darn it.

150
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,243
Spray that thoroughly.

151
00:12:10,428 --> 00:12:13,213
Make sure to clean up anything that could be evidence.

152
00:12:13,538 --> 00:12:15,182
Get the license place too.

153
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,542
It's not like we killed him.

154
00:12:18,178 --> 00:12:20,812
Not the policeman.

155
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,853
That guy.

156
00:12:24,207 --> 00:12:26,123
We do all the cleaning up.

157
00:12:26,518 --> 00:12:28,062
Do you think I don't have insurance?

158
00:12:41,298 --> 00:12:43,273
Wake up, you idiot!

159
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:50,312
Your rank and name.

160
00:12:50,408 --> 00:12:51,607
Private Yun Jong Woo.

161
00:12:51,607 --> 00:12:53,713
What a small voice. You're so out of it.

162
00:12:55,077 --> 00:12:56,182
Did you fall asleep?

163
00:12:57,607 --> 00:12:58,692
No, sir.

164
00:12:58,977 --> 00:13:00,652
Now you're lying.

165
00:13:02,148 --> 00:13:03,292
Head down.

166
00:13:04,688 --> 00:13:05,792
I said head down.

167
00:13:10,928 --> 00:13:12,172
Close your eyes.

168
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:18,373
Close your eyes, I said.

169
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,513
If you want to sleep,

170
00:13:22,038 --> 00:13:23,912
sleep in that position.

171
00:14:00,877 --> 00:14:03,922
Why did I dream about being in the army?

172
00:14:08,117 --> 00:14:10,792
Even the shared toilet reminds me of the army.

173
00:14:20,757 --> 00:14:22,773
That guy's beyond help.

174
00:14:26,038 --> 00:14:30,143
Does he want to do that so early in the morning?

175
00:14:32,737 --> 00:14:36,082
He didn't check out my laptop, did he?

176
00:14:38,048 --> 00:14:40,393
I don't like this feeling.

177
00:15:03,138 --> 00:15:05,952
I don't see the guy who spat on me.

178
00:15:06,278 --> 00:15:07,952
I was hoping to complain.

179
00:15:09,548 --> 00:15:10,652
Hello.

180
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:17,192
Hello.

181
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:18,562
Did you sleep well?

182
00:15:18,688 --> 00:15:19,863
Yes.

183
00:15:20,688 --> 00:15:24,003
You seemed to have a nightmare. I heard something.

184
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:26,873
I did? I'm sorry.

185
00:15:28,298 --> 00:15:32,312
It's fine. You can even hear people breathing in other rooms.

186
00:15:32,837 --> 00:15:33,912
True.

187
00:15:33,938 --> 00:15:36,782
There are walls, but we pretty much live together.

188
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:40,113
By the way, have you seen the man next to my room?

189
00:15:42,948 --> 00:15:44,753
- Unit 302? - Yes.

190
00:15:48,818 --> 00:15:49,922
What about him?

191
00:15:50,087 --> 00:15:52,062
I haven't seen him since last night.

192
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:56,802
That reminds me. I haven't seen the thug either.

193
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,202
Isn't that strange?

194
00:16:00,957 --> 00:16:04,473
Even though we live together, we don't know each other.

195
00:16:04,938 --> 00:16:07,143
It seems it's a manner to ignore them.

196
00:16:07,908 --> 00:16:09,013
True.

197
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:13,682
No one wanted to live here on their will.

198
00:16:14,278 --> 00:16:16,422
How about some beer after work tonight?

199
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:22,162
I can't. I'm actually meeting my girlfriend tonight.

200
00:16:23,288 --> 00:16:25,562
- You have a girlfriend? - Yes.

201
00:16:25,757 --> 00:16:27,233
Right. Since you're so handsome.

202
00:16:28,528 --> 00:16:29,902
I'll get going first.

203
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:33,202
Let's have a beer some other time.

204
00:16:33,257 --> 00:16:35,302
Sure. No rush.

205
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:46,513
Oh, hello.

206
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:48,883
- Hello. - Hello.

207
00:16:57,788 --> 00:16:59,593
Let's not deal with them.

208
00:17:00,757 --> 00:17:02,233
Are you getting ready for work?

209
00:17:02,327 --> 00:17:04,703
You're very diligent for a young man.

210
00:17:04,997 --> 00:17:06,703
You didn't dry yourself well.

211
00:17:07,698 --> 00:17:08,903
You're like a baby.

212
00:17:09,797 --> 00:17:12,743
Come in. Have some breakfast. I'll make you a fried egg.

213
00:17:12,797 --> 00:17:14,072
I don't eat breakfast.

214
00:17:14,707 --> 00:17:15,782
What?

215
00:17:18,438 --> 00:17:20,882
- Ma'am. Ma'am. - Yes?

216
00:17:21,948 --> 00:17:23,023
What?

217
00:17:23,878 --> 00:17:27,017
The doors don't open without keys, right?

218
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:29,523
Of course they don't.

219
00:17:30,047 --> 00:17:32,892
- Did something go missing? - It's nothing.

220
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:35,503
And also,

221
00:17:39,098 --> 00:17:43,027
can you tell Unit 313...

222
00:17:43,027 --> 00:17:45,638
to keep his door closed?

223
00:17:45,698 --> 00:17:48,983
Why? I can't really tell him.

224
00:17:49,307 --> 00:17:51,338
I guess he finds the small room stifling.

225
00:17:51,338 --> 00:17:53,713
- He stinks so much. - He stinks?

226
00:17:54,078 --> 00:17:57,122
Also, he watches too much porn.

227
00:17:58,317 --> 00:18:00,052
- What's porn? - What?

228
00:18:00,977 --> 00:18:04,122
Okay, okay. I'll talk to him.

229
00:18:04,388 --> 00:18:05,693
- Thank you. - Yes.

230
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,763
You're cute. Have a good day at work.

231
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:15,503
Gosh.

232
00:18:43,328 --> 00:18:47,302
This will prove if someone was in my room.

233
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,342
Okay.

234
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,773
Take a picture of it.

235
00:19:30,967 --> 00:19:33,112
The door is locked too.

236
00:19:39,948 --> 00:19:41,663
What is wrong with this guy?

237
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:57,602
Let's just ignore him.

238
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:02,612
What's he holding behind him?

239
00:20:05,777 --> 00:20:07,112
Unit 313.

240
00:20:11,178 --> 00:20:13,023
Oh, have a good day at work.

241
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:14,193
Yes.

242
00:20:15,717 --> 00:20:16,822
Bye.

243
00:20:17,787 --> 00:20:20,263
If you're done getting the air out, close the door.

244
00:20:21,158 --> 00:20:22,733
I keep getting complaints.

245
00:20:24,128 --> 00:20:25,372
Close the door.

246
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:50,817
(Eden Studio)

247
00:20:50,817 --> 00:20:52,062
Did you take care of it?

248
00:20:53,388 --> 00:20:56,203
Yes, it's what I do.

249
00:21:00,628 --> 00:21:03,642
Take care of Unit 310 today too.

250
00:21:05,338 --> 00:21:06,542
Yes, I will.

251
00:21:09,237 --> 00:21:13,612
(Ji Eun. We're going to have dinner tonight, right?)

252
00:21:16,547 --> 00:21:19,052
(Yes, let's meet up tonight!)

253
00:21:33,698 --> 00:21:35,072
My.

254
00:21:37,168 --> 00:21:38,842
What are you doing here alone?

255
00:21:42,007 --> 00:21:43,243
Did you eat?

256
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:45,852
What about your mom?

257
00:21:47,638 --> 00:21:49,423
Where's your mom? Why are you alone?

258
00:21:50,878 --> 00:21:52,822
Did you eat? I guess you haven't.

259
00:21:57,217 --> 00:21:59,557
- Welcome. - Do you have cat food here?

260
00:21:59,557 --> 00:22:00,787
- Cat food? - Yes.

261
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:02,433
It's in the daily supplies section.

262
00:22:13,898 --> 00:22:15,082
What are you doing?

263
00:22:18,067 --> 00:22:20,207
Why do you keep feeding cats?

264
00:22:20,207 --> 00:22:21,453
Don't feed them.

265
00:22:22,648 --> 00:22:24,653
You're attracting cats.

266
00:22:24,777 --> 00:22:26,122
What are you doing?

267
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,322
It's too noisy to sleep at night.

268
00:22:57,608 --> 00:23:00,052
(Missing)

269
00:23:04,747 --> 00:23:06,892
(Missing)

270
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:27,913
Excuse me.

271
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,082
It's all right.

272
00:23:32,178 --> 00:23:33,292
Do you...

273
00:23:34,277 --> 00:23:35,923
happen to know Kumail?

274
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,292
Do you know my husband?

275
00:23:42,487 --> 00:23:44,032
When are you going to clean this up?

276
00:23:44,688 --> 00:23:45,773
Today?

277
00:23:45,828 --> 00:23:48,842
Mrs. Eom is actually complaining that it stinks.

278
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:51,973
Sir. Sir!

279
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:54,413
Get up. It will be over soon.

280
00:23:55,638 --> 00:23:58,453
- This is fun. - It's going to be over soon.

281
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:01,052
What's wrong with him? We didn't even anaesthetize him.

282
00:24:01,638 --> 00:24:02,753
Open your eyes.

283
00:24:03,777 --> 00:24:04,852
Let me see.

284
00:24:09,088 --> 00:24:10,763
I'll chop his neck.

285
00:24:11,588 --> 00:24:13,062
You guys clean up after.

286
00:24:14,557 --> 00:24:16,763
Promise me you'll give me his wrists.

287
00:24:17,487 --> 00:24:21,173
I can't wait to work on the new guy.

288
00:24:21,297 --> 00:24:24,372
He seems very soft.

289
00:24:25,368 --> 00:24:26,473
Be careful.

290
00:24:27,668 --> 00:24:29,142
Didn't you see Unit 302 dying?

291
00:24:30,007 --> 00:24:31,713
If anything goes wrong, you could all die too.

292
00:24:33,578 --> 00:24:37,322
My goodness. How scary.

293
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,253
Sir.

294
00:24:40,017 --> 00:24:41,648
Unit 302. The man you like...

295
00:24:41,648 --> 00:24:44,392
The man you were scared of. He's dead.

296
00:24:45,688 --> 00:24:46,763
Let me see.

297
00:24:47,688 --> 00:24:48,963
Halibut.

298
00:24:49,987 --> 00:24:51,632
Rockfish.

299
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:53,733
This is a blowfish.

300
00:24:55,727 --> 00:24:58,042
- Gosh. - It's about a span long.

301
00:25:01,485 --> 00:25:04,600
Yes, Ji Eun. I'm on my way to work.

302
00:25:06,225 --> 00:25:07,731
You must be very busy lately.

303
00:25:07,995 --> 00:25:11,941
Yes, we're launching four projects this month.

304
00:25:13,195 --> 00:25:15,681
I'm tired. What about you?

305
00:25:16,636 --> 00:25:19,681
Well... It's only been a day,

306
00:25:20,606 --> 00:25:22,520
but my predecessor is very prickly.

307
00:25:22,745 --> 00:25:24,981
He was very strict with me even on the first day.

308
00:25:25,215 --> 00:25:27,151
Still, try to get on with him.

309
00:25:27,846 --> 00:25:29,990
There's nothing good about going on the wrong side.

310
00:25:32,086 --> 00:25:33,786
If you're going to be on the phone, come out.

311
00:25:33,786 --> 00:25:35,661
Think about people in line.

312
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:37,260
Okay. I'll be out.

313
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,626
Sorry. I have to go. I'll call you later.

314
00:25:41,626 --> 00:25:45,070
Okay. Talk to you later. Bye.

315
00:25:59,376 --> 00:26:00,750
Boyfriend?

316
00:26:00,915 --> 00:26:02,090
Yes.

317
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,121
The writer?

318
00:26:06,056 --> 00:26:07,191
Yes.

319
00:26:07,856 --> 00:26:10,760
He hasn't debuted yet, has he?

320
00:26:11,185 --> 00:26:12,330
No.

321
00:26:12,856 --> 00:26:14,671
I bet it's not easy...

322
00:26:14,725 --> 00:26:18,401
especially when everyone's saying they're writers.

323
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,810
You probably know since you're in the field,

324
00:26:22,165 --> 00:26:23,280
don't you?

325
00:26:24,205 --> 00:26:25,310
Bye now.

326
00:26:29,475 --> 00:26:31,221
Ji Eun.

327
00:26:32,245 --> 00:26:33,350
Yes?

328
00:26:34,715 --> 00:26:37,560
Are you sure you checked for typos?

329
00:26:37,745 --> 00:26:39,356
I did.

330
00:26:39,356 --> 00:26:41,891
There are typos even though you checked?

331
00:26:43,455 --> 00:26:46,471
I only glanced at it and already found three.

332
00:26:47,195 --> 00:26:49,701
What if it was passed to the printing department already?

333
00:26:50,826 --> 00:26:53,540
It's about our pride. Don't you agree?

334
00:26:54,036 --> 00:26:56,111
I'm sorry. I'll go fix it.

335
00:26:56,765 --> 00:26:59,750
You know I'm a perfectionist.

336
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,550
I'm sensitive about that.

337
00:27:04,005 --> 00:27:07,651
You keep making basic mistakes.

338
00:27:09,215 --> 00:27:10,616
I'm sorry.

339
00:27:10,616 --> 00:27:11,691
Get back to work.

340
00:27:20,896 --> 00:27:25,265
(Project proposal)

341
00:27:25,265 --> 00:27:27,040
(What's the point of news if people aren't watching?)

342
00:27:36,046 --> 00:27:38,151
My husband doesn't answer his phone.

343
00:27:38,475 --> 00:27:40,990
My husband never does that.

344
00:27:41,215 --> 00:27:42,921
He called me every day.

345
00:27:48,455 --> 00:27:50,260
My husband lives here.

346
00:27:50,985 --> 00:27:54,495
Did you notice anything suspicious or different...

347
00:27:54,495 --> 00:27:57,401
the last time you talked to him?

348
00:27:58,965 --> 00:28:00,740
He said he was scared.

349
00:28:00,836 --> 00:28:02,040
Scared?

350
00:28:02,566 --> 00:28:03,566
(Eden Studio 3rd floor)

351
00:28:03,566 --> 00:28:04,941
Eden Studio...

352
00:28:06,975 --> 00:28:09,681
You didn't live together?

353
00:28:14,245 --> 00:28:17,861
The restaurant I work at is far away.

354
00:28:18,245 --> 00:28:20,191
Since we have to make money,

355
00:28:20,955 --> 00:28:22,800
we had to be separated.

356
00:28:24,086 --> 00:28:27,171
My husband said that place was scary.

357
00:28:30,025 --> 00:28:31,740
He said strange people...

358
00:28:32,366 --> 00:28:34,671
were trying to kill him.

359
00:28:35,366 --> 00:28:36,941
Kill him?

360
00:28:37,435 --> 00:28:39,310
It's all my fault.

361
00:28:42,175 --> 00:28:43,921
It's all my fault.

362
00:28:56,725 --> 00:28:58,131
You know what?

363
00:28:58,286 --> 00:29:01,000
Three things are missing in studios.

364
00:29:01,326 --> 00:29:04,040
There are no students, no sunlight,

365
00:29:04,366 --> 00:29:06,441
and no one who looks for us.

366
00:29:07,195 --> 00:29:10,510
But you made people...

367
00:29:10,866 --> 00:29:12,750
to look for us.

368
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:16,481
That's against the studio rules.

369
00:29:16,646 --> 00:29:18,381
You should've been careful.

370
00:29:21,846 --> 00:29:24,790
But it doesn't matter.

371
00:29:25,816 --> 00:29:28,830
The man who came to see you is dead.

00:29:30,025 --> 00:29:31,925
Zip all the way down.

373
00:29:31,925 --> 00:29:34,070
You make me say it all the time.

374
00:29:35,225 --> 00:29:36,600
You'll soon be dead too.

375
00:29:44,606 --> 00:29:46,211
But I...

376
00:29:46,475 --> 00:29:48,481
- Hello. - Oh, Jong Woo's here.

377
00:29:49,376 --> 00:29:51,376
He's our new intern.

378
00:29:51,376 --> 00:29:53,250
This is Reporter Jo Yu Cheol.

379
00:29:53,275 --> 00:29:55,616
- Nice to meet you... - Did you forget...

380
00:29:55,616 --> 00:29:57,790
to send me what I asked yesterday?

381
00:29:58,985 --> 00:30:00,760
I'm sorry. I forgot. I'm sorry.

382
00:30:02,556 --> 00:30:05,631
Still, you didn't forget to come to work.

383
00:30:07,225 --> 00:30:10,270
- Reporter Jo. You're here. - Oh, yes.

384
00:30:11,096 --> 00:30:13,495
CEO isn't coming until afternoon.

385
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:15,340
- What? - Hangover.

386
00:30:15,866 --> 00:30:17,306
Can you believe it? In this peak season?

387
00:30:17,306 --> 00:30:19,681
That's right. He drank a lot last night.

388
00:30:19,935 --> 00:30:23,820
It seems everyone's slacking off.

389
00:30:24,046 --> 00:30:26,750
You think the show promotion is easy?

390
00:30:28,346 --> 00:30:31,221
You're writing an article without even watching the play.

391
00:30:31,745 --> 00:30:34,330
What are you trying to say?

392
00:30:34,386 --> 00:30:36,300
- Nothing. - Goodness.

393
00:30:36,386 --> 00:30:39,100
You're scaring me. I should leave.

394
00:30:39,356 --> 00:30:40,755
I'll come back later to meet the CEO.

395
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,840
- Yes, bye. - Bye.

396
00:30:44,566 --> 00:30:45,671
Seriously.

397
00:30:45,765 --> 00:30:48,411
Good work by yourself.

398
00:30:48,566 --> 00:30:49,740
Is he a pervert?

399
00:30:49,866 --> 00:30:53,111
He made so much fuss in the morning. I hate him.

400
00:30:54,235 --> 00:30:56,106
- Mr. Intern. - Yes?

401
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:57,275
What's your name?

402
00:30:57,275 --> 00:30:58,646
- It's Yun Jong Woo. - Right. Jong Woo.

403
00:30:58,646 --> 00:30:59,891
Come here for a second.

404
00:31:00,445 --> 00:31:04,090
We're so busy. You need to get to work right away.

405
00:31:04,485 --> 00:31:05,830
Do you know how to make powerpoint?

406
00:31:05,985 --> 00:31:08,086
- I learned... - Just look at the manual...

407
00:31:08,086 --> 00:31:10,830
in the back and organize it.

408
00:31:10,955 --> 00:31:13,030
If you're stuck, ask General Manager Park.

409
00:31:13,495 --> 00:31:14,770
Okay.

410
00:31:17,265 --> 00:31:18,701
Let's see.

411
00:31:28,675 --> 00:31:33,121
Say don't kill me.

412
00:31:40,915 --> 00:31:42,760
Let me see.

413
00:31:44,856 --> 00:31:47,096
Please stop.

414
00:31:47,156 --> 00:31:48,731
I won.

415
00:31:48,796 --> 00:31:50,701
Give me your wrist.

416
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,505
He didn't say don't kill me.

417
00:31:57,505 --> 00:31:59,376
My turn.

418
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:02,205
It's my turn now. Wait.

419
00:32:02,205 --> 00:32:05,921
- What are you doing? - I made a bet too.

420
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,745
You said what.

421
00:32:07,745 --> 00:32:09,015
You heard him too, right?

422
00:32:09,015 --> 00:32:10,590
- You liar. - Gosh.

423
00:32:12,856 --> 00:32:14,030
Gosh.

424
00:32:17,725 --> 00:32:19,471
I'm usually good,

425
00:32:19,556 --> 00:32:21,901
but it's going to hurt because you're not under anaesthesia.

426
00:32:23,925 --> 00:32:25,840
What can you do? You have no choice but to bear.

427
00:32:29,136 --> 00:32:30,810
All right. All right.

428
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:34,651
It'll be over soon.

It's not 13.

432
00:32:48,556 --> 00:32:49,731
What?

433
00:32:49,955 --> 00:32:53,600
- Jung Hwa. - Only one.

435
00:33:13,545 --> 00:33:16,091
I have absolutely no idea what to do.

436
00:33:22,755 --> 00:33:26,370
Mr. Park. I'm sorry, but can you take a look at this?

437
00:33:26,855 --> 00:33:28,870
So I...

438
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,040
What?

439
00:33:30,395 --> 00:33:32,140
You can't even do something that simple?

440
00:33:32,565 --> 00:33:34,111
How did you even graduate?

441
00:33:35,936 --> 00:33:39,281
If you got in through connection, you need to work hard.

442
00:33:40,436 --> 00:33:43,850
What have you done since you got to work today? Wasting time?

443
00:33:45,445 --> 00:33:48,591
Did you go straight to sleep after work yesterday?

444
00:33:50,346 --> 00:33:52,761
Did you go over your work?

445
00:33:52,956 --> 00:33:54,060
I'm sorry.

How does this work?

449
00:34:16,246 --> 00:34:19,220
I really hate to ask him.

450
00:34:29,085 --> 00:34:31,125
What is it? Are you stuck?

451
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:32,231
Sorry?

452
00:34:32,726 --> 00:34:34,770
Yes, I don't understand this part.

453
00:34:35,766 --> 00:34:38,801
You just need to press control and Z.

454
00:34:39,096 --> 00:34:40,211
Easy, right?

455
00:34:42,195 --> 00:34:43,310
Right.

456
00:34:43,465 --> 00:34:46,051
Feel free to ask him any questions.

457
00:34:46,206 --> 00:34:48,051
Don't stress over it by yourself.

458
00:34:50,206 --> 00:34:51,321
How cute.

459
00:35:13,965 --> 00:35:16,040
He's such a loser.

460
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,011
He's exactly the same as that pervert I live next door to.

461
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,481
Excuse me.

462
00:35:22,105 --> 00:35:23,846
- Are you feeling okay? - Reporter Jo left, right?

463
00:35:23,846 --> 00:35:26,390
Yes, he did. You came late on purpose, right?

464
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:30,290
- Have some tteokbokki. - What's the occasion?

465
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:32,585
You're having this after drinking yesterday? Are you all right?

466
00:35:32,585 --> 00:35:35,660
- Come on. What did Reporter Jo say? - He looked for you.

467
00:35:35,786 --> 00:35:37,901
What do you think? He was a total nuisance.

468
00:35:38,186 --> 00:35:40,131
- Good work. - This looks good.

469
00:35:40,525 --> 00:35:41,600
Let's eat.

470
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,401

472
00:38:03,105 --> 00:38:04,981
I'm sure he'll nag again.

473
00:38:06,605 --> 00:38:09,450
Sir, I'm sorry, but could you take a look at this?

474
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:18,461
You just need to apply what I had told you before.

475
00:38:19,145 --> 00:38:20,591
Do you not understand?

476
00:38:21,815 --> 00:38:26,156
Gosh, use your brain, will you?

477
00:38:26,156 --> 00:38:27,731
Don't be so thoughtless.

478
00:38:28,456 --> 00:38:31,200
An elementary school kid would do much better.

479
00:38:32,525 --> 00:38:35,910
Why do these numbers look like this?

480
00:38:36,536 --> 00:38:38,941
Did you not set a formula?

481
00:38:39,636 --> 00:38:41,680
Gosh, you don't know the basics.

482
00:38:42,105 --> 00:38:44,180
When the prices change,

483
00:38:44,246 --> 00:38:46,491
you'll have to change them all manually.

484
00:38:46,675 --> 00:38:49,321
You just need Vlookup function for this.

485
00:38:49,585 --> 00:38:53,160
You could easily search for this online.

486
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:03,200
Just shut it.

487
00:39:06,036 --> 00:39:08,666
What is it? Can you not hear me?

488
00:39:08,666 --> 00:39:09,741
Sorry?

489
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:11,981
Focus, will you?

490
00:39:13,076 --> 00:39:14,750
The problem isn't that you don't know how to do it.

491
00:39:15,136 --> 00:39:17,151
You lack the motivation to learn.

492
00:39:18,246 --> 00:39:21,191
All right. Let's call it a day.

493
00:39:21,815 --> 00:39:22,921
- All right. - Okay.

494
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,301
- Are you going home? - Sorry?

495
00:39:38,625 --> 00:39:42,981
If I were you, I would stay behind and learn a bit more.

496
00:39:43,965 --> 00:39:47,410
Let's be frank here. You should earn your keep.

497
00:39:51,275 --> 00:39:52,450
See you tomorrow.

about your nephew, Byun Deuk Jong.

Could you answer some questions?

512
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:42,560
Those kids were strange ever since they were born.

513
00:41:42,956 --> 00:41:44,031
Strange?

514
00:41:45,485 --> 00:41:47,000
The others said...

515
00:41:47,395 --> 00:41:50,241
I must've been too drunk and misunderstood everything.

516
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,640
I'm pretty sure...

517
00:41:53,596 --> 00:41:54,810
that...

518
00:41:55,965 --> 00:41:58,741
they started the fire to kill me.

519
00:42:01,235 --> 00:42:03,680
But they were just kids.

520
00:42:03,976 --> 00:42:06,976
Do you think I'm lying? Do you think I'm drunk?

521
00:42:07,016 --> 00:42:08,120
- I'm sorry, sir. - Do you?

522
00:42:08,516 --> 00:42:12,020
No one else but me knows about this.

523
00:42:13,156 --> 00:42:17,056
Sir, do you have any photos...

524
00:42:17,056 --> 00:42:18,930
or belongings of theirs?

525
00:42:26,636 --> 00:42:27,741

00:43:31,195 --> 00:43:32,540
What is this?

529
00:43:51,085 --> 00:43:52,591
- Move aside. - Okay.

530
00:44:07,766 --> 00:44:08,870
After I had sent them...

531
00:44:09,706 --> 00:44:11,140
to the orphanage,

532
00:44:12,565 --> 00:44:14,580
they sent me this after a long while.

533
00:44:15,706 --> 00:44:18,045
Could I take a closer look at this...

534
00:44:18,045 --> 00:44:19,645
and bring them back later?

535
00:44:19,645 --> 00:44:21,250
Suit yourself. You can throw them away.

536
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,821
I don't want to see them anyway.

Oh, my. You rascals.

544
00:45:49,596 --> 00:45:50,981
You caught so many.

545
00:45:52,306 --> 00:45:55,151
We'll be able to have frog legs tonight.

00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:47,542
It'd be too late to ask her to meet, right?

552
00:46:48,867 --> 00:46:50,812
Are you still working when you've worked overtime?

553
00:46:52,777 --> 00:46:54,852
Yes, we have a meeting tomorrow.

554
00:46:55,376 --> 00:46:57,192
You're a workaholic.

555
00:46:59,146 --> 00:47:00,522
Don't pick a fight with me.

556
00:47:04,317 --> 00:47:07,261
(Jong Woo)

557
00:47:09,357 --> 00:47:11,432
- The number you have called... - She must be busy.

558
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:12,631
cannot be reached.

559
00:47:22,166 --> 00:47:24,312
I wonder if the kitten is back.

560
00:47:24,777 --> 00:47:26,281
It must be hungry.

561
00:47:32,926 --> 00:47:34,342
Hello.

562
00:47:43,546 --> 00:47:45,906
- Heave-ho. - Be careful.

563
00:47:45,906 --> 00:47:47,351
Heave-ho.

564
00:47:47,446 --> 00:47:49,592
- Heave-ho. Oh, no. - Be careful.

565
00:47:51,116 --> 00:47:52,886
Wrap it up well, okay?

566
00:47:52,886 --> 00:47:54,616
I'm so excited.

567
00:47:54,616 --> 00:47:56,457
Be quiet. You'll wake up everyone.

568
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:57,601
Don't fool around.

569
00:47:57,727 --> 00:47:59,831
Don't you worry.

570
00:48:00,557 --> 00:48:01,932
Carry the front.

571
00:48:02,127 --> 00:48:04,296
No, you carry the front.

572
00:48:04,296 --> 00:48:05,926
I said, carry the front.

573
00:48:05,997 --> 00:48:07,437
No, you carry the front.

574
00:48:07,437 --> 00:48:09,472
Carry the front. You're younger.

575
00:48:13,037 --> 00:48:15,311
- Should I? - Go on.

576
00:48:15,587 --> 00:48:19,471
- Let's go. - Let's go.

577
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:22,171
Heave-ho, heave-ho.

578
00:48:22,197 --> 00:48:24,542
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

579
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:28,312
Heave-ho. Hold on.

580
00:48:52,797 --> 00:48:59,496
- Heave-ho, heave-ho. - Heave-ho, heave-ho.

581
00:48:59,496 --> 00:49:00,706
It's the twins.

582
00:49:00,766 --> 00:49:03,036
- Heave-ho, heave-ho. - Heave-ho, heave-ho.

583
00:49:03,036 --> 00:49:05,281
- What are they doing at this hour? - Heave-ho.

584
00:49:05,607 --> 00:49:10,146
- Heave-ho, heave-ho. - Heave-ho, heave-ho.

585
00:49:10,146 --> 00:49:12,051
What's in that sack?

586
00:49:12,076 --> 00:49:15,292
- Heave-ho, heave-ho. - Heave-ho, heave-ho.

587
00:49:16,317 --> 00:49:18,392
I want to be at the front.

588
00:49:39,036 --> 00:49:41,381
Heave-ho.

589
00:49:42,047 --> 00:49:43,151
Heave-ho.

590
00:50:25,516 --> 00:50:26,662
Hi.

591
00:50:27,326 --> 00:50:28,432
Kitty.

592
00:50:28,956 --> 00:50:31,772
You're so pretty. Come here.

593
00:50:34,867 --> 00:50:36,372
What are you doing?

594
00:50:37,867 --> 00:50:42,036
I went to the police station because of you.

595
00:50:42,036 --> 00:50:44,651
You idiot! You shouldn't have gotten caught then.

596
00:50:44,706 --> 00:50:47,881
I only killed one.

597
00:50:48,076 --> 00:50:50,221
I'm upset.

598
00:50:53,177 --> 00:50:55,617
Die. Die.

599
00:50:55,617 --> 00:50:57,157
You scumbag.

600
00:50:57,157 --> 00:50:59,091
Let's move it.

601
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:05,701
Die! Hey!

602
00:51:24,677 --> 00:51:25,951
Die!

603
00:51:35,956 --> 00:51:37,071
What are you watching?

604
00:51:38,427 --> 00:51:39,531
What?

605
00:51:42,467 --> 00:51:44,011
It's the twins.

606
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:48,142
I saw them on my way home.

607
00:51:51,036 --> 00:51:52,151
Guys.

608
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,051
You scumbag.

609
00:52:00,887 --> 00:52:02,662
Hello.

610
00:52:04,686 --> 00:52:06,031
What are you doing here?

611
00:52:07,487 --> 00:52:10,757
The lady asked us...

612
00:52:10,757 --> 00:52:12,971
to throw away the garbage.

613
00:52:13,427 --> 00:52:15,467
In exchange for living here for free,

614
00:52:15,467 --> 00:52:17,912
we help her out with house chores.

615
00:52:19,967 --> 00:52:22,381
I thought you were getting rid of a body or something.

616
00:52:23,166 --> 00:52:24,281
Right?

617
00:52:24,476 --> 00:52:25,611
What?

618
00:52:31,677 --> 00:52:32,752
Well...

619
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:34,792
I...

620
00:52:35,786 --> 00:52:37,491
Why are you throwing the garbage here?

621
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:47,542
The lady asked us to throw it away where there were no cameras.

622
00:52:50,137 --> 00:52:53,781
By the way, what's that black spot?

623
00:52:54,607 --> 00:52:56,741
It looks like blood.

624
00:52:58,576 --> 00:53:00,352
This is...

625
00:53:00,407 --> 00:53:04,951
food waste.

626
00:53:05,516 --> 00:53:08,892
The dirty water leaked.

627
00:53:10,956 --> 00:53:14,162
Do you not separate regular waste from food waste?

628
00:53:15,157 --> 00:53:17,002
That's not right.

629
00:53:18,226 --> 00:53:19,301
Right?

630
00:53:19,527 --> 00:53:21,241
Well... I...

631
00:53:22,396 --> 00:53:24,971
- I'll tell the landlady that... - Let's open it.

632
00:53:25,867 --> 00:53:27,042
Why don't we just open it?

633
00:53:28,337 --> 00:53:31,212
Why don't we open the bag and see if there's nothing sketchy inside?

634
00:53:42,346 --> 00:53:43,892
Unit 303 is right.

635
00:53:45,016 --> 00:53:46,091
Open it.

636
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:48,962
Open the bag already.

637
00:53:49,587 --> 00:53:51,301
I'll report to the police otherwise.

638
00:54:07,607 --> 00:54:09,721
You can open it yourself if you're so curious.

639
00:54:43,817 --> 00:54:44,921
Hey,

640
00:54:45,717 --> 00:54:48,062
you can't discard a dead cat here.

641
00:54:48,947 --> 00:54:54,602
It died after eating too much rat poison.

642
00:55:01,896 --> 00:55:03,042
Are you okay?

643
00:55:05,637 --> 00:55:07,142
My legs are shaking.

644
00:55:08,266 --> 00:55:09,412
Wait for me.

645
00:55:10,976 --> 00:55:15,151
Goodnight.

646
00:55:23,547 --> 00:55:24,692
That scared you, didn't it?

647
00:55:24,916 --> 00:55:27,462
No, I'm fine.

648
00:55:27,587 --> 00:55:29,732
How is he so calm?

649
00:55:32,797 --> 00:55:34,502
My dad is a veterinarian.

650
00:55:34,697 --> 00:55:36,297
I'm used to seeing animal corpses.

651
00:55:36,297 --> 00:55:37,412
What?

652
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:40,682
Can he read my mind or something?

653
00:55:41,507 --> 00:55:44,551
I guess your date with your girlfriend got cancelled?

654
00:55:44,976 --> 00:55:46,051
Yes.

655
00:55:46,637 --> 00:55:48,821
Then would you like to grab a beer with me?

656
00:55:52,117 --> 00:55:54,421
It gets lonely when you're alone in your room after work.

657
00:55:55,346 --> 00:55:56,662
Don't you feel that way?

658
00:56:03,487 --> 00:56:04,571
Hold on.

659
00:56:18,607 --> 00:56:20,881
Try this. It's delicious.

660
00:56:21,177 --> 00:56:22,281
Okay.

661
00:56:28,117 --> 00:56:31,062
The landlady made this. Try it.

662
00:56:31,857 --> 00:56:32,962
Okay.

663
00:56:47,867 --> 00:56:49,682
I don't know if it's because I just saw a dead cat,

664
00:56:50,576 --> 00:56:51,752
but it tastes weird.

665
00:56:53,237 --> 00:56:54,921
I guess it's not your cup of tea.

666
00:56:55,846 --> 00:56:59,051
Well... It's not.

667
00:57:02,246 --> 00:57:04,361
I guess you're not into this part.

668
00:57:06,117 --> 00:57:08,602
- What? - I have other parts. You want some?

669
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:12,372
It's late. Why don't we just drink and go in?

670
00:57:23,706 --> 00:57:26,412
That's weird. It's some good meat.

671
00:57:47,067 --> 00:57:48,272
Why are you so startled?

672
00:57:49,996 --> 00:57:52,071
You think this is human meat or something?

673
00:58:33,436 --> 00:58:35,982
(Stranger from Hell)

674
00:58:36,047 --> 00:58:38,476
People here are weird.

675
00:58:38,476 --> 00:58:40,346
I don't know who it is,

676
00:58:40,346 --> 00:58:41,717
but I think someone has been breaking into my room.

677
00:58:41,717 --> 00:58:43,246
You know that this person is missing, right?

678
00:58:43,317 --> 00:58:45,817
Of course, I was the one who reported him missing.

679
00:58:45,817 --> 00:58:47,401
Look at the back.

680
00:58:48,726 --> 00:58:50,462
We're going to check the back of your car.

681
00:58:50,596 --> 00:58:52,301
How's the man in Unit 303?

682
00:58:52,427 --> 00:58:55,102
Smile. I said smile.

683
00:58:55,927 --> 00:58:58,436
- Hello. - He's scary.

684
00:58:58,436 --> 00:59:01,567
Was there anybody else that was reported missing?

685
00:59:01,567 --> 00:59:03,881
Why? Are you suspecting anyone?
