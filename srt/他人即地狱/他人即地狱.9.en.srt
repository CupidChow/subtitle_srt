1
00:00:17,113 --> 00:00:20,014
(All places, names, organizations, groups...)

2
00:00:20,014 --> 00:00:22,958
(and religions in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:54,599 --> 00:00:55,945
Unit 310?

4
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,305
You need to move out.

5
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:13,404
How many bags is that man going to take up?

6
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,594
It's time to get to work.

7
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:13,104
Jong Woo.

8
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,154
Ji Eun!

9
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,694
Ji Eun, Ji Eun!

10
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,124
Ji Eun, Ji Eun!

11
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,519
Ji Eun, Ji Eun!

12
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,119
I can explain. Ji Eun!

13
00:02:43,119 --> 00:02:44,730
- Let me go! - I'm sorry.

14
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:48,359
- I'm so sorry. I can explain. - Let me go.

15
00:02:48,359 --> 00:02:51,004
Please hear me out.

16
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,974
I can explain everything.

17
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:57,175
- Just give me a moment. - Explain what?

18
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,215
About that studio again?

19
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,624
When you were starting to turn weird,

20
00:03:07,619 --> 00:03:09,555
I thought it was just because you hadn't gotten used to Seoul yet.

21
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,250
I've been waiting for you to be back to your normal self.

22
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,690
I thought it'd be fine if I waited,

23
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,835
but what is this?

24
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:20,835
Ji Eun.

25
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:23,874
Look at me.

26
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,715
Let's...

27
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,145
take a break.

28
00:03:42,279 --> 00:03:46,995
(Episode 9. Cognitive Dissonance)

29
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,404
It only has a week's worth of footage.

30
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,104
There's no footage of the car driving out.

31
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,424
Hello.

32
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,719
I have a question.

33
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:25,534
Do you know this area well?

34
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:27,829
I know this place like the back of my hand.

35
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:28,829
I see.

36
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:33,329
Have you seen an abandoned car around here then?

37
00:04:33,329 --> 00:04:34,515
- A car? - Yes.

38
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,145
I don't think I have.

39
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:39,940
I see.

40
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,715
Why do you ask?

41
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,354
Sorry,

42
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,924
I'm Soh Jung Hwa from Eunhye Patrol Division.

43
00:04:48,779 --> 00:04:50,125
- You're the police? - Yes, I am.

44
00:04:51,089 --> 00:04:53,250
I have another question.

45
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,335
Then...

46
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:57,729
do you know of a remote place...

47
00:04:57,729 --> 00:04:59,435
where a car may be hidden?

48
00:05:00,459 --> 00:05:03,705
When you drive up there,

49
00:05:04,229 --> 00:05:06,375
there's an area that's remote and a little creepy.

50
00:05:06,599 --> 00:05:09,339
I don't think a woman should go alone there.

51
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:11,110
How can I get there?

52
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,640
Do I just drive straight?

53
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,654
Drive up around 500m and you'll reach a field.

54
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,094
There's a path that doesn't seem like you can drive down.

55
00:05:22,349 --> 00:05:26,065
Walk in there and you'll find the place.

56
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,695
That's just liquid coming out of food waste.

57
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,614
Found it.

58
00:06:56,579 --> 00:06:57,784
Let me make a phone call.

59
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,494
(Jo Hyun Ho)

60
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:11,190
- Hello? - Hyun Ho.

61
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,329
- Yes? - Can you look up a car ID number?

62
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:15,304
- A car ID number? - Yes.

63
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:20,844
KNAJC5213.

64
00:07:35,149 --> 00:07:36,149
(Seok Yun)

65
00:07:36,149 --> 00:07:38,419
(Jong Woo, I'm drinking with the guy in Unit 304 right now.)

66
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:40,724
(He's not as bad as I thought.)

67
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:49,674
(Hey, are you crazy?)

68
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,404
Something is off.

69
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,075
(Seok Yun)

70
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:04,385
The number you've dialed is unavailable right now...

71
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,195
Seok Yun isn't the one who sent the message.

72
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,655
To the intersection in Eunhye-dong, please.

73
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,994
(Are you all right?)

74
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:50,335
(Pick up your phone!)

75
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:55,899
- You found this here? - Yes.

76
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:58,045
- Make sure to check it properly. - Okay.

77
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,974
I'm sorry,

78
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:02,640
but can you be somewhere else?

79
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,085
- Sorry. - Okay.

80
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,624
Hey.

81
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:13,610
Are you Ms. Soh Jung Hwa?

82
00:09:13,610 --> 00:09:15,195
Yes.

83
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,989
I'm Detective Lee Kwang Jae.

84
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,894
Hello.

85
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,659
It's great that you're doing your job as the police,

86
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:28,029
but there's a proper process in investigations.

87
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:30,029
- Right. - Don't you know what happens...

88
00:09:30,029 --> 00:09:31,399
when you ignore that?

89
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:32,799
I'm sorry,

90
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:35,199
but I told you over the phone...

91
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:39,509
that Detective Cha might have been murdered or abducted.

92
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,480
I told you about the syringe needle that I found.

93
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,880
- The syringe needle? - Yes.

94
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:46,655
Have you found anything else? Any suspects?

95
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,055
For now,

96
00:09:49,179 --> 00:09:51,289
my dentist seems suspicious.

97
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:52,390
- Your dentist? - That's...

98
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,559
Are you trying to say that a dentist...

99
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:56,159
murdered someone with a syringe?

100
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:58,929
That's not what I meant. I sent you the needle...

101
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:01,405
- so that you can get it checked. - Hold on.

102
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,734
Hold on.

103
00:10:03,529 --> 00:10:05,398
- Ms. Soh. - Yes.

104
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:09,199
Do you know exactly where Detective Cha drove up to...

105
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:10,469
and exactly where the car is parked?

106
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:12,809
That's what I want to ask you to do.

107
00:10:12,809 --> 00:10:14,010
- You're asking me to do that - You can check...

108
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:17,010
solely based on the syringe needle that you found.

109
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:20,510
Don't you think you're going overboard with such little evidence?

110
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,380
You can pick up syringe needles anywhere and everywhere.

111
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:24,325
I need to speak to you for a moment.

112
00:10:24,549 --> 00:10:25,864
Go ahead.

113
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:28,295
A body has been found...

114
00:10:34,289 --> 00:10:36,435
- Follow me. - Okay.

115
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,769
- Goodness. - Detective.

116
00:10:38,769 --> 00:10:41,445
Can you tell me what's going on?

117
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:44,809
A corpse has been found in Omok-dong...

118
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:45,809
A corpse?

119
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:47,644
and it has a mark of syringe needles on the neck.

120
00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:18,884
I'll just go in and get Seok Yun out of the place.

121
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,384
I can't leave him alone here because it's too dangerous.

122
00:11:28,419 --> 00:11:30,055
(Maum Church)

123
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,665
Hey!

124
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,659
Can you tell the guys upstairs to walk quietly?

125
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:40,705
Why do people there walk like they're stomping?

126
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,330
I can't focus on my prayer.

127
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,104
What's that? Oh no...

128
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,675
My goodness.

129
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,774
Seok Yun.

130
00:12:59,309 --> 00:13:00,484
Seok Yun!

131
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,155
Jong Woo.

132
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:09,179
Did I scare you?

133
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:11,825
I thought it'd be funny to pull a prank on you.

134
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:14,124
- Funny? - Yes.

135
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,035
You idiot.

136
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,305
You think this is funny?

137
00:13:21,699 --> 00:13:23,360
You think this whole thing is funny?

138
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,974
- I'm sorry. - Tell me.

139
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:28,000
You really think this is the time for you to joke around?

140
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,844
I'm sorry.

141
00:13:31,199 --> 00:13:34,609
Are you one of these guys?

142
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,580
What do you mean, one of them? I'm on your side.

143
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,785
What do you think?

144
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:40,524
Don't you think you feel the warmth from your hands?

145
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:45,465
Calm down.

146
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:52,090
That moment, I thought,

147
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,830
"What if he's one of them?"

148
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:55,675
Hold on, Jong Woo.

149
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,075
Calm down. Let's stay together here.

150
00:14:00,269 --> 00:14:01,974
You know I like you.

151
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:05,484
You idiot. Get out of here.

152
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,055
I can't.

153
00:14:08,679 --> 00:14:10,085
You're insane.

154
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:12,585
You're just like them.

155
00:14:12,649 --> 00:14:13,724
You know that?

156
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:18,295
Jong Woo, I've been...

157
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,789
I've been thinking,

158
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:22,559
I don't think we need to be so scared of the guys here.

159
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:24,189
- What? - I've been talking to them...

160
00:14:24,189 --> 00:14:26,634
and I've realized that they're all good people.

161
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:29,134
- Let me go. - So you should...

162
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:32,000
also open up a little bit and live with us.

163
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,474
- You're insane. - Let's live here together.

164
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:40,085
You can't judge a book by its cover.

165
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,980
Jong Woo, do you want to come and watch me perform?

166
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,808
Please!

167
00:14:45,809 --> 00:14:48,455
Do you want to come and watch me perform?

168
00:14:50,549 --> 00:14:51,695
Please.

169
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,894
Please.

170
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:58,705
Please stay with me.

171
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:06,769
See?

172
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:09,899
You think you're close, but you're all strangers in the end.

173
00:15:09,899 --> 00:15:11,014
I...

174
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:15,439
tried my best.

175
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:17,354
You heard it all.

176
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:20,085
- So please... - I know.

177
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,655
I know you tried your best.

178
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,864
But you failed,

179
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,035
so here comes the punishment.

180
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:33,734
Oh my goodness.

181
00:15:34,289 --> 00:15:36,374
I thought you'd be dead by now.

182
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:43,144
The lady really went a little too far, didn't she?

183
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,445
Do you want me to save your life?

184
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,524
Just wait.

185
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,825
I'm going to slice you up...

186
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,965
along with everyone else here.

187
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:07,205
But for today,

188
00:16:09,929 --> 00:16:13,104
let me have a little taste of blood.

189
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,024
Darn it!

190
00:16:27,909 --> 00:16:29,724
Darn.

191
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,234
Darn.

192
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:42,474
Right.

193
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,805
This makes things more fun.

194
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,774
You want to have some fun?

195
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:50,474
You want to?

196
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,955
What is he calling about again?

197
00:17:01,549 --> 00:17:02,955
Take a break.

198
00:17:11,689 --> 00:17:14,659
Yes, Mr. Park. What's up?

199
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,100
Where are you right now?

200
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,145
Where? Home, obviously.

201
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,574
Those monsters.

202
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,014
I'm never coming back here again.

203
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,415
Monsters.

204
00:17:30,439 --> 00:17:33,280
The electronic anklet bracelet seems to be running out of battery.

205
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,610
Make sure you go to your room and charge it now.

206
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,550
If you don't within 10 minutes, the police will come to you.

207
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,125
I'm going to have to charge it then.

208
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:40,294
All right.

209
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:45,504
I should leave this place as soon as possible.

210
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:46,865
Where are you going?

211
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:51,804
Ms. Eom. Do you speak Mandarin?

212
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,474
Oh, did I not tell you?

213
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,715
My ex-husband... No.

214
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,314
My ex-ex-husband was a Korean expat.

215
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:06,855
You got so lucky with men.

216
00:18:08,749 --> 00:18:10,395
How do you like me?

217
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,264
Come to my room if you feel lonely at night.

218
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,994
When I ran an orphanage,

219
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,064
I was really good at picking out the kids that were lying.

220
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,445
Those kids had this look in their eyes.

221
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,445
Like you now.

222
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,615
Shall I tell you how my ex-husband died?

223
00:18:33,939 --> 00:18:35,584
He was blind.

224
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:38,355
But he slipped and fell down the stairs.

225
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,754
She's crazy.

226
00:18:45,189 --> 00:18:46,564
Watch the stairs.

227
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,135
So the surveillance cameras were down?

228
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,935
It caught nothing but a mess.

229
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,429
- This? - Yes.

230
00:18:58,429 --> 00:18:59,605
What about the syringe?

231
00:19:00,229 --> 00:19:02,570
There was a needle mark on his neck.

232
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:05,469
- Did you find the syringe? - No, it wasn't here.

233
00:19:05,469 --> 00:19:07,484
- The assailant... - Wait. Excuse me.

234
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,810
Once the National Forensic Service carries out the autopsy,

235
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:12,310
we'll find out what drug...

236
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,125
was in the victim's system.

237
00:19:14,249 --> 00:19:15,880
You know the syringe you found?

238
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:17,780
If they confirm it's the same drug,

239
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,590
I'll visit the studio then...

240
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:20,689
- and check... - But...

241
00:19:20,689 --> 00:19:22,790
I told you about the studio last time.

242
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,219
Yes, and I'll check.

243
00:19:24,219 --> 00:19:27,759
It could be too late. They might be killing someone else.

244
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:30,175
Will you... Look, Ms. Soh.

245
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,635
- Yes? - Do you see me working?

246
00:19:31,899 --> 00:19:33,974
We're doing the best we can.

247
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,974
Go back to your division and wait.

248
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,239
- Let's go. - Now go.

249
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:38,445
Let's go.

250
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:44,115
Save me.

251
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,455
You wanted to know...

252
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,554
what had been happening on the 4th floor.

253
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,880
Save me.

254
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,465
What happened to the guy who lived in your room.

255
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,304
They're all here.

256
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:05,645
Save me...

257
00:20:10,469 --> 00:20:12,945
I got it, I got it.

258
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,554
It's time to eat.

259
00:20:19,479 --> 00:20:20,554
What's this?

260
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:25,665
Who dared to leave a mark on my property?

261
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,264
Where are you going?

262
00:20:29,719 --> 00:20:32,905
Ms. Eom. Do you speak Mandarin?

263
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:12,504
Let's wear my new shoes and jump up high

264
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:20,784
My brother is the best.

265
00:21:26,749 --> 00:21:28,084
No, no.

266
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,294
I was just passing through. I was passing through.

267
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,665
What's your problem?

268
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,395
Are you sure?

269
00:21:38,489 --> 00:21:42,574
If you leave now, you'll miss an exclusive.

270
00:21:42,699 --> 00:21:43,800
What exclusive?

271
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,804
About a serial killer.

272
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,105
A serial?

273
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,074
I can show you.

274
00:21:50,399 --> 00:21:51,915
What do you want from me?

275
00:21:52,909 --> 00:21:54,939
- Money? - I don't need money.

276
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:59,254
I just want to teach someone a lesson.

277
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,984
That guy...

278
00:22:01,949 --> 00:22:03,855
who just went into the studio?

279
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,625
It's not one but two guys.

280
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:07,824
Two?

281
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:12,234
- Do you have proof? - I'll give that to you.

282
00:22:12,689 --> 00:22:16,030
You just have to write the story I want.

283
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:18,375
What do you say? Yes or no?

284
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,145
Which one will you pick?

285
00:22:23,239 --> 00:22:25,314
Make up your mind quick.

286
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:36,224
I won this game.

287
00:22:43,421 --> 00:22:44,526
My gosh.

288
00:22:51,861 --> 00:22:54,976
How will Jong Woo feel when he gets this?

289
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,016
Don't you want to know?

290
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,486
Don't kill me.

291
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,625
I'll go and finish this. Wait here.

292
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:42,456
Let's take a break.

293
00:23:52,661 --> 00:23:57,766
(Ji Eun... I'm sorry.)

294
00:24:47,211 --> 00:24:48,315
(Eunhye Patrol Division)

295
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:53,956
Jung Hwa.

296
00:24:55,891 --> 00:24:57,125
You slept here?

297
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:04,065
What's all that?

298
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,236
A case file.

299
00:25:08,901 --> 00:25:10,645
- The studio? - Yes.

300
00:25:13,671 --> 00:25:15,145
Is something going on?

301
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:18,016
You should go home to sleep.

302
00:25:19,611 --> 00:25:20,885
I'll get changed.

303
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,506
(Sorry for the early text. Mr. Shin died yesterday. Did you know?)

304
00:25:45,941 --> 00:25:47,115
Hey, Longhair.

305
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,486
You wanted to kill him...

306
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:54,916
when your girlfriend got out of his car.

307
00:25:55,451 --> 00:25:57,526
He's definitely the killer.

308
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:00,756
Hold on, Jong Woo. Let's stay together here.

309
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,565
You know I like you.

310
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,266
Get out of here.

311
00:26:04,851 --> 00:26:06,395
I can't.

312
00:26:07,091 --> 00:26:08,905
Jong Woo. Please!

313
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:12,036
Please stay with me.

314
00:26:12,131 --> 00:26:14,676
Then yesterday, Seok Yun too...

315
00:26:15,401 --> 00:26:17,345
No. No.

316
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,145
No, no.

317
00:26:29,451 --> 00:26:32,256
911, this is Officer Kim. How can I help?

318
00:26:32,881 --> 00:26:35,280
Murderers. There are murderers.

319
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,451
What? Murderers?

320
00:26:36,451 --> 00:26:39,560
I think there are murderers in the studio I live in.

321
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,621
A studio?

322
00:26:40,621 --> 00:26:42,330
In that studio,

323
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:47,000
these people conspired and they might have...

324
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,101
- Sir, please calm down. - 1, 2...

325
00:26:49,101 --> 00:26:51,300
3, no 4 people.

326
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,901
It's possible that they may have killed more than this.

327
00:26:54,901 --> 00:26:57,545
Did you witness the scene firsthand?

328
00:26:58,211 --> 00:26:59,916
No, I didn't.

329
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,480
- Have you been drinking? - Excuse me?

330
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,711
Sir, if you make a prank call when you're drunk,

331
00:27:04,711 --> 00:27:07,250
you can be subject to punishment.

332
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,280
What did you say?

333
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,451
Making prank calls are also...

334
00:27:09,451 --> 00:27:10,666
- subject to criminal punishment. - Prank calls?

335
00:27:11,391 --> 00:27:12,865
Do you think this is a prank call?

336
00:27:13,391 --> 00:27:16,335
People are getting killed! And you call this a prank call?

337
00:27:16,691 --> 00:27:18,631
Why don't you try the nearest Patrol Division...

338
00:27:18,631 --> 00:27:20,361
- and file a report? - You crazy punks!

339
00:27:20,361 --> 00:27:22,135
I just said people are getting killed!

340
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:26,516
Gosh.

341
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:32,716
What should I do?

342
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,996
(Mom)

343
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,065
(Mom)

344
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,661
Hello, Mom.

345
00:27:46,661 --> 00:27:47,966
Jong Woo.

346
00:27:51,891 --> 00:27:54,736
What's going on? Is everything okay?

347
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,776
It's nothing.

348
00:28:02,611 --> 00:28:03,916
Are you sure?

349
00:28:08,111 --> 00:28:09,256
Anyway.

350
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:12,226
Why did you call so early in the morning?

351
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,926
Did my brother get hurt again?

352
00:28:14,181 --> 00:28:17,526
No. I just thought of you.

353
00:28:19,121 --> 00:28:21,595
Are you sure everything is fine?

354
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,361
Yes. But now I need to get to work.

355
00:28:26,361 --> 00:28:28,976
- Right, eat good breakfast. - Yes.

356
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:30,176
I'll hang...

357
00:28:31,631 --> 00:28:32,875
Jong Woo.

358
00:28:34,101 --> 00:28:36,585
I am always there for you.

359
00:28:36,871 --> 00:28:38,986
- You know that, right? - Yes.

Hello.

363

Are you praying for your son?

364
00:29:08,101 --> 00:29:10,045
Yes, his exam is in just a few days.

365
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,740
Did you say it was Teacher Certificate Examination?

366
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,216
No.

00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:18,851
If so, you should have sent him to our studio.

369
00:29:18,851 --> 00:29:21,121
If he had studied here, he would have passed it right away.

370
00:29:21,121 --> 00:29:23,196
Don't say that. This place...

371
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:28,766
My son is studying at the private academy.

372
00:29:28,861 --> 00:29:29,990
I'll get going.

373
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,266
Ma'am.

374
00:29:32,191 --> 00:29:36,200
These days, my spirit isn't as clear as it should be.

375
00:29:36,201 --> 00:29:38,575
Do you have a few minutes to spare for me?

376
00:29:38,701 --> 00:29:41,045
- I would like to talk to you. - Excuse me?

377
00:29:41,201 --> 00:29:44,270
I am a Christian too.

378
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,585
That's why the studio is called "Eden".

379
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,526
Well, then...

380
00:29:49,911 --> 00:29:52,451
Why don't we go somewhere else and talk?

381
00:29:52,451 --> 00:29:55,121
- Well... But... - Just come with me.

382
00:29:55,121 --> 00:29:56,490
But I should...

383
00:29:56,490 --> 00:29:58,565
I am really struggling these days.

384
00:30:00,691 --> 00:30:02,166
- Just come with me. - Sure.

385
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:05,391
I am a regular here, and it's really nice and quiet.

386
00:30:05,391 --> 00:30:09,305
We can sing gospels if we feel His Grace.

387
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,645
- Let's go in. - Still...

388
00:30:13,401 --> 00:30:15,375
This is spacious.

389
00:30:15,841 --> 00:30:16,911
But isn't this cool and nice?

390
00:30:16,911 --> 00:30:19,711
The government has issued a typhoon watch...

391
00:30:19,711 --> 00:30:22,040
as the typhoon "Gimi" is approaching Korea.

392
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:25,250
Gyeonggi Province is expecting...

393
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,720
hourly precipitation of 30 to 40mm...

394
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:31,696
The promotion of the program can start about eight weeks before.

395
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:34,191
The agency will send us the information about the casting list.

396
00:30:34,191 --> 00:30:36,190
I will send it to you in a week.

397
00:30:36,191 --> 00:30:37,361
Sure.

398
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:39,461
Please put more effort into that casting list.

399
00:30:39,461 --> 00:30:40,800
You know how we start is very important.

400
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,875
Of course I do.

401
00:30:43,401 --> 00:30:44,931
Once the casting list is finalized,

402
00:30:44,931 --> 00:30:47,601
please post it on our social media account,

403
00:30:47,601 --> 00:30:51,010
so we can attract a lot of attention online.

404
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,085
I see.

405
00:30:53,841 --> 00:30:55,926
Is our promotion material ready?

406
00:30:56,911 --> 00:30:59,555
Bo Mi, can you get in touch with Ji Eun?

407
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,550
I am still trying but I can't now.

408
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:04,625
She is so irresponsible.

409
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,696
That's fine.

410
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:10,360
Can we go for Camera Three again?

411
00:31:10,361 --> 00:31:13,236
Ready? Action!

412
00:31:13,401 --> 00:31:17,901
Only that tears that well up

413
00:31:17,901 --> 00:31:21,371
Would know how I feel

414
00:31:21,371 --> 00:31:27,716
That person is you

415
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,585
Come on.

416
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:34,080
- Do you not like to sing? - Not so much.

417
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,851
I wanted to be a singer.

418
00:31:35,851 --> 00:31:38,990
I can live without a man, but I can't live without singing.

419
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:42,036
- Why don't we sing together? - It's fine.

420
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,635
Do you feel disgusted?

421
00:31:43,891 --> 00:31:46,436
You think I killed my husband, right?

422
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:52,000
If you don't think so, let's sing together.

423
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,401
Come here. Sit down.

424
00:31:53,401 --> 00:31:54,746
Sing with me.

425
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:00,111
- I don't want to have that person - Want to have that person

426
00:32:00,111 --> 00:32:03,080
I don't want him

427
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,625
- I just want to love him - I just want to love him

428
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,750
- You don't know - You don't know

429
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:15,560
- That I have a fabulous lover too - That I have a fabulous lover too

430
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:21,776
He is so precious that I hid from everyone else

431
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,145
Jong Woo.

432
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,676
Jong Woo? Did you see the right person?

433
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,686
What's wrong with him?

434
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,496
Why?

435
00:33:22,861 --> 00:33:25,036
Why is this happening?

436
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,876
Do you really not know?

437
00:33:30,031 --> 00:33:32,345
You killed him.

438
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:36,715
You killed both Jae Ho and Seok Yun.

439
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,985
Let's be honest.

440
00:33:42,781 --> 00:33:44,825
You were happy, right?

441
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:46,996
It wasn't me.

442
00:33:48,850 --> 00:33:50,025
It wasn't.

443
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:51,865
I didn't kill them.

444
00:33:52,991 --> 00:33:54,365
I didn't do it.

445
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,766
It wasn't me.

446
00:33:58,261 --> 00:33:59,405
Jong Woo?

447
00:34:02,301 --> 00:34:03,746
What are you doing?

448
00:34:13,711 --> 00:34:18,055
"He would then wake up and look around in the dark."

449
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:22,555
"He then realized that he can't move his body."

450
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:26,635
"But he didn't find that weird."

451
00:34:26,761 --> 00:34:30,936
"He even felt unnatural..."

452
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,876
"that he could move so far with his thin legs."

453
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:35,476
"On the other hand,"

454
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:38,546
"he felt relatively at ease."

455
00:34:42,401 --> 00:34:44,816
Maybe this is how Jong Woo feels right now.

456
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:52,750
Knock knock.

457
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,155
Are you reading a boring book?

458
00:34:55,991 --> 00:34:58,195
I cleaned the room.

459
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:02,515
What if Unit 303 doesn't come back?

460
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,116
What do we do then?

461
00:35:07,511 --> 00:35:09,920
He'll be back soon. Don't worry.

462
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,495
Can you predict the future or what?

463
00:35:12,891 --> 00:35:15,625
How do you know that?

464
00:35:16,561 --> 00:35:19,261
I have a gift for Jong Woo.

465
00:35:19,261 --> 00:35:20,906
He will definitely come to get it.

466
00:35:21,061 --> 00:35:23,676
It's nice to be with us.

467
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:27,446
You can kill anyone you want.

468
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,900
You can do the rest.

469
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,645
Really?

470
00:35:32,041 --> 00:35:34,245
Yes. I need...

471
00:35:34,811 --> 00:35:36,879
to go somewhere.

472
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,316
Where?

473
00:35:39,241 --> 00:35:41,351
Before we leave here,

474
00:35:41,351 --> 00:35:44,196
we need to take care of smelly things.

475
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,825
Of course we do.

476
00:35:46,550 --> 00:35:47,951
Oh yes!

477
00:35:47,951 --> 00:35:51,696
Yes! I am so excited!

478
00:35:55,931 --> 00:35:58,205
It's going to hurt you a little.

479
00:35:58,331 --> 00:36:01,105
Try to withstand it as much as you can.

480
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,415
What did you say?

481
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,285
I can't hear you.

482
00:36:11,511 --> 00:36:12,756
What did you say?

483
00:36:13,951 --> 00:36:15,355
I can't hear you.

484
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:26,636
How could he beat up someone this bad?

485
00:36:28,831 --> 00:36:30,960
That person

486
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,575
- Can only... - Were you out somewhere?

487
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,006
Hey.

488
00:36:34,371 --> 00:36:36,575
I'm leaving here soon...

489
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:40,346
so I just went to cleanse all my sins.

490
00:36:41,041 --> 00:36:42,069
Where are you headed?

491
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:44,355
I have some business to take care of.

492
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,185
Unit 303 is lucky.

493
00:36:49,621 --> 00:36:50,825
By the way,

494
00:36:52,121 --> 00:36:53,265
when...

495
00:36:53,951 --> 00:36:57,096
we get out of here, what are we going to do with them?

496
00:36:57,661 --> 00:36:58,765
I beg your pardon?

497
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:01,431
If Unit 303 comes back,

498
00:37:01,431 --> 00:37:03,336
we need to take care of them!

499
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:06,136
Yes, we should take care of them.

500
00:37:06,771 --> 00:37:08,006
Both of them, right?

501
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:10,216
Yes, both of them.

502
00:37:11,541 --> 00:37:12,676
I'll see you later.

503
00:37:13,110 --> 00:37:14,185
Mun Jo.

504
00:37:15,471 --> 00:37:18,355
We will now only have the good ones here, right?

505
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:27,466
Don't feel pity for me

506
00:37:27,621 --> 00:37:29,296
Someday

507
00:37:36,831 --> 00:37:40,906
Let me check if you are alive.

508
00:37:44,771 --> 00:37:46,641
You're doing quite well!

509
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:48,546
Maybe that's because you are young.

510
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,756
Hey, do you want some meat?

511
00:37:55,011 --> 00:37:56,825
- What? - No.

512
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,150
- Don't kill me. - Well.

513
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:03,035
You ate so much last time!

514
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:12,360
You were such a nice student.

515
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:16,475
Why did you get snatched by the wrong person?

516
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:22,015
But I am not sure.

517
00:38:22,871 --> 00:38:28,555
That Unit 303 punk is another level of crazy.

518
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,596
Well...

519
00:38:34,351 --> 00:38:36,336
what do you think?

520
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:42,736
Don't you think that punk looks down on me?

521
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,205
What do you think?

522
00:38:45,701 --> 00:38:48,745
Do you think that punk looks down on me?

523
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:51,676
He does whatever he wants, right?

524
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,756
That punk killed my brother too!

525
00:38:57,241 --> 00:39:00,325
Now I am getting angry.

526
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:02,026
Darn it!

527
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,596
Darn.

528
00:39:10,291 --> 00:39:13,836
Yes, we were being nice to him...

529
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:18,605
and he thinks we are some kinds of bugs that he can kill?

530
00:39:19,201 --> 00:39:22,230
Should I just kill him?

531
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:25,216
What do you think? Should I just kill him?

532
00:39:25,741 --> 00:39:27,546
Answer me!

533
00:39:29,741 --> 00:39:31,116
- Hey. - Yes?

534
00:39:32,181 --> 00:39:35,851
Do you want to run away from here?

535
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:36,995
Right?

536
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:39,791
Then why don't we have a bet?

537
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:42,121
Let's bet whether you can run away or not.

538
00:39:42,121 --> 00:39:43,495
- Yes. - That's great.

539
00:39:45,261 --> 00:39:47,236
Okay.

540
00:39:47,761 --> 00:39:50,236
Before that punk returns.

541
00:39:51,047 --> 00:39:52,191
All right.

542
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,305
Why don't you start? Go?

543
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,616
Go on. Let's try this.

544
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,116
All right. Start!

545
00:40:00,641 --> 00:40:01,886
You can do it.

546
00:40:02,511 --> 00:40:04,355
Come on. Go.

547
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,526
All right. That's it.

548
00:40:09,851 --> 00:40:12,420
You can get out of here alive. You shouldn't give up.

549
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,566
I think you can do it even if you can't walk.

550
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,765

Hey!

561
00:41:01,431 --> 00:41:02,506
Oh my!

562
00:41:03,201 --> 00:41:05,771
What happened to you?

563
00:41:05,771 --> 00:41:07,785
Please save me.

564
00:41:14,311 --> 00:41:15,511
Goodness.

565
00:41:15,511 --> 00:41:17,555
Oh my goodness.

566

Hide here.

567
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:28,466
I will cover so he can't find you.

568
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:43,616
Ms. Eom, have you seen the student from Unit 310?

569
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:47,825
Well, I heard some noise from the rooftop.

570
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:52,426
Why don't you go to the rooftop?

571
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,625
I caught you.

572
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,526
It's over now.

573
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,296
Were you two having fun?

574
00:42:29,991 --> 00:42:31,066
Come here.

What is this?

577
00:42:58,633 --> 00:43:02,248
I responded to a call last night. Someone mixed poison in food.

578
00:43:04,144 --> 00:43:07,348
The other cats were dead, except for this one.

What's going on over there?

581
00:43:18,383 --> 00:43:19,728
I am scared.

582
00:43:23,294 --> 00:43:24,768
The residents of that studio...

583
00:43:27,093 --> 00:43:28,569
are all very strange.

584
00:43:40,213 --> 00:43:41,648
I don't need anything else.

585
00:43:42,514 --> 00:43:43,889
I just need to move on.

586
00:43:45,044 --> 00:43:46,989
It was just a nightmare.

Sergeant Yun. We have a problem.

590
00:44:01,934 --> 00:44:03,009
What is it?

591
00:44:03,064 --> 00:44:05,708
Sergeant Cho is causing trouble again at the incineration site.

592
00:44:06,034 --> 00:44:07,708
That crazy punk.

593
00:44:08,334 --> 00:44:10,874
He was so quiet these days. Why is he doing it again?

594
00:44:10,874 --> 00:44:12,049
It's you, right?

595
00:44:12,943 --> 00:44:14,188
It's Chang Hyun.

596
00:44:15,474 --> 00:44:17,359
I can't believe we've met here.

597
00:44:17,584 --> 00:44:18,788
What are you up to these days?

598
00:44:19,744 --> 00:44:22,489
I just came back from a funeral of my friend's dad.

599
00:44:23,653 --> 00:44:24,799
Why does your face...

600
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,168
Is everything okay?

601
00:44:31,264 --> 00:44:32,369

603

What is it?

604
00:44:45,903 --> 00:44:47,889
- Is he not answering? - He's not.

605
00:44:50,414 --> 00:44:51,589
Poor thing.

606
00:44:58,084 --> 00:44:59,929
Am I really the police?

607
00:45:01,354 --> 00:45:02,828

610
00:45:09,994 --> 00:45:12,308
Were you two talking behind my back?

611
00:45:12,764 --> 00:45:15,409
- No way. - Work hard.

612
00:45:15,534 --> 00:45:16,708
Yes, sir.

613
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:20,148
Come here, you cute thing.

614
00:45:29,814 --> 00:45:30,998
What is he doing?

615
00:45:55,343 --> 00:45:58,014
- Did you bring it? - Oh, sir.

616
00:45:58,014 --> 00:46:01,029
You're so impatient.

617
00:46:10,963 --> 00:46:12,538
What's inside?

618
00:46:15,494 --> 00:46:17,409
Why did he use such a huge tin?

619
00:46:21,773 --> 00:46:22,934
Are you sure about this?

620
00:46:22,934 --> 00:46:25,418
Yes, I'm very sure about it.

00:46:29,943 --> 00:46:31,989
I'll be posted this evening.

623
00:46:32,514 --> 00:46:34,159
It'll be huge.

624
00:46:34,784 --> 00:46:38,659
I'll post a comment when it's out.

625
00:46:40,553 --> 00:46:43,199

Do you like murderers?

628
00:47:10,184 --> 00:47:12,728
I want to report something bad.

629
00:47:13,184 --> 00:47:16,699
There's a dead body here.

Near the entrance to Eunhye Park.

631

I don't even know where exactly, it's so gruesome.

632
00:47:24,463 --> 00:47:26,378
This neighborhood was quiet...

633
00:47:27,474 --> 00:47:30,248
What's happening here? My goodness.

634
00:47:30,503 --> 00:47:34,389
Yes, please get here soon. Gosh.

635
00:47:49,553 --> 00:47:52,593
Officer Jo, call the detectives first. No.

636
00:47:52,593 --> 00:47:55,668
Call the head of our division first.

637
00:47:56,093 --> 00:47:58,208
Don't touch anything, okay?

638
00:47:58,903 --> 00:48:02,133
What are you doing? Call our head.

639
00:48:02,133 --> 00:48:03,173
Okay.

640
00:48:03,173 --> 00:48:04,549
You should know the protocol.

641
00:48:06,104 --> 00:48:08,748
Make the call now.

642
00:48:10,113 --> 00:48:13,089
Did she have to vomit over there?

643
00:48:18,454 --> 00:48:20,029
Shall we order something?

644
00:48:23,093 --> 00:48:27,308
Can we move to a table in the corner?

645
00:48:27,994 --> 00:48:29,969
What for?

646
00:48:35,403 --> 00:48:36,779
Is this spot better?

647
00:48:37,974 --> 00:48:39,078
Yes.

648
00:48:40,613 --> 00:48:42,514
Why are you in Seoul?

649
00:48:42,514 --> 00:48:43,958
Your family's in Busan.

650
00:48:44,744 --> 00:48:45,819
What?

651
00:48:46,244 --> 00:48:49,684
A senior from university found me a job here.

652
00:48:49,684 --> 00:48:51,958
Oh, you're here to work.

653
00:48:52,584 --> 00:48:54,029

Jong Woo.

658
00:49:14,213 --> 00:49:16,688
It's a bit weird that I'm doing this...

659
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:19,288
when I didn't call you once...

660
00:49:19,314 --> 00:49:21,589
after we both left the army.

661
00:49:21,983 --> 00:49:24,898
I personally feel that...

662
00:49:25,124 --> 00:49:27,894
you're like a real brother to me.

663
00:49:27,894 --> 00:49:29,569
I'm so grateful.

664
00:49:30,093 --> 00:49:31,469
You know why.

665
00:49:31,963 --> 00:49:34,268
My dad died when I was a private,

666
00:49:34,593 --> 00:49:37,609
and had a hard time getting used to army life.

667
00:49:38,604 --> 00:49:41,003
You were the only one who cared for me.

668
00:49:41,003 --> 00:49:43,204
Only you looked out for me...

669
00:49:43,204 --> 00:49:44,978
and worried about me.

670
00:49:45,303 --> 00:49:48,144
I've been working for a while now,

671
00:49:48,144 --> 00:49:50,989
and no one has done that for me since.

672
00:49:51,213 --> 00:49:52,359
I mean it.

673
00:49:53,483 --> 00:49:55,688
I'm so grateful for that.

674
00:49:56,153 --> 00:49:58,058
I still think about it.

675
00:49:58,184 --> 00:50:01,598
That's why I want to help you out...

676
00:50:03,224 --> 00:50:07,938
as best I can if you're in a tough spot.

677
00:50:10,503 --> 00:50:12,509
You can tell me what's going on.

678
00:50:21,113 --> 00:50:23,744
Darn these bugs. We can run the car's registration.

679
00:50:23,744 --> 00:50:25,414
Then we can get what we need.

680
00:50:25,414 --> 00:50:26,983
Hand these over.

681
00:50:26,983 --> 00:50:28,159
Yes, sir.

682
00:50:30,084 --> 00:50:31,558
Hello.

683
00:50:31,753 --> 00:50:32,753
We meet often.

684
00:50:32,753 --> 00:50:33,954
Yes.

685
00:50:33,954 --> 00:50:37,193
Is this case connected to Shin Jae Ho's death?

686
00:50:37,193 --> 00:50:38,994
The MO's completely different.

687
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:41,494
Mr. Shin got a tranquilizer shot in his neck...

688
00:50:41,494 --> 00:50:43,369
before he was hit in the head.

689
00:50:43,463 --> 00:50:45,909
This guy was stabbed in the neck.

690
00:50:46,104 --> 00:50:47,949
What are you doing here?

691
00:50:50,133 --> 00:50:52,279
The two people knew each other.

692
00:50:52,303 --> 00:50:53,848
They knew each other?

693
00:50:54,113 --> 00:50:56,672
I don't think it's connected to the studio though.

694
00:50:56,673 --> 00:50:58,983
It could be resentment or revenge.

695
00:50:58,983 --> 00:51:00,558
We'll find out by investigating.

696
00:51:00,684 --> 00:51:02,228
- Let's go. - Okay.

697
00:51:16,394 --> 00:51:17,708
So basically,

698
00:51:18,403 --> 00:51:20,038
you're done for.

699
00:51:20,104 --> 00:51:22,348
You're in a bad spot.

700
00:51:23,104 --> 00:51:24,449
Let's see.

701
00:51:25,104 --> 00:51:28,989
So all the people who left the studio...

702
00:51:29,374 --> 00:51:31,719
seem to have gone missing.

703
00:51:31,983 --> 00:51:34,688
And you think a few of them...

704
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:38,859
are locked up in the 4th floor of the building.

705
00:51:39,483 --> 00:51:42,168
Including your university senior.

706
00:51:43,023 --> 00:51:45,569
- The funeral I was at. - Yes.

707
00:51:47,023 --> 00:51:49,069
It was for my senior.

708
00:51:51,704 --> 00:51:53,038
My gosh.

709
00:51:56,704 --> 00:51:57,978
Jong Woo.

710
00:51:59,244 --> 00:52:02,648
It doesn't make sense at all.

711
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:05,288
We're right in the middle of Seoul.

712
00:52:05,483 --> 00:52:08,153
Such dreadful things are happening here?

713
00:52:08,153 --> 00:52:09,889
Unless those people are...

714
00:52:10,053 --> 00:52:11,854
completely out of their minds...

715
00:52:11,854 --> 00:52:13,029
They are crazy.

716
00:52:14,494 --> 00:52:15,828
They're psychos.

717
00:52:20,963 --> 00:52:24,308
Did you call the police? What did they say?

718
00:52:25,963 --> 00:52:27,478
They asked if I'm drunk...

719
00:52:28,303 --> 00:52:29,848
and that I shouldn't make prank calls.

720
00:52:36,914 --> 00:52:38,389
(Ji Eun)

721
00:52:46,483 --> 00:52:47,869
Ji Eun.

722
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:51,139
Jong Woo...

723
00:53:14,383 --> 00:53:17,153
(I brought him to Seoul and I feel bad.)

724
00:53:17,153 --> 00:53:19,883
(I'm outside your place. Can you come out?)

725
00:53:19,883 --> 00:53:21,529
(It won't take long.)

726
00:53:27,863 --> 00:53:32,038
(Are you really Jae Ho? You sound different.)

727
00:53:35,974 --> 00:53:40,819
(How did you know that I'm at home?)

728
00:53:43,943 --> 00:53:46,489
(Jae Ho)

729
00:54:10,604 --> 00:54:11,819
Excuse me.

730
00:54:14,613 --> 00:54:15,819
Hello.

731
00:54:19,144 --> 00:54:21,259
What are you doing here?

732
00:54:21,314 --> 00:54:23,089
Jong Woo gave me the address.

733
00:54:23,213 --> 00:54:24,483
He did?

734
00:54:24,483 --> 00:54:25,558
Yes.

735
00:54:26,784 --> 00:54:28,869
He asked me to give you this.

736
00:54:31,023 --> 00:54:33,469
Where is he right now?

737
00:54:33,963 --> 00:54:36,668
I know where he is. Come with me.

738
00:54:38,104 --> 00:54:39,509
No, thanks.

739
00:55:12,403 --> 00:55:14,179
Jong Woo...

740
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:19,949
It's me.

741
00:55:22,144 --> 00:55:24,049
Why are you with Ji Eun?

742
00:55:26,314 --> 00:55:29,389
Your girlfriend wants to see you.

743
00:55:30,213 --> 00:55:31,598
I beg of you.

744
00:55:32,383 --> 00:55:35,193
Please don't touch Ji Eun.

745
00:55:35,193 --> 00:55:36,628
Please don't.

746
00:55:37,294 --> 00:55:38,398
Okay?

747
00:55:38,693 --> 00:55:41,538
Well, I have a different idea.

748
00:55:46,303 --> 00:55:47,704
Are you going to...

749
00:55:47,704 --> 00:55:50,378
It's exactly what you think.

750
00:55:52,443 --> 00:55:54,589
This woman means nothing to me.

751
00:55:55,374 --> 00:55:56,719
You psycho.

752
00:55:57,943 --> 00:56:01,759
If you so much as touch a hair on her, I'll kill you.

753
00:56:02,784 --> 00:56:04,498
I'll kill you, okay?

754
00:56:05,423 --> 00:56:06,498
Jong Woo.

755
00:56:10,764 --> 00:56:14,538
She wants you to stay like the guy from Unit 310 did.

756
00:56:15,863 --> 00:56:17,233
Will you run away again?

757
00:56:17,233 --> 00:56:18,779
You lunatic!

758
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:21,409
Ji Eun. Ji Eun!

759
00:56:23,374 --> 00:56:25,049
I will kill you.

760
00:56:25,443 --> 00:56:27,848
I'll kill you. Where are you?

761
00:56:28,014 --> 00:56:29,219
Where are you?

762
00:56:30,073 --> 00:56:31,219
I'm excited.

763
00:56:33,213 --> 00:56:35,128
I'll be waiting in your room.

764
00:56:51,334 --> 00:56:52,478
Taxi!

765
00:56:58,343 --> 00:56:59,443
Wait, wait.

766
00:56:59,443 --> 00:57:01,418
To Eunhye-dong and be quick.

767
00:57:01,874 --> 00:57:03,744
- I'm coming too. - I have to hurry.

768
00:57:03,744 --> 00:57:05,684
You can't go alone into a room of psychos.

769
00:57:05,684 --> 00:57:06,814
Scoot to the side.

770
00:57:06,814 --> 00:57:08,288
You can go now.

771
00:57:16,994 --> 00:57:19,268
I was on my way back.

772
00:57:36,213 --> 00:57:37,213
(Eden Studio)

773
00:57:37,213 --> 00:57:38,389
If I go inside,

774
00:57:39,814 --> 00:57:41,688
can I come back out alive?

775
00:57:43,713 --> 00:57:46,598
But at that moment, I realized that...

776
00:57:47,954 --> 00:57:51,569
I can no longer escape or hide.

777
00:58:21,954 --> 00:58:24,469
(Stranger from Hell)

778
00:58:25,423 --> 00:58:28,369
If you go inside, you'll both get hurt.

779
00:58:28,693 --> 00:58:29,863
I'll come over.

780
00:58:29,863 --> 00:58:31,509
- Don't move. - Jong Woo.

781
00:58:31,863 --> 00:58:33,604
Aren't you having fun?

782
00:58:33,604 --> 00:58:36,434
Whoever you want, you can kill...

783
00:58:36,434 --> 00:58:38,248
or let live.

784
00:58:38,644 --> 00:58:39,843
You feel like a deity.

785
00:58:39,843 --> 00:58:43,288
No. No human being does what you do.

786
00:58:43,414 --> 00:58:46,958
This hell will end once you die.

787
00:58:47,343 --> 00:58:48,453
Okay then.

788
00:58:48,454 --> 00:58:52,429
How about you finish the novel you started?
