NO OUTSIDE VISITORS
ALLOWED IN THE RESIDENCE

2
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:45,382
ALL CHARACTERS, LOCATIONS, ORGANIZATIONS

3
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:48,382
AND INCIDENTS APPEARING
IN THIS FILM ARE FICTITIOUS

4
00:00:55,722 --> 00:00:58,222
Try this. It's to die for.

5
00:00:58,308 --> 00:00:59,388
Okay.

6
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:08,403
Ms. Um made it for us. Try some.

7
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:09,897
Okay.

8
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,540
Maybe it's because I just saw a dead cat.

9
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,752
It tastes kind of odd.

10
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,127
I guess you don't really like it.

11
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:35,255
Yes, it's not really for me.

12
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,636
I guess this part isn't for you.

13
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:45,061
-What?
-There are other parts. Do you want some?

14
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:49,072
It's pretty late. Let's have a quick drink
and call it a day.

15
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:02,162
That's weird. This is good meat.

16
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,268
Why do you look so startled?

17
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:25,055
Do you think this is human meat
or something?

18
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,909
I'll get going first.
I have to be at work tomorrow.

19
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:44,963
Sure.

20
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,789
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

21
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,443
He finally closed his door.

22
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,446
I guess that pervert listens to
what the landlord says.

23
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,551
That's odd. This is great meat.

24
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,223
Why doesn't he like it?

25
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:50,193
Gosh. He must be very sensitive.

26
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,901
It's perfect for my taste.

27
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,357
Should I add some seasoning?

28
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,911
Then we'll lose
the natural taste of the meat.

29
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,156
Right?

30
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:33,359
What a relief. It's still the same.

31
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,644
It looks just like the picture too.

32
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:19,187
Why did he make that face?

33
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:38,246
Hey.

34
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,128
What?

35
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,724
-Behind us.
-Who's behind us?

36
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,509
Look behind. Behind.

37
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,266
-What?
-Do you want to die?

38
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,268
You told me to look behind, you jerk.

39
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,983
-You're a crazy idiot.
-Keep driving! Look ahead!

40
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,216
I... I didn't kill 13 cats.

41
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:29,352
-What?
-I... I killed one.

42
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,269
He... Hello.

43
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,401
Can you turn down the volume?

44
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,857
I... I can't hear you.

45
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:45,154
Please turn down the music.

46
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,738
Oh, okay.

47
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:52,617
What is it?

48
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:57,460
They've always been weird

49
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:59,462
ever since the day they were born.

50
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:03,965
Your left taillight is out.

51
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,633
It's too dangerous
to drive around at night like this.

52
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,387
Make sure you get that fixed tomorrow.

53
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,182
Who... Who broke that?

54
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,385
This is so annoying.

55
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,515
In that case...

56
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,608
He said he was scared.

57
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:37,539
Sir, may I check your trunk?

58
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,875
Why do you need to do that?

59
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:45,212
I just have something to check.
Please cooperate.

60
00:07:56,267 --> 00:07:57,227
Go ahead and look.

61
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,477
That's liquid from food waste.

62
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,994
It's too dangerous to drive around
with a broken taillight,

63
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:17,617
-so make sure you get it fixed tomorrow.
-Yes.

64
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,039
Don't police officers go around in pairs?

65
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,047
Pardon?

66
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,005
But you're alone.

67
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:37,387
We go around to... together.

68
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,788
Hey, you're the BB gun guy.

69
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:58,623
May we go?

70
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,294
-Sure, go ahead.
-Yes, goodbye.

71
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,627
Are you headed to your residence?

72
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,002
Yes, we are. Why?

73
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,128
Nothing. Goodbye.

74
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:18,852
What's going on?

75
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,391
Nothing.

76
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:41,293
Goodness, it's late. I should go to bed.

77
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:49,962
That... That was so hilarious.

78
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:54,509
They've been running amok
ever since that gangster disappeared.

79
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,733
I'm glad I made some progress
on my writing in a long time.

80
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:11,025
Okay. I'll try writing little by little
every day.

81
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,662
Was that put up there
by the foreigner who lived here before?

82
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,863
Sergeant Cho?

83
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,499
Sergeant Cho, what are you doing?

84
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,182
-Do you want to try some?
-This is human meat.

85
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:19,072
-Grandma.
-Thank you, young lady.

86
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:20,985
Grandma, I'm leaving.

87
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,707
Young lady.

88
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,205
My husband is a nice man.

89
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,301
Please find my husband.

90
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,630
Please find him. Please.

91
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,143
I'll find him for you.

92
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:46,217
You haven't gone to school?

93
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:48,597
I'm too old to go to school.

94
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,016
Good for you, Dad.
You became a high school kid.

95
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,563
-Are you teasing me?
-Yes.

96
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,726
Get to work already. Watch out for cars.

97
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,236
Yes. I'm leaving, Dad.

98
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,241
Grandma, I'm leaving.

99
00:13:02,323 --> 00:13:03,743
Goodbye.

100
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,744
-Be careful.
-Okay.

101
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,207
She's a very nice looking young lady.

102
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,540
Of course. She's your granddaughter.

103
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:17,384
That young lady looks very nice.

104
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:23,641
Dr. Seo, hello.

105
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,851
Long time no see.
You must've been busy lately.

106
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,481
-I haven't seen you for a while.
-Hello.

107
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,101
Hi, Se-eun.

108
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:35,194
She's very shy.

109
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:39,032
-Goodbye, then.
-Wait, Dr. Seo.

110
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:41,529
Are you free this weekend?

111
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:45,032
Our women's society is going to an event
at a nursing home... I mean, volunteering.

112
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:49,371
We're going volunteering,
so I was wondering if you could...

113
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,499
If you could volunteer as a dentist
for the elderly. One second, please.

114
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,632
Hello?

115
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,842
Why, hello. Is Hak-su doing well?

116
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:02,971
Yes. I'll call you right back. Okay.

117
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,795
I'm sorry. Anyway, can you make it?

118
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:10,182
I'm busy this weekend. I'm sorry.

119
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:13,556
-I see. Then maybe next time.
-Okay.

120
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:17,982
See you around, Se-eun.

121
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,986
Se-eun, you always get shy
whenever you see him.

122
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,208
He's scary.

123
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,180
Oh, right.

124
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,933
I should do this every day.

125
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,437
Calm down.

126
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,609
We have a new guy here too.

127
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:45,816
He didn't seem like a type
who'd move out of this residence.

128
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:48,913
Goodness.

129
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,825
Should I just kill him?

130
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:01,883
What did you say?

131
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,057
Calm down.

132
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:24,106
I should calm down.

133
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,653
I can't deal with a guy like him
and go down to his level.

134
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:37,075
Goodness, hello.

135
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,207
-Who are you?
-I stopped by here--

136
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,539
-Oh, the officer who stopped by.
-Yes.

137
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,415
Gosh, you look so much younger

138
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,883
-without your uniform on.
-You look beautiful today too.

139
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,005
-Me?
-Are you going somewhere?

140
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,551
I'm volunteering to help senior citizens.

141
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,675
Oh, you're doing good work.

142
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,310
-You must have volunteered before.
-What?

143
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,268
It didn't seem like
this was your first time.

144
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:02,979
Gosh.

145
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,363
That must be why

146
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,280
homeless people always swarm
around me out on the street.

147
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,032
Anyway, what brings you here?
Are you here to see me?

148
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:14,833
I wanted to ask you something.

149
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,661
-I was about to leave.
-It's him.

150
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,250
He's the guy who used to live in room 303.

151
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,878
Do you know that he went missing?

152
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,748
Of course, I reported him as missing.

153
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:30,129
Someone who lived here before you
committed suicide.

154
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,842
-Missing? He didn't kill himself?
-Going to work?

155
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:34,927
Yes.

156
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,885
-Then what? Did you find him?
-No, we're looking for him.

157
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,100
You haven't found him yet?
Goodness, this is disappointing.

158
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:46,518
I didn't want to say anything,

159
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:50,687
but what are the police doing?
You're awfully speedy with these things.

160
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,568
That's why I'm going to work hard
to investigate this.

161
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,405
You can't do anything alone.

162
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,371
-Make sure you patrol this area at night.
-I will.

163
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,832
People that pee everywhere
are making my life difficult.

164
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,369
Young man. Why haven't you left?

165
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Were you waiting for me?

166
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,376
No, I left something up there.

167
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,554
-Young lady, I'm late. I have to go.
-Okay.

168
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,926
-Goodbye.
-Give me a call.

169
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:19,182
-Okay? When you find him.
-Sure. Goodbye.

170
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,604
Where did he go?
He left all his stuff here.

171
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,233
Goodness, where could he be?

172
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,900
Excuse me, hello. Hello.

173
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:35,276
-We just met in front of the residence.
-What?

174
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,914
-Didn't we meet in front of the residence?
-Yes.

175
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:41,041
Yes, may I have a short chat with you?

176
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,252
I have to get to work.

177
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,130
Sounds great. I'll give you a ride, then.

178
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,710
-No, I'll walk.
-I won't take long.

179
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,263
Okay? Please.

180
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,429
Should I let you off at the bus stop?

181
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,188
Yes, over there.

182
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:12,067
How long have you been living
in that residence?

183
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:13,532
Four days.

184
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,736
-I see.
-I overheard you talking,

185
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:20,162
and that foreigner... The foreign man
who lived there went missing?

186
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,452
Yes, but they all seem very calm.

187
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,461
Was anybody else reported as missing
other than that man?

188
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:35,467
Did someone else go missing
from that residence?

189
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:40,764
The landlord told me
that the man moved out,

190
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,636
but it was weird how he suddenly left,

191
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,643
and he didn't seem like a type
who'd leave like that.

192
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,767
And a detective recently came by.

193
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:50,515
-A detective?
-Yes.

194
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:55,066
May I have his number?

195
00:19:56,528 --> 00:20:00,448
I have his name card,

196
00:20:00,532 --> 00:20:02,622
but it's in my office,
so I'll send it to you later.

197
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:06,411
Okay, then. This is my number.

198
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,120
I'll be grateful if you could contact me.

199
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,875
Give me a call.

200
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,508
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

201
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,592
Yes.

202
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,899
Your ancestor must have lived
a virtuous life.

203
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,857
Goodness, hello. You look very nice.

204
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,453
Your ancestor must have lived
a virtuous life.

205
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,374
Did you just move here?

206
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,293
Hello, ma'am.

207
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,254
Your face is gleaming.

208
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,045
Your ancestor must have lived
a virtuous life.

209
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:59,843
Do you live around here?
You must be going somewhere nice.

210
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,307
Is something on my face?

211
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,312
Goodness, no.

212
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,770
Anyway, am I really gleaming?

213
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,903
Goodness, that's interesting.

214
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:20,243
Of course, you are.

215
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,414
Anyway, aren't there a lot of people

216
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,910
who's been getting sick around you?

217
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:30,253
Gosh, how did you know?
You're really uncanny.

218
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,800
Instead of standing around,
do you want to go to a cafe,

219
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,338
have a cup of tea, and chat?

220
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,466
No, why don't you come to my place?

221
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:46,681
It's right over that hill.
I'll treat you to a cup of tea.

222
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,390
Really?

223
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,274
I knew I had a good feeling about you.

224
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:54,441
You're such a nice lady.

225
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,355
Why don't you come over
and tell me this and that?

226
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,531
-Sure. Of course.
-Let's go.

227
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,569
Goodness, you're really uncanny.

228
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:07,199
Great work. Goodbye.

229
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:16,842
JONG-U, I'M IN DAEHAK-RO RIGHT NOW

230
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:20,008
AND I WANTED TO STOP BY TO SEE YOU,
SO CAN YOU SPARE SOME TIME NOW?

231
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,910
JONG-U, I'M COMING TO YOUR OFFICE
IT'S ON THE 4TH FLOOR, RIGHT?

232
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,212
JI-EUN, WAIT

233
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,552
I'LL COME DOWN

234
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:02,922
Ji-eun!

235
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:06,134
-Hey. You're so pretty now.
-Long time no see.

236
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:08,298
-Stop it.
-Come over here.

237
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,220
-Everyone, say hi to her.
-Hello.

238
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,385
This is Jong-u's girlfriend
whom I've mentioned before.

239
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,064
-I see.
-Isn't she pretty, Yu-jeong?

240
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,648
Everyone is pretty at that age.

241
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:20,358
Come on, Mr. Shin. Yu-jeong is pretty too.

242
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,150
Yes, she's prettier than me.

243
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,994
Really? Right.
She used to be a stage actress.

244
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,488
Don't mind me and keep working.

245
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,529
Come here. Let's grab some coffee.

246
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:34,037
It's okay, Jae-ho. I have to leave soon.
I just stopped by to see him.

247
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:36,621
I haven't seen him
ever since he came to Seoul.

248
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:39,536
-Really?
-So don't make him work too hard.

249
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,666
Hey, what do you think of me?
Say something.

250
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,054
-He gives me an easy time.
-Yes.

251
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:47,881
Goodness, hardly.
I really have to go. Bye.

252
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,053
You should at least have a cup of coffee.

253
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:52,467
I really came by to see him.

254
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,886
I have to humor my boss too.

255
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:57,894
You still play for the Premier League.
Look, we're like a community soccer team.

256
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,608
I never know when I'll get fired. Bye.

257
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:06,363
Jae-ho, I'll go downstairs to...
I mean, Mr. Shin, I'll see her...

258
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,700
You don't even have to ask.
You should see her off.

259
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,870
-Yes.
-Bye.

260
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:12,778
Wait, wait. Wait.

261
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,787
Good for you, Jong-u.

262
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,294
You have such a great girlfriend.

263
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,246
Gosh, I'm so jealous.

264
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:28,132
-I didn't see your text.
-I only texted you.

265
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,256
Go into the shadow.

266
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:34,175
And I wanted to give you this.

267
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,394
What's this?

268
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:38,103
When I went to fix my laptop,

269
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:41,895
they were giving away prizes
right out front with a dart game.

270
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,980
This is actually the prize
for the last place.

271
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,699
But... But I thought it'll suit you.

272
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,358
Okay, okay.

273
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:53,117
-You wanted to walk me to give me this.
-Something like that.

274
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:56,195
It's cute. I'll put it on my bag. Thanks.

275
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,286
-Okay.
-Gosh.

276
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,749
Right, is the guy
in the corner your direct senior?

277
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:01,832
Oh, yes.

278
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,292
-He seemed really weird.
-Really?

279
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:06,247
Why didn't he say hi when I walked in?

280
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,958
-It made me feel awkward.
-I see.

281
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:11,094
-Are we meeting this weekend?
-Ji-eun... We will.

282
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,506
-Go, now.
-Okay. I'll get going.

283
00:25:12,594 --> 00:25:15,514
Wait, wait.
There's a taxi. You should take it.

284
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:16,557
Okay.

285
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,274
Thanks.

286
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,517
-Call me.
-Okay.

287
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,444
Okay. Go back safely.

288
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:55,099
Is it because I didn't get enough sleep?
I'm seeing things now.

289
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,017
Jong-u.

290
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:06,516
She seemed very hot for you, didn't she?

291
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:07,606
What?

292
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:12,107
I mean,
it seemed like she likes you a lot.

293
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:13,737
Jae-ho.

294
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:19,825
Don't say something like that
about Ji-eun. It's offensive.

295
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:26,673
I was just joking. Don't be so angry.

296
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:32,665
Yu-jeong,
did you think I crossed the line?

297
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,308
-What about you, Mr. Ko?
-What?

298
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:42,270
Oh, yes. You got a bit too sensitive.

299
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,020
I think he was just joking.

300
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,102
Right?

301
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:49,364
See that? You're the odd one out.

302
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:53,488
See? I told you he was weird.

303
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:57,409
You're odd.

304
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:01,487
Let's go eat lunch.

305
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,711
Crazy jerks.

306
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,039
Have some.

307
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:10,128
I have an important guest,
but that's the only thing I have.

308
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,551
Don't worry.

309
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,724
Who... Who's this lady?

310
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,050
Hey, hello.

311
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,930
I met her out on the street,

312
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,933
and she's very spiritual.

313
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,770
I had some questions,
so I brought her over for a chat.

314
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,654
Do you want to join us?

315
00:27:30,774 --> 00:27:31,824
Come here.

316
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:37,695
You can now speak at ease.

317
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:41,155
What about him? What do you see about him?

318
00:27:42,118 --> 00:27:43,698
It sounds fun!

319
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,249
Your ears are parted in two.

320
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:55,763
I see someone else there.
A brother or a sister?

321
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,260
Goodness, my gosh. That's amazing.

322
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:03,262
See that? I told you. She's really good.

323
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,558
Really. Do it again! Again!

324
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,807
You're in bad luck this year.

325
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:16,031
You're in bad luck. Goodness.

326
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:18,241
-That's bad news.
-What's that? What does it mean?

327
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:20,617
It means you have bad luck.

328
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:27,083
Don't come closer.
You'll give me bad luck too.

329
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:30,503
Does this mean I'm going to have bad luck?

330
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,093
Well, that's not it.

331
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:35,876
You have bad karma because of the sins

332
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,924
your ancestors have committed.

333
00:28:38,007 --> 00:28:40,257
-You can come pray with us--
-Gosh!

334
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:43,183
Me... Me? I sinned?

335
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:46,023
You sinned. Goodness, that's bad news.

336
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,395
She... She said you're spiritual.

337
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:53,768
Then... do you think it's a man

338
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:58,108
-or a woman?
-What?

339
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,530
The... The person you said

340
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,160
you could see.

341
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,710
He seems like a man.

342
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:17,842
Then,

343
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:22,723
do you think he's older or younger?

344
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,056
-Isn't he younger?
-My gosh!

345
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,614
Wrong!

346
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:41,146
Man, you can't get anything right.

347
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:46,447
You can't guess it right.

348
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,995
I'll get going.

349
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,929
Oh, goodness.

350
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,562
She seems weird.

351
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:14,977
Ma'am.

352
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,645
Why do you think there are
so many sick people around me?

353
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:19,940
What?

354
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,453
I made them sick.

355
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,236
You didn't know that?

356
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,121
Please spare my life.

357
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,161
-Spare my life.
-You didn't see what'll happen to you,

358
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,825
yet you tried to say you're spiritual?

359
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,206
Unbelievable.

360
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,634
What's going on?

361
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,800
Gosh. What a jerk.
He's even worse than beasts.

362
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,722
Even beasts won't do such a thing.

363
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,507
It's because there's no death penalty--

364
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:51,135
Wait, did you watch the news two days ago?
There was a hydrochloric acid attack.

365
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:53,184
-Yes, I saw that.
-They caught the culprit.

366
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:55,308
You're bringing up a weird topic again
while we're eating.

367
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,435
No, listen up.

368
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,981
The culprit was a CEO of a small business.

369
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:01,147
He used to donate a lot of money

370
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,534
and had a great reputation,
and he's married with children.

371
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:07,321
Then do you think criminals walk around
with a sign that says, "I'm a murderer"?

372
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,697
That's exactly what I'm saying.

373
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,735
Criminals like him
usually look perfectly normal.

374
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,830
You're right.

375
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,962
Jong-u and I saw a guy
who almost got beaten up to death

376
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,329
when we went out to grab a drink.

377
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,206
-Really?
-Yes.

378
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:21,378
That guy's eyes suddenly went crazy
and started beating him like a lunatic.

379
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,007
But Jong-u broke them apart.

380
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,295
-He can be kind of wacky.
-Gosh.

381
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:28,050
That's so cool.

382
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,468
Jong-u, have some raw beef.

383
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,598
You probably can't eat this
at a residence.

384
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:34,307
You need the nutrition.

385
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,637
This place has great meat.

386
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,203
Are you okay?

387
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,407
He must have an upset stomach.

388
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,947
Did he just throw up after seeing my face?

389
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,078
No way.

390
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,575
That's a possibility.

391
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,957
Gosh, you're really mean.
I'm the CEO, okay?

392
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,086
Eat up.

393
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,817
I know how people like you are.

394
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:29,571
I had a junior like you
back when I was in the army.

395
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,574
He was a type
who pretended like he was normal,

396
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,488
but he always badmouthed others
behind their backs.

397
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:37,706
It must be your thing to get
people's sympathy with that pretty face.

398
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,957
But no, it won't work for me.

399
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,501
What in the world are you talking about?

400
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,845
Should I just kill him?

401
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:04,194
Should I just kill him?

402
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,658
The more I think about it,
the more annoying this is.

403
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:20,123
Anyway, how's the intern doing?

404
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,245
He barely does anything.

405
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,877
Come on, don't be like that.
Do look after him with love

406
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,052
as if he was your little brother.

407
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:32,007
I once saw him whimpering
like a lost puppy all by himself.

408
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,803
He really doesn't know anything.

409
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:37,718
Shouldn't he learn a little more
before he comes out to work?

410
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,849
Come on, that's why you can do
a better job at teaching him.

411
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:46,404
-Jong-u, are you all right?
-Yes, I'm fine.

412
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:51,953
It breaks my heart to see a guy
who lives at a residence get sick.

413
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,778
Do you want to go get some air?

414
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:59,004
You can't ventilate a room at a residence.
There's practically no window.

415
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,084
Once you go in there,
you can never come out.

416
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,337
You're all done already?

417
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,670
You can all go in first.
I need to have a chat with Jong-u.

418
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:14,088
-Whoa, bromance.
-Yes, sir.

419
00:34:16,012 --> 00:34:18,312
Are you sure you're okay?
Do you want to leave early?

420
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,354
No, I'm fine. It's just an upset stomach.

421
00:34:20,433 --> 00:34:24,313
You're way too young to be that sick.
Does your residence give you any food?

422
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:25,560
Wait, Jae-ho.

423
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,284
Can you please stop mentioning
that I live in a residence around people?

424
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,648
Man, why is this melting so much?

425
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:35,067
-Why? Are you embarrassed?
-No, it's not that.

426
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:39,041
Hey, people who just started working
usually start off...

427
00:34:39,118 --> 00:34:40,788
Will you please just stop mentioning

428
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:44,120
-that I live at a residence around others?
-What?

429
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,957
You haven't...
You haven't even lived in one.

430
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:53,796
What's with your attitude, jerk?

431
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,971
I'm sorry. I don't feel so--

432
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:03,226
Shit. That's way too gross to eat.

433
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:09,612
Yoon Jong-u, let's try to be
more professional at work, okay?

434
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:12,781
I'm the CEO and you're my employee
when we're at work.

435
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,400
Have you ever seen an employee
who talks back at the CEO?

436
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:16,908
-You--
-Jae-ho, I wasn't talking back.

437
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,159
And stop calling me Jae-ho, okay?

438
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,543
This is exactly
why you can't control your emotions.

439
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,416
Gosh, so annoying.
There's no use in helping others.

440
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,640
Look at how sweaty you are.

441
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:53,402
What's so scary
that you're wetting yourself?

442
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:58,279
That new deity of yours
will soon save your life,

443
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,527
isn't that so?

444
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,076
Do you remember me now?

445
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:13,956
It's me. Bok-sun.

446
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:17,632
Um Bok-sun, the girl you were mean to
because I ate too much.

447
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,152
You finally remembered.

448
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,900
I remembered you
as soon as I ran into you before.

449
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:40,162
Life can be very funny.

450
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:51,831
I have to get back to work.
You can play with her.

451
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,419
Okay.

452
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,045
Shall I begin?

453
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:10,477
CHA SEONG-RYEOL

454
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:18,987
Yes, hello?

455
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:23,032
Yes, I'm the guy you met
in front of the residence this morning.

456
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,405
Yes, Jong-u. Hello.

457
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,700
I just took a picture of his name card
and sent it to you.

458
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:30,371
Right, yes. Thank you.

459
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:34,751
You can go ahead and check that.
I have to get to work, so goodbye.

460
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,295
-Wait.
-Yes?

461
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:39,335
May I feel free to give you a call

462
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,843
if I ever need to talk to you?

463
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,558
Yes, go ahead.
I have to get back to work. Goodbye.

464
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:49,729
-Yes, thank you. Yes.
-Yes, officer.

465
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:52,772
Officer? Is something going on?

466
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:54,814
Oh, it's nothing.

467
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:58,029
It's not nothing.
I can tell something is going on. Tell me.

468
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,529
Jae-ho, it really isn't a big deal.

469
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,406
-Let's go.
-Are you still sulking?

470
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,664
I can tell by the sound of your voice.

471
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:12,214
Do you think this is just a school club?
This is real life.

472
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:15,785
I'm the CEO who pays you,
and you're an employee on my payroll.

473
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,626
Will you keep showing your emotions
like this?

474
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,302
Hey.

475
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,013
Smile.

476
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:25,011
-What?
-I said, show me a smile.

477
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:30,556
Jae-ho, what's with you?

478
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,521
-"Jae-ho"?
-I mean, Mr. Shin, I really--

479
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,102
Do you think I'm joking?

480
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:37,937
Smile.

481
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,625
-Behave yourself, will you?
-Yes.

482
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,844
Special Detective Division.
This is Detective Lee Gwang-jae.

483
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,173
Yes, hello.

484
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:49,047
This is Officer So Jeong-hwa
of Eunhye Patrol Division.

485
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:50,596
Why is the patrol division calling?

486
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,388
Well, actually,

487
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:55,943
I'd like to contact
Detective Cha Seong-ryeol,

488
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:58,598
but his phone seems to be off.

489
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:02,777
Detective Cha? He's on a leave,
so we can't reach him either.

490
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:03,978
I see, he's on a leave?

491
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,698
Yes, he hasn't been picking up our calls
for a few days either.

492
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,239
Anyway, why do you need to talk to him?

493
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:12,452
Yes, right. He met someone
at a residence in our jurisdiction,

494
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,365
then that man went missing,

495
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:18,084
so I wanted to ask him a few questions.

496
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,380
At a residence?

497
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:24,384
I see. I'll let him know
once I get in touch with him.

498
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,878
Yes, please do that. Thank you.

499
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,587
Yes. Bye.

500
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,060
-Give that to me.
-My gosh.

501
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:41,227
-Give it to me.
-I almost died. Knock before you come.

502
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,653
Knock, knock. Give that to me.

503
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,283
Here.

504
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:58,162
Gosh, that's the engineering major.

505
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:01,628
The goddess of engineering.

506
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:04,746
-Su-bok.
-What?

507
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:08,221
Before you came here, you were

508
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,759
a part of a detective division, right?

509
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,182
Yes, I was.

510
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:16,060
In that case,
when a detective suddenly goes AWOL,

511
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,520
what do you reckon is happening?

512
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,520
Why do you ask?

513
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:23,692
Do you remember that guy
who came after killing those cats?

514
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,362
The guy who shot his gun at us.

515
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,651
-The BB gun?
-Yes.

516
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:30,654
Two people went missing
from the residence he lives in.

517
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,368
And the detective
who went to see one of those two

518
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:36,869
suddenly went out of touch.
Isn't this weird?

519
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,461
That could be nothing.

520
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,921
-Come on.
-When a detective is in his zone,

521
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,416
he can go off the grid

522
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,915
until the day he resolved that case.

523
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:54,180
He'd suddenly come back in a few days,
looking completely fine.

524
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:57,806
No, it's really weird.

525
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,432
I have a gut feeling.

526
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:03,022
You have a gut feeling?
You're too new to have one.

527
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:06,863
Jeong-hwa, look.
A patrol division is a place

528
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:10,026
where we take initial measures,
not an investigative agency.

529
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:13,776
If you became an officer
to investigate, wake up.

530
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:17,414
Stop stepping out of your line.
Just do your job. Your duties.

531
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:20,405
-Su-bok.
-What?

532
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,536
-Do you have small bills in here?
-Why?

533
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,206
What?

534
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:29,514
You told me to do my job.
Thanks for paying me for the overtime.

535
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:32,878
Hey, why... Why did you take money
from me for your overtime? Hey.

536
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,093
I can get a new fan for 5,000 won!

537
00:42:35,177 --> 00:42:38,347
And I didn't become an officer
to investigate.

538
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:43,976
I just wanted to help people.
That's why I became one. Goodbye.

539
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:45,401
Goodbye.

540
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:47,146
My goodness.

541
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,069
Jong-u, aren't you going home?

542
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:56,115
-I--
-Why not? Your girlfriend is very pretty.

543
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:57,278
Go on a date with her.

544
00:42:57,366 --> 00:43:00,036
We're meeting on the weekend.
I'll do some more work before I leave.

545
00:43:00,953 --> 00:43:03,753
People might think
you're doing everyone's work.

546
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:07,381
Mr. Park, don't be so mean again.
Try to speak a little nicer.

547
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:08,499
Okay.

548
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,956
All right, let's go home.
Yu-jeong, so? Are we grabbing a drink?

549
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,377
No, I'm meeting someone. Please excuse me.

550
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:18,136
I'm eating out with my family too.
See you tomorrow.

551
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,637
Okay. You should spend your evening
with your family.

552
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,058
I'll drink alone tonight.

553
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:56,010
MINIMAL LIVING EXPENSE

554
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,471
PAY, 1.75 MILLION WON
250,000 WON EXTRA

555
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,761
No matter how much I try to save money,
I only have 250,000 won left per month.

556
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,268
Goodness.

557
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:09,229
When will I make enough to move?

558
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,491
Goodness.

559
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:22,490
Bo-min, when are we going to get
the sample poster and the storyboard?

560
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:23,946
The sample poster and the storyboard?

561
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:28,082
Early next month.
I'll share it as soon as I get it.

562
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,245
Okay.

563
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:32,803
We have to film that
when our actors are free.

564
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:35,257
We have to figure out the schedule.
Ji-eun?

565
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,009
Can you check the schedule
of each of our actors?

566
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:40,223
Ji-eun?

567
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,142
Ji-eun!

568
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,810
What's on your mind?

569
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:50,482
Hey. What's with you?

570
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:52,362
Check the actors' schedules.

571
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:53,769
Yes, okay.

572
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:56,938
Were you thinking about
what you'll eat for dinner?

573
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:57,987
Gosh.

574
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:02,907
She's pretty obsessed with food,
isn't she?

575
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,371
You heard me, right?

576
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,962
We have to film the storyboard,
so check the actors' schedules.

577
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:09,542
Yes, ma'am.

578
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:12,423
And we're going to grab
a quick drink tonight.

579
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:16,085
Right, you must be meeting your boyfriend.

580
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:18,631
No, I'm free tonight too.

581
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,719
Really? Then come with us.

582
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:21,721
Okay, sure.

583
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,892
You don't have to come if you're busy.

584
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:32,561
Well, so...

585
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,821
Doctor, we'll get going.

586
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:35,898
-Goodbye.
-Sure, goodbye.

587
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,823
-See you tomorrow.
-I'm sorry I caused such a nuisance.

588
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,242
-Sure. Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

589
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,780
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

590
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,775
I'm sorry to bother you, Dr. Seo.
You can't get off work because of me.

591
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,407
-I'm sorry.
-Don't worry.

592
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,623
You look very tired too.

593
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:50,754
A lot has been going on lately.

594
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,961
Someone is killing cats,
and there's a missing case too.

595
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:57,002
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't say these weird things.

596
00:45:57,087 --> 00:45:58,707
-It's okay. Take a seat.
-Yes.

597
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,014
Is someone continuously killing cats?

598
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,762
Yes, really.

599
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:07,216
Why is someone so mean to stray cats?

600
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:10,603
I once read from a book

601
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:16,023
that criminals usually start off
by killing animals.

602
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:19,230
It may not be just a prank.

603
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,485
Do you think so too?

604
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,914
Why? Do you have a suspect?

605
00:46:26,116 --> 00:46:28,946
I can't seem to put a finger on a person,

606
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:32,121
but there are a few people at a residence
that I'm suspicious of.

607
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:36,922
What am I saying? I'm sorry.

608
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,968
Gosh, I'm sorry.
I forgot to bring your chart.

609
00:46:43,634 --> 00:46:44,974
-One second.
-Sure.

610
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:26,473
-Yes, Su-bok.
-Hey, Jeong-hwa.

611
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:28,802
I have to get and watch
the backup of the security footage

612
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,177
from the intersection
of Eunhye Elementary School.

613
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,385
Can you get that for me?

614
00:47:33,475 --> 00:47:34,595
Right now?

615
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,055
Yes, it's an emergency. Where are you?

616
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,975
-I'm at the dentist.
-The dentist?

617
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:41,114
What a relief. You aren't that far.

618
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:42,475
What about Hyeon-ho?

619
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:45,148
He went far away on a family affair.

620
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:46,911
I'm sorry to ask you after work.

621
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:49,489
Yes, okay. Bye.

622
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:56,251
Dr. Seo, I'm sorry.
Something suddenly came up.

623
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,670
Gosh, you had to stay after your hours
because of me. I'm so sorry.

624
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:01,421
It's all right. You have a busy job.

625
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:02,923
I'm so sorry.

626
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,215
Do come right away if it hurts again.

627
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,799
Yes. Thank you, doctor.

628
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:09,093
-Sure. Goodbye.
-Yes. Goodbye.

629
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:29,567
It's still full.

630
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:05,151
His legs were like this.
They were thinner than mine, you know.

631
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:08,447
I really don't get it.

632
00:49:08,987 --> 00:49:13,117
But then... Ji-eun.
Just pick up if it's your boyfriend.

633
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:14,200
It's okay.

634
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:16,414
Just pick up. Don't let it keep ringing.

635
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:18,753
Oh, okay.

636
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:22,956
So whenever I go out...
I mean, of course...

637
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:28,973
Hey, Jong-u.

638
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:32,677
Yes. Are you working overtime again?

639
00:49:33,428 --> 00:49:35,008
Yes, what about you?

640
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:40,686
I'm at a company dinner.
My boss wants to hang out a little.

641
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,227
I see.

642
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:47,362
What's with that voice?
Did something happen?

643
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:51,152
What is it? Tell me.

644
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,239
What is this?
Are they talking behind my back?

645
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,528
What?

646
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:59,079
No, it's nothing. What were you saying?

647
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:05,996
Well, Ji-eun.

648
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,340
It's the residence that I'm staying at.

649
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,928
People here are really strange.

650
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:16,598
One of them stutters and laughs at me,

651
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:19,520
and another one suddenly swears
at me for no reason.

652
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:24,231
And I'm not sure who it is,
but someone's keep coming into my room.

653
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:29,395
There can't be a lot of normal people

654
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:31,614
who live in that residence.

655
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:36,449
Only you'll get tired if you get concerned
about what those weird people do.

656
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:41,405
And you need to stand up for yourself
at work from what I've seen today.

657
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,130
You know what?

658
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,090
When people say you're nice,
it's not a compliment. It's an insult.

659
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:51,422
Yes, okay.

660
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,220
I'm sorry. That was too much.

661
00:50:58,597 --> 00:51:00,057
No, you're right.

662
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:03,889
I must've been overly sensitive.

663
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:07,024
You should go back inside.
They must be waiting.

664
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,478
You aren't sulking, are you?

665
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:12,188
No way. I'm not sulking.

666
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,777
Okay. I'll text you when I go home.

667
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:17,695
Okay.

668
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:36,089
-Young man. Are you coming in just now?
-Yes.

669
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,049
-Come in here for a second.
-What?

670
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:39,216
Come in for a second.

671
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,270
-Come in.
-Why?

672
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,982
-Gosh, look at how much you're sweating.
-Please.

673
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:51,153
You need to take a shower.
Drink this. It's cold.

674
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,567
-Anyway, what is it?
-Right.

675
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:58,913
I had a question. Drink up.

676
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,242
-Isn't it good?
-What's going on?

677
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:06,714
-I saw you this morning...
-Yes?

678
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,590
...with that officer lady.
Did you tell her anything?

679
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,131
Oh, this morning?

680
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:17,835
Did you tell her something bad?

681
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,221
Something bad?

682
00:52:20,011 --> 00:52:21,811
It's because you know,

683
00:52:22,138 --> 00:52:25,638
people moved out of here all of a sudden,

684
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:27,685
-but I need to make a living.
-Right.

685
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:30,809
If any bad rumors go around,
I can't really run my business.

686
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:31,817
Yes, right.

687
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,775
-Do you understand what I'm saying?
-Yes.

688
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,412
-Then I'll get going.
-Sure.

689
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,368
Sure. Give that to me.

690
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:42,621
You must have bought something.

691
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:44,661
-Go to the shower and wash up.
-Yes.

692
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,218
How's the guy in room 303?

693
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,774
Goodness, this isn't the first time
I had to do this.

694
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:13,191
The drug will kick in soon enough.

695
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:14,653
You have nothing to worry about.

696
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:21,658
So will you start working
on room 303 tonight?

697
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:28,197
-That looks good. Keep up the good work.
-Yes.

698
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,538
Right.

699
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,668
-Ms. Um.
-Yes?

700
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:41,675
-Why did you do that?
-Do what?

701
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,721
The woman on the fourth floor.

702
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:48,642
Why?

703
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,649
Are you going to kill me too
for doing that on my own?

704
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:07,579
No way.

705
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:11,157
You're special.

706
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:18,508
Try staying locked up in this place.

707
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:20,918
You get a bad itch.

708
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:25,716
Yes. I trust you.

709
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:28,719
Keep it up.

710
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,895
I need to add a lot of MSG.

711
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,657
This is weird.

712
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:53,115
Why do I always get a headache
whenever I'm back here?

713
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:58,131
Man, I feel like throwing up.

714
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:30,790
Stop showing off just because
you're friends with the CEO. Okay?

715
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,499
Stop showing off, you jerk!

716
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:34,289
And stop calling me Jae-ho, okay?

717
00:55:34,372 --> 00:55:36,712
This is exactly
why you can't control your emotions.

718
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:40,551
It must be your thing to get
people's sympathy with that pretty face.

719
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:43,668
But no, it won't work for me.

720
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:48,087
Is... Is something funny going on,
Deuk-su?

721
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:51,008
Do you want me to kill you already?
Should I kill him or not?

722
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:54,061
Should I kill him or not?

723
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:58,102
Should I kill him or not?

724
00:55:58,605 --> 00:55:59,975
Just quit, you idiot!

725
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,395
Do you want me to kill you already?

726
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:06,034
How do you want me to kill you? Babe.

727
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:10,985
There can't be a lot of normal people
who live in that residence.

728
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,576
Just quit, you idiot!

729
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,040
-You'll get tired if you get concerned...
-Should I kill him or not?

730
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:17,251
-about what those weird people do.
-Should I kill him or not?

731
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:20,342
-Should I kill him or not?
-And you need to stand up for yourself

732
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:22,588
-at work from what I've seen today.
-Should I kill him or not?

733
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:25,922
It must be your thing
to get people's sympathy

734
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:28,007
-with that pretty face.
-Not a compliment. It's an insult.

735
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,933
-But no, it won't work for me.
-You know what?

736
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:33,892
-It's not a compliment. It's an insult.
-Should I kill him or not?

737
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:36,272
-You know what?
-Should I kill him or not?

738
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,941
-Should I kill him or not?
-When people say you're nice,

739
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:42,320
it's not a compliment. It's an insult.

740
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:06,013
Did I get sick
from eating something wrong today?

741
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,009
I'm awfully tired.

742
00:57:15,765 --> 00:57:18,305
Did something happen today
that bothers me?

743
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:39,206
Did I take some weird drug?
What's wrong with my body?

744
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:50,721
What is this?

745
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,221
What's going on all of a sudden?

746
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:54,239
-Ms. Um, I think someone was in my room.
-Goodness.

747
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,372
Hey, man. Come out. Come on out!

748
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:59,239
He seems kind of odd
ever since he came to Seoul.

749
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:00,867
Is something going on at the residence?

750
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:04,254
Did anything else happen that you thought
was weird at the residence?

751
00:59:04,332 --> 00:59:05,382
Ji-eun.

752
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:07,457
I just heard something in here.

753
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,804
No one lives on the fourth floor
after the fire.

754
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:13,299
You don't think you fit in here, do you?

755
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:17,473
The young man in room 303 seems
to meet that police officer often.

756
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:18,684
Are you all right?

757
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:24,016
