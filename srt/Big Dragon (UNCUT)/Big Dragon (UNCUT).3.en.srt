Delete every video clip,

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,710
or you'll get in trouble.

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:11,480
How was it?

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,250
Did you like my little dragon?

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,910
Could you...

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:16,400
spy on Mangkorn...

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,130
and...

9
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:18,630
steal his phone for me?

10
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,230
Hey.

11
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,570
How did you get here?

12
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:22,180
Did you spy on me?

13
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,160
Ouch!

14
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:23,930
That hurts.

15
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:24,740
What's wrong with you today?

16
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:26,000
You're sad?

17
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,070
I'm a little bummed today.

18
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,070
Please excuse me.

19
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,190
Yai.

20
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,790
You just got here?

21
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:55,560
Yeah.

22
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,890
C'mon, let's go to our seats.

23
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,430
You want anything? I'll order it for you.

24
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,360
Just a cocktail, please.

25
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,360
Okay, wait here.

26
00:01:09,610 --> 00:01:12,539
There are so many factors

27
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:15,230
that cause déja-vus.

28
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:17,650
Dreams.

29
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:20,660
Familiarities.

30
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,900
The mulfuntional brain.

31
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,900
Or similar experiences that might happen before.

32
00:01:27,910 --> 00:01:30,680
But what does exactly...

33
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,680
make me feel this way towards Mangkorn?

34
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:37,440
Mangkorn.

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,440
Where are you going afterwards?

36
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,970
Are you gonna go sleep at your place?

37
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,420
Or...

38
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:49,540
here?

39
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:53,540
And where would you like me to sleep?

40
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,440
Well,...

41
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,440
in our room.

42
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,510
Just kidding.

43
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:10,510
In case you're free, we're gonna go drink at another bar.

44
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,730
Then...

45
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:16,140
I guess not.

46
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,790
I'll be drinking by the pool.

47
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:22,430
If you, ladies, would like to join,

48
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,430
feel free to do so.

49
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,760
I'm off now.

50
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,720
Mangkorn,

51
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
you're gonna walk with your balls hanging!

52
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,970
What are you doing?

53
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,290
Nothing.

54
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,710
Nothing?

55
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,710
You have my bag.

56
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,170
Where is my underwear?

57
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,830
Are you a psycho?

58
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,270
Stealing other people's underwear?

59
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:33,620
Why are you smiling?

60
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:35,620
You want me to leak the videos?

61
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,640
Why do you think I got your bag for?

62
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:45,870
I...

63
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,880
took your bag...

64
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,880
to delete our story that night.

65
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:56,300
You wanna leak the videos?

66
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,590
Be my guest.

67
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,320
Leak them.

68
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,530
Just go ahead.

69
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,590
Because I just stomped on your phone.

70
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,440
And I rinsed it with water.

71
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,490
Oh.

72
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,010
Then...

73
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,260
It must have be broken.

74
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,260
What a shame!

75
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:27,140
You said I could spread the videos anywhere, right?

76
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,600
You think I'm stupid?

77
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,600
To keep them in one place?

78
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:46,280
You are...

79
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:48,810
so you.

80
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,220
You and your evil plans...

81
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,220
but not really careful.

82
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:00,660
Then...

83
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,830
shall we reminisce that night?

84
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:14,490
That night...

85
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,420
I'm sorry.

86
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,510
Huh.

87
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,480
Sorry?

88
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:42,630
Come here.

89
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,870
So?

90
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,440
Consent?

91
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,780
If you do,

92
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,780
sit down.

93
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,190
Sit!

94
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,440
Sit down!

95
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,250
Call be "boss".

96
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,630
And you are my "employee".

97
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:40,980
Yes, Boss.

98
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:42,919
Is there anything I could do...

99
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:46,920
Hush! Who said you could talk?

100
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,080
If you don't want to be known as a psycho,

101
00:08:56,350 --> 00:09:00,350
you must give me pleasure.

102
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
Close your eyes.

103
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,860
I told you to close your eyes.

104
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,150
Open your mouth.

105
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:21,240
Do what you've done before.

106
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,720
You're really going for it?

107
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,700
Are you teasing me?

108
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:57,030
You're so easy to fool.

109
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Yeah, wait here.

110
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,570
I'll go change.

111
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:51,860
Why did you bring me here?

112
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,750
I just wanna chill.

113
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,750
So many people in the party.

114
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,160
When I was in high school, I liked to come here.

115
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:15,380
When I was sad...

116
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:18,940
when I was troubled...

117
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:20,440
or when I was upset.

118
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,730
You? Sad?

119
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,300
What the hell are you smiling for?

120
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,740
You were mad at me earlier.

121
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,740
And teased me.

122
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:49,000
Aww, wasn't that embarrasing?

123
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Stop it!

124
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,400
When are you going to delete the videos?

125
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,470
Let me ask you, what do you want?

126
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,080
Money?

127
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,170
Girls?

128
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,970
Just tell me, I can give you all of them.

129
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,950
No.

130
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,950
I have to do my internship anyway.

131
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:15,770
You could just be my friend for a while.

132
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,290
Friend?

133
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,290
A guy like you wants to be friends with me?

134
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,990
Mmm.

135
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:30,080
When I'm done with my internship,

136
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,080
I'll delete the videos, okay?

137
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:39,100
Alright.

138
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,320
But I, do not want to be your friend.

139
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,490
W-what?

140
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:54,490
But that night, you and I got along pretty well, right?

141
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,030
Why do you always make that face?

142
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:00,800
My face is like this.

143
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,770
There!

144
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:04,770
And your personality.

145
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,770
They really freakin' get on my nerves.

146
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:12,150
But I really want to be your friend.

147
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,680
I don't know how to make friends.

148
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,780
But with girls, you have no problems with that.

149
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:22,110
It's not the same.

150
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:29,030
But I'm only like this...with you.

151
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,510
Bullshit.

152
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:39,650
Anyway,

153
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:41,580
You and I,

154
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:44,580
are just acquaintances, that's all.

155
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:51,910
Hey!

156
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,260
What the hell are you doing?

157
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,360
Did you get drunk at the party?

158
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,900
No.

159
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Here you go.

160
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,010
Oops!

161
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,780
I bumped into someone at the party.

162
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,490
Here.

163
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,720
You're not taking it?

164
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,350
Or you wanna take mine?

165
00:14:57,350 --> 00:14:58,080
I'm taking it off.

166
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:02,080
Hey, that's no need.

167
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,990
Damn it.

168
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:16,150
Hey, turn around.

169
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,450
Don't peek.

170
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:22,100
What are you shy about?

171
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,220
I've seen it all.

172
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:51,670
It is so dark here.

173
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So dark that you can see the moon.

174
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,020
I never know that...

175
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:02,020
there's a place like this by the airport.

176
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:08,560
This is my favorite spot.

177
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,730
Do you know...

178
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,100
here, you can see the moon during the night.

179
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,880
And you can also see the sunrise at dawn.

180
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,840
It's very beautiful.

181
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,530
There was one time...

182
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,980
I failed my admission exam to a uni.

183
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,980
It was my family's expectation.

184
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,610
So I came here just to sit like a fool.

185
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:42,140
Listening to the wind...

186
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,840
looking at the planes flying...

187
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,660
and I made a wish to the moon.

188
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:56,350
What did you wish for?

189
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,600
I wished for myself...

190
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,740
to be in a good place.

191
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:06,740
To meet good people.

192
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:11,670
And suddenly there was a group of fireflies flying by.

193
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,900
I don't know if...

194
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,060
it's a coincidence or it's a natural thing.

195
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:22,060
Or if it's magical...

196
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,609
All I know is...

197
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:30,610
fireflies are the representative of people like me.

198
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,310
And there are lots of people out there too.

199
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:39,310
Where are the fireflies?

200
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,730
I don't see one.

201
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,730
There. In the mangrove forest.

202
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,420
Maybe...

203
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,350
the day that fireflies fly here again,

204
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,920
you and I might become friends already.

205
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,300
Here.

206
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:44,130
Let me tell you that this is the best.

207
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,530
The original sweet noodle dessert.

208
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:51,340
How good it was before 40 years ago,

209
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,340
it's still as good now.

210
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,710
Try it.

211
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,640
How's it?

212
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,640
Oh, it's tasty.

213
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:15,170
Next time, buy me and bring it to the bar.

214
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:21,460
I thought your bar is already closed.

215
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:25,750
Well, you'd better hurry up and make it reopen soon.

216
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,120
Those two are so adorable.

217
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:49,190
I can't imagine how they grow old together.

218
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,950
Can't two men love each other?

219
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,190
That's not what I meant.

220
00:19:55,190 --> 00:19:58,100
I mean...

221
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:02,200
no matter how much they love each other,

222
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,200
they don't have a chance to sign a marriage certificate.

223
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,360
Well, that's true.

224
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,330
Though love doesn't have limitations now,

225
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:23,330
eventually, it's forbidden by the law.

226
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,300
Well, it's really hard to talk about love.

227
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,440
Though you get married,

228
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:39,970
it doesn't mean that you'll live together forever.

229
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,950
That's true.

230
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:46,950
Last year, there are ten of thousands of divorced couples in Bangkok.

231
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,200
How did you know?

232
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,170
News from the internet.

233
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:53,140
Do you only use the internat just to chat with girls?

234
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,250
There! You're doing it again.

235
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,910
Just eat.

236
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:01,990
Or else I'll eat yours.

237
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:03,880
How could you?

238
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,010
If you wanna eat it, order more.

239
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,110
You don't know anything, do you?

240
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,830
Let me tell you something.

241
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:14,830
Don't you know that when we share food, it tastes better?

242
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,130
Let me have it.

243
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,620
Hey!

244
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,310
Just eat yours.

245
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,960
Well, I wanna eat yours.

246
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,740
Then I'll eat yours.

247
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,000
Hey, don't!

248
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:25,970
Don't!

249
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:26,820
Stop it!

250
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,230
I'll eat yours.

251
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,120
Go ahead, I'll eat yours.

252
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,090
I'll take the whole thing.

253
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:33,500
Yeah, take it, I'll eat this.

254
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,840
Oh, so good.

255
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:36,970
Very very good.

256
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,970
Why does yours taste better than mine?

257
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,740
And...your car that's parked at the party,
what are you gonna do with it?

258
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:03,280
It's alright.

259
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,280
I'll have Park and Pong handle it.

260
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:12,020
Oh. Ouch.

261
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,590
Is it still hurting?

262
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,680
Yeah.

263
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,200
A little bit.

264
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,200
It comes and goes.

265
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,610
Hey.

266
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:26,110
Stay still, I'll do it for you.

267
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,450
You weren't full earlier?

268
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,300
No.

269
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,300
I haven't eaten anything all day.

270
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:09,110
Then...wait here.

271
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:12,500
I'll grab you something to eat.

272
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,080
Hey, it's alright.

273
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,570
The rain is falling hard.

274
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:17,860
You'll get sick.

275
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,860
That's fine. Just wait here.

276
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,440
Hello, Park, Pong.

277
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:49,000
Mr. Yai! Where have you been, Mr. Yai?

278
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,680
It's almost midnight now.

279
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,660
Do you know how much we both are worried about you?

280
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,540
Right. At least, answer your phone!

281
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,230
So we'll know that you're safe.

282
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:59,280
Mmm.

283
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:03,280
I'm sorry for making you worry.

284
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,460
Can you do me a favor?

285
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,870
I parked my car at a party.

286
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:14,720
Can you handle that?

287
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:18,950
I'll send you the location.

288
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:20,510
Er...yes.

289
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,120
And where are you, Mr. Yai?

290
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,120
I'm in front of my place now. Don't worry.

291
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,210
Please take care of it for me.

292
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,390
Are you alright?

293
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:45,390
Yeah.

294
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,730
You want me to walk you to your room?

295
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:50,980
Hey...

296
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:55,010
You're looking for a chance to get into my room?

297
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,900
Just a sip.

298
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,900
I'm alright, really.

299
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:10,520
About your phone that I broke...

300
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:13,600
I'll buy a new one for you.

301
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,820
Hey, it's alright.

302
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:19,750
I'm thinking about changing it anyway.

303
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:23,640
No. I was the one who broke it.

304
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,640
I must take my responsibility.

305
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:31,280
So where is it? The food.

306
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,300
Duck noodles.

307
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,700
I don't know if you'll like it or not.

308
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,320
But just have it.

309
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,110
Mmm.

310
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,030
Mangkorn.

311
00:25:58,040 --> 00:26:00,040
Thanks for the ride.

312
00:26:02,410 --> 00:26:03,410
And...

313
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:06,260
for this too.

314
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,960
Mmm.

315
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:13,810
You're welcome.

316
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,090
Drive safely.

317
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,820
I will.

318
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,040
See ya.

319
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:49,730
"Get well soon :)"

320
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:54,810
What? So old-fashioned.

321
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:13,620
I don't know how two guys...

322
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:17,310
who started off by hating each other...

323
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:19,310
will continue their relationship.

324
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:07,220
You haven't texted me lately.

325
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:09,220
Got a girlfiend already?

326
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:13,350
I miss you, Da.

327
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,540
Don't change the subject.

328
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,540
You got a girlfriend?

329
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:25,950
No, I don't like getting tied up with anyone.

330
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,160
Really?

331
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:37,370
Normally, I see you like tieing up.

332
00:29:47,690 --> 00:29:50,550
That's enough, Da.

333
00:29:50,550 --> 00:29:52,550
I'm not in the mood for it.

334
00:29:57,030 --> 00:29:59,720
If you're gonna invite me and not do this,
don't do it next time.

335
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,720
It's a waste of time.

336
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,200
Are you alright?

337
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:21,180
Do you think...

338
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:25,180
a guy can date a guy?

339
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:31,430
Why are you asking?

340
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,010
Of course.

341
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:42,010
Take a look at me. When I like someone,
I don't care about sexuality.

342
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,550
I think you should spend some time alone.

343
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,160
So you can think straight.

344
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,130
I think I'd better leave.

345
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,100
You want a ride?

346
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,100
It's alright, I got this.

347
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,190
I'm sorry.

348
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,190
I've been concerned about the bar recently.

349
00:31:11,810 --> 00:31:16,090
Oh, I gotta go back to Phuket.

350
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:19,750
I need to help my family business.

351
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:22,160
You'll be alright, right, Yai?

352
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:26,000
Actually, we don't have any commitment.

353
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,730
Mmm. I'll be alright.

354
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,730
Take a good care of yourself.

355
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,220
I'm off.

356
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:39,120
Do you want me to go downstairs with you?

357
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,510
It's alright. I'll see you.

358
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,140
Okay, see you.

359
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:15,060
"Have you gotten a new phone?"

360
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,340
So, Park?

361
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,000
Mr. Yai is still not answering his phone?

362
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,840
Right.

363
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,840
I think he's still mad at us.

364
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:02,020
Definitely.

365
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,740
But it's alright.

366
00:33:03,740 --> 00:33:07,740
Because today, we'll definitely get the phone.

367
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,000
Is it a good idea?

368
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Yeah.

369
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,159
What's that?

370
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,050
Hey, Mangkorn.

371
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,690
It's so late, why are you still here?

372
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:52,090
Er...I'd like to finish my work first.

373
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,460
Well, I see you as a new kiddo here.

374
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,550
I don't wanna scare you.

375
00:34:55,550 --> 00:34:56,550
Yes.

376
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,730
You see.

377
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:04,730
There's no one in our company working this late.

378
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:07,830
Because everyone knows.

379
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:11,030
This place used to be a cemetary.

380
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,850
In the past, there was an auntie maid here.

381
00:35:12,850 --> 00:35:15,140
She worked here to pay her child's school fees.

382
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:18,790
And then she had a heart attack and died.

383
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:21,430
And this is a Buddhist day.

384
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:23,430
It's very haunting.

385
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,580
It's alright.

386
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,020
I'm not afraid of ghosts.

387
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,020
But I am!

388
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,550
Good luck, kiddo.

389
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,550
Oh, Mr. Rat, goodbye.

390
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,550
Be quiet.

391
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:56,190
Hey, how's that happening?

392
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,980
I must call security.

393
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,030
Park, have you found it?

394
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,400
C'mon, hurry up.

395
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,400
Let's go.

396
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,140
Let's go, damn it.

397
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:05,630
Where to? C'mon, we gotta find it so we can leave.

398
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,920
Quit playing around, Park.

399
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,920
I'm not playing.

400
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,620
Are they your friends?

401
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,430
No.

402
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,680
Theives?

403
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,720
Theives.

404
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:33,720
Oh.

405
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,260
Eat a lot, okay?

406
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,550
So you'll grow up fast.

407
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:45,550
And you'll be beautiful.

408
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:49,690
Park.

409
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,690
Hey.

410
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,420
Park.

411
00:37:54,430 --> 00:37:55,430
Park!

412
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,680
Damn it, Park!

413
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:02,090
Are you alright?

414
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,090
Yeah.

415
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:09,700
"Here comes your daily horoscope!"

416
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:15,590
Pong.

417
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,360
Huh?

418
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:21,360
My horoscope today, it says I won't be able to keep a secret.

419
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,100
And you believe that?

420
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,460
Yeah, of course.

421
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:27,460
I met a real ghost.

422
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,150
Do you think...

423
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:36,550
we should tell Mr. Yai about what happened that night?

424
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:49,480
SUNRISE BAR 1 P.M. WITH G DESIGN

425
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,810
Are you crazy?

426
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:51,660
You wanna die?

427
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,350
And we're gonna keeping it a secret like this?

428
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:54,480
How many weeks have you kept it?

429
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,330
See.

430
00:38:55,330 --> 00:38:56,380
Can't you keep it longer?

431
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,030
Well...

432
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,480
You'll get me in trouble too.

433
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,960
I'm frustrated.

434
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,570
Because now...

435
00:39:02,570 --> 00:39:03,740
I can't take it anymore!

436
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,330
Hey!

437
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:13,990
I must tell Mr. Yai!

438
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,150
Hey!

439
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,480
You know I'm not good at lying.

440
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,440
If I tell him, I'll be relieved.

441
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,190
Give it here!

442
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:22,920
Give it back!

443
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:23,830
No!

444
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,780
Shit!

445
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:41,750
Hello.

446
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:44,470
Hello?

447
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,920
Get it.

448
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,840
Damn.

449
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,370
My phone.

450
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,370
Awww, my babies.

451
00:39:58,090 --> 00:39:59,150
You!

452
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,150
No, you!

453
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:01,860
Buy a new phone for me.

454
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,260
Here, Mr. Yai.

455
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,670
Two new phones that you wanted us to buy for you.

456
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:13,670
Oh, thank you so much, Pong.

457
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:19,230
Here. Take it.

458
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:22,360
Oh, thank you very much, Mr. Yai.

459
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,360
I heard your phone broke.

460
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:29,730
And...how about the other one?

461
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,650
I'll use it myself.

462
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,310
Hello, Mr. Yai.

463
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,190
Hello, Mr. Rat.

464
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,460
How are things? Is everything alright?

465
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:49,870
Oh, we're measuring the size of the parts of the building.

466
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:52,110
Would you like anything else, Mr. Yai?

467
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:55,680
Mmm, actually, just do as briefed.

468
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,640
But I'd like to add on something that's different than before.

469
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:02,690
But I also want to keep the luxury...

470
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:05,860
and the classic style like the old bar.

471
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,460
Certainly, no problem.

472
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,190
Please excuse me, I'll see what they're doing over there.

473
00:41:10,190 --> 00:41:12,190
If you'd like anything,

474
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,390
please ask Fai here.

475
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,390
Of course.

476
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,330
Excuse me.

477
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:28,570
An intern named Mangkorn...

478
00:41:28,570 --> 00:41:29,890
he's not here?

479
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:33,890
Oh, he's off work today.
I heard that he's going back to his hometown.

480
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:39,860
Did he call?

481
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,860
Yes, he called this morning.

482
00:41:45,750 --> 00:41:47,750
He called by phone?

483
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:51,030
He called by telepath, maybe?

484
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,460
Excuse me.

485
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,050
Please.

486
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,640
Here, have it.

487
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,820
So you'll use it as a pair.

488
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,820
I thought you said you're gonna use it yourself.

489
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:11,980
No. I can still use my current one.

490
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,800
Isn't it good though?
You'll get to have the same phones.

491
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:18,960
Yes, sir.

492
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:24,520
I'm off. I'm sleepy.

493
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,570
Oh...how about...

494
00:42:25,570 --> 00:42:27,460
Where are you going, Mr. Yai?

495
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:28,340
Please watch them for me.

496
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:29,580
Yes, sir.

497
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,340
Can you?

498
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,320
And see if everything's going well, okay?

499
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,320
Oh, alright, yes, sir.

500
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,430
You can switch if you like this color.

501
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:45,870
Alright, now that we are all here together.

502
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,390
I've got good news.

503
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,950
For both of our families.

504
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:51,640
And that is...

505
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,050
is...

506
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:57,050
Ta-da...

507
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:02,970
Hong and Mangkorn's engagement ceremony!

508
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,800
Surprise!

509
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,160
Are you surprised?

510
00:43:42,350 --> 00:43:43,600
Well,...

511
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,210
you just got new phones.

512
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:47,780
Now you got couple cases as well?

513
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,300
So adorable.

514
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,550
Er...Mr. Yai, that's messed up.

515
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,320
It's all nonsense.

516
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:00,490
Hey, who's calling?

517
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:06,360
It's an unknown number.

518
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:07,820
Answer it.

519
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:12,070
Don't forget to put it on a speaker.

520
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:17,120
Greetings. This is a call from Customs Department.

521
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,210
You have a unpaid package on hold.

522
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:22,210
Please press 9 to proceed.

523
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:25,670
Press 9. Press 9.

524
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:26,600
Hey.

525
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,240
He should hang up.

526
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,880
Don't you know a scammer?

527
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:31,160
Right.

528
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,090
Or we'll be scammed...

529
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,230
Scammers!

530
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:35,560
They're everywhere.

531
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,560
They need to be caught.

532
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:41,750
Hey.

533
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:45,230
They're calling again.

534
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:46,730
I'm not answering that.

535
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,000
Hong and Mangkorn's engagement ceremony!

536
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:02,140
Do you think what my Pa's done is the right thing, Mangkorn?

537
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:05,130
Why didn't Mangkorn text me anything?

538
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,260
What is Mangkorn to you?

539
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,260
This is Yai, who came to help me with my thesis.

540
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:14,590
Nine, you never told me you'd come back to Thailand.
