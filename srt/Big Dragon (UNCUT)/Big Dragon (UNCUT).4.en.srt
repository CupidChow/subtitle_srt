2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,440
Mr. Yai is still not answering his phone?

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,200
We'll definitely get the phone.

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,330
You and I,

5
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,410
are just acquaintances, that's all.

6
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:14,170
Why did you bring me here?

7
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,000
But I really want to be your friend.

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,370
I don't know how to make friends.

9
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,730
An intern named Mangkorn...

10
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:20,900
he's not here?

11
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,940
Hello, yes?

12
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:22,870
A special present...

13
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:26,870
Hong and Mangkorn's engagement ceremony!

14
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:29,920
Surprise!

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,200
"Let me know when you arrive."

16
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:05,129
"Drive safely."

17
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,590
Let's eat. It's all fresh.

18
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,480
Here, the lobsters.

19
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,079
Hong and Mangkorn's favorite!

20
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:20,230
Hey, don't forget to peel it for her.

21
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:22,470
Actually,

22
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,120
we haven't been altogether like this in a long time,

23
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,550
since these two were little.

24
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,860
Right, they were running and playing there.

25
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:35,590
Yeah, and now they're all grown up.

26
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,550
That's right.

27
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:41,550
I heard that you got some kind of an international reward, huh?

28
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,760
From France, right?

29
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,840
Yeah, of course, he's good.

30
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,120
Unlike Milin,

31
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,320
I sent her to have extra class.

32
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,640
Yet, she still failed her exams.

33
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,600
Don't know if she's heartbroken...

34
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,640
Hey, just let them be, let them learn.

35
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,610
Like this Mangkorn here,...

36
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,090
he's been learning with Hong since they were little.

37
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,660
That's right, that's right.

38
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:06,250
And, I'm waiting for them to get married.

39
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,760
I really can't wait any longer.

40
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,960
Normally, they say it's match made in heaven.

41
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,260
But this, Mangkorn (Dragon) and Hong (Phoenix)...

42
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,570
Just their names are meant for each other.

43
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:17,370
That's absolutely right.

44
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,040
This couple, they're the best match.

45
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,530
No one's going to beat them.

46
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:21,530
They're the perfect match.

47
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,530
C'mon, let's clap our hands.

48
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:41,490
So the reason you had me drive for hundreds of kilometres,

49
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,490
is just to listen to all this stuff?

50
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:12,090
Why are you being sad here all by yourself?

51
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,720
Still like playing that?

52
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,130
You're a grown up now.

53
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,060
I didn't plan to buy it.

54
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:26,060
I walked pass by and helped buy some.

55
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,570
Actually, I kinda miss this place.

56
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,120
Time flies.

57
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:45,440
I still remember when we were playing around here.

58
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,120
Go! Go! Mangkorn, don't fall!

59
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,120
Back then...

60
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:00,840
we were happier than we are now, weren't we?

61
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,800
Eventually,

62
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,800
the day has come.

63
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,470
I've been keeping it to myself for so long.

64
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,970
Oh, I heard that...

65
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:40,780
you're gonna go work in Bangkok?

66
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,430
Well, yes.

67
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,550
I think I'm gonna look for a job there.

68
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:48,270
But honestly, I'd rather go abroad.

69
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,270
Living like this won't make me rich.

70
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:55,590
I suppose.

71
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,120
But...

72
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,730
if there's anything I can do to help, let me know.

73
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,890
Can I ask you for money?

74
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:05,890
Except for that.

75
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,960
Anyway, now that we're here,

76
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,960
why don't we play like we used to when we were little?

77
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,450
C'mon, let's go.

78
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:26,810
No.

79
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:28,690
There's no wind.

80
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:31,050
How can you fly a kite?

81
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,050
C'mon, sometimes, if you don't try, you won't know if it works.

82
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,870
Hurry up.

83
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:42,240
I'm not asking again.

84
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,630
Do you know how to do it?

85
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:46,630
Well, it's been a while.

86
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:50,540
How do I put it together?

87
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,020
Let me see.

88
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,500
Like this?

89
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,500
It's just like when we were kids.

90
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,820
Hey.

91
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:52,070
What brings you back home?

92
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:55,770
Isn't it the last place you wanna come to?

93
00:07:55,770 --> 00:07:58,210
Isn't it the same to you?

94
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:00,200
Normally, I see you have the shifts.

95
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,290
Today, you're home.

96
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,050
Looks like it's going to rain.

97
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:09,050
Oh, wow, you talk back now.

98
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:13,570
So, have you eaten?

99
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,460
Yeah.

100
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,500
Where is Dad?

101
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,070
Business talk.

102
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:23,110
At this time?

103
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:26,030
Yeah.

104
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,430
Have a seat.

105
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:30,480
I have something to talk to you.

106
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,780
Here?

107
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:36,020
Yeah, it's chilling. The atmosphere is nice.

108
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,659
C'mon, sit down.

109
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,740
So, what's up, Ying?

110
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,620
Mmm...

111
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,620
You know that Dad is seeing Auntie Li, right?

112
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,860
Our house is so quiet.

113
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:09,860
Don't you think?

114
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,310
When there's no one around,

115
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,430
when you're not around,

116
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,150
when Dad's not around.

117
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:34,150
And also Mom.

118
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,120
Mmm...

119
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,120
The world keeps moving, you know.

120
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,880
Do you miss Mom?

121
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,850
Of course.

122
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:03,850
Why are you asking?

123
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:09,450
Do you think Dad misses her too?

124
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:15,760
Well...I think so.

125
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:24,120
If he does, why did he bring an outsider into our family?

126
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,120
People...live in the present.

127
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,360
You can't think of the dead ones forever.

128
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:44,360
Don't you feel sorry for Dad?

129
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,810
We should care most for the feeling of those

130
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,810
who are still alive.

131
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:07,130
Well...

132
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,880
I still don't like this whole idea.

133
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,840
Mmm...

134
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,840
That's up to you.

135
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,020
Anyway, there's some porridge in the fridge.

136
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,110
If you're hungry, go have some.

137
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,790
Alright but it's fine.

138
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,790
I'll continue doing my work.

139
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,190
Damn.

140
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:03,830
Why hasn't Mangkorn replied any of my messages?

141
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,190
He must have been with girls.

142
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,790
I don't think it's like that.

143
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,500
If it's not, then why isn't he replying?

144
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,150
It's been five days.

145
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,440
And...

146
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:16,560
What is Mangkorn to you?

147
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,800
Why do you have to wait for his messages?

148
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,800
Well...

149
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:27,450
He's...

150
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:31,130
an intern at G Design.

151
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,130
Right?

152
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:37,280
Are you sure that he's just an intern?

153
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:40,120
Yeah.

154
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,880
Why don't you call him?

155
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,690
You can ask for his number from G Design.

156
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,460
That's true.

157
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,220
But no.

158
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:51,650
If he wants to talk, he'll call, right?

159
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:53,650
Why should I call first?

160
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:00,430
Anyway, I've been getting calls from unknown numbers.

161
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,500
They must be scammers for sure.

162
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:09,310
Or could it be Mangkorn?

163
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,310
I don't think so.

164
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:15,830
Have you finished working on accounting?

165
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:16,950
No.

166
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:20,670
I think I'm gonna go work outside.

167
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,180
And, where are you going, Pong?

168
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,660
I think I'm gonna go back to play games in my room.

169
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,460
And you, Park?

170
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:26,870
Oh...

171
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:31,110
I...will play games with Pong.

172
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:34,750
Why are you both playing games together?

173
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,230
Er...

174
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:41,030
Pong bought a new PlayStation.

175
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,000
So I thought I could join him.

176
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,680
Hey.

177
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,000
It's not what you think, Mr. Yai.

178
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,950
And you know what I'm thinking?

179
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,870
Er...Pong and I aren't a couple.

180
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,310
Hey!

181
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,590
What are you talking about?

182
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:56,350
Are you crazy?

183
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,150
I'm afraid Mr. Yai would think so.

184
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:02,150
Man, everyone has their pair.

185
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:09,440
You two, go play games.

186
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
I'll go work outside.

187
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,390
Certainly.

188
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,620
Thank you.

189
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:43,410
Hello.

190
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,770
Yes, Arjo?

191
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:49,040
Yai, I'm calling to announce good news.

192
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,880
The company that I wanted in, they've hired me.

193
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,630
Oh, really?

194
00:14:54,630 --> 00:14:56,070
Congratulations!

195
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:00,280
So I want to invite you, since you helped me with my thesis,...

196
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,120
to celebrate with me next week.

197
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,120
Are you free?

198
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,760
Er...

199
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,560
Hold on a sec...

200
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,560
I need to check my schedule.

201
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,790
"Do you wanna have a meal together this Friday after work?"

202
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:29,610
Er...the thing is my work at the company isn't finished yet.

203
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,160
Oh, really?

204
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,760
But I'd love to go.

205
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:36,330
Can I get back to you again?

206
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:38,530
Okay, of course.

207
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:42,450
I'll text you the detail, date and time for you, alright?

208
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:43,650
Yes, please.

209
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,150
See you.

210
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,820
Where the hell is he?

211
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:05,060
You've been home only for a week
and you're going back to Bangkok already?

212
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:09,060
I still miss you.

213
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:14,580
When you're free, come to Bangkok.

214
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:30,530
Are you upset about Hong?

215
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:39,660
There's no such thing like arranged marriage these days.

216
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,380
Those days are gone.

217
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:47,380
But your Pa and Hong's Pa...

218
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:51,380
Yok and I have been talking about this a lot that our heads hurt.

219
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:57,430
What should I do, Ma?

220
00:16:57,430 --> 00:17:00,020
You know...

221
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:04,020
Hong and I have been like siblings since we were little.

222
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,660
I'll try to talk to your Pa about this.

223
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:16,819
But I think if you talk to him...

224
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,819
he may listen to you.

225
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,030
Mangkorn.

226
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,860
I won't stop you from loving anyone.

227
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,240
Finally, they're going to get married!

228
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,290
They are a perfect match!

229
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,130
Drive safely, son.

230
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,010
Take care of her, would you?

231
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:56,010
Take a good care of her or I will pop to Bangkok!

232
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,950
Would you like anything else?

233
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:09,050
This one, please.

234
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,810
One moment. Please have a seat.

235
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:12,810
Alright, thank you.

236
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:17,230
So where are you heading next, Mangkorn?

237
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,230
Home, I guess. I haven't finished my work.

238
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,990
Hello, sir and ma'am.

239
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,980
We'll find a table for you.

240
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:40,490
No need to.

241
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:42,490
They may sit over there.

242
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:48,610
Thank you.

243
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,660
Please have a seat.

244
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,500
Let go!

245
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:32,710
Where are you off to?

246
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,710
Do you even care?

247
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,940
Why would you think that I don't?

248
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:45,470
If you did, you'd reply my Line messages.

249
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,500
You haven't replied for 7 days.

250
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,500
And you call this caring?

251
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:55,580
My old Line account didn't work anymore.

252
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,860
I called your number.

253
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,860
And you didn't answer.

254
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,250
You called me?

255
00:20:05,330 --> 00:20:06,330
Mmm.

256
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,620
I didn't know.

257
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,890
There are lots of scammers out there.

258
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:14,930
I don't answer to any unknown numbers.

259
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:17,250
Then don't complain.

260
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:21,250
I have to rejoin the group chat just for you.

261
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:28,300
I'm mad.

262
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,590
Then I'm mad too.

263
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:43,830
Give me your phone.

264
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,240
No!

265
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,240
Give me your phone.

266
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,040
Take it.

267
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,480
Here.

268
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,060
My new Line ID.

269
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:15,010
If you wanna talk to me,

270
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:17,450
just text me.

271
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:20,170
Who would wanna talk to you?

272
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:23,170
I've asked Park and Pong already.

273
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,970
You miss me, don't you?

274
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:31,970
Who said that?

275
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
And where are you going?

276
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:40,960
I'm not saying.

277
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,250
Are you sure?

278
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,600
Yes.

279
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:49,830
Go see your girlfriend.

280
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,830
At the café.

281
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:55,450
Who?

282
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,880
How would I know?

283
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,190
You mean Hong?

284
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,220
Yeah, Hong.

285
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,330
That one.

286
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:07,170
Go see her.

287
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:10,900
She's not my girlfriend.

288
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,850
She's my junior.

289
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:16,850
She just only took a ride with me to Bangkok.

290
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,260
Alright, then, I'm going home.

291
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,260
Yeah, that's good for you.

292
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,020
I'm off.

293
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,660
Hit me up on Line.

294
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,100
I'll be waiting to reply.

295
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,980
Jerk!

296
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:51,370
Jerk!

297
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:57,460
Jerk!

298
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,520
This is on you. You've been bragging.

299
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,800
I couldn't buy a skateboard for Mr. Yai in time.

300
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,520
What? Why are you blaming me?

301
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,810
All you did was playing games too.

302
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:25,210
Once we knew it, it was already 1:01 p.m.

303
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,720
How could we buy it in time?

304
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,670
It's limited edition.

305
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,790
I should have let the bot buy it.

306
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:37,790
Mr. Yai, why didn't you do it yourself, huh?

307
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,400
Pong. Park.

308
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,350
W-w...

309
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:46,670
Yes? Mangkorn.

310
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,820
Is there anything?

311
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,010
Oh, not really.

312
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:58,010
I just...wanna ask you something.

313
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,960
Isn't Mr. Yai here to check on the work today?

314
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,800
Mmm...Mr. Yai...

315
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,590
I don't think he's coming in today.

316
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,400
I guess he seems pretty bored.

317
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,400
Mmm...and...

318
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,990
where is Mr. Yai now?

319
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:19,990
Er...

320
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:14,170
How did you know that I was here?

321
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:17,410
Not telling ya.

322
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:26,010
Then why did you follow me here?

323
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:38,000
Alright, alright, I'm telling.

324
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,020
I asked Park.

325
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,430
Park?

326
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:45,940
Why did you have to ask him?

327
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:49,940
I wanted to see you.

328
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,940
Can I not?

329
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,940
My internship doesn't allow me much time.

330
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,380
And...

331
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:08,700
you still like skateboarding here?

332
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,700
Mmm.

333
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,980
It's like a safe zone for me...

334
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,980
when I'm upset or stressed out.

335
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,660
Your family, isn't it ?

336
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,940
Don't be confused...

337
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,940
about how I knew it.

338
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,660
But you know, people...

339
00:26:47,670 --> 00:26:50,670
can't always do what they want 100%

340
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:51,670
Trust me.

341
00:26:54,250 --> 00:27:00,660
Sometimes, a sacrifice needs to be made...

342
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:03,880
to make the people around you happy.

343
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:07,160
Especially,

344
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:09,160
family.

345
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,320
That's enough.

346
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,560
Stop being so dramatic.

347
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,880
You asked Park and Pong, didn't you?

348
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,770
I'm serious.

349
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,620
If we're gonna be friends,

350
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,620
we should be able to talk about everything.

351
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,220
Mmm.

352
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,140
Do you care about me?

353
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:50,940
Don't think that you're the only one in this world.

354
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:03,010
At least,

355
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:07,010
you got me.

356
00:28:58,950 --> 00:28:59,950
See you.

357
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,180
Wait.

358
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,030
I'm off.

359
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:13,150
"Are you not coming to the bar today?"

360
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,210
"So now, you can reply? You've been gone for so long."

361
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:21,370
"Can I not say hi?"

362
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:24,120
"Are you free this Friday?"

363
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,420
"Wanna go to that sweet noodles dessert place?"

364
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,350
"Not so sure yet. I haven't finished my work."

365
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,960
"Got to give something to my in line senior."

366
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:36,680
Mangkorn.

367
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,370
Yes?

368
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:39,510
Your senior is looking for you.

369
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,780
Yes, sir.

370
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,610
Oh, Arjo.

371
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:52,610
How did you get here?

372
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,020
I'm bringing you the stuff.

373
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,180
So how do you do it here? Interning...like it?

374
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,580
I like it.

375
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,380
But...

376
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,820
there's so much work.

377
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,540
Come on. Think of it as a new experience.

378
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,770
Here. The accessories you asked me to buy.

379
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:07,580
I happened to buy a dress to wear this coming Friday.

380
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,860
So I came by and brought these to you.

381
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,850
Thank you so much.

382
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:14,410
You're so kind as always.

383
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,890
Well, yeah, and...

384
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,790
about this Friday, my celebration, are you coming?

385
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,780
But you seem so busy.

386
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:25,710
Mmm. I'll find a way to get there.

387
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,180
Just come over.

388
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:30,060
Okay. I'm off to work now.

389
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,180
See you then.

390
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,180
Focus on your work!

391
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:00,350
And that was a beautiful song by a band called SLAPKISS.

392
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:05,580
The song is called I'm Sorry for Being the Bad Thing in Your Life.

393
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:10,300
Before we say caring goodbye,
don't forget to carry an umbrella with you.

394
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:16,270
Because Thai Meteorological Department
has warned us that there will be heavy rain...

395
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:18,270
around 70% of Bangkok and its perimeters.

396
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,480
Mangkorn.

397
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,920
What are you doing here?

398
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:13,210
And you, Cherry, what are you doing here?

399
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,330
I'm off, then.

400
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:46,570
Cheers!

401
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:53,060
People here have great taste.

402
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:55,060
Hello, Arjo.

403
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:56,780
Yai!

404
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:58,790
I thought you weren't coming.

405
00:34:58,790 --> 00:35:02,000
Well, the beautiful Arjo invited me.

406
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,830
How could I not be here?

407
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,060
Hey, girls!

408
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:09,050
This is Yai from Business Administration.

409
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:11,220
He helped me with my thesis.

410
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,650
And this is Praew, my in line senior.

411
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:15,050
Hello.

412
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:15,850
Hi there.

413
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:19,850
Please take care of Yai tonight, girls.

414
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,770
Oh, here.

415
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,290
A present to congratulate you.

416
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:27,200
Thank you.

417
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,840
I hope you'll like it.

418
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:32,370
I always love it. You got a good taste.

419
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:36,370
And, I thought you were gonna come with Mangkorn...

420
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,400
Mangkorn?

421
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:42,960
Mangkorn, your Architecture friend...

422
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,640
He was here earlier and has just left.

423
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:50,070
He said he was gonna go clear off his work.

424
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,510
Ah...

425
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:56,510
Are you and Mangkorn in line senior and junior?

426
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:59,950
Yeah, Mangkorn and I are in the same line.

427
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,960
How about what happened at the Imperial Building?

428
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:10,200
That Mangkorn and I had a meal together?

429
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,000
And how did you know that?

430
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:17,210
Oh...er...I was there too that day.

431
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:21,000
But I was in the middle of something
so I didn't get a chance to say hi.

432
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,230
I'm sorry about that.

433
00:36:23,230 --> 00:36:25,670
Actually, Praew was supposed to be there too.

434
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,500
But she was busy, so she took a rain check.

435
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,460
C'mon, I had to work that day.

436
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:33,090
So I had to go with Mangkorn, only the two of us.

437
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,190
So are you gonna be with me all night?

438
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,190
Of course, I'm free tonight.

439
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,980
Yai.

440
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:53,290
Nine.

441
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,170
You didn't tell me you were coming back to Thailand, Nine.

442
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:09,600
If I'd told you, it wouldn't have been a surprise.

443
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,140
What surprise?

444
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,930
But honestly,

445
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:18,290
we haven't seen each other in like 3 years already, right?

446
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:21,480
Mmm, come to think of it, yeah.

447
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:27,170
When I got into a uni, we were out of touch.

448
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:29,040
I'm sorry.

449
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,200
I was busy with work.

450
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,710
And there's the time zone thing too.

451
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:37,710
And you, are you still in contact with your high school friends?

452
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,160
Not at all.

453
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,800
Each of us live separate lives.

454
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,760
Some went abroad like you did.

455
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,760
So Nine, what brought you back here to Thailand?

456
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:54,230
Well, work, of course.

457
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:58,230
But...this time, I'm gonna be here longer than usual.

458
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,640
Because my partner in England,

459
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:03,030
he wants to work with me here in Thailand.

460
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,860
Wow, that's so cool.

461
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,820
And how about you, Yai?

462
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,830
How's business?

463
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,850
As usual...

464
00:38:12,850 --> 00:38:15,810
Right now, the bar is being renovated.

465
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:19,880
Mmm, you're good.

466
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,880
You're exaggerating.

467
00:38:24,530 --> 00:38:28,530
Oh, and how about your Dad?

468
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:34,290
My Dad?

469
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:36,050
Well...

470
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,340
Mean as usual.

471
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,740
Mean?

472
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,740
I think your Dad is worried about you.

473
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:49,520
Well, actually, he's not mean.

474
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,520
He just doesn't have much free time.

475
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:57,200
He goes to places a lot.

476
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,880
C'mon, he loves you.

477
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,880
In the future, you'll have to be responsible
for all the businesses, won't you?

478
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,880
I'm not really sure about my future yet.

479
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,880
But it's fortunate that you still have a father.

480
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,160
Since my Dad's passed,

481
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:35,160
I have to carry all of my family's businesses.

482
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:41,810
But I'm used to it already.

483
00:39:41,810 --> 00:39:43,960
Are you okay, Nine?

484
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,770
Oh, yes, I'm okay.

485
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:48,810
Let's talk about you instead.

486
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:51,170
So how are things?
We haven't seen each other for so long.

487
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:54,520
Lots of girls? Huh?

488
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,670
What girls? I got none.

489
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,040
Hey, hey, hey!

490
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,680
How about you?

491
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,800
You're this handsome, good-looking and charming...

492
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,800
there must be lots of girls, right?

493
00:40:06,350 --> 00:40:08,390
What if I told you that I got none?

494
00:40:08,390 --> 00:40:09,890
Would you believe me?

495
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:16,480
Huh?

496
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,870
Can I not?

497
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,340
Then why are you asking?

498
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,550
Well, you asked me first!

499
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,140
So I had to ask you back.

500
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:25,110
Alright, okay, okay.

501
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:28,310
So it's fair...

502
00:40:28,310 --> 00:40:32,310
Anyway, welcome back to Thailand.

503
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,400
Cheers!

504
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:45,190
Yai.

505
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,440
Yai.

506
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:52,600
Oh, Nine.

507
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,800
What are you doing?
Why are you still here?

508
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,800
Er...I lost my car key.

509
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,320
Have you asked the reception?

510
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:06,200
Er...I have but they couldn't find it.

511
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,280
Then, how's this?

512
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,680
Come with me, I'll give you a ride.

513
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,800
That's alright. I don't want to bother you.

514
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,800
I'll call Park and Pong to bring me the key.

515
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:28,060
Are you sure?

516
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,500
Yes, I am.

517
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:30,980
Okay.

518
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,980
Go home safely then.

519
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:46,010
But if there's no one coming,

520
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:48,820
call me, okay?

521
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,820
Yes, thank you.

522
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:07,930
Why aren't Park and Pong answering the phone?

523
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,930
What are they up to?

524
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:28,530
Yai: "What are you doing?"
Mangkorn: "Been working all day, so tired today."

525
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,920
I won't bother then.

526
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,920
I'll go home myself.

527
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,620
Yai.

528
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:31,260
Just leave.

529
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,960
How could you do that?

530
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,710
It's not what it looked like.

531
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:44,600
Oh, you think I got no brain?

532
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,880
You think I got no eyes?

533
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,650
How could you do that?

534
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:52,080
You already have someone.

535
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:52,840
Someone?

536
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,320
The girl at the café.

537
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:56,480
I know that she's not just your junior.

538
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,720
You missed Arjo's celebration.

539
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,200
For this?

540
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,200
To do this shitty thing with who-knows-who?

541
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:11,520
I told you it's not what it looked like.

542
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,920
If it's not what I thought it was, then what was it?

543
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:15,920
Huh?

544
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:23,210
You already got someone.

545
00:44:23,210 --> 00:44:25,360
You shouldn't be doing stuff like this.

546
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,670
Don't you feel sorry for those girls?

547
00:44:27,670 --> 00:44:28,670
You, piece of shit!

548
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:36,290
How dare you punch me?

549
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:40,110
You're a womanizer too, not different than me.

550
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:42,980
Let me say this straight to you.

551
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:46,980
The reason you're acting like you're mad at me,...

552
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:51,520
is it because you're mad for those girls...

553
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,520
or are you mad because you like me?

554
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,560
Answer me!

555
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:03,190
Answer!

556
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,060
Hey, that's a fish.

557
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:50,300
Park, why did you bring a fish?

558
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,340
Hey, and why are we not chopping it?

559
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:53,390
Park.

560
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:54,300
Hey!

561
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,780
I'm starving.

562
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,260
Can you buy me something to eat?

563
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:01,340
Don't you see that it's raining?

564
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,330
I'll get sick.

565
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:04,860
Please, please, please, please.

566
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:08,070
I'm really hungry.

567
00:46:08,070 --> 00:46:09,070
Alright.

568
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,380
Let me have it too.

569
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,060
Pong!

570
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,300
Mr. Yai called.

571
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,690
I didn't answer.

572
00:46:38,690 --> 00:46:39,600
Should we call him back?

573
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,440
Yeah.

574
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:42,120
Hey!

575
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:42,680
Huh?

576
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:43,680
No!

577
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,390
If you call now, we'll be scolded.

578
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:49,510
You're right.

579
00:46:49,510 --> 00:46:51,510
Then, I'll call him back tomorrow morning.

580
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:27,790
So bummed.

581
00:47:27,790 --> 00:47:29,340
First day of the semester and a presentation is needed?

582
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,020
I ordered some food for you.

583
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:32,580
Don't forget to fetch it.

584
00:47:32,580 --> 00:47:33,730
Are you close to Mangkorn?

585
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:34,970
Well, I'm kinda close to him.

586
00:47:34,970 --> 00:47:37,170
We've known each other since we were little.

587
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:37,900
Mr. Yai!

588
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,790
Where did you get all drunk last night?

589
00:47:39,790 --> 00:47:41,110
At Nine's bar.

590
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:45,610
It is 2022's best model award...

591
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,830
Yai, you're still scared of worms?

592
00:47:47,830 --> 00:47:49,670
I still remember when you were in elementary school,

593
00:47:49,670 --> 00:47:51,860
you cried so loud.

594
00:47:51,860 --> 00:47:53,060
Why are you laughing, Nine?

595
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,670
I never wanted to lose you, Yai.

596
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,380
Before this, my life was good all along.
