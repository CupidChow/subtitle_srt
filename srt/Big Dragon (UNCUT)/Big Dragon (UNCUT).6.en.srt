2
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,380
I've ordered you some food.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,870
Don't forget to fetch it.

4
00:00:09,870 --> 00:00:11,000
Are you close to Mangkorn?

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:14,530
Well, I'm kinda close to him.
We've known each other since we were little.

6
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:15,540
I've already added my number.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,050
And pressed follow my Instagram account.

8
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,030
Where did you get all drunk last night?

9
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,070
At Nine's bar.

10
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,410
Are you alright, Yai?

11
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,850
Yai, you're still scared of worms?

12
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:26,940
Kampai! Yeah!

13
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,470
...you just care about your own feelings.

14
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,110
You're selfish, you know that?

15
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:36,110
...if you're interested in the Masters' scholarship in New York.

16
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,480
I'd rather not.

17
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:38,880
I wouldn't get it.

18
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,380
There are so many people better than me.

19
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:25,940
ONE HOUR EARLIER

20
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,750
I saw the program that you'd sent me.

21
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:41,470
Have you thought this through?

22
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,070
If I were away for a few years,

23
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,160
would everything get better, Ma?

24
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,090
But you know, right?

25
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,800
Doing that is running away from the problem...

26
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:20,180
And the boy I saw earlier...

27
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,940
wouldn't he miss you,

28
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,940
if he knew that you're going to study in New York?

29
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,400
I won't stop you from loving anyone.

30
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:41,430
What if I don't like girls, Ma?

31
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:52,079
Will you be okay with that?

32
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:58,170
Of course, I will.

33
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,530
These days, the genders aren't the indicator...

34
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,530
of how long a couple will last.

35
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,290
Does that mean you've already found someone you like?

36
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,080
Right, sweetheart?

37
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,080
No.

38
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,860
Look at that smile.

39
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,010
Do you have a pic?

40
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,800
Let me see it.

41
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,050
No!

42
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:30,020
C'mon, please, let me see it.

43
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,020
Alright, alright.

44
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,300
He's cute.

45
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,300
Sweet smile.

46
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:46,320
I've liked him since I was a freshman in uni.

47
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,560
What's his name?

48
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,890
You don't have to know.

49
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,010
And when will I...

50
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,690
Introduce him to me.

51
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,410
I'm leaving.

52
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,540
No, you must introduce him to me.

53
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:56,700
Wait...

54
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,790
Then don't go back today.

55
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,150
Call him up and invite him here.

56
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:00,160
This evening...

57
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,160
I'm off, Ma, I'm off.

58
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,880
You're so mean.

59
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,880
It's been such a short time, and I haven't...

60
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,970
It was delicious!

61
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,970
I never thought that there would be such a nice restaurant here.

62
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,590
mangkorn_x69 replied to your story: Are you alone? Can I see you?

63
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,870
Well, Nine.

64
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,070
Huh?

65
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:06,560
I'm sorry...

66
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,040
that I was so drunk at your bar last night.

67
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,040
Oh.

68
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,770
Don't mention it.

69
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,780
It's nothing.

70
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,500
I'm not mad.

71
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,180
But what I should be mad about...

72
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,100
is that you didn't wake me up this morning.

73
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:26,230
Well, you slept so well...

74
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:28,230
Who would dare wake you up.

75
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:30,750
Alright, fair enough.

76
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,200
I don't know why...

77
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,190
but everytime I talk to you,

78
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,190
I always think of when we were little.

79
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,090
Why's that?

80
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,500
Do you remember when I had to take an extra class,

81
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,909
and you was whiny and wanted to follow me.

82
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:01,830
And in the end, you found a way to sit in my class.

83
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:05,310
And kept bothering me so much that I couldn't study.

84
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,840
What?

85
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,840
That time, I was still so young.

86
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,300
Seriously,

87
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,740
Aside from Ying, who's my sister...

88
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,740
there's you, Nine, who's like a brother to me.

89
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,750
And is that a good thing or a bad thing?

90
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,540
It's good.

91
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,390
But...

92
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,870
when I went to uni,

93
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,880
You went to England.

94
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:40,120
I...

95
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,120
felt like I lost my brother.

96
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,450
Well, I'm back now.

97
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,200
This place got a really nice atmosphere.

98
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,730
That's true.

99
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,800
mangkorn_x69: Can we talk?

100
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:20,620
It's really nice.

101
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:24,620
And if we happened to be here with someone we like,
that'd be great.

102
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:27,690
Mmm.

103
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,220
Are you alright?

104
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,830
Huh?

105
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,310
Not really.

106
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:48,080
Not really? So what's that about?

107
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,450
Can you tell me?

108
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,450
Yes.

109
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,730
Well...

110
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,130
It's a love problem.

111
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,050
I just think that...

112
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:06,260
all those times mean nothing.

113
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:13,090
So I'm kind of tired of love these days.

114
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,030
Look at that.

115
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:33,010
How could you eat and get that on your shoe?

116
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,330
Hey, it's alright.

117
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:36,179
I'll wipe it myself.

118
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,179
That's alright. It's nothing.

119
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:51,350
Thank you.

120
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,110
I'm such a bother.

121
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:59,710
But this pair of shoes...

122
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:04,080
I saw you wear them since you were a senior in high school.

123
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,580
They're that old.
Aren't they too tight for you already?

124
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,640
Well, yes.

125
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,330
But they're my favorite shoes.

126
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,980
I wear them every once in a while.

127
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:24,390
Actually, love is like choosing a pair of shoes.

128
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:33,570
The pair that we look for is usually pretty, just the way we like it.

129
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,990
But...sometimes, they don't always fit you.

130
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,710
Wow.

131
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,750
Father of the quotes.

132
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,400
It's just a metaphor.

133
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,400
And what about you? What kind of love are you looking for?

134
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,450
I don't know.

135
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,450
I haven't thought about it.

136
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,260
How about you, Nine?

137
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,260
What kind of love would you like?

138
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,990
Mmm.

139
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:24,110
I...I'd like the love that makes me comfortable.

140
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,110
Before, I used to find the love like that.

141
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:33,090
When I was in England,

142
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:37,590
I only looked for my type, ones that I liked.

143
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:46,460
But in the end,

144
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,750
I learned that,

145
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:53,750
the one who makes me comfortable isn't far from me.

146
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Whom are you talking about?

147
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:08,830
"It's alright."

148
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:13,030
"I'm not mad that you left me."

149
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:18,790
"I'm ready to understand."

150
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,790
Next time, buy me and bring it to the bar.

151
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:27,350
Don't you know that when we share food, it tastes better?

152
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,090
Hey!

153
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:32,920
Yeah, take it, I'll eat this.

154
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,570
Oh, so good.

155
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,250
Very very good.

156
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,380
Why does yours taste better than mine?

157
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:42,690
"A guy like me doesn't deserve to be loved."

158
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:48,980
"or doesn't deserve your hug, "your kiss."

159
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,980
"I have no right to tell you that I love you."

160
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:27,220
Nine, why are you doing this?

161
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,850
I'm sorry.

162
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,020
Excuse me.

163
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,100
Go! Go! Mangkorn, don't fall!

164
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:53,170
Go! Go! Mangkorn!

165
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,170
Go! Go!

166
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,300
Why isn't it up in the air?

167
00:13:57,750 --> 00:14:01,750
Wow, that seems so fun. Can I play with you?

168
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:02,830
Yeah, of course.

169
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
But I've never played it.

170
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:15,210
It's alright. I've never played it too. Why don't you try it?

171
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
Mmm.

172
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,170
Go! Go!

173
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,410
Go! Go!

174
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:30,660
Yai, let's go. Our parents may see it.

175
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:39,750
Thanks. But what's your name?

176
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,360
My name is...

177
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,360
Yai! Ying! I've been looking for you everywhere.
Here you are.

178
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,840
Let's go home.

179
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,320
Yai, let's go.

180
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:29,930
And the boy I saw earlier...

181
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:32,480
wouldn't he miss you

182
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,480
if he knew that you're going to study in New York?

183
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,090
Hello, Mr. Pun.

184
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:49,980
I would like to talk to you about the masters' scholarship.

185
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:52,980
Oh, okay, what is it, Mangkorn?

186
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,980
What if I change my mind and not go,

187
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,900
could that be possible?

188
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,020
You mean giving it to other people? No.

189
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,060
Because I've already handed in your name.

190
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,180
And you've already signed the paper.

191
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:10,180
And the dean specifically said that it's not changeable.

192
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,860
Do you have any problems, Mangkorn?

193
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,150
You can tell me.

194
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:17,150
Oh, it's nothing.

195
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,430
And...what's the chance of me...

196
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,330
getting to go?

197
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:29,130
Mmm, frankly speaking, this year...

198
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:31,730
It's 50-50 chance.

199
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:36,500
Because the competitor from the other uni
also sent internationally awarded student.

200
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,860
But the result will come out in a month.

201
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,000
I hope you have time to prepare yourself if you get selected.

202
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,530
Right, Mangkorn.

203
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:47,100
I have to go now. I got a class to teach.

204
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,100
Alright, sir.

205
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:13,730
Er...I'm sorry, Nine,

206
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:17,220
for bothering you to give me a ride again.

207
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,220
You're welcome. For you, Yai, I'm always available.

208
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,550
Oh.

209
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:27,750
And how long will it take for this place to be completely renovated?

210
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:34,050
I think it might take around a year.

211
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:37,890
Because I'm changing some structures.

212
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,890
But when it's finished, please come over, Nine.

213
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,860
Of course.

214
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,350
About that night...

215
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,570
I'm sorry.

216
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:10,530
If it was too soon and it surprised you...

217
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,140
It's alright.

218
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:23,810
But...please don't do it again, Nine.

219
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:30,140
We're like siblings. It's better this way.

220
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,100
Mmm.

221
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,150
Excuse me.

222
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:49,670
See you.

223
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Bye-bye.

224
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,460
We've been notified that there will be a change at the ceiling here...

225
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,580
to make it better.

226
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,810
Because there's a problem with it now.

227
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:10,810
Mmm.

228
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:14,020
Oh, Mr. Yai, hello.

229
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,420
Hello, Mr. Rat.

230
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,750
How's everything? Is it going well?

231
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,230
It's going well.

232
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:23,120
Today, the engineer will come in and check the durability of the structure...

233
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,440
that Mr. Barom would like to expand on this bar.

234
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,880
Yesterday, I got the see the draft.

235
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,970
It's very pretty.

236
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,250
May I ask...

237
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,380
who the designer is?

238
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,380
Oh. Mangkorn, our intern.

239
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,980
Ah, there he is. Speaking of the devil...

240
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,830
Er...Mr. Yai, are you not happy...

241
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:52,400
that we used our intern's work?

242
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,480
Well, I'd like to tell you that Mangkorn was awarded with...

243
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:58,000
It's not about that.

244
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,680
Oh, right.

245
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:05,680
Then, I'll have Mangkorn talk to you about the furniture in this suite.

246
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:10,320
Er...would you excuse me? I'll go see the bar downstairs with Park and Pong.

247
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,010
Park. Pong.

248
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:13,410
I'll leave this to you.

249
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:15,100
Please take care of it.

250
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,180
Right away, Mr. Yai.

251
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,940
Please excuse me, Mr. Yai.

252
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,690
I'll leave it to you.

253
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,410
Er...

254
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,810
Mr. Yai.

255
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,810
This is the interior design that Mr. Barom has listed.

256
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:43,130
And the additional furniture that Mr. Barom would like will be built-ins.

257
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,410
No need to.

258
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:48,170
I'll change this room into a bathroom instead.

259
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:51,300
And this luxrurios bed,

260
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:53,670
change it into a toilet.

261
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,950
It suits the memory of that night.

262
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:07,310
All these months with me,

263
00:21:10,190 --> 00:21:12,190
and this is all you can think of?

264
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:17,050
Could you please speak to the client nicely?

265
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:19,050
Mr. Akira.

266
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,360
Please.

267
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,800
Would you talk to me the way you used to?

268
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
I have nothing to say to you.

269
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
And...aren't you sad about our story?

270
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,650
We just had a fight for a few days...

271
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,020
and then you kissed somebody else?

272
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,870
Who is he?

273
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,670
You've forgotten about us?

274
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,880
Anything about you,

275
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,210
I don't remember.

276
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:22,210
It's a waste of time.

277
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,740
Alright.

278
00:22:37,150 --> 00:22:38,150
I'm sorry.

279
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,270
For wasting your time.

280
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,950
But all these times,

281
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,020
for me, they're not a waste.

282
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,680
Things between us,...

283
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
though it started with this shitty incident,

284
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,920
for me, it's not.

285
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:14,740
I...

286
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,740
You and I...

287
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:21,230
are like people who want to get close to the sun.

288
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,670
The closer we are,

289
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,670
the hotter it will get.

290
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,480
And in the end,

291
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,480
no one can bear it.

292
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,400
Stop fighting it, Mangkorn.

293
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:09,770
Get out.

294
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:14,060
I want to be alone.

295
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:55,590
Thanks but what's your name?

296
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,790
Oh, thanks.

297
00:25:17,770 --> 00:25:18,770
Yai.

298
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:19,970
Let's have breakfast together.

299
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:22,740
C’mon.

300
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,980
Let's eat.

301
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,260
Where is Ying?

302
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,660
On her shift.

303
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,660
She's a doctor. She won't have free time like you.

304
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,390
How could you say that?

305
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,570
Yesterday, I was working on the bar renovation.

306
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:10,230
Alright, I was just kidding.

307
00:26:10,230 --> 00:26:12,270
You seem sad lately.

308
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:15,270
If you wanna go chill somewhere, you can go.

309
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:22,300
Er...Yai, how are you doing these days? Studying hard?

310
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:27,490
Next school break, I'd like to invite you to China.

311
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:29,490
If you want to go...

312
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,380
Would you like to?

313
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,120
But I don't want to.

314
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:42,480
If you want to go, then go with my Dad, just the two of you!

315
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,950
Why are you inviting me?

316
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,510
Where are you going? You haven't eaten.

317
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,640
I'm going to Mom's grave.

318
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,450
Today is Mom's birthday.

319
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:51,450
You can't even remember your wife's birthday!

320
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:56,610
Would you remember your son's death day?!

321
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,530
Yai.

322
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,960
What should I do, Mom?

323
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:05,780
There are so many problems now.

324
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,620
You know.

325
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:19,550
When you're not around,

326
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:23,390
our home isn't the same anymore.

327
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,960
In the past,

328
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,400
I was so happy.

329
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,840
And it was very warming.

330
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
Now, our family only talks about money.

331
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:47,200
It's not as happy and warm as it used to be anymore.

332
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,550
Dad always works.

333
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,240
If you were still here,

334
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:07,930
I wouldn't feel this lonely.

335
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,820
I miss you, Mom.

336
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,400
What's wrong?

337
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,290
Why the face?

338
00:31:11,290 --> 00:31:12,290
Tell me.

339
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,530
Well...

340
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,170
It's about Yai, Ajo.

341
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,460
What happened?

342
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,460
After that day, did you talk to him?

343
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,110
I did yesterday.

344
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:41,190
But it didn't turn out well.

345
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,840
Love's like this, you know.

346
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,120
If you love someone,

347
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:54,120
you must put yourself in their shoes.

348
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:00,390
And you must be patient.

349
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:01,390
Yes.

350
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,840
And have you talked to Mr. Pun that you don't wanna do masters?

351
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:15,180
Yes, I have.

352
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,390
But he has already handed in my name.

353
00:32:21,630 --> 00:32:24,350
So I thought...

354
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:30,350
if I really get it, I won't go.

355
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:34,770
Can we do that?

356
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,610
Yes.

357
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:40,810
There must be a runner up.

358
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:44,890
Hey.

359
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,660
Think carefully.

360
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:49,510
If you really get it,

361
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,640
you may lose your opportunity.

362
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,780
Wow.

363
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,380
Yai.

364
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,020
Yai? Is it?

365
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:31,950
Oh.

366
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:34,330
Mangkorn's Mom.

367
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:37,980
Hello.

368
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,920
Hi, you can call me Ma.

369
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,740
Oh, have a seat, please.

370
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,750
Then, thank you.

371
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,340
It's crowded here.

372
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,670
It's fortunate I got to see you.

373
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:02,670
Normally before I go back, I always come here.

374
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:05,630
The food here is amazing.

375
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,240
Yes.

376
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:10,530
Can I take your order?

377
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,980
1 Bak kut teh, please.

378
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,980
One moment, please.

379
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:25,190
You've ordered what you want to have already, right?

380
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:27,719
It's on me, alright?

381
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:27,719
Er, it's alright. Don't bother, please, Ma.

382
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:35,770
It's okay, please think of me as another mother of yours, alright.

383
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:39,730
Yes.

384
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:50,860
What's that lace?

385
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,340
It belonged to my Mom.

386
00:34:59,350 --> 00:35:02,200
I just got it back from Mangkorn.

387
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,240
Mangkorn?

388
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,130
My Mangkorn?

389
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:08,130
Yes.

390
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:11,700
Ah.

391
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,790
You're that kid?

392
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,750
Yes, Ma.

393
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:24,030
I'm so sorry.

394
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:28,000
I did try to find to owner.

395
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,000
But during that time, there was no technology like today.

396
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,240
And it's been a long time ago.

397
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,240
So I forgot about it.

398
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,280
It's alright, Ma.

399
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:44,780
Actually, I forgot that I used to wear it too.

400
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:53,010
But when I saw it, touched it...

401
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:57,800
it reminded me of my Mom, Ma.

402
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:13,370
The food is here.

403
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,930
This is Bak kut teh that I ordered.

404
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:56,600
Make a wish, sweetie.

405
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,660
Yes, Mom.

406
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,250
Good boy!

407
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,920
Alright, let's eat!

408
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:17,930
This one, this piece.

409
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,060
Yai, try it.

410
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,500
Okay.

411
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,390
Oh.

412
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,000
So?

413
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,090
Ew, so bitter.

414
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:33,700
I don't like it.

415
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,910
How could it be bitter? It's sweet.

416
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,850
If you don't believe me, try it.

417
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,620
No.

418
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,380
C'mon.

419
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,230
No!

420
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,470
You wanna try?

421
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,270
Is it bitter?

422
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:50,790
It's really sweet, actually.

423
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,290
Your Dad loves it too.

424
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:56,970
Are you okay?

425
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,030
Are you alright?

426
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:18,930
Are you okay, dear?

427
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,070
You can't focus?

428
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,280
Huh?

429
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,680
Here, drink this. It will freshen you up.

430
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,090
Hang on.

431
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,750
Thank you so much, Nine.

432
00:39:54,750 --> 00:39:57,110
But you don't have to next time.

433
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:00,110
Just giving me a ride is so much already.

434
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:04,360
I've done this since you were in school, haven't I, huh?

435
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:11,990
How's it?

436
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,030
Sour.

437
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:17,640
That's good, so you will be freshened up.

438
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:23,220
Oh, and where are Pong and Park? I haven't seen them.

439
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,220
Oh, I sent them to see the renovation at the bar.

440
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:31,260
Oh, alright.

441
00:40:37,630 --> 00:40:40,240
I have to go to a meeting now.

442
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,520
I'll pick you up on the way back.

443
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,520
Hey, it's alright, Nine. I'll have Park and Pong pick me up.

444
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,240
Oh, are you sure?

445
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:52,210
Okay.

446
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:54,210
But if you want me to pick you up, let me know.

447
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:57,970
Alright.

448
00:40:58,810 --> 00:40:59,810
Then, I'm off.

449
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,050
You got this, alright?

450
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,800
Bye.

451
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:31,180
Here. Your Ma had me deliver this for you to cook.

452
00:41:35,430 --> 00:41:36,430
Mmm.

453
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
Why do you look so troubled?

454
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,440
Are you worried about Yai?

455
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:56,970
Mmm.

456
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:02,570
Well, since that day.

457
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:05,530
We haven't talked.

458
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,190
Actually...

459
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:14,190
It's kinda my fault too. I shouldn't have got in to get stuff here that day.

460
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:17,000
I'm sorry, Mangkorn.

461
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:20,010
Hey, it's alright.

462
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:23,090
It's not your fault.

463
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:26,340
It's my fault.

464
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,860
The thing is...

465
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,860
I haven't told him the truth from the beginning.

466
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,300
It's really bad, don't you think?

467
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,980
The point where you can't choose anything.

468
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:57,780
Even the one you like.

469
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:13,730
Actually, if we tell our Pas, they might listen to us.

470
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:17,300
Pas aren't that bad.

471
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:21,300
Our families are nice.

472
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,110
How about this?

473
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:27,110
I'll help you do the talking too.

474
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:40,160
But come to think of it, Mangkorn...

475
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,160
Some things—it's not that we can't choose;

476
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:50,040
it's just that we don't dare choose.

477
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,710
Wow.

478
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:26,340
Look at their presentation.

479
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:30,340
Their slides, I think they hired a graphic designer to make them.

480
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:35,190
And look at ours. We're still using free templates.

481
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:38,460
Well, it works out just fine too.

482
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:39,790
Don't complain.

483
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:43,790
Instead of complaining,
why don't you prepare the presentaion and the good answers?

484
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:47,630
Or else we would fail this subject.

485
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:50,240
Mmm, true.

486
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,240
Hey, where's George? Isn't he here yet?

487
00:44:54,730 --> 00:44:57,980
It's almost our turn to do the presentation.

488
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,980
Speaking of the devil...

489
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,190
Shit.

490
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:07,270
I thought our class was at 1 p.m. It's at noon?

491
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:09,080
Yes, it is, George.

492
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,490
You're late as usual.

493
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:12,010
Damn.

494
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:13,770
Guys.

495
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:15,560
I saw a guy from Architecture named Mangkorn...

496
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,770
getting all sneaky in front of our building.

497
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:20,170
I think he's here to score Business Administration girls.

498
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:21,090
Really?

499
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:21,620
Yeah.

500
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:22,580
Which Mangkorn?

501
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:25,780
Mangkorn, the one we saw last semester at the studio.

502
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:28,430
People said that he's a womanizer.

503
00:45:28,430 --> 00:45:32,430
Girls are all over him because he likes to hunt.

504
00:45:32,750 --> 00:45:33,670
You're so silly.

505
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:34,930
Hey, I'm for real, man.

506
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:35,730
You're nuts.

507
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:37,930
One more thing, we need to protect our B.A. girls!

508
00:45:37,930 --> 00:45:41,850
Hey, what's that talking?

509
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:44,380
What's your name?

510
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,180
It's George.

511
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:50,180
What did your classmates say during the presentation?

512
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,340
You can't answer, can you?

513
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:57,340
If you can't, then I'll have to cut off 1,000 points from you.

514
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:01,240
What? Isn't the full score a 100?

515
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,210
Come here, guys. This is because you talked too much.

516
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:05,660
Come here and start your presentation.

517
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:06,790
George!

518
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:07,600
Come down here!

519
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,810
You're a bad luck to all of us.

520
00:46:08,810 --> 00:46:09,340
I'm sorry.

521
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:09,990
George!

522
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:10,870
Whoa!

523
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,280
Get up!

524
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:13,280
What chapter is my part?

525
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,680
What chapter?

526
00:46:22,730 --> 00:46:23,730
Hey, is Park here yet?

527
00:46:26,290 --> 00:46:28,780
George, today, you almost dragged us all down.

528
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,300
Yeah, but it went well at last.

529
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:34,990
Hey, isn't that Mangkorn?

530
00:46:34,990 --> 00:46:36,150
Why is he still here?

531
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:37,310
It's been an hour.

532
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:38,630
Damn, that's true.

533
00:46:38,630 --> 00:46:39,800
What is he doing here?

534
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:45,420
Hunting girls at our faculty, of course.

535
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,180
We need to protect the girls!

536
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,590
Don't let him get the girls.

537
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:51,750
You've been so silly since before the presentation.

538
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,870
Hello, Park, where are you?

539
00:46:53,870 --> 00:46:55,800
We're here, Mr. Yai.

540
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,610
Where did you park?

541
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:59,760
In front of the building as always.

542
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,760
Hey, there they are, Park and Pong.

543
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:19,300
Guys, I'm off.

544
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:19,810
Alright.

545
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:19,970
See ya.

546
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:21,380
See you.

547
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:22,020
Later, man.

548
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:22,620
Later, later.

549
00:47:27,710 --> 00:47:28,710
Yai.

550
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:35,150
Can I hit on you again?

551
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,350
I guess.

552
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:37,620
I wish you luck.

553
00:48:37,620 --> 00:48:40,630
Mangkorn and I aren't a thing.

554
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:41,950
Yet.

555
00:48:41,950 --> 00:48:43,270
But we're about to.

556
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:47,240
Here. Prawn dumpling, Yai's favorite.

557
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,680
You're allergic to prawns, right?

558
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,650
Are you thinking about hitting on Yai?

559
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:52,130
I happened to be here first.

560
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:55,530
When you said you were here first, was it about 10 years ago?

561
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:58,370
What if we both hadn't met at the bar,...

562
00:48:58,370 --> 00:49:01,530
do you think we would have gotten to this point?

563
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:05,520
No matter what, I'll have to find a way to get to you anyway.

564
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,520
Because you are the only one in my heart.
