2
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,850
"Did I screw your brains out last night?"

3
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,470
What's up?

4
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:47,990
Last night...

5
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,400
did you have fun?

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,800
Fun, my ass.

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:51,600
Last night was just...

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,600
You were the one who asked for more, more, more and more, weren't you?

9
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:11,500
It's been just a few hours ago.

10
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,500
How could you not remember?

11
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,740
What a shame!

12
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,580
Stop talking.

13
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,030
And forget about last night.

14
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,520
How could I?

15
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,240
It was the hottest night of us two.

16
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,240
You could make a sexy face?

17
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,650
I thought you could only make a fierce face.

18
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:37,950
But in the video that you got, there's your face too.

19
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,240
I could always censor my face.

20
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,729
Don't be so stupid.

21
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,940
Can't you come up with that?

22
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:47,940
You know, what you did was horrible.

23
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:52,200
But I was onto it.

24
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,520
Listen to me now.

25
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,210
No matter what you do,

26
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:00,290
you're never going to beat me.

27
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,410
And about last night,

28
00:02:02,410 --> 00:02:05,410
You won't be able to forget it.

29
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,650
Hello? Hello?

30
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,290
A legend says...

31
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,250
in the ancient times, the Chinese people

32
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,900
had given the four corners of the skies

33
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,150
to the protection of the four divine creatures.

34
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:54,870
Green Dragon.

35
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,680
White Tiger.

36
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,079
Red Phoenix.

37
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,840
And Black Turtoise.

38
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,120
But in this legend,

39
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,760
it's Mangkorn (dragon)

40
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,810
and Yai.

41
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:10,140
Two flirtatious guys,

42
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,950
agressive,

43
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,630
along the path,

44
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,630
which would change my life and Mangkorn's forever.

45
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:54,079
Yeah, yeah. That's it. That's a good shot.

46
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,400
Right, and why isn't Mangkorn here yet?

47
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,320
Milin.

48
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,050
Milin!

49
00:03:59,050 --> 00:03:59,930
Huh, Pa?

50
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,540
Have you called Mangkorn yet?

51
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,340
It's almost over. Why isn't he here yet?

52
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,780
I called once, he didn't answer.

53
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,860
Mmm, can you try calling him one more time?

54
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,580
Yes.

55
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,470
Calm down. The traffic's bad. He'll be here. Just enjoy that.

56
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:16,019
It's almost over...

57
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:19,829
Hello, bro, where are you? Ma and Pa have been waiting for you.

58
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:22,990
Tell them, Lin, that I won't be able to make it.

59
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,110
I gotta study with my friends, alright?

60
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,430
Okay.

61
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:29,430
Tell Pa that, alright. See ya.

62
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,280
Was that your girlfriend?

63
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,700
It wasn't.

64
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:01,700
It's my sister.

65
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,180
Have you been waiting long?

66
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,130
For you, Da...

67
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,130
no matter how long it takes, I'll wait.

68
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,980
Are you tired of your own bar?

69
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,980
Why are you inviting me to this instead?

70
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,110
Do you want me to do that...the stuff that we did?

71
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,550
Da, wanna eat anything?

72
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,550
Eh...I'd like to eat something big...

73
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,830
Is there anything big around here?

74
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,650
Doing a business in Singhawattanachok's way,

75
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,930
is like planting seeds into the ground.

76
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,450
And wait for them to grow.

77
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:47,210
Therefore, we need to think about the soil, water, sunlight, and air.

78
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:49,810
Is it adequate for those seeds?

79
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,850
It's like finding the right spot to do the business.

80
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,620
You may get the profit.

81
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,980
You may lose some.

82
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,630
But overall, you'll know how to solve the problems.

83
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,150
Wow, Yai is so awesome.

84
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,160
Aside from being handsome, rich and great profile,

85
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,120
he's still good at studying.

86
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,250
Right, I want half of what that guy has.

87
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,370
Girls will be all over me.

88
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,460
Mmm.

89
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,310
Guys, look!

90
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,040
Huh?

91
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,200
Ajo, the star of Faculty of Architecture.

92
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,280
So pretty.

93
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,480
Really pretty.

94
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,090
She's like an angel.

95
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,890
Look.

96
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:25,780
So, any words for those interested in doing this kind of business?

97
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,270
Like I said before,...

98
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,500
starting a business is like trying with trial and error.

99
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,550
Therefore, we must dare to risk it.

100
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,860
Dare to invest.

101
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:38,740
And dare to face failures.

102
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:42,190
Lastly, I'd like to tell the juniors that...

103
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:44,240
learning by trial and error,

104
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,920
and believe in your own goal.

105
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,650
I do believe that

106
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:54,290
a new generation like us has the efficiency to definitely improve the country.

107
00:07:54,290 --> 00:08:00,170
Wow, that's great. So can I ask you a personal question then?

108
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:04,170
You are so perfect. Have you got a girlfriend?

109
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,930
Not yet.

110
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,980
Cut!

111
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,030
Okay, all set here.

112
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:17,030
Okay.

113
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,990
Thank you so much for giving me the interview today.

114
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:25,550
You're very welcome.

115
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:28,840
I didn't think that I would see you here, Ajo.

116
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,290
Are you here helping out the university's work?

117
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:33,940
Right. I'm kinda free now so I'm here to help with the uni's work.

118
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,710
So that means, I will get to see you more often, right?

119
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:41,710
Not really. I'm actually quite busy with the all interviewing.

120
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,790
I'm a new graduate, so I want to work in the right place, you know.

121
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,200
Mmm, you have my support.

122
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,200
Thanks.

123
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,090
Er...Ajo.

124
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:58,370
Are you free this Wednesday?

125
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,290
This Wednesday?

126
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,540
Mmm...

127
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,350
There's actually a new movie showing.

128
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:09,120
So I thought maybe I could invite you to see it together.

129
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,120
Wednesday? Hmm, I'm actually not.

130
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,080
Well, I got something to do.

131
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:19,080
But if it's in the evening, I could make it.

132
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,810
Then we can meet in the evening.

133
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,810
We can have dinner and then a movie afterwards.

134
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:29,460
I'll keep you posted, okay?

135
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,460
Certainly.

136
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,270
Then, excuse me.

137
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,550
Oh, wait.

138
00:09:36,550 --> 00:09:40,670
Can you wait for a group photo? I'll do a couple more and then it's done.

139
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:42,120
Just hold on, would you?

140
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,760
Oh, of course.

141
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,760
You wait, okay?

142
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,700
So the next one...

143
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,700
Wow, aren't you charming?

144
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:57,150
That's the star of Architecture.

145
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,510
What?

146
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:01,110
We're still friends.

147
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,210
Oh.

148
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:07,210
To her, you are, but is she to you?

149
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,220
That's right.

150
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,750
Last semester, you helped her with her work.

151
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,720
And you're from Business Administration.

152
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Alright, c'mon now.

153
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,090
Stop getting on his nerves.

154
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:21,090
I think we should talk about our school breaks's trip.

155
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:23,490
Guys, are you done packing?

156
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,010
Done.

157
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:29,010
I'm so ready for the prawns, shellfish, crabs and fishes in Maldives?

158
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,100
Hey, Poon, you got the tickets ready, right?

159
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,000
Tickets?

160
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,010
Shit, I forgot.

161
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:39,930
Shit!!!

162
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,450
Poon!

163
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,780
It's okay, I'll handle it.

164
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,430
But, but, but, don't you invite any more people, alright?

165
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,230
We're going there as the handsome four of the Business Administration.

166
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,980
Right, George?

167
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,110
What the hell is wrong with you?

168
00:10:56,110 --> 00:11:00,110
Well, the handsome four of the Business Administration.

169
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,160
What the hell?

170
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,520
I'd like to hear about your inspitation of this work.

171
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,520
Could you, Mangkorn, brifely tell us?

172
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:42,460
This work is the design of the skywalk over the big intersection.

173
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:48,580
It involves geometric, and the green area that is eco-friendly.

174
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,860
This will make people more convenient

175
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,980
and safer.

176
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,060
This area will be crucial to the public transportation.

177
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,060
Also, this will be the interchange to the sky train in the future.

178
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:05,100
Wow, this is such an amazing concept.

179
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,750
That's why you got an award from France.

180
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:15,230
So, what made you realize that you liked working in this field?

181
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,830
Actually, I think it's because...

182
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,680
when I think or design something,

183
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,680
I'll feel good and happy about it.

184
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,220
But if you ask me if I ever have my downs,

185
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,900
I do, sometimes.

186
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,900
That means you've learnt by trials and errors for multiple times, right?

187
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:40,440
Yes, but even young people like us can do that as many times as you want,

188
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,560
You can't deny that money takes you further.

189
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,370
is...money.

190
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:53,500
You can't deny that money takes you further.

191
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:01,380
Three...Two...

192
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,100
"Great architect student, awarded from France, Akira Chisanupongkul."

193
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,260
"Mangkorn, you're so handsome.

194
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,590
"Another architect student awarded? That's awesome!"

195
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,870
"My all-time idol!"

196
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,030
"I'd like to be as good as him. Great vision too."

197
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,540
"Did a guy named Yai come here to brag about his family's business?"

198
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,320
"Trial and error requires money, too."

199
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,520
"Handsome, but he's a player."

200
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,680
Hello, what is it?

201
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,760
Mr. Yai, are you coming to the bar tonight?

202
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,760
Yeah, I'll be there.

203
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:15,920
"So are you free for a movie this afternoon?"

204
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:20,570
"I have a meeting to attend. Let's do it some other time."

205
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,420
"That's alright. Don't forget to have dinner."

206
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:36,020
It's not so often that I could have a chance to have dinner with you.

207
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,900
Because I'm so busy, right?

208
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,900
After a meal with you, I got a meeting with my clients.

209
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,050
Last time, I ditched you, I still feel guilty till now.

210
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,330
That's alright.

211
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:52,140
Just having a meal with you,

212
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:56,390
with this nice atmosphere, beautiful view...

213
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,760
and a beautiful girl like you...

214
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,680
This makes me happy.

215
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,970
You're being too nice.

216
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,970
I can't even tell if you're telling the truth or the lie, you know.

217
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:10,740
On the other day, and I'm happy for you about the award.

218
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,070
At the setting, it was so chaotic. I didn't know when to congratulate you.

219
00:15:14,550 --> 00:15:16,880
Thank you so much, Ajo.

220
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,880
If I didn't get an advice from you, I might not get the award.

221
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,360
You've got it in you already.

222
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,880
I'm jealous that you have this kind of talent.

223
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,090
Mr. Pun asked me to ask you

224
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:36,090
if you're interested in the Masters' scholarship in New York.

225
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,140
New York?

226
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,390
Yeah, the same one that I got.

227
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:44,520
Oh, I'd rather not.

228
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,240
I wouldn't get it.

229
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,400
One more thing, there are so many people better than me.

230
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:52,010
And I have a trainee thingy to do too.

231
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:56,010
And Ajo, have you looked for the place to work?

232
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:00,850
Right now, I'm a freelancer.

233
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,840
Actually, I've sent my resumes to lots of places.

234
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,440
But the interior job that I'd really like,

235
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,170
there aren't many spots available.

236
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,340
There are only design development spots available.

237
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,700
That's not my expertise.

238
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:14,500
But you, you're good at designing, aren't you?

239
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,660
Concepts and Sketching?

240
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:21,500
I heard that you're the first of your entire class.

241
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,380
Well, not really.

242
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,950
But I have to thank you, Ajo.

243
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:30,450
For having me help you with your thesis that time.

244
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:31,530
Thank me?

245
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,820
Why is that?

246
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
I, am the one to thank you.

247
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,660
Well, that work gave me experiences.

248
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:43,980
One more thing, I could take a closer care of you.

249
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:48,710
So no guys would ever hit on you.

250
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:52,710
You. You've always encouraged me, you know.

251
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,710
If I get a job in the company that I like,

252
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,640
let's celebrate, alright?

253
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,150
Sure.

254
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,400
Let's eat.

255
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,520
Okay.

256
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,760
You like tomatoes, right?

257
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,410
Yes.

258
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,410
Take it.

259
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:24,099
Hmm, how many times have I told you, Park?

260
00:17:24,099 --> 00:17:25,819
The right end goes over the left end

261
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:27,589
when tying a tie.

262
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,270
Why do I always have to teach you?

263
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:31,520
Hey, don't complain.

264
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,920
Hurry up!

265
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,440
Hey, chill.

266
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,440
Almost done.

267
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,250
Just a sec.

268
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,250
Huh? What?

269
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,180
Hello?

270
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,860
Yes.

271
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,380
Hello, Mr. Yai.

272
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,510
Park and Pong aren't here yet?

273
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,510
They are, sir, but I don't know where they're at.

274
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,150
Yes, Dad?

275
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,540
What are you doing?

276
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,120
I'm at the bar.

277
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,390
About to work on the accounts.

278
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,030
Have you seen a G Sesign name card?

279
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,790
Yes, what project do you have in mind?

280
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:50,120
I'll let them renovate the Sunrise bar.

281
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,720
Huh?

282
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,890
Renovate?

283
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,780
Why are we renovating it?

284
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,340
The bar is nice itself.

285
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,870
Yes, it is nice.

286
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,390
But I want to expand it.

287
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:05,640
You know that the customers are coming less and less.

288
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,370
We got a rebranding to do.

289
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:08,610
But...

290
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:12,610
This Monday, I'll make an appointment with G Design, alright?

291
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:17,960
You already look after Sunrise, so help me out with this.

292
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,880
I still have meetings in China...

293
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,480
Dad.

294
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,840
But I've already had a plan to go to Maldives with my friends.

295
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,050
Business or friends, which is more important?

296
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:30,140
You know that our business is slowing down.

297
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,020
That's because you are the one managing it.

298
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:35,110
So I have no choice at all.

299
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,750
I just asked you to go relax with my friends.

300
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,310
Please.

301
00:20:40,310 --> 00:20:41,390
Can't you postpone it?

302
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,550
C'mon.

303
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:46,040
Here's the deal. When I go back, I'll buy you a new car, the latest model.

304
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:49,350
Which series? Don't lure me with a car.

305
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,640
How about you? Flying back and forth. You think you own the airport now or something?

306
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,730
Are you ever here in Thailand 5 days a month?

307
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,980
I just asked you to go hang out with my friends for a week.

308
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,740
Can I not?

309
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,150
Please.

310
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:08,150
I've got a meeting with my partner in China.

311
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:12,800
That's your business. I'll go with my friends no matter what.

312
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:15,400
If you want to do it, do it yourself.

313
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,800
The reason I got you to study in Business Adminis...

314
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:58,130
Oh, Mr. Yai, have you seen Park?

315
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,630
Oh!

316
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,710
Get up!

317
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:07,070
When are you gonna stop being so dumb?

318
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,070
Well...

319
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:18,110
Er...and would you come back to work at the bar around this time, Mr. Yai?

320
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:22,630
I think I'll be working until Friday.

321
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:26,110
Next week, I'm going abroad with my friends.

322
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,280
You guys, don't worry about work.

323
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,810
It will take me just a few days to finish.

324
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,900
Yes, sir.

325
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:48,280
What?

326
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,280
Oh, someone sent us these pics for you to see.

327
00:23:13,630 --> 00:23:15,630
Damn you, Mangkorn!

328
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:32,790
2 days later

329
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,250
Oh, Ajo.

330
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:57,860
How did you get here?

331
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,980
Er...I happened to go see the teacher at the faculty.

332
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:03,740
So I invited a junior to have dinner here.

333
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:07,740
And you, Yai? What got you here?

334
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,020
Well, I...

335
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,540
Did I keep you waiting, AJo?

336
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:26,020
Not at all.

337
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:50,390
Excuse me. The client asks for the revised work file.

338
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:53,390
- That's alright / - That's alright.

339
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:02,450
Er...this is Mangkorn, my junior at the Architecture.

340
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:06,450
And this is Yai, my junior at Business Administration. He used to help me with my thesis too.

341
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:11,290
So now you two know each other.

342
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:16,860
Even we never talked, but I've heard of him.

343
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:23,550
Mr. Alangkarn Singhawattanachok.

344
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,290
The famous heir of an entertainment business.

345
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:29,010
Also, the one of the country's richest families.

346
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:32,330
It's good that you know.

347
00:25:32,330 --> 00:25:34,330
So you'll know who you're talking with now.

348
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,610
Er...

349
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:51,900
So how did you get here, Yai? You haven't answered me that.

350
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:54,430
Are you here with anyone?

351
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,960
No.

352
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,960
Actually, my Dad owns this place.

353
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:05,040
I'm about to graduate, so my Dad has me run this place.

354
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,060
Oh, wow. That's nice.

355
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:11,060
I didn't know that this place is one of your family's businesses.

356
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:14,200
If you'd like to have anything, feel free to order.

357
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:18,890
This meal, it's on me.

358
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:23,360
No need to.

359
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:32,360
Nowadays, when you know someone, you'd better support rather than asking for free food.

360
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:37,690
Well, in that case, Ajo...

361
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:43,610
is someone Yai knows.

362
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:48,540
Let me treat you, Ajo?

363
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,940
Is that okay, Ajo?

364
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,580
Er...I agree.

365
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:57,110
Since we're here, why don't we support your business?

366
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:01,110
And this is also an apology for not going to the movie with you that day too.

367
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:08,510
Er...

368
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:09,510
May I have the menu, please?

369
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:14,750
Thank you.

370
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,710
What's wrong with Mr. Yai?

371
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Yeah, right.

372
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,090
Hey.

373
00:27:46,090 --> 00:27:48,090
Why don't you go ask Mr. Yai?

374
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:54,370
Mr. Yai.

375
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,050
What's this?

376
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:59,940
Medicine for sore throat.

377
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:03,790
Why did you bring it? I didn't want any.

378
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:05,540
And what would you like then, Mr. Yai?

379
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:08,460
That was a secret code! A secret code!

380
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,460
Go on! Hurry!

381
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,460
Yai, are you having anything too?

382
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,900
It's alright.

383
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,990
Ajo, you can check out the recommended menu.

384
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:24,870
Everything is tasty here...

385
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:27,270
So what did Mr. Yai say?

386
00:28:27,270 --> 00:28:29,310
He said it was a secret code.

387
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,770
What secret code?

388
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:32,490
Huh?

389
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:35,410
Code...

390
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:37,250
Oh! The secret code!

391
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,180
Keep it down!

392
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,180
The secret code.

393
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,660
Cheers!

394
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:54,910
Wow, this is so good.

395
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:58,350
Much better than the five-star restaurant that I used to go to.

396
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:00,950
Oh, wow, thank you.

397
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,950
If you like it, then please come here more often.

398
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,720
Er...would you excuse me for a sec?

399
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,610
Today...

400
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:33,610
No hitting on any girls?

401
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:36,010
Hmm...

402
00:29:36,010 --> 00:29:38,450
Such a pity.

403
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,450
I thought I was gonna chill here with Ajo.

404
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:53,590
Turns out that I gotta meet the owner who's having a fierce face like a...

405
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:57,590
tiger.

406
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:08,230
Hey, Park.

407
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:09,280
Mr. Yai did it again.

408
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,080
Go! Go on!

409
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,080
Oh, okay.

410
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:16,180
Guys, I have to get going.

411
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,220
There's been an urgent call.

412
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:19,580
Mangkorn, don't leave just yet.

413
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,620
Keep Yai a company.

414
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,870
Please.

415
00:30:23,870 --> 00:30:26,800
May I have my purse?

416
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:28,550
See you then, Ajo.

417
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,560
I'm so sorry. I'll chill with you guys some other time.

418
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,560
See you.

419
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,600
Park, hurry up!

420
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,600
Right, right. I know.

421
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,650
Are you done?

422
00:31:09,650 --> 00:31:11,250
Man, hold on.

423
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,900
Red or blue?

424
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,270
Hey, faster! Someone might come.

425
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,270
Well, you hold it.

426
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:20,830
Here are two magaritas.

427
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,900
Well, you were awarded, right? Why not just celebrating?

428
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,110
To tonight.

429
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:45,030
Mmm, to tonight.

430
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,280
Give me another one.

431
00:31:57,380 --> 00:31:58,380
Of course.

432
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,250
Watch out.

433
00:32:53,650 --> 00:32:55,650
My gosh, he's heavy.

434
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,400
Over here.

435
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,600
Okay.

436
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
You take that side.

437
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,840
What did you give him?

438
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,130
It took so long

439
00:33:08,130 --> 00:33:09,560
for him to pass out.

440
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,890
Just like you ordered, sir.

441
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,090
Oh, or would you like me to give him more?

442
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:14,220
No need to.

443
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,970
I'll take it from here.

444
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,290
You guys can leave now.

445
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:21,410
Would you like us to wait outside or...

446
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:24,460
Just leave already, wherever.

447
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,460
Go on!

448
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:12,530
You'll sleep for ages.

449
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:51,190
How dare you hit on the girl that I like?

450
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:57,110
Mangkorn, Akira.

451
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,890
A popular one from the Faculty of Architecture.

452
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,890
Everyone likes you, everyone loves you.

453
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:11,970
Well, let's see.

454
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:16,300
What if this video leaks, will you still be loved?

455
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,320
Let go!

456
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,580
Do you think a guy like me can be fooled easily?

457
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:48,580
I'll show you why everyone likes me so much.

458
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:50,950
Let go of me!

459
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,840
You're not so smart as your mouth is.

460
00:35:56,840 --> 00:36:00,570
A guy like me won't lose to a guy like you.

461
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:01,410
Let go!

462
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,410
Damn you!

463
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,700
What?

464
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,000
Shit!

465
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
"Did I screw your brains out last night?"

466
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,050
What's up?

467
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:20,290
Last night...

468
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:21,690
did you have fun?

469
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:23,090
Fun, my ass.

470
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:23,930
Last night was just...

471
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:29,930
You were the one who asked for more, more, more and more, weren't you?

472
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,700
It's been just a few hours ago.

473
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:46,940
How could you not remember?

474
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,050
What a shame!

475
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,900
Stop talking.

476
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,370
And forget about last night.

477
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:53,770
How could I?

478
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:56,690
It was the hottest night of us two.

479
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:00,690
You could make a sexy face?

480
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,980
I thought you could only make a fierce face.

481
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:10,310
But in the video that you got, there's your face too.

482
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,510
I could always censor my face.

483
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,030
Don't be so stupid.

484
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:16,200
Can't you come up with that?

485
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,200
You know, what you did was horrible.

486
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,530
But I was onto it.

487
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,530
Listen to me now.

488
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:29,370
No matter what you do,

489
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:32,570
you're never going to beat me.

490
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,850
And about last night,

491
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:36,850
You won't be able to forget it.

492
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,200
Hello? Hello?

493
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,700
Dad! I'm going to renovate the bar!

494
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,160
G Design is ready, Mr. Yai.

495
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,630
What are you doing?

496
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:11,110
You didn't look at my foot.

497
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:13,630
You didn't tell me that you were gonna kick.

498
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,670
Your clumsiness is one thing.

499
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:17,990
We've known each other for almost twenty years.

500
00:42:17,990 --> 00:42:19,980
When are you gonna stop being like this?

501
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:20,910
Why do you always complain?

502
00:42:21,430 --> 00:42:23,430
Just hold on to the mitts, I'll knee strike.

503
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:27,430
Alright, got it.

504
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,270
Oh, yeah.

505
00:42:32,270 --> 00:42:35,830
Last night, we left Mr. Yai alone,

506
00:42:35,830 --> 00:42:37,790
would that be okay?

507
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:41,390
How would it not be okay? I gave that guy the whole tube of anesthetic.

508
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:45,390
Which color did you give him?

509
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:46,390
Red, of course.

510
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:53,840
Hey, hurry up! Someone might come.

511
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,640
Hold on, I'm putting it in.

512
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:59,520
C'mon, don't worry.

513
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,240
I put it in twice.

514
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:02,390
Hey, c'mon, did you get it?

515
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,390
Yeah, you just watch out.

516
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,620
Which one?

517
00:43:08,790 --> 00:43:09,790
This one.

518
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:15,270
What's wrong?

519
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:18,830
Hey!

520
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:20,480
Hey! What's wrong?

521
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,290
Hey!

522
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:24,290
Are you alright?

523
00:43:28,530 --> 00:43:29,690
I was in the shower,

524
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,740
and I fell on the roll-on deodorant.

525
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:31,420
Huh?

526
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,420
G Design is ready, Mr. Yai.

527
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:38,990
No matter how much money you have,

528
00:43:38,990 --> 00:43:40,910
the warmth in the family

529
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:42,590
is also important.

530
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:43,590
Please excuse me.

531
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,760
Delete the video clip,

532
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:50,680
or you'll get in trouble.

533
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,200
Why should I?

534
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,200
That video clip is so hot.
