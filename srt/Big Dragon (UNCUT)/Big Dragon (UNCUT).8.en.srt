2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:08,010
Can I hit on you again?

3
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:09,390
I guess.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,600
I wish you luck.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,820
Mangkorn and I aren't a thing.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:15,320
Yet.

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,320
Please be my partner.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,490
What if we both hadn't met at the bar that night,...

9
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:28,020
do you think we would have gotten to this point?

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:29,150
I don't know.

11
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,400
I'll have to find a way to get to you anyway.

12
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:35,400
Because you are the only one in my heart.

13
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:40,550
You've been accepted to the TS-ACT 2022 project in the United States of America.

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,120
Oh.

15
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,400
Certainly.

16
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,850
Let's confirm it on Sunday.

17
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,250
Yes.

18
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,250
Goodbye.

19
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:17,710
The student accepted to the TS-ACT 2022,
scholarship of Master in Architecture in the United States of Ameica,
Akira Chitsanupongkul, representative of Thailand.

20
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,690
It's Arjo.

21
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,820
You've been accepted to the TS-ACT 2022 project in the United States of America.
Please contact your institution within 3...

22
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,820
What is it?

23
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,530
What is this?

24
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:19,320
Well...

25
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,820
I got the scholarship to do a master's in New York.

26
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:24,590
The thing is...

27
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,230
I don't wanna go too

28
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,230
if I knew that we'd end up like this...

29
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,690
When I handed in the documents,

30
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,690
I just...wanted to run away from the family problems.

31
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,700
But I've thought about it...

32
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,750
If you're not okay,

33
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:59,130
I'm not going.

34
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,140
When are you leaving?

35
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:22,029
The end of this month.

36
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,480
Please move there with me.

37
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,650
We can be there together, please.

38
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,180
How can I go, Mangkorn?

39
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,180
I have to take care of the bar.

40
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:53,820
But if you consider this opportunity,

41
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:59,760
I'll come back and have a good career and make a living out of it.

42
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,530
That's right.

43
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:10,790
Your dream...

44
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,790
is also my happiness.

45
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:20,040
And is there a reason...

46
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,040
I shouldn't let you go?

47
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,520
Hey.

48
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:55,970
I'm okay.

49
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,600
I can live with that.

50
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,660
It's not a big deal.

51
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,540
I'm alright.

52
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,120
That's not true.

53
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,210
You're lying.

54
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,690
No, I'm not.

55
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,740
I've told you.

56
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:36,960
Your happiness...

57
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,960
is also my happiness.

58
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,210
No, Yai.

59
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,450
You can be mad at me.

60
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,460
You can hit me.

61
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,980
You...

62
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,590
You can do anything...

63
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,490
but please don't be so cold.

64
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,230
No.

65
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
I'm not like that anymore.

66
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
Yai.

67
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,010
Ying.

68
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:02,290
Come to me.

69
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,560
Be good, kids.

70
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,340
Don't be stubborn.

71
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,620
Don't be naughty.

72
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,540
You must listen to your Dad.

73
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,140
Understood?

74
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,580
And whom will I go to the beach with?

75
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:44,670
Mom, stay with me.

76
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,420
Don't leave me.

77
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:48,710
Mom.

78
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:08,590
Yai.

79
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,240
Yai.

80
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,130
Yai, son.

81
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:17,650
Are you alright?

82
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,150
You're drifting.

83
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,530
I'm alright.

84
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,260
Please excuse me.

85
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,290
I'll go with Auntie Li.

86
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:06,230
You were the one who put these white asters here?

87
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,280
Yes.

88
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:15,380
They are the flowers I bought for your Mom when we were in uni.

89
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:21,030
They represent care and determination.

90
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:31,120
You know, your Mom wasn't easy to get.

91
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,370
In the past, she was a hottie.

92
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:39,770
But I don't know why she chose me.

93
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:46,170
Maybe it's because I kept hitting on here everyday.

94
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:55,420
Do you miss her, Dad?

95
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
I do.

96
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,510
I always do.

97
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,840
I don't know how she's doing now.

98
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,140
Anyway, what made you cry so badly?

99
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,640
Is there something on your mind?

100
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,580
You can tell me everything.

101
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,610
Dad.

102
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:07,780
I just realized

103
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,300
that no matter if we parted alive or dead,

104
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,830
it's a torture all the same.

105
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,040
Life's like this, son.

106
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,530
No one's gonna live with us forever.

107
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:33,860
And we'll never know what the future holds.

108
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,620
Yai, you must be strong.

109
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,190
Just like your Mom.

110
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,510
You can date Auntie Li.

111
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,960
I want you to be happy.

112
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:11,340
Mom would think so too.

113
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,880
Don't know how Dad and Mom are doing now.

114
00:15:33,950 --> 00:15:35,950
Mmm, that's true.

115
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,240
Right, Park.

116
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,890
If you're not a bodyguard,

117
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,890
is there anything else you'd like to do?

118
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:51,580
Mmm, there is.

119
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:59,260
When you're free, I'd like to invite you to see my Grandma out of town.

120
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:20,010
Hello, Mangkorn.

121
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,790
I'm on the motorway now.

122
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,290
What are you doing?

123
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,150
I'm still packing in my room.

124
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,640
Oh, you haven't finished that?

125
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:31,090
I thought you have since last week.

126
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:33,010
Just a few stuff left.

127
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:36,010
And...is there anything, Ma?

128
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,580
Well...

129
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:42,270
I've spoken with your Pa...about Hong.

130
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,680
He seemed to be okay with it.

131
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,220
When you're on school break and back to Thailand,

132
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,390
come and have a talk with him.

133
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:54,670
Oh, really? And...

134
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,050
Is he really okay with it, Ma?

135
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,140
Yes.

136
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,350
Can I ask you something?

137
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,240
Now that your problems are solved...

138
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
do you still wanna go study abroad?

139
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,520
Well,...

140
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,880
doing master's...

141
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,010
has always been my dream since I was little.

142
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,830
If it's gonna make my life better,

143
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,340
I wanna go.

144
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,240
Oh, Ma.

145
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,240
I'll...continue packing now.

146
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,240
I don't want it to be done so late.

147
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,090
I wanna play that!

148
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:27,290
Why?

149
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:30,260
Don't you know that this machine robs everyone?

150
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,260
Ah!

151
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,710
There.

152
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,390
Do you like it?

153
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,690
Yes.

154
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,210
Right, it's so hot today.

155
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:14,280
Oh!

156
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,250
Hey, guys!

157
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,260
There's a new movie showing.

158
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
Wanna go?

159
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:22,990
My treat!

160
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,880
Is it the one you showed us yesterday?

161
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,880
Yep, that one.

162
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:27,970
I'll check the showtime.

163
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:28,850
Mmm.

164
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,330
Right.

165
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,020
Where is it?

166
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,020
Here!

167
00:19:32,950 --> 00:19:33,950
There's one showing at 7 p.m.

168
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
So I'll buy the tickets?

169
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:36,890
Yeah, go ahead.

170
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:38,780
Yai.

171
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:39,820
Are you coming with us?

172
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:41,630
Yai!

173
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,080
Yai!

174
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,360
Are you coming with us?

175
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:46,020
Huh?

176
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,020
Are you coming with us?

177
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,430
So what do you say?

178
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,720
You ditched us so many times already.

179
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,250
Mmm.

180
00:19:58,610 --> 00:20:01,810
mangkorn_x69: Can you come see me?

181
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,520
mangkorn_x69: The flight leaves at 8 p.m.

182
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,180
Thought you weren't coming.

183
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,300
Thank you for coming.

184
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,910
The plane's about to take off in 40 minutes.

185
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,720
You didn't forget anything, right?

186
00:21:22,890 --> 00:21:24,890
I have some stuff to give you.

187
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,760
It's at my place.

188
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,930
Why are you giving me?

189
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,920
Just...

190
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,870
don't forget to fetch it.

191
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,190
You still got the keys, right?

192
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,340
Don't worry...

193
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,520
that I'll be mad at you.

194
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,960
Because if I were to be mad at you,

195
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,960
I would've been since that night.

196
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yai.

197
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,980
Yai.

198
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,680
Well, last month...

199
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,560
when we weren't a couple yet,

200
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:47,930
I signed up for the master's program in New York.

201
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:55,970
That time...

202
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,690
I just wanted to clear my family problem off.

203
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,700
Honestly,

204
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:07,470
I was trying to run away from the problem.

205
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:15,950
But right now, I'm very scared.

206
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,550
Because of what you told me,

207
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,880
if there's any problem, just talk to each other openly.

208
00:23:32,050 --> 00:23:34,050
Well, I'm a coward.

209
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,900
Even now...

210
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:46,550
I don't have the guts.

211
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,240
But if I get it,

212
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,810
please don't be mad at me.

213
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,060
When you were talking,

214
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,900
I was listening.

215
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,140
With that,

216
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:49,740
you have so many things to be concerned about already.

217
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,690
To you,

218
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,660
I must be very bad.

219
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,990
I always make you cry.

220
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,880
Being with me must have been very awful, right?

221
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,340
What makes you think that?

222
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,230
You...

223
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,320
you're very good.

224
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:46,630
You made me...

225
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,200
become a better person.

226
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,320
These past two months

227
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,500
are very significant to me.

228
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,900
I can't believe that...

229
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:15,910
two guys like us...

230
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,510
could end up together like this.

231
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,980
For everything that's happened,

232
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,820
you don't have to forgive me.

233
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,900
Because I won't apologize for anything anymore.

234
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:23,660
Please let me remember all of this.

235
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:31,050
Even it'd hurt me, make me happy or miserable,

236
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,890
it's okay.

237
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
Because the one in my memory is you,

238
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,820
the only person I love.

239
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,220
Maybe...

240
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,870
the day that fireflies fly here again,

241
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,350
you and I might become friends already.

242
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,850
Take care of yourself.

243
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,330
Safe flight, honey.

244
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,080
I'll be rooting for you.

245
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:50,190
Don't forget to give me a call when you get to New York.

246
00:29:50,870 --> 00:29:51,870
I will.

247
00:29:59,890 --> 00:30:01,890
Come here. Let me give you a hug.

248
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,540
Take a good care of yourself. You're a grown up now.

249
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,550
I will.

250
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:06,670
Call us a lot, would you?

251
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,670
I will.

252
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:15,480
I'm off, Ma.

253
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,480
Can I give you another hug?

254
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,720
Come on, he needs to go.

255
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:21,870
I gotta go, Ma.

256
00:30:21,870 --> 00:30:23,000
Or I'll miss the flight.

257
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Alright.

258
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
Safe trip, honey.

259
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:27,930
Don't forget to call me!

260
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,220
I will.

261
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:56,080
"I know you wanted this."

262
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,530
I couldn't buy a skateboard for Mr. Yai in time.

263
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:01,530
What? Why are you blaming me?

264
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:14,490
"Wear this."

265
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:54,980
What are you doing?

266
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,300
Again!

267
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,989
Hello, this is Akira Chitsanupongkul...

268
00:34:22,989 --> 00:34:26,679
or the handsome Mangkorn.

269
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:29,679
Today, I got something to tell you.

270
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,880
I just asked Yai to be my boyfriend.

271
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:38,489
And this is my boyfriend.

272
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,070
What are you doing?

273
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,570
C'mon, get in the frame.

274
00:34:44,170 --> 00:34:47,170
You tell them that you're mine.

275
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,260
Right.

276
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,360
Right, what?

277
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,239
Well, right means right.

278
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,530
Right about what?

279
00:34:58,940 --> 00:34:59,940
Well, I am.

280
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,300
Yes, we are a couple now.

281
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,300
I love him very much.

282
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:11,520
What are you recording?

283
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,670
I'm recording this so everyone would see.

284
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:15,340
Looks like it's dying.

285
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:17,590
I could never grow any plants.

286
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,390
What's his name?

287
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:19,240
Somchai.

288
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:21,810
Oh, his name is Somchai, everyone.

289
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,340
Hey.

290
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,690
You're filming me?

291
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:25,610
Let me see it.

292
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:26,660
Can I see it?

293
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,980
Oh, there's a bee.

294
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,690
So adorable!

295
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:31,690
Oh.

296
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,080
Wow, that seems hot.

297
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,520
Some awful memories...

298
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:44,640
can't be erased.

299
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,640
But in the end, life must go on.

300
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:52,700
A life that dares to choose something,

301
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,910
without hesitation...

302
00:36:53,910 --> 00:36:55,400
Hey, Yai!

303
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,410
I'm sorry I'm late.

304
00:36:57,410 --> 00:37:00,410
I stopped by to buy you some flowers.

305
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,650
Here.

306
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,540
You like them?

307
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,140
Thank you.

308
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:24,790
So...

309
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:27,790
that you want to see me today, is there anything?

310
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:30,570
Well,...

311
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:35,240
I have an important thing to tell you.

312
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,350
Mmm.

313
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,520
I've been thinking for a while...

314
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:48,290
Nine, you're the person I'm very comfortable with.

315
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,770
But...

316
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:53,770
you do know...

317
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:58,550
how I feel about you, right?

318
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,330
Mmm.

319
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:22,780
I do.

320
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,790
You've been waiting for me for quite some time.

321
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:35,790
Are you hungry?

322
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,680
Some things happen in your life.

323
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:43,170
And we cannot control them.

324
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,720
You'll never know who's gonna walk into your life.

325
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:50,250
Or how many that will walk out of it.

326
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:02,860
mangkorn_x69: What are you doing?

327
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:08,420
yyaiwtn: I'm trading POPCOINs. Got so many coins.

328
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:12,550
mangkorn_x69: Buy me a meal next time you see me.

329
00:39:12,550 --> 00:39:17,400
mangkorn_x69: I miss you.

330
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,900
mangkorn_x69: Gotta get to the class now. I'm running late.

331
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,290
yyaiwtn: Can I call you?

332
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:02,290
mangkorn_x69: I'm pretty busy, I'll call you back.

333
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:22,150
Here, Yai.

334
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,200
Happy birthday!

335
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,480
Thank you.

336
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,470
Eat till you can't anymore.

337
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:36,470
It's on me!

338
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:45,530
Happy birthday, Yai.

339
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:56,760
Nine.

340
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,930
Hey.

341
00:40:57,930 --> 00:40:58,930
Yai.

342
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:01,730
I almost missed you.

343
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:07,230
You wouldn't because I would wait no matter what.

344
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,380
Take a good care of yourself when I'm not around.

345
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:14,250
Understood?

346
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:15,510
You too.

347
00:41:16,030 --> 00:41:17,530
Take care of yourself.

348
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,520
I will.

349
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,530
Right, don't forget to buy me lots of snacks!

350
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,780
Okay.

351
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:49,970
In the end, all we can do is facing our problem,

352
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,640
and move on, to the light at the end of the tunnel.

353
00:41:57,130 --> 00:42:00,460
Though it may be a little spark of light,

354
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,790
like fireflies,

355
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:06,790
it may be the light of the last hope

356
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,610
that brings us the new life.

357
00:43:01,490 --> 00:43:02,490
Good evening, everyone!

358
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,420
How are you all doing?

359
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:07,100
It's been almost a year.

360
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:10,470
Sunrise bar is now renovated!

361
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,880
Yay!

362
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:17,380
And it's now rebranded to...The New Sunrise!

363
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:20,750
Bravo, bravo!

364
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,770
Today, I've invited all my special guests here...

365
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,420
to celebrate and be happy with...

366
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,990
this coming 2023!

367
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:33,870
Wow!

368
00:43:33,870 --> 00:43:36,870
Here we go!

369
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,360
Everyone, clink the glasses!

370
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,360
Cheers!

371
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:49,490
And who here doesn't have the glass yet, please take one at the back.

372
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,580
Let's have a blast tonight!

373
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:59,020
Congratulations, Yai!

374
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,870
The new bar is elegant!

375
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:04,120
Wow.

376
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,080
You're exaggerating!

377
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,450
Hold on, are you underaged?

378
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:10,410
Now, you're exaggerating!

379
00:44:10,410 --> 00:44:11,740
Of course not!

380
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:13,500
I'm just playing.

381
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:16,060
Haven't seen you in a long time, Yai. Doing good?

382
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:19,220
Yes, I'm doing good. And you, Hong? Good?

383
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:20,980
I'm good.

384
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:22,980
Alright, let's clink the glasses.

385
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,820
Hey, Yai! Congrats!

386
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:33,510
C'mon!

387
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:34,510
Cheers!

388
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,110
Cheers!

389
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:38,630
Bottoms up!

390
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,320
Da: Congrats! I'll go see you when I'm in Bangkok.

391
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,530
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

392
00:44:48,730 --> 00:44:50,540
Hey, how could you not finish the drink?

393
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,740
Wow.

394
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,020
Drink up, man, everyone else finished the drinks!

395
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,020
Yeah, take a look.

396
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,700
Hey, excuse me.

397
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:56,700
Okay.

398
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:03,070
Oh, Hello, Mr. Yai.

399
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:04,070
Hello, Mr. Rat.

400
00:45:05,950 --> 00:45:07,950
How's it? The renovated bar, do you like it?

401
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,040
I love it.

402
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:12,690
I must thank you, Mr. Rat

403
00:45:12,690 --> 00:45:14,690
for coming here tonight.

404
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:17,940
Make yourself at home.

405
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,000
Cheers!

406
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:30,940
Yai.

407
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,270
Hey, Arjo.

408
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:34,600
Congratulations to you!

409
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:35,770
Thank you very much.

410
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,080
Beautiful flowers!

411
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:40,750
But I don't know if these are as beautiful as you...

412
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,000
Park. Pong!

413
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,050
If it weren't for you, the bar wouldn't be finished.

414
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:49,350
You're too kind.

415
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:52,090
Please keep these flowers.

416
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:57,140
Those are beautiful. Who gave them to you?

417
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,240
Oh, the lavenders?

418
00:46:06,090 --> 00:46:08,590
It's from Nine. He sends them every month.

419
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:12,210
Nine?

420
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:14,220
Yes.

421
00:47:39,610 --> 00:47:41,110
Why didn't you tell me that you're back?

422
00:47:42,330 --> 00:47:43,330
Why should I?

423
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:45,640
I wanted it to be a surprise.

424
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,680
And it's the school break too.

425
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:51,830
So I just come back.

426
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:55,790
And...

427
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,620
why is that room still there?

428
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:01,110
I thought you were gonna turn in into the restroom.

429
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,250
I wanted the same room.

430
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,120
Mmm.

431
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:54,340
Right, about the flowers, what's that all about?

432
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:03,920
They're from me.

433
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:05,250
Ahhh.

434
00:49:06,730 --> 00:49:08,730
And you dared leave them for Nine to send them over.

435
00:49:09,210 --> 00:49:11,710
Well, I didn't know who I should leave them with.

436
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,500
And...how did you manage to talk to Nine?

437
00:49:16,910 --> 00:49:18,910
Why would he do this?

438
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:22,390
Well...

439
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,360
Well, what?

440
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:32,980
The thing is...

441
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:36,710
will it be too much...

442
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,920
if I'd like to ask for a favor?

443
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:46,440
What do you have in mind?

444
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:55,650
Can you give these to Yai?

445
00:49:57,460 --> 00:49:59,460
Why don't you do that yourself?

446
00:50:01,990 --> 00:50:02,990
Well,...

447
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:09,560
With all this, I must have botherd Yai so much.

448
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:29,320
Then...

449
00:50:32,410 --> 00:50:34,410
before you fly to New York,

450
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,860
go talk to Yai.

451
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:42,070
Don't leave things hanging.

452
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:43,800
I will.

453
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:48,040
But...

454
00:50:49,330 --> 00:50:50,830
don't tell Yai.

455
00:50:53,700 --> 00:50:54,700
I understand.

456
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,470
Hey, Yai!

457
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,920
I'm sorry I'm late.

458
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:02,930
I stopped by to buy you some flowers.

459
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,300
Well...

460
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:12,790
I was far away from you.

461
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:17,000
Nine...

462
00:51:17,850 --> 00:51:19,850
was around you the whole time.

463
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:23,710
So I had him do it for me.

464
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:26,670
You're unbelievable.

465
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,900
If I'm not unbelievable, not unpredictable,

466
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:34,860
then it's not Mangkorn.

467
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:38,630
So...

468
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:42,400
we haven't met in a year...

469
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,920
do you still love me?

470
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:56,360
If I don't, I wouldn't get into the car with you.

471
00:52:01,510 --> 00:52:03,510
If you do, just say so.

472
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:06,320
Why do you have to be tight-lipped?

473
00:52:06,870 --> 00:52:07,870
Right.

474
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:09,320
I love you.

475
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,160
Huh?

476
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,000
What was that?

477
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:15,450
I love you.

478
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:16,800
Are you deaf?

479
00:52:26,460 --> 00:52:28,460
There's nothing wrong with your lips.

480
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:32,390
They're still soft as they were.

481
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:40,800
Now that I see you,

482
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,920
it reminds me of the first time we had a talk together.

483
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,040
I was very happy then.

484
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:54,970
Mmm.

485
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:56,650
Me too.

486
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:10,860
The moon is beautiful.

487
00:53:15,540 --> 00:53:17,540
When I spoke of the school break,...

488
00:53:19,750 --> 00:53:21,050
I mean I won't be going back to school anymore.

489
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,560
Huh?

490
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:25,440
What's wrong?

491
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:29,450
I want to stay here with you.

492
00:53:30,170 --> 00:53:31,170
And one more thing,

493
00:53:31,940 --> 00:53:33,940
I've been meaning to clear things off with my family.

494
00:53:35,350 --> 00:53:37,350
I can't be running away from the problem like this forever.

495
00:53:39,160 --> 00:53:40,360
Well, if you want to clear off the problem,

496
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:41,880
I get it.

497
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:44,720
But isn't it a pretty bad timing?

498
00:53:44,770 --> 00:53:45,770
How so?

499
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:49,560
I'm working on the exchange.

500
00:53:50,910 --> 00:53:51,910
And I'm also applying for a job at...

501
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,020
I'm moving to the states with you.

502
00:53:57,490 --> 00:53:58,490
Hey.

503
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:00,540
Are you for real?

504
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:02,860
Mmm.

505
00:54:03,590 --> 00:54:05,190
I've finished taking care of my Dad's bar.

506
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:07,980
When you finish your master's,

507
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,020
we can move back to Thailand.

508
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:21,450
So that means we're gonna be together, right?

509
00:54:22,210 --> 00:54:23,210
Is that right?

510
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:24,880
Mmm.

511
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:27,410
If you talk too much, I'll change my mind.

512
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:30,620
You can't.

513
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,100
You can't take back what you said.

514
00:54:34,790 --> 00:54:36,790
Then, I'll stay at your place for now.

515
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,280
I'll be holding you day and night.

516
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,320
Pay me the rent!

517
00:54:47,010 --> 00:54:49,510
How much would you like?

518
00:54:49,690 --> 00:54:50,690
Naughty!

519
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:52,420
You want me to punch you?

520
00:54:53,590 --> 00:54:54,590
No, I don't.

521
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,360
Who would dare challenge his wife?

522
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:04,280
Let go.

523
00:55:14,150 --> 00:55:15,150
Wait for me.

524
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:28,510
It's very cold there.

525
00:55:28,970 --> 00:55:32,010
I had to wear a coat almost everyday.

526
00:55:32,010 --> 00:55:36,010
Really? It's very hot in Thailand.

527
00:55:36,730 --> 00:55:38,730
I really wanna go there as fast as possible.

528
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:43,160
When you get there, I'll take you to the steak place.

529
00:55:44,230 --> 00:55:45,230
Very tasty.

530
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:47,510
Alright.

531
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,900
You've been bragging all night.

532
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:51,750
Just take me there, alright?

533
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:00,890
Here comes the sunrise.

534
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:06,550
Sunrise means the sun is coming up.

535
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:15,100
Akira also means the sun.

536
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:16,230
Really?

537
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:19,080
Why have I never known that?

538
00:56:24,520 --> 00:56:25,520
See?

539
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:27,050
At last,

540
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:31,130
I took you here to see the sunrise.

541
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,500
It's very beautiful, isn't it?

542
00:56:41,060 --> 00:56:42,060
So...

543
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,300
what is our story going to be?

544
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:50,430
I don't know.

545
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:52,280
Don't think about it.

546
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:53,680
You'll have a headache.

547
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:10,890
Just having you here by my side,

548
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:15,490
I'm very happy.

549
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:23,860
Haven't seen you in a year.

550
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:27,470
Can I give you a smooch?

551
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,320
No.

552
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
You've been on the plane for hours.

553
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:33,400
You haven't brushed your teeth!

554
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:35,050
Your breath stinks!

555
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:36,530
Can I give you a smooch?

556
00:57:36,530 --> 00:57:37,060
No!

557
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:37,710
C'mon.

558
00:57:37,710 --> 00:57:38,190
Please.

559
00:57:38,510 --> 00:57:39,280
Please, please, please.

560
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,280
No!

561
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:47,560
Smooch me.

562
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:49,330
No!

563
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:52,110
Hurry up! Hurry up!

564
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:54,420
C'mon.

565
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:55,420
No!

566
00:58:02,230 --> 00:58:04,230
Now, that made my day.

567
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:10,930
In the end, we don't know how the future will turn out.

568
00:58:10,930 --> 00:58:18,300
- There may be good or bad things happen to you when you least expect it.
-...C'mon, that's enough...

569
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,350
But believe me,

570
00:58:20,350 --> 00:58:23,510
after the storm of life is gone,

571
00:58:23,510 --> 00:58:28,600
you will see the empowering light...

572
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,600
that helps you overcome every problem you face.

573
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:21,320
Who would that be?

574
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:37,290
Who are you?

575
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:40,820
Er...and who are you?

576
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:53,060
Hey, Tao (Turtle)

577
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:55,150
How did you get here?

578
00:59:55,840 --> 00:59:56,840
Yai!
