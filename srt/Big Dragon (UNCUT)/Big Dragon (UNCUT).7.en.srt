2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:08,940
We just had a fight for a few days...

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,620
and then you kissed somebody else?

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:12,310
Stop fighting it, Mangkorn.

5
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,870
What should I do, Mom?

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,760
There are so many problems now.

7
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,350
If I were away for a few years,

8
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,950
would everything get better, Ma?

9
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:23,480
But you know, right?

10
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,080
Doing that is running away from the problem...

11
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,320
What if I change my mind and not go,

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,210
could that be possible?

13
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:30,600
Yai.

14
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,009
Yai? Is it?

15
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,360
Think of me as another mother of yours, alright?

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,740
Are you okay, dear?

17
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:42,240
Some things—it's not that we can't choose;

18
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,280
it's just that we don't dare choose.

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:51,670
Hello, Park, where are you?

20
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,350
We're here, Mr. Yai.

21
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,430
Where did you park?

22
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,350
In front of the building as always.

23
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:59,850
Hey, there they are, Park and Pong.

24
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,140
Guys, I'm off.

25
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:17,660
Alright.

26
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,380
See ya.

27
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:18,980
See you.

28
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:19,620
Later, man.

29
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:20,320
Later, later.

30
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,230
Yai.

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
I like you.

32
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,960
And...

33
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,870
I won't let you run away anymore.

34
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,630
Ride with me.

35
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,880
Come with me.

36
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,900
Then, hurry up.

37
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,410
Hey, where are you going?

38
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,180
Why did you do that?

39
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:08,550
Did what?

40
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,070
The kiss.

41
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,370
Didn't you feel embarrased?

42
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:15,370
Why should I?

43
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,279
You're my wife.

44
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,690
Who's your wife?

45
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,710
Can you listen to my answer now?

46
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,670
No.

47
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,130
Are you playing hard to get?

48
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,670
I'll kiss you again then.

49
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:36,900
Hey!

50
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,630
What do you want to say?

51
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,710
Oh, now you know how to listen?

52
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Are you gonna say it?

53
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:53,770
I just want to tell you that...

54
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:57,770
Hong and I aren't a thing.

55
00:04:58,330 --> 00:04:59,330
You got it all wrong.

56
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,260
Yeah?

57
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:03,930
Mmm.

58
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,210
But you and that guy...

59
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,490
Who?

60
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:17,930
Nine?

61
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,100
Yeah.

62
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,980
The one who kissed you.

63
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,030
I saw it.

64
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,980
Well...

65
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,540
Hong's Pa and my Pa,...

66
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:50,540
they've been best friends since primary school to uni.

67
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:55,220
So they made a deal.

68
00:05:56,970 --> 00:05:58,970
If they were to have children, they'd pair them up.

69
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,420
That's why my name is Mangkorn.

70
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,880
And her name is Hong.

71
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,730
What should I do to make you believe me?

72
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,930
What should I do?

73
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:27,120
Please believe me.

74
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,160
What should I do?

75
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:36,270
Alright, I believe you.

76
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,690
Do you really?

77
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,700
So you're not mad at me now?

78
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,380
Right? You're not mad at me?

79
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,060
Please don't be mad at me. Please, please, please.

80
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,020
Don't be mad at me, please.

81
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,020
Well, I'm not mad at you!

82
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,820
It doesn't seem like you're not.

83
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,910
Alright.

84
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:03,910
I'm not mad at you anymore!

85
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,150
It's good that you're not mad anymore.

86
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,310
Because I will be mad at you.

87
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,800
So...

88
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,800
With Nine, what is it between you two?

89
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,480
Nine is a senior from school.

90
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,980
He just got back from England.

91
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,480
You like him, don't you?

92
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,680
That kiss was so passionate.

93
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:48,650
You've fallen for him, haven't you?

94
00:08:01,010 --> 00:08:04,530
If you like him, it's your business.

95
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:07,730
But...

96
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:09,730
he can't take you away from me.

97
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,370
Really?

98
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,080
Let go!

99
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,200
Right.

100
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,710
How could I share this cutie with anyone?

101
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,710
Damn, that hurts!

102
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,440
So you'll remember...

103
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,470
and you won't go flirting with anyone else again.

104
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,470
Why? Are you jealous?

105
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:34,590
Who's jealous?

106
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,380
Who?

107
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:43,620
You are. You're being very suspicious.

108
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:45,890
Yai.

109
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,640
Can I hit on you again?

110
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,650
Huh?

111
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:00,290
Can I hit on you?

112
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,170
Huh? What?

113
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:03,930
I couldn't hear you.

114
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,210
Can I hit on you again?

115
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:09,940
I guess.

116
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,460
I wish you luck.

117
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,140
Alright.

118
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,630
Just wait and see.

119
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,660
Don't fall in love with me.

120
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,540
There, I saw it.

121
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,300
What?

122
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,910
It was less than 5 seconds and you smiled.

123
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:29,320
You've already fallen in love with me, right?

124
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,320
Whoa, you're so over yourself.

125
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,390
There's a thunder.

126
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:38,620
Hey, here come the clouds.

127
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:41,190
Let's head back. Let's go.

128
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,780
Give me a chance, would you?

129
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:21,540
Yai.

130
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,550
Mmm.

131
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:41,890
Take me there.

132
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,650
You can walk yourself. You got legs.

133
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:44,530
C'mon.

134
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,530
No, walk!

135
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:05,800
Stop it!

136
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
What?

137
00:12:51,450 --> 00:12:52,790
It's so beautiful here.

138
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,370
Mmm.

139
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,030
I've been meaning to ask you for a long time.

140
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,030
Why is your name Mangkorn?

141
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,070
Before, my Ma wasn't healthy.

142
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:09,430
It was hard for her to get pregnant.

143
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,270
My Pa and Ma came here for a blessing.

144
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,830
So they would have children.

145
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,390
One month passed, and my Ma got pregnant.

146
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,270
Wow.

147
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:19,700
So they named me Mangkorn.

148
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,910
And this...

149
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,480
Wow, that's quite a story.

150
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,480
I'm serious. I'm not joking.

151
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,370
Then, why don't you ask for a blessing?

152
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,920
In case we'll have kids together.

153
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,200
Ha!

154
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,200
You're shy, aren't you?

155
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,960
What?

156
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,640
Why did you bring it?

157
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,720
Are you gonna blackmail me?

158
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,720
Hey, could you think positively for once?

159
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,680
I brought it to take beautiful views

160
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,280
and handsome me.

161
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,280
Can you take a video of me too?

162
00:13:57,710 --> 00:13:59,710
Hey, there's no memory disk.

163
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,870
Memory disk?

164
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,870
Man, did I forget to bring it?

165
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,410
Shit, I didn't bring it.

166
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,850
Here. Memory disk.

167
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:13,850
Huh?

168
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:15,650
You have it on you?

169
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,660
Yeah.

170
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,500
Who would have a memory disk on them?

171
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,930
A person like me.

172
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:22,730
Hey.

173
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:24,020
But this is your memory disk.

174
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:26,220
Oh, I told you to throw it away.

175
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,220
This still works. Why should I throw it away?

176
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,620
Hey, look!

177
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:44,200
Hey, you're filming me?

178
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,900
Did I make a dumb face?

179
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,370
Hey, let me see it.

180
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,580
C'mon, let me see it!

181
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,330
And, we got Mangkorn here.

182
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,110
That's funny.

183
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:18,530
Well, how should I tell my Pa?

184
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,870
He will scold for sure.

185
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,510
I can't find a job.

186
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:27,430
And there are so many jobless people out there.

187
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:31,430
Man, what should I do? How should I tell him? Where would I find a job?

188
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:32,830
What should I do?

189
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:35,070
Stop, stop, stop, stop it right there!

190
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:39,070
Look, you're so stresssed that your face looks awful.

191
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:40,420
My face is awful?

192
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,220
Yeah.

193
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,220
No, no, what should I do?

194
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:54,940
I thought you were gonna put that on me.

195
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:57,300
Well, I picked it up to do that for you.

196
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,580
Hey, but I've already have make up on.

197
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,580
You can apply this over during the day.

198
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:06,099
It's very light.

199
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:08,950
Am I pretty yet?

200
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:09,910
Yes, you are.

201
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:10,910
Let me see.

202
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,800
Hey, I do look pretty.

203
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,790
Here, let me put some make up on for you.

204
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,300
It's messy now.

205
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,290
No, it's not!

206
00:17:26,290 --> 00:17:27,290
Here. Over here.

207
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,350
Hey, Nadear.

208
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:33,690
Yai!

209
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:36,920
There!

210
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,860
Don't tell me that...

211
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:41,100
you two...

212
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:45,100
No, we're not.

213
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,470
You can tell?

214
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,780
Wow, I haven't even finished my sentence.

215
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,490
You already told me everything.

216
00:17:56,490 --> 00:18:00,170
Oh, did I?

217
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:02,570
You didn't tell me you were a couple.

218
00:18:02,570 --> 00:18:04,570
I was so upset before.

219
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:09,300
Well, you too, Yai!

220
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:13,300
I saw what happened yesterday in front of the building.

221
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,380
Stop it!

222
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:23,220
Here's the thing, Mangkorn and I aren't a thing.

223
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,220
Huh?

224
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,740
Tell them.

225
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,500
We aren't a thing.

226
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,730
See?

227
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:35,730
Yet.

228
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,610
Oh.

229
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:46,810
Next year, our Pas will throw us a wedding ceremony.

230
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,420
But...

231
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:51,920
I think I've found the way out of this.

232
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:55,830
How so?

233
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,260
Yai, don't you worry about Hong's Pa.

234
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,260
I'll handle it.

235
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:07,420
Honestly, I thought I was gonna tell you a long time ago.

236
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,640
But don't you worry, Yai.

237
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:13,400
No matter what, Mangkorn and I are just friends.

238
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,400
I know that.

239
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:22,710
And...you guys have been here a while, aren't you hungry?

240
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:24,950
Why didn't you order?

241
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,400
Yeah, I'm hungry.

242
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,520
Me too, I totally forgot about it.

243
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,790
Alright, so what should we have?

244
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,190
Mmm...

245
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:32,990
Okay, got it.

246
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:36,350
Oh, Yai, you eat here too?

247
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,020
Er, that's right.

248
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,340
Nine, are you here with friends?

249
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,100
No, I'm on my own.

250
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:48,100
Then, that's good. Would you like to join us?

251
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,470
Here, have a seat.

252
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,480
C'mon.

253
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:56,510
Of course.

254
00:20:03,060 --> 00:20:05,060
Now, the five seats are full.

255
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,960
Er, Nine, are you just finished with the meeting?

256
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:22,610
Oh, yes, so I thought I'd come here and grab a bite.

257
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,900
What a coincidence!

258
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,900
Yeah, very much so.

259
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,740
Here. Prawn dumpling, Yai's favorite.

260
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,100
Thank you.

261
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:45,830
You can't have this.

262
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,390
You're allergic to prawns, right?

263
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,070
I'll eat it for you.

264
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,500
I'm not.

265
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:03,180
When did you become allergic to prawns? I didn't know about it.

266
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,790
Mmm, that's alright.

267
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:09,790
Take this instead, the yummy crab dumpling.

268
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:19,830
Crab is also a no-no.

269
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:23,830
You can't have any of this, right? You're allergic to all of them.

270
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,660
I'll eat it for you.

271
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,990
Yes, he can eat it.

272
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,500
No, he can't.

273
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:33,770
Hey!

274
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,450
Stop it!

275
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,530
You two!

276
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,130
We all should eat by ourselves.

277
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,800
And I'm not allergic to prawns and crabs.

278
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:21,540
I thought you were. Didn't you have rash on having those?

279
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,540
We should eat before our food gets cold.

280
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,040
Oh, so good.

281
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,260
Very good.

282
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,430
What a coincidence!

283
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,620
There are so many restaurants in the neighborhood.

284
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,210
But you found us here.

285
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,500
I'm a regular here.

286
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,500
If I'm gonna eat here, it's perfectly normal.

287
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,100
Let's get real here.

288
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,940
Are you thinking about hitting on Yai?

289
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,140
Mmm.

290
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,750
If I'm going to do it, then what?

291
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,710
That's gonna be hard.

292
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,080
I happened to be here first.

293
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:41,530
When you said you were here first, was it about 10 years ago?

294
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,530
Sorry.

295
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,370
Yai's family and mine are business partners.

296
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:54,410
We will be seeing each other more often.

297
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:58,790
And one more thing, I'm back to work here in Thailand for good.

298
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:05,630
Anyway, try harder.

299
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,850
I remember you always order the same food.

300
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,680
That's because it's tasty.

301
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,560
True, I'm not arguing here.

302
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,160
Mmm.

303
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,470
Yai, let me give you a ride.

304
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:37,050
Hey, that's alright, Nine.

305
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
It's not in your direction.

306
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
It's totally fine.

307
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,010
In the past, I could always drop you off.

308
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:50,890
It's alright.

309
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,220
I'll give him a ride.

310
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,560
Mangkorn can drop me off.

311
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,500
We got here together.

312
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:11,180
Right, Hong, Nadear, are you gonna go somewhere afterwards?

313
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,290
Would you like Nine to drop you off?

314
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,450
It's alright. We're gonna go hang out.

315
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:20,850
Okay, then, see you all soon, I guess.

316
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,220
And you two, don't get naughty anywhere.

317
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,220
Alright, Mangkorn.

318
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:30,930
Mangkorn, you gotta take a good care of Yai too, understood?

319
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:37,770
Then...

320
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,400
let's go.

321
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,390
We should leave.

322
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,270
Bye-bye.

323
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,260
See ya!

324
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,010
I'm off.

325
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:50,390
Let's go.

326
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,060
All the way to the front.

327
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,970
Oh.

328
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,740
Can I choose the next ride?

329
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,740
Of course.

330
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:46,180
Which one do you wanna play?

331
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,260
Let's go!

332
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,120
Are you not having fun?

333
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:04,740
And, are you gonna be here in Bangkok for long, Hong?

334
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,740
Mmm, I think I need to find a job here.

335
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,910
Oh, this is good.

336
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:17,910
Yes, it's good.

337
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:22,400
I want to own a bakery place after eating this.

338
00:28:22,810 --> 00:28:26,250
Do it. And let me be your first customer.

339
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:28,810
I guarantee you the place will be packed!

340
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:32,690
Hmm, you made it sound so easy.

341
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,620
There's fund.

342
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:37,070
And there are so many expenses.

343
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:40,070
You study B.A. You must know it, right?

344
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:45,180
I do but I was just saying. Don't complain.

345
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:54,630
But seriously, being able to make it through each day, that's quite good already.

346
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:01,630
Mmm, even other people see us as weirdos...

347
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,550
Why is calling out for the right we deserve...

348
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:10,550
so hard?

349
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,970
Then, should we move to another country?

350
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:21,970
Huh?

351
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:29,500
Move to where we can have a marriage certificate.

352
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:34,830
New Zealand, England or the US...

353
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,030
Where would you like to go, Hong?

354
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:40,030
Wait, I'm not ready to move.

355
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:49,190
Then you find a way to tell your Pa by yourself.

356
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,090
Which way?

357
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,920
Help me think.

358
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,090
I've done that so many times that I run out of ideas.

359
00:29:59,570 --> 00:30:01,570
I've already told you everything.

360
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,070
"Pa, this is my girlfriend."

361
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,150
Are you for real?

362
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,300
Yes.

363
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:43,470
What?

364
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:52,800
So did you have fun today?

365
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,800
Yes, I did.

366
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:55,870
But I'm not used to it.

367
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,310
And I got a bit dizzy.

368
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,910
You're hilarious.

369
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,410
You're afraid of every ride.

370
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:05,030
That's not true. A Grandpa's car ride was fine.

371
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,070
Can I suck it?

372
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,670
What?

373
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,080
Here?

374
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,190
I meant, your bubble milk tea.

375
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,470
No.

376
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:23,480
You got your own, have that.

377
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,160
Please.

378
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,440
I'd like to suck yours.

379
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
Can I suck it?

380
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,070
No.

381
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:32,830
Please, please, please, can I suck yours?

382
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,110
No.

383
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,120
Please, please, please.

384
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,120
Alright, there you go.

385
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,040
Hey.

386
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,520
I wanna play that!

387
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,380
Why?

388
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:54,520
Don't you know that this machine robs everyone?

389
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,540
Wait and see.

390
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,690
I'm good at this.

391
00:31:58,690 --> 00:31:59,690
C'mon.

392
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,330
A little bit to the right.

393
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:09,970
I'll get the one in the front.

394
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,030
Press it.

395
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,040
Alright.

396
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,040
Go for it!

397
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,340
Hey, that was close.

398
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,940
There, there, get closer.

399
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,140
This one?

400
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:29,130
Do it!

401
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,450
Man!

402
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:32,890
Oh.

403
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:33,890
Are you really good?

404
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:37,050
Last time already, I'll get you two of them.

405
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:42,150
Alright? Just wait and see, I'm really good at this.

406
00:32:42,150 --> 00:32:43,190
Go for it.

407
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,320
Now?

408
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,160
I got this.

409
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,280
There!

410
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,870
Hey, hey.

411
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,090
Is this it?

412
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:50,130
Hurry up!

413
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,520
Here we go!

414
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:52,680
Hey!

415
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,680
Ah!

416
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:57,470
Wow!

417
00:32:59,030 --> 00:32:59,980
You're good.

418
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,500
How many hundreds more would you like?

419
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,500
Wait, you just got one.

420
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,300
I've told you...

421
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:11,990
I am good.

422
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:12,990
There.

423
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:17,700
Do you like it?

424
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,700
Yes.

425
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:27,580
But it's a pity. They should have a tiger too.

426
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:31,890
Hey, just one dragon is enough.

427
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:35,570
Well, they would make a good pair.

428
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:37,570
A dragon and a tiger...

429
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,480
Hey.

430
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:49,450
The lights went off.

431
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,660
Did we play till the system is broken?

432
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,330
I don't think so.

433
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,610
The machine still got lights on.

434
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:08,429
Hey, it's 12:30 a.m.

435
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,449
Let's go home.

436
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,250
Not yet.

437
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:15,570
What now?

438
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,330
I'm not done here.

439
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:32,770
Here.

440
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,170
This is for you.

441
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:37,489
Why are you giving me this?

442
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,090
Well...

443
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:43,530
I want to.

444
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,850
When did you buy it?

445
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:49,889
Since the Dragon Temple.

446
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,250
When exactly?

447
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,260
When you went to the restroom...

448
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,570
I thought it looked really nice.

449
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:05,120
And do you know how much this symbol means?

450
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,910
I must know it. My Mom gave me one.

451
00:35:09,910 --> 00:35:11,780
You're so unbelievable.

452
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:14,470
You knew that it was mine but you didn't return it.

453
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:19,470
I thought I'd give it back when we became friends.

454
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:26,270
Oh, friends?

455
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,640
Would you like to be more than that?

456
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,170
Here.

457
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,650
Wear it for me.

458
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,260
Alright.

459
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:49,970
Yin and Yang.

460
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,870
The symbol of balance of the nature.

461
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:57,020
Like...

462
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:06,540
A dragon, a tiger, a phoenix and a turtle...

463
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,700
from different directions.

464
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:18,290
But about you and me, I have no idea what textbook we're in.

465
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:20,290
Mmm.

466
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:28,370
I guess, we both are from...A dragon owns Yai.

467
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,160
A dragon owns Yai?

468
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,450
A tiger and a dragon,

469
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:43,450
who were enemies since the beginning.

470
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:47,800
Never thought that...

471
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,810
we would meet this way.

472
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,570
Which way?

473
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:57,130
You.

474
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:04,150
The one who makes my heart pounding...

475
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,150
everytime I'm around you.

476
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:17,670
For everything that has been through,

477
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,230
I'm sorry, Yai.

478
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:29,990
I'm sorry about my way getting to you.

479
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,550
And it hurt you.

480
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:37,350
But I promise you,

481
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,590
that from now on,

482
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,980
I'll never make you shed a tear.

483
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,260
Mangkorn.

484
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:01,310
I...

485
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:03,310
Please be my partner.

486
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,200
Hey.

487
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,210
You're not asleep yet?

488
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,850
Are you gonna look at me until morning?

489
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,090
Well, can I?

490
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:56,770
Just stop it.

491
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,080
Go to sleep.

492
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,770
Thank you...

493
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,770
for giving me a chance.

494
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,720
Beloved.

495
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,160
Go to sleep.

496
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:22,710
Beloved, beloved.

497
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,060
Sleep now.

498
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:33,570
I told you to go to sleep.

499
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,080
It's time to sleep.

500
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,370
Hey.

501
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,090
Have you been up for long?

502
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,820
I've been looking at you since...

503
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,830
the sunrise.

504
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,370
Can I ask you something?

505
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,310
Mmm.

506
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:06,320
When did you realize that you liked me?

507
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:17,220
Where are you off to?

508
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,030
Tell me.

509
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:25,430
I don't know.

510
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:30,880
When I knew it, I'd already fallen for you.

511
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,840
Oh.

512
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,230
You're not being straightforward here.

513
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:40,240
Well, I really have no idea.

514
00:42:41,570 --> 00:42:43,730
But you!

515
00:42:44,250 --> 00:42:47,250
When did you have a crush on me?

516
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:54,890
Do you want a real answer or a funny one?

517
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,900
A real one.

518
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,080
Mmm.

519
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,920
I've liked you since you're a freshman.

520
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,920
Really? wow.

521
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,550
When you entered the uni's star competition...

522
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:22,320
You were so damn cute.

523
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,960
So sweet, aren't you?

524
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,720
What if you really liked me since the first year,

525
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,720
why wouldn't you hit on me then?

526
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:40,280
You know the answer. I don't know how to hit on anyone.

527
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:54,680
What if we both hadn't met at the bar,...

528
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:58,360
do you think we would have gotten to this point?

529
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:01,160
I don't know.

530
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:06,900
No matter what, I'll have to find a way to get to you anyway.

531
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:17,080
Because you are the only one in my heart.

532
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,500
Then...

533
00:44:28,530 --> 00:44:29,530
from now on...

534
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:35,760
don't ever leave me.

535
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:56,910
I won't.

536
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:36,290
Can I ask you something?

537
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:40,250
Yeah.

538
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:45,240
What do you want to do...

539
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,260
after you graduate?

540
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:54,300
Well, an architect.

541
00:51:56,310 --> 00:51:57,310
But,

542
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:00,190
I want to have good credentials.

543
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:03,790
So many people would hire me.

544
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:08,270
And if I can make a living by myself,

545
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:11,830
my Pa and Ma would be so proud of me.

546
00:52:15,850 --> 00:52:16,860
That's nice.

547
00:52:20,330 --> 00:52:23,930
Your dream...

548
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:25,930
is also my happiness.

549
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:33,650
Mmm...

550
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:42,480
But...before you go to sleep,

551
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,120
There's one thing I need to consult with you.

552
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:51,080
Yai.

553
00:52:56,030 --> 00:52:57,040
Yai.

554
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:39,120
What the heck?

555
00:53:42,790 --> 00:53:46,180
Letting the stars and the wind...

556
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:50,180
send my regards to the person I love the most in my life.

557
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:54,750
Yai, please forgive me.

558
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,370
I thought you wrote a poem for me.

559
00:54:02,910 --> 00:54:03,910
Hey, stop it!

560
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:05,590
How did you get that?

561
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,090
Give it back!

562
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:07,890
No!

563
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:08,890
I like this!

564
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:10,850
I think it's pretty lame.

565
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:15,590
So I went out to buy some roses and threw their pedals all over your floor.

566
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:17,990
And after this, I'll call you...

567
00:54:17,990 --> 00:54:21,370
Mr. Mangkorn and his rose pedals.

568
00:54:21,370 --> 00:54:22,370
Hey, stop it!

569
00:54:23,730 --> 00:54:27,410
Where did you get another stuffed animal?

570
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:29,570
I went to clamp it.

571
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:31,570
How about that one I got you?

572
00:54:34,730 --> 00:54:37,730
Letting the stars and the wind...

573
00:54:37,730 --> 00:54:38,670
Stop it!

574
00:54:38,670 --> 00:54:39,760
What?

575
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:40,620
Don't!

576
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:41,760
That's enough!

577
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:42,340
Give it back!

578
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:43,130
Don't!

579
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:44,360
Give it back!

580
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:49,030
Are you being naughty? Huh?

581
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:53,560
send my regards...

582
00:54:59,490 --> 00:55:03,420
Are you being naughty?

583
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:31,720
I like this.

584
00:55:48,490 --> 00:55:52,520
You've been accepted to a TS-ACT 2022 project in the United States of America.

585
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:55,790
From now on,

586
00:55:55,990 --> 00:55:57,990
don't ever leave me.

587
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,890
Please move there with me.

588
00:56:14,890 --> 00:56:16,890
We can be there together.

589
00:56:19,330 --> 00:56:21,330
How can I go, Mangkorn?

590
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,960
I have to take care of the bar.

591
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:30,880
But if you consider this opportunity,

592
00:56:33,820 --> 00:56:37,790
I'll come back and have a good career and make a living out of it.

593
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:41,570
That's right.

594
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:45,540
Your dream...

595
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:50,750
is also my happiness.

596
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,720
And is there a reason...

597
00:56:58,710 --> 00:57:00,710
I shouldn't let you go?

598
00:57:11,530 --> 00:57:12,530
Please be my boyfriend.

599
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:43,510
The Sunrise Bar is now rebranded to The New Sunrise!
