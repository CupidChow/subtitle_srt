00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,610
Listen to me now.

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:12,220
No matter what you do,

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:15,560
you're never going to beat me.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,400
And about last night,

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,690
You won't be able to forget it.

7
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,390
Dad! I'm going to renovate the bar!

8
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,350
Anxiety is a kind of emotion,

9
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:40,350
that leads to stress.

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,610
It may be caused by the event in the future

11
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,620
that we cannot predict.

12
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,120
Hello. Poon.

13
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,480
Hello, so what's the deal?

14
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,960
Er...

15
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,410
I...I won't be able to make it.

16
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,820
Yeah, yeah, that's alright.

17
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,740
You should go back to work.

18
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:39,740
We'll go check in now.

19
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,470
G Design is ready, Mr. Yai.

20
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,479
Mmm, let them in.

21
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,000
From the briefing at the beginning of the hour,

22
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,090
we have decided to start the project as soon as possible

23
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,090
so that the bar can be reopened as usual.

24
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,650
Thank you so much, Mr. Rat.

25
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,250
My company and G Design have been partners for a long time.

26
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:30,250
This project, it must turn out perfect.

27
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:33,190
With pleasure, Mr. Barom.

28
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,040
Er...

29
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,210
would it be okay if...

30
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,650
we postpone the renovation?

31
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,220
You said you would oversee it yourself.

32
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,030
And what about rebranding that you talked about?

33
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:54,750
And the expansion of the bar...

34
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,030
No, Yai.

35
00:03:56,030 --> 00:04:01,490
I told you that you're gonna be the one in charge with the whole project.

36
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,360
And one more thing,

37
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,970
learn to be responsible.

38
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:08,740
The shelves at the bar that you destroyed were worth a car.

39
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,740
Normally, you spend the money...

40
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,519
Please excuse us.

41
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,160
We have another place to go examine.

42
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,210
So on Monday, we'll go to the bar

43
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:25,210
to examine and measure.

44
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,990
I must thank you once again, Mr. Rat.

45
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:33,320
I'll leave my son to you.

46
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:37,330
He'll be the one overseeing the whole project himself.

47
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,530
With pleasure, Mr. Barom.

48
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:44,140
Right, Fai.

49
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,470
In the afternoon, could you contact PM for me, please?

50
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:50,150
Mmm, and about the contract, when it's finished...

51
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,350
we'll start working on the schematic design.

52
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,670
Right away, Mr. Rat.

53
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,080
Er...and thank you, Mr. Yai, very much...

54
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,240
for reaching us.

55
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,090
If you have anything else,

56
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,050
please feel free to call the same number.

57
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,580
I will.

58
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:07,860
Er...Mangkorn.

59
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,860
Could you grab the laptop for me?

60
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,020
Excuse me.

61
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:14,270
Please.

62
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,270
Mr. Rat, this way, please.

63
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,210
Do you really have to demolish it, Mr. Alangkarn?

64
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,409
What the hell do you mean?

65
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,560
I mean...

66
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,560
the suite that we had sex last night.

67
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:58,240
That kind of shitty memory,

68
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,180
why would I keep it?

69
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,180
Good.

70
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:08,430
Because even if you demolish it,

71
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:10,480
do you really think that...

72
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,480
it's all going to end?

73
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,390
Mangkorn.

74
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:28,190
Those video clips,

75
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,190
are they only with you?

76
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:35,550
Mmm, they haven't leaked yet.

77
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,720
Delete every video clip,

78
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,720
or you'll get in trouble.

79
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,550
Why should I?

80
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,000
Those video clips are so hot.

81
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,000
And I wasn't the one who hit record button.

82
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,880
How was it?

83
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:01,440
Did you like my little dragon?

84
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:02,770
C'mon!

85
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:07,030
Punch me.

86
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,060
Don't you love it?

87
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:13,510
The violence.

88
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,590
Right.

89
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:44,990
Thought you'd have it in you.

90
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,040
We have sent off the architects already, Mr. Yai.

91
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,440
Mmm.

92
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,210
Mmm...are you alright?

93
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:19,570
You can tell us.

94
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,820
I'm bummed, guys.

95
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,890
I shouldn't have told my Dad about renovating the bar.

96
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,010
I should've waited for him to come back first.

97
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,090
Now, I gotta see Mangkorn for months.

98
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,080
Damn it, I shouldn't have.

99
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,610
Mmm...but...

100
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,710
you won't be seeing him everyday, right?

101
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:44,710
Just seeing his shadow makes me lose my focus on work.

102
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,600
Park. Pong.

103
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,150
May I ask for a favor?

104
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,200
What is it?

105
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,800
Could you...

106
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,720
spy on Mangkorn...

107
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,880
and...

108
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:05,430
steal his phone for me?

109
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,160
His phone?

110
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,160
Why stealing his phone?

111
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,440
Just do it.

112
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,010
Don't ask.

113
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,810
I guess that won't be possible.

114
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:19,650
Because Mr. Mangkorn said,

115
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,070
if we did it again, he would call the police.

116
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,800
Police?

117
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,740
You know my Dad is in charge in this area.

118
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,710
Well, Mr. Barom...

119
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,480
was the one who told us that if you got yourself in trouble,

120
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,380
he would take away your credit card and your car.

121
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,980
Yes, and you will be scolded until your ears go numb.

122
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,020
Oh, wow.

123
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,030
You both get along really well.

124
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,700
Guys, help me out here, please.

125
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,220
Please.

126
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,230
Please, please, please.

127
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:51,800
I guarantee you that I won't get you two in trouble this time.

128
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,600
Mmm.

129
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,400
No.

130
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,130
Grilled beef meal, my treat?

131
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,090
No.

132
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,150
VIP movie tickets?

133
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,360
No.

134
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,170
New PlayStation?

135
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:02,550
Oh, yes, of course.

136
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,040
No!

137
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:04,890
Oh, right, right.

138
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,740
No, sir, no.

139
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,070
Whoa! too many NOs.

140
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:11,800
You are so annoying.

141
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:22,700
Er..Mr. Yai, about...

142
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,850
Don't say it.

143
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:26,900
Don't want to think about it.

144
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,240
That means last night it really happened...

145
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,770
What did you say?

146
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,710
Say it loud so I can hear you too.

147
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,890
Oh, it's nothing.

148
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:37,010
Mr. Yai, are you alright?

149
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,510
Would you like us to go to the hospital with you?

150
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:41,460
Hospital? What for?

151
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,040
I'm alright.

152
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,650
It seems like you're having pain in the...

153
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,240
Don't.

154
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,580
What if I go, what should I say to the doctor?

155
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,250
Huh?

156
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:53,620
I showered and fell on the roll-on deodorant?

157
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,600
Think! Just think!

158
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,490
I will not go, no matter what.

159
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,790
Read this.

160
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,180
I will not go, no matter what.

161
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,640
So, how are you feeling?

162
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,640
Can you tell me?

163
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,450
Oh, and which one of you is the patient?

164
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,390
Oh.

165
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:24,590
Then, you two have to go wait outside.

166
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,110
So I can examine and give the patient some privacy.

167
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,310
Alright?

168
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:30,190
Alright.

169
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,190
Goodbye.

170
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,080
Here.

171
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:40,710
Sit down, please.

172
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,570
So how are you feeling?

173
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,580
Well...

174
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,350
I have a pain in the butt from the situation last night.

175
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,170
I was in the shower,

176
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,350
and I fell on the roll-on deodorant.

177
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,070
Huh?

178
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,070
I'm telling the truth!

179
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,070
Don't you believe me?

180
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,600
Hey, Park.

181
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:14,810
What do you think Mr. Yai is like now?

182
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:16,620
What he's like now? I think he...

183
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:20,180
is bending down to have the doctor examine.

184
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:22,490
That makes me feel sorry for him.

185
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,710
Excuse me, I can't find my Mom.

186
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,710
Could you please take me to my Mom?

187
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,110
Ask this guy here.

188
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,250
What?

189
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,960
Why?

190
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,530
I don't like kids.

191
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,420
Excuse me, I can't find my Mom.

192
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,470
Could you please take me to my Mom?

193
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,880
Er...which way were you coming from?

194
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,200
That way.

195
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,040
Oh.

196
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,570
And can you remember your name and last name?

197
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:58,900
I can.

198
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,680
That's very good.

199
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,680
Then I, and this uncle over here...

200
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,440
will take you to the information counter, okay?

201
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:06,720
Okay!

202
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,720
Let's go!

203
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:28,370
So the roll-on deodorant that we're speaking of,

204
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:31,880
is it a small one or a big one?

205
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,880
Huh?

206
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,190
A big one.

207
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,170
And do you still feel the pain?

208
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:48,480
Yes, I do.

209
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,480
Well, I have to check now.

210
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,660
Hey.

211
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,510
How did you get here?

212
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:55,760
Hello, Doctor.

213
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,520
Hello.

214
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,440
Who is this? Why are you in here?

215
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:00,730
He's someone I know.

216
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:01,730
His boyfriend.

217
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,380
This is my boyfriend.

218
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,120
Oh.

219
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Big...

220
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,750
That's your name. (Yai = Big)

221
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,360
So the roll-on deodorant is big too.

222
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,330
Well...

223
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:27,490
it's not severe. Just pick up the medical cream from the pharmacy, alright?

224
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,130
I'll see you outside.

225
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,970
Hey.

226
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,490
How could you say that in front of the doctor?

227
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:43,340
What if he thinks that we're...

228
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,900
a couple?

229
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,690
I thought...

230
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,640
we were since that day.

231
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,550
A couple, my ass!

232
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,630
Come here.

233
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,860
We need to clear things up.

234
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,420
How did you get here?

235
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,980
Did you spy on me?

236
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,130
You...

237
00:14:59,130 --> 00:15:01,800
Do you watch too many dramas?

238
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,450
A guy like you?

239
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:05,760
I should be following?

240
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,320
Then why are you here?

241
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,790
My company has to renovate this place.

242
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,380
And...

243
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:16,370
I happened to see Park and Pong here.

244
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,400
Oh, right.

245
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,320
Where are Park and Pong?

246
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,990
I don't know.

247
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,190
I didn't ask.

248
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,920
But I wanted to answer.

249
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,910
You got a problem with that?

250
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,670
You, nosy little tiger.

251
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,390
Ouch!

252
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:48,270
That hurts.

253
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:50,390
Hey, where are you going?

254
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,380
Whom did you say was nosy?

255
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,210
It's my business.

256
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:58,490
Right.

257
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,290
What?

258
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:01,490
Well, you...

259
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:03,480
should put on the cream that the doctor prescibed.

260
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:24,220
Go get the medical cream, please.

261
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:30,960
The hell with today!

262
00:16:37,810 --> 00:16:39,460
Thank you so much.

263
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,690
If it weren't for you two,

264
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,380
I didn't know what would happen with Fah.

265
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,090
Say thanks to them, sweetie.

266
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,890
Thank you.

267
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:53,660
You're very welcome, ma'am.

268
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,660
Don't you wander around alone like this again, alright?

269
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,680
If your Mom tells you to wait, you have to wait there.

270
00:16:58,680 --> 00:16:59,570
Okay?

271
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,500
Okay.

272
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,660
High Five!

273
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,510
Good!

274
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,480
Well, would you excuse us?

275
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,410
Please.

276
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,700
Thank you again.

277
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,040
You're welcome.

278
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,319
Bye-bye.

279
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,319
Let's go.

280
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,990
Where have you guys been?

281
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,250
I've been looking for you around the examine room for a long time.

282
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:26,460
We're sorry, Mr. Yai.

283
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,500
There's a lost kid.

284
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,710
So we had to bring her here.

285
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:30,950
Oh, that's right, Mr. Yai.

286
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:32,480
Helping a kid...

287
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,990
What the heck?

288
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,280
You just said you didn't like kids.

289
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:35,910
C'mon.

290
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:37,440
Enough! Stop arguing.

291
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:40,490
It's because you two wouldn't guard the room,

292
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:42,240
Mangkorn barged in.

293
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,150
Huh? Mangkorn?

294
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,270
Yes!

295
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:49,040
Are you deaf, Park?

296
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,910
The phone thing is one thing.

297
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,680
If you two had been there,

298
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:55,510
you could have stolen his phone by now.

299
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,150
Oh.

300
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,150
Where are you going, Mr. Yai?

301
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,770
Mmm, and are you gonna go to work tomorrow?

302
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,890
I think I'm gonna take a few days rest.

303
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,980
When is Dad coming back?

304
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,740
This Friday.

305
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,850
And you're also having a meal with him.

306
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:27,610
This Friday?

307
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,610
There are seven days in a week.

308
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,490
And he chose Friday?

309
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,490
Very bad traffic on Fridays.

310
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,970
Hey, why are you sitting down?

311
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:41,960
Let's go.

312
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,190
Do you think he's alright?

313
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,180
Hey, Mangkorn.

314
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,850
The memory card I had you take the photos at the hospital,...

315
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,160
have you sent that to me yet?

316
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,650
Oh, I had a messenger deliver it to you already.

317
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:39,520
I think it should be there in 10 minutes.

318
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,400
Then you finish the rest of the work Fai assigned?

319
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:44,960
Of course, Mr. Rat.

320
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,460
Okay, and you uploaded to the drive already?

321
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,290
Shit!

322
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
Oh, the battery is dead.

323
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:51,810
Take off your shoes now!

324
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:57,240
Why does it have to be now?

325
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,240
The stairs are that way.

326
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,260
Fai, why isn't our backup electricity working?

327
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:34,560
I don't know too.

328
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,690
That was close.

329
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,890
Now, you'll never be lost.

330
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,880
Such a cute sticker.

331
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,820
Yai.

332
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,500
Hey, Nadear.

333
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,050
Have you waited long?

334
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:56,010
Not at all.

335
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:59,010
Here are the sheets you asked for the other day.

336
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,640
Oh my gosh, these are a lot.

337
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,880
Thank you so much.

338
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,410
It's so nice to have a senior like you!

339
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:06,930
Hey, it's okay.

340
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:07,800
Have you eaten anything?

341
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,260
Not yet.

342
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,410
Well, I thought I was gonna treat you.

343
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,140
But I got a class.

344
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,690
Right.

345
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,290
Oh, but I got this.

346
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,720
What is it?

347
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:21,110
Snack. In exchange.

348
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:24,110
For the sheets you gave me.

349
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,340
There, try.

350
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,450
It's good.

351
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,770
Hmm, you know what, take them.

352
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:38,570
Take them all.

353
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,930
And these, I'll return them to you, okay?

354
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,090
Bye-bye, I'm off.

355
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,540
See ya.

356
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,540
See ya!

357
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,670
Let me have some.

358
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,530
Just one is enough.

359
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:17,760
Come to think of it...

360
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:23,310
Mmm, when Mr. Yai is in the bad mood
and when he's normal, it's like he's a total different guy.

361
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,720
Are you not used to it yet?

362
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,490
Well, I am...

363
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:31,490
But I have never seen him destroying stuff like that day before.

364
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:35,730
That's the bar Mr. Barom loves so much.

365
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,050
Or do you think Mr. Yai knows about...

366
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:37,680
Hey!

367
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,010
Don't you say it.

368
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:43,210
If Mr. Yai knows, we'll all be in trouble.

369
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:45,090
Ouch, Pong, you piece of...

370
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:46,090
shit!

371
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,540
Serves you right.

372
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,860
No more for you.

373
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,860
That's all you're gonna get.

374
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,700
And is he here yet?

375
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,700
You, take a look there.

376
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:05,470
Park. Pong.

377
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:19,640
Ying and Yai are at the restaurant, right?

378
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,960
Yes, sir.

379
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,670
Shall we go now, sir?

380
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:25,550
Wait. Hold on.

381
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:27,550
I have someone with me.

382
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,120
Who?

383
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,210
Excuse us, excuse us. Thank you.

384
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,940
Hey, Mangkorn, what are you doing here?

385
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,610
Hey, Mac, and what are you doing here?

386
00:26:55,610 --> 00:26:57,540
I thought you're interning.

387
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,260
Yeah, I came by to have my teacher sign the papers.

388
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,100
It's not freakin' approved yet.

389
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:06,060
Well, I'm here to teach the juniors at the club.

390
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:07,950
You wanna come along?

391
00:27:07,950 --> 00:27:09,880
Go ahead. I'm a little busy today.

392
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,190
I have more errands outside to run too.

393
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,220
I'll see you, buddy.

394
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:14,740
See you, bro.

395
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,280
Where did he go?

396
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,290
Hello? When are you coming?

397
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,410
Everyone is here already.

398
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:18,140
Dad's there?

399
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:22,140
Okay, I'm on my way.

400
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:35,070
Ah...let's eat a lot today.

401
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:37,850
It's been a while since we have this big meal outside.

402
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,290
And altogether.

403
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,990
Ying, how's work at the hospital?

404
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,700
Lots of cases?

405
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,230
As usual, Dad.

406
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:49,800
Mmm, espcially, during new year...

407
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,080
All packed. And I gotta do the E-learning too.

408
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,690
Well, you gotta find time to rest too, you know.

409
00:28:56,690 --> 00:28:57,810
Or else, it'll be bad for your health.

410
00:28:57,810 --> 00:29:01,810
I know that, Dad. You too.

411
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:07,570
Hey, here he comes.

412
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:13,410
Sit down so we can all eat.

413
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,680
Let me introduce you to...

414
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:29,680
I thought you said you had a work meeting in China.

415
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:35,210
And why did you bring a woman here?

416
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,160
Oh, this is Auntie Li.

417
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,750
She's my colleague in China.

418
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:49,440
She will be helping me with the international business for a while.

419
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,440
But normally, you don't bring any collegues to a meal like this.

420
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:57,590
This is a family day.

421
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,960
C'mon, Yai, let's eat.

422
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,470
These are all your favorites.

423
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:10,790
C'mon.

424
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,300
Ying, you know about this too?

425
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,220
You love duck, right? I'll get one for you.

426
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,260
Please excuse me.

427
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,150
Mr. Yai.

428
00:30:40,150 --> 00:30:42,150
No need to follow.

429
00:30:45,830 --> 00:30:47,830
Just give him time.

430
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,020
Alright, everyone.

431
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:03,340
Welcome to Architecture club.

432
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:09,330
Today, Mangkorn, a 5th-year student
will be sharing his knowledge with you.

433
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,910
Hello, everyone.

434
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:19,470
My name is Mangkorn.

435
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:23,340
One of the skills that you absolutely need to work on the project is...

436
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,350
sketching.

437
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:29,070
And today, we're going to try to sketch the model.

438
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,110
Nowadays, people don't really sketch the models anymore.

439
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:34,830
Because we can render it 3D on computer.

440
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:38,830
But still, we need to keep learning.

441
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:43,170
So, shall we start?

442
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,180
Well, I'll start with mine first.

443
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:47,820
This is the interchange to the sky train in the future.

444
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:49,950
This will be crucial to the huge public transportation.

445
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,340
And the area around the bridge,

446
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:54,340
there will be communities built.

447
00:31:54,340 --> 00:32:01,330
And the activities that...

448
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:21,180
Oh.

449
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,620
Is there anything?

450
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,620
Mangkorn.

451
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,070
Are you free tonight?

452
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,600
Oh, there she is.

453
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,670
We can take it from here.

454
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,110
You two call Yai up, alright?

455
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:02,320
I don't know if he's eaten anything yet.

456
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:04,690
Yes, sir.

457
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:08,660
Well, buy some food for him to eat at his condo, alright?

458
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,980
Yes, sir, Mr. Barom.

459
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,330
Mmm, thanks.

460
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:15,330
Thank you so much and I'm very sorry.

461
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,410
Ah, let's go.

462
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:25,690
Hey, Park.

463
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:26,780
Huh?

464
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,610
I think I should call Mr. Yai.

465
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,140
Right, right.

466
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:37,360
Park.

467
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:37,960
Huh?

468
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,030
Mr. Yai is not answering his phone.

469
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:42,560
Well, call until he answers.

470
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,560
Okay.

471
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,960
He's not answering.

472
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:50,970
Hey, why don't you use your phone?

473
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:51,410
He might answer.

474
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,400
Right, right.

475
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,600
What should we do?

476
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:07,660
Mr. Yai has never been like this.

477
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:13,760
But it's not strange.

478
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:16,199
Since we've lost Mrs. Pei,

479
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,100
all Mr. Yai has is his Dad and his sister.

480
00:34:20,699 --> 00:34:23,590
Well, and two of us.

481
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:26,150
No matter how much money you have,

482
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:28,239
the warmth in the family

483
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,219
is also important.

484
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,460
Wouldn't the two of us understand that clearly?

485
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:35,750
Well, you're right.

486
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:43,750
I think we should drive around until we find him.

487
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,420
Alright, I'll keep calling.

488
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:11,260
p_punnapat : chilling with B.A. guys
(except for Mr. Yai, who always takes the rainchecks.)

489
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,430
Yai.

490
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,820
Hey, Da.

491
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,910
What's wrong with you today?

492
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:23,860
You're sad?

493
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,500
That you had to call me out here?

494
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,920
I'm a little bummed today.

495
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,910
So I had to find something to do before going home.

496
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:38,180
Are you going anywhere afterwards?

497
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,890
Actually, I'm going to a pool party around Sathorn.

498
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,310
Would you like to come with me?

499
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,380
Mmm...

500
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:48,380
Hey, I heard that...

501
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:51,900
there's a guy from Architecture, he's going too.

502
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,980
He's from the same uni as yours.

503
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,970
I heard that he's damn good-looking.

504
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,010
Who is it?

505
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,800
Today,

506
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,800
I'm gonna get you.

507
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,240
Yai.

508
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:49,360
You just got here?

509
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:49,920
Yeah.

510
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,910
C'mon, let's go to our seats.

511
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,800
You want anything? I'll order it for you.

512
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,840
Just a cocktail, please.

513
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,840
Okay, wait here.

514
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,870
Mangkorn.

515
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:04,080
What are you doing?

516
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,480
Nothing.

517
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,120
Nothing?

518
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,120
You have my bag.

519
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:36,450
Mr. Yai is not answering his phone.

520
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,110
We'll definitely have to get the phone.

521
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:42,470
You and I are just acquaintances, that's all.

522
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:43,950
I really want to be your friend.

523
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,990
But I, do not want to be your friend.

524
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,270
You haven't texted me lately.

525
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:53,270
Do you think a guy can date a guy?
