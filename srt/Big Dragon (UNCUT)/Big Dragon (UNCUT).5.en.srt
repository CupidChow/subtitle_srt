2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:10,230
Hong and Mangkorn's engagement ceremony!

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:12,600
Back then...

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,370
we were happier than we are now, weren't we?

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,540
Our house is so quiet.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,390
People...live in the present.

7
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,630
Nine.

8
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:22,280
You didn't tell me you were coming back to Thailand.

9
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,810
If I'd told you, it wouldn't have been a surprise.

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,090
Can I not?

11
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:27,290
My internship doesn't allow me much time.

12
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:11,160
I've already got someone.

13
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,160
That's enough, Cherry. It’s over.

14
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,140
Yai.

15
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,090
Just leave.

16
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,810
How could you do that?

17
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,530
It's not what it looked like.

18
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,450
Oh, you think I'm stupid?

19
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,650
You think I'm blind?

20
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,400
How could you do that?

21
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,810
You already have someone.

22
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,729
Someone?

23
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,170
The girl at the café.

24
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,360
I know that she's not just your junior.

25
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,520
You missed Arjo's celebration.

26
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,900
For this?

27
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,900
To do this shitty thing with who-knows-who?

28
00:01:56,259 --> 00:02:00,260
I told you it's not what it looked like.

29
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,660
If it's not what I thought it was, then what was it?

30
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,660
Huh?

31
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:12,010
You already got someone.

32
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:14,170
You shouldn't be doing stuff like this.

33
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:16,610
Don't you feel sorry for those girls?

34
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,610
You, piece of shit!

35
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,760
How dare you punch me?

36
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,640
You're a womanizer too, not different than me.

37
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,280
Let me say this straight to you.

38
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,210
The reason you're acting like you're mad at me,...

39
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:37,020
is it because you're mad for those girls...

40
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:41,020
or are you mad because you like me?

41
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:46,030
Answer me!

42
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,660
Answer!

43
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:08,010
If I didn't have to wait for you to delete the video clips,

44
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,820
I would be long gone from you.

45
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,810
I hate you.

46
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:21,930
Are you sure...

47
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,760
that if there weren't those clips,

48
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,040
you would be gone from me?

49
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,560
Yeah.

50
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,800
If you want to leak those videos, it's your damn business now.

51
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,800
I don't give a damn about it anymore.

52
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,040
If you want me to delete the videos,

53
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,540
you have to come home with me.

54
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,480
What exactly do I want…from Mangkorn?

55
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,980
"Wear this. :)"

56
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
"Wear this. :)"

57
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:46,700
Oh.

58
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,700
You're up.

59
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,030
Just wait a bit.

60
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:57,030
You can sit there.

61
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:05,240
And...

62
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,760
your clothes, I've already washed them.

63
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,510
But they aren't dry yet.

64
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,640
Here we go.

65
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:25,730
Stir-fried noodles with crab by Mr. Mangkorn.

66
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,130
Oh.

67
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:31,540
But...

68
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,330
it's my Ma's recipe.

69
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:34,730
Seaweed is included.

70
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,730
Yummy.

71
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,170
What?

72
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,580
Looking like that...

73
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,409
you don't wanna have it?

74
00:07:48,409 --> 00:07:50,360
Hey.

75
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:54,050
I'll eat it.

76
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,580
You look bummed.

77
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,690
So I thought you didn't wanna have some.

78
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,690
I made it with heart.

79
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,620
Alright.

80
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,180
I'll eat it.

81
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,180
Then, I'll feed you.

82
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,050
Here, lots of seaweed just for you.

83
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,220
And crab, too.

84
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,140
If my Ma were to see this, she would be so thrilled.

85
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,910
If someone says it's delicious...

86
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,520
Here.

87
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:36,610
Then...

88
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:38,610
another bite.

89
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,530
C'mon.

90
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,580
Hmm...

91
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,580
Yummy?

92
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,370
Alright, it's done.

93
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:45,630
I can't believe it...

94
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,220
that you also cook.

95
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,900
Don't I look like someone who can cook?

96
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:51,100
Well,

97
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,820
normally, you draw drafts.

98
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:56,950
So I didn't know that you could also cook.

99
00:09:56,950 --> 00:10:00,230
And you're a good one, also.

100
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,520
But you cheated.

101
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:06,030
You put a bunch of seaweed.

102
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,260
Anything would be tasty.

103
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:12,260
Whatever you say.

104
00:10:14,890 --> 00:10:18,090
And do you live here alone?

105
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:19,170
Yeah.

106
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,980
My Pa and Ma live out of town.

107
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:25,980
They come to Bangkok every once in a while.

108
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,050
So you must be lonely.

109
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,170
No.

110
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:34,170
Or...you're afraid that I might get lonely?

111
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,130
Then...

112
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:39,130
why don't you come live with me so I won't get lonely?

113
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,020
No.

114
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,790
Let me fix you up.

115
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,000
Come here.

116
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,560
It's alright, I'll do it myself.

117
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,250
It's okay.

118
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,810
Don't be stubborn.

119
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:18,810
Come here.

120
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,310
You're all bruised up.

121
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,750
Must be painful.

122
00:11:58,210 --> 00:11:58,920
Okay.

123
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,920
All done.

124
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,410
You got a bruise too.

125
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,890
No.

126
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:09,720
I got it.

127
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,130
Don't be stubborn.

128
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,930
This is soaked with medical cream.

129
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,260
No, it will hurt.

130
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:23,140
Get closer.

131
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,140
C'mon.

132
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,490
Don't look away.

133
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:33,120
Ouch. Ouch.

134
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
That hurts.

135
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,120
Such a pretender.

136
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,600
It really hurts.

137
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,290
I'll do it harshly.

138
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:43,290
You talk too much.

139
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,290
Right.

140
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,490
Wait here.

141
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,190
Okay.

142
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,720
I've already erased it a long time ago.

143
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,440
And the Drive I was talking about...

144
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,440
was just a hoax.

145
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,600
Here.

146
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,730
I don't want it.

147
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:22,730
Throw it away.

148
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Why?

149
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,750
Well, I don't wanna keep it.

150
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:35,220
You're a pain in the ass, really.

151
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:40,190
Hey.

152
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,190
Why is there a dragon sticker?

153
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,210
Don't ask.

154
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,050
You didn't want it.

155
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,570
It's cute.

156
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:51,570
I made it myself.

157
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,600
So...

158
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,870
I'll have a shower now.

159
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,380
Will there be anyone joining me?

160
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,380
Off you go.

161
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,540
I'll go to the uni.

162
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,540
But you don't have to come along.

163
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,580
I've ordered you some food.

164
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,750
Don't forget to fetch it.

165
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,590
Really?

166
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:34,590
I thought you're gonna go see that girl from last night.

167
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,270
Are you jealous?

168
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,630
Who's jealous?

169
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,760
Why jealous?

170
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,130
She used to be whom I was seeing.

171
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,680
We met at the bar.

172
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,490
But...

173
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,410
it's nothing serious.

174
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:03,410
You're jealous, aren't you?

175
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:07,420
Give me your phone.

176
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,180
Hey, what for?

177
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,180
Come on.

178
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,100
What are you doing?

179
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:23,080
There.

180
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,390
I've already added my number.

181
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:29,390
And pressed follow my Instagram account.

182
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,680
Are you mad?

183
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,890
Are you mad at me?

184
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,670
No, I'm not.

185
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,240
Awww, I'm making it up for you.

186
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,320
I'm not mad at you.

187
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,950
It looks like you are.

188
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,950
I'm telling you that I'm not.

189
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:50,950
I guess I'm gonna have to make it up with tasty snack.

190
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,710
Wow.

191
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,340
Looks so good.

192
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,190
C'mon, eat it.

193
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,430
No.

194
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:07,150
C'mon.

195
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,510
No.

196
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,790
Oh.

197
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:16,480
Hmm...

198
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,480
This is so good.

199
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,600
Smells great too.

200
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,200
C'mon, eat it.

201
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,270
No.

202
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,180
Would you eat it?

203
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,020
Oh, Ma.

204
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,230
What brings you here?

205
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:14,310
Isdaturma?

206
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,280
Huh?

207
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,599
Is that your Ma?

208
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,599
Yeah, she's my Ma.

209
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,280
Ma, how did you get here?

210
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,290
Why didn't you tell me that you're coming?

211
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:30,470
I just...

212
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,550
wanted to surprise you.

213
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,110
I came to Bangkok with...

214
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,580
Then...

215
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,090
Ma, you go wait downstairs, go.

216
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,020
Why?

217
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,740
Hurry up!

218
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,210
Hey.

219
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:41,050
I'll be right after you, go!

220
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:41,730
But I haven't met...

221
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,730
Ma, c'mon!

222
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,010
We'll talk in the afternoon,

223
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:53,110
okay?

224
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:04,980
Oh.

225
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,570
Why am I seeing his face?

226
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,060
What?

227
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,070
Look.

228
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,230
Well,

229
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,070
you're video-calling him.

230
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,110
Why are you guys calling?

231
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:15,510
What's up?

232
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:18,950
Oh, we went to bed already last night,

233
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:22,360
and we just saw your messages this morning.

234
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,040
Oh...

235
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,710
but...

236
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:28,160
Where are you at, Mr. Yai?

237
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,440
And what happened to your face?

238
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,160
Or...

239
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,400
Stop!

240
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
You guys! You just love teasing me.

241
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,870
Right, guys...

242
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,240
Could you do me a favor?

243
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,670
Please, please, please.

244
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:52,670
What is it?

245
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,070
Mr. Yai!

246
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,750
Let's go.

247
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,720
I told you to buy a mop.

248
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,600
How could you forget?

249
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,800
Oh.

250
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,060
Mr. Yai...

251
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,700
Are you supposed to dust it off first?

252
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,260
Not wet-wiping it first?

253
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:38,070
Man, don't question Mr. Yai...

254
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,070
You're no different.

255
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,630
How would the floor be clean with that?

256
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:47,580
Why didn't you use the broom?

257
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,580
You're so useless.

258
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:52,260
I've been looking for that.

259
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,850
Give me that.

260
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:56,850
So useless.

261
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,470
Hey!

262
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:06,760
Do you think Mr. Yai took the wrong medication?

263
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,480
Normally, he doesn't do all the cleaning at all.

264
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,520
He always hires the maids.

265
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,280
That's true.

266
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,040
Or Mr. Yai...

267
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:16,800
Pong! Park!

268
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,980
Nothing at all, Mr. Yai.

269
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,850
Huh?

270
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:23,850
What's with you?

271
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:28,110
I was just gonna tell you that it's almost 1 p.m.

272
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,070
Oh, oh, yes, sir.

273
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,590
We'll head out soon.

274
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,390
Right.

275
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:39,230
Then, I'll take care of the rest.

276
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:40,710
And...

277
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,240
thanks for bringing me the shirt.

278
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,890
You're welcome.

279
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:48,800
That was close.

280
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,120
W-w-w-w-what? Nothing at all.

281
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,280
Nothing at all, I didn't say a thing.

282
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,210
What?

283
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:54,290
Oh, it's nothing, sir, nothing at all.

284
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,330
Were you gossiping about me?

285
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,760
Oh, no, not at all.

286
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,480
You must have misheard it.

287
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,080
You've worked too much.

288
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,290
Just leave already.

289
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,290
We'll get going now.

290
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,050
Let's go.

291
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:10,010
What's with them?

292
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,010
They're so silly.

293
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,870
Is Mangkorn here?

294
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,740
Mangkorn?

295
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,300
He's not here now.

296
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,170
Then I'll just go grab something.

297
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:12,170
Er...

298
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,760
you're Hong, right?

299
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:34,750
Yes.

300
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,630
Are you close to Mangkorn?

301
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:40,830
Mmm...

302
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,830
I saw you at the café with Mangkorn the other day.

303
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:49,660
Well, I'm kinda close to him.
We've known each other since we were little.

304
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:05,420
I guess he hasn't told you yet, Yai.

305
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,480
I won't bother you any longer.

306
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,720
Thank you very much.

307
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:06,310
Why are you looking like that?

308
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:07,910
Look at the sunlight outside.

309
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,710
It's freakin' hot and the traffic was bad.

310
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,230
I am so exhausted.

311
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:14,040
You haven't stopped complaining since you arrive.

312
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:18,040
Here. Drink some water so you'll be calmer.

313
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,740
Okay, I'm a little bit calmer now.

314
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,220
Where were you?

315
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,730
I took the exams.

316
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:28,010
There were three subjects today, so confused?

317
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:31,900
Chinese, English, Selective...oh my gosh, that's a lot.

318
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:37,300
I almost passed out there because my head was about to explode.

319
00:25:38,290 --> 00:25:42,290
But luckily, I got a really good senior in line.
He gave me big pile of sheets.

320
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,820
He's handsome, good at studying, kind, and also rich.

321
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,700
He's like completely perfect.

322
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,430
Wow, that's a lot.
You're not secretly having a crush on him, are you, May?

323
00:25:52,430 --> 00:25:56,300
Oops, it's Nadear now, right?

324
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,830
Yeah but you can still call me May.

325
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:01,570
This is special, just for you to call me that.

326
00:26:01,570 --> 00:26:03,260
Hmm...

327
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,980
Alright, alright.

328
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,020
In case it makes you feel better.

329
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,740
Is this for me?

330
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,560
Yeah.

331
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,010
I was about to give it to you a long time ago.

332
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,010
Can I open it now?

333
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,680
Oh, wow.

334
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,650
Hey, was it the one we saw that day?

335
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:23,170
Hmm, wear it for me, would you?

336
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,330
Of course.

337
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:26,180
Which side?

338
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,330
This side.

339
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,330
Right away.

340
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,330
This is so cute.

341
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:34,730
So pretty.

342
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,970
Thank you so much.

343
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,010
Does that make you feel better?

344
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,250
Yes, a lot better.

345
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:40,890
So I should feel tired all the time, shoudn't I?

346
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,340
Hold it right there.

347
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:46,340
So, what's up with you, Hong?

348
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,250
Well, it's okay.

349
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:04,090
Just a look on your face, I know that you're not okay.

350
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,880
Are you troubled about your family?

351
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,450
But it's alright, don't be so stressed.

352
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,210
Let's order something to eat.

353
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:12,670
Mmm, already did.

354
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,940
Here they are.

355
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:15,940
Thank you.

356
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,510
Thank you.

357
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,550
Taste it if it's still as good.

358
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,450
Thank you.

359
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,320
Hold on, don't start. I'll have to take a pic first.

360
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,520
Again? You always take some pics.

361
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:36,550
Well, we haven't seen each other a lot.

362
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,470
No, I don't want to have my pics taken.

363
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,320
One. Two. Three.

364
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,200
Make a cute face!

365
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,840
You want me to make a cute face?

366
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:49,210
Then come sit here and take the pic with me.

367
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,210
Okay.

368
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,550
She's not my girlfriend.

369
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,520
She's my junior.

370
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:05,520
She just only took a ride with me to Bangkok.

371
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:26,110
"Architecture Building"

372
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,870
First of all,

373
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:53,870
I'd like to tell everyone...

374
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:56,950
I'm so proud of you all.

375
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,990
And I'm very glad that...

376
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:02,990
everyone joined our Architecture club.

377
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,660
The highlight of today is...

378
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:12,660
2022's best model award...

379
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:22,150
Let me congratulate each of you who submitted their works...

380
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:28,270
in order to get a 10,000 Baht prize.

381
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:34,350
But only one person will win this prize,

382
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,200
which is...

383
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:45,120
is...

384
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,270
myself!

385
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,270
Boo!

386
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,040
Just kidding, just kidding, you all.

387
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,300
Alright.

388
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,420
The one who will win 10,000 Baht...

389
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:59,420
that person is...

390
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:00,790
is...

391
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:04,590
is...

392
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,900
Excuse me.

393
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,480
Yai.

394
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,360
What's up?

395
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,400
You came all the way here to see me.

396
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,400
You miss me?

397
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,380
Hey.

398
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:10,140
I was just joking.

399
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,700
Right.

400
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,020
Are you hungry?

401
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,750
Let's go eat.

402
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,160
What do you wanna eat, it's your call.

403
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,640
So which one?

404
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:30,200
A girl named Hong...

405
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,200
is she your girlfriend?

406
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,400
Hey.

407
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,200
No.

408
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,170
She's not.

409
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,450
If she's not, just say that she's not.

410
00:31:44,450 --> 00:31:47,020
You were stuttering.

411
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,020
What does that mean?

412
00:31:56,670 --> 00:31:57,670
Hey.

413
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,840
I'll deal with my problem...

414
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,640
and then...

415
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,110
I'll tell you about it.

416
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:07,150
I'll tell you everything.

417
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,830
I promise.

418
00:32:08,830 --> 00:32:10,830
Can't you just tell me now?

419
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,030
No.

420
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,950
I'm not ready.

421
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,320
Why aren't you ready?

422
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,680
Do you want me to know all things before you start talking?

423
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,430
You can just tell me anything.

424
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:37,990
Is she your favorite?

425
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,340
She could get into your room.

426
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,620
Hey.

427
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:51,340
I'll...

428
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:54,630
deal with my problem as soon as I can.

429
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:57,070
You know,

430
00:32:57,070 --> 00:33:01,070
one thing that I don't like about you the most is...

431
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,020
I don't know any shit about you.

432
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,900
Finding out later...is pretty shitty.

433
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,620
Do you wanna know why?

434
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,780
Because that doesn't allow me to even give you any advice.

435
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,360
That means...

436
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,990
if I tell you now,

437
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,990
you'll be able to get it, right?

438
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,280
Well, it's better than knowing nothing.

439
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,720
A girl named Hong,...

440
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,230
she's my fiancée.

441
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:55,520
When I finished uni, I gotta marry her.

442
00:33:56,830 --> 00:34:00,830
Even though we're not lovers.

443
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,400
How do you think...I should solve this problem?

444
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,840
Why didn't you tell me?

445
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:20,929
If I told you,

446
00:34:20,929 --> 00:34:23,929
you would leave me.

447
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:31,810
I never wanted to lose you, Yai.

448
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,409
When would I learn about this?

449
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:36,409
Tomorrow when you get married?

450
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:40,620
Or the day that you disappear?

451
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:42,739
Will that be the way I'll find out?

452
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:48,330
When would I know it?

453
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:50,730
So that means...

454
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:54,730
what I've just told you, you didn't get any message at all?

455
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:04,670
Why do I have to face this shit?

456
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,600
Is it hard for you to tell the truth?

457
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,530
You know what,

458
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:17,530
before this, my life was good all along.

459
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,040
And then you came along.

460
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:28,130
Then...

461
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:31,330
if being with me troubles you that much,

462
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,530
leave me.

463
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:40,770
If having me means...

464
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:44,130
making you uphappy,

465
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,130
you can leave me.

466
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:48,930
Yeah, right.

467
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,920
What seems to be the problem, you just cut it off.

468
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,220
It's me.

469
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,840
I'm the problem.

470
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,760
I don't want you to be with the problem like me.

471
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,760
Relationships aren't easily cut off.

472
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,710
Just tell me if you have something on your mind.

473
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:13,710
So I'd know how I can help you.

474
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,940
And when I tell you the truth,

475
00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,940
do you even listen?

476
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:26,940
You keep on asking.

477
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:31,340
Frankly speaking,

478
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:35,340
you just care about your own feelings.

479
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,850
You're selfish, you know that?

480
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:44,210
You're scared that you're gonna feel like shit.

481
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:48,010
You're scared that you're gonne be stressed out.

482
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,800
But you don't care about my feelings.

483
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
You don't care about how I have to carry this shitty problem.

484
00:36:59,290 --> 00:37:01,410
And you forced me to tell you.

485
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:03,410
And when I tell you,

486
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:07,330
you can't take it.

487
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,250
Tell me,

488
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,330
can you handle this shit?

489
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:29,570
Is it a yes or a no?

490
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,450
Answer me!

491
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:50,610
I don't know.

492
00:37:58,210 --> 00:37:59,210
That's funny.

493
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:05,010
Even you,

494
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,780
can't be clear about your answer.

495
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:22,220
You want clarity from me...

496
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:27,410
but you can't even do it yourself.

497
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Who?

498
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:38,670
Who's the selfish one now?

499
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:06,790
That's enough.

500
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:09,340
You're drunk, Mr. Yai.

501
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,490
Mr. Yai.

502
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,650
Oh, it's all over the table.

503
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,340
Park, wipe it off.

504
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,330
That's enough.

505
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,780
You can't get more drunk, sir.

506
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,140
I'm not drunk.

507
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,410
Get me more.

508
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:21,060
Get me a lot more.

509
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,850
No. Don't get us more.

510
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,850
Oh, that's enough, sir.

511
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:27,570
Yai.

512
00:39:31,690 --> 00:39:33,170
Oh, Nine.

513
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,050
When did you come back to Thailand?

514
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:37,160
A while now.

515
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,690
Oh, that's enough, sir.

516
00:39:38,690 --> 00:39:41,280
We don't know what happened with Mr. Yai.

517
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,280
Look at him.

518
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,280
Park, clear this table.

519
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,810
No more, alright?

520
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:51,510
That's enough.

521
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,510
Okay?

522
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:01,250
Hey.

523
00:40:01,250 --> 00:40:03,170
Mr. Yai!

524
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,670
You, go stop him.

525
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:22,370
Today, I'm gonna sing a song for one person,

526
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:27,380
the person who changed my life.

527
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:33,810
Before,

528
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:37,810
I was a moody one.

529
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:40,300
Hot-tempered.

530
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,430
Self-centered.

531
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:47,430
I stood for only what I believed in.

532
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:52,190
Now, I'm calmer.

533
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:57,710
I listen to other people more.

534
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:02,180
This person...

535
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:07,000
makes me want to be a better person.

536
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,120
Unfortunately,

537
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:21,120
those feelings...

538
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:26,840
must be erased...

539
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:32,840
Because someone else walked in,

540
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:37,080
and took that one person away from me.

541
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:42,890
And what should I do next?

542
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,780
I can only...

543
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:49,780
stand here and smile at that person...

544
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:56,580
and let that person walk away.

545
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,120
"When love comes to the point,

546
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:21,880
where you and I have to end it."

547
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,890
"End it right here."

548
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:28,520
"There's no hope for me to hold you back."

549
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:35,080
"When I know that your heart doesn't belong here."

550
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:36,920
"No more."

551
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:43,720
"And all I can do is smile to our goodbye."

552
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:51,720
"And wish you and your half for the best."

553
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:00,730
"Letting you walk away along the path 'till I can't see you."

554
00:43:00,730 --> 00:43:04,490
"No excuses."

555
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:08,640
"I want to hold you but all I can do is...

556
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:12,730
letting you walk and disappear."

557
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:17,450
"In my heart, I want to beg you."

558
00:43:17,450 --> 00:43:20,500
"I want to bring you close so I can hold you."

559
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,640
"But now I know that it's too late,"

560
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:29,640
"All I can do is smile to the love that left me."

561
00:43:33,690 --> 00:43:35,080
Oh.

562
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,080
Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai!

563
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:49,710
Are you alright, Yai?

564
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:56,790
Mr. Yai! Mr. Yai!

565
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,400
Are you alright?

566
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,210
Hey.

567
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,530
Yai.

568
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:47,520
Where did you get all drunk last night?

569
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,320
Why did Nine drop you off here last night?

570
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,680
At Nine's bar.

571
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,880
Why did you let him sleep in my room?

572
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:56,710
We got so many rooms in our house.

573
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:59,870
What if you destroy the room again? What should I do?

574
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:03,790
And Nine volunteered to take care of you.

575
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:06,580
Are you about to go to uni?

576
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,080
Why don't you have a meal with us first?

577
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:09,080
Mmm...

578
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:12,780
No.

579
00:46:13,930 --> 00:46:14,930
Yai.

580
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:19,350
She invited you. Why won't you take it?

581
00:46:19,350 --> 00:46:22,990
Today is the first day of the semester.
I need to go see my friends.

582
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:23,990
I'm off.

583
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:37,800
Oh, wow.

584
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,440
Gosh.

585
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,830
Haven't seen you in so long, Mr. Yai.

586
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,700
How's your break?

587
00:46:42,700 --> 00:46:44,740
Did you score lots of girls?

588
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:45,940
What girls?

589
00:46:45,940 --> 00:46:47,010
None.

590
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:48,170
Damn.

591
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:49,560
Can we believe you?

592
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:51,010
We still don't know...

593
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:52,780
why you ditched me, George and Dew...

594
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,340
and let just three of us go.

595
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:57,130
And during the break, you disappeared.

596
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:57,880
You didn't reach us at all.

597
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:58,480
Mmm.

598
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:01,050
Right, sorry about that.

599
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:06,410
Hey, man.

600
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:08,330
Are you alright?

601
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:10,640
It's the first day of the fourth year,

602
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:12,110
yet you don't look happy at all?

603
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:16,110
That's true.

604
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:19,750
Oh, I'm fine.

605
00:47:19,750 --> 00:47:21,350
I'm just tired.

606
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:23,190
I had too many drinks last night.

607
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:26,360
If that's the case, then we need to do it again.

608
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:27,480
Nonsense, dude.

609
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:29,320
Do what again?

610
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:31,530
Let's start with you, shall we?

611
00:47:31,530 --> 00:47:32,530
Man, man.

612
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:43,140
Mangkorn: What are you doing?

613
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:04,870
Yai.

614
00:48:04,870 --> 00:48:07,070
Oh, Nine.

615
00:48:07,070 --> 00:48:09,480
What brings you here?

616
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,480
C'mon, get in the car. Let's go eat.

617
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:31,610
Wow.

618
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:32,880
How is it?

619
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,710
It looks delicious!

620
00:48:34,710 --> 00:48:36,550
But hold on,

621
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,550
I gotta take some pics first.

622
00:48:39,110 --> 00:48:40,110
Okay.

623
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,120
Why did you strike a pose?

624
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,400
I took a pic of the food.

625
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,790
Really?

626
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:54,190
I really did a cool pose earlier.

627
00:48:54,190 --> 00:48:56,190
Alright, I'll take one pic of you too.

628
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,840
One. Two. Three.

629
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:01,840
That's it, just one.

630
00:49:04,520 --> 00:49:05,520
Okay.

631
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:07,560
Alright, go ahead.

632
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,610
Can I use my hands?

633
00:49:10,610 --> 00:49:12,020
Of course.

634
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,770
Thank you.

635
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:14,770
Here we go!

636
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,540
How is it?

637
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:24,660
Delicious?

638
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:26,660
It's super delicious.

639
00:49:28,770 --> 00:49:29,310
Yai.

640
00:49:29,410 --> 00:49:30,610
Huh?

641
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,600
Yai.

642
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,130
It's on your cheek now.

643
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:36,180
You're like a kid.

644
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:37,180
Take it slowly.

645
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:43,930
Oh, Yai.

646
00:49:43,930 --> 00:49:45,250
Stay still.

647
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:46,210
What is it, Nine?

648
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:47,300
Just stay still.

649
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,960
What?

650
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:50,570
There's a worm.

651
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,050
Huh?

652
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:52,810
Calm down. Calm.

653
00:49:52,810 --> 00:49:53,640
What did you say?

654
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,930
Worm, there's a worm on your shirt.

655
00:49:54,930 --> 00:49:55,170
Be still.

656
00:49:55,170 --> 00:49:55,970
Where is it?

657
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:57,130
Just be still.

658
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:58,460
Alright, be still, hang in there.

659
00:49:58,460 --> 00:49:59,870
I'm still as a rock now.

660
00:49:59,870 --> 00:50:01,350
Get it off me, fast!

661
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:02,060
Did you get it?

662
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:03,590
Hey, there, little one.

663
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:03,790
Did you get it off me?

664
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:04,860
Here.

665
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:05,980
Look at that, it's huge!

666
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,430
Why are you showing it to me?

667
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:09,270
I'm scared.

668
00:50:09,270 --> 00:50:11,270
Okay, okay, I'm gonna put him away.

669
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:25,600
What's wrong?

670
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,450
You're still scared of worms?

671
00:50:27,450 --> 00:50:29,650
I still remember when you were in elementary school,

672
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:31,770
you cried so loud.

673
00:50:31,770 --> 00:50:33,660
Because there was a worm on your shirt just like this.

674
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:36,340
Damn, just speaking of it gives me goosebumps.

675
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:41,410
It's stuck on my mind forever.

676
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:47,010
Why are you laughing?

677
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:51,010
What if it's not a worm but a butterfly?

678
00:50:51,610 --> 00:50:54,120
Would you still be scared?

679
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:54,970
A butterfly?

680
00:50:54,970 --> 00:50:56,200
Yeah.

681
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,200
Why would I be scared of butterflies?
They're beautiful.

682
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:04,410
Why are you laughing, Nine?

683
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:09,670
Oh, nothing.

684
00:51:09,670 --> 00:51:11,580
I think...

685
00:51:11,580 --> 00:51:13,580
it's kinda cute.

686
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:28,980
Huh?

687
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:30,580
C'mon, let's eat.

688
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,140
It's not warm anymore, I think.

689
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:34,140
Alright, okay, okay.

690
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,020
Hey, Yai, you need to try this one.

691
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,980
The wings here are amazing.

692
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:46,480
And you gotta eat it with the renowned Kimchi.

693
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:48,610
You said they're amazing but you haven't eaten one.

694
00:51:48,810 --> 00:51:49,810
Well,

695
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:51,840
I want you to eat first.

696
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,130
This is really good.

697
00:51:52,130 --> 00:51:52,630
Okay.

698
00:51:53,130 --> 00:51:54,120
Thank you.

699
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:56,070
Let's clink our glasses first.

700
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:57,150
You need to say "Kampai".

701
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:58,430
Oh, yeah? Okay.

702
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:00,430
Kampai! Yeah!

703
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:01,210
This place got a really nice atmosphere.

704
00:53:01,210 --> 00:53:02,970
I saw a guy from Architecture named Mangkorn...

705
00:53:02,970 --> 00:53:05,010
getting all sneaky in front of our building.

706
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:07,020
I have nothing to say to you.

707
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:09,020
What should I do, Mom?

708
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,330
I've been facing with lots of problems.

709
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:14,490
If you love someone,

710
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:18,040
you must put yourself in their shoes.

711
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:19,400
You can't focus?

712
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,090
What if I were to be away for a few years,

713
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:23,550
would everything get better, Ma?

714
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:24,790
But you know, right?

715
00:53:24,790 --> 00:53:27,940
Doing that is running away from the problem...

716
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:28,940
Yai.

717
00:53:29,250 --> 00:53:30,450
Yai? Is it?
