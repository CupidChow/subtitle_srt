4
00:00:13,299 --> 00:00:14,709
Why act tough when you can’t handle it?

5
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:16,622
I’m sorry I hurt you.

6
00:00:16,948 --> 00:00:19,033
I’ll work on myself…

7
00:00:19,315 --> 00:00:21,209
until I’m someone worthy of you.

8
00:00:21,209 --> 00:00:22,381
This is really what you want?

9
00:00:22,381 --> 00:00:24,194
Walk away all you want.

10
00:00:24,324 --> 00:00:26,044
My love will still follow you everywhere.

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:27,576
Do you hear me, Farm?

12
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,203
I’m done thinking it through.

13
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,151
I’m sorry.

14
00:00:30,368 --> 00:00:32,392
Even if your feelings aren’t real,

15
00:00:32,392 --> 00:00:35,253
mine have been real ever since I was seven.

16
00:00:35,253 --> 00:00:38,801
If I ever see a vision where we break up,

17
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:40,355
I will get rid of it all.

18
00:00:47,221 --> 00:00:50,333
(I never thought one day 
I’d write something so cliché,)

19
00:00:50,702 --> 00:00:52,356
(like the dramas I watched as a kid.)

20
00:00:52,943 --> 00:00:54,470
(But bear with me and keep reading,)

21
00:00:54,905 --> 00:00:57,015
(and don’t laugh at me just yet, asshole.)

22
00:00:57,884 --> 00:00:59,740
(I honestly don’t know 
how to make this sound cool.)

23
00:01:00,544 --> 00:01:03,549
(The brain of a dying person 
can’t be more creative.)

24
00:01:05,092 --> 00:01:08,953
(If you’re reading this letter, 
that means I’m no longer in this world.)

25
00:01:09,735 --> 00:01:12,151
(Even though the time 
we were together was short,)

26
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:16,202
(whether it was real love 
or just pity on your part,)

27
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:20,395
(I thank you for making
the last moments of my life happy.)

28
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:25,531
(After today, January 21, 
I won’t be sharing your birthday anymore.)

29
00:01:26,118 --> 00:01:27,867
(You can have this birthday all to yourself.)

30
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,622
(For your 31st birthday, I wish—)

31
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,137
(No.)

32
00:01:32,832 --> 00:01:34,806
(This wish goes for the rest of your life.)

33
00:01:35,566 --> 00:01:38,493
(I wish every wish Jerome makes 
from now on would come true.)

34
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,633
(From Jinn.)

35
00:01:57,786 --> 00:01:59,393
I wish I could fix this.

36
00:02:04,803 --> 00:02:06,681
I wish we had more time to love each other.

37
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:09,935
I wish everything…

38
00:02:11,413 --> 00:02:12,400
didn’t end this way.

39
00:03:51,826 --> 00:03:52,510
Jan.

40
00:03:53,422 --> 00:03:54,439
What’s wrong?

41
00:03:54,895 --> 00:03:56,063
Our son didn’t disappear.

42
00:03:56,063 --> 00:03:57,947
He just spent the night 
at the house across the road.

43
00:03:59,359 --> 00:04:00,974
Stop making that worried face, Jan.

44
00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:04,719
You know I’m not worried about that.

45
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:09,997
I’ll do everything to make Jinn accept me.

46
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:13,962
No matter how long it takes 
or how hard it is,

47
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:15,469
I’ll make it happen.

48
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:22,943
I’m sorry I never told our son
that you’ve always been taking care of us.

49
00:04:23,682 --> 00:04:24,593
Jan.

50
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:27,063
Everything happens for a reason.

51
00:04:27,671 --> 00:04:34,387
We made that choice because we wanted 
Jinn to grow up as well as possible.

52
00:04:34,604 --> 00:04:36,288
Without having to deal with adult problems.

53
00:04:37,722 --> 00:04:40,474
And he grew up wonderfully. Right?

54
00:04:43,733 --> 00:04:44,673
So don’t stress yourself out.

55
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,070
Giving in just this once 
won’t make you lose face.

56
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:56,707
You can do it.

57
00:05:04,138 --> 00:05:06,853
Come on. I’ll wait right here.

58
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:08,950
If anything happens, 
you can run straight to me.

59
00:05:09,732 --> 00:05:14,304
I promise I’ll be here,
with open arms, holding you tight.

60
00:05:29,508 --> 00:05:30,782
Will you come inside with me?

61
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:45,514
I’ll leave for now.

62
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:48,893
Hi, Auntie Jan, Uncle Jet.

63
00:05:51,022 --> 00:05:51,792
This woman…

64
00:05:53,595 --> 00:05:54,700
I’ve been taking the best care of her.

65
00:05:56,004 --> 00:05:58,286
If you’re in her life, help me take care of her.

66
00:05:58,916 --> 00:05:59,753
Don’t hurt her.

67
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:02,513
Huh?

68
00:06:09,379 --> 00:06:10,146
Do you mean—

69
00:06:10,146 --> 00:06:11,110
Don’t you understand what I said?

70
00:06:14,326 --> 00:06:15,035
Jinn.

71
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,720
Your dad’s been taking care of me
since before you were born.

72
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,952
Mom!

73
00:06:18,952 --> 00:06:19,833
That’s all right.

74
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,181
I don’t mind being second to you

75
00:06:24,502 --> 00:06:25,369
Good then.

76
00:06:26,195 --> 00:06:27,370
Don’t cut in line.

77
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,680
Very egotistical, right?

78
00:06:37,136 --> 00:06:38,441
That’s good enough.

79
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:42,068
Ever since you two started living together,

80
00:06:42,198 --> 00:06:44,002
what have you been feeding my son, J?

81
00:06:44,545 --> 00:06:46,218
He’s lost most of his stubbornness.

82
00:06:47,848 --> 00:06:49,176
Nothing.

83
00:06:49,393 --> 00:06:50,562
I didn’t do anything.

84
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:52,360
Does this mean…

85
00:06:54,294 --> 00:06:58,130
the visions that you saw will change?

86
00:07:02,302 --> 00:07:03,210
Ah.

87
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:06,199
I told Uncle Jet about it.

88
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,017
I’m sorry, but I have to be honest here.

89
00:07:13,799 --> 00:07:15,367
I really don’t know.

90
00:07:18,713 --> 00:07:20,459
But if something really happens to me,

91
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,154
at least Jinn has 
his dad and you looking after him.

92
00:07:25,893 --> 00:07:27,111
I have no worries.

93
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,339
Jan, don’t say things like that.

94
00:07:36,174 --> 00:07:38,691
Nothing is going to 
happen to anyone, Auntie Jan.

95
00:07:52,051 --> 00:07:52,948
Van. Van.

96
00:07:53,491 --> 00:07:54,749
Do you have plans this evening?

97
00:07:55,553 --> 00:07:56,682
I don’t think so.

98
00:07:56,834 --> 00:07:57,924
What’s up, Grace?

99
00:07:58,163 --> 00:08:01,123
Mook’s throwing 
a birthday party near campus.

100
00:08:01,558 --> 00:08:04,042
She wanted to invite you, 
but she was too shy.

101
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:15,553
Happy birthday, Mook.

102
00:08:15,553 --> 00:08:16,988
But I don’t think I can make it.

103
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:19,203
I wish you all the happiness.

104
00:08:20,898 --> 00:08:23,732
Van, I saw that 
you unfollowed me on Instagram.

105
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:24,958
Are you mad at me or something?

106
00:08:25,892 --> 00:08:27,804
Ah, no. Why would I be mad?

107
00:08:28,108 --> 00:08:28,841
I just…

108
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,952
I’m talking to someone right now,

109
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,390
so I want to focus on them.

110
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,600
Someone like you?

111
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,094
Again, happy birthday.

112
00:08:37,768 --> 00:08:38,422
Let’s go.

113
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:44,922
Hey.

114
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,143
I know you don’t like my way of doing it.

115
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:51,792
But someone like me has to quit cold turkey.

116
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:56,067
It’s good that you want to 
be a better version of yourself.

117
00:08:57,132 --> 00:08:58,748
But just don’t lose who you are.

118
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:04,348
You know I like you for who you are, right?

119
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:07,700
Wait a minute.

120
00:09:09,004 --> 00:09:12,143
Did you just say you like me?

121
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,224
Slow down.

122
00:09:17,028 --> 00:09:18,627
My plan to win you back 
has only just started.

123
00:09:18,996 --> 00:09:20,109
You’re already soft for me?

124
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:22,849
Van.

125
00:09:24,544 --> 00:09:27,965
I know I’m so cute,

126
00:09:28,465 --> 00:09:30,473
and you wouldn’t stay cold forever,

127
00:09:31,733 --> 00:09:33,459
but I didn’t think it’d be this fast.

128
00:09:33,763 --> 00:09:35,279
You caught me off guard.

129
00:09:38,691 --> 00:09:39,512
Time for class.

130
00:09:40,033 --> 00:09:40,841
Give me a kiss first!

131
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,516
Try to be casual about it.

132
00:09:56,364 --> 00:09:57,690
It’s just parents getting back together.

133
00:09:59,732 --> 00:10:01,396
Do you really think it’ll work out?

134
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:04,545
What if he leaves my mom and me again?

135
00:10:05,045 --> 00:10:06,617
I was still young back then,

136
00:10:07,464 --> 00:10:09,799
but the image of my mom crying 
is still clear in my mind.

137
00:10:11,602 --> 00:10:12,854
And if something like that happens again—

138
00:10:12,854 --> 00:10:14,283
But the truth Auntie Jan just told us…

139
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:17,921
He never really left you or her, did he?

140
00:10:18,595 --> 00:10:21,416
Uncle Jet has always 
been looking out for you from afar.

141
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,033
That’s true.

142
00:10:28,293 --> 00:10:30,030
He chose to leave because

143
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:33,962
he didn’t want you or Auntie Jan to get hurt.

144
00:10:34,158 --> 00:10:36,012
His fans were vicious.

145
00:10:36,251 --> 00:10:39,849
His family offered no acceptance.

146
00:10:40,262 --> 00:10:45,016
I think that choice made him suffer 
just as much as everyone else.

147
00:10:45,429 --> 00:10:46,203
Mm.

148
00:10:47,463 --> 00:10:48,703
I…

149
00:10:49,572 --> 00:10:50,197
I believe you.

150
00:10:53,109 --> 00:10:54,519
Good boy.

151
00:10:57,952 --> 00:10:58,587
Hey.

152
00:10:58,913 --> 00:10:59,655
Hm?

153
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:02,544
Now that everything’s changed,

154
00:11:03,044 --> 00:11:04,443
what about the vision

155
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,469
you had about my mom?

156
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:11,011
Will she be okay now?

157
00:11:12,315 --> 00:11:13,583
I honestly don’t know.

158
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:17,395
But at least one thing has changed.

159
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,951
Your family is whole again.

160
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,699
From now on, 
let’s take good care of each other.

161
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:27,720
Okay?

162
00:11:36,503 --> 00:11:37,638
What are you two running away from?

163
00:11:38,485 --> 00:11:39,246
No.

164
00:11:39,507 --> 00:11:40,461
Nothing.

165
00:11:43,785 --> 00:11:45,189
Why are your cheeks flushed?

166
00:11:48,426 --> 00:11:49,086
Don’t think so.

167
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:50,601
Maybe it’s hot outside.

168
00:12:10,284 --> 00:12:11,124
What’s the matter?

169
00:12:11,602 --> 00:12:13,505
Oh, it’s just my alarm.

170
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:15,625
I have people come clean 
my house three times a month.

171
00:12:16,429 --> 00:12:17,399
You hire housekeepers?

172
00:12:18,507 --> 00:12:20,933
Yeah. I need to go home to let them in.

173
00:12:22,215 --> 00:12:24,620
You can just cancel them.

174
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,120
What?

175
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:28,840
I’ll take you there 
and we’ll clean your house together.

176
00:12:31,816 --> 00:12:32,513
Mm.

177
00:12:34,534 --> 00:12:35,221
Okay.

178
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:48,840
Uh… I just…

179
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,051
Do these go to Mom’s room?

180
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,358
J, help me carry them.

181
00:13:21,933 --> 00:13:22,685
Why are you smiling?

182
00:13:36,738 --> 00:13:37,437
What are you doing?

183
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,335
You did great.

184
00:13:40,552 --> 00:13:41,420
Did what great?

185
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,242
About Uncle Jet.

186
00:13:45,524 --> 00:13:46,871
You keep getting better.

187
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,374
Your reward.

188
00:13:57,111 --> 00:13:58,020
Also your reward.

189
00:13:58,216 --> 00:13:59,726
Pretty sure it’s not.

190
00:14:01,182 --> 00:14:02,537
That was your reward too.

191
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,627
J…

192
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,453
That’s not all.

193
00:14:17,234 --> 00:14:18,141
You should praise yourself.

194
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,927
It was you who 
gave me the courage to say it.

195
00:14:23,035 --> 00:14:25,186
So do I get a reward too?

196
00:14:30,097 --> 00:14:30,755
Yes.

197
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:46,239
I want to go there.

198
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:47,300
This looks familiar.

199
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,703
It’s like the place my mom 
took me to when I was young.

200
00:14:49,507 --> 00:14:50,664
I have an announcement.

201
00:14:50,903 --> 00:14:52,213
Jinn and I…

202
00:14:52,343 --> 00:14:53,922
We are boyfriends.
