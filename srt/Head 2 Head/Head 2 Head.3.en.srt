4
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:15,142
You boys are going to live together.

5
00:00:15,142 --> 00:00:19,946
And most importantly, you will help
each other with everything in daily life.

6
00:00:19,946 --> 00:00:20,732
I’m helping.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,922
You don’t have to look at me with heart eyes.

8
00:00:24,953 --> 00:00:28,068
I know I’m totally cool right now.

9
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,928
J!

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,450
What’s up with him?

11
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:35,436
Even when you’re single,
you’ve got your buddy driving you around.

12
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:36,411
He’s my hubby.

13
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,562
Don’t play—some ghostly force
might push you two together.

14
00:00:44,576 --> 00:00:46,377
Jinn, help me here.

15
00:00:46,377 --> 00:00:47,430
Ask nicely.

16
00:00:49,943 --> 00:00:51,664
Say ‘please’.

17
00:00:53,575 --> 00:00:54,823
Can you please help Nong?

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,778
Hey, jerk.

19
00:01:28,216 --> 00:01:28,942
J.

20
00:01:32,722 --> 00:01:34,225
Asshole, what the hell are you doing?!

21
00:01:34,375 --> 00:01:35,020
Ouch.

22
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:41,910
My hand, you dickhead.

23
00:01:43,156 --> 00:01:45,025
Don’t be such a baby. I didn’t push that hard.

24
00:01:49,578 --> 00:01:50,764
Does it really hurt?

25
00:01:54,351 --> 00:01:56,447
My hand hit the floor. You saw that.

26
00:01:56,962 --> 00:01:59,151
It’s a broken finger, not a scratch.

27
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:02,313
Can’t you be gentle with me?

28
00:02:07,446 --> 00:02:08,809
Well, you were just—

29
00:02:08,809 --> 00:02:10,616
What? I was just what?

30
00:02:12,313 --> 00:02:13,524
You were messing with me!

31
00:02:13,524 --> 00:02:14,024
Ouch.

32
00:02:15,441 --> 00:02:16,091
Ow.

33
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:21,981
With this hand,

34
00:02:22,819 --> 00:02:24,512
I don’t think I can keep working.

35
00:02:24,512 --> 00:02:26,178
I know it’s just your bullshit.

36
00:02:27,553 --> 00:02:28,911
But I’ll help.

37
00:02:30,114 --> 00:02:33,592
Consider it payback for... making you hurt.

38
00:02:36,534 --> 00:02:38,731
When you’re this tame and obedient,

39
00:02:41,158 --> 00:02:42,346
you’re kinda cute.

40
00:02:48,741 --> 00:02:53,997
F*ck. You. Jerk.

41
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:00,968
Damn it.

42
00:03:07,433 --> 00:03:08,698
Why won’t it screw in?!

43
00:03:21,913 --> 00:03:22,644
Jinn.

44
00:03:27,111 --> 00:03:28,629
What do you think…

45
00:03:30,626 --> 00:03:32,170
we’ll be doing 10 years from now?

46
00:05:32,436 --> 00:05:34,383
Mai, what the hell
are you doing in my faculty?

47
00:05:34,383 --> 00:05:38,084
Hey, junior. Make sure to follow my design.

48
00:05:38,084 --> 00:05:39,664
Yeah, please fix it.

49
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:41,040
Mai!

50
00:05:41,255 --> 00:05:42,751
Be quiet, will you, asshole?

51
00:05:43,975 --> 00:05:44,679
Why are you here?

52
00:05:45,323 --> 00:05:46,316
To see something.

53
00:05:46,896 --> 00:05:47,528
See what?

54
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,816
Just you wait.

55
00:05:50,746 --> 00:05:51,396
What?

56
00:05:54,811 --> 00:05:55,579
They came together.

57
00:05:56,653 --> 00:05:57,308
Always.

58
00:05:58,382 --> 00:06:00,390
I told you something’s up.

59
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,772
What’s with the twitchy eyes, Mai?

60
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,168
I can help massage them with my foot.

61
00:06:05,769 --> 00:06:07,678
Nothing. The light is just too bright.

62
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:08,826
I’m all good.

63
00:06:09,341 --> 00:06:10,153
Good.

64
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:11,739
What’s up, you two?

65
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:12,497
You came together again.

66
00:06:12,733 --> 00:06:14,053
You even pulled a chair out for him.

67
00:06:15,277 --> 00:06:17,367
What exactly is this relationship?

68
00:06:17,904 --> 00:06:19,678
You’ll be seeing this for a whole month.

69
00:06:19,871 --> 00:06:21,318
Better get used to it.

70
00:06:21,404 --> 00:06:22,967
You think I’m happy about this?

71
00:06:23,482 --> 00:06:26,942
I tell myself every day
that he’ll get better tomorrow.

72
00:06:27,135 --> 00:06:28,778
It just never comes true.

73
00:06:28,778 --> 00:06:29,416
Nonsense!

74
00:06:30,941 --> 00:06:32,995
If it healed that fast,

75
00:06:32,995 --> 00:06:34,735
it wouldn’t be a broken bone.

76
00:06:34,735 --> 00:06:36,218
Ever heard of sarcasm?

77
00:06:36,648 --> 00:06:38,113
I’m not that dumb.

78
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,955
Well, you’re usually dumb.

79
00:06:40,062 --> 00:06:42,838
I thought that was just
your regular dumb self talking.

80
00:06:44,148 --> 00:06:44,812
Hey!

81
00:06:46,122 --> 00:06:47,419
Quit fighting like kids.

82
00:06:47,526 --> 00:06:49,384
I honestly feel bad for your moms.

83
00:06:49,556 --> 00:06:52,099
Is it a good idea for them
to punish you two like this?

84
00:06:52,185 --> 00:06:54,039
Every investment has risks.

85
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,255
If their sons don’t end up
kissing each other...

86
00:06:57,598 --> 00:06:59,694
Someone’s definitely gonna die.

87
00:06:59,694 --> 00:07:00,479
Exactly.

88
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:02,857
- You’re the first, Mai.
- Oh, I’m dead?

89
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:15,274
Jinn, open your eyes.

90
00:07:15,424 --> 00:07:16,074
Jinn.

91
00:07:17,362 --> 00:07:18,373
Jinn, wake up.

92
00:07:18,373 --> 00:07:19,748
- Don’t die.
- J.

93
00:07:19,963 --> 00:07:20,696
J.

94
00:07:22,586 --> 00:07:23,590
J!

95
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:24,955
What?

96
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,036
You’ve got terrible hearing.

97
00:07:29,754 --> 00:07:31,077
I’m going downstairs to grab some snacks.

98
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:32,359
Anyone want to join me?

99
00:07:33,347 --> 00:07:35,612
I’ve been sitting here for like five minutes.

100
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:37,401
And now you want me to walk again?

101
00:07:37,487 --> 00:07:38,430
Meaning?

102
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,484
Of course, I’m coming. I’m hungry.

103
00:07:39,484 --> 00:07:40,407
- Nice.
- Let’s go.

104
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:40,907
You want anything?

105
00:07:41,014 --> 00:07:42,307
Nah, I’m good. Go ahead.

106
00:07:42,307 --> 00:07:44,431
- Coming?
- No. You go.

107
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:47,537
- Come on, hurry.
- Don’t take forever.

108
00:07:49,048 --> 00:07:49,830
Mai, come on.

109
00:07:59,762 --> 00:08:01,040
What is it, Farm?

110
00:08:02,457 --> 00:08:03,400
I should ask you.

111
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:05,033
Is there anything you want to tell me?

112
00:08:11,272 --> 00:08:12,821
Have you…

113
00:08:13,723 --> 00:08:15,481
ever dreamed about
the same thing over and over?

114
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,035
What?

115
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,538
Well,

116
00:08:20,526 --> 00:08:21,879
every time I dream…

117
00:08:22,867 --> 00:08:24,671
there’s always this one person in it,

118
00:08:24,929 --> 00:08:27,066
just in different situations.

119
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:31,109
Is the one you’re dreaming of a real person?

120
00:08:31,195 --> 00:08:31,938
Yes.

121
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,855
I don’t think that’s weird.

122
00:08:35,757 --> 00:08:38,615
When I watch a movie
or listen to music before bed,

123
00:08:38,615 --> 00:08:39,745
I end up dreaming about them too.

124
00:08:42,107 --> 00:08:42,819
Really?

125
00:08:43,915 --> 00:08:44,622
Yeah.

126
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:47,370
If someone’s always around you,

127
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:49,831
it’s not weird to dream about them, right?

128
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,256
What if I told you I…

129
00:08:59,373 --> 00:09:00,075
You what?

130
00:09:02,652 --> 00:09:04,377
Everything I see in my dreams…

131
00:09:05,043 --> 00:09:06,537
always comes true.

132
00:09:08,792 --> 00:09:10,102
Are you saying…

133
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,397
you can see the future?

134
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:18,421
Mhm.

135
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,915
Damn.

136
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,162
We’ll take some of these, please.

137
00:09:24,162 --> 00:09:25,476
Grab whatever you like.

138
00:09:26,163 --> 00:09:27,474
100 baht.

139
00:09:27,474 --> 00:09:28,827
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

140
00:09:29,858 --> 00:09:31,506
You eat this kind of stuff now?

141
00:09:31,678 --> 00:09:33,627
Ah, these are for Farm. He likes them.

142
00:09:34,357 --> 00:09:36,924
By the way, now that you’re staying
at Farm’s place, how’s it going?

143
00:09:36,924 --> 00:09:39,319
Is he still as prissy as usual?

144
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,547
Even worse.

145
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:43,582
He’s so freaking clean.

146
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:48,234
Even his dirty clothes
are folded in the laundry basket.

147
00:09:48,234 --> 00:09:49,014
- What?
- What?

148
00:09:49,486 --> 00:09:50,281
I’m serious.

149
00:09:51,205 --> 00:09:53,555
Our laundry baskets are next to each other.

150
00:09:53,555 --> 00:09:55,956
Mine looks like a pile of
rotten veggies from the market.

151
00:09:55,956 --> 00:09:56,750
Can you picture that?

152
00:09:57,222 --> 00:09:59,588
Shit, yeah. I can totally see it.

153
00:10:00,426 --> 00:10:02,095
So are you staying there long term?

154
00:10:02,224 --> 00:10:04,832
Will you move out
when you get a new partner?

155
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,105
I’m giving my heart a break.

156
00:10:08,298 --> 00:10:09,333
A break, huh?

157
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:10,966
Sadhu!

158
00:10:11,396 --> 00:10:12,721
Hope you actually give it a rest this time.

159
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:16,179
Hey, I don’t want the same plot, though.

160
00:10:16,179 --> 00:10:19,951
The flirty playboy and the cranky roommate.

161
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:21,042
Like hell!

162
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:22,879
I agree.

163
00:10:23,051 --> 00:10:24,713
Farm’s a very good person.

164
00:10:24,906 --> 00:10:26,152
I don’t care who you mess with.

165
00:10:26,152 --> 00:10:28,611
But please don’t mess with friends.

166
00:10:29,707 --> 00:10:31,778
I’m not that evil.

167
00:10:31,778 --> 00:10:32,670
- You are!
- You are!

168
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:35,979
Fine.

169
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:38,012
I promise I won’t hurt him.

170
00:10:40,267 --> 00:10:42,039
Your response sounded kinda ambiguous.

171
00:10:42,039 --> 00:10:43,082
It does.

172
00:10:43,082 --> 00:10:44,599
I won’t hurt him.

173
00:10:45,565 --> 00:10:46,825
Damn you.

174
00:10:46,954 --> 00:10:48,309
Were you a snake in your past life?

175
00:10:48,309 --> 00:10:49,912
You just slither right out of everything.

176
00:10:49,912 --> 00:10:51,676
Yeah, I’m anaconda.

177
00:10:51,826 --> 00:10:53,443
You’re terrible.

178
00:11:01,353 --> 00:11:03,085
Mai asked if we’re down for a party tonight.

179
00:11:03,515 --> 00:11:04,394
You go.

180
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:05,745
If you get too drunk, call me.

181
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:06,422
I’ll come pick you up.

182
00:11:06,658 --> 00:11:08,224
No.

183
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,841
Come with me.

184
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:13,507
I don’t like parties. You know that.

185
00:11:13,722 --> 00:11:14,951
Not going.

186
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:18,383
J and Jinn have to
go home like good little boys.

187
00:11:18,383 --> 00:11:21,549
If it’s just me and Mai, it’ll be so freaking dull.

188
00:11:22,988 --> 00:11:25,033
I’m not going.

189
00:11:30,102 --> 00:11:31,504
Just come with me, please.

190
00:11:32,936 --> 00:11:35,034
Yeah, come with me.

191
00:11:42,214 --> 00:11:44,359
EXAMINATION ROOM 3

192
00:11:46,547 --> 00:11:47,239
So?

193
00:11:47,346 --> 00:11:48,347
What did the doctor say?

194
00:11:48,347 --> 00:11:49,232
Will you be fully healed by tomorrow?

195
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:50,764
Tomorrow, my ass.

196
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,069
You kicked me yesterday.
That’s why it got inflamed.

197
00:11:53,821 --> 00:11:55,176
I’m getting more meds.

198
00:11:56,142 --> 00:11:58,269
You’re made of glass.

199
00:11:58,763 --> 00:11:59,909
So fragile.

200
00:12:01,498 --> 00:12:03,273
You don’t even feel guilty for what you did.

201
00:12:04,175 --> 00:12:05,410
We need more meds, right?

202
00:12:05,582 --> 00:12:06,627
Come on. Let’s go.

203
00:12:06,992 --> 00:12:07,755
Hurry up.

204
00:12:07,755 --> 00:12:09,565
Come on, J.

205
00:12:22,626 --> 00:12:23,676
Why’d you stop?

206
00:12:28,229 --> 00:12:32,964
Even when I’m sixty or seventy, you still
have to buy me strawberry ice cream.

207
00:12:36,314 --> 00:12:37,098
Why are you spacing out?

208
00:12:40,277 --> 00:12:42,823
Hey, I want some ice cream.

209
00:12:43,188 --> 00:12:43,702
Huh?

210
00:12:44,132 --> 00:12:46,655
Just do it. Go buy it for me.

211
00:12:47,342 --> 00:12:48,322
You can get it yourself.

212
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,711
It’s less than 10 steps away.

213
00:12:50,914 --> 00:12:52,458
I want strawberry ice cream.

214
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,380
Freaking unbelievable.

215
00:13:09,604 --> 00:13:10,249
Here.

216
00:13:21,854 --> 00:13:23,055
Ew!

217
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,219
It tastes so bad.

218
00:13:28,398 --> 00:13:30,527
Then toss it. Why did you give it to me?

219
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:32,820
I didn’t want to waste it.

220
00:13:33,164 --> 00:13:34,764
Thought maybe you’d eat it.

221
00:13:37,169 --> 00:13:40,839
I really hate it when you make that face.

222
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:42,492
It looks like you’re up to some shit.

223
00:13:42,492 --> 00:13:43,915
Just eat.

224
00:13:44,774 --> 00:13:45,955
If you don’t like it, throw it away.

225
00:13:55,963 --> 00:13:56,907
It’s pretty good.

226
00:14:02,234 --> 00:14:03,055
Are you in a hurry?

227
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,204
Why?

228
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,352
I’m thinking of dropping by to see Mom.

229
00:14:06,975 --> 00:14:07,682
Sure.

230
00:14:13,459 --> 00:14:15,782
So you really like strawberry ice cream?

231
00:14:19,288 --> 00:14:20,266
Why did you stop?

232
00:14:20,932 --> 00:14:22,554
Your hand hurts, not your legs.

233
00:14:22,661 --> 00:14:23,646
Keep walking.

234
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,598
Yeah.

235
00:14:28,421 --> 00:14:32,241
When we’re alone, he’s actually kinda lovely.

236
00:14:32,928 --> 00:14:35,748
Even though I change partners a lot,

237
00:14:36,994 --> 00:14:38,969
I was always sincere.

238
00:14:54,358 --> 00:14:56,379
Hi. Welcome.

239
00:14:58,352 --> 00:15:01,205
- Oops.
- I missed you, gorgeous.

240
00:15:01,674 --> 00:15:02,619
Gosh.

241
00:15:03,023 --> 00:15:04,825
You scared me.

242
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:07,041
Hello, Auntie Jan.

243
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,359
Oh, J, you’re here too.

244
00:15:09,928 --> 00:15:11,447
That’s unexpected.

245
00:15:12,337 --> 00:15:15,219
I’m not used to seeing
you two show up together.

246
00:15:16,643 --> 00:15:22,272
Well, someone tied us together
like a pair of deep-fried dough sticks.

247
00:15:22,919 --> 00:15:23,541
Ouch.

248
00:15:23,816 --> 00:15:26,779
You still haven’t said why you’re here.

249
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:33,416
I took J to the hospital nearby
to get his wound cleaned,

250
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:36,609
so I dropped by to see my gorgeous mom.

251
00:15:38,518 --> 00:15:39,167
Right.

252
00:15:39,571 --> 00:15:40,550
Stay for dinner, then.

253
00:15:40,825 --> 00:15:41,828
Perfect!

254
00:15:41,957 --> 00:15:46,639
Eating with J always kills my appetite.

255
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:51,050
Should I tell Auntie Jen you said that?

256
00:15:51,422 --> 00:15:52,649
Ow, don’t pinch me.

257
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:53,954
If she hears it,

258
00:15:54,229 --> 00:15:55,152
your punishment’s getting extended.

259
00:15:55,152 --> 00:15:56,990
Please don’t tell my mom, Auntie Jan.

260
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,910
Me and this ass—

261
00:15:58,751 --> 00:16:01,015
I mean, we don’t hate each other anymore.

262
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:04,872
But everyone still prefers
their own pillow and their own bed.

263
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:06,165
That’s true, Mom.

264
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,716
Like Nui Sujira once said,

265
00:16:08,716 --> 00:16:12,093
“Salmons may live out in the ocean,

266
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,937
but in the end, they always
swim upstream to lay eggs in freshwater.”

267
00:16:18,563 --> 00:16:19,479
Do you get what I mean?

268
00:16:25,157 --> 00:16:26,748
What the hell was that salmon talk?

269
00:16:28,479 --> 00:16:30,252
Why? Isn’t it sharp?

270
00:16:30,705 --> 00:16:32,665
If our punishment gets extended,

271
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:34,359
that’s on you.

272
00:16:34,925 --> 00:16:35,990
How come?

273
00:16:36,136 --> 00:16:39,047
Next time, if you don’t know
what to say, just make a sad face.

274
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:40,132
Let me handle the rest.

275
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:42,670
Okay?

276
00:16:43,382 --> 00:16:43,882
Okay.

277
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,998
I’ve visited
Auntie Jan’s boutique so many times,

278
00:16:52,224 --> 00:16:53,906
but I never knew this room existed.

279
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,713
It’s a shame he’s not so famous anymore.

280
00:17:02,217 --> 00:17:04,384
If he were, I could sell
this photo for a fortune.

281
00:17:04,627 --> 00:17:05,268
Jinn.

282
00:17:10,234 --> 00:17:15,058
Who’d believe I’m the son of
the country’s number one actor back then?

283
00:17:15,932 --> 00:17:17,732
I can’t even believe it myself.

284
00:17:17,732 --> 00:17:19,118
Does he ever visit you?

285
00:17:19,749 --> 00:17:21,047
He would’ve been exposed if he did.

286
00:17:21,726 --> 00:17:23,341
He forgot he even had Mom and me.

287
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,897
But it’s fine. We’re happy, just the two of us.

288
00:17:28,512 --> 00:17:30,415
Auntie Jan’s amazing

289
00:17:31,321 --> 00:17:32,845
for raising you on her own.

290
00:17:32,942 --> 00:17:33,649
Yeah,

291
00:17:33,843 --> 00:17:35,087
I know my mom is great.

292
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,543
You might be a douche sometimes,

293
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:40,633
but overall, not a bad human being.

294
00:17:41,717 --> 00:17:42,217
Wait.

295
00:17:42,379 --> 00:17:43,933
I’m helping Auntie Jan set the table.

296
00:17:48,993 --> 00:17:51,650
I can’t even be nice to you
for one second, can I, dickhead?

297
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:54,225
Did I get carried away?

298
00:17:55,018 --> 00:17:55,783
Damn it.

299
00:17:57,271 --> 00:17:58,683
We’re not at home,

300
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,951
so I didn’t get to show off my cooking skills.

301
00:18:01,404 --> 00:18:04,296
Your food delivery skills
are good enough, ma’am.

302
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:07,614
J, eat up.

303
00:18:08,439 --> 00:18:10,873
So you’ll have the energy to fight my son.

304
00:18:11,067 --> 00:18:12,277
- Of course.
- Can I get some too?

305
00:18:12,277 --> 00:18:13,496
Yeah? Alright, here.

306
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,693
He always starts—

307
00:18:16,356 --> 00:18:17,832
Jinn’s not that bad.

308
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,239
When we’re alone, he’s actually kinda lovely.

309
00:18:23,128 --> 00:18:23,693
Huh?

310
00:18:24,874 --> 00:18:26,532
Did I hear that right?

311
00:18:26,904 --> 00:18:28,759
Did you just say Jinn is lovely?

312
00:18:31,121 --> 00:18:32,237
I’m serious.

313
00:18:32,577 --> 00:18:34,171
When he’s asleep,

314
00:18:34,749 --> 00:18:36,010
he looks like a newborn kitten.

315
00:18:39,104 --> 00:18:40,015
Is that so?

316
00:18:45,272 --> 00:18:45,772
Jinn.

317
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,210
Yes, Mom?

318
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,069
What about J?

319
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:49,113
You haven’t said anything about him.

320
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:51,794
Well…

321
00:18:52,909 --> 00:18:53,739
He’s—

322
00:18:54,257 --> 00:18:54,984
Ouch!

323
00:18:57,637 --> 00:18:58,661
What was that?

324
00:19:00,048 --> 00:19:01,002
Was it a rat?

325
00:19:02,053 --> 00:19:02,799
So?

326
00:19:03,511 --> 00:19:04,321
He’s…

327
00:19:05,356 --> 00:19:06,994
a very lovely person.

328
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:14,086
That’s great.

329
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,386
But seriously,
what ran past my feet just now?

330
00:19:18,515 --> 00:19:19,595
I don’t think there’s a rat here.

331
00:19:21,229 --> 00:19:22,779
Bye-bye. I love you.

332
00:19:22,779 --> 00:19:23,523
Bye.

333
00:19:23,669 --> 00:19:24,994
Bye-bye.

334
00:19:28,569 --> 00:19:31,400
Holy shit, I can’t believe
I actually called you lovely.

335
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,467
Newborn kitten.

336
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,323
- Gosh.
- Ugh.

337
00:19:36,554 --> 00:19:39,501
Our lives get weirder every day.

338
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:43,392
What else will we be forced
to do until your hand heals?

339
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:46,138
I just can’t.

340
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:47,598
It’s ridiculous.

341
00:20:14,657 --> 00:20:16,371
Hello!

342
00:20:16,533 --> 00:20:17,667
Hello!

343
00:20:18,589 --> 00:20:19,574
What are you guys doing here?

344
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:24,148
Since you didn’t come party with us...

345
00:20:24,261 --> 00:20:26,846
we brought the party to you instead.

346
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:28,918
- Yay!
- Yay!

347
00:20:29,749 --> 00:20:30,727
Set it up, Mai.

348
00:20:30,727 --> 00:20:31,723
You got it, sir.

349
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,482
This looks mouthwatering.

350
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,666
I just can’t wait.

351
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,455
Check this out. Look.

352
00:20:36,455 --> 00:20:38,208
We won’t let you down.

353
00:20:38,386 --> 00:20:39,516
Are you out of your mind?

354
00:20:39,749 --> 00:20:40,952
We can’t finish all this.

355
00:20:41,502 --> 00:20:42,255
This?

356
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:43,804
Piece of cake.

357
00:20:43,804 --> 00:20:46,245
Less talking, more drinking.

358
00:20:52,846 --> 00:20:53,600
Van.

359
00:20:53,908 --> 00:20:54,408
Hm?

360
00:20:54,408 --> 00:20:54,973
Sit up properly.

361
00:20:56,332 --> 00:20:59,094
This is proper sitting.

362
00:21:00,323 --> 00:21:02,055
You’re such an ass!

363
00:21:03,284 --> 00:21:04,673
I said sit up straight.

364
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,723
I used to think you were a heavyweight

365
00:21:09,063 --> 00:21:11,037
since you hang out at bars every other day.

366
00:21:11,361 --> 00:21:14,457
Now I know you’re just there to fish.

367
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:15,395
Sure!

368
00:21:15,848 --> 00:21:17,010
I’m an asshole!

369
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:21,490
That’s why I never find
true love like everyone else.

370
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,478
That’s because you’re everything
but true love to your partners.

371
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:30,031
Mai, don’t be too hard on him.

372
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,882
Even though I change partners a lot,

373
00:21:37,707 --> 00:21:39,432
I was always sincere.

374
00:21:40,483 --> 00:21:42,271
It wasn’t just about sleeping with them.

375
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:47,198
They just weren’t the right ones yet.

376
00:21:47,538 --> 00:21:49,516
So I had to end it.

377
00:21:49,678 --> 00:21:51,489
And when are you gonna meet the right one?

378
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:52,490
Hm?

379
00:22:20,387 --> 00:22:21,380
You’re drunk, Van.

380
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:22,991
Go to bed.

381
00:22:25,563 --> 00:22:26,242
I’m not drunk.

382
00:22:28,992 --> 00:22:30,484
Cheers!

383
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,981
- Enough.
- Hey, let me drink.

384
00:22:32,981 --> 00:22:35,079
You should learn to take care of yourself.

385
00:22:35,483 --> 00:22:38,171
Be more like me.

386
00:22:38,171 --> 00:22:41,391
You hit those bars too often.

387
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,669
Start thinking about your future.

388
00:22:43,669 --> 00:22:46,806
You can’t keep wasting time being dissolute.

389
00:22:46,806 --> 00:22:47,474
Understood?

390
00:22:47,895 --> 00:22:48,593
Good.

391
00:22:52,898 --> 00:22:54,509
Shit, when did you guys leave?

392
00:23:00,365 --> 00:23:01,129
What were you thinking,

393
00:23:01,453 --> 00:23:03,231
making your crush your roommate?

394
00:23:58,573 --> 00:23:59,790
- Oh, shit!
- Jinn, watch out!

395
00:23:59,964 --> 00:24:00,464
Geez!

396
00:24:02,122 --> 00:24:03,123
Why did you shout?

397
00:24:06,304 --> 00:24:06,997
You all right?

398
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,370
Your car was gonna crash.

399
00:24:26,336 --> 00:24:27,586
Yeah, in the game,

400
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:29,280
Did you have to be so shocked?

401
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,400
Don’t ask so many questions.

402
00:24:31,843 --> 00:24:32,673
I’m having a headache.

403
00:25:15,238 --> 00:25:16,813
Bad headache?

404
00:25:20,071 --> 00:25:20,699
Mm.

405
00:25:25,538 --> 00:25:27,232
Want to see a doctor? I can take you.

406
00:25:29,642 --> 00:25:30,298
No.

407
00:25:34,148 --> 00:25:35,986
Why don’t you get up and take some pills?

408
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,685
Take some—

409
00:25:40,685 --> 00:25:41,396
Damn it!

410
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:43,182
Just leave me alone!

411
00:26:16,137 --> 00:26:17,485
It’s already late.

412
00:26:18,063 --> 00:26:19,415
You can crash here tonight.

413
00:26:19,415 --> 00:26:20,622
We’ll go to uni together tomorrow.

414
00:26:21,509 --> 00:26:24,507
You just take care of
everyone in the world, don’t you?

415
00:26:24,893 --> 00:26:27,588
If you weren’t my friend, I’d totally hit on you.

416
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:30,524
Mai, you know I don’t like it
when people joke like that.

417
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:31,366
Why?

418
00:26:32,041 --> 00:26:33,430
Got a secret crush on a friend or something?

419
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:34,038
Mai!

420
00:26:36,236 --> 00:26:40,464
What were you thinking,
making your crush your roommate?

421
00:26:41,775 --> 00:26:42,608
You know?

422
00:26:44,054 --> 00:26:45,186
I’m your friend.

423
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:47,435
You can’t hide it from me for long.

424
00:26:47,743 --> 00:26:48,645
And honestly,

425
00:26:49,069 --> 00:26:51,758
I think J and Jinn already know too.

426
00:26:53,358 --> 00:26:55,329
Where’s everyone?!

427
00:26:55,676 --> 00:26:57,320
Why are you up, Van?

428
00:26:57,610 --> 00:26:59,279
Let’s keep drinking!

429
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:00,928
Look at yourself.

430
00:27:01,391 --> 00:27:01,891
Oh!

431
00:27:02,797 --> 00:27:03,547
Yeah, it’s a cigarette.

432
00:27:04,125 --> 00:27:05,037
Can I get some?

433
00:27:05,345 --> 00:27:07,036
No, you can’t.

434
00:27:07,402 --> 00:27:08,757
Don’t do this, Van.

435
00:27:09,143 --> 00:27:10,315
- I can’t?
- Right.

436
00:27:13,226 --> 00:27:14,731
Then what can I get?

437
00:27:20,403 --> 00:27:20,938
You—

438
00:27:53,594 --> 00:27:54,465
He’s drunk.

439
00:27:55,294 --> 00:27:56,729
You don’t have to tell him anything.

440
00:28:02,108 --> 00:28:04,378
It’s my feeling. I can deal with it.

441
00:28:05,515 --> 00:28:06,823
Don’t bother him with it.

442
00:28:08,751 --> 00:28:11,473
Let’s just say I didn’t see anything.

443
00:29:05,594 --> 00:29:06,269
Jinn.

444
00:29:09,453 --> 00:29:10,813
I…

445
00:29:11,546 --> 00:29:12,161
I’m sorry.

446
00:29:13,954 --> 00:29:14,670
What?!

447
00:29:15,595 --> 00:29:17,296
For lashing out at you last night.

448
00:29:20,901 --> 00:29:22,644
I’m… sorry.

449
00:29:26,114 --> 00:29:28,040
Who are you? You’re possessing my friend.

450
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:28,752
I know what to do.

451
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:32,826
Get out! Shoo!

452
00:29:34,098 --> 00:29:34,937
It’s a ghost.

453
00:29:35,535 --> 00:29:36,694
Who the hell shooes a ghost like it’s a dog?

454
00:29:38,294 --> 00:29:40,292
You just admitted it? What are you?

455
00:29:40,292 --> 00:29:41,422
A Dracula? A crazy dog spirit?

456
00:29:41,422 --> 00:29:43,290
A filth-eating spirit? An ogre? Frankenstein?

457
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:43,908
Cut it out!

458
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:45,397
You idiot.

459
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:50,277
J, you dickhead.

460
00:29:51,854 --> 00:29:53,541
Ugh, my shoe’s stuck.

461
00:29:55,218 --> 00:29:55,918
- Boo!
- Jeez!

462
00:29:57,923 --> 00:29:59,095
Damn you, J.
You wanna fight?

463
00:30:15,408 --> 00:30:16,501
You okay there, Van?

464
00:30:16,501 --> 00:30:17,278
I’m all good.

465
00:30:17,278 --> 00:30:18,589
You don’t look so good.

466
00:30:26,628 --> 00:30:29,502
I didn’t know you slept in my room last night.

467
00:30:29,884 --> 00:30:33,753
Don’t tell me you don’t remember
anything from last—

468
00:30:33,753 --> 00:30:34,603
Ahem!

469
00:30:35,837 --> 00:30:38,179
I remember vaguely.

470
00:30:38,179 --> 00:30:40,120
No need to remind him about last night.

471
00:30:40,698 --> 00:30:42,477
He gets weird when he’s drunk.

472
00:30:42,631 --> 00:30:44,264
People always say I’m cute when I’m drunk.

473
00:30:44,264 --> 00:30:46,173
You’re the only one who says I’m weird.

474
00:30:49,797 --> 00:30:51,116
Am I really not cute?

475
00:30:52,793 --> 00:30:54,149
Just buckle up.

476
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,919
Cold as ever.

477
00:30:57,362 --> 00:30:58,937
- Van.
- Yes?

478
00:30:59,033 --> 00:31:00,425
Behave.

479
00:31:04,979 --> 00:31:05,951
You’re staring.

480
00:31:06,838 --> 00:31:08,114
Do you want a problem, dear?

481
00:31:08,596 --> 00:31:12,252
How many times
do I have to say I don’t like this?

482
00:31:12,850 --> 00:31:13,518
I’m sorry.

483
00:31:13,518 --> 00:31:15,548
Why do you have to be so serious?

484
00:31:15,548 --> 00:31:17,180
Friends don’t do this.

485
00:31:17,855 --> 00:31:20,137
Hey, nice weather today.

486
00:31:20,137 --> 00:31:20,895
I feel like walking to uni.

487
00:31:20,895 --> 00:31:21,803
Don’t be so grumpy.

488
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,219
I’m just playing.

489
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,068
If you don’t feel anything,
no need to get all worked up.

490
00:31:26,164 --> 00:31:27,619
What if someone does feel it?

491
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:30,632
Someone, please get me out of here.

492
00:31:31,095 --> 00:31:31,962
What are you saying?

493
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:35,319
You’re the player. You’re having fun.

494
00:31:35,743 --> 00:31:37,614
But if you’re the one getting played,

495
00:31:38,077 --> 00:31:39,247
it won’t be fun anymore.

496
00:31:41,329 --> 00:31:42,366
I’m sorry, Farm.

497
00:31:42,366 --> 00:31:44,021
Don’t be so mad.

498
00:31:44,252 --> 00:31:45,331
I read too much into it.

499
00:31:45,331 --> 00:31:47,009
Sorry, I took it out on you.

500
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,744
Put on your seltbelt. We’re taking off.

501
00:31:49,744 --> 00:31:51,174
Yeah, I’m taking off too. I’m outta here.

502
00:31:51,174 --> 00:31:52,218
Stay, Mai.

503
00:32:02,217 --> 00:32:04,482
You didn’t even invite us to your party.

504
00:32:11,114 --> 00:32:13,133
As if you’d have time for us.

505
00:32:13,403 --> 00:32:16,549
All you do now is
babysit your new best friend.

506
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:20,532
It’s mandatory.

507
00:32:20,686 --> 00:32:22,453
How many times
do I have to tell you he’s limping?

508
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:25,711
Right, “mandatory.”

509
00:32:26,347 --> 00:32:28,756
So, when are you two
going back to the circuit?

510
00:32:29,045 --> 00:32:30,301
Tar misses you.

511
00:32:30,706 --> 00:32:32,506
He still misses them?

512
00:32:32,699 --> 00:32:36,583
If I were him, I’d blacklist them both.

513
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:38,760
They’d be totally banned
after almost wrecking the track.

514
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,747
That had nothing to do with me.

515
00:32:40,075 --> 00:32:41,117
I didn’t do anything.

516
00:32:41,117 --> 00:32:42,681
He’s the one responsible.

517
00:32:42,681 --> 00:32:44,024
But you guys were racing.

518
00:32:44,236 --> 00:32:45,091
But he was the one who crashed.

519
00:32:45,091 --> 00:32:45,669
Hey.

520
00:32:46,922 --> 00:32:48,957
Did you figure out what’s happening to you?

521
00:32:52,408 --> 00:32:52,946
No.

522
00:32:53,467 --> 00:32:55,134
But I didn’t dream about anything last night.

523
00:32:55,308 --> 00:32:58,265
Maybe it’s a side effect of the crash.

524
00:32:58,265 --> 00:32:59,109
What do you think?

525
00:33:02,444 --> 00:33:04,014
I hope so.

526
00:33:04,824 --> 00:33:08,109
I think you should consult a doctor.

527
00:33:08,707 --> 00:33:10,450
How am I supposed to explain it to a doctor?

528
00:33:11,549 --> 00:33:14,046
I can’t even wrap my head
around it when I talk to you.

529
00:33:14,354 --> 00:33:15,601
Then keep observing yourself.

530
00:33:16,121 --> 00:33:17,613
Whatever it is, you can talk to me.

531
00:33:17,729 --> 00:33:18,603
Or Jinn.

532
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,767
Yeah.

533
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:22,765
I’m sleepy.

534
00:33:23,498 --> 00:33:24,200
I’m gonna take a nap.

535
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:24,700
Hey.

536
00:33:25,394 --> 00:33:26,068
What about the assignment?

537
00:33:26,511 --> 00:33:28,599
Do it for me, please.

538
00:33:40,322 --> 00:33:41,969
You know, I’ve been writing this

539
00:33:42,547 --> 00:33:45,227
since high school, and in college too.

540
00:33:45,632 --> 00:33:46,769
It’s not something I just started.

541
00:33:48,003 --> 00:33:51,919
You didn’t seem like the type
who’d do anything like this back then.

542
00:33:52,690 --> 00:33:53,641
No surprise there.

543
00:33:54,084 --> 00:33:55,822
You didn’t know me that well.

544
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,591
I don’t even know if “write” is the right word.

545
00:34:00,034 --> 00:34:00,933
Let’s just say I “complain” in here.

546
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,101
I jot down whatever’s bothering me.

547
00:34:06,007 --> 00:34:07,129
Hm…

548
00:34:12,276 --> 00:34:13,545
There’s something about you in here too.

549
00:34:17,285 --> 00:34:18,030
Are you okay, J?

550
00:34:22,122 --> 00:34:23,148
Is it happening again?

551
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,229
Are you alright?

552
00:34:27,846 --> 00:34:28,770
I am.

553
00:34:29,156 --> 00:34:30,125
I’m gonna skip today.

554
00:34:41,647 --> 00:34:42,310
Farm.

555
00:34:44,623 --> 00:34:47,301
What did you mean by
“Is it happening again?”

556
00:34:52,815 --> 00:34:55,387
I was sleepy, so I went to nap somewhere.

557
00:34:55,541 --> 00:34:57,321
Should I call Auntie Jen and ask her
to book you a doctor’s appointment?

558
00:34:57,321 --> 00:34:58,430
Are you worried about me?

559
00:35:42,334 --> 00:35:43,849
There’s something about you in here too.

560
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,137
There’s something about you in here too.

561
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:00,248
Long time no see, J.

562
00:36:02,449 --> 00:36:02,972
Beam.

563
00:36:11,104 --> 00:36:12,169
What did he tell you?

564
00:36:14,291 --> 00:36:15,075
Nothing.

565
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:18,754
He just said he couldn’t sleep
and had weird dreams.

566
00:36:18,754 --> 00:36:19,842
That’s all.

567
00:36:22,024 --> 00:36:23,817
Why are you suddenly suspicious of J?

568
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:25,711
Did he do something weird to you?

569
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:26,683
Hell yeah.

570
00:36:26,901 --> 00:36:28,031
He’s been acting strange.

571
00:36:28,428 --> 00:36:29,764
Sometimes he just zones out,

572
00:36:29,764 --> 00:36:30,938
like he’s deep in thought.

573
00:36:31,632 --> 00:36:33,389
Sometimes he just freezes.

574
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:36,728
Gosh, I can’t even explain it.

575
00:36:36,728 --> 00:36:37,728
You’ve gotta see it yourself.

576
00:36:37,887 --> 00:36:39,779
Maybe he’s always been like that.

577
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:41,770
You just didn’t care enough to notice before.

578
00:36:42,821 --> 00:36:43,374
You think?

579
00:36:43,374 --> 00:36:44,596
Nah, I’m just talking nonsense.

580
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:47,843
Mai, you dick!

581
00:36:47,843 --> 00:36:49,073
That’s Mai junior down there.

582
00:36:51,552 --> 00:36:53,059
It’s not just J who’s weird.

583
00:36:53,872 --> 00:36:55,095
You’re weird too, Jinn.

584
00:36:55,749 --> 00:36:57,271
- Me?
- Mm.

585
00:36:58,501 --> 00:36:59,428
Weird how?

586
00:36:59,587 --> 00:37:01,021
You two were always fighting before.

587
00:37:01,338 --> 00:37:02,483
Look at you now.

588
00:37:03,475 --> 00:37:05,133
What about me now?

589
00:37:07,057 --> 00:37:09,550
You seem to care a lot about him.

590
00:37:15,936 --> 00:37:17,865
- Aw!
- Aw!

591
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:20,219
I don’t care, okay?

592
00:37:20,219 --> 00:37:21,954
I’m just scared he’ll die in my room.

593
00:37:23,263 --> 00:37:25,481
I just bought that condo, you know?

594
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,512
I don’t want his ghost haunting the place.

595
00:37:27,512 --> 00:37:29,768
Ah! So that’s the reason.

596
00:37:29,768 --> 00:37:31,052
I guess it makes sense.

597
00:37:46,997 --> 00:37:47,893
Have you been well?

598
00:37:49,123 --> 00:37:49,736
Yeah.

599
00:37:51,838 --> 00:37:53,412
We haven’t seen each other in a while.

600
00:37:56,327 --> 00:37:57,264
How’s your injury?

601
00:37:59,684 --> 00:38:02,786
It’s broken, so it’s gonna take time to heal.

602
00:38:05,469 --> 00:38:10,423
I heard you’re staying at Jinn’s place now.

603
00:38:11,811 --> 00:38:12,664
You knew?

604
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:16,070
It’s hard to believe.

605
00:38:16,506 --> 00:38:20,311
Two people who hate
each other’s guts are living together.

606
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,238
Well, it’s…

607
00:38:22,615 --> 00:38:23,649
It’s a long story.

608
00:38:24,006 --> 00:38:25,563
I’m sure it is.

609
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,921
That must be why you
haven’t reached out since that day.

610
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:32,032
Are you dumping me, J?

611
00:38:35,126 --> 00:38:39,389
I heard you and Jinn are always competing.

612
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,419
It sounded fun at first.

613
00:38:43,768 --> 00:38:46,568
But I didn’t think I’d be the prize.

614
00:38:47,469 --> 00:38:48,717
Once you guys got me, I was tossed aside.

615
00:38:49,312 --> 00:38:50,233
It’s all me.

616
00:38:50,550 --> 00:38:51,421
Jinn had nothing to do with that.

617
00:38:53,285 --> 00:38:54,693
Wow.

618
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:58,196
So not only are you done fighting,
now you’re defending each other too.

619
00:39:01,587 --> 00:39:02,393
I’m sorry.

620
00:39:03,444 --> 00:39:04,145
Good.

621
00:39:04,522 --> 00:39:05,883
I appreciate the honesty.

622
00:39:06,061 --> 00:39:07,437
Makes it easier for me to move on.

623
00:39:20,308 --> 00:39:21,174
What’s this veggie called again?

624
00:39:21,174 --> 00:39:22,596
Is it… malindjo something?

625
00:39:22,675 --> 00:39:23,822
This is stir-fried malindjo leaves with eggs.

626
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:25,157
Right, stir-fried malindjo leaves with eggs.

627
00:39:25,157 --> 00:39:25,657
Hey.

628
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:27,735
Where have you been?

629
00:39:28,072 --> 00:39:29,313
I thought you were dead.

630
00:39:30,999 --> 00:39:33,620
I was sleepy, so I went to nap somewhere.

631
00:39:34,334 --> 00:39:36,332
Why do you nap so damn much?

632
00:39:36,451 --> 00:39:38,483
It’s like that’s all you do.

633
00:39:38,483 --> 00:39:39,865
Maybe you should get checked out.

634
00:39:39,984 --> 00:39:41,404
You’re getting your
wound cleaned today, right?

635
00:39:42,693 --> 00:39:45,321
Take him to the doctor
and ask what’s wrong with him.

636
00:39:46,808 --> 00:39:47,930
Nothing’s wrong.

637
00:39:48,862 --> 00:39:51,247
I just haven’t slept well.
It’s not my own place, that’s all.

638
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:55,874
You can use that excuse with the ladies.

639
00:39:56,132 --> 00:39:57,245
Should we tell them?

640
00:39:57,899 --> 00:40:01,281
Maybe they’ll go soft and let you go home.

641
00:40:01,618 --> 00:40:03,721
Trying your luck, huh?

642
00:40:05,605 --> 00:40:06,978
I’ll adjust soon enough.

643
00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:10,890
Gosh. How boring.

644
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:12,482
Are you done eating?

645
00:40:12,621 --> 00:40:13,972
If you are, we can head to the hospital.

646
00:40:16,749 --> 00:40:18,411
Don’t just eat the rice.

647
00:40:18,411 --> 00:40:19,086
Take it easy.

648
00:40:19,304 --> 00:40:20,697
Return this plate for me.

649
00:40:22,423 --> 00:40:23,201
- Later.
- Later.

650
00:40:25,462 --> 00:40:26,202
Come on.

651
00:40:28,721 --> 00:40:31,388
I never thought I’d see that.

652
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,918
Normally, they’d start
a fistfight just by looking at each other.

653
00:40:34,255 --> 00:40:35,793
Now they’re glued together,

654
00:40:36,011 --> 00:40:37,432
driving each other around,

655
00:40:37,432 --> 00:40:38,485
and even sleeping under the same roof.

656
00:40:39,001 --> 00:40:40,079
If they end up together,

657
00:40:40,158 --> 00:40:41,562
the world might just burn.

658
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,597
It’s no good.

659
00:40:43,212 --> 00:40:45,133
Being friends is perfect as it is.

660
00:40:46,164 --> 00:40:49,786
But friends can turn into lovers.

661
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:51,275
Right?

662
00:40:54,607 --> 00:40:57,220
Yeah, but it shouldn’t apply to close friends.

663
00:40:58,985 --> 00:41:00,366
Friends are friends.

664
00:41:00,762 --> 00:41:02,129
Don’t over-categorize.

665
00:41:02,446 --> 00:41:03,723
You should categorize sometimes.

666
00:41:04,636 --> 00:41:06,030
I’ll just eat.

667
00:41:14,096 --> 00:41:14,763
J.

668
00:41:16,369 --> 00:41:18,112
Should I call Auntie Jen and ask her
to book you a doctor’s appointment?

669
00:41:22,059 --> 00:41:23,241
I’m really fine.

670
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:26,398
Are you sure?

671
00:41:31,334 --> 00:41:32,015
What?

672
00:41:32,828 --> 00:41:33,849
Are you worried about me?

673
00:41:39,923 --> 00:41:41,416
I’d rather worry about a dog than you.

674
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,454
There’s something about you in here too.

675
00:42:07,307 --> 00:42:07,997
Really?

676
00:42:09,524 --> 00:42:13,026
How come I’ve never
seen this notebook before?

677
00:42:13,641 --> 00:42:14,807
How would you?

678
00:42:14,966 --> 00:42:18,048
I hid it in my underwear drawer.

679
00:42:27,634 --> 00:42:28,766
I want to go to your place.

680
00:42:31,245 --> 00:42:32,741
But you need to get your wound cleaned.

681
00:42:32,939 --> 00:42:34,273
We’re almost at the hospital.

682
00:42:35,701 --> 00:42:36,686
Turn the car around, Jinn.

683
00:42:37,896 --> 00:42:39,935
J, are you out of your mind?

684
00:42:39,935 --> 00:42:40,845
I want to go back to the condo.

685
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:42,205
Now.

686
00:42:45,517 --> 00:42:47,103
Fine. Alright.

687
00:42:48,214 --> 00:42:49,332
If your wound gets infected, don’t blame me.

688
00:43:14,388 --> 00:43:14,894
Hey.

689
00:43:16,679 --> 00:43:18,053
What is the matter with this dude?

690
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:42,950
J, why did you lock the door?

691
00:43:43,327 --> 00:43:44,234
It’s my room.

692
00:43:47,469 --> 00:43:48,253
Hey, jerk-face.

693
00:43:52,259 --> 00:43:53,573
Open up.

694
00:43:56,805 --> 00:43:57,491
J.

695
00:44:06,316 --> 00:44:07,272
J!

696
00:44:07,961 --> 00:44:10,351
It’s my room. I said open up.

697
00:44:20,484 --> 00:44:22,312
Fine. You wanna do this?

698
00:44:24,236 --> 00:44:25,469
I’ve got the key.

699
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:42,575
(Being this close to you...

700
00:44:42,952 --> 00:44:45,579
how am I supposed to stop myself
from feeling something for you?)

701
00:44:56,155 --> 00:44:57,722
You prick. Why are you touching my stuff?!

702
00:44:58,099 --> 00:44:58,599
Jinn.

703
00:44:58,599 --> 00:44:59,281
What the hell’s wrong with you?

704
00:44:59,281 --> 00:45:00,141
It’s my personal stuff!

705
00:45:00,954 --> 00:45:01,572
Jinn.

706
00:45:01,572 --> 00:45:02,764
Just go home.

707
00:45:04,291 --> 00:45:05,649
Stay the hell away from me. Leave!

708
00:45:05,649 --> 00:45:06,149
Jinn.

709
00:45:06,466 --> 00:45:07,159
Damn it!

710
00:45:07,595 --> 00:45:08,796
- Jinn!
- What?!

711
00:45:08,796 --> 00:45:09,774
- Hear me out first.
- Let go of me!

712
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:11,030
No.

713
00:45:17,694 --> 00:45:18,555
Just listen to me.

714
00:45:18,555 --> 00:45:19,193
Hands off me!

715
00:45:19,193 --> 00:45:20,494
Hear me out!

716
00:45:24,762 --> 00:45:25,930
Do you still like me?

717
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,202
Does it bother you,

718
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:52,404
knowing I still have feelings for you?

719
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,733
You must be wondering
why I’m hugging you.

720
00:46:00,082 --> 00:46:01,830
Can you not ask questions right now?

721
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:06,072
Everyone wants true love, don’t they?

722
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:08,920
But before you can have it,

723
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,459
you need to learn to be that for someone.

724
00:46:15,326 --> 00:46:17,018
What even counts as true love?

725
00:46:18,763 --> 00:46:20,224
Can I even be that for you?

726
00:46:22,822 --> 00:46:24,783
When did we start hating on each other?

727
00:46:24,922 --> 00:46:26,174
I really can’t recall.

728
00:46:28,574 --> 00:46:29,670
I’m in the lead.

729
00:46:29,670 --> 00:46:30,315
Hey!

730
00:46:30,315 --> 00:46:31,363
I never hated you.
