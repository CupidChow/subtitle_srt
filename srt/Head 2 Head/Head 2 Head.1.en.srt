4

J.

5
00:00:46,076 --> 00:00:46,632
J.

6
00:00:49,406 --> 00:00:50,077
J.

7
00:00:52,435 --> 00:00:53,325
J!

8
00:00:55,897 --> 00:00:56,765
J, dear son.

9
00:01:00,859 --> 00:01:01,793
Wake up.

10
00:01:01,793 --> 00:01:03,195
Isn’t it your first day of the new semester?

11
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:04,798
Yes, Mom.

12
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:05,993
I’m awake.

13
00:01:06,808 --> 00:01:09,010
Then get out of bed.

14
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,122
Up!

15
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:13,468
Ouch, Mom.

16
00:01:13,468 --> 00:01:15,297
Stop hitting me like I’m still a little kid.

17
00:01:15,297 --> 00:01:16,814
Go take a shower.

18
00:01:16,814 --> 00:01:19,110
Your Chef Daddy already made breakfast.

19
00:01:19,646 --> 00:01:23,994
And don’t think you can nap in the bathroom,
or I’ll come in and smack you again.

20
00:01:24,358 --> 00:01:25,569
Yes, ma’am.

21
00:01:26,512 --> 00:01:27,144
Up!

22
00:01:35,513 --> 00:01:36,786
What the heck was that dream?

23
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:40,059
Mom, I’m off.

24
00:01:40,616 --> 00:01:42,085
Jinn, wait!

25
00:01:42,557 --> 00:01:45,590
Come home this Friday after class

26
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:47,380
so we can go make merit
for your birthday on Saturday morning.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,692
Can we not go to the temple?

28
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:52,736
Every time I see monks, I feel uneasy,
like I’m coming down with a fever.

29
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:53,790
You wicked one!

30
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,546
Don’t badmouth religious figures.

31
00:01:56,103 --> 00:01:57,336
I’m only joking, Gorgeous.

32
00:01:58,794 --> 00:02:01,805
Can I get a chocolate cake this year, though?

33
00:02:02,062 --> 00:02:02,562
Goodness!

34
00:02:03,548 --> 00:02:04,721
How can you ask for so little?

35
00:02:04,721 --> 00:02:05,550
And a car?

36
00:02:05,679 --> 00:02:07,044
No way!

37
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:08,610
I’m this close to taking that car back.

38
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,967
Don’t even joke about a new one.

39
00:02:09,967 --> 00:02:11,289
Fine, I don’t want one, Gorgeous.

40
00:02:11,653 --> 00:02:12,870
Drive safely, okay?

41
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,256
Yes, ma’am. Bye-bye.

42
00:02:14,514 --> 00:02:16,984
And don’t ever go to the racetrack
to race cars again.

43
00:02:16,984 --> 00:02:18,485
I’m not listening. I don’t hear anything.

44
00:02:18,485 --> 00:02:20,161
Be safe, Jinn!

45
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:41,759
What, honking for your dad?

46
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:42,401
Huh?

47
00:02:42,915 --> 00:02:44,113
Those honks were for your dad?

48
00:02:46,149 --> 00:02:49,145
My dad’s inside. Why would I honk for him?

49
00:02:50,002 --> 00:02:52,681
Tell your dad to
put his son right back in his balls

50
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:54,180
so he stops bothering people.

51
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,602
What a freaking pain in the ass!

52
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:57,439
What are you smiling at?

53
00:02:58,168 --> 00:02:59,077
What the hell are you smiling at?

54
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,429
You get worked up so easily.

55
00:03:02,429 --> 00:03:04,274
Careful not to get
your blood pressure up, dear.

56
00:03:05,046 --> 00:03:05,721
You jerk!

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,693
Hey!

58
00:03:07,508 --> 00:03:08,678
- Get off me.
- Damn it.

59
00:03:08,935 --> 00:03:09,790
I’ll get back at you.

60
00:03:10,755 --> 00:03:11,479
I’ll come for you.

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,606
Asshole.

62
00:04:12,882 --> 00:04:14,657
You lost again today,

63
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:16,523
Nong Jinn.

64
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:17,466
I’m not your junior.

65
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,709
I was even born before you. Don’t forget.

66
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,571
Yeah, by like seven minutes.

67
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:22,890
Are you so proud?

68
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:30,613
If we’re talking height,

69
00:04:30,784 --> 00:04:32,319
I should be your senior.

70
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:33,685
You’re just five centimeters taller.

71
00:04:33,942 --> 00:04:35,293
Don’t brag so much.

72
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:36,915
You’re so childish.

73
00:04:39,766 --> 00:04:42,246
Says the guy who brags
about being seven minutes older.

74
00:04:42,246 --> 00:04:43,385
Not childish at all.

75
00:04:43,985 --> 00:04:46,575
Have you ever counted how many years
you’ve been getting on my nerves?

76
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,000
Why would I?

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,234
Well, I don’t know.

78
00:04:49,491 --> 00:04:51,347
You’re always following me around.

79
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,383
I’m starting to think…

80
00:04:56,755 --> 00:04:57,991
you’ve got a secret crush on me.

81
00:04:59,877 --> 00:05:02,448
Are you sure
I’m the one with the secret crush?

82
00:05:03,069 --> 00:05:05,323
I know you’re a boy, Jerome.

83
00:05:05,323 --> 00:05:08,143
But why can’t two guys get married?

84
00:05:08,143 --> 00:05:10,031
I still like you, Jerome.

85
00:05:10,395 --> 00:05:12,295
Males have to be with females.

86
00:05:12,295 --> 00:05:13,249
Bleh!

87
00:05:13,249 --> 00:05:16,233
Jinn likes boys!

88
00:05:16,747 --> 00:05:17,413
Asshole!

89
00:05:17,756 --> 00:05:20,100
When will you stop bringing up
that story from when I was seven?

90
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:20,850
What the hell is wrong with you?

91
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:21,472
Huh?

92
00:05:22,029 --> 00:05:22,988
Answer me.

93
00:05:23,717 --> 00:05:26,141
Hi. You have morning classes?

94
00:05:26,141 --> 00:05:26,807
That’s right.

95
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:27,759
Do you have morning classes too, J?

96
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:28,371
That’s right.

97
00:05:28,714 --> 00:05:30,278
Two-faced jerk.

98
00:05:33,236 --> 00:05:35,188
I’ve gotta go. My friend’s already left.

99
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:36,895
- Bye-bye.
- Of course.

100
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,374
Shit.

101
00:07:14,928 --> 00:07:16,253
- What?
- What?

102
00:07:16,403 --> 00:07:19,832
Look, the duo arrives together again.

103
00:07:20,797 --> 00:07:23,818
You two must be best buds.

104
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:26,206
Best buds, my ass.

105
00:07:26,335 --> 00:07:27,871
Do I look like I want to come with him?

106
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:45,574
Van.

107
00:07:46,153 --> 00:07:46,765
How do I look?

108
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:48,731
Handsome as always, dude.

109
00:07:49,138 --> 00:07:50,014
This again, guys?

110
00:07:50,336 --> 00:07:52,081
Don’t you ever get tired of fighting?

111
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:53,281
Nope.

112
00:07:54,203 --> 00:07:56,178
It’s hella fun.

113
00:08:04,002 --> 00:08:05,197
Have you heard?

114
00:08:05,476 --> 00:08:06,402
Yes, I have.

115
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:09,461
So, what are you gonna do?

116
00:08:09,461 --> 00:08:10,338
Want payback?

117
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:10,999
No.

118
00:08:11,856 --> 00:08:15,298
If he wants to eat my leftovers that bad,
let him.

119
00:08:16,155 --> 00:08:19,127
Besides, I was kind of tired of Beam anyway.

120
00:08:19,427 --> 00:08:20,761
I was just thinking of dating someone new.

121
00:08:22,497 --> 00:08:25,007
But you once told me
you were serious about this one…

122
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:30,206
You two are too alike—

123
00:08:30,592 --> 00:08:33,799
born on the same day, same taste in people.

124
00:08:33,906 --> 00:08:34,996
Same taste?

125
00:08:35,167 --> 00:08:36,579
My type’s always been like this.

126
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:39,172
He’s the one who keeps
hitting on whoever I like.

127
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:41,798
You also keep trying to
beat him at everything.

128
00:08:41,798 --> 00:08:45,065
You guys are addicted to
competing with each other.

129
00:08:45,065 --> 00:08:46,396
Look what he’s done to me first.

130
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:48,493
This is your problem, dude.

131
00:08:48,664 --> 00:08:49,961
You’re easily triggered.

132
00:08:49,961 --> 00:08:51,134
That’s why you’re always at a disadvantage.

133
00:08:51,434 --> 00:08:52,436
See what J does?

134
00:08:52,565 --> 00:08:55,322
He competes with ease, stays calm.

135
00:08:56,415 --> 00:08:58,564
That’s why he keeps winning.

136
00:09:03,381 --> 00:09:04,528
He’s done it again.

137
00:09:04,528 --> 00:09:05,749
Right? He’s so hot, it’s cheating.

138
00:09:05,856 --> 00:09:07,866
You always get whoever you want.

139
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:09,706
Just walk up and ask for their number.

140
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:10,762
How hard can it be?

141
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:26,297
Why did you do it?

142
00:09:27,497 --> 00:09:28,272
Do what?

143
00:09:28,572 --> 00:09:29,932
You don’t even like guys.

144
00:09:30,747 --> 00:09:31,956
Are you just trying to mess with me?

145
00:09:31,956 --> 00:09:33,608
My type changes all the time.

146
00:09:33,844 --> 00:09:35,701
Don’t whine just because you can’t beat me.

147
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:42,749
You chicken!

148
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,382
J, you bastard!

149
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:49,632
Ouch.

150
00:09:51,321 --> 00:09:52,464
Ow! Mom!

151
00:09:52,764 --> 00:09:54,293
- Ouch!
- Don’t move.

152
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:56,746
Jan, just stop it.

153
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,187
The kids were just playing.

154
00:09:58,187 --> 00:09:59,107
I’m sure Jinn didn’t mean it.

155
00:09:59,107 --> 00:09:59,763
Right, dear?

156
00:09:59,763 --> 00:10:00,715
Yes, Auntie Jen.

157
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:01,982
Please help me.

158
00:10:01,982 --> 00:10:03,563
Don’t sweet-talk Auntie Jen.

159
00:10:03,563 --> 00:10:05,716
No one can help you.

160
00:10:05,716 --> 00:10:07,511
What is this? You two grew up together.

161
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:09,196
Your houses are opposite each other.

162
00:10:09,196 --> 00:10:10,440
You go to the same school.

163
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,565
Why are you always fighting?

164
00:10:12,565 --> 00:10:13,851
Just tell me why.

165
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,600
What if J got seriously injured?

166
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,892
How am I going to compensate Auntie Jen?

167
00:10:17,892 --> 00:10:18,982
J’s thick-skinned.

168
00:10:18,982 --> 00:10:20,206
A little punch won’t kill him.

169
00:10:20,914 --> 00:10:21,631
Ouch.

170
00:10:22,746 --> 00:10:23,701
Mom! It hurts!

171
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:25,071
Auntie Jan, it’s okay.

172
00:10:25,393 --> 00:10:26,871
Jinn probably didn’t mean it.

173
00:10:26,871 --> 00:10:28,198
Aw, my dear J.

174
00:10:28,198 --> 00:10:30,659
See how sweet he is?

175
00:10:30,659 --> 00:10:32,525
You were going to tell my mom anyway.

176
00:10:32,718 --> 00:10:34,627
Take off your mask and stop saying

177
00:10:34,627 --> 00:10:37,215
“Auntie Jan, Auntie Jan, he didn’t mean…”

178
00:10:37,215 --> 00:10:38,392
Auntie Jan, huh?

179
00:10:38,392 --> 00:10:40,545
If you hadn’t hit me,
none of this would have happened.

180
00:10:40,545 --> 00:10:41,361
You started it.

181
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:42,736
What? What did I do?

182
00:10:42,843 --> 00:10:43,766
- Stop!
- Stop!

183
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:45,962
- You’re both at fault.
- You’re both at fault.

184
00:10:47,462 --> 00:10:49,981
Hey, all you do is fight.

185
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:51,883
You’re grown now, you know?

186
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:54,208
You’ve been at each other’s throats
since you were little.

187
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,680
When are you gonna stop, sons?

188
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,352
I should just lock you two together
in a room until you learn.

189
00:11:00,438 --> 00:11:01,296
No, Mom.

190
00:11:01,296 --> 00:11:02,068
Who would want to live with him?

191
00:11:02,068 --> 00:11:02,718
Good idea.

192
00:11:03,618 --> 00:11:05,641
Ouch, it hurts!

193
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:06,875
Do you want to be whipped, too?

194
00:11:07,326 --> 00:11:08,969
Go shower and go to bed.

195
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:10,198
You’ve got school in the morning.

196
00:11:10,198 --> 00:11:10,892
Yes, Mom.

197
00:11:12,092 --> 00:11:13,355
I’m gonna get my payback.

198
00:11:13,355 --> 00:11:14,595
There’s nothing to pay.

199
00:11:15,195 --> 00:11:15,939
Goodbye, ma’am.

200
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:16,891
Hey, Jinn!

201
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:17,582
Where are you going?

202
00:11:17,582 --> 00:11:18,487
I’m not done with you yet.

203
00:11:18,487 --> 00:11:20,236
Go shower and go to bed.

204
00:11:21,136 --> 00:11:23,331
- These two.
- These two.

205
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,446
Master of two faces, I’d say.

206
00:11:25,596 --> 00:11:26,796
He’s never been sincere with anyone.

207
00:11:26,967 --> 00:11:28,040
He just wants to sleep with them.

208
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:30,527
You two are evil just the same.

209
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,284
I’m clearly much better.

210
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:34,470
Whatever. I don’t care.

211
00:11:41,269 --> 00:11:43,015
Pull it out first.

212
00:11:45,694 --> 00:11:47,323
Why do you keep staring at Jinn?

213
00:11:47,752 --> 00:11:49,047
Trying to bug him again?

214
00:11:50,033 --> 00:11:50,946
Who’s staring?

215
00:11:51,482 --> 00:11:52,942
I’m just looking around.

216
00:11:53,435 --> 00:11:56,629
And for the record, I never start the fights.

217
00:11:56,972 --> 00:11:57,963
He’s always the one who picks on me first.

218
00:11:57,963 --> 00:11:58,592
Are you sure?

219
00:11:59,299 --> 00:12:01,137
I see you start it every time.

220
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,990
Recently, you two were
even hitting on the same guy.

221
00:12:03,783 --> 00:12:04,500
What was his name, Beam?

222
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,701
Well, he chose me.

223
00:12:06,701 --> 00:12:07,742
What was I supposed to do?

224
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:08,826
And now what?

225
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:13,787
Seriously, is Beam really your type?

226
00:12:14,237 --> 00:12:16,624
Or do you just like him
because Jinn liked him first?

227
00:12:16,795 --> 00:12:18,411
You go after whoever Jinn’s into,

228
00:12:18,582 --> 00:12:20,981
and once you get them,
you dump them right after.

229
00:12:21,388 --> 00:12:23,514
Do you want to beat him that badly?

230
00:12:24,972 --> 00:12:25,806
I don’t know.

231
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:30,728
I guess the people Jinn likes
just seem more interesting than others.

232
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:43,531
(What the f*ck are you looking at, asshole?)

233
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,498
(Looking at an asshole.)

234
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,281
Move.

235
00:13:08,310 --> 00:13:10,209
Are you mad at me about Beam?

236
00:13:11,838 --> 00:13:12,453
No.

237
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:13,244
Oh?

238
00:13:13,244 --> 00:13:14,334
But I hate you.

239
00:13:15,041 --> 00:13:18,050
With or without Beam, I always hate you.

240
00:13:18,243 --> 00:13:20,826
So stay out of my life

241
00:13:20,826 --> 00:13:23,528
before my patience runs out
and I punch you in the face.

242
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:37,224
If it’s not about Beam, then…

243
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:43,390
you’re jealous of me?

244
00:13:53,186 --> 00:13:54,186
Jealous, my ass.

245
00:13:54,186 --> 00:13:54,969
I hate you.

246
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,585
I hate Jerome! I hate Jerome!

247
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:30,522
Jinn!

248
00:14:31,272 --> 00:14:34,456
Does someone like you ever get serious with anyone?

249
00:14:34,627 --> 00:14:36,362
How about I get serious with you?

250
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,598
Are you sure you looked everywhere?

251
00:14:49,115 --> 00:14:50,448
You really didn’t take it by mistake?

252
00:14:55,904 --> 00:14:58,140
Yeah, I can’t find it.

253
00:14:59,997 --> 00:15:01,839
Oh, shit.

254
00:15:02,988 --> 00:15:05,951
What are you looking for, Nong Jinn?

255
00:15:08,382 --> 00:15:09,371
I gotta go.

256
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:15,946
Is this what you’re looking for?

257
00:15:18,052 --> 00:15:19,891
I was generous enough to keep it for you.

258
00:15:20,293 --> 00:15:22,994
A thank you would be really nice.

259
00:15:22,994 --> 00:15:25,400
Someone like you would do that for me?

260
00:15:26,127 --> 00:15:26,735
Give it back!

261
00:15:28,496 --> 00:15:29,176
J!

262
00:15:50,192 --> 00:15:51,361
Taking advantage of me?

263
00:15:52,223 --> 00:15:54,217
It’s not good to be so handsy.

264
00:15:54,964 --> 00:15:56,061
Then give it back.

265
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:58,710
Ha!

266
00:16:01,695 --> 00:16:02,297
Hey!

267
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,455
Shit.

268
00:16:08,987 --> 00:16:09,930
Holy shit.

269
00:16:10,523 --> 00:16:12,248
My car key.

270
00:16:27,268 --> 00:16:28,634
Climb up there and get it, J.

271
00:16:29,285 --> 00:16:30,802
If you hadn’t tried to snatch it,
it wouldn’t have ended up there.

272
00:16:30,802 --> 00:16:31,821
So you’re blaming me?

273
00:16:32,702 --> 00:16:34,386
You’re the one who stole it.

274
00:16:34,386 --> 00:16:35,513
The hell I stole it.

275
00:16:35,838 --> 00:16:37,888
You dropped it in the bathroom,
so I picked it up for you.

276
00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:40,569
If you really meant well,

277
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,361
why didn’t you give it back right away?

278
00:16:43,988 --> 00:16:44,703
See?

279
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:47,207
You can’t think of more bullshit.

280
00:16:47,513 --> 00:16:49,766
Wow, you’re just—

281
00:16:51,795 --> 00:16:52,295
Hey.

282
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:53,351
Hey!

283
00:17:02,195 --> 00:17:04,378
Aim better.

284
00:17:09,725 --> 00:17:10,830
Ouch, J!

285
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:12,499
Watch me. Watch and learn.

286
00:17:12,499 --> 00:17:13,122
Yeah, do it yourself.

287
00:17:13,122 --> 00:17:13,812
Watch.

288
00:17:20,263 --> 00:17:20,989
What now?

289
00:17:21,946 --> 00:17:23,756
We might need a different strategy.

290
00:17:25,058 --> 00:17:25,803
What?

291
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,351
Stand on your toes.

292
00:17:28,849 --> 00:17:29,975
I am standing on my toes!

293
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:31,262
Hurry up.

294
00:17:31,262 --> 00:17:32,701
Hurry? Why don’t you do it?

295
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:34,339
Just pick it. Stop turning and talking to me.

296
00:17:34,339 --> 00:17:36,093
Damn. You’re taller, but your heart’s tiny.

297
00:17:36,093 --> 00:17:37,429
Afraid of heights? What a chicken!

298
00:17:38,865 --> 00:17:41,186
Gosh! J!

299
00:17:41,512 --> 00:17:42,439
What the hell are you laughing at?

300
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:43,222
It’s not funny.

301
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,295
I got it. I got it.

302
00:17:52,645 --> 00:17:53,610
We did it.

303
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,574
We did it.

304
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,288
- Hey.
- Hey.

305
00:18:12,906 --> 00:18:14,324
- Yuck.
- Ew.

306
00:18:18,804 --> 00:18:20,105
Are you hurt anywhere?

307
00:18:20,737 --> 00:18:21,956
Geez! You’re bleeding.

308
00:18:25,593 --> 00:18:26,663
It’s your cheek’s fault.

309
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:29,124
Not only does it smell bad,
but it also injured me.

310
00:18:31,862 --> 00:18:33,051
How did you know it smells bad?

311
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:34,573
Did you sniff it?

312
00:18:36,266 --> 00:18:37,834
As if I wanted to sniff it.

313
00:18:39,135 --> 00:18:39,838
Here, get this.

314
00:18:43,219 --> 00:18:44,234
Come and get it.

315
00:18:46,034 --> 00:18:47,172
Damn you, J.

316
00:19:08,965 --> 00:19:11,266
If it weren’t for you,
I’d be sleeping on the street tonight.

317
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,324
Your girlfriend kicks you out every other day.
Don’t you get used to it by now?

318
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:20,132
And stop acting like
you don’t have a home to go back to.

319
00:19:20,304 --> 00:19:21,236
Well, my home is far.

320
00:19:21,619 --> 00:19:23,488
It can’t compare to
your condo near campus.

321
00:19:24,713 --> 00:19:26,261
Behave yourself, will you?

322
00:19:26,452 --> 00:19:29,080
One partner a month doesn’t make you cool.

323
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,230
It just makes you an asshole.

324
00:19:30,651 --> 00:19:31,590
Copy that, Father.

325
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,277
I got it.

326
00:19:34,478 --> 00:19:38,929
Seriously though, does someone like you
ever get serious with anyone?

327
00:19:39,159 --> 00:19:40,963
How about I get serious with you?

328
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:42,142
You jerk.

329
00:19:42,506 --> 00:19:43,958
I hate it when you joke like that.

330
00:19:44,264 --> 00:19:44,872
Why?

331
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:49,281
Afraid you’ll end up falling for me, babe?

332
00:19:51,808 --> 00:19:54,109
Go shower before I kick you out.

333
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:55,825
Fine.

334
00:19:57,778 --> 00:19:58,917
Kiss, kiss, baby.

335
00:20:00,927 --> 00:20:01,561
Ow!

336
00:20:02,728 --> 00:20:04,027
Stop spouting nonsense.

337
00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:05,017
Kiss, kiss.

338
00:20:27,542 --> 00:20:28,139
Watch it.

339
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:29,301
Damn it.

340
00:20:31,266 --> 00:20:32,096
Shit.

341
00:20:52,234 --> 00:20:52,786
Jinn!

342
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:05,614
What the?!

343
00:21:29,095 --> 00:21:30,565
I think this one should be a turtleneck.

344
00:21:30,565 --> 00:21:34,924
Why do we have to
make clothes again this semester?!

345
00:21:35,421 --> 00:21:37,549
Gosh, I’m exhausted!

346
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:41,479
You’re studying fashion.

347
00:21:41,709 --> 00:21:43,171
What the hell else would you do
if not make clothes?

348
00:21:43,171 --> 00:21:43,881
Sing?

349
00:21:44,187 --> 00:21:45,345
I’m just tired, okay?

350
00:21:45,594 --> 00:21:48,366
My brain’s got zero design ideas left.

351
00:21:48,366 --> 00:21:50,528
Who the heck put me in this major?

352
00:21:50,605 --> 00:21:51,413
You did.

353
00:21:52,179 --> 00:21:54,208
You said you wanted to flirt with pretty girls.

354
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,248
Did you forget?

355
00:21:55,363 --> 00:21:56,735
Flirt, my ass!

356
00:21:57,118 --> 00:21:59,646
The girls here all act like they’re my mom.

357
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:08,709
Sorry, we’re just being motherly!

358
00:22:11,446 --> 00:22:13,026
I’m sorry, Mommy.

359
00:22:13,026 --> 00:22:14,535
“Mommy,” my freaking ass.

360
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,316
Leave me out of it.

361
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:17,869
Stop flirting around,

362
00:22:18,214 --> 00:22:20,109
or your girlfriend’s gonna show up
and slap you again.

363
00:22:20,224 --> 00:22:20,890
What girlfriend?

364
00:22:21,266 --> 00:22:21,796
I’m single.

365
00:22:21,796 --> 00:22:22,404
- What?!
- What?!

366
00:22:22,595 --> 00:22:23,337
- Single?
- Single?

367
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,365
That’s right.

368
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:26,734
I am.

369
00:22:27,863 --> 00:22:28,698
Why so surprised?

370
00:22:34,747 --> 00:22:36,266
Why are you so shocked? I’m just single.

371
00:22:36,266 --> 00:22:37,263
Of course, I’m shocked.

372
00:22:37,588 --> 00:22:39,805
You had a fight with your girlfriend
and crashed at my place yesterday,

373
00:22:40,284 --> 00:22:42,588
and today you’re proudly saying
you’re single.

374
00:22:43,794 --> 00:22:44,887
We broke up this morning.

375
00:22:45,595 --> 00:22:46,544
Here we go again.

376
00:22:47,003 --> 00:22:49,497
This time, what shit did you do?

377
00:22:49,497 --> 00:22:50,205
Come on.

378
00:22:50,492 --> 00:22:53,786
Don’t you guys ever think
I’m the one who got done dirty?

379
00:22:53,901 --> 00:22:54,799
- No!
- No!

380
00:22:57,173 --> 00:22:58,804
Fine. I’ll admit it.

381
00:22:59,053 --> 00:22:59,775
I broke up with her.

382
00:23:02,091 --> 00:23:02,935
I knew it.

383
00:23:03,031 --> 00:23:04,332
She was unbearable.

384
00:23:04,753 --> 00:23:06,882
Always asking me for this,
asking me for that.

385
00:23:07,265 --> 00:23:08,140
It’s annoying.

386
00:23:08,331 --> 00:23:10,239
So I ended it. We just weren’t compatible.

387
00:23:10,564 --> 00:23:11,368
It’s over.

388
00:23:11,368 --> 00:23:12,645
So it’s not like…

389
00:23:14,598 --> 00:23:15,873
you’ve already got your eye
on someone else, right?

390
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:21,618
Well, I kinda…

391
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:22,591
started talking to someone.

392
00:23:22,591 --> 00:23:23,091
Just a little.

393
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:24,212
When we were fighting.

394
00:23:24,404 --> 00:23:27,241
Ouch! I’m sorry! I won’t do it again.

395
00:23:28,102 --> 00:23:29,362
This is so you.

396
00:23:29,764 --> 00:23:31,429
Don’t yell at me.

397
00:23:31,697 --> 00:23:34,703
Your friend here is heartbroken.

398
00:23:38,092 --> 00:23:40,257
It’s Saturday tomorrow.

399
00:23:40,582 --> 00:23:41,737
Go out of town with me.

400
00:23:42,656 --> 00:23:44,129
Take me on a break from love, please.

401
00:23:44,129 --> 00:23:45,407
Please, please.

402
00:23:45,407 --> 00:23:47,457
No. I’ve got plans with my mom.

403
00:23:47,821 --> 00:23:48,523
Bullshit.

404
00:23:48,772 --> 00:23:50,317
Mom or who, exactly?

405
00:23:50,317 --> 00:23:51,447
It’s really my mom.

406
00:23:51,619 --> 00:23:52,627
We’re doing a merit-making for my birthday.

407
00:23:53,699 --> 00:23:55,126
It’s your birthday this Saturday?

408
00:23:55,432 --> 00:23:57,039
Which means it’s J’s birthday too.

409
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:57,960
Right?

410
00:24:00,927 --> 00:24:01,613
Sure.

411
00:24:05,748 --> 00:24:07,312
Hi, hi, guys.

412
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,703
Mai, I thought you were dead.

413
00:24:09,703 --> 00:24:10,990
Why didn’t you come to class?

414
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,644
I wasn’t dead.

415
00:24:12,721 --> 00:24:14,304
Just not waking up.

416
00:24:14,495 --> 00:24:16,440
For two days straight?

417
00:24:20,307 --> 00:24:21,515
I’ve set my goal.

418
00:24:22,013 --> 00:24:22,651
Which is?

419
00:24:22,651 --> 00:24:25,856
I won’t skip class anymore.
I’m done being a burden to my friends.

420
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,366
If I fail to do so, then—

421
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:31,517
Lucky me, I won’t have to help you
scrape through like in high school.

422
00:24:32,206 --> 00:24:34,965
And I’m grateful
you didn’t enroll in Fashion like me.

423
00:24:35,998 --> 00:24:37,343
Don’t worry, hons.

424
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:38,769
Even though we’re in different faculties,

425
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:40,675
I can still be your burden.

426
00:24:42,226 --> 00:24:43,488
From now on,

427
00:24:43,584 --> 00:24:46,833
I swear I won’t skip class again.

428
00:24:47,101 --> 00:24:48,234
Starting tomorrow.

429
00:24:48,234 --> 00:24:49,224
Tomorrow’s Saturday.

430
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,268
Damn it.

431
00:24:52,364 --> 00:24:54,052
No more education.
You totally ruined my motivation.

432
00:24:55,469 --> 00:24:56,413
And he just took off.

433
00:24:58,653 --> 00:24:59,391
I’m outta here.

434
00:24:59,391 --> 00:25:00,413
- Sure.
- Sure.

435
00:25:00,949 --> 00:25:01,758
I’m really going.

436
00:25:01,758 --> 00:25:02,790
- Yes.
- Yes.

437
00:25:03,709 --> 00:25:04,800
I’m seriously leaving.

438
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,519
- Yes!
- Ye!

439
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:08,063
Hey, why aren’t you stopping me?

440
00:25:08,637 --> 00:25:09,534
Are we really friends?

441
00:25:09,534 --> 00:25:10,193
I’ll see you later, dude.

442
00:25:10,423 --> 00:25:11,266
Fine, see you.

443
00:25:11,266 --> 00:25:12,021
Hey, wait.

444
00:25:12,021 --> 00:25:13,842
Hey, man, come back.

445
00:25:14,627 --> 00:25:16,038
Don’t be sad.

446
00:25:16,038 --> 00:25:18,105
Long time no see. Come sit with us.

447
00:25:18,469 --> 00:25:19,647
Come on.

448
00:25:21,619 --> 00:25:22,503
Sit down.

449
00:25:25,604 --> 00:25:26,687
I feel bad for you.

450
00:25:26,687 --> 00:25:28,340
Don’t feel bad if you enjoyed it.

451
00:25:29,316 --> 00:25:30,410
Stop laughing.

452
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,341
I’m not laughing.

453
00:25:31,341 --> 00:25:33,287
Mai, are you okay, man?

454
00:25:33,287 --> 00:25:34,349
I’m sulking.

455
00:25:34,962 --> 00:25:35,598
Mai.

456
00:25:35,598 --> 00:25:36,331
Still sulking.

457
00:25:37,231 --> 00:25:37,900
You came running here.

458
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:38,992
Was there anything you wanna share?

459
00:25:39,681 --> 00:25:41,665
Ah! I almost forgot.

460
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,340
Tar, our senior,
just opened a new racing circuit.

461
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,982
Wanted to see if you guys
want to give it a test run.

462
00:25:47,097 --> 00:25:47,815
I’m in.

463
00:25:48,274 --> 00:25:48,963
Great.

464
00:25:49,422 --> 00:25:51,582
But some kid around here might not.

465
00:25:51,984 --> 00:25:55,112
He’s gotta sing
“Happy Birthday” with his mommy.

466
00:25:57,926 --> 00:25:59,176
Just tell me the time.

467
00:25:59,501 --> 00:26:00,354
Same time as usual?

468
00:26:00,354 --> 00:26:01,202
No problem.

469
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:07,336
Good. I’m pretty bored these days.

470
00:26:08,542 --> 00:26:10,051
Need an errand boy to keep me entertained.

471
00:26:13,629 --> 00:26:15,312
What excuse are you gonna use
to skip your birthday merit?

472
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:17,031
I’ve got a plan, alright.

473
00:26:17,222 --> 00:26:18,914
Don’t let yourself get hurt again, okay?

474
00:26:18,914 --> 00:26:19,566
I care about you.

475
00:26:20,236 --> 00:26:20,904
You do?

476
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:40,707
Hey.

477
00:26:41,597 --> 00:26:42,922
What mischievous thing are you doing now?

478
00:26:46,983 --> 00:26:48,505
Calm down, ma’am.

479
00:26:48,709 --> 00:26:51,840
I was driving earlier and heard a weird noise.

480
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,112
So, I’m just checking it.

481
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,532
Is that so?

482
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,781
It needs a tune-up from time to time.

483
00:26:57,781 --> 00:26:58,950
I use it every day, after all.

484
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:01,924
If I hear you boys are racing again…

485
00:27:02,035 --> 00:27:03,349
Who’d dare, ma’am?

486
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:05,794
And don’t think I don’t know
you got the car remapped.

487
00:27:05,794 --> 00:27:09,227
Do you really need
that kind of speed in Bangkok, hm?

488
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,921
You know car terms now.

489
00:27:11,317 --> 00:27:12,508
What a smart lady you are.

490
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:13,563
Don’t change the subject.

491
00:27:13,563 --> 00:27:15,349
All done.

492
00:27:15,349 --> 00:27:16,761
I’m hungry now.

493
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:19,564
Can you make me an omelet, please?

494
00:27:19,564 --> 00:27:21,936
Jeez, stay away from me!

495
00:27:22,604 --> 00:27:24,293
I can’t let my mom find out.

496
00:27:24,794 --> 00:27:28,615
Tell Tar he can’t post
any photos on his Page.

497
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:29,356
Okay.

498
00:27:29,745 --> 00:27:31,871
I’ll tell Mai to double-check with Tar.

499
00:27:32,947 --> 00:27:35,769
But what excuse are you gonna use
to skip your birthday merit?

500
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,185
I’ve got a plan, alright.

501
00:27:38,463 --> 00:27:39,183
What about you?

502
00:27:39,628 --> 00:27:40,507
Where are you crashing tonight?

503
00:27:41,317 --> 00:27:43,030
Going home or crashing at Farm’s?

504
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:44,169
Crashing at Farm’s.

505
00:27:44,484 --> 00:27:46,660
He took me to pack up my stuff
at my ex’s.

506
00:27:49,335 --> 00:27:49,835
Shit.

507
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:50,474
I gotta go, Jinn.

508
00:27:51,068 --> 00:27:51,708
Hey!

509
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:57,020
Take it and go to hell.

510
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,058
Don’t throw it. I’ll come up and get it myself.

511
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:03,625
Ouch!

512
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:04,744
Van!

513
00:28:06,153 --> 00:28:07,131
Are you okay?

514
00:28:08,157 --> 00:28:08,815
Damn it.

515
00:28:08,815 --> 00:28:10,040
You always get into this kind of problem.

516
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,065
I’m hurt again.

517
00:28:18,407 --> 00:28:19,179
Why so serious?

518
00:28:19,550 --> 00:28:20,587
It’s not like I’m dying.

519
00:28:21,588 --> 00:28:22,678
I’m afraid it’ll sting.

520
00:28:23,346 --> 00:28:24,870
I usually get slapped
and end up with split lips.

521
00:28:25,389 --> 00:28:26,891
This time it’s just a cut on the head.

522
00:28:27,243 --> 00:28:28,199
No big deal, my friend.

523
00:28:28,551 --> 00:28:30,240
Don’t let yourself get hurt again, okay?

524
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,205
I don’t like it.

525
00:28:32,058 --> 00:28:32,756
What’s wrong?

526
00:28:33,405 --> 00:28:34,219
I care about you.

527
00:28:38,002 --> 00:28:38,748
You do?

528
00:28:41,752 --> 00:28:43,389
I care about all of my friends.

529
00:28:43,463 --> 00:28:45,737
Who in their right mind
would want to see their friend injured?

530
00:28:45,737 --> 00:28:46,854
Mm.

531
00:28:46,947 --> 00:28:47,544
Okay.

532
00:28:48,323 --> 00:28:49,137
Lean over.

533
00:28:49,675 --> 00:28:50,605
Be gentle, alright?

534
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:51,337
Yeah.

535
00:28:51,448 --> 00:28:52,666
You’re making me scared.

536
00:28:56,523 --> 00:28:57,023
Ow.

537
00:28:57,023 --> 00:28:58,492
What? Does it hurt?

538
00:28:58,492 --> 00:28:59,407
No, I’m just kidding.

539
00:28:59,852 --> 00:29:00,789
You jerk.

540
00:29:01,317 --> 00:29:02,038
Ouch.

541
00:29:02,038 --> 00:29:02,820
Van.

542
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,802
It really hurts this time.

543
00:29:05,471 --> 00:29:05,971
Done.

544
00:29:10,793 --> 00:29:11,832
So, what now?

545
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,110
You don’t have
your girlfriend’s place to crash anymore.

546
00:29:16,131 --> 00:29:17,148
Well…

547
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,763
I guess I’ll look for a condo nearby.

548
00:29:21,505 --> 00:29:22,437
Don’t feel like going home.

549
00:29:22,622 --> 00:29:23,706
It’s a long drive.

550
00:29:25,709 --> 00:29:27,142
If you don’t mind…

551
00:29:28,663 --> 00:29:30,287
you can crash at my place.

552
00:29:30,714 --> 00:29:32,315
I don’t even know what ‘mind’ means.

553
00:29:32,816 --> 00:29:35,001
So yeah, I’ll share your room, my friend.

554
00:29:35,001 --> 00:29:35,666
Deal.

555
00:29:36,612 --> 00:29:37,327
I’m going to bed.

556
00:29:38,755 --> 00:29:40,163
Jeez, Van.

557
00:29:40,608 --> 00:29:42,051
You want another cut or what?

558
00:29:42,719 --> 00:29:43,877
You can take the couch.

559
00:29:44,971 --> 00:29:46,544
Is this my room or yours?

560
00:30:00,096 --> 00:30:00,781
Shit.

561
00:30:13,497 --> 00:30:14,742
Is it that bad?

562
00:30:14,909 --> 00:30:16,055
Bad?

563
00:30:16,927 --> 00:30:18,295
I didn’t even realize.

564
00:30:18,425 --> 00:30:20,563
I think I should take you to the hospital.

565
00:30:20,563 --> 00:30:22,653
It’s okay. I already went.

566
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,510
What did the doctor say?

567
00:30:26,317 --> 00:30:27,799
Well…

568
00:30:28,819 --> 00:30:29,974
I’ve got a fever.

569
00:30:31,465 --> 00:30:33,772
Some kind of virus, Mom.

570
00:30:34,514 --> 00:30:35,702
They gave me medicine.

571
00:30:36,317 --> 00:30:37,900
Don’t worry, Mom.

572
00:30:39,696 --> 00:30:41,746
But you were perfectly fine the other day.

573
00:30:41,746 --> 00:30:43,093
I’ll get better soon.

574
00:30:43,631 --> 00:30:47,571
Let’s go to the temple another time.

575
00:30:48,183 --> 00:30:50,156
I’m sorry I can’t go as planned, Mom.

576
00:30:50,156 --> 00:30:51,455
That’s alright.

577
00:30:52,011 --> 00:30:53,563
Take care of yourself.

578
00:30:53,656 --> 00:30:54,669
Get well soon.

579
00:30:56,004 --> 00:30:57,816
You’re my only child.

580
00:30:58,261 --> 00:30:59,421
Yes, Mom.

581
00:31:03,955 --> 00:31:05,353
I’m coming for you…

582
00:31:08,172 --> 00:31:09,145
J!

583
00:32:14,726 --> 00:32:15,659
What the hell was that?

584
00:32:54,322 --> 00:32:55,478
There’s no point checking it.

585
00:32:57,407 --> 00:32:59,335
It all comes down to skill.

586
00:33:04,546 --> 00:33:05,369
J, you asshole.

587
00:33:05,554 --> 00:33:07,425
Would it kill you
to leave me in peace for once?

588
00:33:09,428 --> 00:33:10,156
Hm?

589
00:33:10,953 --> 00:33:13,164
You guys always bring a war with you
whenever you come see me.

590
00:33:16,317 --> 00:33:16,899
- Tar.
- Tar.

591
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:25,242
What an honor to have you two race
the opening run on my track.

592
00:33:36,317 --> 00:33:37,722
Gosh, you’re already giving me a headache.

593
00:33:37,926 --> 00:33:39,803
How long have you two
been fighting, anyway?

594
00:33:40,025 --> 00:33:41,880
Wow, like forever, bro.

595
00:33:45,756 --> 00:33:49,395
So, what’s the bet this time?

596
00:33:49,618 --> 00:33:50,509
Will it be fun?

597
00:33:51,418 --> 00:33:52,244
Can I join?

598
00:33:52,522 --> 00:33:54,055
Is it ever not fun?

599
00:33:55,724 --> 00:33:58,411
Tar, will you excuse me?

600
00:33:58,634 --> 00:34:00,340
When your track’s ready,
just have someone come get me.

601
00:34:00,544 --> 00:34:01,607
I can’t stand his stinking face.

602
00:34:05,093 --> 00:34:06,182
Careful when you walk.

603
00:34:06,831 --> 00:34:07,639
Don’t trip.

604
00:34:09,438 --> 00:34:11,487
Don’t lose your strength
before you hit the accelerator.

605
00:34:16,550 --> 00:34:18,713
Are you two ever going to get along?

606
00:34:20,938 --> 00:34:21,755
Maybe.

607
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:27,631
If Jinn gets on his knees and begs me.

608
00:34:34,021 --> 00:34:36,694
- Ouch.
- Ow.

609
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:37,903
You are classmates.

610
00:34:37,903 --> 00:34:39,274
Why do you have to fight every single day?

611
00:34:39,608 --> 00:34:41,689
I’m so sick of you two.

612
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:52,211
Ouch.

613
00:34:53,287 --> 00:34:55,526
I’ll never be friends with you.

614
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:00,878
Hi, bro.

615
00:35:01,317 --> 00:35:02,669
We’re here.

616
00:35:04,412 --> 00:35:06,015
I thought you two wouldn’t come.

617
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:10,562
Whose foot did that to your head?

618
00:35:10,729 --> 00:35:13,108
Yeah, someone like him always gets that.

619
00:35:14,258 --> 00:35:18,690
Can’t you go through
one breakup without getting hurt?

620
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:19,828
It’s not like I wanted this.

621
00:35:20,236 --> 00:35:21,703
Who’d want to get hurt?

622
00:35:22,408 --> 00:35:24,339
You bothered Farm
to patch you up again, didn’t you?

623
00:35:24,784 --> 00:35:26,658
I also gave him one more headache.

624
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:29,112
I just moved into his condo.

625
00:35:30,373 --> 00:35:31,370
What’s going on here?

626
00:35:31,815 --> 00:35:33,417
You guys are oddly inseparable.

627
00:35:34,826 --> 00:35:37,626
Haven’t we always been inseparable?

628
00:35:37,756 --> 00:35:38,659
Van!

629
00:35:40,532 --> 00:35:41,716
Are you about to race?

630
00:35:41,901 --> 00:35:42,994
I’m getting excited already.

631
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,391
They’re still clearing the track.

632
00:35:44,391 --> 00:35:45,245
Should be done soon.

633
00:35:45,245 --> 00:35:46,818
Alright. Be good.

634
00:35:46,818 --> 00:35:49,138
Safety first. Don’t do anything stupid again.

635
00:35:49,138 --> 00:35:50,154
I know.

636
00:35:50,896 --> 00:35:51,887
Where’s J anyways?

637
00:35:55,541 --> 00:35:57,811
Hey, lack of sleep?

638
00:35:58,107 --> 00:36:00,378
If your health isn’t fit for it,
I’m not letting you race.

639
00:36:00,916 --> 00:36:01,861
It’s not that, bro.

640
00:36:02,454 --> 00:36:04,101
I just haven’t had a proper night’s sleep.

641
00:36:04,991 --> 00:36:05,611
What’s the matter?

642
00:36:17,268 --> 00:36:18,050
Tar…

643
00:36:19,237 --> 00:36:21,319
have you ever dreamed about
the same person over and over?

644
00:36:24,546 --> 00:36:26,123
Over and over?

645
00:36:29,591 --> 00:36:31,098
About the same person,

646
00:36:32,285 --> 00:36:33,672
but in different situations.

647
00:36:34,015 --> 00:36:35,180
What kind of situations?

648
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,563
Just ordinary, everyday stuff.

649
00:36:39,008 --> 00:36:40,951
Sometimes it’s just
a quick flash in my dream,

650
00:36:41,192 --> 00:36:43,362
sometimes it lasts longer,

651
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:47,413
and sometimes it’s just them
going through their daily routine.

652
00:36:50,436 --> 00:36:52,047
And who is it you keep dreaming about?

653
00:37:14,188 --> 00:37:15,417
Your boy’s here.

654
00:37:16,048 --> 00:37:16,783
Beam.

655
00:37:18,434 --> 00:37:19,724
Who do you think is gonna win?

656
00:37:33,573 --> 00:37:34,281
J!

657
00:37:35,898 --> 00:37:36,398
Hey!

658
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:37,429
Are you alright?

659
00:37:38,573 --> 00:37:39,590
I kept calling you.

660
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,385
Your boy’s here to see you.

661
00:37:42,171 --> 00:37:42,740
Hi, Beam.

662
00:37:43,995 --> 00:37:45,837
I thought I wouldn’t make it in time.

663
00:37:46,018 --> 00:37:47,431
Lucky me, I finished my errands early.

664
00:37:50,394 --> 00:37:51,503
Can I get a hug?

665
00:37:52,017 --> 00:37:53,165
You know, for emotional support?

666
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,382
Of course.

667
00:38:00,799 --> 00:38:03,262
Why would you even
join a race like this against Jinn?

668
00:38:03,474 --> 00:38:05,038
It’s dangerous. I’m worried.

669
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,424
Don’t worry, Beam.

670
00:38:06,726 --> 00:38:08,451
You can pick wherever you want to eat.

671
00:38:08,451 --> 00:38:11,053
After I win, we’ll celebrate.

672
00:38:13,573 --> 00:38:15,387
Sure. Be safe, okay?

673
00:38:17,669 --> 00:38:19,577
Farm, look after him for me.

674
00:38:19,804 --> 00:38:20,304
Mm.

675
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:22,891
You two done snuggling up?

676
00:38:23,012 --> 00:38:25,587
If not, I’ll go take a nap upstairs while I wait.

677
00:38:35,005 --> 00:38:36,304
Cone on, dude.

678
00:38:37,206 --> 00:38:39,245
Farm, let’s go watch from the box upstairs.

679
00:38:40,076 --> 00:38:40,889
Let’s go.

680
00:38:41,826 --> 00:38:43,425
Please, please.

681
00:38:50,868 --> 00:38:51,961
Who do you think’s gonna win?

682
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,095
Can I choose not to guess?

683
00:38:54,685 --> 00:38:56,678
I just hope they make it out safe and sound.

684
00:38:57,524 --> 00:38:59,403
- Sadhu, your holiness.
- Sadhu, your holiness.

685
00:39:00,824 --> 00:39:02,906
I’m betting on J this time.

686
00:39:06,488 --> 00:39:07,228
Why?

687
00:39:07,364 --> 00:39:10,227
He’s got strong support here.

688
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,958
He can’t lose face, can he?

689
00:39:13,109 --> 00:39:14,964
I’ll go for Jinn, then.

690
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:15,816
Why’s that?

691
00:39:15,816 --> 00:39:19,588
Maybe the fire in his heart will light up
the engine and make it go faster.

692
00:39:20,434 --> 00:39:21,817
That’s just the dumbest reason.

693
00:39:22,603 --> 00:39:24,053
How many laps, Tar?

694
00:39:24,386 --> 00:39:26,442
Jinn asked for three laps.

695
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:28,508
Said after that, he’ll send J straight
to the crematorium and let him burn.

696
00:39:28,573 --> 00:39:29,470
Wow!

697
00:39:29,727 --> 00:39:32,693
Those two can turn
any sentence into a war of words.

698
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:34,883
When will they ever stop competing?

699
00:40:01,818 --> 00:40:02,518
Damn.

700
00:40:02,518 --> 00:40:04,218
That’s about the same start speed.

701
00:40:18,317 --> 00:40:19,642
Hey, look. Jinn’s taking the lead!

702
00:40:34,542 --> 00:40:35,419
Keep on dreaming.

703
00:40:41,445 --> 00:40:42,793
I didn’t know their cars were this fast.

704
00:40:42,944 --> 00:40:44,231
They got their cars modified.

705
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:46,309
Damn.

706
00:40:46,566 --> 00:40:48,154
They really don’t care about their lives.

707
00:40:50,402 --> 00:40:52,376
If I’d known, I never would’ve let them race.

708
00:40:57,550 --> 00:40:58,154
Damn it!

709
00:40:58,366 --> 00:41:00,201
Hey, J’s taking the lead now!

710
00:41:10,457 --> 00:41:11,409
J, you bastard.

711
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:41,690
What the hell is wrong with him?

712
00:41:43,307 --> 00:41:44,940
Hey, what’s happening to J?

713
00:41:45,227 --> 00:41:46,114
J, be safe.

714
00:41:58,001 --> 00:41:59,121
Shit. What the heck?

715
00:42:01,949 --> 00:42:02,458
Hey.

716
00:42:03,573 --> 00:42:04,464
What are you looking at?

717
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:11,658
Shit!

718
00:42:12,228 --> 00:42:12,757
No!

719
00:42:17,927 --> 00:42:18,573
J!

720
00:42:20,145 --> 00:42:20,721
J!

721
00:42:22,263 --> 00:42:23,487
Damn it, J. Can you hear me?

722
00:42:37,447 --> 00:42:38,100
J!

723
00:42:40,639 --> 00:42:42,052
Do you hear me? Unlock the car.

724
00:42:44,397 --> 00:42:46,725
Jackass! Answer me!

725
00:42:46,725 --> 00:42:47,769
Open your damn eyes.

726
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,603
You boys must live together.

727
00:43:15,603 --> 00:43:16,450
Eat together.

728
00:43:17,402 --> 00:43:18,544
Sleep together.

729
00:43:19,753 --> 00:43:24,019
Until J is fully recovered.

730
00:43:24,865 --> 00:43:27,303
At least you guys get to live
and spend time together.

731
00:43:27,742 --> 00:43:29,895
Who knows — sparks might fly.

732
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,395
Don’t get too close to me.

733
00:43:33,286 --> 00:43:34,680
Or you will fall in love.

734
00:43:36,494 --> 00:43:37,936
Why is it always you

735
00:43:38,573 --> 00:43:39,859
in every single dream?
