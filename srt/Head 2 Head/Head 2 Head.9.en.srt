4

Jinn, don’t go.

5
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:17,695
Did you have a bad dream, son?

6
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:18,439
Huh?

7
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:19,985
I just want to hug you tight.

8
00:00:19,985 --> 00:00:20,790
Is it too tight?

9
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:23,492
It feels like getting wrapped by a snake.

10
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:25,348
Well, I love you.

11
00:00:26,524 --> 00:00:28,842
You took my notebook
and forbade me from looking.

12
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:30,088
You didn’t look, did you?

13
00:00:30,088 --> 00:00:32,005
Why? Is there a secret?

14
00:00:32,005 --> 00:00:33,667
I just wrote my love confession.

15
00:00:34,146 --> 00:00:38,413
So when you open it, you’ll blush.

16
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:41,613
Every time you can’t sleep,
you become my burden.

17
00:00:41,613 --> 00:00:43,900
Are you sure I’m the one who can’t sleep?

18
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,456
I don’t like it when Mom talks about him.

19
00:00:45,456 --> 00:00:46,808
What if he regrets it?

20
00:00:46,808 --> 00:00:48,123
Would you give him a chance?

21
00:00:48,254 --> 00:00:49,832
You sound like you know something.

22
00:00:50,529 --> 00:00:51,366
No.

23
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,781
Farm, don’t do this.

24
00:00:53,781 --> 00:00:54,704
I’m serious.

25
00:00:54,987 --> 00:00:56,345
If we break up now,

26
00:00:56,497 --> 00:00:58,094
we could still go back to being friends.

27
00:00:58,094 --> 00:00:58,829
I’m not breaking up.

28
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:02,848
(Don’t look for me.
I’ll live my life somewhere.)

29
00:01:02,848 --> 00:01:04,805
(One day, I’ll come back. — Jinn)

30
00:01:04,805 --> 00:01:06,366
That means in two years,

31
00:01:06,453 --> 00:01:08,955
Auntie Jan will die and you will disappear?

32
00:01:09,347 --> 00:01:10,915
I will change everything.

33
00:01:11,024 --> 00:01:12,029
I promise.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,424
Come back already, Jinn.

35
00:01:27,628 --> 00:01:32,097
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

36
00:01:32,097 --> 00:01:35,867
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

37
00:01:36,107 --> 00:01:39,223
♪ Happy birthday, happy birthday ♪

38
00:01:39,441 --> 00:01:42,875
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

39
00:01:44,508 --> 00:01:46,096
Happy birthday, son.

40
00:01:46,684 --> 00:01:48,090
Make a wish, my dear.

41
00:01:56,099 --> 00:01:57,446
(I wish you were back.)

42
00:02:00,712 --> 00:02:02,130
What the heck are you wishing for?

43
00:02:02,217 --> 00:02:03,674
You’re taking forever.

44
00:02:10,462 --> 00:02:11,183
Jinn.

45
00:02:12,794 --> 00:02:13,750
Yes, it’s me.

46
00:02:14,294 --> 00:02:15,667
You look like you just saw a ghost.

47
00:02:17,844 --> 00:02:19,061
Make a wish, my dear.

48
00:02:19,061 --> 00:02:20,559
(You look like you just saw a ghost.)

49
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:31,082
Another bad dream?

50
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:34,025
No.

51
00:02:35,135 --> 00:02:37,049
I was just waking up.

52
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:40,439
I’ll be fine.

53
00:02:47,156 --> 00:02:48,775
And I won’t let anything happen to you.

54
00:04:52,652 --> 00:04:54,550
Two years after Auntie Jan’s death…

55
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:58,250
(Don’t look for me.
I’ll live my life somewhere.)

56
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:01,299
(One day, I’ll come back. — Jinn)

57
00:05:03,193 --> 00:05:05,032
You’ll disappear for seven years.

58
00:05:06,186 --> 00:05:07,992
We’ll meet again when we’re 30.

59
00:05:18,922 --> 00:05:21,082
I should’ve died and gotten it over with.

60
00:05:22,629 --> 00:05:26,524
Instead of coming back to be your burden.

61
00:05:27,938 --> 00:05:28,663
Mom!

62
00:05:29,012 --> 00:05:30,054
I’m not a tree!

63
00:05:35,653 --> 00:05:36,857
Hey, Mom!

64
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:38,808
- Get some water!
- Ow, Mom!

65
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,578
Maybe it’ll help you grow.

66
00:05:41,578 --> 00:05:43,730
Here, have some water.

67
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,460
Fine. You want to play?

68
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,104
What?

69
00:05:47,084 --> 00:05:49,203
No! You’re soaked.

70
00:05:51,897 --> 00:05:53,254
What the hell are you staring at?

71
00:05:53,842 --> 00:05:54,466
Ouch!

72
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,737
That hurt, Mom.

73
00:05:55,737 --> 00:05:57,588
Don’t talk to your friend like that.

74
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,511
Did your mom cook today?

75
00:06:02,511 --> 00:06:03,840
Why don’t you come eat at our place?

76
00:06:08,238 --> 00:06:10,707
Nina, move a little closer to Van.

77
00:06:12,558 --> 00:06:14,375
You didn’t tell me you were
modeling for your own project too.

78
00:06:16,748 --> 00:06:19,040
I’m saving the budget, Van.

79
00:06:19,301 --> 00:06:20,157
Saving the budget?

80
00:06:20,418 --> 00:06:22,033
You don’t even have to pay me.

81
00:06:23,165 --> 00:06:27,103
Did you bring it up just so I’d say,

82
00:06:27,234 --> 00:06:28,879
“Because you’re a model,

83
00:06:29,358 --> 00:06:31,321
I want to model with you”?

84
00:06:32,018 --> 00:06:33,826
That sounds more honest
than the first answer.

85
00:06:35,655 --> 00:06:37,398
Ready, guys?

86
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,472
Okay.

87
00:06:39,212 --> 00:06:40,950
Three, two, one.

88
00:06:43,171 --> 00:06:44,212
One more.

89
00:06:45,736 --> 00:06:46,652
Ready?

90
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:49,838
Okay, we’ve got it.

91
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:02,138
Thank you, Van, for helping with my project.

92
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,316
It’s nothing at all.

93
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,556
If you need more help, just let me know.

94
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:06,530
Are we done here?

95
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:08,026
We can leave now, right?

96
00:07:09,224 --> 00:07:10,619
We’re off then.

97
00:07:11,185 --> 00:07:13,791
If I’d known you’d have to wait this long,

98
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,471
I would’ve asked you to model too, Farm.

99
00:07:17,799 --> 00:07:19,475
He was just waiting to pick me up.

100
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:21,672
Farm doesn’t really like things like this.

101
00:07:22,586 --> 00:07:25,265
You have such a great friend, Van.

102
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:28,720
Sorry again, Farm.

103
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,524
We took longer than expected.

104
00:07:30,524 --> 00:07:33,375
You must’ve waited a long time.

105
00:07:35,444 --> 00:07:37,862
Alright, we’ll get going now.

106
00:07:41,433 --> 00:07:43,318
I told you I could get myself home.

107
00:07:43,732 --> 00:07:44,699
Bored as hell, huh?

108
00:07:45,178 --> 00:07:46,447
You’re my boyfriend.

109
00:07:46,621 --> 00:07:48,067
It’s normal for me to take care of you.

110
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:52,578
Are you hungry?

111
00:07:52,709 --> 00:07:53,911
Want to grab something on the way home?

112
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:56,842
Your call.

113
00:07:58,497 --> 00:07:59,306
No.

114
00:07:59,676 --> 00:08:01,093
What do you want to eat?

115
00:08:01,354 --> 00:08:02,022
Anything.

116
00:08:06,246 --> 00:08:08,930
How about the food I make?

117
00:08:10,019 --> 00:08:11,037
You will cook?

118
00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:12,531
Mm.

119
00:08:14,513 --> 00:08:16,364
Ow, ow, ow.

120
00:08:17,126 --> 00:08:19,535
This stupid oil is splashing everywhere.

121
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,532
We can just order food.

122
00:08:22,229 --> 00:08:24,531
No. I want to cook for you.

123
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:27,932
The oil’s splashing

124
00:08:28,063 --> 00:08:29,583
because the pan’s still wet.

125
00:08:29,844 --> 00:08:31,261
You need to dry it first.

126
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:32,356
That way, it won’t splash.

127
00:08:33,401 --> 00:08:36,517
And even if it does, it’ll stop in no time.

128
00:08:36,713 --> 00:08:37,975
Don’t whine.

129
00:08:38,367 --> 00:08:39,541
“In no time,” my ass.

130
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,614
It burns like hell.

131
00:08:43,486 --> 00:08:44,779
- Boo!
- Hey!

132
00:08:44,953 --> 00:08:46,231
What are you playing?

133
00:08:50,803 --> 00:08:51,603
Ouch.

134
00:08:52,017 --> 00:08:53,096
I’ll just stand here.

135
00:08:55,578 --> 00:08:57,548
A grown man scared of oil.

136
00:08:58,223 --> 00:09:00,189
Don’t they look great?

137
00:09:02,018 --> 00:09:03,388
I made all of these.

138
00:09:04,237 --> 00:09:05,826
But I helped a lot.

139
00:09:07,524 --> 00:09:09,870
The splashing oil ruined it for me.

140
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:12,551
Let’s eat. Stop whining.

141
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:29,948
Van.

142
00:09:30,405 --> 00:09:30,905
Hm?

143
00:09:32,516 --> 00:09:34,862
I don’t know how serious you are about us.

144
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,114
But I want it to work out.

145
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:43,022
Why so serious all of a sudden?

146
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:44,487
You’re scaring me.

147
00:09:46,991 --> 00:09:48,512
I just wanted you to know.

148
00:09:49,688 --> 00:09:53,330
You know, I’m really doing my best for us.

149
00:09:57,293 --> 00:09:58,584
Should we hit the gym after we eat?

150
00:09:58,584 --> 00:10:00,238
There you go again.

151
00:10:01,261 --> 00:10:04,256
Well, I don’t like serious stuff.

152
00:10:04,256 --> 00:10:07,089
Whenever we talk about serious things,
you get all grumpy.

153
00:10:08,091 --> 00:10:09,402
I’d rather see you smile.

154
00:10:14,366 --> 00:10:16,267
So you’re not scared of the gym anymore?

155
00:10:16,267 --> 00:10:17,092
I’m not scared…

156
00:10:19,226 --> 00:10:21,401
Okay, maybe a little.

157
00:10:22,403 --> 00:10:24,803
Be gentle with me, alright?

158
00:10:25,587 --> 00:10:26,578
Sure.

159
00:10:27,471 --> 00:10:28,149
You’ll find out.

160
00:10:31,506 --> 00:10:33,305
Yeah, I don’t trust you at all.

161
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,222
Aren’t you going to help?

162
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,390
You’re working to pay for this meal.

163
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,872
Then I’m sleeping over tonight.

164
00:10:48,656 --> 00:10:49,959
Why would I allow that?

165
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:51,751
As a reward for doing the dishes.

166
00:10:52,295 --> 00:10:53,104
Ah!

167
00:10:53,714 --> 00:10:56,943
If that cuts my forehead,
you’ll have to take care of me again.

168
00:10:57,052 --> 00:10:57,819
Don’t exaggerate.

169
00:10:57,819 --> 00:10:58,945
It’s just an apple.

170
00:11:01,471 --> 00:11:02,083
Hey!

171
00:11:02,518 --> 00:11:04,056
J, I’m eating.

172
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,594
You could’ve gotten it dirty.

173
00:11:06,422 --> 00:11:07,248
Gosh, it’s sour.

174
00:11:09,422 --> 00:11:10,101
Oh, by the way.

175
00:11:10,841 --> 00:11:11,846
About that.

176
00:11:12,434 --> 00:11:13,507
When are you going to tell?

177
00:11:19,734 --> 00:11:20,383
Well…

178
00:11:21,864 --> 00:11:22,867
How do you feel about it?

179
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:27,131
Honestly, I’m fine with anything.

180
00:11:31,573 --> 00:11:32,420
Why do you look so shocked?

181
00:11:35,643 --> 00:11:37,056
I didn’t think it’d be this easy.

182
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:41,508
Like I said, it’ll just be a little embarrassing.

183
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:42,177
What?

184
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:48,578
I think they already got a hint.

185
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:49,968
If we tell them now,

186
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,097
they shouldn’t be too surprised.

187
00:11:52,707 --> 00:11:53,434
What do you think?

188
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:57,210
Or should we not tell them
to avoid the embarrassment?

189
00:11:58,952 --> 00:11:59,590
Hold on.

190
00:12:00,962 --> 00:12:02,232
What are you talking about?

191
00:12:02,842 --> 00:12:03,496
About…

192
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:06,533
us dating.

193
00:12:10,931 --> 00:12:13,306
Oh! Right.

194
00:12:17,346 --> 00:12:19,384
What did you think I meant?

195
00:12:23,086 --> 00:12:25,798
The same thing.

196
00:12:25,972 --> 00:12:26,660
Forget it.

197
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:33,866
Hm?

198
00:12:36,442 --> 00:12:37,786
You’re acting suspicious.

199
00:12:40,036 --> 00:12:41,230
Why is this so sour?

200
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:44,598
Eight.

201
00:12:45,382 --> 00:12:46,790
- Nine.
- Nine.

202
00:12:48,532 --> 00:12:49,824
- Ten.
- Ten.

203
00:12:51,892 --> 00:12:52,494
Gosh.

204
00:12:59,244 --> 00:13:00,518
How about one more set?

205
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,974
Look at me. Do you really think I can?

206
00:13:12,762 --> 00:13:13,964
This is exhausting.

207
00:13:38,855 --> 00:13:40,910
I should’ve died and gotten it over with.

208
00:13:41,323 --> 00:13:45,660
Instead of coming back to be your burden.

209
00:13:51,126 --> 00:13:53,582
I never thought we’d have a day like this.

210
00:14:13,213 --> 00:14:13,734
Jinn.

211
00:14:14,278 --> 00:14:14,925
Hm?

212
00:14:16,144 --> 00:14:18,000
Hey, J.

213
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,916
It won’t stop.

214
00:14:21,177 --> 00:14:22,162
Are you okay?

215
00:14:23,643 --> 00:14:25,763
Sit down for now. Come here. Slowly.

216
00:14:28,876 --> 00:14:29,644
Let me see.

217
00:14:32,215 --> 00:14:33,702
Pinch your nose and tilt your head down.

218
00:14:33,702 --> 00:14:34,812
I’ll go get an ice pack.

219
00:14:35,139 --> 00:14:36,079
You don’t have a headache, right?

220
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,419
Everything feels normal?

221
00:14:37,593 --> 00:14:38,574
Okay. I’ll be right back.

222
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,909
You’re not like this because of me, are you?

223
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,833
You’re cute.

224
00:14:48,573 --> 00:14:52,215
You’re extra cute
when you’re worried about me.

225
00:14:52,846 --> 00:14:54,039
You’re my boyfriend.

226
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,596
Who else would I worry about, if not you?

227
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,406
Hey!

228
00:15:31,507 --> 00:15:32,263
I’ll put it on you now.

229
00:15:35,275 --> 00:15:36,396
It’s cold!

230
00:15:36,396 --> 00:15:39,520
Of course, jerk. It’s ice.

231
00:15:40,332 --> 00:15:41,375
Are you okay, though?

232
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:42,911
Any other symptoms?

233
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:49,368
It says here if it’s still bleeding
after twenty to thirty minutes,

234
00:15:49,368 --> 00:15:50,543
you need to see a doctor.

235
00:15:50,543 --> 00:15:51,304
Shit!

236
00:15:51,304 --> 00:15:52,258
It’s been longer than that.

237
00:15:52,258 --> 00:15:52,939
Hey.

238
00:15:53,046 --> 00:15:54,571
Stay still, or you’ll bleed more.

239
00:15:54,592 --> 00:15:55,313
Hey!

240
00:15:55,335 --> 00:15:57,265
What? I said stay still. Oops!

241
00:15:58,354 --> 00:15:59,605
You numbed my eyes.

242
00:16:00,536 --> 00:16:01,146
Sorry.

243
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:05,108
Why are you sitting up?

244
00:16:05,706 --> 00:16:06,945
The nosebleed could come back.

245
00:16:07,543 --> 00:16:08,618
I’m okay now.

246
00:16:11,823 --> 00:16:13,226
That’s the second time this has happened.

247
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,125
Maybe it’s all the dust lately.

248
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:23,020
Is there something you’re not telling me?

249
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:28,191
Why the heck are you smiling?

250
00:16:31,567 --> 00:16:33,665
You’re cute.

251
00:16:33,665 --> 00:16:35,361
You idiot. This isn’t the time.

252
00:16:36,857 --> 00:16:38,551
You really are cute.

253
00:16:39,512 --> 00:16:40,242
Hey.

254
00:16:44,601 --> 00:16:46,376
You’re extra cute

255
00:16:46,974 --> 00:16:48,053
when you’re worried about me.

256
00:16:49,698 --> 00:16:50,302
J.

257
00:16:52,439 --> 00:16:53,074
Hm?

258
00:16:54,698 --> 00:16:56,501
You’re not like this because of me, are you?

259
00:17:03,228 --> 00:17:04,428
I’m like this because of you.

260
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,812
Your room is full of dust.

261
00:17:11,325 --> 00:17:12,290
You grubby guy.

262
00:17:15,239 --> 00:17:16,639
Grubby?

263
00:17:16,938 --> 00:17:18,441
- Grubby, huh?
- Hey, Jinn.

264
00:17:18,676 --> 00:17:20,446
- You’re sick, huh?
- I’m unwell here.

265
00:17:21,685 --> 00:17:22,471
Hey, hey.

266
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:24,458
J, let go. Let go.

267
00:17:29,847 --> 00:17:30,791
I love you.

268
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,135
What’s gotten into you?

269
00:17:34,716 --> 00:17:35,887
I just wanted to tell you that.

270
00:17:37,831 --> 00:17:38,923
Do you love me?

271
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:45,260
Tell me now. Do you love me?

272
00:17:50,454 --> 00:17:51,106
Do you?

273
00:17:53,264 --> 00:17:54,401
I’ve always loved you.

274
00:17:55,277 --> 00:17:56,349
Since we were seven.

275
00:17:57,332 --> 00:17:58,186
Are you happy now?

276
00:18:03,485 --> 00:18:04,354
I’m happy now.

277
00:18:06,149 --> 00:18:07,150
I’ll put the ice away.

278
00:18:21,214 --> 00:18:22,175
Good night.

279
00:18:23,756 --> 00:18:24,395
Mm.

280
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,829
I hope you sleep well.

281
00:18:46,692 --> 00:18:48,711
I should’ve died and gotten it over with.

282
00:18:51,489 --> 00:18:55,334
Instead of coming back to be your burden.

283
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:57,985
You were gone for seven years.

284
00:18:59,977 --> 00:19:02,110
Now you’re back and you’re going to
leave me again?

285
00:19:10,058 --> 00:19:12,218
I never thought we’d have a day like this.

286
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,718
I thought we’d hate each other until the end.

287
00:19:21,015 --> 00:19:22,716
Stay with me longer.

288
00:19:45,323 --> 00:19:45,979
Jinn.

289
00:19:47,774 --> 00:19:49,220
Please don’t leave me yet.

290
00:19:52,169 --> 00:19:53,672
I just got a chance to love you.

291
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,674
Not hating each other until the last day

292
00:19:57,892 --> 00:19:59,801
is good enough for me.

293
00:20:04,224 --> 00:20:05,971
I love you, Jerome.

294
00:20:07,937 --> 00:20:09,768
I just wanted to tell you that.

295
00:20:12,396 --> 00:20:13,684
I’ve always loved you.

296
00:20:16,248 --> 00:20:17,927
Since we were seven.

297
00:20:22,115 --> 00:20:23,053
I know.

298
00:20:25,788 --> 00:20:27,443
I may love you later,

299
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,070
but I will love only you forever.

300
00:21:33,574 --> 00:21:34,565
Where did this blood come from?

301
00:21:37,941 --> 00:21:40,985
J, there’s something on me
that looks like blood.

302
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,010
J.

303
00:21:49,174 --> 00:21:49,774
J.

304
00:21:51,015 --> 00:21:51,702
J.

305
00:21:52,576 --> 00:21:53,296
J!

306
00:21:54,131 --> 00:21:54,914
J!

307
00:21:55,085 --> 00:21:56,330
J, you asshole!

308
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:59,559
J, wake up. J!

309
00:22:00,627 --> 00:22:01,795
Can you hear me?

310
00:22:02,073 --> 00:22:02,716
J!

311
00:22:06,818 --> 00:22:08,159
But he had blood all over.

312
00:22:08,565 --> 00:22:10,200
On himself and on me.

313
00:22:10,756 --> 00:22:14,508
After a thorough examination,
everything appears normal.

314
00:22:15,015 --> 00:22:19,180
The nosebleed may
have been caused by dry weather.

315
00:22:19,372 --> 00:22:22,416
Sometimes, even a minor bump
to the nose can cause it.

316
00:22:22,416 --> 00:22:23,993
Based on my assessment,

317
00:22:24,185 --> 00:22:27,018
there are no wounds or signs of injury
we need to worry about.

318
00:22:28,364 --> 00:22:30,416
If he’s fine, then why isn’t he waking up?

319
00:22:31,207 --> 00:22:34,865
The patient is exhausted from lack of sleep,

320
00:22:34,865 --> 00:22:36,400
so I gave him medication to help him sleep,

321
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,570
allowing his body to fully rest.

322
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,800
There’s no need to worry.

323
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:43,608
If you don’t have further questions,
I’ll excuse myself.

324
00:22:45,381 --> 00:22:46,655
Of course. Thank you.

325
00:22:59,331 --> 00:23:03,491
Between you and me,
who should really be more afraid of death?

326
00:23:21,015 --> 00:23:24,606
Hey, J and Jinn skipped class again?

327
00:23:24,606 --> 00:23:26,041
The exam’s coming up.

328
00:23:27,793 --> 00:23:29,288
I just talked to Jinn on the phone.

329
00:23:29,288 --> 00:23:30,358
He said J is sick.

330
00:23:30,593 --> 00:23:32,814
I didn’t get a chance to ask more
before he hung up.

331
00:23:33,263 --> 00:23:35,085
And now I can’t reach either of them.

332
00:23:35,961 --> 00:23:37,780
Why are they sick so damn often?

333
00:23:38,421 --> 00:23:39,026
Right?

334
00:23:39,176 --> 00:23:40,880
They’re usually pretty healthy.

335
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,538
Wait.

336
00:23:41,923 --> 00:23:42,992
What if…

337
00:23:44,103 --> 00:23:49,038
Jinn’s secretly poisoning J, hoping he’ll die slowly?

338
00:23:49,444 --> 00:23:50,601
Oh, shit.

339
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:53,473
So when Jinn agreed to
let him stay at his place,

340
00:23:54,071 --> 00:23:57,074
it was actually a murder plan.

341
00:23:57,074 --> 00:23:57,863
Wild!

342
00:23:57,863 --> 00:23:58,821
Nonsense!

343
00:23:59,633 --> 00:24:01,344
Mai, you’ve been watching
too many dramas.

344
00:24:01,515 --> 00:24:04,482
Come on. I was just joking.

345
00:24:04,717 --> 00:24:06,693
Why are you so serious?

346
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,830
Look at that fierce face.

347
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:10,567
I’m terrified.

348
00:24:10,823 --> 00:24:13,660
Please help me. He’s so scary.

349
00:24:15,324 --> 00:24:16,084
Mai!

350
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:18,613
Let go of Van’s arm already.

351
00:24:19,703 --> 00:24:20,837
What’s the problem, sir?

352
00:24:21,307 --> 00:24:23,803
I’ve been clinging to him for years.

353
00:24:23,803 --> 00:24:25,405
Why are you acting possessive now?

354
00:24:25,747 --> 00:24:26,829
Watch this.

355
00:24:27,528 --> 00:24:29,409
- Here I go.
- Hey, Mai! It’s ticklish.

356
00:24:29,409 --> 00:24:30,482
How about the other cheek?

357
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:31,262
Enough.

358
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:32,646
Not enough. Come on.

359
00:24:32,646 --> 00:24:33,934
- Mai.
- Before this…

360
00:24:35,045 --> 00:24:36,220
he wasn’t in a relationship,

361
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,407
so you could cling to him.

362
00:24:38,347 --> 00:24:39,571
But now he’s my boyfriend.

363
00:24:39,571 --> 00:24:40,333
What?!

364
00:24:41,935 --> 00:24:43,022
You two…

365
00:24:44,368 --> 00:24:45,258
are together?

366
00:24:45,856 --> 00:24:46,463
Yes.

367
00:24:47,403 --> 00:24:48,143
Farm!

368
00:24:48,143 --> 00:24:50,259
Don’t joke like that.

369
00:24:53,821 --> 00:24:54,432
Ouch!

370
00:24:59,047 --> 00:24:59,672
Farm!

371
00:25:10,089 --> 00:25:11,606
Being just friends was already great.

372
00:25:15,628 --> 00:25:16,788
Hey, Farm.

373
00:25:17,664 --> 00:25:18,573
Hold on.

374
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,170
Get out and talk to me first.

375
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,228
We should talk this through.

376
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:23,480
Why are you running away?

377
00:25:26,187 --> 00:25:27,894
Hey, Farm! Wait!

378
00:25:28,171 --> 00:25:28,806
Farm!

379
00:25:29,062 --> 00:25:29,774
Farm!

380
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:45,019
My mom and your parents are at work.

381
00:25:47,049 --> 00:25:48,141
So I didn’t tell any of them.

382
00:25:48,697 --> 00:25:50,257
After the doc said you were okay,

383
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,532
I kind of let it slide.

384
00:25:51,895 --> 00:25:52,765
I didn’t want to worry them.

385
00:25:56,248 --> 00:25:57,450
Smart boy.

386
00:25:58,241 --> 00:25:59,172
What breed are you?

387
00:25:59,321 --> 00:26:00,216
I’m not a dog.

388
00:26:02,545 --> 00:26:04,027
Why are you moody now?

389
00:26:06,164 --> 00:26:06,828
Nothing.

390
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,168
Jinn.

391
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,811
I woke up and saw you covered in blood.

392
00:26:15,811 --> 00:26:16,685
I even had your blood on me.

393
00:26:16,685 --> 00:26:17,617
How could I not be shocked?

394
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,599
When I woke you up,
you were slurring and not making any sense.

395
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:22,278
We were lucky you could walk to the car
so we could get to the hospital.

396
00:26:22,278 --> 00:26:24,184
I almost called a rescue squad, you know?

397
00:26:26,555 --> 00:26:30,302
When I saw blood all over your face,
my heart dropped to the damn floor.

398
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,100
You were worried?

399
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:31,824
Hm?

400
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:32,955
“I’m worried.”

401
00:26:34,194 --> 00:26:35,515
That’s all you needed to say.

402
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:40,702
Yes! I’m worried.

403
00:26:42,817 --> 00:26:44,130
You’re my boyfriend.

404
00:26:45,015 --> 00:26:46,580
Who else would I worry about, if not you?

405
00:26:49,593 --> 00:26:51,865
There, there.

406
00:26:52,164 --> 00:26:54,407
Don’t be scared.

407
00:26:54,792 --> 00:26:56,201
Your boyfriend is right here.

408
00:26:57,184 --> 00:26:59,085
I’m not going anywhere.

409
00:27:05,409 --> 00:27:07,066
Please don’t get sick.

410
00:27:08,498 --> 00:27:09,831
Of course I won’t.

411
00:27:10,301 --> 00:27:12,823
The doctor said
everything was fine, didn’t he?

412
00:27:14,126 --> 00:27:19,163
I swear I’ll be here getting on your nerves
for a long, long time.

413
00:27:23,586 --> 00:27:24,832
Not the time to joke around.

414
00:27:26,221 --> 00:27:29,888
You have to stay with me for a long time too,
so I can get on your nerves. Got it?

415
00:27:35,144 --> 00:27:36,033
It’s funny.

416
00:27:37,443 --> 00:27:38,147
What is?

417
00:27:39,344 --> 00:27:40,320
You and me.

418
00:27:41,431 --> 00:27:44,106
Who would’ve thought
we’d have a day like this?

419
00:27:46,713 --> 00:27:48,818
I thought we’d hate each other until the end.

420
00:27:51,015 --> 00:27:53,303
(I never thought we’d have a day like this.)

421
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:55,878
Who would’ve thought
we’d have a day like this?

422
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,486
I thought we’d hate each other…

423
00:27:57,486 --> 00:27:58,618
- until the end.
- until the end.

424
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:04,414
Oh, gosh.

425
00:28:04,414 --> 00:28:05,789
Are you okay?

426
00:28:06,302 --> 00:28:07,639
I thought you were f*cking dead.

427
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:09,886
I’m very much alive.

428
00:28:10,527 --> 00:28:11,552
What a shame.

429
00:28:11,808 --> 00:28:14,635
You, f*cking dipshit.

430
00:28:16,686 --> 00:28:17,666
Go die, asshole.

431
00:28:18,756 --> 00:28:20,948
Didn’t Van and Farm come with you?

432
00:28:22,978 --> 00:28:25,750
I don’t think those two are coming.

433
00:28:26,241 --> 00:28:27,350
What happened?

434
00:28:30,149 --> 00:28:32,506
I knew it would turn out like this.

435
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:34,824
What was Farm thinking?

436
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:36,343
He liked Van that much,

437
00:28:36,514 --> 00:28:38,119
yet decided to become his roommate.

438
00:28:39,871 --> 00:28:44,082
Don’t tell me you knew Farm liked Van too.

439
00:28:44,082 --> 00:28:45,036
Of course.

440
00:28:45,036 --> 00:28:46,166
I could see it with my eyes closed.

441
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:48,488
How could you see anything
with your eyes closed?

442
00:28:48,659 --> 00:28:50,348
It’s an expression, shithead.

443
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:52,537
Damn it.

444
00:28:52,537 --> 00:28:54,046
My head’s not a volleyball.

445
00:28:54,046 --> 00:28:55,814
You guys keep smacking it around.

446
00:28:57,545 --> 00:29:00,311
So those two are secretly dating?

447
00:29:00,461 --> 00:29:02,987
From what I can tell, yeah.

448
00:29:05,829 --> 00:29:06,352
Mm.

449
00:29:08,296 --> 00:29:10,322
But based on what you told us,

450
00:29:10,493 --> 00:29:11,798
I have one question.

451
00:29:12,332 --> 00:29:13,964
Does Van actually like Farm?

452
00:29:15,015 --> 00:29:15,772
Right.

453
00:29:17,396 --> 00:29:18,571
That’s a good question.

454
00:29:24,233 --> 00:29:25,593
Mai asked if we want to
grab something to eat.

455
00:29:26,576 --> 00:29:27,442
I’ve got errands to run.

456
00:29:28,062 --> 00:29:29,276
Excuse me.

457
00:29:30,238 --> 00:29:31,640
- Shit.
- Shit.

458
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,548
Farm’s gone full hell mode.

459
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:28,058
Hey.

460
00:30:31,731 --> 00:30:32,589
Are you asleep?

461
00:31:26,868 --> 00:31:27,555
Farm.

462
00:32:12,294 --> 00:32:12,794
Hey.

463
00:32:13,751 --> 00:32:14,512
How’s it going?

464
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:17,040
Where’s Van?

465
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:18,305
Didn’t you come together?

466
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:22,387
I had something to do this morning,
so I left first.

467
00:32:24,836 --> 00:32:25,661
Are you guys fighting?

468
00:32:26,116 --> 00:32:26,706
No.

469
00:32:32,275 --> 00:32:33,508
Speaking of the devil.

470
00:32:34,968 --> 00:32:36,073
I’m hungry. Have you all eaten?

471
00:32:37,313 --> 00:32:38,692
We already ate.

472
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,123
But Farm just got here,

473
00:32:40,123 --> 00:32:41,212
so I don’t think he’s eaten yet.

474
00:32:41,212 --> 00:32:42,868
You two should go grab—

475
00:32:42,868 --> 00:32:44,167
My pattern isn’t finished yet.

476
00:32:44,936 --> 00:32:45,858
I’ll see you guys in class.

477
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,442
Hey, Farm.

478
00:33:03,164 --> 00:33:04,683
How do we do this part again?

479
00:33:10,844 --> 00:33:11,559
Hey.

480
00:33:12,971 --> 00:33:14,259
Can you show me…

481
00:33:21,553 --> 00:33:22,726
- Shit.
- Shit.

482
00:33:25,033 --> 00:33:26,876
Farm’s gone full hell mode.

483
00:33:27,378 --> 00:33:29,355
Damn right. He’s terrifying.

484
00:33:42,411 --> 00:33:44,502
Guys, Mai asked if we want to
grab something to eat.

485
00:33:48,552 --> 00:33:49,341
I’ve got errands to run.

486
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:51,176
Excuse me.

487
00:33:55,947 --> 00:33:57,936
You want to tell people about us, don’t you?

488
00:33:58,313 --> 00:33:58,986
Fine.

489
00:33:59,896 --> 00:34:01,074
We’re dating.

490
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,803
Are you happy now?

491
00:34:05,974 --> 00:34:07,869
Now I did everything you asked.

492
00:34:08,230 --> 00:34:09,133
What more do you want?

493
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,281
Say what you want!

494
00:34:14,532 --> 00:34:15,970
Don’t stay quiet. I don’t like it.

495
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:20,301
I f*cking regret
gambling our friendship on this shit.

496
00:34:24,021 --> 00:34:25,542
Farm, I’m sorry. I lost my head.

497
00:34:25,542 --> 00:34:27,027
Why did you stall when I asked you before?

498
00:34:29,444 --> 00:34:30,184
I’m sorry.

499
00:34:31,157 --> 00:34:33,274
I can’t take any more of your apologies, Van.

500
00:34:35,299 --> 00:34:36,489
I really am sorry.

501
00:34:37,446 --> 00:34:39,502
I’m an asshole. It’s all my fault.

502
00:34:40,146 --> 00:34:41,620
Damn it. I’m really sorry.

503
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,938
Is that how you truly feel,

504
00:34:45,173 --> 00:34:47,313
or is it just the same line
you used to escape your exes?

505
00:34:47,611 --> 00:34:48,956
It’s not like that at all.

506
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:50,255
Do you date me

507
00:34:51,448 --> 00:34:53,520
because you actually have feelings for me,
or because you want something?

508
00:34:57,491 --> 00:34:59,035
You two should separate for now.

509
00:34:59,755 --> 00:35:01,061
Talk again after you cool down.

510
00:35:01,344 --> 00:35:01,895
Yeah?

511
00:35:04,108 --> 00:35:04,766
Right.

512
00:35:08,354 --> 00:35:09,292
Farm, wait.

513
00:35:09,418 --> 00:35:10,049
Van.

514
00:35:11,273 --> 00:35:12,797
Even if you chase after him now,
nothing’s going to get resolved.

515
00:35:16,454 --> 00:35:17,347
Calm down.

516
00:35:28,151 --> 00:35:31,513
Mai said Van’s staying with him tonight.

517
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:35,052
Can we trust him?

518
00:35:35,272 --> 00:35:36,005
Mai, I mean.

519
00:35:39,348 --> 00:35:40,312
So much trouble.

520
00:35:41,112 --> 00:35:42,930
I’m so damn fed up.

521
00:35:43,856 --> 00:35:44,469
Come on.

522
00:35:45,081 --> 00:35:46,837
Teenage love is usually like this.

523
00:35:49,223 --> 00:35:50,235
That sounded really old.

524
00:35:51,114 --> 00:35:52,657
Did you remember that
from ten years in the future?

525
00:35:56,973 --> 00:35:57,934
Do you like it, though?

526
00:35:59,362 --> 00:36:00,332
Am I giving off a dad vibe?

527
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,257
Gosh.

528
00:36:05,245 --> 00:36:05,967
Oh, hey.

529
00:36:06,972 --> 00:36:09,546
Have you ever had
a vision of Farm, Van, and Mai?

530
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:10,986
In the future, I mean.

531
00:36:12,289 --> 00:36:13,462
Do we stay friends?

532
00:36:23,818 --> 00:36:24,501
Sometimes, yeah.

533
00:36:25,254 --> 00:36:25,930
Really?

534
00:36:26,024 --> 00:36:27,031
What’s it like?

535
00:36:28,648 --> 00:36:29,460
Well…

536
00:36:31,124 --> 00:36:32,713
we all stay friends.

537
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:35,991
Uh-huh. And?

538
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:37,378
That’s about it.

539
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:39,829
No way.

540
00:36:40,394 --> 00:36:42,997
Will Farm and Van still be boyfriends?

541
00:36:43,813 --> 00:36:45,130
Will Mai graduate?

542
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:46,603
Or will he drop out for a bit to save his ass?

543
00:36:49,052 --> 00:36:50,370
I only saw a glimpse.

544
00:36:50,605 --> 00:36:51,954
I can’t really tell.

545
00:36:55,344 --> 00:36:56,420
That’s no help.

546
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:58,780
Just know that we’re all still friends.

547
00:36:59,250 --> 00:36:59,901
That’s good enough, right?

548
00:37:03,229 --> 00:37:04,396
Go take a shower.

549
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:05,949
So I can use the bathroom after.

550
00:37:06,451 --> 00:37:07,552
Hey, hey!

551
00:37:07,552 --> 00:37:08,155
Go.

552
00:37:21,876 --> 00:37:22,580
What are you doing here?

553
00:37:23,161 --> 00:37:24,768
I thought this ended a long time ago.

554
00:37:26,008 --> 00:37:27,391
I came to see Mom, son.

555
00:37:57,529 --> 00:37:58,260
Open the door!

556
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:00,090
Jinn, calm down.

557
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:02,354
Mom! Open up!

558
00:38:05,251 --> 00:38:05,835
Mom!

559
00:38:10,846 --> 00:38:11,414
Jinn.

560
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:13,319
Jinn. Jinn. Jinn.

561
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:14,170
Get out!

562
00:38:15,097 --> 00:38:16,670
Let me explain first, son.

563
00:38:18,451 --> 00:38:19,179
What are you doing here?

564
00:38:19,744 --> 00:38:21,311
I thought this ended a long time ago.

565
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:23,150
I…

566
00:38:24,425 --> 00:38:26,196
I asked, what are you doing here?

567
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:31,337
I came to see Mom, son.

568
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,420
You have the nerve to say that.

569
00:38:34,941 --> 00:38:36,079
Explain this, Mom.

570
00:38:40,258 --> 00:38:40,758
Mom?

571
00:38:43,843 --> 00:38:44,511
Well…

572
00:38:45,452 --> 00:38:46,607
Dad and I…

573
00:38:47,577 --> 00:38:49,613
we’ve been back together for a while now.

574
00:38:52,336 --> 00:38:54,107
So you’ve been lying to me?

575
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,603
No.

576
00:38:55,835 --> 00:38:58,793
If I’d told you, you would’ve reacted like this.

577
00:38:58,967 --> 00:38:59,978
Of course I would!

578
00:39:01,716 --> 00:39:03,123
How could you forget things so easily?

579
00:39:03,427 --> 00:39:04,689
He left us, Mom!

580
00:39:05,529 --> 00:39:06,548
He walked away without even talking to us.

581
00:39:06,779 --> 00:39:08,184
And now he thinks he can just come back?

582
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,195
Give me a chance to fix this, son.

583
00:39:09,195 --> 00:39:10,361
You’re not my dad!

584
00:39:10,361 --> 00:39:11,008
Jinn.

585
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:13,366
And I’m not your son!

586
00:39:13,815 --> 00:39:14,414
Jinn!

587
00:39:16,225 --> 00:39:18,903
If you choose him, then you don’t need me.

588
00:39:19,164 --> 00:39:19,768
Jinn!

589
00:39:21,897 --> 00:39:22,397
Jinn.

590
00:39:23,628 --> 00:39:24,128
Jinn.

591
00:39:25,084 --> 00:39:25,660
Son.

592
00:39:26,414 --> 00:39:28,838
If you choose him, then you don’t need me.

593
00:39:29,316 --> 00:39:29,927
Jinn.

594
00:39:31,013 --> 00:39:31,550
Jinn.

595
00:39:31,985 --> 00:39:32,661
Son.

596
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:39,659
Jinn.

597
00:39:42,348 --> 00:39:43,253
Wait for me, Jinn.

598
00:39:43,253 --> 00:39:44,028
Son.

599
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,729
If you choose him, then you don’t need me.

600
00:40:01,004 --> 00:40:02,163
- Jinn.
- Jinn.

601
00:40:31,617 --> 00:40:32,548
Jinn, don’t.

602
00:40:32,548 --> 00:40:33,048
Jinn.

603
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:34,790
Jinn.

604
00:40:38,715 --> 00:40:39,215
Jinn.

605
00:40:40,148 --> 00:40:40,831
Jinn, don’t.

606
00:40:41,251 --> 00:40:42,226
Damn it, J!

607
00:40:43,685 --> 00:40:44,568
What the hell are you doing?

608
00:40:44,829 --> 00:40:45,869
You almost fell.

609
00:40:49,771 --> 00:40:50,479
J!

610
00:40:55,221 --> 00:40:56,525
Is this really you?

611
00:40:57,915 --> 00:40:59,378
Is this real or a dream?

612
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,086
I don’t know anymore, Jinn.

613
00:41:02,302 --> 00:41:03,254
I don’t know.

614
00:41:04,051 --> 00:41:05,256
I don’t know…

615
00:41:06,255 --> 00:41:07,158
I don’t.

616
00:41:07,708 --> 00:41:08,698
J, take it easy.

617
00:41:11,414 --> 00:41:12,170
Calm down.

618
00:41:13,025 --> 00:41:14,265
Are you really okay?

619
00:41:16,235 --> 00:41:17,147
I’m okay, J.

620
00:41:20,464 --> 00:41:21,191
I’m fine.

621
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:38,327
It was just a dream.

622
00:41:40,514 --> 00:41:41,318
I’m right here.

623
00:41:46,293 --> 00:41:47,193
Promise me

624
00:41:48,424 --> 00:41:49,804
you’ll be okay.

625
00:41:52,107 --> 00:41:52,707
I promise.

626
00:41:54,908 --> 00:41:56,154
I promise I’ll be fine.

627
00:42:33,598 --> 00:42:34,628
Everything will be alright.

628
00:42:37,655 --> 00:42:38,390
It’ll be okay.

629
00:42:55,921 --> 00:42:57,379
Come with us, new friend.

630
00:42:57,509 --> 00:42:59,986
Aren’t people in a relationship
supposed to love each other?

631
00:43:00,087 --> 00:43:01,978
I thought I’d grow to love him someday.

632
00:43:01,978 --> 00:43:03,566
You’re really gonna sleep in this position?

633
00:43:03,566 --> 00:43:05,228
I’m scared you’ll sleepwalk
and do things again.

634
00:43:05,228 --> 00:43:08,484
But I can still do things in this position.

635
00:43:08,629 --> 00:43:09,347
Damn you, asshole.

636
00:43:09,347 --> 00:43:11,278
There’s been a lot to think about lately.

637
00:43:11,278 --> 00:43:12,772
And Van and Farm are like this too.

638
00:43:12,917 --> 00:43:13,723
If you’re tired, get some rest.

639
00:43:13,723 --> 00:43:15,151
Leave the rest to me.

640
00:43:15,151 --> 00:43:17,270
You’re the one I should be worried about the most.

641
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:18,115
What are you doing?

642
00:43:18,115 --> 00:43:19,762
I asked you to sniff me, but you didn’t move.
