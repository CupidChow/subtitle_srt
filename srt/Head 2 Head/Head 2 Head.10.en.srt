4
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:14,914
Two years after Auntie Jan’s death…

5
00:00:15,097 --> 00:00:16,978
You’ll disappear for seven years.

6
00:00:17,182 --> 00:00:19,032
We’ll meet again when we’re 30.

7
00:00:21,746 --> 00:00:23,463
You’re not like this because of me, are you?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,034
I love you.

9
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:26,590
Do you love me?

10
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,755
I’ve always loved you.

11
00:00:28,753 --> 00:00:29,766
Since we were seven.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,208
Let go of Van’s arm already.

13
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,639
I’ve been clinging to him for years.

14
00:00:33,639 --> 00:00:34,898
He’s my boyfriend now.

15
00:00:35,224 --> 00:00:35,931
Farm!

16
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,085
Don’t joke like that.

17
00:00:39,185 --> 00:00:40,535
I f*cking regret

18
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,548
gambling our friendship on this shit.

19
00:00:43,548 --> 00:00:46,296
If you choose him, then you don’t need me.

20
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,279
Jinn!

21
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:48,260
Jinn, son!

22
00:00:56,917 --> 00:00:57,812
J.

23
00:00:58,362 --> 00:01:00,482
Did you hear some noise?

24
00:01:01,236 --> 00:01:02,092
J?

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,421
Shit, J!

26
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:13,858
J!

27
00:01:14,612 --> 00:01:15,602
What the hell are you doing?

28
00:01:15,602 --> 00:01:16,755
You almost fell.

29
00:01:19,932 --> 00:01:20,844
J!

30
00:01:22,596 --> 00:01:24,042
Is this really you?

31
00:01:25,264 --> 00:01:26,820
Is this real or a dream?

32
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,610
I don’t know anymore, Jinn.

33
00:01:29,628 --> 00:01:30,685
I don’t know.

34
00:01:33,578 --> 00:01:34,664
I don’t know…

35
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:36,186
J, take it easy.

36
00:01:38,263 --> 00:01:39,488
Are you really okay?

37
00:01:41,423 --> 00:01:42,469
I’m okay, J.

38
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:50,616
It was just a dream.

39
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:53,636
I’m right here.

40
00:01:58,484 --> 00:01:59,545
Promise me

41
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:01,886
you’ll be okay.

42
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:04,987
I promise.

43
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:08,221
I promise I’ll be fine.

44
00:03:58,124 --> 00:03:59,988
I’m so not used to seeing you like this.

45
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,742
Me neither.

46
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:03,545
Suddenly, alcohol doesn’t taste as good.

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,945
Hey, about you and Farm,
are you really dating?

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,556
Yeah.

49
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:16,466
I asked him to be my boyfriend.

50
00:04:18,136 --> 00:04:18,886
And then?

51
00:04:19,782 --> 00:04:21,500
You can see how good he is to me.

52
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:24,120
Especially after we became roommates.

53
00:04:24,588 --> 00:04:26,079
He takes really good care of me.

54
00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:29,927
And I’ve known for a while that

55
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,093
he doesn’t see me as just a friend.

56
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,535
So he treats you well,

57
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:36,420
and that made you like him. Is that it?

58
00:04:38,823 --> 00:04:39,921
I’m not sure.

59
00:04:43,832 --> 00:04:47,314
You’re not sure, yet you’re the one
who asked him to be your boyfriend?

60
00:04:48,312 --> 00:04:49,729
What is this? I don’t get it.

61
00:04:51,847 --> 00:04:53,314
I don’t want to lose him to anyone.

62
00:04:54,108 --> 00:04:56,417
Are you saying that—

63
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:57,198
He likes me,

64
00:04:57,809 --> 00:04:59,137
and I feel comfortable being with him.

65
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:00,959
Isn’t that enough?

66
00:05:02,283 --> 00:05:03,718
But aren’t people in a relationship

67
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,010
supposed to love each other?

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,022
Van, you prick.

69
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:15,257
It’s Farm’s feelings we’re talking about here.

70
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:18,080
You’re treating him like he’s a toy.

71
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:20,494
You know I have no one in my life.

72
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:24,627
He came in and became my new home.

73
00:05:25,442 --> 00:05:27,363
Being with him makes me feel so warm.

74
00:05:27,913 --> 00:05:29,537
He feels like real family.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,120
So you’re using a boyfriend label
to keep him tied to you.

76
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:38,125
Do you really not see how selfish that is?

77
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,250
I…

78
00:05:42,352 --> 00:05:44,585
I thought I’d grow to love him someday.

79
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:46,051
Van, you asshole.

80
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:49,518
Why are you so angry?

81
00:05:51,575 --> 00:05:53,205
Because your logic is messed up.

82
00:05:53,205 --> 00:05:54,000
Mai.

83
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,067
You knew all too well he liked you,

84
00:05:58,902 --> 00:06:01,203
and you still did this to him.

85
00:06:04,951 --> 00:06:08,673
You don’t get to use your loneliness
as an excuse to do something wrong.

86
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,290
That excuse doesn’t even make sense.

87
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,026
Hey, don’t you think that’s too harsh?

88
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,577
All the crap you pulled with your exes,
all we could do was lecture you.

89
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,333
But this is Farm.

90
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,850
You shouldn’t have done it.

91
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:25,433
And I’m telling you this straight.

92
00:06:25,922 --> 00:06:30,000
Someone like Farm wouldn’t have left you,
even if you didn’t pull this shit.

93
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:31,674
But you did this anyway.

94
00:06:32,815 --> 00:06:34,093
Now you’re gonna lose him for real.

95
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:10,679
Why are you not sleeping?

96
00:07:12,655 --> 00:07:14,949
You have a fever. Your body’s burning up.

97
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,918
I’ll do my best to end everything.

98
00:07:24,346 --> 00:07:25,515
Just wait for me.

99
00:07:27,552 --> 00:07:29,359
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

100
00:07:30,948 --> 00:07:34,602
But I believe you can handle it.

101
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,984
Did you call to yell at me again, Mai?

102
00:08:22,984 --> 00:08:25,897
(I’m sorry. I lost my temper earlier.)

103
00:08:26,203 --> 00:08:27,752
(Where are you? I’ll come get you.)

104
00:08:28,078 --> 00:08:28,787
No need.

105
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,576
(Not the time to sulk.)

106
00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:33,019
(If you’re not staying with me,
where are you crashing tonight?)

107
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:37,140
I’m not sulking. I’m at Farm’s.

108
00:08:37,323 --> 00:08:38,580
(Are you out of your mind?

109
00:08:38,743 --> 00:08:40,360
You’re going to get kicked out.)

110
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:44,183
(You know how Farm gets when he’s angry.)

111
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:45,602
He won’t do that to me.

112
00:08:45,948 --> 00:08:48,232
(Are you gonna exploit his kind heart again?)

113
00:08:48,354 --> 00:08:49,650
(Don’t even think about it, jerk.)

114
00:08:49,976 --> 00:08:51,628
Yeah, I know.

115
00:08:51,628 --> 00:08:52,870
I’ve realized how shitty my actions were.

116
00:08:53,827 --> 00:08:55,672
I came here to apologize

117
00:08:55,672 --> 00:08:57,156
and tell him the truth.

118
00:08:57,482 --> 00:08:59,008
(You came to your senses too easily.)

119
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,882
Mai, you dipshit. What do you want from me?

120
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:04,627
(Fine. It’s good that you’ve reflected.)

121
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,713
(Leave Farm out of this.)

122
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,855
(He can’t handle heartbreak. You know that.)

123
00:09:11,016 --> 00:09:11,797
Yeah.

124
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:14,390
Thanks for
knocking some sense into me.

125
00:09:14,858 --> 00:09:16,616
(Call me anytime.)

126
00:09:31,378 --> 00:09:32,843
PATCH THINGS UP WITH HIM.

127
00:09:32,843 --> 00:09:34,781
TELL HIM YOURSELF.

128
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:36,483
IT’S BETTER THAN LETTING HIM
HEAR IT FROM SOMEONE ELSE.

129
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:38,205
HE’S SO DAMN IN LOVE WITH YOU.

130
00:09:38,388 --> 00:09:42,657
IMAGINE HOW BROKEN HE’LL BE
IF HE FINDS OUT YOU’VE BEEN PLAYING WITH HIS FEELINGS.

131
00:09:42,922 --> 00:09:44,833
IF YOU DON’T LOVE HIM, SAY IT.

132
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:47,977
IT’LL HURT LESS THAN
PRETENDING YOU DO.

133
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,083
I’M HERE FOR YOU, MAN.
JUST ONE CALL AWAY.

134
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,056
THANKS, DUDE.

135
00:10:17,856 --> 00:10:19,181
Can you stop smoking?

136
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,091
I need to talk to you.

137
00:10:21,946 --> 00:10:24,244
When I said I wanted our love to work out,

138
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:26,103
how did you feel after hearing it?

139
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:29,058
Farm.

140
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,215
Did you go through my phone?

141
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:42,555
Am I a freaking joke to you?

142
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:45,902
You guys are so damn good.

143
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:47,415
How did you manage not to laugh?

144
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:49,594
It’s not like that.

145
00:10:49,594 --> 00:10:52,560
I’m a complete moron
for falling for an asshole like you.

146
00:10:53,273 --> 00:10:54,110
F*ck.

147
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,957
I’m sorry. Did I wake you?

148
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:31,051
I didn’t hear the alarm.

149
00:11:32,273 --> 00:11:33,264
It hasn’t gone off yet.

150
00:11:38,987 --> 00:11:40,534
We still have half an hour.

151
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,547
Come up and sleep on the bed.

152
00:11:56,431 --> 00:11:58,013
Let go of my arm, maybe?

153
00:11:58,624 --> 00:12:00,357
No.

154
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:02,081
Why not?

155
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:05,289
I’m afraid it’ll be like last night.

156
00:12:07,672 --> 00:12:08,715
Are you worried about me?

157
00:12:10,202 --> 00:12:11,200
Mm.

158
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,602
Do you love me?

159
00:12:27,702 --> 00:12:28,496
Mm…

160
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:30,044
What was that?

161
00:12:30,675 --> 00:12:31,857
Yes.

162
00:12:32,506 --> 00:12:33,357
You love who?

163
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,672
I love you.

164
00:12:36,752 --> 00:12:37,551
Who?

165
00:12:39,588 --> 00:12:41,572
I love you, J.

166
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,966
Come with us, new friend.

167
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:01,521
Is this the exact spot
where we became friends?

168
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:02,816
J, you’re dead!

169
00:13:03,427 --> 00:13:04,368
You, move!

170
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:04,868
Let go of my hair.

171
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:05,560
Stop!

172
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,001
Who the hell are you guys?

173
00:13:30,566 --> 00:13:32,426
Will you stop watching it? Are you nuts?

174
00:13:33,237 --> 00:13:33,737
No.

175
00:13:35,473 --> 00:13:36,382
Hey!

176
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:37,791
Don’t.

177
00:13:38,635 --> 00:13:39,656
You’re cute here.

178
00:13:41,423 --> 00:13:42,034
J!

179
00:13:45,227 --> 00:13:45,727
J.

180
00:13:46,977 --> 00:13:47,678
Hey.

181
00:13:49,609 --> 00:13:50,766
Mai, what’s wrong with you?

182
00:13:50,944 --> 00:13:51,469
Guys!

183
00:13:51,469 --> 00:13:52,053
What?

184
00:13:52,491 --> 00:13:53,619
We’ve got a huge problem.

185
00:13:56,839 --> 00:13:58,671
You know we’re
the only safe place Farm has.

186
00:13:59,369 --> 00:14:01,707
It wasn’t easy for him
to open up to us like this.

187
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:05,539
Yell at me all you want.

188
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,722
I’ll take it. This is all on me.

189
00:14:09,312 --> 00:14:10,231
What are you going to do now?

190
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,674
Farm.

191
00:14:27,372 --> 00:14:29,098
If you’re not comfortable
with me in the group,

192
00:14:29,487 --> 00:14:30,794
I can leave.

193
00:14:31,725 --> 00:14:32,937
You can come back and join them.

194
00:14:35,063 --> 00:14:35,989
Stay the hell out of my business.

195
00:14:49,278 --> 00:14:51,945
I think this is harder than we thought.

196
00:14:56,358 --> 00:14:57,349
I’ll take it from here.

197
00:15:22,718 --> 00:15:26,086
I kind of miss this place somehow.

198
00:15:32,717 --> 00:15:36,028
Is this the exact spot
where we became friends?

199
00:15:37,679 --> 00:15:39,357
Jinn, this is the library.

200
00:15:40,834 --> 00:15:41,627
I don’t care.

201
00:15:41,627 --> 00:15:45,870
I’ll chase you to hell if that means
I can draw every drop of blood out of you.

202
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,893
You’re so dead, J!

203
00:15:47,396 --> 00:15:47,911
Hey.

204
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:49,665
You, move!

205
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:50,403
Calm down.

206
00:15:51,036 --> 00:15:51,536
Hey!

207
00:15:51,612 --> 00:15:52,952
Would you calm down?

208
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,787
Jinn, let go of my hair.

209
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:54,805
Stop! Stop!

210
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:56,906
Who the hell are you guys?

211
00:15:59,927 --> 00:16:03,840
You two are the reason I ended up on
the library’s blacklist for the entire semester

212
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,915
for causing trouble.

213
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,629
Blame Jinn. I didn’t start it.

214
00:16:15,734 --> 00:16:17,207
Come to think of it, I’m quite surprised

215
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:22,504
that the disastrous 2Js ended up together.

216
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,959
Disastrous?

217
00:16:24,819 --> 00:16:25,356
Yeah.

218
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:31,430
And do you remember that?

219
00:16:32,923 --> 00:16:33,491
What?

220
00:16:36,217 --> 00:16:37,407
Our deal.

221
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,845
So how did it go? Who won this round?

222
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,980
Oh wow, seriously?

223
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,082
Who won?

224
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:59,202
What were you guys thinking,
fighting in the library?

225
00:16:59,624 --> 00:17:00,959
He was the one who ran in there.

226
00:17:01,056 --> 00:17:03,332
You’re the idiot. Don’t pin this on me.

227
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,990
Where are you going?

228
00:17:09,716 --> 00:17:12,333
We feel bad dragging you into this mess.

229
00:17:13,307 --> 00:17:15,796
Why don’t you let this asshole
buy you a drink as an apology?

230
00:17:16,218 --> 00:17:17,286
Why me, you stupid jerk?

231
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,292
And here we go again.

232
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,232
Come on.

233
00:17:20,514 --> 00:17:22,293
Come with us, new friend.

234
00:17:32,757 --> 00:17:33,398
Yeah.

235
00:17:34,436 --> 00:17:34,936
Let’s go.

236
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:36,750
Let’s go.

237
00:17:37,091 --> 00:17:38,172
The old friends should tag along too.

238
00:17:48,167 --> 00:17:49,209
What’s with you?

239
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:49,879
Why do you keep nudging me?

240
00:17:50,236 --> 00:17:51,304
Look at his last name.

241
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,517
Catch the last train… what?

242
00:17:53,517 --> 00:17:56,677
Not the last train. I said his last name.

243
00:17:58,218 --> 00:17:59,026
Holy shit!

244
00:18:00,649 --> 00:18:02,346
Why do you have the same last name
as the owner of this university?

245
00:18:02,346 --> 00:18:02,846
What?

246
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:04,824
Seriously?

247
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,687
I’m just a distant relative.

248
00:18:10,878 --> 00:18:12,118
A distant relative?

249
00:18:12,426 --> 00:18:13,673
So what are you, then?

250
00:18:13,673 --> 00:18:16,798
A hotel heir? A mall owner? A politician?

251
00:18:17,025 --> 00:18:18,941
What are you even talking about, Mai?

252
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,548
Well, look at his last name.

253
00:18:20,873 --> 00:18:24,532
It’s one of the top five
wealthiest families in the country.

254
00:18:24,532 --> 00:18:26,880
Damn.

255
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:29,008
Will you excuse me?

256
00:18:29,138 --> 00:18:30,296
Hey, hey!

257
00:18:43,339 --> 00:18:44,937
I’m not as rich as you guys think.

258
00:18:45,067 --> 00:18:48,408
I’m just a distant relative who
happens to share the same last name.

259
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:51,731
Just leave me alone.

260
00:18:53,208 --> 00:18:54,714
I’m not who you think I am.

261
00:18:57,586 --> 00:18:59,344
What have you been through, huh?

262
00:19:00,188 --> 00:19:01,924
Why are your walls so high?

263
00:19:02,557 --> 00:19:04,834
But that’s fine. I’m a really good climber.

264
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:05,887
Eiei.

265
00:19:07,948 --> 00:19:08,673
Alright.

266
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:13,032
I’m sorry about my friend for being nosy
and digging into your background.

267
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:15,689
I’m sorry, sir.

268
00:19:17,214 --> 00:19:18,748
And as an apology,

269
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:22,733
I officially allow you to join our friend group.

270
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:24,135
Yay!

271
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:30,697
Yay! Come on. Say it.

272
00:19:32,745 --> 00:19:33,992
How is that an apology, dumbass?

273
00:19:34,219 --> 00:19:36,349
Did you even ask
if he wants to be friends with us?

274
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,181
Can I ask you guys one thing?

275
00:19:40,236 --> 00:19:43,086
I just want to be a normal university student.

276
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:44,317
Deal.

277
00:19:45,128 --> 00:19:49,052
As long as you stop
hiding out in the library alone.

278
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,003
You’ve got a group now.

279
00:19:52,684 --> 00:19:54,297
No need to go solo, right?

280
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:56,767
If you’re okay with it,

281
00:19:58,795 --> 00:19:59,605
I’m okay too.

282
00:20:01,438 --> 00:20:02,529
So, what do you say, buddy?

283
00:20:03,924 --> 00:20:04,667
Mm.

284
00:20:05,381 --> 00:20:08,234
- Gosh, my muscles are sore.
- Right.

285
00:20:10,392 --> 00:20:11,364
What are you guys doing?

286
00:20:17,328 --> 00:20:18,971
Why did you want to
be friends with me back then?

287
00:20:23,303 --> 00:20:27,639
Do you want the honest answer,
or the sugarcoated one?

288
00:20:27,753 --> 00:20:28,795
Don’t be an ass, J.

289
00:20:29,785 --> 00:20:30,489
I’m just kidding.

290
00:20:33,962 --> 00:20:37,019
You just seemed lonely. And kind of strange.

291
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:38,779
Strange how?

292
00:20:41,505 --> 00:20:46,039
How many rich people try that hard
to hide who they are, as you did?

293
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:48,648
Look at your place, your car,

294
00:20:49,411 --> 00:20:50,727
everything you use.

295
00:20:52,025 --> 00:20:56,176
If I hadn’t known your last name, I never
would’ve guessed who you really were.

296
00:20:57,182 --> 00:20:58,440
I don’t want anyone to know.

297
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:01,004
And I don’t want to be part of that family.

298
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:05,061
I just want to live a normal life.

299
00:21:06,002 --> 00:21:07,027
Well, here it is.

300
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,532
We’re giving you a normal life.

301
00:21:13,927 --> 00:21:14,554
Yeah.

302
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,621
Students.

303
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:19,508
The library will be closing soon.

304
00:21:22,055 --> 00:21:22,555
Hey.

305
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,352
Same place?

306
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:27,763
It feels like we’ve had
a lot to think about lately.

307
00:21:27,763 --> 00:21:29,593
And now Van and Farm are being like this.

308
00:21:29,593 --> 00:21:30,830
If you’re tired, get some rest.

309
00:21:31,609 --> 00:21:33,358
Leave the rest with me.

310
00:21:33,552 --> 00:21:35,934
You’re the one
I should be worried about the most.

311
00:21:56,051 --> 00:21:58,062
How long has it been
since we were last up here?

312
00:22:01,262 --> 00:22:02,271
Not that long.

313
00:22:03,231 --> 00:22:04,807
Ever since you quit.

314
00:22:10,847 --> 00:22:14,989
I forgot this was where
we used to sneak up to smoke.

315
00:22:16,089 --> 00:22:19,886
Being here without smoking
actually feels kind of nice.

316
00:22:23,406 --> 00:22:24,023
J.

317
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:26,977
You can go back to him.

318
00:22:29,957 --> 00:22:30,999
I’m serious.

319
00:22:33,219 --> 00:22:34,747
I think I handle
being alone better than he does.

320
00:22:36,327 --> 00:22:36,965
Farm.

321
00:22:38,545 --> 00:22:42,143
I was the last one to join the group.

322
00:22:43,743 --> 00:22:45,807
If someone has to leave,

323
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:47,321
it should be me, right?

324
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:52,243
You are so you.

325
00:22:53,903 --> 00:22:55,637
Always caring about everything in the world.

326
00:22:56,277 --> 00:22:57,329
Except yourself.

327
00:23:00,789 --> 00:23:05,782
Because I know
how much it hurts to feel abandoned.

328
00:23:11,262 --> 00:23:12,425
Answer me honestly.

329
00:23:13,045 --> 00:23:16,766
Do you think you can go back
to being friends with Van?

330
00:23:18,506 --> 00:23:20,684
I know I started this.

331
00:23:22,084 --> 00:23:23,442
If I hadn’t liked him in the first place,

332
00:23:24,662 --> 00:23:26,309
none of this would’ve happened.

333
00:23:27,209 --> 00:23:28,376
Don’t put this on yourself.

334
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:32,432
I just feel so heartbroken.

335
00:23:33,892 --> 00:23:35,572
My parents don’t love each other.

336
00:23:36,692 --> 00:23:38,552
They stay together for convenience.

337
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:41,895
They’ve always told me

338
00:23:42,915 --> 00:23:44,516
true love doesn’t exist.

339
00:23:46,336 --> 00:23:47,082
But you know what?

340
00:23:48,902 --> 00:23:50,518
I never believed them.

341
00:23:53,358 --> 00:23:55,009
I kept hoping that one day

342
00:23:56,629 --> 00:23:58,364
I’d love someone so deeply,

343
00:23:59,844 --> 00:24:02,032
and let them know true love does exist.

344
00:24:07,752 --> 00:24:12,476
But what Van did to me was
a slap in the face that woke me up.

345
00:24:13,596 --> 00:24:16,127
He made me realize
my parents’ words were right after all.

346
00:24:16,627 --> 00:24:18,563
Maybe true love really doesn’t exist.

347
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:24,581
It does.

348
00:24:25,701 --> 00:24:28,215
What you believe in is real.

349
00:24:31,195 --> 00:24:34,549
I know how much this hurts you,

350
00:24:35,449 --> 00:24:37,286
but time will help.

351
00:24:39,845 --> 00:24:41,441
And so will we.

352
00:24:47,641 --> 00:24:49,979
As for me going back to Van,

353
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,752
have you forgotten we’re a group of five?

354
00:24:55,372 --> 00:24:57,240
If you’re not comfortable being around him,

355
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:01,530
we’ll take turns staying with you.

356
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,629
We won’t let you be alone.

357
00:25:16,155 --> 00:25:17,748
Farm must really hate me.

358
00:25:21,068 --> 00:25:23,749
Well, you totally did shitty things to him.

359
00:25:24,069 --> 00:25:25,335
Mai.

360
00:25:27,095 --> 00:25:27,844
Sorry.

361
00:25:32,764 --> 00:25:33,501
Van.

362
00:25:38,801 --> 00:25:41,071
Gosh. Did you really have to say that, Mai?

363
00:25:52,735 --> 00:25:54,221
Oh. Yeah, okay.

364
00:25:59,101 --> 00:26:01,031
You can stay at my place for now.

365
00:26:01,031 --> 00:26:02,828
Actually, I can go home.

366
00:26:03,128 --> 00:26:04,335
That way, I won’t bother you guys.

367
00:26:04,555 --> 00:26:06,025
And why would you be alone?

368
00:26:06,185 --> 00:26:07,167
We can stick together.

369
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,101
You’re handing out permission
like you own the place.

370
00:26:11,161 --> 00:26:12,025
What about you, though?

371
00:26:12,825 --> 00:26:14,476
Never thought of going home?

372
00:26:17,276 --> 00:26:18,805
Why would I?

373
00:26:19,605 --> 00:26:21,630
This is my boyfriend’s place.

374
00:26:23,714 --> 00:26:24,859
Ah.

375
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:26,820
What?! Boyfriend?

376
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:29,657
It’s not the time.

377
00:26:30,857 --> 00:26:33,208
Van’s going to stay here
with us for a while anyway.

378
00:26:33,588 --> 00:26:36,681
We can’t keep on pretending
we hate each other, right?

379
00:26:39,201 --> 00:26:41,097
That’s gonna kill me.

380
00:26:41,477 --> 00:26:42,756
You’re annoying. Get away from me.

381
00:26:44,376 --> 00:26:45,878
I knew it.

382
00:26:45,878 --> 00:26:48,506
You two have been acting weird lately.

383
00:26:49,806 --> 00:26:50,676
It’s a long story.

384
00:26:51,016 --> 00:26:53,447
I wanted to tell you,
but I never found the right moment.

385
00:26:53,827 --> 00:26:55,760
You can wear our clothes tonight.

386
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:02,357
Farm told Mai he’ll return your stuff
once he’s done packing it.

387
00:27:04,358 --> 00:27:06,901
He wouldn’t even let me go back
to pack my own things?

388
00:27:08,401 --> 00:27:11,190
Try to understand. The wound’s still fresh.

389
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:12,528
Give him time.

390
00:27:15,368 --> 00:27:17,857
Go shower so you can get some sleep.

391
00:27:18,457 --> 00:27:20,334
It’s been a really long day.

392
00:27:21,751 --> 00:27:23,740
Mm. I’ll take the couch.

393
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:25,927
Why?

394
00:27:26,107 --> 00:27:27,842
We three have slept in the same bed before.

395
00:27:29,422 --> 00:27:33,434
In case you two want to do this and that,

396
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:35,381
I don’t want to be an audience.

397
00:27:37,027 --> 00:27:38,347
This and that, my ass.

398
00:27:40,407 --> 00:27:41,727
Yeah, whatever.

399
00:27:41,987 --> 00:27:43,725
I just need clothes and a blanket.

400
00:27:44,085 --> 00:27:45,614
I want to lie down and think by myself.

401
00:27:46,674 --> 00:27:47,334
Don’t worry about me.

402
00:27:49,154 --> 00:27:49,921
Are you sure?

403
00:27:50,181 --> 00:27:50,887
Mm.

404
00:27:51,387 --> 00:27:52,450
You’re not gonna cry?

405
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:53,920
Of course not.

406
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,360
Come on, babe.

407
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,103
Go back to our room
and have some sweet time.

408
00:27:58,823 --> 00:28:00,760
Babe, my foot. Just walk.

409
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:03,953
This is not the time.

410
00:28:26,058 --> 00:28:26,923
Are you tired?

411
00:28:29,043 --> 00:28:29,800
What’s wrong?

412
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:36,824
It feels like we’ve had
a lot to think about lately.

413
00:28:37,864 --> 00:28:39,813
And now Van and Farm are being like this.

414
00:28:46,413 --> 00:28:47,623
If you’re tired, get some rest.

415
00:28:48,223 --> 00:28:49,975
Leave the rest with me.

416
00:28:52,095 --> 00:28:54,518
You’re the one
I should be worried about the most.

417
00:29:02,638 --> 00:29:04,417
You’re really going to sleep in this position?

418
00:29:05,717 --> 00:29:06,275
Mm.

419
00:29:06,895 --> 00:29:08,008
You’re going to wake up sore.

420
00:29:09,508 --> 00:29:11,486
I’m afraid you’ll sleepwalk
and do things again.

421
00:29:12,986 --> 00:29:15,460
Let’s just sleep like this. It’s safer.

422
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:21,884
But I can still do things in this position.

423
00:29:24,744 --> 00:29:25,801
Damn you, asshole.

424
00:29:26,121 --> 00:29:27,300
I’m worried about you.

425
00:29:27,751 --> 00:29:29,224
Is that really all that’s in your head?

426
00:29:29,724 --> 00:29:30,385
What?

427
00:29:30,885 --> 00:29:32,891
I didn’t even say what kind of things.

428
00:29:35,851 --> 00:29:38,306
You know way too well.

429
00:29:39,126 --> 00:29:40,748
You’re thinking the same thing, aren’t you?

430
00:29:43,076 --> 00:29:44,139
I’m not!

431
00:29:53,748 --> 00:29:54,667
Good night.

432
00:29:54,887 --> 00:29:55,733
I love you.

433
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:04,205
Hey. What about Farm?

434
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:05,625
How is he doing?

435
00:30:18,301 --> 00:30:19,559
There, there.

436
00:30:19,779 --> 00:30:21,220
It’s okay.

437
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,413
People might not love you, but I do.

438
00:30:30,861 --> 00:30:32,385
Mai, I can’t breathe.

439
00:30:32,765 --> 00:30:34,145
Dammit. You jerk.

440
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:47,008
Can you hit the gas
and make that loud, cool sound?

441
00:30:51,841 --> 00:30:54,806
That’s it! So awesome!

442
00:30:56,406 --> 00:30:58,022
Put on your seatbelt. We’re about to go.

443
00:30:59,022 --> 00:31:00,008
My hands aren’t free.

444
00:31:00,248 --> 00:31:01,108
Do it for me.

445
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:18,663
Don’t get too close to me,

446
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:21,544
or you’ll fall in love.

447
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:25,170
If I fall, I can climb back up.

448
00:31:25,670 --> 00:31:26,801
No worries.

449
00:31:38,218 --> 00:31:40,504
(I don’t know how serious you are about us.)

450
00:31:40,724 --> 00:31:43,913
(But I want it to work out.)

451
00:31:59,996 --> 00:32:00,753
Hey.

452
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:02,648
I forgot to bring my socks.

453
00:32:02,908 --> 00:32:03,725
Can I borrow these?

454
00:32:04,525 --> 00:32:05,340
Not this pair.

455
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,767
Why?

456
00:32:09,107 --> 00:32:10,775
Then what am I supposed to wear?

457
00:32:10,775 --> 00:32:12,342
Any pair, but not this.

458
00:32:12,942 --> 00:32:15,148
What’s the problem with those socks?

459
00:32:18,332 --> 00:32:21,457
Oh, hey. What are you
going to do with Van’s stuff?

460
00:32:22,257 --> 00:32:24,116
Want me to help throw them in the bags?

461
00:32:26,636 --> 00:32:27,492
Let’s head out.

462
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:28,601
We need to be on time for roll call.

463
00:32:28,601 --> 00:32:30,068
You shithead. You ignored me.

464
00:32:34,088 --> 00:32:36,748
What kind of moving on is this?

465
00:32:36,908 --> 00:32:38,759
Three steps forward, five steps back.

466
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:39,971
Sounds like a fun dance.

467
00:32:40,671 --> 00:32:43,388
Cha, cha, cha.

468
00:32:44,268 --> 00:32:44,768
Mai.

469
00:32:44,768 --> 00:32:45,268
Yes?

470
00:32:45,268 --> 00:32:46,109
Will you hurry up?

471
00:32:46,109 --> 00:32:47,079
Of course, sir.

472
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:47,816
I’m coming.

473
00:32:57,077 --> 00:32:58,519
Wow, this is awesome.

474
00:33:01,379 --> 00:33:03,395
What’s up? Ran out of ideas?

475
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:06,978
Yeah. I can’t think of anything.

476
00:33:10,438 --> 00:33:12,070
But the deadline is approaching.

477
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,272
It’s alright.

478
00:33:14,872 --> 00:33:16,378
I’ll come up with something.

479
00:33:30,766 --> 00:33:32,189
Why are you not eating?

480
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:38,801
I’m not hungry.

481
00:33:39,541 --> 00:33:40,377
Not hungry?

482
00:33:41,737 --> 00:33:42,599
You didn’t have breakfast.

483
00:33:42,959 --> 00:33:43,948
You’re not having lunch.

484
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,242
You might die.

485
00:33:46,882 --> 00:33:48,413
Just let me freaking die.

486
00:34:15,507 --> 00:34:16,217
Farm.

487
00:34:16,217 --> 00:34:18,026
I don’t want you two
leaving things unresolved like this.

488
00:34:18,026 --> 00:34:19,417
Talk it out and clear the air.

489
00:34:19,417 --> 00:34:20,590
That could be good. Right?

490
00:34:20,970 --> 00:34:21,741
What are you doing?

491
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:23,434
I asked you to sniff me, but you didn’t move.

492
00:34:49,127 --> 00:34:50,342
Wow, you’re in deep shit.

493
00:34:52,527 --> 00:34:54,091
I don’t want Farm to feel uncomfortable.

494
00:34:56,962 --> 00:34:58,411
Why are you in my class?

495
00:34:58,411 --> 00:34:59,502
Did you even finish your assignment?

496
00:35:03,727 --> 00:35:06,441
You’re not eating. You’ve lost your passion.

497
00:35:07,506 --> 00:35:09,439
The symptoms are obvious.

498
00:35:10,342 --> 00:35:11,070
What symptoms?

499
00:35:11,648 --> 00:35:12,805
Heartbreak.

500
00:35:13,329 --> 00:35:13,882
Huh?

501
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:15,366
It’s true.

502
00:35:16,016 --> 00:35:17,248
When I broke up with my ex,

503
00:35:18,024 --> 00:35:19,526
I was exactly like this.

504
00:35:19,526 --> 00:35:20,691
Food tasted bland.

505
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:22,999
Nothing made me happy.

506
00:35:22,999 --> 00:35:24,572
I shriveled up like a rotten vegetable.

507
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:27,121
So I’m…

508
00:35:28,493 --> 00:35:29,497
heartbroken?

509
00:35:29,948 --> 00:35:31,649
Not to be pushy or anything,

510
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,403
but I don’t want you two
leaving things unresolved like this.

511
00:35:36,216 --> 00:35:39,769
At least talk it out and clear the air.

512
00:35:40,257 --> 00:35:41,688
You don’t have to get back together,

513
00:35:42,826 --> 00:35:44,756
but if you can go back to being friends,
that’d still be good. Right?

514
00:36:04,178 --> 00:36:05,576
Can you just talk to me first?

515
00:36:09,447 --> 00:36:10,313
Wait, Farm.

516
00:36:10,313 --> 00:36:11,452
What more do you want from me?

517
00:36:12,355 --> 00:36:13,456
I want to apologize.

518
00:36:14,323 --> 00:36:15,173
Is that all?

519
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,444
Hey.

520
00:36:35,784 --> 00:36:37,149
Are you being a wild teenager these days?

521
00:36:37,817 --> 00:36:40,371
I came home, and you aren’t here.

522
00:36:40,678 --> 00:36:41,890
Just so you know, I’m sulking.

523
00:36:42,323 --> 00:36:45,286
Think of a way to
make it up to me on your way home.

524
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:48,883
Alright. Bye.

525
00:36:54,192 --> 00:36:57,740
Don’t worry. This boyfriend
will keep you company in bed.

526
00:36:59,184 --> 00:36:59,891
No need.

527
00:37:00,306 --> 00:37:01,327
Don’t jump at the chance so fast.

528
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:03,606
Aw. Not falling for it?

529
00:37:09,709 --> 00:37:10,349
What’s wrong?

530
00:37:11,072 --> 00:37:11,840
Are you thinking about your mom?

531
00:37:13,411 --> 00:37:14,316
Mm.

532
00:37:15,472 --> 00:37:17,489
She’s been acting strange lately.

533
00:37:18,012 --> 00:37:19,833
It feels like something’s going on,
but she’s not telling me.

534
00:37:21,422 --> 00:37:24,070
What do you think it is?

535
00:37:27,699 --> 00:37:28,537
That man.

536
00:37:28,862 --> 00:37:29,569
Your dad?

537
00:37:29,786 --> 00:37:30,650
I don’t have a dad.

538
00:37:37,705 --> 00:37:39,233
What if…

539
00:37:39,684 --> 00:37:40,680
Hypothetically.

540
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,264
Just hypothetically.

541
00:37:42,354 --> 00:37:43,086
What if—

542
00:37:43,086 --> 00:37:44,015
No way!

543
00:37:47,662 --> 00:37:49,285
I’d rather my mom date someone new

544
00:37:49,736 --> 00:37:50,988
than go back to him.

545
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:54,502
You have no idea what she had to endure.

546
00:37:54,628 --> 00:37:57,285
His family. His fans.

547
00:37:57,917 --> 00:37:59,359
They treated my mom like she was a germ.

548
00:38:01,706 --> 00:38:04,543
I was young then, but I remember it clearly.

549
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:11,007
But that was something other people did,

550
00:38:11,765 --> 00:38:12,954
not your dad.

551
00:38:13,405 --> 00:38:15,825
I’m not saying I’m mad
at what other people did.

552
00:38:16,818 --> 00:38:21,802
You know, he didn’t just
fail to protect us. He left us.

553
00:38:22,687 --> 00:38:25,138
I don’t think my mom
ever healed from that pain.

554
00:38:26,329 --> 00:38:29,325
And I don’t think the two of them
could ever fall back in love.

555
00:38:36,862 --> 00:38:39,412
You’re my boyfriend. You must take my side.

556
00:38:40,225 --> 00:38:42,908
If we run into him,
you help me chase him off.

557
00:38:43,775 --> 00:38:44,511
Got it?

558
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:53,168
You’re the best.

559
00:38:54,522 --> 00:38:55,783
Come on. Let’s go shower.

560
00:38:55,783 --> 00:38:56,296
Mm.

561
00:38:56,296 --> 00:38:57,120
I’ll give you a shower.

562
00:38:58,709 --> 00:38:59,680
I can shower on my own.

563
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,764
No, I’m in a good mood. Come on.

564
00:39:16,615 --> 00:39:17,163
Farm.

565
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:21,584
Farm.

566
00:39:29,662 --> 00:39:30,580
Farm.

567
00:41:34,674 --> 00:41:35,983
I took a shower.

568
00:41:42,363 --> 00:41:43,664
I smell so good.

569
00:41:44,314 --> 00:41:44,931
And?

570
00:41:45,707 --> 00:41:47,099
Want to come here and sniff me?

571
00:42:03,688 --> 00:42:04,376
What are you doing?

572
00:42:05,495 --> 00:42:07,356
I asked you to sniff me, but you didn’t move.

573
00:42:10,913 --> 00:42:12,792
Because I knew if I did, it’d end up like this.

574
00:42:15,248 --> 00:42:15,861
Hey.

575
00:42:17,847 --> 00:42:18,563
J.

576
00:42:19,953 --> 00:42:20,637
J!

577
00:42:23,053 --> 00:42:23,742
You’re smart.

578
00:42:25,674 --> 00:42:27,057
Are you sleeping in here tonight?

579
00:42:30,638 --> 00:42:31,506
Then get up.

580
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:34,086
Why?

581
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,487
Up.

582
00:42:47,762 --> 00:42:49,671
I’m afraid you’ll dream
you’re Spider-Man again.

583
00:43:03,629 --> 00:43:04,361
What are you doing?

584
00:43:08,496 --> 00:43:09,352
Continuing.

585
00:43:30,544 --> 00:43:31,947
I know you’re awake.

586
00:43:32,073 --> 00:43:33,922
What should we do after waking up?

587
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:37,246
Don’t tell me you came out here to look for me.

588
00:43:37,246 --> 00:43:38,315
Well, well.

589
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:39,442
You told me to go home,

590
00:43:39,442 --> 00:43:41,725
yet here you are searching for me
all over the village.

591
00:43:42,014 --> 00:43:44,555
Look at you, newborn kitten.

592
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:46,525
What the heck is Van doing?

593
00:43:46,525 --> 00:43:48,328
Walk away from me all you want.

594
00:43:48,328 --> 00:43:50,001
I’ll still follow you and love you all the same.

595
00:43:50,164 --> 00:43:52,807
Believe me. I love you so damn much.
