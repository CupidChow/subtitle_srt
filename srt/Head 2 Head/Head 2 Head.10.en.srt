4
00:00:13,095 --> 00:00:14,914
Two years after Auntie Jan’s death…

5
00:00:15,097 --> 00:00:16,978
You’ll disappear for seven years.

6
00:00:17,182 --> 00:00:19,032
We’ll meet again when we’re 30.

7
00:00:21,746 --> 00:00:23,463
You’re not like this because of me, are you?

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,034
I love you.

9
00:00:25,278 --> 00:00:26,590
Do you love me?

10
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,755
I’ve always loved you.

11
00:00:28,753 --> 00:00:29,766
Since we were seven.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,208
Let go of Van’s arm already.

13
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,639
I’ve been clinging to him for years.

14
00:00:33,639 --> 00:00:34,898
He’s my boyfriend now.

15
00:00:35,224 --> 00:00:35,931
Farm!

16
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,085
Don’t joke like that.

17
00:00:39,185 --> 00:00:40,535
I f*cking regret

18
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,548
gambling our friendship on this shit.

19
00:00:43,548 --> 00:00:46,296
If you choose him, then you don’t need me.

20
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,279
Jinn!

21
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:48,260
Jinn, son!

22
00:00:56,917 --> 00:00:57,812
J.

23
00:00:58,362 --> 00:01:00,482
Did you hear some noise?

24
00:01:01,236 --> 00:01:02,092
J?

25
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,421
Shit, J!

26
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:13,858
J!

27
00:01:14,612 --> 00:01:15,602
What the hell are you doing?

28
00:01:15,602 --> 00:01:16,755
You almost fell.

29
00:01:19,932 --> 00:01:20,844
J!

30
00:01:22,596 --> 00:01:24,042
Is this really you?

31
00:01:25,264 --> 00:01:26,820
Is this real or a dream?

32
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,610
I don’t know anymore, Jinn.

33
00:01:29,628 --> 00:01:30,685
I don’t know.

34
00:01:33,578 --> 00:01:34,664
I don’t know…

35
00:01:35,112 --> 00:01:36,186
J, take it easy.

36
00:01:38,263 --> 00:01:39,488
Are you really okay?

37
00:01:41,423 --> 00:01:42,469
I’m okay, J.

38
00:01:49,455 --> 00:01:50,616
It was just a dream.

39
00:01:52,755 --> 00:01:53,636
I’m right here.

40
00:01:58,484 --> 00:01:59,545
Promise me

41
00:02:00,686 --> 00:02:01,886
you’ll be okay.

42
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:04,987
I promise.

43
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:08,221
I promise I’ll be fine.

44
00:03:58,124 --> 00:03:59,988
I’m so not used to seeing you like this.

45
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:01,742
Me neither.

46
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:03,545
Suddenly, alcohol doesn’t taste as good.

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,945
Hey, about you and Farm, 
are you really dating?

48
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,556
Yeah.

49
00:04:15,127 --> 00:04:16,466
I asked him to be my boyfriend.

50
00:04:18,136 --> 00:04:18,886
And then?

51
00:04:19,782 --> 00:04:21,500
You can see how good he is to me.

52
00:04:22,518 --> 00:04:24,120
Especially after we became roommates.

53
00:04:24,588 --> 00:04:26,079
He takes really good care of me.

54
00:04:28,544 --> 00:04:29,927
And I’ve known for a while that

55
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,093
he doesn’t see me as just a friend.

56
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,535
So he treats you well,

57
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:36,420
and that made you like him. Is that it?

58
00:04:38,823 --> 00:04:39,921
I’m not sure.

59
00:04:43,832 --> 00:04:47,314
You’re not sure, yet you’re the one 
who asked him to be your boyfriend?

60
00:04:48,312 --> 00:04:49,729
What is this? I don’t get it.

61
00:04:51,847 --> 00:04:53,314
I don’t want to lose him to anyone.

62
00:04:54,108 --> 00:04:56,417
Are you saying that—

63
00:04:56,417 --> 00:04:57,198
He likes me,

64
00:04:57,809 --> 00:04:59,137
and I feel comfortable being with him.

65
00:04:59,891 --> 00:05:00,959
Isn’t that enough?

66
00:05:02,283 --> 00:05:03,718
But aren’t people in a relationship

67
00:05:04,390 --> 00:05:06,010
supposed to love each other?

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,022
Van, you prick.

69
00:05:13,468 --> 00:05:15,257
It’s Farm’s feelings we’re talking about here.

70
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:18,080
You’re treating him like he’s a toy.

71
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:20,494
You know I have no one in my life.

72
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:24,627
He came in and became my new home.

73
00:05:25,442 --> 00:05:27,363
Being with him makes me feel so warm.

74
00:05:27,913 --> 00:05:29,537
He feels like real family.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,120
So you’re using a boyfriend label 
to keep him tied to you.

76
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:38,125
Do you really not see how selfish that is?

77
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,250
I…

78
00:05:42,352 --> 00:05:44,585
I thought I’d grow to love him someday.

79
00:05:45,135 --> 00:05:46,051
Van, you asshole.

80
00:05:47,884 --> 00:05:49,518
Why are you so angry?

81
00:05:51,575 --> 00:05:53,205
Because your logic is messed up.

82
00:05:53,205 --> 00:05:54,000
Mai.

83
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,067
You knew all too well he liked you,

84
00:05:58,902 --> 00:06:01,203
and you still did this to him.

85
00:06:04,951 --> 00:06:08,673
You don’t get to use your loneliness 
as an excuse to do something wrong.

86
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,290
That excuse doesn’t even make sense.

87
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,026
Hey, don’t you think that’s too harsh?

88
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,577
All the crap you pulled with your exes, 
all we could do was lecture you.

89
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,333
But this is Farm.

90
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:20,850
You shouldn’t have done it.

91
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:25,433
And I’m telling you this straight.

92
00:06:25,922 --> 00:06:30,000
Someone like Farm wouldn’t have left you, 
even if you didn’t pull this shit.

93
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:31,674
But you did this anyway.

94
00:06:32,815 --> 00:06:34,093
Now you’re gonna lose him for real.

95
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:10,679
Why are you not sleeping?

96
00:07:12,655 --> 00:07:14,949
You have a fever. Your body’s burning up.

97
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,918
I’ll do my best to end everything.

98
00:07:24,346 --> 00:07:25,515
Just wait for me.

99
00:07:27,552 --> 00:07:29,359
I don’t know what you’re talking about.

100
00:07:30,948 --> 00:07:34,602
But I believe you can handle it.

101
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,984
Did you call to yell at me again, Mai?

102
00:08:22,984 --> 00:08:25,897
(I’m sorry. I lost my temper earlier.)

103
00:08:26,203 --> 00:08:27,752
(Where are you? I’ll come get you.)

104
00:08:28,078 --> 00:08:28,787
No need.

105
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,576
(Not the time to sulk.)

106
00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:33,019
(If you’re not staying with me, 
where are you crashing tonight?)

107
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:37,140
I’m not sulking. I’m at Farm’s.

108
00:08:37,323 --> 00:08:38,580
(Are you out of your mind?

109
00:08:38,743 --> 00:08:40,360
You’re going to get kicked out.)

110
00:08:40,747 --> 00:08:44,183
(You know how Farm gets when he’s angry.)

111
00:08:44,407 --> 00:08:45,602
He won’t do that to me.

112
00:08:45,948 --> 00:08:48,232
(Are you gonna exploit his kind heart again?)

113
00:08:48,354 --> 00:08:49,650
(Don’t even think about it, jerk.)

114
00:08:49,976 --> 00:08:51,628
Yeah, I know.

115
00:08:51,628 --> 00:08:52,870
I’ve realized how shitty my actions were.

116
00:08:53,827 --> 00:08:55,672
I came here to apologize

117
00:08:55,672 --> 00:08:57,156
and tell him the truth.

118
00:08:57,482 --> 00:08:59,008
(You came to your senses too easily.)

119
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,882
Mai, you dipshit. What do you want from me?

120
00:09:02,249 --> 00:09:04,627
(Fine. It’s good that you’ve reflected.)

121
00:09:04,912 --> 00:09:06,713
(Leave Farm out of this.)

122
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,855
(He can’t handle heartbreak. You know that.)

123
00:09:11,016 --> 00:09:11,797
Yeah.

124
00:09:12,449 --> 00:09:14,390
Thanks for 
knocking some sense into me.

125
00:09:14,858 --> 00:09:16,616
(Call me anytime.)

126
00:09:31,378 --> 00:09:32,843
PATCH THINGS UP WITH HIM.

127
00:09:32,843 --> 00:09:34,781
TELL HIM YOURSELF.

128
00:09:34,781 --> 00:09:36,483
IT’S BETTER THAN LETTING HIM 
HEAR IT FROM SOMEONE ELSE.

129
00:09:36,727 --> 00:09:38,205
HE’S SO DAMN IN LOVE WITH YOU.

130
00:09:38,388 --> 00:09:42,657
IMAGINE HOW BROKEN HE’LL BE
 IF HE FINDS OUT YOU’VE BEEN PLAYING WITH HIS FEELINGS.

131
00:09:42,922 --> 00:09:44,833
IF YOU DON’T LOVE HIM, SAY IT.

132
00:09:45,016 --> 00:09:47,977
IT’LL HURT LESS THAN 
PRETENDING YOU DO.

133
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,083
I’M HERE FOR YOU, MAN. 
JUST ONE CALL AWAY.

134
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:55,056
THANKS, DUDE.

135
00:10:17,856 --> 00:10:19,181
Can you stop smoking?

136
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,091
I need to talk to you.

137
00:10:21,946 --> 00:10:24,244
When I said I wanted our love to work out,

138
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:26,103
how did you feel after hearing it?

139
00:10:28,181 --> 00:10:29,058
Farm.

140
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,215
Did you go through my phone?

141
00:10:41,028 --> 00:10:42,555
Am I a freaking joke to you?

142
00:10:44,021 --> 00:10:45,902
You guys are so damn good.

143
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:47,415
How did you manage not to laugh?

144
00:10:48,169 --> 00:10:49,594
It’s not like that.

145
00:10:49,594 --> 00:10:52,560
I’m a complete moron 
for falling for an asshole like you.

146
00:10:53,273 --> 00:10:54,110
F*ck.

147
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,957
I’m sorry. Did I wake you?

148
00:11:28,768 --> 00:11:31,051
I didn’t hear the alarm.

149
00:11:32,273 --> 00:11:33,264
It hasn’t gone off yet.

150
00:11:38,987 --> 00:11:40,534
We still have half an hour.

151
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,547
Come up and sleep on the bed.

152
00:11:56,431 --> 00:11:58,013
Let go of my arm, maybe?

153
00:11:58,624 --> 00:12:00,357
No.

154
00:12:01,293 --> 00:12:02,081
Why not?

155
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:05,289
I’m afraid it’ll be like last night.

156
00:12:07,672 --> 00:12:08,715
Are you worried about me?

157
00:12:10,202 --> 00:12:11,200
Mm.

158
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:26,602
Do you love me?

159
00:12:27,702 --> 00:12:28,496
Mm…

160
00:12:29,351 --> 00:12:30,044
What was that?

161
00:12:30,675 --> 00:12:31,857
Yes.

162
00:12:32,506 --> 00:12:33,357
You love who?

163
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,672
I love you.

164
00:12:36,752 --> 00:12:37,551
Who?

165
00:12:39,588 --> 00:12:41,572
I love you, J.

166
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,966
Come with us, new friend.

167
00:12:58,966 --> 00:13:01,521
Is this the exact spot 
where we became friends?

168
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:02,816
J, you’re dead!

169
00:13:03,427 --> 00:13:04,368
You, move!

170
00:13:04,368 --> 00:13:04,868
Let go of my hair.

171
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:05,560
Stop!

172
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,001
Who the hell are you guys?
