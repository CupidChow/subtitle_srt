4
00:00:13,396 --> 00:00:14,981
What is ‘good love’ anyway?

5
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:17,349
Can I even be that for you?

6
00:00:17,864 --> 00:00:19,322
You wrote in your notebook:

7
00:00:19,322 --> 00:00:23,040
“I finally get it. For you, it can be
anyone in the whole world but me.”

8
00:00:23,231 --> 00:00:24,679
That’s not what I think.

9
00:00:24,755 --> 00:00:28,799
You promised me you’d forget
everything in that notebook.

10
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:29,851
I won’t forget it.

11
00:00:30,309 --> 00:00:32,029
Because it helped me
figure out my own feelings too.

12
00:00:56,671 --> 00:00:59,764
Doing something silly like this
takes me back ten years.

13
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,312
If you like it, just say so.

14
00:01:04,266 --> 00:01:05,809
I’ll take you on bike rides more often.

15
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:20,886
For us to have come this far,

16
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:23,658
we’re pretty amazing.

17
00:01:30,448 --> 00:01:31,605
You’re the amazing one.

18
00:01:36,184 --> 00:01:38,041
If you hadn’t made an effort that day,

19
00:01:39,395 --> 00:01:40,613
we wouldn’t be here now.

20
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:47,931
It was worth it, everything that I did.

21
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:51,554
Thank you.

22
00:04:21,655 --> 00:04:22,435
Asshole.

23
00:04:23,827 --> 00:04:25,535
My feelings aren’t your toys.

24
00:04:27,137 --> 00:04:27,864
Why?

25
00:04:28,512 --> 00:04:29,907
Now that you know I still like you,

26
00:04:30,365 --> 00:04:31,694
you feel victorious?

27
00:04:32,133 --> 00:04:33,981
Jinn, it’s not like that.

28
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:36,403
Fine. I lost this game.

29
00:04:38,082 --> 00:04:38,972
Are you happy now?

30
00:04:40,956 --> 00:04:42,034
Just listen first.

31
00:04:45,334 --> 00:04:46,592
Don’t you hate my guts?

32
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:48,846
We’re always in conflict.

33
00:04:49,742 --> 00:04:51,895
But today you said you had feelings for me.

34
00:04:51,895 --> 00:04:53,166
Do you think I’m stupid?

35
00:04:54,616 --> 00:04:57,059
So I need to be an asshole
in your eyes for the rest of my life?

36
00:04:58,661 --> 00:04:59,238
Yes.

37
00:05:00,421 --> 00:05:01,330
You’re a freaking asshole.

38
00:05:01,425 --> 00:05:03,597
I know you’re a boy, Jerome.

39
00:05:04,913 --> 00:05:07,545
But why can’t two males get married?

40
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:09,736
I still like you, Jerome.

41
00:05:09,736 --> 00:05:14,858
Jinn likes boys.

42
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:16,262
You might say we were just kids back then.

43
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,011
You might forget,

44
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,699
you might not have meant it,

45
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:21,273
or maybe you thought it was nothing.

46
00:05:23,486 --> 00:05:24,219
But I…

47
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:26,628
I remember every damn thing!

48
00:05:30,576 --> 00:05:33,056
Jinn, don’t be like this.

49
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:34,239
You don’t f*cking know anything.

50
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:39,107
Do you know how people at school
looked at me after that day?

51
00:05:39,202 --> 00:05:40,590
The looks they gave me?

52
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,827
I’m sorry for what I did.

53
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,680
Sorry, I didn’t remember

54
00:05:49,405 --> 00:05:51,121
or know what you had to deal with.

55
00:05:57,034 --> 00:05:59,577
You and I have to go back to how we were.

56
00:06:01,255 --> 00:06:02,421
We can’t be more than this.

57
00:06:02,516 --> 00:06:03,203
Jinn.

58
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:06,337
I’m sorry I lied when I said I hated you.

59
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:11,047
I promise I’ll make it happen.

60
00:06:11,562 --> 00:06:12,735
Jinn, it doesn’t have to be like this.

61
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,017
We’ll compete for the rest of our lives.

62
00:06:14,627 --> 00:06:15,946
You can beat me all you want.

63
00:06:16,423 --> 00:06:17,737
Steal my crushes all you want.

64
00:06:18,023 --> 00:06:19,054
You can do it all.

65
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,808
But one thing I ask—

66
00:06:23,688 --> 00:06:25,037
don’t play with my feelings.

67
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:31,813
It can’t end up like this.

68
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,447
I’LL TRY MY BEST TO HATE YOU,
I SWEAR.

69
00:08:24,886 --> 00:08:26,180
Mom, where’s Dad?

70
00:08:27,496 --> 00:08:29,453
There’s a catering order at the restaurant.

71
00:08:29,453 --> 00:08:30,590
He had to go oversee it.

72
00:08:31,983 --> 00:08:33,530
And…

73
00:08:34,884 --> 00:08:35,711
Morning, Auntie Jen.

74
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:38,772
What made you so moody?

75
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:41,174
Nothing.

76
00:08:42,566 --> 00:08:43,732
Nothing, it is.

77
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:48,158
Smile.

78
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:51,481
Yes?

79
00:08:52,892 --> 00:08:57,253
Your mom called me at dawn
and told me to prepare breakfast for you too.

80
00:08:57,425 --> 00:09:02,123
So this fake mom needs evidence
to show how well I’m taking care of you.

81
00:09:02,123 --> 00:09:03,288
Smile.

82
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,674
Cute.

83
00:09:06,323 --> 00:09:08,807
So, you two are heading to uni
together after this, right?

84
00:09:09,188 --> 00:09:11,997
And you’ll go straight back to
Jinn’s condo after class?

85
00:09:11,997 --> 00:09:12,724
- Yes.
- Auntie Jen…

86
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:16,992
What’s up, honey?

87
00:09:17,755 --> 00:09:20,354
J has been staying with me
for quite a while already.

88
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:24,217
I’d like some privacy.

89
00:09:25,152 --> 00:09:27,714
So I’m not comfortable
with him staying any longer.

90
00:09:28,954 --> 00:09:29,647
I’m sorry.

91
00:09:30,754 --> 00:09:31,580
Goodbye.

92
00:09:32,457 --> 00:09:33,543
Geez!

93
00:09:34,459 --> 00:09:36,823
Jinn, be careful, dear.

94
00:09:38,463 --> 00:09:39,093
See?

95
00:09:39,093 --> 00:09:40,378
Don’t touch it.

96
00:09:40,473 --> 00:09:42,121
Let the housemaid take care of that.

97
00:09:42,731 --> 00:09:43,779
Do you want to dress your wound first?

98
00:09:44,695 --> 00:09:46,091
It’s alright, Auntie. I should head to uni.

99
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:47,114
Goodbye.

100
00:09:51,308 --> 00:09:52,229
I’m going too, Mom.

101
00:09:52,229 --> 00:09:53,799
Be careful. Watch your step.

102
00:09:58,911 --> 00:09:59,856
Jinn, get out.

103
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:01,170
What the hell? Leave me alone.

104
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,153
Not listening, are you?

105
00:10:02,382 --> 00:10:03,071
Fine.

106
00:10:07,668 --> 00:10:09,958
Stop it. Don’t ever get in my car again.

107
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,317
You can’t stop me.

108
00:10:12,671 --> 00:10:13,846
Fine. Is this what you want?

109
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:20,805
Oh, shit!

110
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:21,811
Jinn!

111
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:27,448
Jinn!

112
00:10:31,091 --> 00:10:31,829
Jinn.

113
00:10:31,829 --> 00:10:33,058
Jinn, open your eyes.

114
00:11:00,144 --> 00:11:00,866
Jinn!

115
00:11:17,066 --> 00:11:18,106
Shit, what the hell was that?

116
00:11:28,962 --> 00:11:29,640
Are you okay?

117
00:11:30,632 --> 00:11:32,728
J, what’s going on with you?

118
00:12:16,374 --> 00:12:18,999
Good morning. Who are you trying to reach?

119
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:22,130
(Come on. Are you still sulking?)

120
00:12:22,862 --> 00:12:24,383
Did you dial the wrong number, ma’am?

121
00:12:25,189 --> 00:12:27,955
(Jinn, please. Mommy is sorry.)

122
00:12:28,376 --> 00:12:30,239
Ah, it’s you.

123
00:12:30,935 --> 00:12:33,998
What business do you have
calling me, ma’am?

124
00:12:34,108 --> 00:12:36,033
(I really can’t make it back in time,

125
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:37,978
so I asked Auntie Jen
to prepare breakfast for you too.)

126
00:12:38,326 --> 00:12:40,584
(Eat at Auntie Jen’s
before heading to uni, okay?)

127
00:12:46,162 --> 00:12:47,942
It’s fine. I can manage.

128
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:50,956
There’s plenty of food around uni.

129
00:12:50,956 --> 00:12:52,996
(It’ll take forever to get through the traffic.)

130
00:12:52,996 --> 00:12:54,077
(Then you’ll end up
skipping breakfast again.)

131
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:59,279
(I feel guilty enough for leaving
my beloved son home alone.)

132
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,253
Fine, fine, fine.

133
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:03,211
Since this is your first offense,
your punishment is reduced.

134
00:13:03,211 --> 00:13:06,045
(Aw, does that mean we’re good now?)

135
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:10,891
Transfer 20,000 to my account
and we’re completely good.

136
00:13:11,972 --> 00:13:13,858
(Don’t forget to lock
the door before you leave.)

137
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:17,368
♪ If you don’t love me,
Don’t act like you care… ♪

138
00:13:17,514 --> 00:13:18,034
Jinn.

139
00:13:23,938 --> 00:13:25,551
20,000THB HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED
TO YOUR ACCOUNT.

140
00:13:26,009 --> 00:13:26,645
Jeez!

141
00:13:31,687 --> 00:13:32,360
Thank you.

142
00:13:33,935 --> 00:13:34,673
Love you, Mom.

143
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:53,714
There’s a catering order at the restaurant.

144
00:13:53,714 --> 00:13:54,871
You can’t stop me.

145
00:14:19,868 --> 00:14:20,722
Oh, there you are.

146
00:14:21,729 --> 00:14:23,661
There’s a catering order at the restaurant.

147
00:14:23,661 --> 00:14:24,840
Dad had to go oversee it.

148
00:14:39,452 --> 00:14:40,381
Morning, Auntie Jen.

149
00:14:41,553 --> 00:14:43,099
What made you so moody?

150
00:14:44,253 --> 00:14:44,800
Nothing.

151
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:46,731
Nothing, it is.

152
00:14:49,295 --> 00:14:51,081
Hey, son.

153
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:53,023
Why are you just standing there?

154
00:14:53,371 --> 00:14:54,702
Eat, so you can go to class.

155
00:15:00,132 --> 00:15:02,311
Smile.

156
00:15:03,776 --> 00:15:04,438
Yes?

157
00:15:05,445 --> 00:15:08,200
Your mom called me at dawn

158
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,330
and told me to prepare breakfast for you too.

159
00:15:10,678 --> 00:15:15,005
So this fake mom needs evidence
to show how well I’m taking care of you.

160
00:15:15,005 --> 00:15:16,206
Smile.

161
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:18,834
Cute.

162
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,378
So you two are heading to uni
together after this, right?

163
00:15:21,543 --> 00:15:23,638
And you’ll go straight back to Jinn’s—

164
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:25,011
Let’s get going before we’re late.

165
00:15:26,036 --> 00:15:26,791
Let go.

166
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,465
I said let’s go.

167
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:29,259
J.

168
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:30,762
- Let go!
- Gosh!

169
00:15:36,575 --> 00:15:37,176
Watch it.

170
00:15:37,597 --> 00:15:38,288
Ow.

171
00:15:39,359 --> 00:15:40,049
Does it hurt?

172
00:15:40,653 --> 00:15:41,218
F*ck off.

173
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,114
What just happened, dear?

174
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:48,995
Smile.

175
00:15:51,046 --> 00:15:51,632
Gosh!

176
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:54,275
Ow.

177
00:15:54,752 --> 00:15:55,438
You can’t stop me.

178
00:15:58,038 --> 00:15:59,134
I have to go help Jinn.

179
00:16:00,011 --> 00:16:00,547
Hey.

180
00:16:06,269 --> 00:16:07,449
Where are you rushing to? Hell?

181
00:16:10,691 --> 00:16:11,276
Damn it.

182
00:16:18,068 --> 00:16:19,429
Jinn, get out now.

183
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:21,789
Get out.

184
00:16:21,935 --> 00:16:23,179
What the hell? Move!

185
00:16:23,179 --> 00:16:23,914
Get out.

186
00:16:24,225 --> 00:16:25,147
Out of the car.

187
00:16:25,403 --> 00:16:26,275
Not getting out?

188
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:28,864
What the f*ck is wrong with you?

189
00:16:30,219 --> 00:16:31,002
Listen to me.

190
00:16:32,247 --> 00:16:33,963
You can’t go anywhere today, Jinn.

191
00:16:35,812 --> 00:16:36,783
Why can’t I?

192
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:44,000
Jinn!

193
00:17:08,943 --> 00:17:09,640
Are you alright?

194
00:17:10,409 --> 00:17:11,089
Are you hurt?

195
00:17:12,993 --> 00:17:13,937
No, I’m fine.

196
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,591
J, are you alright?

197
00:17:23,594 --> 00:17:24,329
(Jinn!)

198
00:17:25,904 --> 00:17:26,901
Jinn, open your eyes.

199
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:27,999
(Jinn. Jinn.)

200
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:28,626
Hey!

201
00:17:32,471 --> 00:17:33,102
What’s going on with you?

202
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,807
It’s good you’re safe.

203
00:17:43,767 --> 00:17:44,337
J.

204
00:17:45,893 --> 00:17:46,647
(Jinn.)

205
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:52,114
(Jinn, please be alright.)

206
00:17:52,407 --> 00:17:52,907
J.

207
00:17:53,571 --> 00:17:54,213
J.

208
00:17:54,571 --> 00:17:55,203
J.

209
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:56,179
J, are you okay?

210
00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:57,948
(Jinn, can you hear me?)

211
00:17:58,058 --> 00:17:58,756
J.

212
00:17:59,104 --> 00:17:59,936
J, can you hear me?

213
00:18:04,261 --> 00:18:04,935
J!

214
00:18:10,978 --> 00:18:12,189
He fainted?

215
00:18:12,628 --> 00:18:13,392
(Yes.)

216
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:14,293
(He’s still out.)

217
00:18:15,996 --> 00:18:16,750
What happened?

218
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:19,955
Our drapings are being graded today.

219
00:18:20,486 --> 00:18:21,756
I know. I remember that.

220
00:18:22,049 --> 00:18:24,104
(If you hurry now, you can still
slip in at the end of the line.)

221
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,756
As for J, I’ll talk to the professor.

222
00:18:27,122 --> 00:18:28,483
He’s sick. The professor should understand.

223
00:18:28,611 --> 00:18:29,356
Alright.

224
00:18:29,356 --> 00:18:30,759
Once he wakes up, I’ll go.

225
00:18:34,788 --> 00:18:35,606
Auntie Jen,

226
00:18:36,668 --> 00:18:37,690
should we take him to the hospital?

227
00:18:38,423 --> 00:18:39,761
You have class, right?

228
00:18:39,761 --> 00:18:41,099
Go on. I’ll take it from here.

229
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:42,884
Okay.

230
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,647
If anything happens, call me anytime.

231
00:18:46,507 --> 00:18:47,234
You should get going.

232
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:48,734
Goodbye.

233
00:18:51,682 --> 00:18:52,355
Jinn.

234
00:18:53,454 --> 00:18:54,788
Mom, you can’t let him go.

235
00:18:55,136 --> 00:18:55,875
It’s dangerous.

236
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:58,791
What’s dangerous? It’s nothing.

237
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:00,790
You should worry about yourself.

238
00:19:01,468 --> 00:19:03,222
Do you want to get a medical check-up?

239
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:18,008
J, JINN SAID YOU FAINTED. YOU OK?

240
00:19:18,667 --> 00:19:19,750
IS JINN THERE YET?

241
00:19:22,716 --> 00:19:24,493
NO. HOW ARE YOU?

242
00:19:24,859 --> 00:19:26,885
ONCE HE GETS THERE, LET ME KNOW.

243
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:27,735
Jeez.

244
00:19:29,823 --> 00:19:30,711
JINN’S HERE.

245
00:19:32,414 --> 00:19:33,889
You almost missed it.

246
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:35,990
Right. I drove as fast as I could.

247
00:19:36,741 --> 00:19:38,135
IS HE SAFE?

248
00:19:48,558 --> 00:19:49,590
HE SEEMS PERFECTLY FINE.

249
00:19:53,106 --> 00:19:53,985
What’s up?

250
00:19:54,205 --> 00:19:54,847
Nothing.

251
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:56,388
How’s J?

252
00:19:56,681 --> 00:19:58,223
Right. Is he okay?

253
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,627
He’d already woken up when I left.

254
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,031
Is he, like, sick?

255
00:20:04,361 --> 00:20:05,960
I’ve never seen him sick before.

256
00:20:06,912 --> 00:20:07,707
I don’t know.

257
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,565
He was doing fine last night.

258
00:20:09,766 --> 00:20:11,760
He seemed alright when we had breakfast.

259
00:20:12,529 --> 00:20:13,809
But suddenly he’s just…

260
00:20:14,926 --> 00:20:16,803
You can’t go anywhere today, Jinn.

261
00:20:20,011 --> 00:20:20,680
J!

262
00:20:23,091 --> 00:20:23,856
You blanked out.

263
00:20:25,522 --> 00:20:26,271
What’s the matter?

264
00:20:29,219 --> 00:20:29,897
I think…

265
00:20:30,849 --> 00:20:32,738
ever since the accident at Tar’s racetrack,

266
00:20:33,928 --> 00:20:35,129
J’s been acting weird.

267
00:20:58,838 --> 00:20:59,630
My dear.

268
00:20:59,938 --> 00:21:01,919
Since we’re already here to remove the cast,

269
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,647
why don’t you get a full check-up too?

270
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:09,486
Come on.

271
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:16,772
So?

272
00:21:17,321 --> 00:21:18,321
What did the doctor say?

273
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,057
I still can’t carry heavy things.

274
00:21:21,313 --> 00:21:22,480
The rest is fine.

275
00:21:24,787 --> 00:21:25,529
That’s good.

276
00:21:30,657 --> 00:21:31,426
What is it?

277
00:21:31,847 --> 00:21:33,098
Do you still have a headache?

278
00:21:34,069 --> 00:21:36,164
But didn’t the doctor say you were fine?

279
00:21:36,164 --> 00:21:37,454
Hm? Let me see.

280
00:21:42,728 --> 00:21:44,551
You’ve recovered now,
so you’re good to come home, right?

281
00:21:46,584 --> 00:21:49,266
But we need to have a mutual understanding

282
00:21:49,522 --> 00:21:52,905
that even if you’re home, I still don’t
feel comfortable with you driving—-

283
00:21:52,905 --> 00:21:53,594
Mom.

284
00:21:56,029 --> 00:21:57,919
Will you drop me off at Jinn’s, please?

285
00:21:58,852 --> 00:21:59,464
Hm?

286
00:22:01,423 --> 00:22:02,502
I’ll continue staying with him.

287
00:22:13,446 --> 00:22:14,773
Mediocre looks.

288
00:22:15,451 --> 00:22:16,747
Obnoxious behavior.

289
00:22:17,205 --> 00:22:18,594
What’s there to like?

290
00:22:34,141 --> 00:22:38,428
Maybe I missed it because we were always
getting under each other’s skin before.

291
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:40,824
But now that I’m with him all the time,

292
00:22:41,137 --> 00:22:42,554
I feel like…

293
00:22:43,356 --> 00:22:45,062
he’s, surprisingly, a good person.

294
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:51,925
- Aw.
- Aw.

295
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:55,282
Don’t tell me you’ve already fallen for him.

296
00:22:55,921 --> 00:22:58,484
So in the end, you lost to
his hotness like everyone else.

297
00:22:58,484 --> 00:23:00,129
It’s not that! That’s not true!

298
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:02,474
There are five of us in this group.

299
00:23:02,474 --> 00:23:03,768
Four are dating each other.

300
00:23:03,768 --> 00:23:05,407
And I’m the leftover side dish. Damn it.

301
00:23:05,642 --> 00:23:06,364
Mai!

302
00:23:06,814 --> 00:23:10,094
Sorry, I was just talking nonsense.

303
00:23:11,562 --> 00:23:13,830
There’s one more weird thing.

304
00:23:14,124 --> 00:23:14,710
What?

305
00:23:15,884 --> 00:23:18,282
J keeps waking up at night
because of bad dreams.

306
00:23:18,713 --> 00:23:20,228
Sometimes he just sits up.

307
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:22,801
Sometimes he tosses around
then falls asleep again.

308
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:23,888
Maybe he’s a sleep talker?

309
00:23:23,888 --> 00:23:25,130
Lots of people do that.

310
00:23:25,658 --> 00:23:27,004
Every time I dream…

311
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,626
there’s always this one person in it,

312
00:23:29,841 --> 00:23:31,764
just in different situations.

313
00:23:31,764 --> 00:23:33,294
Everything always comes true.

314
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,961
Hey, Farm.

315
00:23:35,961 --> 00:23:36,461
Hm?

316
00:23:36,676 --> 00:23:37,964
You’re the closest to J.

317
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:40,733
Did he tell you anything?

318
00:23:41,144 --> 00:23:43,236
No. He didn’t say a word.

319
00:23:43,725 --> 00:23:44,838
Not even a little bit?

320
00:23:44,838 --> 00:23:45,338
Right.

321
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:50,324
When his car crashed,

322
00:23:51,322 --> 00:23:53,331
you were the one closest to him, Jinn.

323
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:57,416
Shouldn’t you be the one
who noticed if anything was weird?

324
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:03,290
And besides the unusual sleeping stuff,
is there anything else weird that he does?

325
00:24:04,973 --> 00:24:07,112
Anything weird?

326
00:24:17,505 --> 00:24:18,740
Don’t tell me…

327
00:24:19,171 --> 00:24:20,842
That you and he…

328
00:24:22,936 --> 00:24:23,927
Hit each other.

329
00:24:24,318 --> 00:24:25,323
Did he hit you?

330
00:24:25,323 --> 00:24:26,279
Did you hit each other?

331
00:24:26,514 --> 00:24:27,235
Guys, stop.

332
00:24:28,722 --> 00:24:29,706
Did you guys kiss?

333
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:35,701
Yeah?

334
00:24:37,815 --> 00:24:38,957
Yes, we hit each other.

335
00:24:39,427 --> 00:24:40,773
We had a fistfight.

336
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:46,871
The ones who kissed were you guys.

337
00:24:46,871 --> 00:24:48,042
Mai!

338
00:24:48,042 --> 00:24:49,260
Hey, what?

339
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,317
I’m just coughing.

340
00:25:10,499 --> 00:25:11,057
What?

341
00:25:11,957 --> 00:25:13,426
I’m just trying to be a slightly better person.

342
00:25:13,426 --> 00:25:14,807
You act like you’ve seen a ghost.

343
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,144
You don’t have to force it.

344
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,791
You can just be yourself.

345
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:25,027
I’m not forcing anything.

346
00:25:25,438 --> 00:25:27,169
I’m just adjusting.

347
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:28,537
Why are you adjusting?

348
00:25:31,062 --> 00:25:36,365
Can’t I try to be a better person for once, sir?

349
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,804
I’m going to use the bathroom.

350
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:32,479
You came to pack your things?

351
00:26:54,022 --> 00:26:55,170
Isn’t your hand fully healed?

352
00:26:57,714 --> 00:26:58,474
No.

353
00:27:00,353 --> 00:27:01,667
I can see that it’s healed.

354
00:27:03,918 --> 00:27:04,985
I said it’s not healed.

355
00:27:06,003 --> 00:27:07,634
Stop screwing with me, J.

356
00:27:14,234 --> 00:27:15,221
What the hell are you doing, J?

357
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:25,626
I said it’s not yet healed.

358
00:28:07,784 --> 00:28:08,459
Jinn!

359
00:28:22,855 --> 00:28:23,833
Are you gonna toss and turn all night?

360
00:28:23,833 --> 00:28:24,541
I can’t sleep.

361
00:28:34,511 --> 00:28:35,369
What a sulky baby.

362
00:29:27,677 --> 00:29:29,085
Drinking coffee at this hour?

363
00:29:54,861 --> 00:29:56,545
You can even mess with me in your sleep.

364
00:29:57,641 --> 00:29:59,024
It’s just in your nature.

365
00:30:07,921 --> 00:30:09,336
Mediocre looks.

366
00:30:10,471 --> 00:30:11,727
Not even handsome.

367
00:30:13,038 --> 00:30:14,176
Obnoxious behavior.

368
00:30:15,683 --> 00:30:17,209
What’s there to like?

369
00:30:45,666 --> 00:30:46,347
J?

370
00:30:55,825 --> 00:30:57,164
Is it happening again?

371
00:31:02,252 --> 00:31:03,348
It’s just a nightmare.

372
00:31:09,028 --> 00:31:09,770
Easy.

373
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:12,791
It’s okay.

374
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:15,963
Go back to sleep.

375
00:31:43,238 --> 00:31:44,461
ALARM

376
00:32:06,796 --> 00:32:07,485
Van.

377
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:09,924
I need to go shower.

378
00:34:14,445 --> 00:34:15,934
If the future hadn’t shown me,

379
00:34:17,324 --> 00:34:19,070
I’d never know that…

380
00:34:20,753 --> 00:34:22,404
you’re this cute.

381
00:34:30,898 --> 00:34:33,853
So what happens to you and me
ten years from now?

382
00:34:34,107 --> 00:34:35,118
Tell me already.

383
00:34:36,234 --> 00:34:37,183
We’re boyfriends.

384
00:34:49,864 --> 00:34:52,494
Gosh, I’m freaking sleepy.

385
00:34:53,254 --> 00:34:55,312
Class hasn’t even started yet,
and you’re already sleepy?

386
00:34:55,682 --> 00:34:57,552
I just hate morning classes.

387
00:34:58,107 --> 00:34:58,696
Hey.

388
00:34:59,641 --> 00:35:00,519
You’re fully recovered?

389
00:35:01,068 --> 00:35:02,246
I’m better now.

390
00:35:02,739 --> 00:35:04,253
Hey, your cast is off.

391
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,830
Does it mean you can go home?

392
00:35:16,511 --> 00:35:17,156
Farm.

393
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:18,416
Yeah?

394
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,535
Will you go to the bathroom with me?

395
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,042
I’m coming too.

396
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:28,542
Hey,

397
00:35:29,056 --> 00:35:31,294
if we don’t get back
before roll call, cover for us.

398
00:35:33,348 --> 00:35:34,884
Yeah, sure.

399
00:35:37,472 --> 00:35:38,618
Hey, Jinn.

400
00:35:39,316 --> 00:35:40,704
Will you come sit next to me?

401
00:35:42,388 --> 00:35:43,763
I’m literally right in front of you.

402
00:35:43,763 --> 00:35:44,879
Why would I move next to you?

403
00:35:46,522 --> 00:35:48,920
I just want someone beside me.

404
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,923
Oh, yeah?

405
00:35:49,923 --> 00:35:51,617
Someone beside you?

406
00:35:52,788 --> 00:35:53,813
Go sit with your dad.

407
00:36:01,063 --> 00:36:01,774
What’s wrong?

408
00:36:08,153 --> 00:36:09,154
It’s still going on.

409
00:36:18,274 --> 00:36:19,047
I’m off.

410
00:36:19,191 --> 00:36:20,426
Right. See you later.

411
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,354
You two took the entire class period
just to use the bathroom.

412
00:36:30,628 --> 00:36:33,006
Next time, if you want to skip, invite me too.

413
00:36:33,129 --> 00:36:34,039
I’m lonely.

414
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:35,930
Here.

415
00:36:38,005 --> 00:36:40,711
Yeah, we just got carried away talking.

416
00:36:42,272 --> 00:36:43,616
Where’s Jinn?

417
00:36:44,314 --> 00:36:45,026
He left.

418
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:46,770
What? What about me?

419
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:47,516
He said you were not leaving together.

420
00:36:47,516 --> 00:36:49,102
My ass!

421
00:36:49,102 --> 00:36:50,557
He just walked off. If you—

422
00:36:54,388 --> 00:36:55,083
Great.

423
00:37:01,738 --> 00:37:03,005
Let’s grab something to eat

424
00:37:03,970 --> 00:37:05,729
so you’ll stop complaining.

425
00:37:06,388 --> 00:37:08,468
Fine. Whatever.

426
00:37:09,166 --> 00:37:10,455
Anyone can just leave me behind.

427
00:37:11,995 --> 00:37:13,194
Except you.

428
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:17,197
You, shut up.

429
00:37:17,608 --> 00:37:19,199
And walk.

430
00:37:23,163 --> 00:37:24,669
Jinn, open the door now.

431
00:37:24,908 --> 00:37:26,022
Jinn, open the door.

432
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,183
Isn’t your hand already healed?

433
00:37:32,779 --> 00:37:35,007
There’s no reason for me
to be your chauffeur.

434
00:37:35,274 --> 00:37:35,886
Jinn.

435
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:39,633
Bye-bye.

436
00:37:46,686 --> 00:37:47,560
Don’t.

437
00:37:48,217 --> 00:37:49,152
Go to work already.

438
00:37:51,062 --> 00:37:52,249
Fine, I’m going.

439
00:37:52,588 --> 00:37:53,287
Bye-bye.

440
00:37:59,759 --> 00:38:00,565
J!

441
00:38:00,853 --> 00:38:01,530
I’m off now.

442
00:38:29,276 --> 00:38:31,032
AUNTIE JENNY

443
00:38:34,155 --> 00:38:35,158
Hello, Auntie Jen.

444
00:38:36,062 --> 00:38:38,758
I got home and found
that J and his car were gone.

445
00:38:38,922 --> 00:38:40,541
And I can’t reach him.

446
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:42,468
(Is he with you, Jinn?)

447
00:38:43,598 --> 00:38:44,555
He’s not.

448
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:50,689
Damn it, J.

449
00:38:50,689 --> 00:38:51,461
What the hell are you playing now?

450
00:38:55,339 --> 00:38:56,203
TAR

451
00:38:56,737 --> 00:38:57,566
Hello, Tar.

452
00:38:59,127 --> 00:39:00,202
Yes. Sure.

453
00:39:04,022 --> 00:39:07,203
When was the first time
you saw those visions?

454
00:39:08,004 --> 00:39:10,780
I’d been seeing them vaguely
in my dreams for a while.

455
00:39:12,388 --> 00:39:14,366
But I saw them clearly for the first time…

456
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,363
when I crashed the car.

457
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:22,150
Are you saying you lost control
of the car because of this?

458
00:39:23,752 --> 00:39:24,892
I can’t explain it.

459
00:39:26,638 --> 00:39:31,775
It felt like I was pulled into it,
and I forgot I was even driving.

460
00:39:32,412 --> 00:39:33,740
The next thing I knew,

461
00:39:34,603 --> 00:39:36,112
the car had already crashed.

462
00:39:38,967 --> 00:39:42,238
But you usually only see
these visions when you’re asleep.

463
00:39:43,388 --> 00:39:45,880
So, at the circuit…

464
00:39:47,174 --> 00:39:51,106
That was the first time you saw
something while you were awake.

465
00:39:54,388 --> 00:39:55,834
I’ve never thought about that.

466
00:40:05,665 --> 00:40:08,244
You say you hate him the most,
yet you’re the first to come, Jinn.

467
00:40:10,504 --> 00:40:11,904
How could you let him drive?

468
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,478
His hand isn’t even fully healed.

469
00:40:15,053 --> 00:40:17,213
My guy called, saying
someone trespassed on my circuit.

470
00:40:17,213 --> 00:40:19,219
When I got here,
he was already losing it like this.

471
00:40:22,391 --> 00:40:23,248
Where are you going, Jinn?

472
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:25,497
To stop him.

473
00:40:59,272 --> 00:40:59,984
J!

474
00:41:00,806 --> 00:41:01,676
Asshole!

475
00:41:03,108 --> 00:41:03,789
Jinn?

476
00:41:14,183 --> 00:41:16,249
You bastard. Get out of the car.

477
00:41:16,249 --> 00:41:17,194
Hey, asshole.

478
00:41:17,379 --> 00:41:18,476
I said get out of the car.

479
00:41:18,743 --> 00:41:20,795
Open the door, asshole!

480
00:41:23,588 --> 00:41:24,513
What the f*ck is wrong with you?

481
00:41:24,513 --> 00:41:26,011
Tell me. What the f*ck is going on with you?

482
00:41:26,011 --> 00:41:27,155
I don’t want to be like this anymore!

483
00:41:33,328 --> 00:41:34,894
I don’t want to be like this anymore.

484
00:41:35,387 --> 00:41:36,886
I don’t want to be like this anymore.

485
00:41:45,267 --> 00:41:47,421
I don’t want to be like this anymore, Jinn.

486
00:41:50,112 --> 00:41:52,445
I want it to stop. I don’t want to be like this.

487
00:41:53,924 --> 00:41:56,021
I don’t want to be like this anymore, Jinn.

488
00:41:57,171 --> 00:41:58,741
I don’t want to be like this anymore.

489
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,049
I’m done. I don’t want it.

490
00:42:06,527 --> 00:42:07,822
It’s okay, J.

491
00:42:08,228 --> 00:42:09,854
I really don’t want to be like this anymore.

492
00:42:12,881 --> 00:42:13,795
It’s alright.

493
00:42:30,301 --> 00:42:33,495
So when I see you having nightmares
and waking up at night all the time,

494
00:42:35,878 --> 00:42:37,397
you’re actually…

495
00:42:49,649 --> 00:42:51,223
I know it’s hard to believe.

496
00:42:52,455 --> 00:42:53,702
But I’ve proved everything.

497
00:42:55,961 --> 00:42:56,831
Proved how?

498
00:42:58,988 --> 00:43:02,558
I know exactly how you take your coffee,
down to every spoon.

499
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:08,351
I know you love strawberry ice cream
even though you try so hard to hide it.

500
00:43:10,426 --> 00:43:15,362
I knew your notebook was in
your underwear drawer because…

501
00:43:15,978 --> 00:43:16,975
I dreamed about it.

502
00:43:25,994 --> 00:43:27,033
So, that means…

503
00:43:28,718 --> 00:43:30,751
yesterday, you knew I was going to
get hit by that bike?

504
00:43:32,887 --> 00:43:36,760
Normally, the visions I see
are way in the future.

505
00:43:37,889 --> 00:43:39,424
It’s rare to see something this near.

506
00:43:46,654 --> 00:43:49,377
Is this why you seem more mature?

507
00:43:51,534 --> 00:43:52,823
You think so?

508
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:54,919
Why?

509
00:43:57,322 --> 00:43:59,489
There are moments
when you’re steadier than me,

510
00:43:59,982 --> 00:44:01,131
calmer than me.

511
00:44:02,938 --> 00:44:04,694
Sometimes you just ignore me
when I try to pick a fight.

512
00:44:06,502 --> 00:44:08,974
If it were before, we’d be
beating each other up already.

513
00:44:10,104 --> 00:44:11,376
There’s no way we could’ve lived together.

514
00:44:14,642 --> 00:44:15,831
I didn’t realize that.

515
00:44:16,858 --> 00:44:18,022
How could you?

516
00:44:18,885 --> 00:44:22,913
You then and you now are still you.

517
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:31,880
So what other visions
do you see far in the future?

518
00:44:40,222 --> 00:44:41,250
I see…

519
00:44:43,139 --> 00:44:47,071
our future, ten years from now.

520
00:44:49,793 --> 00:44:50,536
Our?

521
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:58,301
When I said that the notebook helped me
realize my feelings, I wasn’t joking.

522
00:44:59,082 --> 00:45:00,847
In my dreams, I see myself,

523
00:45:01,237 --> 00:45:02,830
so I understand how I feel.

524
00:45:04,412 --> 00:45:08,547
But when I read your feelings
from the notebook, I realized…

525
00:45:10,683 --> 00:45:12,190
how much I’d been overlooking.

526
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:19,014
So what happens to you and me
ten years from now?

527
00:45:20,575 --> 00:45:21,677
Tell me already.

528
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:26,081
We’re boyfriends.

529
00:45:26,677 --> 00:45:27,282
Huh?

530
00:45:33,676 --> 00:45:34,698
We hug.

531
00:46:09,913 --> 00:46:10,736
We kiss.

532
00:46:13,529 --> 00:46:14,680
You and I love each other.

533
00:46:15,378 --> 00:46:16,123
J.

534
00:46:16,123 --> 00:46:17,561
We do love each other.

535
00:46:31,733 --> 00:46:33,411
So, what do we do now?

536
00:46:33,904 --> 00:46:34,910
What the heck are we waiting for?

537
00:46:35,177 --> 00:46:36,101
We’re boyfriends, of course.

538
00:46:37,498 --> 00:46:38,625
I can’t sleep.

539
00:46:38,748 --> 00:46:40,652
I want to cuddle my boyfriend.

540
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:42,846
I’m gonna put this on the table, Mom.

541
00:46:42,846 --> 00:46:43,362
Sure.

542
00:46:46,792 --> 00:46:48,255
How long are you going to keep doing this?

543
00:46:48,388 --> 00:46:51,491
Until someone comes along to
take care of you in my place, I guess.

544
00:46:52,230 --> 00:46:53,814
Don’t you want to take care of me forever?

545
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,601
What if everything that’s happened
is just a coincidence?

546
00:46:58,683 --> 00:47:03,388
Well, at least my feelings turned out real.
