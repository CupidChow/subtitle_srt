4
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,386
It’s been five years.

5
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:16,936
Time really flies.

6
00:00:17,423 --> 00:00:18,578
Don’t worry about him.

7
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:20,960
He might live a stupid life sometimes, but…

8
00:00:21,346 --> 00:00:22,272
I’ll help take care of him.

9
00:00:26,229 --> 00:00:26,859
Are you throwing it away?

10
00:00:27,326 --> 00:00:29,393
Can I write on the other half?

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,734
What? What are you gonna write?

12
00:00:36,544 --> 00:00:37,783
My love for you.

13
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:46,098
Your medication, sir.

14
00:00:55,181 --> 00:00:56,454
All I’ve got are sleeping pills.

15
00:00:56,982 --> 00:00:58,042
I told you.

16
00:01:00,782 --> 00:01:01,589
Should we try another hospital?

17
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,036
Doctors here suck.

18
00:01:05,294 --> 00:01:06,271
Jinn, keep your voice down.

19
00:01:07,773 --> 00:01:08,367
Why?

20
00:01:08,509 --> 00:01:11,379
If they can’t cure you, then they suck.

21
00:01:12,515 --> 00:01:14,161
Stop frowning.

22
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:16,087
I see the future.

23
00:01:16,371 --> 00:01:17,897
It’s not like I have cataracts.

24
00:01:19,115 --> 00:01:20,123
You can still crack jokes, huh?

25
00:01:21,442 --> 00:01:23,091
I only came to the hospital for you.

26
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:27,318
Now relax. Nothing’s wrong.

27
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:28,913
I’m perfectly fine.

28
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:29,843
Okay?

29
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:32,983
Mm.

30
00:01:35,276 --> 00:01:35,919
How about this?

31
00:01:36,853 --> 00:01:41,564
Just think of it like
you’ve got a superhero boyfriend.

32
00:01:42,701 --> 00:01:45,603
Someone with a superpower to protect you.

33
00:01:46,334 --> 00:01:47,405
That should help, right?

34
00:01:52,864 --> 00:01:53,833
What are you spouting now?

35
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,174
Damn.

36
00:01:57,244 --> 00:01:58,560
I am so freaking cool.

37
00:01:59,899 --> 00:02:01,476
Sure, cool guy.

38
00:03:41,842 --> 00:03:42,477
Three.

39
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,272
Two.

40
00:03:43,516 --> 00:03:44,241
- One.
- One.

41
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,089
J!

42
00:03:55,089 --> 00:03:56,041
Argh.

43
00:03:57,928 --> 00:03:58,864
Don’t let go of me.

44
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:00,209
No, you let go! J!

45
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,523
I’ll show you something.

46
00:04:09,327 --> 00:04:10,199
Knock it off.

47
00:04:22,024 --> 00:04:23,700
Why did you bring me here to swim?

48
00:04:24,654 --> 00:04:29,417
Don’t you like bathing or
going to the beach when you’re stressed?

49
00:04:30,391 --> 00:04:31,582
This will do for today.

50
00:04:32,637 --> 00:04:34,641
I’ll take you to a beach next time.

51
00:04:36,204 --> 00:04:39,524
How do you know I like
being in the water when I’m stressed?

52
00:04:40,701 --> 00:04:44,080
Besides my mom, I’ve never told anyone.

53
00:04:48,382 --> 00:04:49,033
Well?

54
00:04:50,007 --> 00:04:51,969
I… don’t know.

55
00:04:52,903 --> 00:04:54,412
I just happen to know.

56
00:04:56,847 --> 00:05:02,366
So that means, apart from seeing the future,
you’ve got future memories as well?

57
00:05:20,473 --> 00:05:21,800
I feel like it’s a shame.

58
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:24,838
A shame about what?

59
00:05:27,456 --> 00:05:28,998
Our relationship.

60
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:34,392
How did you like me?

61
00:05:34,818 --> 00:05:36,126
When did we fall in love?

62
00:05:37,506 --> 00:05:39,239
What did we like about each other?

63
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,435
We don’t have those memories yet.

64
00:05:46,444 --> 00:05:48,401
Are you bothered by that?

65
00:05:48,746 --> 00:05:50,141
Not that much.

66
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:53,652
Just a little down about it.

67
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:57,418
I don’t even know what you like or don’t like.

68
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,830
You’ll learn it as we live together.

69
00:06:03,859 --> 00:06:04,477
Mm.

70
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:08,979
If I dream about all that,

71
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:12,975
you’ll be the first to know.

72
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:13,827
Okay?

73
00:06:16,973 --> 00:06:19,426
But that’s not the same as
remembering it myself.

74
00:06:20,623 --> 00:06:21,833
We hated each other’s guts,

75
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,525
and all of a sudden, we became boyfriends.

76
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,728
Who wouldn’t be confused?

77
00:06:36,945 --> 00:06:38,852
If it weren’t for your dreams,

78
00:06:39,562 --> 00:06:40,938
I can’t imagine how…

79
00:06:42,176 --> 00:06:46,258
we’d end up together.

80
00:06:49,119 --> 00:06:50,762
We’d end up together one way or another.

81
00:06:55,775 --> 00:06:58,837
I might’ve already died
when I got hit by that bike.

82
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,113
Jinn!

83
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,638
If someone’s destined to die…

84
00:07:08,282 --> 00:07:09,624
they die.

85
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:19,954
Didn’t I tell you not to talk about death?

86
00:07:24,957 --> 00:07:25,647
Right.

87
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:27,563
I’m sorry.

88
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:31,282
I was just being foul-mouthed.

89
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:36,837
Don’t overthink it.

90
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:44,411
J!

91
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,493
Blood.

92
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:05,728
I’m okay now.

93
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,900
Stop making that worried face.

94
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:10,087
Sure you don’t want to go to the hospital?

95
00:08:15,018 --> 00:08:18,946
If we go, it’ll be for your brain check.

96
00:08:19,636 --> 00:08:21,036
We were literally just there this morning.

97
00:08:21,137 --> 00:08:22,116
Remember?

98
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:23,838
Well, you suddenly started bleeding.

99
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,207
Am I wrong for panicking?

100
00:08:26,587 --> 00:08:27,900
It’s just a nosebleed.

101
00:08:28,042 --> 00:08:29,704
Kindergarten kids get them all the time.

102
00:08:31,652 --> 00:08:32,991
Are you sure you’re okay?

103
00:08:32,991 --> 00:08:35,530
Any headache? Any symptoms?

104
00:08:36,991 --> 00:08:39,443
Actually… I do feel something.

105
00:08:41,249 --> 00:08:42,624
What is it, J? Tell me now.

106
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:44,239
Are you alright, J?

107
00:08:44,401 --> 00:08:45,088
J!

108
00:08:48,497 --> 00:08:49,633
I feel like I’m your boyfriend.

109
00:08:51,196 --> 00:08:52,716
J, what are you playing?

110
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,109
How are you this cute?

111
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:09,174
Idiot.

112
00:09:10,473 --> 00:09:13,504
Stop saying stuff like that. I’m going to puke.

113
00:09:14,275 --> 00:09:15,814
Just admit you’re blushing.

114
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:20,159
Your ears are bright red.

115
00:09:30,981 --> 00:09:33,495
You said it felt like a shame
about our relationship.

116
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,064
So, from now on,

117
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,194
I’ll focus on the present as much as I can.

118
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:42,733
Can you even do that?

119
00:09:43,626 --> 00:09:45,955
Can you tell your feelings apart?

120
00:09:46,746 --> 00:09:49,489
You still mix up the present and the future.

121
00:09:53,527 --> 00:09:55,981
Even though I already know I love you,

122
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,603
we’re going to start
getting to know each other all over again.

123
00:10:03,348 --> 00:10:04,339
What do you mean?

124
00:10:05,293 --> 00:10:10,499
Even though I know you’ve been
in love with me since you could walk—

125
00:10:11,757 --> 00:10:12,454
Not true.

126
00:10:13,103 --> 00:10:15,413
—I’m still going to hit on you.

127
00:10:16,285 --> 00:10:19,218
Make you fall for me even more.

128
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,436
I’m going to make you
head over heels for me.

129
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,128
Sounds good?

130
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:52,018
Thanks for coming with me
to visit my parents.

131
00:10:53,297 --> 00:10:54,002
Mm.

132
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:04,390
Why are you being so cold?

133
00:11:07,576 --> 00:11:11,103
Then how am I supposed to act
so I don’t seem cold?

134
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:14,612
You’re not supposed to act anything.

135
00:11:15,485 --> 00:11:16,986
Just being you is enough.

136
00:11:20,395 --> 00:11:21,646
What’s up with you?

137
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:28,683
Ever since my parents passed, you’re the
only one who’s cared about me this much.

138
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:31,411
What’s going on here?

139
00:11:32,263 --> 00:11:33,258
Would you be my boyfriend?

140
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,121
I don’t want to lose you to anyone.

141
00:11:45,257 --> 00:11:46,836
I want to have you like this—

142
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:19,083
Have you always known I like you?

143
00:12:20,801 --> 00:12:22,352
Do I even have any good traits?

144
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,045
I don’t get what you like about me.

145
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:27,241
Because you’re bad.

146
00:12:28,053 --> 00:12:29,657
I have to keep you in check.

147
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,151
Hey, jerk!

148
00:12:31,395 --> 00:12:33,053
That was a smooth insult.

149
00:12:37,213 --> 00:12:40,614
But you’re being serious, right?

150
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:43,373
Yes or no?

151
00:12:44,976 --> 00:12:45,610
Mm.

152
00:12:59,538 --> 00:13:01,751
What the heck are you doing, J?

153
00:13:02,542 --> 00:13:03,235
Courting you.

154
00:13:34,044 --> 00:13:36,160
What the heck are you doing, J?

155
00:13:38,216 --> 00:13:38,925
Courting you.

156
00:13:41,103 --> 00:13:43,166
No.

157
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:48,589
Gosh!

158
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:50,741
Ta-da!

159
00:13:57,668 --> 00:13:58,705
I’m begging you,

160
00:13:58,946 --> 00:14:00,175
please go back to how you were.

161
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,493
Get me out of here.

162
00:14:35,168 --> 00:14:35,909
J.

163
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:40,053
So you’re not moving out of Jinn’s place?

164
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:42,548
Why?

165
00:14:43,289 --> 00:14:44,009
Nothing.

166
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,369
I’m just asking.

167
00:14:45,628 --> 00:14:49,210
You threw such a tantrum
when you had to move in.

168
00:14:49,358 --> 00:14:51,418
And now you refuse to move out.

169
00:14:52,844 --> 00:14:54,987
Not. Your. Business.

170
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,170
Fine!

171
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,036
I will remember this.

172
00:14:59,814 --> 00:15:01,929
You two never tell me anything,

173
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:03,856
so I won’t tell you anything either.

174
00:15:04,745 --> 00:15:07,983
Is there anything in your life
even worth me being nosy about?

175
00:15:21,233 --> 00:15:22,625
I ordered stir-fried malindjo leaves with eggs.

176
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:24,672
Hey, just got out of class.

177
00:15:24,968 --> 00:15:26,079
Did I keep you guys waiting?

178
00:15:26,227 --> 00:15:27,676
Great. We just finished eating.

179
00:15:30,157 --> 00:15:31,292
Finished, my ass.

180
00:15:31,403 --> 00:15:33,006
Your plates are still full.

181
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,280
Seriously.

182
00:15:37,873 --> 00:15:39,394
Don’t you have friends from your faculty?

183
00:15:40,301 --> 00:15:41,938
I do have some.

184
00:15:41,938 --> 00:15:42,487
And?

185
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,032
I love you guys more.

186
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:51,103
Wow. You look so disgusted.

187
00:15:51,103 --> 00:15:52,547
I’m sad, you know?

188
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:58,211
Do you have any idea what
I just went through before I came to see you?

189
00:15:58,211 --> 00:15:58,926
What?

190
00:15:59,352 --> 00:16:04,581
My professor just roasted
my assignment like it was trash.

191
00:16:04,711 --> 00:16:06,246
Maybe that’s because you suck.

192
00:16:06,468 --> 00:16:08,197
Damn, listen to that.

193
00:16:08,197 --> 00:16:10,847
Not only did he not comfort me,
he insulted me even more.

194
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:11,638
Guys.

195
00:16:12,286 --> 00:16:14,883
Why don’t you
take me out for drinks tonight?

196
00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:16,286
I need to de-stress.

197
00:16:16,842 --> 00:16:21,083
So all that buildup
just because you want to drink?

198
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:21,931
Don’t you?

199
00:16:21,931 --> 00:16:23,256
My mouth’s watering already.

200
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:24,926
Exactly.

201
00:16:28,537 --> 00:16:29,531
So, what do you say?

202
00:16:40,865 --> 00:16:42,081
Don’t spit it out.

203
00:16:42,229 --> 00:16:43,024
Don’t!

204
00:16:43,024 --> 00:16:44,207
Cheers, come on!

205
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:45,220
Cheers!

206
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,863
Yay!

207
00:16:48,622 --> 00:16:50,068
Man, this is fun.

208
00:16:50,827 --> 00:16:53,133
You two really love to drink, huh?

209
00:16:53,244 --> 00:16:54,557
You seem thirsty all the time.

210
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:57,886
Don’t just sit there. Get up and dance!

211
00:16:57,886 --> 00:16:59,023
No. I don’t dance.

212
00:16:59,023 --> 00:17:01,595
- I’ve seen you dance before.
- Get up.

213
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,146
Don’t you want to dance with them?

214
00:17:06,516 --> 00:17:08,199
No. They look stupid.

215
00:17:08,755 --> 00:17:09,914
They look insane.

216
00:17:10,618 --> 00:17:11,759
They look mad.

217
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:13,186
Look at them.

218
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:14,987
Who would do that?

219
00:17:16,191 --> 00:17:17,485
Cheers.

220
00:17:17,485 --> 00:17:18,370
Hey, where’s the energy?

221
00:17:18,611 --> 00:17:22,680
Cheers!

222
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,505
Cheers!

223
00:17:31,725 --> 00:17:32,682
Give me more.

224
00:17:34,579 --> 00:17:37,291
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

225
00:17:45,156 --> 00:17:45,689
Hey.

226
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:47,993
Want to step out for a cigarette?

227
00:17:48,509 --> 00:17:49,081
Come on.

228
00:17:57,823 --> 00:17:58,377
You want one?

229
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,276
I quit.

230
00:18:00,554 --> 00:18:01,790
Just like that?

231
00:18:04,087 --> 00:18:05,357
Probably because I’ll quit in the future.

232
00:18:06,246 --> 00:18:07,673
So right now, I don’t want it.

233
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:09,889
Again with this?

234
00:18:11,103 --> 00:18:13,212
What did Jinn say when you told him?

235
00:18:13,601 --> 00:18:14,521
He was shocked.

236
00:18:15,706 --> 00:18:17,972
But he’s the one who
should believe this thing the most.

237
00:18:18,954 --> 00:18:22,052
Because the vision I see
is about him and me.

238
00:18:23,571 --> 00:18:24,451
What did you just say?

239
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:29,911
So the one in your dreams is Jinn?

240
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,277
Right now, Jinn and I are boyfriends.

241
00:18:34,425 --> 00:18:34,925
What?!

242
00:18:35,703 --> 00:18:36,428
Are you serious?

243
00:18:37,854 --> 00:18:42,720
It’s what I see ten years from now.

244
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:45,329
And Jinn believed you that easily?

245
00:18:46,103 --> 00:18:48,104
Because what I see is real.

246
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,355
I even saved him from an accident.

247
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,671
So you’re telling me
you can change the future?

248
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,350
Jinn said the same thing.

249
00:18:57,572 --> 00:19:00,053
But that sounds way too dramatic for me.

250
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:02,108
I’m not changing anything.

251
00:19:02,423 --> 00:19:02,923
I…

252
00:19:05,127 --> 00:19:06,189
I just helped him.

253
00:19:06,189 --> 00:19:07,953
What the hell am I hearing here?

254
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,278
Hey, I’ll be right back.

255
00:19:18,834 --> 00:19:19,630
Where are you going?

256
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:38,437
Hey, Farm!

257
00:19:39,326 --> 00:19:40,049
Hey!

258
00:19:41,216 --> 00:19:41,871
Hey.

259
00:19:42,797 --> 00:19:43,692
Wait up.

260
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:45,885
Wait.

261
00:19:48,255 --> 00:19:49,206
I’m sorry.

262
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:50,500
That’s it?

263
00:19:52,148 --> 00:19:54,151
I got carried away. I’m really sorry.

264
00:19:54,244 --> 00:19:56,519
Carried away enough
to forget you have a boyfriend?

265
00:19:58,575 --> 00:20:01,482
You know how I am
and I was so drunk just now.

266
00:20:02,982 --> 00:20:04,560
I don’t even know who that girl is.

267
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,254
So I’m supposed to just
accept the way you are, Van?

268
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:12,601
It’s not like that, Farm.

269
00:20:14,712 --> 00:20:16,405
I’ll try to keep myself in check from now on.

270
00:20:16,405 --> 00:20:17,439
I’m sorry.

271
00:20:18,124 --> 00:20:19,212
I’m truly sorry.

272
00:20:27,475 --> 00:20:28,803
Don’t ever forget you have me.

273
00:20:38,414 --> 00:20:39,464
Hey.

274
00:20:40,094 --> 00:20:41,399
You made it to the bed.

275
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,504
I didn’t know you were such a drunk.

276
00:20:58,856 --> 00:21:00,309
It’s once in a blue moon.

277
00:21:01,476 --> 00:21:02,766
I’m going to shower.

278
00:21:04,451 --> 00:21:06,017
Just lie down.

279
00:21:06,017 --> 00:21:07,192
I’ll give you a sponge bath.

280
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,808
If you shower like this, you’ll slip,
crack your head, and die.

281
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:12,299
Fine.

282
00:22:07,467 --> 00:22:08,352
Are you asleep?

283
00:22:09,926 --> 00:22:10,551
What?

284
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:13,888
I’m sorry.

285
00:22:14,888 --> 00:22:15,585
Mm.

286
00:22:18,733 --> 00:22:19,940
I’m sorry.

287
00:22:20,588 --> 00:22:22,008
I know!

288
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:24,895
I’m sorry!

289
00:22:29,408 --> 00:22:30,328
Get some sleep.

290
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:40,394
I am sorry.

291
00:22:56,711 --> 00:22:57,906
You’re a good kisser.

292
00:22:59,388 --> 00:23:00,930
How many girls have you kissed?

293
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,074
You’re still upset.

294
00:23:04,926 --> 00:23:06,232
I’m just curious.

295
00:23:08,306 --> 00:23:10,994
You know, kissing isn’t
the only thing I’m good at.

296
00:23:36,738 --> 00:23:37,873
So this is your way of making it up to me?

297
00:23:38,595 --> 00:23:39,619
I’m giving it a try.

298
00:23:40,267 --> 00:23:41,737
No idea if it’s working, though.

299
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,133
And if it’s not?

300
00:23:44,744 --> 00:23:46,090
It doesn’t hurt to try.

301
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:04,806
Thank you for caring so much about me.

302
00:24:32,916 --> 00:24:33,594
What?

303
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:37,194
Don’t forget to take your meds.

304
00:24:41,618 --> 00:24:43,626
You shouldn’t be
worrying about someone else.

305
00:26:31,842 --> 00:26:32,762
Is it here?

306
00:26:47,264 --> 00:26:48,515
(You’re not my dad!)

307
00:26:49,413 --> 00:26:50,280
(Jinn.)

308
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,111
(And I’m not your son!)

309
00:26:51,111 --> 00:26:52,105
(Jinn.)

310
00:26:52,105 --> 00:26:53,124
(Jinn, wake up.)

311
00:26:54,603 --> 00:26:55,241
Auntie Jan.

312
00:26:56,174 --> 00:26:56,934
Auntie Jan.

313
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,652
Jinn, wake up.

314
00:26:58,934 --> 00:26:59,923
Auntie Jan.

315
00:27:12,068 --> 00:27:12,815
Hello.

316
00:27:13,554 --> 00:27:15,437
(Where are you? Are you out?)

317
00:27:17,021 --> 00:27:17,795
Uh…

318
00:27:18,517 --> 00:27:20,958
(I took the sleeping pills last night.)

319
00:27:21,328 --> 00:27:22,918
(So I woke up early.)

320
00:27:23,288 --> 00:27:25,490
(Now I’m running outside.)

321
00:27:27,321 --> 00:27:28,153
Which park?

322
00:27:30,406 --> 00:27:32,157
Not far from he condo.

323
00:27:32,579 --> 00:27:33,297
I’ll be back soon.

324
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:34,399
Should I pick you up?

325
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,109
Don’t drive!

326
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,292
Why are you shouting?

327
00:27:44,675 --> 00:27:45,690
I’m sorry.

328
00:27:46,377 --> 00:27:47,757
It’s loud here.

329
00:27:48,743 --> 00:27:49,754
I thought you wouldn’t hear me.

330
00:27:51,618 --> 00:27:54,009
Are you coming back
so we can go to uni together?

331
00:27:54,502 --> 00:27:55,973
Yes, I am.

332
00:27:57,927 --> 00:27:58,531
(Okay.)

333
00:27:58,901 --> 00:28:00,199
(I’ll make coffee for you.)

334
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:01,646
Sure.

335
00:28:17,149 --> 00:28:18,316
So where did you go this morning?

336
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,394
I told you, I was out running.

337
00:28:21,618 --> 00:28:22,519
Why didn’t you ask me to go too?

338
00:28:23,153 --> 00:28:24,404
You couldn’t even sleep
without feeling like puking.

339
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:26,671
How dare you expect me
to wake you up to run?

340
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:30,864
Oh, shit!

341
00:28:31,128 --> 00:28:31,628
Shit!

342
00:28:40,171 --> 00:28:40,805
Jinn.

343
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:42,610
Don’t move him!

344
00:28:43,015 --> 00:28:44,666
Van, call an ambulance now.

345
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:45,937
Okay, I’m on it.

346
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,831
Please come quickly.

347
00:29:04,941 --> 00:29:07,364
J, the doctor said he’ll be fine.

348
00:29:07,364 --> 00:29:08,319
You don’t need to look so gloomy.

349
00:29:09,234 --> 00:29:11,190
If he’s fine, then why isn’t he waking up?

350
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:12,879
Give him time.

351
00:29:12,879 --> 00:29:14,693
He got stitches and injections.

352
00:29:14,693 --> 00:29:15,654
It’s normal for him to sleep.

353
00:29:18,119 --> 00:29:19,476
Hey—he’s waking up!

354
00:29:19,582 --> 00:29:20,465
How are you?

355
00:29:20,606 --> 00:29:21,619
Do you remember me?

356
00:29:21,619 --> 00:29:22,340
What’s my name?

357
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,298
What’s your name?

358
00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:23,987
Come on!

359
00:29:24,691 --> 00:29:26,582
His condition’s going to
get worse because of you two.

360
00:29:29,293 --> 00:29:30,309
How are you feeling?

361
00:29:32,633 --> 00:29:33,691
You’ve got a concussion.

362
00:29:34,113 --> 00:29:36,940
But you’ve been scanned
and the doctor said nothing’s serious.

363
00:29:39,581 --> 00:29:40,522
What hit me?

364
00:29:40,874 --> 00:29:41,991
You don’t remember anything?

365
00:29:44,456 --> 00:29:47,750
I remember walking… then passing out.

366
00:29:48,595 --> 00:29:49,698
A metal piece fell from the roof.

367
00:29:50,825 --> 00:29:52,263
It grazed your head.

368
00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:54,252
Damn.

369
00:29:54,991 --> 00:29:56,414
Glad I didn’t get brain damage.

370
00:29:57,048 --> 00:29:58,737
We’re glad you’re okay.

371
00:29:59,899 --> 00:30:01,159
It’s already late.

372
00:30:01,618 --> 00:30:02,914
We’ll head out now.

373
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:04,728
Already?

374
00:30:05,256 --> 00:30:06,608
Why don’t we stay and play with Jinn first?

375
00:30:06,608 --> 00:30:08,145
He’s injured. Let him rest.

376
00:30:08,638 --> 00:30:10,077
Mai, come with me. I’ll drop you off.

377
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,910
Good thing you have a hard skull.

378
00:30:13,315 --> 00:30:15,092
I should borrow it to make a talisman.

379
00:30:15,374 --> 00:30:16,017
Moron.

380
00:30:16,792 --> 00:30:18,160
Yep, he’s fine.

381
00:30:18,723 --> 00:30:19,223
Come on.

382
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:20,958
I’ll walk you guys out.

383
00:30:21,618 --> 00:30:22,559
Bye-bye.

384
00:30:22,788 --> 00:30:23,809
Get well soon.

385
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,520
Bye.

386
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:43,684
What’s wrong?

387
00:30:45,603 --> 00:30:47,477
I took sleeping pills last night,

388
00:30:48,516 --> 00:30:49,330
so I didn’t dream.

389
00:30:51,073 --> 00:30:52,536
If I had, I would’ve been able to help you.

390
00:31:02,651 --> 00:31:03,192
Look.

391
00:31:04,442 --> 00:31:05,720
It was an accident.

392
00:31:07,938 --> 00:31:09,673
But I was able to help you last time.

393
00:31:10,483 --> 00:31:12,285
I hate that you’re blaming yourself.

394
00:31:15,401 --> 00:31:16,307
It’s my body.

395
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,344
Whatever happens to it,

396
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:21,015
whatever hurts—it's on me.

397
00:31:22,353 --> 00:31:23,543
It’s not your fault.

398
00:31:39,289 --> 00:31:44,090
This is what I’ve been afraid of
ever since I knew you could see the future.

399
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:51,109
Thank you for caring so much about me.

400
00:31:52,623 --> 00:31:54,453
But if something happens to me one day…

401
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:59,702
or if tomorrow I—

402
00:32:06,726 --> 00:32:09,788
I told you not to say things like that.

403
00:32:11,618 --> 00:32:12,905
It’s unavoidable.

404
00:32:14,577 --> 00:32:16,576
People die. That’s how life works.

405
00:32:16,576 --> 00:32:17,159
Jinn.

406
00:32:20,398 --> 00:32:21,574
Promise me.

407
00:32:22,613 --> 00:32:24,129
If something happens to me one day,

408
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:26,748
don’t blame yourself.

409
00:32:27,452 --> 00:32:28,897
I can’t promise that.

410
00:32:30,904 --> 00:32:31,721
Then we should break up.

411
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:35,874
Why are you saying this?

412
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:38,283
If we’re together but not happy,

413
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:40,148
why keep going?

414
00:32:41,204 --> 00:32:43,345
You’ll always be paranoid,
always terrified I’ll die.

415
00:32:44,384 --> 00:32:46,675
And what if you’re wrong? If I’m safe?

416
00:32:47,168 --> 00:32:48,863
You might be the one
who ends up losing your mind.

417
00:32:48,863 --> 00:32:49,672
I’m not breaking up.

418
00:32:54,619 --> 00:32:55,780
Then give me the promise.

419
00:32:57,023 --> 00:33:00,481
From here on out, we live a normal life.

420
00:33:02,963 --> 00:33:06,039
I won’t mind if you see something
in your dreams and want to help me

421
00:33:07,676 --> 00:33:08,888
because I’m scared of dying too.

422
00:33:11,335 --> 00:33:13,284
But if something happens to me one day,

423
00:33:17,421 --> 00:33:18,845
I’ll believe you did your best.

424
00:33:56,729 --> 00:33:57,892
Be careful.

425
00:33:58,314 --> 00:33:59,937
I hurt my head, not my feet.

426
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:01,767
Just let me take care of you. Hm?

427
00:34:55,466 --> 00:34:56,688
Sleeping like a log, huh?

428
00:35:19,347 --> 00:35:20,222
Be careful.

429
00:35:20,728 --> 00:35:22,199
I hurt my head, not my feet.

430
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:23,359
I can walk.

431
00:35:24,370 --> 00:35:25,412
Can’t I worry about you?

432
00:35:26,676 --> 00:35:28,546
Why don’t you just carry me, then?

433
00:35:28,857 --> 00:35:29,956
J! I was joking.

434
00:35:33,728 --> 00:35:34,893
I missed my room.

435
00:35:40,302 --> 00:35:42,742
So you didn’t tell my mom, right?

436
00:35:43,306 --> 00:35:44,182
Do you want me to?

437
00:35:45,971 --> 00:35:46,924
Good thing you didn’t.

438
00:35:47,624 --> 00:35:49,186
My mom might sue the university.

439
00:35:49,828 --> 00:35:51,306
That would just turn it into a huge drama.

440
00:35:52,667 --> 00:35:56,611
Then stay here until your wound heals.

441
00:35:58,497 --> 00:35:59,336
I guess that’s how it has to be.

442
00:36:00,581 --> 00:36:01,920
If you need anything, ask me.

443
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:03,787
Don’t walk too much.

444
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,842
I already told you I didn’t hurt my feet.

445
00:36:07,678 --> 00:36:09,861
Just let me take care of you.

446
00:36:10,172 --> 00:36:10,672
Hm?

447
00:36:11,644 --> 00:36:12,221
Fine.

448
00:36:13,154 --> 00:36:14,676
I’ll make you do everything.

449
00:36:27,717 --> 00:36:29,781
I’ll go fix the bed for you.

450
00:37:19,542 --> 00:37:20,733
Still working?

451
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:22,862
Yes, but I’m almost done.

452
00:37:29,051 --> 00:37:30,153
Why are you so pretty today?

453
00:37:33,775 --> 00:37:34,432
Let’s go, Jan.

454
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:50,592
If you choose him,

455
00:37:50,592 --> 00:37:51,789
then you don’t need me in your life.

456
00:37:51,789 --> 00:37:52,449
- Jinn.
- Jinn.

457
00:38:09,047 --> 00:38:10,813
I can actually go to class, you know.

458
00:38:12,038 --> 00:38:12,917
Just rest.

459
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:14,489
You have a medical certificate.

460
00:38:14,936 --> 00:38:16,644
Staying in is boring.

461
00:38:18,044 --> 00:38:19,297
I’ll be back soon to keep you company.

462
00:38:21,844 --> 00:38:22,522
Fine.

463
00:38:22,969 --> 00:38:25,270
Your lunch and dinner are in the fridge.

464
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:26,545
Heat them up when you’re hungry.

465
00:38:26,895 --> 00:38:27,564
Yes, sir.

466
00:38:28,342 --> 00:38:29,402
If you need anything, call me.

467
00:38:30,258 --> 00:38:30,790
Noted.

468
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:32,792
I’m heading out now.

469
00:38:33,569 --> 00:38:34,444
Go already.

470
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:40,110
What?

471
00:38:40,343 --> 00:38:41,745
I said you were lonely just now.

472
00:38:42,912 --> 00:38:43,557
Okay, I’m off.

473
00:38:44,082 --> 00:38:44,990
Bye-bye.

474
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:02,663
Here.

475
00:39:03,344 --> 00:39:04,078
Remove it.

476
00:39:05,128 --> 00:39:06,657
I’ll show you the ropes, kiddo.

477
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:10,166
You start with this. Makes it easier.

478
00:39:13,277 --> 00:39:13,952
There.

479
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:20,295
I like you when you’re like this.

480
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,385
You’ve said that before.

481
00:39:24,474 --> 00:39:25,008
Hey!

482
00:39:26,388 --> 00:39:27,717
We’re in the classroom.

483
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:28,922
So?

484
00:39:29,272 --> 00:39:30,128
No one saw us.

485
00:39:30,847 --> 00:39:32,041
Like hell they didn’t.

486
00:39:32,935 --> 00:39:34,179
Why? Want me to do it again?

487
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,225
Van!

488
00:39:37,033 --> 00:39:38,466
Alright, alright. You keep going.

489
00:39:38,797 --> 00:39:39,772
This part is done.

490
00:39:44,536 --> 00:39:46,568
So J decided to skip too?

491
00:39:46,568 --> 00:39:48,125
Yeah. I think he’s staying in with Jinn.

492
00:39:49,175 --> 00:39:49,967
What’s up with those two?

493
00:39:49,967 --> 00:39:51,363
They stick together like spouses.

494
00:39:52,296 --> 00:39:53,012
Hey!

495
00:39:53,693 --> 00:39:56,023
Folks from my faculty
are throwing a party tonight.

496
00:39:56,276 --> 00:39:56,956
Are you in?

497
00:39:57,559 --> 00:39:59,802
No. I’m staying in. Don’t feel like going out.

498
00:40:01,007 --> 00:40:02,366
Gosh, you’re boring.

499
00:40:12,024 --> 00:40:14,208
Welcome to The J. Room.

500
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:29,091
Have some water, dear.

501
00:40:29,091 --> 00:40:29,755
Thank you.

502
00:40:29,911 --> 00:40:31,149
Is it just you?

503
00:40:31,616 --> 00:40:32,176
Yes.

504
00:40:33,868 --> 00:40:34,908
Is something wrong, son?

505
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,476
Wait, did Jinn cause some trouble?

506
00:40:40,476 --> 00:40:41,922
No, Auntie Jan.

507
00:40:42,991 --> 00:40:46,349
Then what’s so urgent
that you came to see me here?

508
00:40:47,535 --> 00:40:48,388
Well…

509
00:40:49,632 --> 00:40:50,614
It’s…

510
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:51,977
J.

511
00:40:52,502 --> 00:40:54,130
You can talk to me.

512
00:41:01,226 --> 00:41:02,136
About Uncle Jet…

513
00:41:03,108 --> 00:41:04,845
When are you planning to tell Jinn?

514
00:41:05,953 --> 00:41:07,457
How did you find out, dear?

515
00:41:07,457 --> 00:41:08,686
When did you learn about this?

516
00:41:11,019 --> 00:41:13,154
I’d like you to talk to Jinn soon.

517
00:41:13,485 --> 00:41:14,686
I don’t want him to find out on his own.

518
00:41:17,836 --> 00:41:21,238
Do you know
I think about this every single day?

519
00:41:22,521 --> 00:41:25,557
I want Jinn to make peace with his father.

520
00:41:26,918 --> 00:41:29,326
There’s so much he doesn’t know.

521
00:41:31,912 --> 00:41:34,261
That’s why I want you to
patch things up with him as soon as you can.

522
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:39,099
You know how Jinn is, don’t you?

523
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:41,402
Yes.

524
00:41:42,043 --> 00:41:44,386
Just hearing the name Jet
is enough to make him explode.

525
00:41:50,355 --> 00:41:52,468
If there’s anything I can do to help,

526
00:41:54,218 --> 00:41:55,559
please tell me, Auntie Jan.

527
00:41:57,037 --> 00:41:58,179
I really…

528
00:42:00,046 --> 00:42:02,628
want you to settle this with Jinn.

529
00:42:21,482 --> 00:42:25,696
(Eat, then take your meds
so you can recover soon. Love you.)

530
00:42:28,263 --> 00:42:32,294
I’ll find a time to
talk to Jinn as soon as possible.

531
00:42:32,527 --> 00:42:33,583
Sure, Auntie Jan.

532
00:42:33,583 --> 00:42:34,359
I’ll get going then.

533
00:42:34,962 --> 00:42:35,656
Thanks, dear.

534
00:42:52,075 --> 00:42:54,234
(From what I’ve seen in the movies…)

535
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:58,757
when you decide to change something,

536
00:42:59,418 --> 00:43:03,991
it affects the future. Right?

537
00:43:21,588 --> 00:43:23,567
(This is your lunch. Love you.)

538
00:43:23,742 --> 00:43:25,858
(This is your dinner. Love you.)

539
00:44:08,713 --> 00:44:09,593
(Love you.)

540
00:44:16,651 --> 00:44:19,634
Is there anything else
about you that I still don’t know?

541
00:44:19,634 --> 00:44:21,067
You’re my boyfriend now.

542
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:24,817
If being with me doesn’t make your life better,
then why be with me at all?

543
00:44:25,109 --> 00:44:26,588
I’ll tell you if anything happens next time.

544
00:44:26,977 --> 00:44:27,615
Okay?

545
00:44:32,806 --> 00:44:33,581
J!

546
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:35,508
Jinn, don’t go.

547
00:44:37,413 --> 00:44:43,128
Does that mean in two years
Auntie Jan will die and you’ll disappear?

548
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:44,960
I just want to hug you tight.

549
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:48,376
Your hug feels like
I’m being wrapped by a snake.

550
00:44:48,862 --> 00:44:49,918
Well, I love you.

551
00:44:50,462 --> 00:44:53,761
When will you tell people about us?

552
00:44:53,997 --> 00:44:55,407
Even if we haven’t,
it already feels like we have.

553
00:44:55,621 --> 00:44:56,849
I mean with our parents.

554
00:44:57,821 --> 00:44:58,596
I just realized something.

555
00:44:59,257 --> 00:45:00,296
Realized what?

556
00:45:00,549 --> 00:45:01,746
A way to make you feel better.

557
00:45:01,882 --> 00:45:02,459
Huh?
