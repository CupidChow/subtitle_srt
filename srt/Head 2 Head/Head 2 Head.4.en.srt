4

What were you thinking,

5
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:16,245
making your crush your roommate?

6
00:00:16,388 --> 00:00:17,111
You know?

7
00:00:19,174 --> 00:00:20,618
Farm’s a very good person.

8
00:00:20,741 --> 00:00:23,331
Mess with whoever you want,
just not with friends.

9
00:00:23,331 --> 00:00:25,179
I promise I won’t hurt him.

10
00:00:26,487 --> 00:00:29,382
How come I’ve never
seen this notebook before?

11
00:00:29,525 --> 00:00:30,651
How would you?

12
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:33,993
I hid it in my underwear drawer.

13
00:00:42,117 --> 00:00:48,819
BEING THIS CLOSE TO YOU...
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO STOP MYSELF
FROM FEELING SOMETHING FOR YOU?

14
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,984
You prick. Why are you touching my stuff?!

15
00:00:56,984 --> 00:00:57,484
Jinn.

16
00:00:57,484 --> 00:00:59,080
What the hell’s wrong with you?
It’s my personal stuff!

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,368
Just go home!

18
00:01:00,368 --> 00:01:01,051
Damn it.

19
00:01:01,521 --> 00:01:02,212
Jinn!

20
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:03,622
Hear me out first.

21
00:01:03,928 --> 00:01:05,129
No. Let go of me.

22
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,003
Hear me out!

23
00:01:06,003 --> 00:01:06,719
Hands off me!

24
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:07,837
Just listen.

25
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:11,725
Do you still like me?

26
00:01:18,091 --> 00:01:19,027
- Damn it.
- Jinn!

27
00:01:19,231 --> 00:01:19,914
Get off me!

28
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:21,234
Ouch.

29
00:01:32,547 --> 00:01:33,700
Can we talk, Jinn?

30
00:03:26,908 --> 00:03:27,981
I’ll talk to my mom.

31
00:03:28,553 --> 00:03:29,475
You can start packing.

32
00:03:41,605 --> 00:03:42,323
You know?

33
00:03:42,732 --> 00:03:45,341
If you’re yelling at me,
laughing at me, teasing me,

34
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:47,452
it’s still better than you staying quiet like this.

35
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:50,844
I just don’t know what to say.

36
00:03:51,886 --> 00:03:53,113
Then do what I said.

37
00:03:53,705 --> 00:03:55,693
Pack your stuff and get out of my place.

38
00:03:57,491 --> 00:03:59,107
Why didn’t you tell me anything?

39
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:01,059
Tell you?

40
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,435
What would I even tell you?

41
00:04:02,782 --> 00:04:04,071
Anything.

42
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:06,173
Anything you wanted to say.

43
00:04:06,316 --> 00:04:08,228
Whatever you’re feeling.

44
00:04:08,473 --> 00:04:09,791
Not pushing me away like this.

45
00:04:10,118 --> 00:04:11,364
What the hell is wrong with you?

46
00:04:11,589 --> 00:04:13,683
Have you forgotten that
you don’t want to be here?

47
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:15,963
We don’t have to listen to our moms.

48
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:17,302
We’re grownups.

49
00:04:17,302 --> 00:04:18,582
Why should we let them force us?

50
00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:26,982
How did you find it anyway?

51
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:28,826
No.

52
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:30,070
You went through my stuff…

53
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,293
(How come I’ve never
seen this notebook before?)

54
00:04:32,293 --> 00:04:34,446
- (How would you?)
- You’re such a creep.

55
00:04:34,589 --> 00:04:37,720
I hid it in my underwear drawer.

56
00:04:40,662 --> 00:04:42,273
If you came across it, that’d be weird.

57
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:43,784
Why would you go through
my underwear drawer?

58
00:04:43,907 --> 00:04:45,081
(Answer me.)

59
00:04:45,204 --> 00:04:46,145
You’re right.

60
00:04:46,247 --> 00:04:47,167
(Why did you do it?)

61
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:48,865
Well, answer me!

62
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:51,620
Why did you go through
my underwear drawer?

63
00:04:51,865 --> 00:04:53,242
Can we talk about something else first?

64
00:04:53,487 --> 00:04:55,992
You’re dragging this,
beating around the f*cking bush.

65
00:04:55,992 --> 00:04:57,287
Just know that I’m sorry.

66
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,533
I’m sorry for messing with your things.

67
00:05:01,758 --> 00:05:04,122
But please calm down and talk to me nicely.

68
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:06,923
What is there to talk about?

69
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:09,853
Just yell at me or tease me.

70
00:05:10,446 --> 00:05:11,504
There’s nothing to talk about.

71
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,063
And why would I do that?

72
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,705
You’ve always done that.

73
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:18,260
You right now don’t seem like yourself at all.

74
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:21,818
Forget it.

75
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:25,792
If you want to amend,

76
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,703
just act like you never saw this notebook.

77
00:05:33,094 --> 00:05:34,227
I can do that

78
00:05:37,046 --> 00:05:38,431
if it means I can keep staying here.

79
00:05:40,801 --> 00:05:41,683
What the heck?

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,014
I don’t want to move out.

81
00:05:43,913 --> 00:05:45,150
I want to live here.

82
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:49,967
I want to live with you.

83
00:05:54,968 --> 00:05:55,696
Gosh.

84
00:05:56,472 --> 00:05:57,507
I hate you.

85
00:06:26,641 --> 00:06:28,149
Give me your hand. I’ll dress your wound.

86
00:06:32,153 --> 00:06:34,520
You’re going to dress my wound?

87
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,969
Because you went nuts
and refused to go to the hospital today.

88
00:06:39,297 --> 00:06:40,591
I’ll clean it my way for now.

89
00:06:40,591 --> 00:06:41,886
You can have it done properly tomorrow.

90
00:06:43,316 --> 00:06:44,817
Today! Get up.

91
00:07:10,706 --> 00:07:11,483
Does it hurt more?

92
00:07:12,443 --> 00:07:13,128
What?

93
00:07:15,253 --> 00:07:19,867
I pushed you
and your hand hit the wardrobe.

94
00:07:20,684 --> 00:07:21,838
You made a face like it hurt.

95
00:07:24,351 --> 00:07:25,632
You worried about me?

96
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:28,844
In your f*cking dreams.

97
00:07:29,314 --> 00:07:31,419
I’m just asking out of basic human morality.

98
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,118
If you don’t want to answer, then don’t.

99
00:07:48,285 --> 00:07:49,421
And rest assured.

100
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:53,021
I asked my senior friend,
who’s a doctor, how to do this.

101
00:07:55,248 --> 00:07:58,188
Tomorrow, get it cleaned before uni.

102
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:01,096
It didn’t hurt, did it?

103
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:03,276
No.

104
00:08:03,766 --> 00:08:04,394
Good.

105
00:08:04,762 --> 00:08:05,302
Get some sleep.

106
00:08:06,344 --> 00:08:07,651
I’ll take a shower.

107
00:08:09,612 --> 00:08:10,824
- Jinn.
- Hm?

108
00:08:11,192 --> 00:08:14,090
You have a senior friend who’s a doctor?

109
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:14,590
Mm.

110
00:08:14,937 --> 00:08:15,699
Do I know them?

111
00:08:16,148 --> 00:08:16,828
Yeah.

112
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:17,936
It’s Pim.

113
00:08:20,122 --> 00:08:21,444
Pim?

114
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:24,406
Isn’t she a veterinarian?

115
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,927
Jinn, you dickhead.

116
00:08:27,765 --> 00:08:28,398
Damn it.

117
00:08:55,206 --> 00:08:56,801
Hey, hey, hey.

118
00:08:56,964 --> 00:08:58,310
Help me pick. Which one is it?

119
00:08:58,433 --> 00:08:59,809
One or two?

120
00:09:00,851 --> 00:09:01,665
Where are you going?

121
00:09:02,155 --> 00:09:03,228
A friend’s birthday party.

122
00:09:03,698 --> 00:09:04,404
The black one.

123
00:09:04,567 --> 00:09:05,157
Thought so too.

124
00:09:09,113 --> 00:09:09,834
Van!

125
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:11,767
Why don’t you change in the bathroom?

126
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,450
As if you’ve never changed
in front of your friends.

127
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,737
What about perfume?

128
00:09:26,922 --> 00:09:27,611
Which one?

129
00:09:27,897 --> 00:09:29,495
Don’t you already have your usual now?

130
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,237
Use that.

131
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:32,610
I just bought this new one.

132
00:09:33,182 --> 00:09:34,221
It smells nice too.

133
00:09:35,672 --> 00:09:37,446
Smell them both and see.

134
00:09:40,307 --> 00:09:40,952
This is the old one.

135
00:09:44,527 --> 00:09:45,171
So?

136
00:09:45,763 --> 00:09:48,190
I think the old one is already nice.

137
00:09:49,804 --> 00:09:53,313
You just love sticking to the same old stuff.

138
00:09:53,742 --> 00:09:55,019
Well, I already like it.

139
00:09:55,857 --> 00:09:56,982
What can I do?

140
00:10:02,621 --> 00:10:04,433
Tonight, you can just head to bed.

141
00:10:04,556 --> 00:10:05,202
Don’t wait up.

142
00:10:05,651 --> 00:10:06,197
Mm.

143
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:08,123
If you’re drunk, call me. I’ll pick you up.

144
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:12,279
Damn it.

145
00:10:12,504 --> 00:10:13,919
Don’t you ever date anyone.

146
00:10:16,514 --> 00:10:17,552
What are you talking about?

147
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,608
Because once you get a partner,

148
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,497
I’m going to be so jealous of them.

149
00:10:31,955 --> 00:10:33,242
I’m heading out now, babe.

150
00:10:34,059 --> 00:10:34,755
Bye.

151
00:10:46,465 --> 00:10:48,087
How could I do that?

152
00:10:49,476 --> 00:10:50,513
I can’t.

153
00:11:13,615 --> 00:11:14,305
J.

154
00:11:20,381 --> 00:11:21,163
Jinn.

155
00:11:21,653 --> 00:11:22,672
Open your eyes.

156
00:11:22,672 --> 00:11:24,597
Jinn, wake up.

157
00:11:25,516 --> 00:11:27,242
Jinn, open your eyes.

158
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,761
Jinn.

159
00:11:31,703 --> 00:11:33,002
Jinn, wake up.

160
00:11:43,624 --> 00:11:44,324
J!

161
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:50,604
J, are you alright?

162
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:12,603
J, what’s wrong?

163
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:23,329
Are you okay?

164
00:12:26,353 --> 00:12:28,411
I should be the one asking you that.

165
00:12:37,175 --> 00:12:39,453
I… I’m sorry.

166
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:43,751
It’s nothing.

167
00:12:44,241 --> 00:12:46,874
You can go to bed.

168
00:12:52,349 --> 00:12:55,182
I think… if we try to sleep now,

169
00:12:56,449 --> 00:12:58,031
we’ll just end up staring
at the ceiling until dawn.

170
00:13:09,566 --> 00:13:10,525
Does it bother you…

171
00:13:11,403 --> 00:13:13,967
knowing I still have feelings for you?

172
00:13:35,545 --> 00:13:37,093
We’re sitting out here
getting eaten by mosquitoes.

173
00:13:38,287 --> 00:13:40,708
How is this any different
from staring at the ceiling?

174
00:13:45,539 --> 00:13:46,908
Don’t you have anything to say to me?

175
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,925
Not right now.

176
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:55,599
Can I ask you something?

177
00:13:56,918 --> 00:13:57,418
Mm.

178
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:01,544
Does it bother you…

179
00:14:02,364 --> 00:14:04,796
knowing I still have feelings for you?

180
00:14:08,308 --> 00:14:09,060
Jinn…

181
00:14:10,397 --> 00:14:12,996
Don’t overthink about me.

182
00:14:12,996 --> 00:14:13,837
Don’t get confused.

183
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,619
I’ve lived with this feeling
for more than ten years.

184
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:19,635
So don’t worry.

185
00:14:21,061 --> 00:14:23,250
I won’t burden you with my feelings.

186
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,924
You must be wondering

187
00:14:35,315 --> 00:14:36,813
why I’m hugging you right now.

188
00:14:41,306 --> 00:14:43,079
Please don’t ask anything yet,

189
00:14:45,521 --> 00:14:50,154
because I can’t figure out the answer myself.

190
00:14:53,506 --> 00:14:54,584
Give me time.

191
00:14:55,796 --> 00:14:57,184
Once I’m sure…

192
00:14:59,591 --> 00:15:01,701
you’ll be the first to know.

193
00:15:11,978 --> 00:15:12,675
Shit.

194
00:15:14,921 --> 00:15:16,371
Why am I letting you hug me

195
00:15:17,387 --> 00:15:20,474
when I should be kicking you off your chair?

196
00:15:40,954 --> 00:15:41,619
Damn it.

197
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,961
What exactly happened to us?

198
00:15:53,194 --> 00:15:54,185
So what just happened there?

199
00:15:54,185 --> 00:15:54,813
A bad dream?

200
00:15:58,254 --> 00:16:00,216
Ever since the accident at the racetrack,

201
00:16:01,622 --> 00:16:02,877
I haven’t had a proper night’s sleep.

202
00:16:04,232 --> 00:16:06,083
I keep dreaming about all sorts of things.

203
00:16:09,292 --> 00:16:10,113
Are they all bad dreams?

204
00:16:12,021 --> 00:16:12,749
Not really.

205
00:16:14,906 --> 00:16:18,164
Sometimes good. Sometimes bad.

206
00:16:19,038 --> 00:16:20,496
Sometimes weird.

207
00:16:21,477 --> 00:16:25,494
Sometimes just basic daily stuff.

208
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:32,013
Can you give me some examples?

209
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,114
They’re just ordinary things.

210
00:16:37,683 --> 00:16:39,031
What’s weird is that…

211
00:16:44,522 --> 00:16:45,211
Is what?

212
00:16:55,765 --> 00:16:59,343
Jinn, I…

213
00:17:03,644 --> 00:17:05,455
VAN

214
00:17:08,307 --> 00:17:09,119
Hello, Van?

215
00:17:26,622 --> 00:17:28,400
I’m glad you guys are still up.

216
00:17:32,376 --> 00:17:34,233
Now, whose foot did that to your face?

217
00:17:35,214 --> 00:17:35,965
Do you see that?

218
00:17:38,389 --> 00:17:39,057
Turn this way.

219
00:17:39,645 --> 00:17:40,326
This way.

220
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:40,889
It’s nothing.

221
00:17:40,889 --> 00:17:41,389
Van.

222
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:45,726
Wow.

223
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:46,899
Here we go again.

224
00:17:52,463 --> 00:17:54,934
Guys, just listen first.

225
00:17:55,611 --> 00:17:57,082
I didn’t start it this time.

226
00:17:57,082 --> 00:17:58,469
I didn’t even do anything.

227
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:00,301
Then how did you get that cut on your face?

228
00:18:02,441 --> 00:18:03,657
Um…

229
00:18:04,744 --> 00:18:05,772
Be honest.

230
00:18:05,950 --> 00:18:08,113
I went to a friend’s birthday party.

231
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:12,359
And I was having a little too much fun. So…

232
00:18:13,482 --> 00:18:14,336
What fun?

233
00:18:14,835 --> 00:18:15,733
Spill everything.

234
00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:19,085
Having a little too much fun
with someone else’s partner?

235
00:18:21,442 --> 00:18:22,569
I knew it.

236
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:24,919
Well, I didn’t know they had a partner.

237
00:18:25,543 --> 00:18:27,466
We were just drinking together.

238
00:18:27,751 --> 00:18:30,448
Next thing I knew,
a bunch of feet came at me.

239
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:31,534
It’s okay, dude.

240
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:32,598
You deserved it.

241
00:18:32,990 --> 00:18:33,659
What?

242
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:35,028
What about Farm? Does he know?

243
00:18:35,028 --> 00:18:35,528
Hey!

244
00:18:36,277 --> 00:18:36,954
Please.

245
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,286
Don’t let Farm know. Ever.

246
00:18:41,962 --> 00:18:46,174
I came to you guys tonight
because I didn’t want to see him.

247
00:18:46,388 --> 00:18:48,482
So keep it between us three.

248
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,690
Why? Why can’t Farm know?

249
00:18:51,850 --> 00:18:53,581
I don’t want to hear him nag.

250
00:18:55,506 --> 00:18:56,284
Let me stay over.

251
00:18:57,443 --> 00:18:58,989
Please, Jinn. Let me stay over.

252
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:00,594
Van!

253
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:01,973
Please, J.

254
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:04,194
Don’t talk to me. Ask Jinn.

255
00:19:04,194 --> 00:19:05,121
Let me spend the night.

256
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,274
My first problem isn’t sorted yet,
and now I’ve got a second one.

257
00:19:12,214 --> 00:19:15,050
I texted Farm and told him
I’m not coming back tonight.

258
00:19:16,975 --> 00:19:18,206
Did you really have to?

259
00:19:18,794 --> 00:19:20,612
You guys are roommates, not boyfriends.

260
00:19:21,913 --> 00:19:26,562
I don’t even have to look
to feel the judgment in your stares.

261
00:19:29,985 --> 00:19:32,501
Spare Farm, I’m begging you.

262
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:34,951
You’ve warned me like a million times.

263
00:19:37,465 --> 00:19:38,862
What if… hypothetically…

264
00:19:39,807 --> 00:19:43,256
Hypothetically. Just hypothetically.

265
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:44,164
What?

266
00:19:45,341 --> 00:19:50,904
What if Farm and I started dating for real?

267
00:19:50,904 --> 00:19:52,120
Would you guys—

268
00:19:52,548 --> 00:19:57,439
I think if you could stop being a prick when
it comes to love, then we can talk about this.

269
00:19:57,938 --> 00:20:02,060
But I’m sure, in this lifetime and the next,
you’re not changing.

270
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:05,842
So stop thinking about it. Trust me.

271
00:20:06,395 --> 00:20:07,427
What?

272
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:10,572
Van.

273
00:20:12,497 --> 00:20:13,380
Seriously, answer me this.

274
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,699
Yes?

275
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,289
Do you ever want to
get serious with anyone at all?

276
00:20:24,457 --> 00:20:25,163
I do.

277
00:20:26,144 --> 00:20:26,992
Of course, I freaking do.

278
00:20:29,605 --> 00:20:31,680
But I don’t know why…

279
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:33,872
after dating someone for a while,

280
00:20:34,478 --> 00:20:36,474
I ended up doing some bad shit to them.

281
00:20:37,455 --> 00:20:42,078
But I’m not happy with
this constant failure in love.

282
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:44,461
Everyone wants a good kind of love, right?

283
00:20:45,852 --> 00:20:46,873
Well…

284
00:20:47,568 --> 00:20:49,884
Before you ask for good love,

285
00:20:50,775 --> 00:20:53,277
try being good love for someone first.

286
00:21:04,809 --> 00:21:05,677
Whoa.

287
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,521
Way to go, Life Coach.

288
00:21:07,521 --> 00:21:08,652
I’m serious.

289
00:21:09,579 --> 00:21:11,171
You just broke your finger, right?

290
00:21:11,171 --> 00:21:13,441
Your brain didn’t get damaged or anything?

291
00:21:13,441 --> 00:21:14,683
Asshole.

292
00:21:15,378 --> 00:21:16,778
I warned you as a friend.

293
00:21:18,436 --> 00:21:23,796
But seriously, after that accident,
you seem a lot more mature.

294
00:21:24,527 --> 00:21:27,046
Both your words and actions.

295
00:21:27,171 --> 00:21:29,773
You seem different.

296
00:21:34,073 --> 00:21:35,084
Don’t you feel it, Jinn?

297
00:21:35,672 --> 00:21:36,846
You’re with him all the time.

298
00:21:38,575 --> 00:21:40,056
I don’t know. Just go to sleep.

299
00:21:40,056 --> 00:21:41,292
It’s almost morning.

300
00:21:45,678 --> 00:21:47,266
Fine. I’ll freaking sleep.

301
00:22:00,436 --> 00:22:01,837
You didn’t come back because

302
00:22:02,942 --> 00:22:04,449
you were scared I’d see your wound, right?

303
00:22:06,214 --> 00:22:06,975
Yes, sir.

304
00:22:08,383 --> 00:22:11,770
And you do know
a wound doesn’t heal in one day?

305
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:13,941
You’re right.

306
00:22:14,547 --> 00:22:15,564
I didn’t think about that.

307
00:22:15,564 --> 00:22:16,232
Van!

308
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:18,134
Easy there.

309
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:21,005
He got checked too
when I took J to the hospital this morning.

310
00:22:21,255 --> 00:22:22,271
The doctor said it’s shallow.

311
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:24,797
No stitches needed.

312
00:22:25,813 --> 00:22:26,429
See?

313
00:22:28,818 --> 00:22:29,499
Hey.

314
00:22:29,838 --> 00:22:32,968
Good thing you got some of that
bad blood knocked out of you.

315
00:22:33,556 --> 00:22:34,449
Mai, you dick.

316
00:22:35,305 --> 00:22:36,622
You always find a chance to roast me.

317
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:37,551
I’m gonna punch you.

318
00:22:37,551 --> 00:22:38,639
You want another cut?

319
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,449
Hey, where are you going?

320
00:22:50,638 --> 00:22:52,076
When it comes to Van,

321
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:54,843
my holy father always loses it.

322
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:56,983
It’s weird.

323
00:22:57,839 --> 00:22:58,531
Is it?

324
00:22:59,190 --> 00:22:59,923
Hm?

325
00:23:04,808 --> 00:23:05,517
Mai.

326
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:08,076
Looks like you’ve got something to say.

327
00:23:20,618 --> 00:23:21,799
My car is fixed.

328
00:23:21,799 --> 00:23:22,947
Really? Let me see.

329
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:29,015
You two are weird.

330
00:23:43,578 --> 00:23:45,883
I’m fine. You don’t have to worry—

331
00:23:45,883 --> 00:23:46,641
Just lie down.

332
00:23:47,212 --> 00:23:48,707
But I’m alright.

333
00:23:48,707 --> 00:23:51,985
J told me it was really late
when you showed up at their place.

334
00:23:53,128 --> 00:23:55,258
You also got up early
to take him to the hospital.

335
00:23:55,258 --> 00:23:57,991
And the meds you took
need to be followed by sleep.

336
00:24:02,325 --> 00:24:03,485
Seriously, Van…

337
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,112
why were you afraid to tell me?

338
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:08,089
Huh?

339
00:24:09,074 --> 00:24:09,656
What did you say?

340
00:24:10,444 --> 00:24:14,573
What made you crash at Jinn’s
instead of coming back to our place?

341
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:22,344
Come on. Don’t be so serious.

342
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:25,344
We’re sharing the place as roommates.

343
00:24:26,546 --> 00:24:27,780
You’re not a freeloader.

344
00:24:28,647 --> 00:24:31,849
It bothers me that you didn’t feel
uncomfortable enough to come back.

345
00:24:32,775 --> 00:24:35,586
And if I’m the reason, I’m definitely not okay.

346
00:24:35,822 --> 00:24:37,096
It’s not like that.

347
00:24:37,411 --> 00:24:41,162
I was just scared you’d get mad
because I got into a fight.

348
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,493
You should’ve been more afraid
of getting hurt than me getting angry.

349
00:24:48,709 --> 00:24:50,361
Yeah. Right?

350
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,964
You’ve got a point.

351
00:24:53,082 --> 00:24:53,799
Van.

352
00:24:54,548 --> 00:24:55,048
Huh?

353
00:24:57,116 --> 00:25:00,543
Whatever happens from now on,
come back to our place.

354
00:25:02,296 --> 00:25:03,671
You don’t have to tell me everything.

355
00:25:04,065 --> 00:25:05,113
Just come back.

356
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,414
Farm.

357
00:25:11,526 --> 00:25:12,635
Get some rest.

358
00:25:13,127 --> 00:25:14,360
I’m gonna go get you the lecture notes.

359
00:25:15,542 --> 00:25:16,236
Wait.

360
00:25:20,629 --> 00:25:23,757
I promise I won’t get into trouble again.

361
00:25:24,545 --> 00:25:25,601
I’m scared I’ll get hurt.

362
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,723
And I don’t want you worrying.

363
00:25:33,672 --> 00:25:34,354
Yeah.

364
00:25:35,162 --> 00:25:36,260
I’ll stop nagging you.

365
00:25:36,871 --> 00:25:38,074
I don’t want to annoy you.

366
00:25:38,941 --> 00:25:40,564
And it wastes my energy.

367
00:25:47,524 --> 00:25:48,804
If I were a good person,

368
00:25:49,237 --> 00:25:51,027
I’d have hit on you a long time ago.

369
00:25:57,429 --> 00:25:59,141
You don’t have to try that hard.

370
00:26:04,843 --> 00:26:05,775
Bye-bye.

371
00:26:16,194 --> 00:26:18,126
Gosh, he’s cute.

372
00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:41,085
Shit!

373
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:42,215
My baby!

374
00:26:44,283 --> 00:26:45,003
What is it?

375
00:26:45,298 --> 00:26:46,452
My car is fixed.

376
00:26:46,964 --> 00:26:47,940
Really? Let me see.

377
00:26:48,886 --> 00:26:49,637
Does it look the same?

378
00:26:49,913 --> 00:26:51,515
Damn, like it never crashed.

379
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:53,060
They fixed it up real nice.

380
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,675
True.

381
00:26:53,793 --> 00:26:54,690
What a relief.

382
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,913
What are you guys doing?

383
00:27:17,783 --> 00:27:19,909
I’m sleeping at my house tonight.

384
00:27:20,776 --> 00:27:21,713
I’m gonna go check on my car too.

385
00:27:22,462 --> 00:27:23,786
Will your mom let you drive?

386
00:27:24,948 --> 00:27:27,166
I just want to see it with my own eyes.

387
00:27:27,521 --> 00:27:30,030
I’ve missed my baby so badly.

388
00:27:31,626 --> 00:27:33,857
Fine. I’m sleeping at my house too.

389
00:27:33,975 --> 00:27:35,926
So tomorrow we can come to class together.

390
00:27:39,945 --> 00:27:40,598
What?

391
00:27:41,839 --> 00:27:43,115
Are you addicted to me?

392
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,885
Addicted?

393
00:27:46,146 --> 00:27:48,358
Can’t be apart for one night, huh?

394
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:50,223
Your heart will just tear?

395
00:27:51,307 --> 00:27:52,052
Moron.

396
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,451
I just want to see my mom.

397
00:28:00,306 --> 00:28:02,440
You two are weird.

398
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:05,925
Weird how?

399
00:28:06,004 --> 00:28:06,639
Right.

400
00:28:15,825 --> 00:28:16,673
Whoa.

401
00:28:19,884 --> 00:28:21,868
Your friend’s garage is awesome.

402
00:28:21,868 --> 00:28:22,452
Right?

403
00:28:22,925 --> 00:28:25,242
I asked for the best mechanic.

404
00:28:25,242 --> 00:28:26,129
Look here.

405
00:28:26,444 --> 00:28:28,022
The paint is spotless.

406
00:28:28,455 --> 00:28:30,705
Even in sunlight,
you can’t see a single scratch.

407
00:28:30,843 --> 00:28:31,417
Yeah?

408
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:33,126
You’re the best dad.

409
00:28:33,362 --> 00:28:35,787
I just want to give you a trophy.

410
00:28:36,398 --> 00:28:37,022
Come here.

411
00:28:39,602 --> 00:28:41,414
What a pity.

412
00:28:42,123 --> 00:28:45,045
Because it’s going to sit here
and collect dust for months.

413
00:28:48,276 --> 00:28:49,649
Auntie Jen.

414
00:28:49,649 --> 00:28:50,885
Hey, honey. You’re here?

415
00:28:53,544 --> 00:28:54,690
Auntie Jen.

416
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,545
Aw.

417
00:28:57,801 --> 00:28:58,724
What’s wrong now?

418
00:28:59,709 --> 00:29:00,657
I’m hungry.

419
00:29:00,657 --> 00:29:01,293
Hungry?

420
00:29:03,066 --> 00:29:04,204
(Bullshit.)

421
00:29:09,802 --> 00:29:11,558
Your mom got you this time.

422
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,479
Surprised, right, Jinn?

423
00:29:13,971 --> 00:29:18,128
I didn’t know she’d run off
on a trip out of town with her friends.

424
00:29:18,542 --> 00:29:20,785
Normally, we tell each other
where we’re going.

425
00:29:21,337 --> 00:29:23,063
This time, I’m really mad.

426
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:25,361
Please tell her that, Auntie Jen.

427
00:29:25,361 --> 00:29:25,861
Hey.

428
00:29:26,531 --> 00:29:28,412
But once she knew you were coming back,

429
00:29:28,491 --> 00:29:31,629
she called and told me to
take good care of you.

430
00:29:33,597 --> 00:29:35,269
Alright, I’m less mad now.

431
00:29:36,589 --> 00:29:37,272
Still mad, though.

432
00:29:37,272 --> 00:29:37,872
What?

433
00:29:38,108 --> 00:29:40,624
So which is it? Mad or not mad?

434
00:29:41,491 --> 00:29:42,328
Well…

435
00:29:42,328 --> 00:29:43,353
Such a child.

436
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,455
You were born on the same day as me.

437
00:29:51,499 --> 00:29:52,887
Child-ish.

438
00:29:53,675 --> 00:29:55,556
As if you’re so mature.

439
00:29:58,078 --> 00:29:59,303
I’m more mature and grown-up.

440
00:29:59,579 --> 00:30:01,032
What, you’re from the future or something?

441
00:30:02,391 --> 00:30:03,796
Enough, enough.

442
00:30:03,934 --> 00:30:05,157
Stop bickering already.

443
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,188
Eat.

444
00:30:07,173 --> 00:30:08,165
Yes, Uncle Wee.

445
00:30:08,835 --> 00:30:11,081
Oh—Uncle Wee, Auntie Jen,

446
00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:14,346
do you know which friend group
my mom went on a trip with?

447
00:30:18,543 --> 00:30:20,976
Didn’t your mom tell you
who she was going with?

448
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,067
I didn’t ask.

449
00:30:23,441 --> 00:30:27,056
Once I knew she’d sneaked off on a trip,
I didn’t feel like asking more.

450
00:30:28,041 --> 00:30:29,720
She should be with her…

451
00:30:31,375 --> 00:30:35,109
friends from the clothing industry.

452
00:30:35,739 --> 00:30:37,026
Ah!

453
00:30:40,611 --> 00:30:42,967
Are you okay being alone?

454
00:30:43,125 --> 00:30:44,663
Do you want to sleep over in J’s room
so you won’t feel lonely?

455
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,064
Ah…

456
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,222
I’m totally fine on my own.

457
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,843
But I might bother you for food sometimes.

458
00:30:51,961 --> 00:30:52,461
Sure.

459
00:30:52,737 --> 00:30:55,949
Sleeping alone must be lonely.

460
00:30:58,037 --> 00:31:01,098
Being apart from you is a bonus in my life.

461
00:31:24,027 --> 00:31:29,843
YOU PUNCHED ME AND THEN
SENT HEALING SUPPLIES?
JUST GO TO HELL, BASTARD.

462
00:31:35,655 --> 00:31:36,155
Hey.

463
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:37,315
Just go to hell, you asshole!

464
00:31:37,315 --> 00:31:38,294
When will you stop screwing with me?

465
00:31:38,294 --> 00:31:40,465
You whine and chase me away
every time you lose a fight.

466
00:31:40,465 --> 00:31:41,160
Damn you.

467
00:31:41,377 --> 00:31:43,020
Enough! Gosh, you’re strong.

468
00:31:43,473 --> 00:31:45,922
I’m begging, guys. Will you stop fighting?

469
00:31:46,178 --> 00:31:47,574
Go meet the god of death in hell.

470
00:31:51,391 --> 00:31:52,384
Shit! Mai!

471
00:31:52,502 --> 00:31:53,518
Did you just hit me?

472
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,533
Sting, doesn’t it?

473
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,357
ORDER FOR: MR. JEROME

474
00:32:26,854 --> 00:32:28,133
Watch this turn.

475
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:28,633
Hey.

476
00:32:28,633 --> 00:32:29,133
See?

477
00:32:29,763 --> 00:32:30,573
Pretty awesome, huh?

478
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:31,333
Then he cuts into the inner lane.

479
00:32:33,524 --> 00:32:34,633
That’s our boy.

480
00:32:34,633 --> 00:32:37,495
Right. He’s great.

481
00:32:45,985 --> 00:32:48,679
Be clingy all you want,
you’re not getting the car keys.

482
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:50,519
Come on, Mom.

483
00:32:50,854 --> 00:32:52,585
I just missed you.

484
00:32:52,959 --> 00:32:55,797
Awww.

485
00:32:56,743 --> 00:32:59,492
So, how is it going living with Jinn?

486
00:32:59,886 --> 00:33:01,735
Do you help him with
the house chores at all?

487
00:33:02,858 --> 00:33:05,486
Why would I? I just let him
take care of everything for me.

488
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,606
Ow, Mom! Why did you hit me?

489
00:33:09,749 --> 00:33:11,786
I can see you two are closer now.

490
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,749
You used to throw punches
the second you saw each other.

491
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:19,059
But now you can eat at the same table.

492
00:33:19,236 --> 00:33:21,299
You even scoop food for each other.

493
00:33:21,535 --> 00:33:23,552
It’s like feeding a dog.

494
00:33:23,788 --> 00:33:25,360
- Feeding a dog?
- Mom!

495
00:33:25,478 --> 00:33:27,354
How could you call that little baby a dog?

496
00:33:28,181 --> 00:33:29,491
He’s no little baby.

497
00:33:29,491 --> 00:33:30,792
We were born on the same day.

498
00:33:30,792 --> 00:33:34,027
You said you were
more grown-up than him at dinner.

499
00:33:34,027 --> 00:33:36,766
Now suddenly, you remember
you share a birthday?

500
00:33:37,101 --> 00:33:37,757
Hm?

501
00:33:39,924 --> 00:33:40,651
Tell me.

502
00:33:42,247 --> 00:33:45,141
When did you two start hating each other?

503
00:33:45,988 --> 00:33:49,622
As far as I remember,
you two were always competing.

504
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:51,468
And always ended up getting hurt.

505
00:33:52,394 --> 00:33:55,557
And always got whipped by you.

506
00:33:56,522 --> 00:33:57,711
Ouch, Mom!

507
00:33:58,122 --> 00:33:58,748
Come here.

508
00:33:58,945 --> 00:33:59,673
Auntie Jen!

509
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:01,670
Auntie!

510
00:34:02,104 --> 00:34:03,764
This time, J started it.

511
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:05,051
Do not talk back.

512
00:34:05,051 --> 00:34:06,342
You both take responsibility.

513
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:07,019
Should I go on?

514
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:07,609
Oh, yeah.

515
00:34:07,609 --> 00:34:08,649
No. Please, no. Enough.

516
00:34:08,649 --> 00:34:11,569
- Come here.
- No more. Mom, help.

517
00:34:11,569 --> 00:34:12,267
No!

518
00:34:14,398 --> 00:34:14,898
Ouch.

519
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:16,648
Just hit J.

520
00:34:16,786 --> 00:34:17,689
Don’t dodge it.

521
00:34:18,241 --> 00:34:20,043
(Why did we have to get punished together?)

522
00:34:20,496 --> 00:34:21,927
(Auntie Jen’s hits are the real deal.)

523
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,543
(Like mother, like son.)

524
00:34:38,062 --> 00:34:38,917
(I finally get it.)

525
00:34:39,666 --> 00:34:43,921
(For you, it can be anyone
in the whole world but me.)

526
00:35:04,632 --> 00:35:05,679
What the hell are you doing?

527
00:35:07,531 --> 00:35:08,626
Have you gone to bed?

528
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,043
What?

529
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:17,046
Gone to bed?

530
00:35:18,937 --> 00:35:21,013
I wouldn’t be standing here if I had.

531
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:24,876
What a dumb question.

532
00:35:26,787 --> 00:35:28,003
Are you sleepy?

533
00:35:29,973 --> 00:35:30,932
Why?

534
00:35:32,488 --> 00:35:35,216
Up for a bike race?

535
00:35:36,477 --> 00:35:37,225
Huh?

536
00:35:38,466 --> 00:35:39,392
Bike race.

537
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:50,069
I’ve never thought that.

538
00:35:51,802 --> 00:35:52,875
I’ve never hated you.

539
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:16,105
What are you doing?

540
00:36:16,626 --> 00:36:19,169
You didn’t remind me the professor is
grading our draping assignment tomorrow.

541
00:36:19,730 --> 00:36:23,025
I slept in the infirmary all day
and totally forgot.

542
00:36:23,346 --> 00:36:25,505
But I saw you finished it yesterday.

543
00:36:25,585 --> 00:36:28,470
Finished, my ass. It’s still far from done.

544
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,915
So you’re going to class
at 10:30 pm to work on it?

545
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:32,970
Do I have a choice?

546
00:36:34,533 --> 00:36:36,630
The building’s closed.
How are you even getting in?

547
00:36:58,454 --> 00:36:59,240
Farm!

548
00:36:59,961 --> 00:37:01,006
You can’t turn it on.

549
00:37:01,647 --> 00:37:03,917
The guard will see we’re in here.

550
00:37:04,338 --> 00:37:06,369
How are you supposed to work in the dark?

551
00:37:06,569 --> 00:37:08,305
You’re going to stab yourself with those pins.

552
00:37:08,305 --> 00:37:10,028
My eyes will adjust.

553
00:37:10,188 --> 00:37:11,440
You, come here.

554
00:37:40,707 --> 00:37:42,037
Aren’t you working on yours?

555
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:43,247
Mine’s done.

556
00:37:43,608 --> 00:37:44,213
What?

557
00:37:45,015 --> 00:37:46,305
Then why did you come with me?

558
00:37:46,726 --> 00:37:48,387
How could I let you come here alone?

559
00:37:48,627 --> 00:37:50,563
Hurry up, so we can go home.

560
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:55,419
Yes, sir.

561
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,254
I’m hurrying.

562
00:38:21,538 --> 00:38:22,528
You suck.

563
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,376
Can’t you go faster?

564
00:38:24,376 --> 00:38:26,566
I’ve got one hand here.
Why don’t you overtake me?

565
00:38:26,566 --> 00:38:29,611
Fine. Since you asked for it.

566
00:38:36,757 --> 00:38:38,346
That’s all you got?

567
00:38:38,346 --> 00:38:39,671
Crap! Damn it.

568
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:24,741
My hand hurts, and I’m still in the lead.

569
00:39:25,723 --> 00:39:27,444
Hey! J! J!

570
00:39:32,735 --> 00:39:33,431
Are you hurt?

571
00:39:33,732 --> 00:39:34,613
Are you injured, J?

572
00:39:36,096 --> 00:39:37,248
No.

573
00:39:39,693 --> 00:39:40,550
You scared me.

574
00:39:59,163 --> 00:40:00,847
What’s wrong with you, though?

575
00:40:01,087 --> 00:40:01,937
Why don’t you go to bed?

576
00:40:02,258 --> 00:40:03,467
Are you addicted to competing or what?

577
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:07,194
You ditched the ‘bonus in your life’
to compete with me.

578
00:40:12,645 --> 00:40:13,331
Hey.

579
00:40:13,752 --> 00:40:14,252
What?

580
00:40:16,436 --> 00:40:17,999
I’ve never thought that.

581
00:40:20,624 --> 00:40:21,331
What?

582
00:40:23,936 --> 00:40:24,876
I’ve never hated you.

583
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:40,248
I think…

584
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,688
I’m throwing the white flag this time.

585
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,650
I’m going home.

586
00:40:52,271 --> 00:40:53,036
Don’t go yet.

587
00:40:56,944 --> 00:40:58,064
Stay and talk to me first.

588
00:41:06,928 --> 00:41:07,645
Hey.

589
00:41:08,727 --> 00:41:10,036
Should we grab something to eat after this?

590
00:41:10,417 --> 00:41:11,483
How about Auntie Yim’s diner?

591
00:41:11,964 --> 00:41:12,919
It’s close by.

592
00:41:16,847 --> 00:41:19,077
Farm, hold it higher. I can’t see.

593
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,477
Farm!

594
00:41:29,371 --> 00:41:32,457
Since when did you
start letting me talk to myself?

595
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,746
What is ‘good love’ anyway?

596
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,200
Can I even be that for you?

597
00:42:10,991 --> 00:42:11,695
Hm?

598
00:42:31,871 --> 00:42:32,663
Are you done?

599
00:42:33,705 --> 00:42:36,742
Ah… only a bit left.

600
00:42:37,624 --> 00:42:39,016
I can finish the rest tomorrow.

601
00:42:40,539 --> 00:42:42,518
My brain’s fried. I can’t think anymore.

602
00:42:45,544 --> 00:42:46,244
Should we go then?

603
00:42:46,244 --> 00:42:46,744
Sure.

604
00:42:47,546 --> 00:42:48,199
Let’s go.

605
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:49,886
Let me grab my stuff.

606
00:42:50,748 --> 00:42:51,438
Let’s go.

607
00:42:57,730 --> 00:42:58,653
Oh, shit!

608
00:43:31,302 --> 00:43:32,369
- Van…
- Shh!

609
00:43:47,253 --> 00:43:48,132
He should be gone already.

610
00:43:57,096 --> 00:43:59,608
We came in through that door, not this one.

611
00:44:00,169 --> 00:44:01,793
We almost got caught, dude.

612
00:44:02,094 --> 00:44:03,249
I didn’t know.

613
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,292
I always use this door.

614
00:44:07,777 --> 00:44:08,531
Come on.

615
00:44:09,533 --> 00:44:10,243
Come.

616
00:44:14,772 --> 00:44:19,970
This evening, my dad asked
when we even started hating each other.

617
00:44:23,738 --> 00:44:25,174
And I honestly couldn’t think of a reason

618
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:30,066
why we hate each other.

619
00:44:36,290 --> 00:44:37,963
What do you gain from bringing this up?

620
00:44:44,536 --> 00:44:46,484
Then I thought it through.

621
00:44:47,827 --> 00:44:54,288
I realized the reason I couldn’t
give him the answer was because…

622
00:44:58,336 --> 00:44:59,834
I’ve never hated you.

623
00:45:03,341 --> 00:45:04,013
Asshole.

624
00:45:04,815 --> 00:45:05,573
What now?

625
00:45:06,976 --> 00:45:11,866
Now that you know I still ike you,
you want to level up your pranks on me?

626
00:45:14,411 --> 00:45:19,707
Act all nice, say sweet things, soften me up,
and then laugh in my face in the end?

627
00:45:21,054 --> 00:45:22,794
Jinn, calm down.

628
00:45:22,794 --> 00:45:24,025
I’m not falling for that.

629
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:32,399
J.

630
00:45:34,603 --> 00:45:36,036
You wrote in your notebook:

631
00:45:37,138 --> 00:45:42,667
“I finally get it. For you, it can be
anyone in the whole world but me.”

632
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:45,757
That’s not what I think.

633
00:45:47,941 --> 00:45:52,193
You promised me you’d forget
everything in that notebook.

634
00:45:52,413 --> 00:45:53,115
No.

635
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:54,893
I’m not forgetting it.

636
00:45:56,176 --> 00:45:57,195
I remember everything.

637
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:59,714
Every word.

638
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:03,755
You’re an asshole.

639
00:46:09,587 --> 00:46:10,545
I won’t forget it.

640
00:46:14,408 --> 00:46:16,028
Because it helped me
figure out my own feelings too.

641
00:47:15,762 --> 00:47:16,858
You don’t have to force anything.

642
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,421
Just be yourself.

643
00:47:18,421 --> 00:47:20,584
I just want to be a better person.

644
00:47:20,684 --> 00:47:22,081
Can’t I?

645
00:47:22,963 --> 00:47:24,805
Now that I’m with him twenty-four seven,

646
00:47:24,805 --> 00:47:26,115
I feel like…

647
00:47:26,115 --> 00:47:26,765
Jinn!

648
00:47:27,046 --> 00:47:28,948
It’s weird that he’s actually a good person.

649
00:47:30,511 --> 00:47:32,144
Don’t tell me you’ve already fallen for him.

650
00:47:34,609 --> 00:47:35,776
You’ve recovered. Go home.

651
00:47:35,776 --> 00:47:36,926
I said I haven’t recovered yet.

652
00:47:37,427 --> 00:47:38,664
Bad personality.

653
00:47:38,844 --> 00:47:40,276
Mediocre looks.

654
00:47:40,677 --> 00:47:41,988
What’s there to like?
