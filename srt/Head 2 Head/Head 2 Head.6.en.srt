Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:13,366 --> 00:00:18,605
Before you ask for good love,
try being good love for someone first.

5
00:00:21,815 --> 00:00:23,234
I’m just trying to be a slightly better person.

6
00:00:23,234 --> 00:00:24,525
You act like you’ve seen a ghost.

7
00:00:24,525 --> 00:00:25,814
You don’t have to force it.

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:27,324
You can just be yourself.

9
00:00:27,324 --> 00:00:30,526
So when I see you having nightmares
and waking up at night all the time,

10
00:00:30,704 --> 00:00:32,395
you’re actually…

11
00:00:32,484 --> 00:00:33,984
I know it’s hard to believe.

12
00:00:34,163 --> 00:00:35,572
But I’ve proved everything.

13
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:38,995
So what happens to you and me
way in the future?

14
00:00:39,463 --> 00:00:40,496
We’re boyfriends.

15
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:41,887
What?

16
00:00:43,247 --> 00:00:44,482
You and I love each other.

17
00:00:47,336 --> 00:00:49,036
We do love each other.

18
00:01:29,601 --> 00:01:30,770
Are you kidding me?

19
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:35,053
I wish I were.

20
00:01:37,461 --> 00:01:38,031
Why?

21
00:01:39,123 --> 00:01:40,960
After knowing that
you and I end up together in the future,

22
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,089
you feel grossed out?

23
00:01:46,121 --> 00:01:46,828
No.

24
00:01:48,634 --> 00:01:50,031
I just think it’s a waste of time.

25
00:01:51,614 --> 00:01:52,419
A waste of time?

26
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,044
If we already know we love each other,

27
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:58,709
why waste time
pretending to hate each other, right?

28
00:02:01,273 --> 00:02:03,440
So… now what?

29
00:02:03,797 --> 00:02:04,994
What do you mean?

30
00:02:05,596 --> 00:02:06,567
You and I…

31
00:02:07,615 --> 00:02:08,602
what do we do now?

32
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:13,588
We’re boyfriends, of course.

33
00:02:14,435 --> 00:02:15,516
What the hell are we waiting for?

34
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,255
Ow!

35
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:31,874
Jinn!

36
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:23,361
Should I sell your car to a used-car market?

37
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:25,410
I don’t think you should.

38
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:26,986
This isn’t funny.

39
00:04:28,212 --> 00:04:29,644
I’m sorry, Mom.

40
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,717
I regret what I did.

41
00:04:31,717 --> 00:04:33,599
You’re not a kid anymore, Jerome.

42
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:35,950
Do you realize how worried we were?

43
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,561
And Jinn even had to
go out and help look for you.

44
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:40,562
It was no trouble at all, Auntie Jen.

45
00:04:40,785 --> 00:04:41,689
As a friend—

46
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:43,329
So you two are on the same team now?

47
00:04:44,935 --> 00:04:45,664
No, ma’am.

48
00:04:45,664 --> 00:04:46,966
Please continue, Auntie Jen.

49
00:04:46,966 --> 00:04:48,097
Hey, Jinn!

50
00:04:50,471 --> 00:04:51,949
Dad, help me please.

51
00:04:51,949 --> 00:04:53,434
I’m with your mom on this.

52
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:57,456
What you did today was
extremely dangerous, you know?

53
00:04:57,902 --> 00:05:01,937
Your wrist hasn’t fully healed
and you haven’t driven in a while.

54
00:05:02,317 --> 00:05:04,054
How could you
get back on the racetrack like that?

55
00:05:04,232 --> 00:05:07,311
Your punishment is
car confiscation indefinitely,

56
00:05:08,849 --> 00:05:10,961
and a 2,000-baht deduction
from your monthly allowance.

57
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:11,973
Holy shit!

58
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:17,336
Sorry, that was supposed to stay in my head.

59
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,342
I’m gonna…

60
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,611
go to bed.

61
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:21,969
I’m so sleepy. Goodnight.

62
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,370
Jinn, stay with me.

63
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,154
No one can help you.

64
00:05:27,982 --> 00:05:30,180
I’m sorry. It’s my fault.

65
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:41,175
Who are you, ma’am?

66
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,842
What are you doing in my house?

67
00:05:44,938 --> 00:05:49,086
Come on. Stop sulking already.

68
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:51,791
Want a slice of apple?

69
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:54,146
Ah…

70
00:05:56,019 --> 00:05:57,996
There you go. Good?

71
00:05:57,996 --> 00:05:59,873
Why are you making that face?

72
00:05:59,873 --> 00:06:01,091
It’s so sour.

73
00:06:01,225 --> 00:06:02,237
So where exactly did you go?

74
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:05,205
I told you, I had errands to run.

75
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:07,189
Errands or a trip?

76
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,230
Why am I hearing two different stories?

77
00:06:11,415 --> 00:06:12,858
I did run errands first.

78
00:06:12,969 --> 00:06:15,391
But then I finished early,

79
00:06:15,391 --> 00:06:16,514
so I went on a trip afterward.

80
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,609
That sounds suspicious.

81
00:06:19,214 --> 00:06:20,775
Suspicious how?

82
00:06:24,164 --> 00:06:28,544
When you stay at the condo and leave me
alone in this house for months, I don’t sulk.

83
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:31,433
I just went on a short trip with friends.

84
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,544
Stop being upset already.

85
00:06:33,834 --> 00:06:34,446
Yeah?

86
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,757
Yeah?

87
00:06:39,544 --> 00:06:40,742
I was worried about you.

88
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:42,463
I love you.

89
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,403
I don’t want anyone
messing around with you.

90
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:48,250
Alright, alright. I love you too, son.

91
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,451
You’re the only one I have,
and I love you the most.

92
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,363
Hm? Don’t sulk.

93
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:55,133
Are you having a secret boyfriend or what?

94
00:06:56,203 --> 00:06:57,093
No!

95
00:06:57,093 --> 00:06:58,049
Not the high pitch.

96
00:06:58,049 --> 00:06:59,006
No.

97
00:06:59,274 --> 00:07:00,137
Your eyes are twitching.

98
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:02,355
Mom!

99
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:05,147
What? They’re not twitching.

100
00:07:05,147 --> 00:07:05,986
They’re not.

101
00:07:05,986 --> 00:07:07,335
No secret boyfriend.

102
00:07:07,335 --> 00:07:08,250
This is so fishy.

103
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,577
I can’t sleep.

104
00:08:01,141 --> 00:08:01,872
What?

105
00:08:02,964 --> 00:08:03,674
I.

106
00:08:03,674 --> 00:08:04,321
Can’t.

107
00:08:04,321 --> 00:08:04,857
Sleep.

108
00:08:06,306 --> 00:08:07,841
What am I supposed to do?

109
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:12,405
I want to cuddle my boyfriend.

110
00:08:31,179 --> 00:08:33,698
Didn’t I tell you to call me
if you were drunk so I could pick you up?

111
00:08:34,902 --> 00:08:35,573
Mm.

112
00:08:35,573 --> 00:08:36,676
Mm what?

113
00:08:36,921 --> 00:08:38,227
You’re not making any sense.

114
00:08:38,762 --> 00:08:39,520
Just go to bed.

115
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,429
Why didn’t you call?

116
00:08:47,691 --> 00:08:48,480
Just walk.

117
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:56,107
You can’t sleep and
you come bother someone else, huh?

118
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,202
You’re not “someone else.”

119
00:09:01,202 --> 00:09:02,072
You’re my boyfriend.

120
00:09:08,538 --> 00:09:09,276
Sorry.

121
00:09:18,208 --> 00:09:19,308
Are you alright?

122
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:23,217
I’m just not used to this.

123
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,883
But we lived together
at your place for a month.

124
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:31,815
Yeah, but we weren’t together as boyfriends.

125
00:09:34,245 --> 00:09:39,640
You’ve seen us in your dreams or visions
or whatever, so you understand everything.

126
00:09:40,844 --> 00:09:41,896
But don’t forget…

127
00:09:43,345 --> 00:09:48,320
for me, yesterday we still hated each other.

128
00:09:50,817 --> 00:09:52,344
If I make you uncomfortable,

129
00:09:53,236 --> 00:09:54,558
I can go back home.

130
00:09:56,386 --> 00:09:57,628
That’s not it.

131
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:04,645
I don’t know.

132
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,598
I honestly don’t.

133
00:10:14,491 --> 00:10:17,052
You’re not wrong to feel confused.

134
00:10:26,623 --> 00:10:31,356
It almost cost my life to understand all of this.

135
00:10:33,608 --> 00:10:37,293
So I’ll give you all the time you need.

136
00:10:39,768 --> 00:10:42,255
I won’t rush you or pressure you in any way.

137
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,189
And if, in the end,

138
00:10:49,196 --> 00:10:53,406
we don’t end up loving
each other like in the future I saw,

139
00:10:57,999 --> 00:10:59,206
I’ll accept that.

140
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,774
J…

141
00:11:00,975 --> 00:11:06,280
Because at least we’ll end up on good terms.

142
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:09,292
We won’t spend our lives hating each other.

143
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:32,695
I got this.

144
00:11:40,721 --> 00:11:41,979
How did you even get back here?

145
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,200
Let me think…

146
00:11:50,952 --> 00:11:51,646
Van?

147
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:52,734
Jeez.

148
00:11:56,577 --> 00:11:58,183
You’re acting like my boyfriend.

149
00:11:59,298 --> 00:12:01,831
What if I actually like you for real?

150
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,331
What will I do?

151
00:12:07,385 --> 00:12:08,374
I’m just worried.

152
00:12:08,998 --> 00:12:10,983
I was afraid you’d get kicked around again.

153
00:12:14,572 --> 00:12:18,576
I was gonna call you, actually, but…

154
00:12:20,047 --> 00:12:21,624
Ta-da!

155
00:12:22,605 --> 00:12:23,318
Shit.

156
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:50,716
- Jinn.
- J.

157
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:53,886
You go first.

158
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:57,680
I just wanted to say goodnight.

159
00:13:06,768 --> 00:13:07,638
What about you?

160
00:13:07,638 --> 00:13:08,697
Why did you call me?

161
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:14,543
I want to know about your dreams.

162
00:13:16,126 --> 00:13:18,368
What are they like? The things you see?

163
00:13:18,613 --> 00:13:19,787
Is it like in the movies?

164
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:24,942
Do you sense it
when something’s about to happen?

165
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:26,706
How does it work?

166
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,908
They’re like normal dreams.

167
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:32,290
There are images and voices.

168
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,971
What’s weird is…

169
00:13:36,911 --> 00:13:38,645
most of them end up happening for real.

170
00:13:44,798 --> 00:13:47,598
What about when
you saved me from that bike?

171
00:13:53,216 --> 00:13:57,187
Did you see that exact scene in your dream?

172
00:14:11,466 --> 00:14:12,110
J!

173
00:14:12,467 --> 00:14:13,869
Did you change the future?

174
00:14:22,602 --> 00:14:23,749
What’s bothering you?

175
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:28,237
From what I’ve seen in the movies,

176
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,329
when you decide to change something,

177
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:36,873
it affects the future. Right?

178
00:14:44,966 --> 00:14:46,391
But this isn’t a movie.

179
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,683
This is our life.

180
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,155
Look at it another way.

181
00:14:55,337 --> 00:14:58,409
If I were the one getting hit by that bike,

182
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,510
you would’ve done the same thing.

183
00:15:15,678 --> 00:15:16,608
Don’t overthink it.

184
00:15:17,611 --> 00:15:18,562
Get some sleep.

185
00:15:39,516 --> 00:15:40,856
Can I help with anything?

186
00:15:41,324 --> 00:15:42,963
I’ll put this on the table, Mom.

187
00:15:42,963 --> 00:15:43,463
Sure.

188
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:11,635
Hey.

189
00:16:12,011 --> 00:16:13,275
Morning, Gorgeous.

190
00:16:13,275 --> 00:16:13,962
Hey.

191
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,134
Did you sleep here last night, J?

192
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:19,262
That’s right.

193
00:16:19,262 --> 00:16:20,693
My AC broke.

194
00:16:21,716 --> 00:16:22,248
Alright.

195
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,696
I just finished making breakfast.

196
00:16:24,696 --> 00:16:25,688
Stay and eat with us.

197
00:16:28,064 --> 00:16:29,483
Can I help with anything?

198
00:16:30,761 --> 00:16:32,380
I’ll put this on the table, Mom.

199
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:32,880
Sure.

200
00:16:40,055 --> 00:16:42,174
What did you call me just now, J?

201
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,358
That came out wrong, Auntie Jan.

202
00:16:45,523 --> 00:16:47,614
I’ll take these two glasses too.

203
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:48,840
Sure.

204
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,235
- Mom!
- Jeez!

205
00:17:02,686 --> 00:17:03,443
What?!

206
00:17:03,443 --> 00:17:04,307
What are you doing?

207
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:06,951
You’re staring.

208
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,245
A little more.

209
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:15,491
Hey, sit down.

210
00:17:17,326 --> 00:17:18,805
J, is your hand fully healed?

211
00:17:20,189 --> 00:17:21,354
Yes, Auntie Jan.

212
00:17:22,016 --> 00:17:24,650
The doctor said I can
go back to my normal routine.

213
00:17:24,966 --> 00:17:26,573
But I’m still not allowed to drive.

214
00:17:26,949 --> 00:17:29,632
Then you can use
Jinn’s driving service for now.

215
00:17:29,843 --> 00:17:30,783
He’s all yours.

216
00:17:33,204 --> 00:17:34,158
Can I?

217
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:36,372
Pay half the gas bill.

218
00:17:42,658 --> 00:17:47,123
I’m happy you guys are close.

219
00:17:47,505 --> 00:17:48,523
I’m happy too.

220
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:51,699
Right?

221
00:17:55,685 --> 00:17:56,428
Just eat.

222
00:18:11,148 --> 00:18:12,567
Gosh, this is torture.

223
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:16,592
Remember this feeling.

224
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:19,996
Remind yourself before
you put alcohol in your mouth again.

225
00:18:23,786 --> 00:18:25,159
My head’s exploding.

226
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:26,863
Are you sure you’re okay?

227
00:18:27,254 --> 00:18:28,180
I’m good.

228
00:18:28,752 --> 00:18:30,410
You can just skip today.

229
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,126
It’s fine.

230
00:18:32,074 --> 00:18:35,914
If I can lift a glass, I can turn book pages.

231
00:18:41,866 --> 00:18:42,366
Here.

232
00:18:43,494 --> 00:18:44,996
It’s my old phone.

233
00:18:45,176 --> 00:18:46,341
Your SIM card’s already in it.

234
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:47,740
Use this for now.

235
00:18:48,718 --> 00:18:49,466
Where’s my phone?

236
00:18:49,812 --> 00:18:52,008
Shithead, don’t you remember anything?

237
00:18:52,685 --> 00:18:54,648
Your phone’s completely cracked.

238
00:18:54,844 --> 00:18:56,684
I put it in the bedside drawer.

239
00:18:56,925 --> 00:18:59,195
Restore your data when you get the time.

240
00:19:00,143 --> 00:19:00,728
It’s all good.

241
00:19:01,074 --> 00:19:02,396
Nothing important in there anyway.

242
00:19:03,735 --> 00:19:05,863
Not even something you want to keep?

243
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:07,950
You know me.

244
00:19:08,055 --> 00:19:09,941
Nothing in my life is memorable.

245
00:19:15,507 --> 00:19:16,905
- Hey.
- Hm?

246
00:19:17,131 --> 00:19:19,039
- I’m finally free this Saturday.
- Um-hum.

247
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,049
I can go with you now.

248
00:19:22,982 --> 00:19:24,458
I thought I’d just sneak out by myself.

249
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,173
You’ve got an excellent memory.

250
00:19:28,323 --> 00:19:29,865
You don’t want me to come along anymore?

251
00:19:30,407 --> 00:19:31,423
Hey, it’s not that.

252
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:36,512
I planned to gossip about you to my parents.

253
00:19:38,031 --> 00:19:39,716
If you come, I won’t get to say everything.

254
00:19:42,423 --> 00:19:43,762
- Van.
- Hm?

255
00:19:44,168 --> 00:19:47,782
You can put on that tough-guy act
or that reckless act with anyone.

256
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:51,790
But with me, you don’t have to.

257
00:19:58,954 --> 00:20:00,601
Eat, so we can get to class on time.

258
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,889
I’m gonna take a quick nap.

259
00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:05,730
I can’t keep going.

260
00:20:17,668 --> 00:20:18,303
Here they are.

261
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:19,152
What’s up?

262
00:20:19,588 --> 00:20:20,624
What kind of trouble
did you get into this time?

263
00:20:21,226 --> 00:20:22,426
News travels fast.

264
00:20:23,328 --> 00:20:24,216
So, how did it go?

265
00:20:26,999 --> 00:20:28,846
I didn’t see anything last night.

266
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,165
Farm knows about this?

267
00:20:36,572 --> 00:20:37,593
You already told Jinn?

268
00:20:41,046 --> 00:20:41,967
Hold on.

269
00:20:42,719 --> 00:20:46,858
Do any of you care to
share anything with us?

270
00:20:47,505 --> 00:20:48,043
Hm?

271
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:01,854
What are you doing?

272
00:21:04,802 --> 00:21:06,598
Looks like someone doesn’t plan
on going home anytime soon.

273
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,667
So I’m clearing half the space for you.

274
00:21:10,216 --> 00:21:12,101
If you want me to stay, just say so.

275
00:21:12,251 --> 00:21:14,245
Don’t make excuses.

276
00:21:15,328 --> 00:21:16,908
You asshole.

277
00:21:17,164 --> 00:21:17,807
Just go home.

278
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:19,863
I’m kidding. Come on.

279
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:23,802
You’re not staying for free, though.

280
00:21:24,163 --> 00:21:26,141
Everything is split half-half.

281
00:21:27,505 --> 00:21:29,124
Come on, my allowance is being cut.

282
00:21:30,146 --> 00:21:31,211
Have some mercy.

283
00:21:31,587 --> 00:21:34,082
Um… no.

284
00:21:43,714 --> 00:21:44,368
Are you throwing it away?

285
00:21:46,684 --> 00:21:47,197
Yeah.

286
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:48,465
Why?

287
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:51,762
It’s just me ranting about you.

288
00:21:52,138 --> 00:21:53,061
Why keep it?

289
00:21:53,317 --> 00:21:55,772
But you also confessed you love me in here.

290
00:21:56,464 --> 00:21:57,165
Can I keep it?

291
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,029
There are still plenty of blank pages.

292
00:22:05,067 --> 00:22:07,035
Can I write on the other half?

293
00:22:07,892 --> 00:22:09,578
What? What are you gonna write?

294
00:22:14,963 --> 00:22:16,096
My love for you.

295
00:22:18,874 --> 00:22:19,840
Just buy a new notebook.

296
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:25,473
You’re really gonna write love notes
in a book where half of it is insults?

297
00:22:25,804 --> 00:22:26,909
Not to mention the cover is black.

298
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,368
Isn’t that bad luck?

299
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:33,871
But your feelings are in here.

300
00:22:34,984 --> 00:22:35,884
Let me keep it.

301
00:22:38,952 --> 00:22:40,213
Fine. Suit yourself.

302
00:22:40,604 --> 00:22:41,187
Do whatever you want.

303
00:22:57,433 --> 00:23:00,460
Whatever problems you have,
you can come talk to me, Van.

304
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,820
You’re already like the other half of my life.

305
00:23:20,949 --> 00:23:21,980
It’s been five years.

306
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,484
Time really flies.

307
00:23:25,975 --> 00:23:26,640
Oh, by the way,

308
00:23:27,457 --> 00:23:29,213
I’m staying at Farm’s place now.

309
00:23:30,622 --> 00:23:31,906
He’s here today too,

310
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:33,810
so our gossip won’t be as fun.

311
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,323
You’ve been telling your parents about me?

312
00:23:39,773 --> 00:23:41,387
Your secrets are all out.

313
00:23:42,122 --> 00:23:43,711
Be nice.

314
00:23:44,262 --> 00:23:47,269
If you’re mean to me,
I’ll tell Mom and Dad to haunt you.

315
00:23:48,147 --> 00:23:48,873
Remember his face.

316
00:23:54,162 --> 00:23:56,156
Hello. I’m Farm.

317
00:23:56,156 --> 00:23:57,964
The one Van’s been telling you about.

318
00:23:58,638 --> 00:23:59,809
Don’t worry about him.

319
00:24:00,687 --> 00:24:02,999
He might live a stupid life sometimes, but…

320
00:24:03,162 --> 00:24:04,227
I’ll help take care of him.

321
00:24:17,656 --> 00:24:19,257
Do you come here often?

322
00:24:21,381 --> 00:24:23,162
On their anniversary.

323
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:26,024
Or when I’m down.

324
00:24:28,413 --> 00:24:29,240
Not that often, though.

325
00:24:33,651 --> 00:24:37,295
When you feel low,
do you always talk to them?

326
00:24:39,623 --> 00:24:42,117
Yeah. I just want a place to vent.

327
00:24:43,689 --> 00:24:47,284
Is it okay to talk when no one answers back?

328
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,114
Sometimes, I don’t want comfort
or anyone stepping into my problems.

329
00:24:51,788 --> 00:24:53,356
I just want to let it out.

330
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,240
Whatever problems you have,
you can come talk to me, Van.

331
00:25:00,873 --> 00:25:03,277
And if you just want me to listen,
I can do that too.

332
00:25:03,992 --> 00:25:06,232
You’re already like the other half of my life.

333
00:25:06,457 --> 00:25:07,412
What more do you want?

334
00:25:16,164 --> 00:25:17,683
Van, it stinks!

335
00:25:18,663 --> 00:25:19,970
Van!

336
00:25:39,132 --> 00:25:41,125
Seriously, you can just tell me anything.

337
00:25:42,432 --> 00:25:45,864
But you don’t tell me everything.

338
00:25:47,661 --> 00:25:48,579
What are you talking about?

339
00:25:51,785 --> 00:25:52,720
Never mind.

340
00:25:53,128 --> 00:25:54,302
We can just go on like this.

341
00:25:59,857 --> 00:26:00,527
Should we head back?

342
00:26:01,201 --> 00:26:02,067
Or is there somewhere else you want to go?

343
00:26:02,475 --> 00:26:03,238
Should we eat first?

344
00:26:03,565 --> 00:26:04,337
I’m buying.

345
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:05,435
Why?

346
00:26:06,027 --> 00:26:10,172
Because Dad and Mom
left me plenty of money.

347
00:26:10,621 --> 00:26:15,118
And I can feel
they want you to help me spend it.

348
00:26:17,732 --> 00:26:22,474
Then I should thank
your mom and dad for the meal.

349
00:26:22,474 --> 00:26:23,620
Not you.

350
00:26:24,865 --> 00:26:26,245
How about you eat this?

351
00:26:26,735 --> 00:26:27,486
Don’t.

352
00:26:28,139 --> 00:26:29,691
Come on. Let’s go get something.

353
00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:49,137
I’m going to my mom’s boutique.

354
00:26:50,587 --> 00:26:51,251
What for?

355
00:26:51,537 --> 00:26:53,041
I usually hang out
in the secret room on my days off.

356
00:26:54,328 --> 00:26:55,102
You want to come?

357
00:26:56,613 --> 00:26:57,253
I do.

358
00:26:57,319 --> 00:26:58,477
Give me ten minutes to change.

359
00:26:58,477 --> 00:27:00,504
You’re like a dog
that just heard it’s getting a walk.

360
00:27:03,077 --> 00:27:03,776
Hey.

361
00:27:04,899 --> 00:27:05,949
J, you asshole.

362
00:27:23,015 --> 00:27:23,811
What are you looking at?

363
00:27:26,262 --> 00:27:28,663
You told my parents you’d take care of me.

364
00:27:29,419 --> 00:27:30,128
What did you mean?

365
00:27:32,048 --> 00:27:33,738
Don’t I already do that?

366
00:27:34,199 --> 00:27:35,486
That’s not what I mean.

367
00:27:35,833 --> 00:27:36,884
I mean…

368
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,525
You mean what?

369
00:27:43,547 --> 00:27:45,061
How long are you
planning to keep doing this?

370
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:50,983
I guess, until someone comes along
and takes care of you instead of me.

371
00:27:52,964 --> 00:27:56,018
What if… no one does?

372
00:27:57,202 --> 00:27:58,094
Someone will.

373
00:27:58,237 --> 00:27:59,954
Don’t you want to take care of me forever?

374
00:28:03,855 --> 00:28:05,309
Do you want me to?

375
00:28:06,841 --> 00:28:09,144
You and I are just built the same.

376
00:28:09,532 --> 00:28:10,870
We step forward, then back.

377
00:28:11,176 --> 00:28:12,451
Forward, then back.

378
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,177
Over and over.

379
00:28:14,606 --> 00:28:15,252
No.

380
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:18,393
I’ll stand still.

381
00:28:18,761 --> 00:28:20,048
The rest is your call.

382
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:34,737
What are you doing?

383
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,847
Eating.

384
00:28:57,387 --> 00:28:58,305
- Boo!
- Oops!

385
00:28:58,636 --> 00:28:59,931
I missed you.

386
00:29:01,994 --> 00:29:04,197
- Hello, Auntie Jan.
- Hi, dear.

387
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:11,319
Whose suit is this, Mom?

388
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:13,311
Uh…

389
00:29:15,169 --> 00:29:16,627
It’s a mock-up for the new collection.

390
00:29:21,141 --> 00:29:23,598
So you’re making men’s clothing
for this collection?

391
00:29:29,051 --> 00:29:33,079
Look at you. You look so handsome.

392
00:29:33,385 --> 00:29:36,054
Mom, don’t state the obvious.

393
00:29:36,953 --> 00:29:38,788
You look like your dad when he was young.

394
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:43,973
Why are you bringing him up?

395
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:53,214
Aren’t you glad
you look like a national superstar?

396
00:29:54,051 --> 00:29:54,788
No.

397
00:29:56,932 --> 00:29:59,272
You’re my parent. I have only you.

398
00:30:03,193 --> 00:30:04,306
Mm.

399
00:30:04,878 --> 00:30:05,914
I’m just teasing.

400
00:30:06,731 --> 00:30:08,784
Sorry, honey.

401
00:30:10,377 --> 00:30:12,235
Let’s not fight, okay?

402
00:30:13,767 --> 00:30:15,555
It’s just the two of us, yeah?

403
00:30:24,779 --> 00:30:26,098
Mom, he left us!

404
00:30:29,978 --> 00:30:31,359
How come you forgot that so easily?

405
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:36,761
Let me make it up to you, son.

406
00:30:36,761 --> 00:30:37,873
You’re not my dad!

407
00:30:37,873 --> 00:30:38,600
Jinn.

408
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,334
And I’m not your son!

409
00:30:39,334 --> 00:30:40,218
- J.
- Jinn!

410
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:44,438
What?

411
00:30:44,949 --> 00:30:46,665
J, are you okay, dear?

412
00:30:47,482 --> 00:30:48,442
Are you feeling unwell?

413
00:30:50,157 --> 00:30:50,884
I’m fine, Auntie.

414
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:52,601
What did you say?

415
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:53,862
I asked if you wanted to go upstairs.

416
00:30:56,149 --> 00:30:57,968
Ah, sure.

417
00:30:58,213 --> 00:31:00,099
You two go hang out upstairs.

418
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:01,509
I’ll order some snacks for you.

419
00:31:12,073 --> 00:31:14,374
So you like spending time
here on your days off?

420
00:31:16,498 --> 00:31:17,196
Mm.

421
00:31:18,503 --> 00:31:20,343
I come to see Mom
and do little things here and there.

422
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:28,827
Are all these dresses your designs?

423
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:30,995
Yes.

424
00:31:32,302 --> 00:31:33,453
Just to pass the time.

425
00:31:34,495 --> 00:31:36,210
I want to be near my mom,

426
00:31:36,598 --> 00:31:38,856
but I don’t want to deal with customers.

427
00:31:41,123 --> 00:31:42,358
So you hide in here?

428
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:46,060
Mm. Mom gave me this room.

429
00:31:47,857 --> 00:31:50,960
Besides clothes, do you make anything else?

430
00:31:51,613 --> 00:31:53,645
Anything with fabric.

431
00:31:54,462 --> 00:31:58,417
Hats, bags, even tablecloths.

432
00:31:59,561 --> 00:32:00,869
What are you making today?

433
00:32:02,176 --> 00:32:03,121
What do you want?

434
00:32:03,427 --> 00:32:04,274
I can make it for you.

435
00:32:33,463 --> 00:32:34,327
Your father…

436
00:32:38,207 --> 00:32:39,921
You think you’ll ever be able to forgive him?

437
00:32:44,434 --> 00:32:45,368
Why are you asking?

438
00:32:49,013 --> 00:32:50,453
Just wondering.

439
00:32:53,067 --> 00:32:54,385
Did you see a vision of him coming back?

440
00:32:55,753 --> 00:32:56,668
No.

441
00:32:57,587 --> 00:32:58,382
It’s not that.

442
00:33:00,751 --> 00:33:03,643
If you didn’t, then don’t ask me that again.

443
00:33:04,378 --> 00:33:06,865
We cut ties the day
he told me not to call him Dad.

444
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:09,554
Let me know if you need anything, Jan.

445
00:33:09,881 --> 00:33:10,665
Go on.

446
00:33:11,564 --> 00:33:12,827
Where are you going, Dad?

447
00:33:13,746 --> 00:33:15,174
Do you want this uncle to be your dad?

448
00:33:17,277 --> 00:33:18,409
I’m not your father.

449
00:33:18,817 --> 00:33:20,126
I can’t be.

450
00:33:21,576 --> 00:33:22,464
Dad!

451
00:33:22,759 --> 00:33:23,812
- Jinn.
- Dad!

452
00:33:46,697 --> 00:33:48,043
Waking up early is pretty nice.

453
00:33:48,247 --> 00:33:49,428
We get a lot done.

454
00:33:50,347 --> 00:33:51,819
And we still have half the day left.

455
00:33:52,554 --> 00:33:53,989
Aren’t you going out tonight?

456
00:33:54,316 --> 00:33:55,679
My liver is on a break.

457
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:56,406
Is it?

458
00:33:57,141 --> 00:33:59,195
I didn’t know you could be sensible.

459
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:03,350
What will you do this evening?

460
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:05,271
Why do you ask?

461
00:35:10,455 --> 00:35:11,121
J.

462
00:35:52,637 --> 00:35:55,456
(I like it when you focus. It’s cute.)

463
00:36:17,822 --> 00:36:20,462
I shouldn’t have wondered
what you were doing this evening.

464
00:36:21,851 --> 00:36:25,501
Not everyone gets to
sleep in my son’s secret room.

465
00:36:42,856 --> 00:36:44,789
Just in time for dinner.

466
00:36:45,409 --> 00:36:46,293
Where’s J?

467
00:36:47,127 --> 00:36:48,451
He’s asleep.

468
00:36:50,954 --> 00:36:52,551
I’m envious.

469
00:36:52,551 --> 00:36:56,224
Not everyone gets to
sleep in my son’s secret room.

470
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,829
What are you saying?

471
00:37:01,936 --> 00:37:03,437
Well, it’s true.

472
00:37:03,437 --> 00:37:06,313
Even I need your permission to go in there.

473
00:37:06,313 --> 00:37:09,026
So yes, not just anyone can be in that room.

474
00:37:10,117 --> 00:37:11,276
He’s my friend, Mom.

475
00:37:11,554 --> 00:37:13,843
If Farm, Van, or Mai came over,

476
00:37:14,742 --> 00:37:15,996
they could be in there too.

477
00:37:18,756 --> 00:37:19,465
Come on.

478
00:37:19,731 --> 00:37:20,411
Alright.

479
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:24,242
How did you two become so close, though?

480
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,408
Because you lived together?

481
00:37:26,392 --> 00:37:27,357
Kind of, Mom.

482
00:37:27,785 --> 00:37:29,351
And he’s not a bad person.

483
00:37:30,742 --> 00:37:33,587
If I’d known, I would’ve forced you two
to live together since the 7th grade.

484
00:37:34,122 --> 00:37:35,204
Gosh.

485
00:37:35,782 --> 00:37:38,659
Seriously, why do you
want us to be close so badly?

486
00:37:40,285 --> 00:37:41,795
His house is right across the street.

487
00:37:41,795 --> 00:37:43,808
His mom is my close friend.
You’re studying the same major.

488
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,513
What’s the reason not to be close?

489
00:38:09,624 --> 00:38:13,630
(Thanks. But if you’ve got guts,
say it to my face, chicken.)

490
00:38:22,959 --> 00:38:23,764
You should’ve cleaned this up.

491
00:38:24,491 --> 00:38:25,146
What?

492
00:38:25,731 --> 00:38:27,926
Hey, you’re awake.

493
00:38:28,482 --> 00:38:29,763
Let’s eat, dear.

494
00:38:29,934 --> 00:38:30,907
Yes, Auntie Jan.

495
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:34,712
Eat.

496
00:38:37,878 --> 00:38:42,795
So, are you going back home
or back to your condo tonight?

497
00:38:44,827 --> 00:38:45,896
What do you want?

498
00:38:46,902 --> 00:38:47,816
Why are you asking me?

499
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,092
It’s up to you.

500
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:53,274
I’ll just go back to the condo.

501
00:38:54,964 --> 00:38:56,575
Leaving me alone in the house again?

502
00:38:56,575 --> 00:38:58,139
I guess it’s my turn to sulk.

503
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:00,446
Come on, I left my unfinished project there.

504
00:39:00,446 --> 00:39:02,039
I need to submit it on Monday.

505
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:05,079
I’m only joking.

506
00:39:05,699 --> 00:39:08,773
It’s all good. I’m used to being alone.

507
00:39:08,773 --> 00:39:10,891
Hey, don’t say that.

508
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:16,932
What’s the matter?

509
00:39:18,686 --> 00:39:19,835
Nothing.

510
00:39:19,835 --> 00:39:22,117
Here, son. Eat up.

511
00:39:22,117 --> 00:39:22,855
Thank you.

512
00:39:22,983 --> 00:39:24,343
To make it up to you,

513
00:39:24,343 --> 00:39:27,247
I’ll clean up and close the boutique for you.

514
00:39:27,247 --> 00:39:27,964
How’s that?

515
00:39:29,462 --> 00:39:31,572
Can you do the dishes too?

516
00:39:33,284 --> 00:39:35,895
Don’t think so.

517
00:39:38,163 --> 00:39:38,841
Alright, fine.

518
00:39:51,796 --> 00:39:52,956
What’s with that face?

519
00:39:56,208 --> 00:39:59,760
Why did I have to help you
make it up to your mom?

520
00:40:00,209 --> 00:40:01,312
Stop complaining.

521
00:40:01,419 --> 00:40:02,848
It’s just a clean-up.

522
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,762
Not “just.”

523
00:40:05,896 --> 00:40:10,503
We swept, mopped,
wiped the racks, and dusted everything.

524
00:40:10,931 --> 00:40:13,137
I almost died, you know?

525
00:40:13,971 --> 00:40:15,209
Stop stalling. Get up.

526
00:40:45,699 --> 00:40:46,798
What?

527
00:40:48,595 --> 00:40:50,634
It’s something I promised to make for you.

528
00:41:01,217 --> 00:41:01,971
Well?

529
00:41:03,084 --> 00:41:04,159
Am I cute?

530
00:41:05,678 --> 00:41:06,582
Not really.

531
00:41:07,502 --> 00:41:10,033
Am I really not cute?

532
00:41:11,017 --> 00:41:12,107
No.

533
00:41:18,525 --> 00:41:20,992
But you are cute.

534
00:41:24,531 --> 00:41:26,342
You said I should
compliment you face-to-face.

535
00:41:27,262 --> 00:41:28,639
Here I am, doing just that.

536
00:41:31,591 --> 00:41:33,904
Nong Jinn, you’re so cute.

537
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:34,896
J!

538
00:41:35,773 --> 00:41:37,523
You’re dead. Don’t run.

539
00:41:47,016 --> 00:41:49,333
I shouldn’t have wondered
what you were doing this evening.

540
00:41:50,916 --> 00:41:51,894
Too late now.

541
00:41:53,285 --> 00:41:54,715
Will you excuse me?

542
00:41:54,715 --> 00:41:56,414
No!

543
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,612
If you’re gonna stick with me,
you have to stay fit.

544
00:42:01,131 --> 00:42:02,016
Sit down.

545
00:42:02,786 --> 00:42:05,117
Why do you have to force me?

546
00:42:07,201 --> 00:42:09,255
Who taught you to wear sandals to the gym?

547
00:42:09,768 --> 00:42:10,869
Well, I didn’t know.

548
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:12,495
Why didn’t you tell me
you were coming here?

549
00:42:15,447 --> 00:42:16,682
You’re all set.

550
00:42:26,971 --> 00:42:28,545
How thoughtful of you.

551
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:31,918
As if I love this so much.

552
00:42:32,346 --> 00:42:33,765
Gosh.

553
00:42:34,022 --> 00:42:35,177
It’s just exercise.

554
00:42:35,412 --> 00:42:37,044
Don’t act like you’re dying.

555
00:42:38,157 --> 00:42:39,842
Go easy on me.

556
00:42:39,842 --> 00:42:41,718
Just put them on. Hurry.

557
00:42:49,364 --> 00:42:50,570
Here. Lift this.

558
00:42:51,091 --> 00:42:52,384
Easy.

559
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:54,866
Shit.

560
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:09,057
One more.

561
00:43:13,413 --> 00:43:14,712
The last time. I’m serious.

562
00:43:22,179 --> 00:43:23,295
One.

563
00:43:25,092 --> 00:43:26,506
Two.

564
00:43:39,714 --> 00:43:41,174
Please let me go.

565
00:43:41,431 --> 00:43:42,442
One more set.

566
00:43:47,651 --> 00:43:49,230
I can’t anymore.

567
00:43:59,307 --> 00:44:01,185
Where are you going, Van?

568
00:44:01,185 --> 00:44:02,513
Come back here.

569
00:44:02,791 --> 00:44:03,960
Come, my dear friend.

570
00:44:06,998 --> 00:44:09,938
Argh!

571
00:45:10,147 --> 00:45:10,796
J.

572
00:45:16,791 --> 00:45:17,672
I’m right here.

573
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:20,895
It’s okay.

574
00:45:21,901 --> 00:45:22,747
I’m here.

575
00:45:32,305 --> 00:45:32,841
Feeling better?

576
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:36,254
Mm.

577
00:45:45,298 --> 00:45:46,608
What did you see in your dream?

578
00:45:52,705 --> 00:45:53,698
I don’t remember.

579
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,559
But you never forget.

580
00:46:07,352 --> 00:46:08,047
Why?

581
00:46:08,171 --> 00:46:10,054
Was I in bad shape?

582
00:46:12,579 --> 00:46:13,685
Did I die?

583
00:46:14,198 --> 00:46:15,213
Don’t say things like that again.

584
00:46:24,838 --> 00:46:25,774
But I’m not scared

585
00:46:26,459 --> 00:46:28,855
because you’d help me in time.

586
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:34,041
Right?

587
00:46:36,437 --> 00:46:37,162
Mm.

588
00:46:44,311 --> 00:46:45,854
Let’s go to bed. I’m tired.

589
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:48,157
You go ahead.

590
00:46:52,008 --> 00:46:52,992
Are you scared you’ll dream again?

591
00:47:00,171 --> 00:47:02,659
J, why don’t you see a doctor?

592
00:47:03,729 --> 00:47:06,441
It’s not that I don’t believe you
or think you’re sick.

593
00:47:08,024 --> 00:47:10,840
I do believe you. I’m just worried.

594
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,784
Why worry about me?

595
00:47:14,266 --> 00:47:17,322
Because it keeps you from resting.

596
00:47:18,092 --> 00:47:19,427
You wake up at night.

597
00:47:19,427 --> 00:47:20,443
You don’t get proper sleep.

598
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:24,796
If you see a doctor,
maybe you’ll get meds or therapy.

599
00:47:24,989 --> 00:47:26,098
It might help.

600
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:29,519
What if going to a doctor
makes me stop seeing the visions?

601
00:47:30,653 --> 00:47:31,708
How will I help you then?

602
00:47:59,093 --> 00:47:59,712
J…

603
00:48:00,771 --> 00:48:02,592
I don’t want you to only worry about me.

604
00:48:03,897 --> 00:48:05,003
You worry about me.

605
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:07,320
I worry about your health too.

606
00:48:10,957 --> 00:48:13,337
I promise I won’t push myself too far.

607
00:48:16,225 --> 00:48:17,364
But right now, I can still handle it.

608
00:48:26,545 --> 00:48:27,662
Have you ever thought…

609
00:48:28,603 --> 00:48:31,242
what if all of this is just a coincidence?

610
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:33,851
If you’re not really seeing the future,

611
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:35,842
if we’re not boyfriends in ten years…

612
00:48:38,516 --> 00:48:39,406
what will that be?

613
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:47,474
Then I guess… it’s only my feelings

614
00:48:51,026 --> 00:48:52,520
that came true.

615
00:49:31,856 --> 00:49:32,706
What’s up with these two?

616
00:49:32,706 --> 00:49:34,203
They stick together like a married couple.

617
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:36,401
Why are you so cute?

618
00:49:36,971 --> 00:49:39,341
You’re the only one
who cares this much about me.

619
00:49:40,411 --> 00:49:41,239
Is something wrong?

620
00:49:42,116 --> 00:49:43,096
Would you like to be my boyfriend?

621
00:49:44,422 --> 00:49:45,811
Hey, Van!

622
00:49:46,581 --> 00:49:51,139
Even though I know you’ve had
a crush on me since you could walk…

623
00:49:51,139 --> 00:49:52,048
Not true.

624
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:55,235
I’m still gonna flirt with you.

625
00:49:56,069 --> 00:49:59,780
I will make you fall head over heels for me.
