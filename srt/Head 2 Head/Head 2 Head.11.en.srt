4
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,979
It feels like we’ve had
a lot to think about lately.

5
00:00:15,979 --> 00:00:18,045
And now Van and Farm are being like this.

6
00:00:19,032 --> 00:00:20,554
Can you just talk to me?

7
00:00:23,021 --> 00:00:24,026
If you’re tired, get some rest.

8
00:00:24,026 --> 00:00:25,639
Leave the rest with me.

9
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,150
You’re the one
I should be worried about the most.

10
00:00:29,078 --> 00:00:29,709
Farm.

11
00:00:29,709 --> 00:00:31,616
I don’t want you two
leaving things unresolved like this.

12
00:00:31,616 --> 00:00:33,186
Talk it out and clear the air.

13
00:00:33,186 --> 00:00:34,879
If you can go back to being friends,
that’d still be good. Right?

14
00:00:37,741 --> 00:00:38,539
What are you doing?

15
00:00:39,862 --> 00:00:40,699
Continuing.

16
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:59,900
Even when you’re asleep,

17
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,502
you still look obnoxious.

18
00:01:08,414 --> 00:01:09,281
J.

19
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,167
Mm…

20
00:01:12,746 --> 00:01:14,014
Let go of me.

21
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,066
I know you’re awake.

22
00:01:19,882 --> 00:01:22,229
So what are we
supposed to do after waking up?

23
00:01:23,197 --> 00:01:24,989
What the heck are we supposed to do?

24
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:30,493
Say “I love you” to each other.

25
00:01:33,454 --> 00:01:34,694
That’s nonsense, you idiot.

26
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,684
That hurts!

27
00:01:42,146 --> 00:01:43,149
You’re delusional.

28
00:01:44,294 --> 00:01:48,293
You want a morning kiss and an “I love you”?

29
00:01:48,293 --> 00:01:49,967
Have you been watching
too many soap operas, boy?

30
00:01:50,342 --> 00:01:52,831
Gosh, you’re so unromantic.

31
00:01:52,949 --> 00:01:53,599
What?

32
00:01:53,816 --> 00:01:56,180
Did you pick that up from some media
ten years from now in your sleep?

33
00:01:57,108 --> 00:02:00,993
I’m telling you,
ten years from now, even twenty,

34
00:02:01,131 --> 00:02:04,921
I’ll never greet you with
an “I love you” in the morning.

35
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:07,352
Just thinking about it gives me goosebumps.

36
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,330
Damn.

37
00:02:08,547 --> 00:02:12,437
But you might, though.
You might go, “Hello, Mr. Jinn.”

38
00:02:12,437 --> 00:02:13,936
“Good morning.”

39
00:02:14,094 --> 00:02:16,020
“I hope you—”

40
00:02:16,158 --> 00:02:17,235
(Do you love me?)

41
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:19,067
(Yes.)

42
00:02:20,843 --> 00:02:21,632
(You love who?)

43
00:02:22,737 --> 00:02:24,201
(I love you, J.)

44
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,548
Asshole!

45
00:02:26,785 --> 00:02:27,901
Go back to your house and take a shower.

46
00:02:28,158 --> 00:02:30,000
If you’re not standing
in front of my house in 30 minutes,

47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,800
I’m seriously leaving you behind.

48
00:02:32,241 --> 00:02:32,932
Yes, sir.

49
00:02:32,932 --> 00:02:34,143
Yes sir, my ass. Just go.

50
00:02:40,306 --> 00:02:41,652
I love you too, Jinn.

51
00:02:41,652 --> 00:02:42,936
Leave already!

52
00:05:17,502 --> 00:05:19,029
If you’d come out and yelled at me,

53
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:20,468
it would’ve hurt less.

54
00:05:28,476 --> 00:05:31,948
Am I being punished by your mercy?

55
00:05:54,861 --> 00:05:56,108
Auntie Jan.

56
00:05:57,036 --> 00:05:57,958
Auntie Jan.

57
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,516
Jinn, wake up!

58
00:05:59,753 --> 00:06:03,220
(Don’t look for me.
I’ll live my life somewhere.)

59
00:06:03,575 --> 00:06:06,293
(One day, I’ll come back. — Jinn)

60
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:11,705
I love you, Jerome.

61
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:15,912
J!

62
00:06:18,614 --> 00:06:19,547
Hey, jackass.

63
00:06:24,955 --> 00:06:26,236
If you’re done, come down.

64
00:06:26,572 --> 00:06:27,399
Traffic’s getting bad.

65
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:29,376
I’m coming down now.

66
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:31,408
I’ll start the car.

67
00:06:33,046 --> 00:06:35,598
Give me ten minutes. I’ll be right there.

68
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,500
Mm.

69
00:07:26,021 --> 00:07:26,784
Shit!

70
00:07:26,784 --> 00:07:28,063
Just in time.

71
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:30,673
So, where did you crash last night?

72
00:07:31,482 --> 00:07:32,245
At home.

73
00:07:32,975 --> 00:07:33,640
Home?

74
00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:35,479
Whose home?

75
00:07:36,351 --> 00:07:37,316
My home, obviously.

76
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:39,732
I went back, took a shower, and changed.

77
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:41,026
That’s why I got here late.

78
00:07:41,026 --> 00:07:42,690
Traffic was horrible.

79
00:07:43,618 --> 00:07:45,064
Didn’t know you were capable of
sleeping at your own place.

80
00:07:45,775 --> 00:07:48,489
Dude, you expect me to
sleep on the street or something?

81
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:53,203
Someone like you could call any of
your exes at random and get a place to stay.

82
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:10,022
I really can’t stop running my mouth.

83
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:14,278
I don’t dare do that
kind of shit to anyone anymore.

84
00:08:29,702 --> 00:08:31,147
J and I are heading home today.

85
00:08:31,404 --> 00:08:33,243
Do you want to stay at my condo?

86
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:34,775
I can give you the key.

87
00:08:35,505 --> 00:08:38,148
It’s okay. I think I’ll stay here
and work on this for a while.

88
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,142
Then where are you sleeping tonight?

89
00:08:40,635 --> 00:08:41,738
Isn’t your house far?

90
00:08:42,725 --> 00:08:43,986
We have an early class tomorrow.

91
00:08:53,388 --> 00:08:55,287
Why don’t you find some time
to sort things out with him?

92
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,508
Doesn’t it feel uncomfortable being like this?

93
00:09:02,278 --> 00:09:04,520
I’m sorry for ruining the mood for everyone.

94
00:09:06,316 --> 00:09:08,139
Hey, don’t say that.

95
00:09:08,494 --> 00:09:11,318
We’re fine. We’re just worried about you.

96
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,710
Honestly, I want to clear things up with him.

97
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,440
I just don’t know what I want.

98
00:09:17,506 --> 00:09:18,901
Going back to being friends?

99
00:09:20,993 --> 00:09:22,161
I can’t bring myself to go that far back.

100
00:09:22,931 --> 00:09:24,118
Getting back together?

101
00:09:24,908 --> 00:09:28,994
I’m scared my bad habits will hurt him again.

102
00:09:31,007 --> 00:09:33,223
I can’t even look at him and smile right now.

103
00:09:33,934 --> 00:09:35,986
Farm is like a bubble.

104
00:09:35,986 --> 00:09:38,708
One gentle touch, and he could disappear.

105
00:09:39,813 --> 00:09:41,808
It feels like he’s always on
the verge of disappearing on me.

106
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:43,754
Van.

107
00:09:44,583 --> 00:09:47,082
You’ve been through a lot of
breakups with your exes.

108
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,025
But you know what?

109
00:09:49,617 --> 00:09:52,483
This is the first time I’ve seen you cry.

110
00:10:10,545 --> 00:10:11,553
Auntie Jan, hello.

111
00:10:11,553 --> 00:10:12,167
Hello there.

112
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:14,462
Why have you two been
coming home so often lately?

113
00:10:14,462 --> 00:10:15,022
Oops!

114
00:10:15,022 --> 00:10:16,693
We’re here to keep an eye on you.

115
00:10:16,693 --> 00:10:17,797
Just in case you’ve got
a secret lover or something.

116
00:10:19,514 --> 00:10:20,877
A secret lover?

117
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:22,462
I’m already this old. Who would want me?

118
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:25,191
I wish you really were old and wrinkly.

119
00:10:25,349 --> 00:10:26,522
But look at you.

120
00:10:26,522 --> 00:10:29,314
You’re more beautiful every day.
How could I not be possessive?

121
00:10:29,314 --> 00:10:30,800
Ouch. It hurts.

122
00:10:31,727 --> 00:10:33,945
How about this? And this?

123
00:10:34,379 --> 00:10:36,567
You’re possessive, huh?

124
00:10:37,613 --> 00:10:38,298
What?

125
00:10:38,634 --> 00:10:39,557
Can’t I kiss you anymore?

126
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:40,226
Can’t I?

127
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,581
He left us, Mom!

128
00:10:44,035 --> 00:10:45,033
Give me a chance to fix this, son.

129
00:10:45,033 --> 00:10:46,120
You’re not my dad!

130
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,986
Jinn!

131
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,452
Mom always told me not to drive too fast.

132
00:10:54,873 --> 00:10:56,459
I killed her.

133
00:10:57,722 --> 00:10:59,306
J, sweetie

134
00:10:59,405 --> 00:11:01,240
Are you staying over with Jinn tonight?

135
00:11:01,516 --> 00:11:02,730
Staying over?

136
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,623
He has his own place. He can stay there.

137
00:11:07,564 --> 00:11:08,251
J.

138
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:09,757
J.

139
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:13,558
I beg your pardon?

140
00:11:15,354 --> 00:11:19,505
I asked if you want to
stay over here with Jinn tonight.

141
00:11:20,097 --> 00:11:21,040
Oh.

142
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:23,171
I think so.

143
00:11:24,158 --> 00:11:25,394
No, you don’t think so.

144
00:11:25,868 --> 00:11:27,270
Your parents probably don’t even
remember what you look like anymore.

145
00:11:27,606 --> 00:11:28,424
Go home.

146
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,446
Come on. Don’t start a fight.

147
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,667
Go take a shower.

148
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:32,963
And why didn’t you tell me
you were coming back?

149
00:11:32,963 --> 00:11:33,974
I could’ve made you some food.

150
00:11:34,488 --> 00:11:36,598
Even the plain water
you pour for me tastes good.

151
00:11:36,598 --> 00:11:38,415
Fine. Then plain water it is for dinner, son.

152
00:11:38,415 --> 00:11:39,668
I was joking.

153
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:42,029
Go.

154
00:11:45,878 --> 00:11:46,697
Are you watering the plants or the floor?

155
00:11:46,697 --> 00:11:47,197
It’s soaking wet.

156
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:54,954
Is something wrong, sweetheart?

157
00:11:56,612 --> 00:12:00,125
Auntie Jan, when do you think
you’ll tell Jinn about that?

158
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:11,522
Don’t tell me you came
all the way out just to look for me.

159
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,215
I called you, but you didn’t answer.

160
00:12:13,452 --> 00:12:14,424
Well, well.

161
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:18,435
You told me to go home, but you ended up
searching for me all over the village.

162
00:12:18,435 --> 00:12:21,000
Aw, a newborn kitten.

163
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,293
Meow, meow.

164
00:12:22,293 --> 00:12:23,373
A newborn kitten, my ass!

165
00:12:34,326 --> 00:12:38,235
I’m sorry for intruding on your family matter.

166
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:44,608
I know this weighs heavily on you, and
it’s not something you can easily talk about.

167
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:45,923
But I…

168
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:49,945
I…uh…

169
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:51,121
J.

170
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:57,228
Is this about more than
just your concern for Jinn?

171
00:12:58,217 --> 00:13:00,380
Is there more to the story?

172
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,604
I…

173
00:13:26,977 --> 00:13:28,102
I came to pack my things.

174
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,603
These socks are mine, right?

175
00:13:55,542 --> 00:13:56,829
So, where will you be staying?

176
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:02,928
Home.

177
00:14:06,621 --> 00:14:08,113
Are you sure you can
drive from home to uni every day?

178
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,856
Actually, it’s just an excuse.

179
00:14:13,497 --> 00:14:14,992
My house isn’t that far.

180
00:14:17,848 --> 00:14:18,909
I just…

181
00:14:19,806 --> 00:14:21,422
I don’t want to go back to the place

182
00:14:22,667 --> 00:14:24,492
where Mom and Dad used to live.

183
00:14:27,696 --> 00:14:29,293
Now that they’re not there anymore,

184
00:14:31,197 --> 00:14:32,389
it’s too quiet.

185
00:14:39,603 --> 00:14:43,368
Anyway, I’ll have to adjust someday.

186
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,939
I’ll have to go back
and live in that house eventually.

187
00:14:56,838 --> 00:14:57,459
Van.

188
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:03,969
Why do you have to
act tough when you can’t handle it?

189
00:15:08,968 --> 00:15:10,613
I’m sorry, Farm.

190
00:15:14,402 --> 00:15:16,090
I’m sorry I hurt you.

191
00:15:19,294 --> 00:15:21,063
I never want things to be like this.

192
00:15:26,474 --> 00:15:27,570
Don’t go anywhere.

193
00:15:28,705 --> 00:15:29,953
You can just live with me.

194
00:15:49,999 --> 00:15:51,279
You’re giving all the turtles concussions.

195
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:11,433
What’s wrong?

196
00:16:13,721 --> 00:16:14,748
I’m just tired.

197
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,722
Tired because?

198
00:16:23,786 --> 00:16:26,452
Gosh. How am I supposed to
help if you won’t tell me?

199
00:16:27,276 --> 00:16:28,889
I’ll tell you later.

200
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:32,174
Yeah. Up to you.

201
00:16:36,897 --> 00:16:38,263
Why are you here, though?

202
00:16:39,453 --> 00:16:42,388
Don’t tell me you came
all the way out just to look for me.

203
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:46,351
I was about to go to bed.

204
00:16:46,607 --> 00:16:47,869
I called you, but you didn’t answer.

205
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:49,432
I looked over the veranda
and you weren’t there.

206
00:16:50,201 --> 00:16:51,494
So I figured you might be here.

207
00:16:53,068 --> 00:16:54,408
Well, well.

208
00:16:54,518 --> 00:16:58,445
You told me to go home, but you ended up
searching for me all over the village.

209
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:01,197
Aw, a newborn kitten.

210
00:17:01,197 --> 00:17:02,200
Meow, meow.

211
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,122
A newborn kitten, my ass!

212
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,437
Aw, don’t sulk. I’ll give you a cat snack.

213
00:17:10,684 --> 00:17:12,227
Oh sure.

214
00:17:12,776 --> 00:17:14,013
Then tonight,

215
00:17:14,837 --> 00:17:15,953
we’re sleeping in separate beds.

216
00:17:18,424 --> 00:17:19,809
No!

217
00:17:20,944 --> 00:17:21,611
Hey.

218
00:17:22,325 --> 00:17:23,566
J, people can see.

219
00:17:24,152 --> 00:17:25,914
They can barely see our shadows.

220
00:17:26,591 --> 00:17:31,033
They’ll think we’re ghosts,
not two people being all lovey-dovey.

221
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,171
What the heck are you talking about?

222
00:17:32,171 --> 00:17:33,391
Hey, that hurts.

223
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:34,724
Hey!

224
00:17:36,262 --> 00:17:36,852
J!

225
00:17:37,529 --> 00:17:38,824
Let me kiss you more.

226
00:17:38,889 --> 00:17:40,560
I’m going to fill my lungs with your scent.

227
00:17:40,797 --> 00:17:42,481
Ugh, you’re scary.

228
00:17:42,481 --> 00:17:44,314
J, you’re annoying.

229
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:45,375
Jinn, stay still.

230
00:17:45,705 --> 00:17:46,793
Darling.

231
00:17:46,793 --> 00:17:48,101
Gosh. Go away.

232
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:50,679
Let’s race back home. The slower one loses.

233
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:51,601
Bring it on.

234
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,514
Come here, darling.

235
00:17:53,514 --> 00:17:54,918
Ugh. Get out of here!

236
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:01,434
I can crash on the couch.

237
00:18:02,899 --> 00:18:03,646
No, it’s fine.

238
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:07,660
Are you really not uncomfortable?

239
00:18:08,356 --> 00:18:08,970
Yeah.

240
00:18:13,144 --> 00:18:17,939
If I do anything that annoys you, just tell me.

241
00:18:27,142 --> 00:18:27,925
Get some sleep.

242
00:18:28,968 --> 00:18:29,724
Mm.

243
00:18:52,455 --> 00:18:54,967
Are you feeling okay now?

244
00:18:58,006 --> 00:18:58,723
I am.

245
00:18:59,968 --> 00:19:00,848
I am now.

246
00:19:02,111 --> 00:19:03,124
About your house…

247
00:19:04,131 --> 00:19:07,371
if you’re not ready to go back yet,
you can stay here for now.

248
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:08,568
I’m truly fine with it.

249
00:19:12,577 --> 00:19:16,438
In the end, you’re still the one
who cares about my feelings the most.

250
00:19:19,111 --> 00:19:20,796
Even more than I do.

251
00:19:27,954 --> 00:19:29,563
I care about all my friends.

252
00:19:30,405 --> 00:19:33,668
I’m glad you still look at me that way.

253
00:19:39,526 --> 00:19:40,685
I look at everyone this way.

254
00:19:42,863 --> 00:19:44,139
Don’t get ahead of yourself.

255
00:19:45,164 --> 00:19:46,499
Someone as good as you

256
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,470
deserves someone good too.

257
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,171
But that doesn’t mean that I won’t try.

258
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:56,001
Huh?

259
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,875
I’ll work on myself…

260
00:20:00,461 --> 00:20:02,479
until I’m someone worthy of you.

261
00:20:03,248 --> 00:20:06,214
Then keep trying, roommate.

262
00:20:37,308 --> 00:20:38,164
I win.

263
00:20:40,269 --> 00:20:41,289
Right, Mr. Winner.

264
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:45,454
Should we change things up tonight?

265
00:20:45,454 --> 00:20:46,363
How about we sleep in your room?

266
00:20:49,988 --> 00:20:51,422
Your room’s already a good choice.

267
00:20:51,697 --> 00:20:52,852
Why change?

268
00:20:53,511 --> 00:20:54,287
Why?

269
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:56,897
Are you hiding something in there?

270
00:20:58,252 --> 00:20:59,292
Nothing.

271
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,164
What would I even hide?

272
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:08,558
I just… want to sleep in your room.

273
00:21:08,889 --> 00:21:11,079
Don’t you think
I want to sleep in your room too?

274
00:21:12,031 --> 00:21:13,416
You’ve stayed at my condo.

275
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:14,896
You’ve slept in my room.

276
00:21:14,896 --> 00:21:16,850
You even know me ten years into the future.

277
00:21:18,131 --> 00:21:21,539
But I feel like I haven’t
even started to know you yet.

278
00:21:23,425 --> 00:21:25,649
Come on. Don’t get so serious.

279
00:21:26,766 --> 00:21:31,425
But it feels like the bridge
between us is broken somehow.

280
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,237
Like there’s something missing in between.

281
00:21:37,232 --> 00:21:39,031
I don’t know. It’s hard to explain.

282
00:21:42,108 --> 00:21:42,863
It’s all good.

283
00:21:43,632 --> 00:21:48,756
Where the bridge is broken,
I’ll carry you on my back and cross it.

284
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:50,911
Okay?

285
00:21:51,588 --> 00:21:53,797
You’re playing it off again.

286
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,856
I don’t want you to overthink things.

287
00:21:57,167 --> 00:21:59,944
And my room is a total mess right now.

288
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:02,966
Let me clean it up first,
and then we’ll go there together.

289
00:22:03,076 --> 00:22:03,576
Okay?

290
00:22:07,073 --> 00:22:07,848
Mm.

291
00:22:09,276 --> 00:22:10,612
You said you’d carry me?

292
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:12,709
Come on.

293
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:14,690
To your house.

294
00:22:20,143 --> 00:22:20,935
Thank you.

295
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:39,310
Oh, Mom.

296
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:40,667
We’re staying at the condo tonight.

297
00:22:40,667 --> 00:22:41,987
We have an early class tomorrow.

298
00:22:42,335 --> 00:22:42,894
Mm.

299
00:23:00,929 --> 00:23:01,646
Jeez!

300
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:03,161
Shit! What? What happened?

301
00:23:03,161 --> 00:23:05,085
It’s Van. What the hell is he doing?

302
00:23:05,085 --> 00:23:07,081
Walk away all you want.

303
00:23:07,465 --> 00:23:09,080
My love will still follow you everywhere.

304
00:23:27,526 --> 00:23:28,147
Wait.

305
00:23:28,776 --> 00:23:29,284
Hm?

306
00:23:31,208 --> 00:23:32,788
Can I drive you today?

307
00:23:33,214 --> 00:23:33,732
Why?

308
00:23:34,768 --> 00:23:35,468
Please.

309
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:36,686
Let me drive, please.

310
00:23:38,407 --> 00:23:40,202
Fine. I want to take a nap.

311
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:43,456
Come on, let's go to class.

312
00:23:44,011 --> 00:23:44,528
Let’s go.

313
00:23:49,524 --> 00:23:50,266
Come.

314
00:24:04,546 --> 00:24:05,189
Jeez!

315
00:24:05,189 --> 00:24:06,664
Shit! What? What happened?

316
00:24:06,664 --> 00:24:08,033
- It’s Van.
- What about him?

317
00:24:08,033 --> 00:24:09,103
What the hell is he doing?

318
00:24:09,427 --> 00:24:11,177
Improving myself.

319
00:24:13,434 --> 00:24:14,176
What?

320
00:24:15,231 --> 00:24:15,975
All done.

321
00:24:16,966 --> 00:24:17,777
Done?

322
00:24:19,276 --> 00:24:22,357
Van just unfollowed everyone on Instagram.

323
00:24:22,968 --> 00:24:24,739
What? Him?

324
00:24:26,108 --> 00:24:27,396
Like the promise I made last night.

325
00:24:33,113 --> 00:24:34,348
You don’t have to do that.

326
00:24:35,088 --> 00:24:38,564
If you have to force yourself to be
someone you’re not, then I don’t want it.

327
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:41,291
But if who I am right now is vile…

328
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:44,180
then I should change, right?

329
00:24:46,308 --> 00:24:48,711
I’m doing this for you, yes.

330
00:24:49,026 --> 00:24:50,385
But I’m also doing it for myself.

331
00:24:53,568 --> 00:24:54,956
So this is really what you want?

332
00:24:55,474 --> 00:24:56,044
Mm.

333
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,565
Hold on.

334
00:24:58,305 --> 00:24:59,105
Wait a second.

335
00:24:59,427 --> 00:25:00,377
Are you guys cool now?

336
00:25:04,688 --> 00:25:05,583
Farm.

337
00:25:08,451 --> 00:25:09,326
Hey, Farm.

338
00:25:09,585 --> 00:25:10,580
Where are you going?

339
00:25:10,876 --> 00:25:12,905
Walk away all you want.

340
00:25:14,977 --> 00:25:16,671
My love will still follow you everywhere.

341
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:18,322
Do you hear me, Farm?

342
00:25:18,322 --> 00:25:19,303
“My love will follow,” he says.

343
00:25:20,284 --> 00:25:22,394
Have you been
watching too many K-dramas?

344
00:25:23,027 --> 00:25:23,875
“My love will follow.”

345
00:25:24,227 --> 00:25:26,449
Holy shit. How can you even say that?

346
00:25:26,449 --> 00:25:27,937
Who are you,
and what did you do to my friend?

347
00:25:29,288 --> 00:25:30,691
I’ll go and win him back.

348
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:33,453
What is wrong with him?

349
00:25:33,786 --> 00:25:34,884
Did he take the wrong medication?

350
00:25:37,974 --> 00:25:39,966
Ugh. My whole body’s sore.

351
00:25:40,447 --> 00:25:41,901
What are you guys doing after?

352
00:25:42,253 --> 00:25:43,029
Want to grab something to eat?

353
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:44,696
Yeah, sure. I don’t have anything after.

354
00:25:45,029 --> 00:25:45,751
No.

355
00:25:49,969 --> 00:25:52,098
Okay. Guess that’s a no.

356
00:25:52,394 --> 00:25:53,780
I’ll just go with Farm.

357
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:54,998
Let’s go.

358
00:25:56,663 --> 00:25:57,913
Why are you in such a hurry?
What’s going on?

359
00:25:59,856 --> 00:26:02,611
I asked you what’s going on. Answer me.

360
00:26:13,057 --> 00:26:17,916
I don’t know how you’ll feel about what

361
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:19,427
I’m about to say, but I can’t wait any longer.

362
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:25,275
I… can see the future.

363
00:26:27,273 --> 00:26:27,893
Huh?

364
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:31,921
Jinn’s future. Ten years from now.

365
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:37,562
If we let things unfold the way I’ve seen…

366
00:26:38,173 --> 00:26:43,130
In two years, Jinn will accidentally
find out about you and Uncle Jet.

367
00:26:44,111 --> 00:26:47,649
That night, everyone gets into a fight.

368
00:26:49,851 --> 00:26:51,200
And then an accident happens.

369
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,300
There will be losses.

370
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:01,250
And what should I do?

371
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,811
I don’t know if…

372
00:27:06,643 --> 00:27:10,773
this is the missing key we’re searching for,

373
00:27:11,495 --> 00:27:13,670
but if we can avoid what happens that day,

374
00:27:14,928 --> 00:27:16,723
maybe we can change something.

375
00:27:17,519 --> 00:27:18,271
J…

376
00:27:19,511 --> 00:27:21,366
it’s not that I don’t believe you,

377
00:27:23,734 --> 00:27:26,720
but is this even real?

378
00:27:27,553 --> 00:27:28,538
I understand.

379
00:27:29,352 --> 00:27:31,415
It’s hard to believe.

380
00:27:32,322 --> 00:27:33,681
But I’ve proven it in every way I can.

381
00:27:36,567 --> 00:27:37,818
This is real.

382
00:27:38,558 --> 00:27:39,262
Jinn.

383
00:27:40,372 --> 00:27:41,255
What about Jinn?

384
00:27:41,810 --> 00:27:42,843
Will something happen to him?

385
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:45,037
We have to change it, Auntie Jan.

386
00:27:45,537 --> 00:27:49,351
If we succeed, everyone will be safe.

387
00:27:50,665 --> 00:27:52,872
J, please help me.

388
00:27:53,575 --> 00:27:54,444
Yes, Auntie Jan.

389
00:27:54,999 --> 00:27:56,119
I will help you.

390
00:28:00,541 --> 00:28:01,263
Jinn.

391
00:28:12,511 --> 00:28:14,265
Why did you take me to my mom’s boutique?

392
00:28:45,339 --> 00:28:46,291
Why are you here?!

393
00:28:46,402 --> 00:28:47,048
Jinn.

394
00:28:48,805 --> 00:28:49,404
Jinn,

395
00:28:50,718 --> 00:28:52,614
let’s sit down and talk, son.

396
00:28:52,725 --> 00:28:53,715
Who’s your son?

397
00:28:54,011 --> 00:28:56,161
Jinn, dear.

398
00:28:58,178 --> 00:28:59,807
Don’t talk to your father like that.

399
00:29:00,381 --> 00:29:01,190
Father?

400
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,905
Are you really calling
someone who left us that?

401
00:29:06,848 --> 00:29:08,058
Answer me, Mom.

402
00:29:10,093 --> 00:29:13,920
Jinn, your dad never left us.

403
00:29:14,734 --> 00:29:17,844
It’s my fault for not telling you anything.

404
00:29:17,844 --> 00:29:19,367
What do you mean, never left us?

405
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:21,937
Wasn’t it obvious?

406
00:29:23,473 --> 00:29:26,449
Jinn, your mom and I have been
back together for a while now.

407
00:29:27,152 --> 00:29:27,937
Oh, so now you can do this?

408
00:29:29,427 --> 00:29:30,660
Now that you don’t need fame,

409
00:29:31,659 --> 00:29:32,671
don’t need to deceive your fans,

410
00:29:32,949 --> 00:29:34,308
you suddenly remember we matter?

411
00:29:34,993 --> 00:29:35,666
Jinn!

412
00:29:36,610 --> 00:29:37,545
Why, Mom?

413
00:29:38,785 --> 00:29:40,286
Why can’t it be just the two of us?

414
00:29:40,508 --> 00:29:41,965
Why does he have to be part of this?

415
00:29:42,927 --> 00:29:44,063
It’s not like that, son.

416
00:29:44,427 --> 00:29:46,271
Have you forgotten when he left us?

417
00:29:47,733 --> 00:29:49,192
He left us.

418
00:29:49,192 --> 00:29:50,987
Jinn, will you give me a chance?

419
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:54,223
A chance to make up
for everything I did wrong.

420
00:29:54,223 --> 00:29:55,117
No!

421
00:29:57,189 --> 00:29:58,200
No!

422
00:29:58,792 --> 00:29:59,561
Jinn!

423
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:07,731
Don’t tell me you knew about this too.

424
00:30:10,414 --> 00:30:11,163
Damn it.

425
00:30:12,662 --> 00:30:14,574
Suddenly, I’m all alone in this world.

426
00:30:18,811 --> 00:30:20,758
Jinn, son.

427
00:30:23,607 --> 00:30:25,234
I’ll take care of Jinn, Auntie Jan.

428
00:30:25,826 --> 00:30:28,231
Please take him home, dear.

429
00:30:29,563 --> 00:30:30,401
Please help.

430
00:30:31,067 --> 00:30:31,926
Yes, Auntie Jan.

431
00:30:40,975 --> 00:30:41,883
Where are you going?

432
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:44,115
Where I’m going is none of your business.

433
00:30:44,818 --> 00:30:45,969
You’re not going anywhere.

434
00:30:48,116 --> 00:30:49,645
I have your car keys.

435
00:30:52,624 --> 00:30:53,595
Then give them back.

436
00:30:54,631 --> 00:30:55,652
I will drive.

437
00:30:56,152 --> 00:30:57,764
I’m not letting you drive like this.

438
00:30:57,912 --> 00:30:59,285
I just want some quiet time alone.

439
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:03,935
I promise I’ll stay quiet.

440
00:31:04,638 --> 00:31:05,763
Just let me drive.

441
00:31:06,022 --> 00:31:06,654
Please.

442
00:31:21,322 --> 00:31:22,444
Jinn, I will—

443
00:31:38,117 --> 00:31:39,229
You’re safe now.

444
00:31:46,061 --> 00:31:46,854
Jinn, my dear.

445
00:31:47,983 --> 00:31:48,629
Jinn.

446
00:31:49,665 --> 00:31:50,312
Jinn.

447
00:31:51,311 --> 00:31:52,875
Will you come out and talk to me, please?

448
00:31:53,874 --> 00:31:56,356
Jinn, your mom’s been crying.

449
00:31:56,671 --> 00:31:57,479
Please come out.

450
00:31:58,737 --> 00:31:59,442
Jinn.

451
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:01,842
Jinn.

452
00:32:07,482 --> 00:32:08,176
Jinn.

453
00:32:54,783 --> 00:32:58,785
Is it really a good idea
to let things go on like this?

454
00:33:17,743 --> 00:33:20,900
WHEN YOU’VE CALMED DOWN AND YOU’RE READY TO LISTEN,
LET ME KNOW, SWEETHEART.

455
00:33:28,252 --> 00:33:30,083
YOU’RE NOT ALONE IN THIS WORLD, JINN.

456
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:39,923
If you truly did your best,

457
00:33:40,571 --> 00:33:41,915
then there’s nothing to be afraid of.

458
00:33:48,963 --> 00:33:50,132
What are these pictures?

459
00:33:52,389 --> 00:33:53,022
Jinn…

460
00:33:57,925 --> 00:33:59,913
What if all of this is just a coincidence?

461
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,739
If you’re not really seeing the future,

462
00:34:01,813 --> 00:34:03,253
if we’re not boyfriends in ten years,

463
00:34:03,383 --> 00:34:04,379
what will that be?

464
00:34:04,749 --> 00:34:06,117
You scared me.

465
00:34:06,783 --> 00:34:08,092
Now comfort me, asshole.

466
00:34:18,988 --> 00:34:19,644
Jinn…

467
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,359
I asked what these pictures are!

468
00:34:26,526 --> 00:34:27,637
Will you calm down?

469
00:34:27,922 --> 00:34:30,097
You haven’t been
taking your sleeping pills, have you?

470
00:34:31,642 --> 00:34:32,619
And these pictures…

471
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:34,480
they’re from your dreams, right?

472
00:34:42,508 --> 00:34:43,674
Is this my mom and me?

473
00:34:51,967 --> 00:34:53,569
Are you really ready to listen?

474
00:35:07,461 --> 00:35:08,883
Two years from now…

475
00:35:09,493 --> 00:35:11,775
on the day you accidentally
find out about your dad,

476
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:19,362
you go to the boutique and see Uncle Jet.

477
00:35:19,642 --> 00:35:20,373
Open the door!

478
00:35:21,389 --> 00:35:22,226
Jinn, calm down.

479
00:35:22,226 --> 00:35:24,527
Mom, open the door!

480
00:35:26,397 --> 00:35:27,052
Jinn.

481
00:35:27,052 --> 00:35:28,727
Jinn. Jinn. Jinn.

482
00:35:29,012 --> 00:35:29,622
Get out!

483
00:35:30,049 --> 00:35:30,692
Jinn.

484
00:35:30,692 --> 00:35:31,816
Give me a chance to fix this, son.

485
00:35:31,816 --> 00:35:32,975
You’re not my dad!

486
00:35:32,975 --> 00:35:33,475
Jinn.

487
00:35:34,654 --> 00:35:36,036
And I’m not your son!

488
00:35:36,341 --> 00:35:37,085
Jinn!

489
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:40,382
If you choose him, then you don’t need me.

490
00:35:40,606 --> 00:35:41,487
Jinn!

491
00:35:42,483 --> 00:35:43,422
Wait for me, Jinn.

492
00:35:43,422 --> 00:35:44,262
Son.

493
00:35:47,663 --> 00:35:48,330
Jinn.

494
00:35:56,825 --> 00:35:58,664
There’s a car accident.

495
00:35:58,827 --> 00:36:02,605
Auntie Jan… dies.

496
00:36:10,103 --> 00:36:12,021
Mom always told me not to drive too fast.

497
00:36:14,704 --> 00:36:15,789
But I never listened.

498
00:36:16,155 --> 00:36:17,752
I killed her.

499
00:36:20,435 --> 00:36:22,284
It should’ve been me who died.

500
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:28,376
Keep going.

501
00:36:31,852 --> 00:36:34,955
(Don’t look for me.
I’ll live my life somewhere.)

502
00:36:35,341 --> 00:36:38,140
(One day, I’ll come back. — Jinn)

503
00:36:39,014 --> 00:36:40,091
Seven years.

504
00:36:42,022 --> 00:36:43,062
The time I disappear?

505
00:36:51,984 --> 00:36:53,817
On my 29th birthday,

506
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:56,694
I wish for you to come back.

507
00:36:57,934 --> 00:36:59,248
What the heck are you wishing for?

508
00:36:59,736 --> 00:37:00,811
You’re taking forever.

509
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:06,511
And you come back when we turn 30.

510
00:37:07,243 --> 00:37:08,441
And we get together after that?

511
00:37:10,494 --> 00:37:11,384
I guess so.

512
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:14,637
That’s all I ever dreamed about.

513
00:37:18,621 --> 00:37:19,642
If that’s really all you dreamed about,

514
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,822
then what is this picture?

515
00:37:30,725 --> 00:37:32,013
Is there something you can’t say?

516
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:35,062
All I saw was that you’re sick.

517
00:37:36,586 --> 00:37:38,385
I couldn’t piece everything together,
so I didn’t tell you.

518
00:37:39,868 --> 00:37:41,176
It’s really nothing.

519
00:37:43,642 --> 00:37:44,781
I only have one question.

520
00:37:46,143 --> 00:37:47,258
And you have to tell me the truth.

521
00:37:47,705 --> 00:37:48,368
Jinn…

522
00:37:49,324 --> 00:37:50,641
In the visions you see ten years from now,

523
00:37:52,409 --> 00:37:53,505
when exactly do we get together?

524
00:37:54,033 --> 00:37:55,773
Why do you want to know about that?

525
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:56,851
Is it before my mom dies,

526
00:37:58,436 --> 00:37:59,488
or right before I’m about to die?

527
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:08,526
Answer me!

528
00:38:13,973 --> 00:38:15,482
What does it matter when we get together?

529
00:38:15,482 --> 00:38:16,554
It does!

530
00:38:17,652 --> 00:38:21,850
Because I need to know whether
we’re together because you love me,

531
00:38:22,988 --> 00:38:24,190
or because you feel sorry for me.

532
00:38:28,844 --> 00:38:30,044
I’m right, aren’t I?

533
00:38:34,678 --> 00:38:36,234
What makes you think that?

534
00:38:36,234 --> 00:38:38,783
If none of this ever happened,
if you never dreamed about any of it…

535
00:38:39,169 --> 00:38:42,618
Think carefully. Would we even fall in love?

536
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:48,604
It can’t be like this.

537
00:38:48,848 --> 00:38:50,048
Then have you ever wondered

538
00:38:50,048 --> 00:38:52,792
why there are no memories
before we get together?

539
00:38:54,804 --> 00:38:56,302
Because there aren’t any, J.

540
00:38:59,737 --> 00:39:00,284
Jinn…

541
00:39:00,284 --> 00:39:04,274
I’m grateful for everything
you’ve done for me and my family.

542
00:39:06,571 --> 00:39:09,742
And I’m glad that, at the very least,

543
00:39:10,697 --> 00:39:12,304
we don’t hate each other until the end.

544
00:39:15,963 --> 00:39:17,480
But if this mess finally gets fixed,

545
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:21,750
I don’t want you to
throw your entire life away for me.

546
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:26,987
We should take a break
and think this through.

547
00:40:05,226 --> 00:40:07,454
How are you this cute?

548
00:40:13,084 --> 00:40:13,788
Idiot.

549
00:40:14,987 --> 00:40:18,093
Stop saying stuff like that. I’m going to puke.

550
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:20,270
Just admit you’re blushing.

551
00:40:28,649 --> 00:40:30,148
I just want to hug you tight.

552
00:40:31,246 --> 00:40:31,953
Is it too tight?

553
00:40:32,807 --> 00:40:33,484
Yeah.

554
00:40:34,317 --> 00:40:36,853
It feels like getting wrapped by a snake.

555
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,301
Well, I love you.

556
00:40:48,674 --> 00:40:50,036
Have you ever thought…

557
00:40:50,869 --> 00:40:53,354
what if all of this is just a coincidence?

558
00:40:54,249 --> 00:40:55,785
If you’re not really seeing the future,

559
00:40:56,435 --> 00:40:58,202
if we’re not boyfriends in ten years…

560
00:41:00,824 --> 00:41:01,798
what will that be?

561
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:04,536
Then I guess it’s only my feelings…

562
00:41:08,154 --> 00:41:09,272
that became real.

563
00:41:24,032 --> 00:41:24,718
I’m sorry.

564
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:36,988
I’m done thinking it through.

565
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:38,561
Are you?

566
00:41:39,842 --> 00:41:41,723
I was done the moment
you walked out my door.

567
00:42:06,701 --> 00:42:08,049
Damn it. I’m sorry.

568
00:42:10,915 --> 00:42:14,055
I said those things to sound cool.

569
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,473
But I forgot that

570
00:42:17,022 --> 00:42:19,018
even if your feelings aren’t real,

571
00:42:19,642 --> 00:42:23,244
mine have been real ever since I was seven.

572
00:42:23,915 --> 00:42:25,268
But I do love you.

573
00:42:27,992 --> 00:42:30,895
I don’t know why
we fall in love in that parallel world,

574
00:42:31,342 --> 00:42:33,058
but all this time we’ve been together…

575
00:42:33,403 --> 00:42:34,755
I truly love you.

576
00:42:44,943 --> 00:42:46,172
Screw that parallel world.

577
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:47,359
Okay?

578
00:43:06,593 --> 00:43:08,062
You scared me.

579
00:43:08,631 --> 00:43:09,878
Now comfort me, asshole.

580
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:15,798
The blame is on me this time.

581
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,274
Tell me what you want.

582
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:23,615
Are you sure you can do anything?

583
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:30,418
There are only a few things
someone like you would want.

584
00:43:32,085 --> 00:43:35,084
Then why don’t you take a guess?

585
00:43:48,381 --> 00:43:49,411
Am I guessing right?

586
00:43:51,118 --> 00:43:53,540
Almost.

587
00:43:56,142 --> 00:44:00,063
I’m sorry for belittling
the love you have for me.

588
00:44:01,913 --> 00:44:02,834
It’s fine.

589
00:44:04,094 --> 00:44:07,023
As long as you repent quickly, we’re good.

590
00:44:08,913 --> 00:44:10,345
Are you sassing me?

591
00:44:19,778 --> 00:44:20,677
You know?

592
00:44:22,303 --> 00:44:24,049
Ever since we got together,

593
00:44:25,939 --> 00:44:28,194
I promised myself that

594
00:44:30,837 --> 00:44:34,686
if I ever see a vision where we break up,

595
00:44:36,515 --> 00:44:38,347
I will get rid of it all.

596
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:40,942
J…

597
00:44:42,853 --> 00:44:43,879
Believe me.

598
00:44:46,562 --> 00:44:48,138
I’m so damn in love with you.

599
00:45:54,894 --> 00:45:59,161
(If you’re reading this letter,
it means I’m no longer in this world.)

600
00:45:59,161 --> 00:46:00,648
Give me a chance to fix this.

601
00:46:00,953 --> 00:46:04,337
A chance to love each other longer,
so things don’t end like this.

602
00:46:04,683 --> 00:46:05,807
You know that, right?

603
00:46:05,807 --> 00:46:07,332
That I like you for who you really are.

604
00:46:07,454 --> 00:46:09,003
Are you confessing that you like me?

605
00:46:09,186 --> 00:46:10,739
I haven’t even worked that hard
to win you back yet.

606
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:11,578
You’re already soft on me?

607
00:46:12,066 --> 00:46:13,335
Right now, I love you.

608
00:46:13,642 --> 00:46:14,501
You keep saying that.

609
00:46:14,603 --> 00:46:17,642
Well, if there were a word
that meant more than that, I’d use it.
