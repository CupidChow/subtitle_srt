4
00:00:13,235 --> 00:00:18,193
Ever since my parents passed, you’re the
only one who’s cared about me this much.

5
00:00:18,193 --> 00:00:19,241
Would you be my boyfriend?

6
00:00:24,545 --> 00:00:25,837
It was an accident.

7
00:00:25,837 --> 00:00:27,461
But I was able to help you last time.

8
00:00:27,766 --> 00:00:29,557
I hate that you’re blaming yourself.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,397
Make me a promise.

10
00:00:31,397 --> 00:00:34,420
From here on out, we live a normal life.

11
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:39,522
If something happens to me one day,
I’ll believe you did your best.

12
00:00:39,522 --> 00:00:41,455
So you’re telling me
you can change the future?

13
00:00:41,782 --> 00:00:43,121
I’m not changing anything.

14
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:44,074
I…

15
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:45,335
I just helped him.

16
00:00:45,727 --> 00:00:46,736
About Uncle Jet…

17
00:00:48,435 --> 00:00:50,103
When are you planning to tell Jinn?

18
00:00:51,432 --> 00:00:55,307
I’ll find a time to
talk to Jinn as soon as possible.

19
00:00:55,307 --> 00:00:57,529
From what I’ve seen in the movies…

20
00:00:58,618 --> 00:01:00,841
when you decide to change something,

21
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:06,051
it affects the future. Right?

22
00:01:16,723 --> 00:01:18,594
Mom always told me not to drive too fast.

23
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,230
But I never listened.

24
00:01:21,883 --> 00:01:23,492
I killed her.

25
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,314
It should’ve been me who died.

26
00:01:27,077 --> 00:01:30,945
Jinn, no one wanted this to happen.

27
00:01:30,945 --> 00:01:32,124
It was an accident.

28
00:01:32,777 --> 00:01:35,264
It isn’t anyone’s fault, sweetheart.

29
00:01:36,201 --> 00:01:37,459
I feel bad for him.

30
00:01:38,722 --> 00:01:40,749
Graduation is just a few days away.

31
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:43,419
Auntie Jan should’ve been here with him.

32
00:01:43,942 --> 00:01:45,396
All I can do is take care of him.

33
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,890
He’s my friend after all.

34
00:03:30,778 --> 00:03:33,417
Jinn, my mom says it’s time to eat.

35
00:03:37,686 --> 00:03:39,762
Jinn, do you hear me?

36
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:47,884
Jinn!

37
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:58,528
Jinn.

38
00:04:01,926 --> 00:04:02,627
Jinn.

39
00:04:03,978 --> 00:04:05,529
If you don’t answer, I’m coming in.

40
00:04:16,115 --> 00:04:18,010
Jinn, where did you go?

41
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:27,410
(Don’t look for me.
I’ll live my life somewhere.)

42
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:30,475
(One day, I’ll come back. — Jinn)

43
00:04:36,248 --> 00:04:36,859
J.

44
00:04:37,382 --> 00:04:37,988
J.

45
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,293
Jinn, don’t go.

46
00:04:53,134 --> 00:04:53,665
J.

47
00:04:56,889 --> 00:04:57,869
Did you have a bad dream, son?

48
00:04:58,152 --> 00:04:58,710
Huh?

49
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,100
Yes, Mom.

50
00:05:16,124 --> 00:05:17,640
But I don’t remember it now.

51
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:21,798
Does anything hurt, sweetheart?

52
00:05:23,802 --> 00:05:24,664
Not anymore.

53
00:05:25,405 --> 00:05:27,560
I’ll be able to run tomorrow.

54
00:05:29,847 --> 00:05:32,706
I requested the surveillance footage
from the scene,

55
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,483
so we’ll know what really happened.

56
00:05:36,226 --> 00:05:37,540
Thank you so much, Auntie Jan.

57
00:05:39,609 --> 00:05:41,393
Dad went to file a report at the police station.

58
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:43,006
He’ll be back later.

59
00:05:43,224 --> 00:05:44,820
Let me stay with you tonight.

60
00:05:46,868 --> 00:05:48,061
It’s okay, Mom.

61
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:49,831
I’m all good here.

62
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,626
If you sleep on that hard sofa,

63
00:05:52,844 --> 00:05:55,152
you’ll be the next patient
waiting for slipped-disc treatment.

64
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:57,785
I’m not that old.

65
00:05:58,417 --> 00:06:01,028
Don’t hit him so hard. He’s injured.

66
00:06:04,121 --> 00:06:05,305
I’m reall fine.

67
00:06:05,741 --> 00:06:07,753
You can go home and let Dad comfort you.

68
00:06:09,343 --> 00:06:11,645
Hey, don’t tease your mom.

69
00:06:11,797 --> 00:06:16,015
When you were little, she’d keep applying
medicine again and again for just an ant bite.

70
00:06:16,015 --> 00:06:17,961
But this time you got hit by a car.

71
00:06:18,288 --> 00:06:19,426
How could she not cry?

72
00:06:22,214 --> 00:06:27,926
If it were me,
I’d definitely react the same way.

73
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:50,175
Please.

74
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:57,310
Mom, Auntie Jen, you can go home.

75
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,005
Our friends are coming to visit J,

76
00:06:59,135 --> 00:07:00,824
so I’ll stay a bit longer.

77
00:07:01,477 --> 00:07:03,089
Then take good care of him for me, dear.

78
00:07:03,481 --> 00:07:04,411
Sure, Auntie Jen.

79
00:07:04,651 --> 00:07:06,109
Don’t worry.

80
00:07:06,305 --> 00:07:08,323
The doctor said J isn’t seriously injured,

81
00:07:08,323 --> 00:07:09,212
so please don’t stress.

82
00:07:09,212 --> 00:07:14,629
And tomorrow, once he’s discharged,
I’ll drive extra safe and slow to take J home.

83
00:07:15,653 --> 00:07:18,130
I don’t think Auntie Jen
is stressed about anything…

84
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:22,602
except the part
where you said “extra safe and slow.”

85
00:07:23,869 --> 00:07:25,823
Come on, Mom. I’m trying to be cool here.

86
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:29,593
I do want both of you to drive carefully.

87
00:07:29,593 --> 00:07:32,762
J is in there because of a reckless driver.

88
00:07:32,762 --> 00:07:35,582
So, let’s not be the cause of
anyone else’s injury, okay?

89
00:07:36,366 --> 00:07:37,249
Of course, Auntie Jen.

90
00:07:37,249 --> 00:07:41,660
I promise I’ll drive so slowly
even a turtle could pass me.

91
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,644
- Okay.
- Is that sarcasm?

92
00:07:44,624 --> 00:07:45,326
Come on.

93
00:07:45,326 --> 00:07:46,245
Let me walk you out.

94
00:07:46,245 --> 00:07:47,781
Let’s go, you two gorgeous ladies.

95
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:49,447
This way, please.

96
00:07:49,774 --> 00:07:51,129
The elevator is on your left.

97
00:07:51,129 --> 00:07:52,663
Go straight first and then turn left.

98
00:07:57,194 --> 00:07:59,089
Good, you’re here.
Can you get me some water?

99
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:32,144
I really can’t remember the dream.

100
00:08:33,255 --> 00:08:34,436
I’m not doubting that.

101
00:08:36,091 --> 00:08:37,214
What do you mean?

102
00:08:38,782 --> 00:08:40,231
You skipped class today.

103
00:08:41,342 --> 00:08:43,158
What were you doing at my mom’s boutique?

104
00:08:46,469 --> 00:08:47,549
About Uncle Jet…

105
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:50,020
When are you planning to tell Jinn?

106
00:08:51,392 --> 00:08:52,723
How did you find out, dear?

107
00:08:52,723 --> 00:08:53,960
When did you learn about this?

108
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:55,528
Well?

109
00:08:56,247 --> 00:08:57,929
Why did you go to my mom’s boutique?

110
00:09:00,804 --> 00:09:01,541
I…

111
00:09:03,523 --> 00:09:05,025
I just…

112
00:09:16,823 --> 00:09:18,002
How’re you holding up?

113
00:09:18,677 --> 00:09:20,528
I thought I’d be one friend short today.

114
00:09:20,702 --> 00:09:22,402
In your f*cking dreams, dude.

115
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,738
That’s totally an old-people get-well gift.

116
00:09:29,913 --> 00:09:31,890
See? I told you.

117
00:09:32,151 --> 00:09:35,358
We should’ve saved this basket for
our professor when he grades our work.

118
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,522
What do you want to eat then?

119
00:09:39,066 --> 00:09:40,686
Or drink instead?

120
00:09:42,145 --> 00:09:44,432
You guys can’t get any worse.

121
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:46,898
We’re kidding.

122
00:09:46,898 --> 00:09:48,394
Food has been ordered for us all.

123
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,836
Is it even edible?

124
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:50,678
Hey, dude.

125
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:53,034
It is. I ordered it.

126
00:09:53,252 --> 00:09:54,292
Fine then.

127
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,840
Food’s here.

128
00:10:00,842 --> 00:10:01,627
Jinn.

129
00:10:02,237 --> 00:10:03,471
Can you come get it with me?

130
00:10:03,471 --> 00:10:04,628
Yeah, sure.

131
00:10:05,085 --> 00:10:08,702
Hey, you two can’t leave me alone with Van.

132
00:10:09,116 --> 00:10:11,064
My wounds will just get more infected.

133
00:10:11,064 --> 00:10:13,006
Come on, they won’t burst open.

134
00:10:13,006 --> 00:10:14,184
You don’t even have surgical wounds.

135
00:10:15,513 --> 00:10:16,209
Why?

136
00:10:16,754 --> 00:10:19,931
What’s wrong with being alone with me?

137
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:20,624
Nothing.

138
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,529
Be nice to him.

139
00:10:27,236 --> 00:10:28,536
What are you doing, Van?

140
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,079
Don’t.

141
00:10:31,471 --> 00:10:32,434
Let me see your wound.

142
00:10:32,434 --> 00:10:33,765
No. Van, don’t!

143
00:10:34,527 --> 00:10:36,551
- Let me see.
- No.

144
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:40,630
Come on.

145
00:10:42,351 --> 00:10:42,985
Jinn.

146
00:10:44,575 --> 00:10:45,792
What did the doctor say?

147
00:10:47,883 --> 00:10:48,651
He’ll be fine.

148
00:10:48,978 --> 00:10:51,347
His head did hit the floor, though.

149
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:54,226
But he had an X-ray. Nothing seems wrong.

150
00:10:55,664 --> 00:10:59,359
Your fates are really intertwined.

151
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,575
Just a coincidence, I guess.

152
00:11:02,969 --> 00:11:03,635
Hey.

153
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:06,011
J told me everything.

154
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:08,232
This is unbelievable.

155
00:11:12,327 --> 00:11:15,266
J told you about his superpower?

156
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,434
You guys call it that?

157
00:11:20,571 --> 00:11:22,728
Yeah. He was the one who named it.

158
00:11:22,946 --> 00:11:25,921
Didn’t he see it before he got hit by that car?

159
00:11:26,531 --> 00:11:27,682
Like when he helped you?

160
00:11:30,339 --> 00:11:31,178
I don’t know.

161
00:11:31,897 --> 00:11:34,311
Honestly, I haven’t had
the chance to talk to him yet.

162
00:11:35,313 --> 00:11:37,961
It’s his superpower,
and he can’t even use it to help himself.

163
00:11:41,751 --> 00:11:43,127
- Farm.
- Hm?

164
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,250
Do you think J ended up like this

165
00:11:48,404 --> 00:11:50,056
because he helped me?

166
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:51,588
You’re overthinking it, Jinn.

167
00:11:53,243 --> 00:11:55,086
Look at where we are right now.

168
00:11:55,674 --> 00:11:56,844
Should we underthink it?

169
00:11:57,497 --> 00:12:00,045
It might be just a coincidence or an accident.

170
00:12:00,481 --> 00:12:01,852
No, I’m…

171
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:05,680
I’m afraid he’s trading his life for mine.

172
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:08,504
You’re reading too much into it, Jinn.

173
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,581
This is real life.

174
00:12:11,082 --> 00:12:12,705
Stuff like that doesn’t happen.

175
00:12:14,927 --> 00:12:18,464
But in real life right now, J can see the future.

176
00:12:20,947 --> 00:12:21,881
I don’t know, man.

177
00:12:26,738 --> 00:12:28,411
I’m glad they finally left.

178
00:12:28,585 --> 00:12:30,090
They always exhaust me.

179
00:12:34,076 --> 00:12:35,522
Get some rest.

180
00:12:36,568 --> 00:12:39,284
If everything goes well, you can be
discharged late tomorrow morning.

181
00:12:43,815 --> 00:12:46,450
Are you still worried?

182
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:48,762
No.

183
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:55,009
I went to Auntie Jan’s shop
to pick up some things.

184
00:12:55,554 --> 00:12:57,127
When I left, a car hit me.

185
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:59,092
Then I woke up here.

186
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,532
What now?

187
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:14,990
Actually, no.

188
00:13:16,058 --> 00:13:16,928
It just grazed me.

189
00:13:19,585 --> 00:13:23,057
Hit or grazed, you almost died.

190
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:27,445
If I died, I wouldn’t be hugging you right now.

191
00:13:27,924 --> 00:13:28,602
Hm?

192
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:32,644
How did the accident happen anyway?

193
00:13:38,834 --> 00:13:39,530
J.

194
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,336
J.

195
00:13:44,427 --> 00:13:45,146
J.

196
00:13:46,497 --> 00:13:47,179
What’s wrong?

197
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:50,739
Nothing.

198
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:53,085
I just want to hug you tight.

199
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,817
Is it too tight?

200
00:13:56,516 --> 00:13:57,255
Yes.

201
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,597
It feels like getting wrapped by a snake.

202
00:14:02,753 --> 00:14:03,718
Well, because I love you.

203
00:14:12,731 --> 00:14:13,526
What are you doing?

204
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,608
It’s not every day
we get to wear matching outfits.

205
00:14:16,935 --> 00:14:17,614
What?

206
00:14:17,897 --> 00:14:19,043
Matching outfits?

207
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:20,813
How?

208
00:14:21,423 --> 00:14:22,344
Our bandages.

209
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:28,489
Done.

210
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:30,720
This is so heart-fluttering.

211
00:14:33,572 --> 00:14:34,507
Right?

212
00:14:34,899 --> 00:14:35,980
I was being sarcastic, dipshit.

213
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:39,948
Let me see the photo.

214
00:14:49,611 --> 00:14:52,092
You took my notebook
and forbade me from looking.

215
00:14:52,092 --> 00:14:53,054
You didn’t look, did you?

216
00:14:53,054 --> 00:14:55,043
Why? Is there a secret?

217
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:58,530
That means in two years,

218
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:02,008
Auntie Jan will die
and you will disappear, Jinn?

219
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:21,678
What are you doing?

220
00:15:22,591 --> 00:15:23,252
What?

221
00:15:23,252 --> 00:15:25,107
Hey, I’m sorry.

222
00:15:29,447 --> 00:15:30,987
Are you stressed? Why are you smoking?

223
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:32,881
No reason.

224
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,072
Just felt like it.

225
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:37,708
I didn’t know you were a heavy smoker.

226
00:15:38,547 --> 00:15:39,959
Not that heavy.

227
00:15:40,704 --> 00:15:42,356
I just came out here
to have a phone call with my dad.

228
00:15:42,617 --> 00:15:44,961
I saw a pack lying around, so…

229
00:15:46,508 --> 00:15:47,149
What did you talk about?

230
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:51,040
Why do you want to know?

231
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:54,054
You never tell your friends about your family.

232
00:15:54,296 --> 00:15:56,002
All we know is you’re loaded.

233
00:15:56,151 --> 00:15:57,547
And that’s it.

234
00:15:57,659 --> 00:15:58,760
That is it.

235
00:15:59,338 --> 00:16:00,885
I don’t know what else to say.

236
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:03,138
I’ve never seen you go home.

237
00:16:05,523 --> 00:16:06,708
I’m not welcome there.

238
00:16:08,124 --> 00:16:11,986
Your life totally fits
the spoiled rich boy stereotype.

239
00:16:12,415 --> 00:16:13,126
How?

240
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:16,309
Rich, but you don’t get along with your family.

241
00:16:16,812 --> 00:16:19,752
You’re mysterious; you never post anything.

242
00:16:20,032 --> 00:16:22,038
You’re like a rare white elephant.

243
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:25,224
I’ll post something now then.

244
00:16:30,643 --> 00:16:31,615
What are you doing?

245
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:33,783
Posting it on my Stories. Why?

246
00:16:36,317 --> 00:16:36,992
Nothing.

247
00:16:37,421 --> 00:16:39,111
I just…

248
00:16:40,658 --> 00:16:41,376
I…

249
00:16:41,823 --> 00:16:42,553
I don’t want—

250
00:16:42,553 --> 00:16:43,756
What happened to your arm?

251
00:16:57,632 --> 00:16:59,799
But you told your mom
you could sleep alone.

252
00:16:59,948 --> 00:17:01,338
I changed my mind.

253
00:17:01,450 --> 00:17:03,919
I don’t have clothes. I didn’t bring anything.

254
00:17:04,105 --> 00:17:06,773
Come on. Don’t be cruel.

255
00:17:08,525 --> 00:17:11,252
Then I’ll go home for a shower and clothes.

256
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,614
I’ll be back in an hour.

257
00:17:14,123 --> 00:17:14,821
Okay?

258
00:17:18,418 --> 00:17:19,680
You’re the best.

259
00:17:20,463 --> 00:17:21,873
So you’ll stop all the nuisance.

260
00:17:23,867 --> 00:17:24,734
I’m going.

261
00:17:24,734 --> 00:17:26,348
Mm. Come back quick.

262
00:17:28,137 --> 00:17:28,920
Jinn, wait.

263
00:17:34,082 --> 00:17:35,330
Can you grab one thing for me?

264
00:17:41,755 --> 00:17:44,440
I didn’t know you were
allergic to cigarette smoke.

265
00:17:45,819 --> 00:17:48,232
Well, you never asked.

266
00:17:51,773 --> 00:17:54,412
It’s just a rash. It’ll go away soon.

267
00:17:54,878 --> 00:17:56,569
So what do you do when you go to bars?

268
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,426
I take pills beforehand.

269
00:17:58,426 --> 00:17:58,982
What?

270
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:00,917
Pills before drinking?

271
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:01,697
What?

272
00:18:02,368 --> 00:18:03,082
I’m not supposed to?

273
00:18:03,231 --> 00:18:05,369
It’s common knowledge.

274
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:07,891
Come on. Go easy on me.

275
00:18:07,891 --> 00:18:09,075
Don’t be so harsh.

276
00:18:09,224 --> 00:18:10,618
You know I’m dumb.

277
00:18:12,687 --> 00:18:13,970
Rub it for me.

278
00:18:17,902 --> 00:18:19,191
Yeah, I applied it for you,

279
00:18:19,191 --> 00:18:20,463
and now I have to rub it too.

280
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:22,734
Where else does it itch?

281
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,952
A little on my back.

282
00:18:34,162 --> 00:18:35,592
Is there anything else I should know?

283
00:18:36,897 --> 00:18:37,542
What?

284
00:18:38,232 --> 00:18:41,308
Is there anything else
about you that I don’t know?

285
00:18:45,081 --> 00:18:47,691
You don’t have to be so serious.

286
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:50,324
I have an allergy. I take pills. That’s it.

287
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:55,328
But you are my boyfriend now.

288
00:18:56,577 --> 00:19:00,251
If dating me doesn’t make your life better,
then why bother?

289
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,410
Hey, that sounds a bit much.

290
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:10,263
Fine. Okay.

291
00:19:11,027 --> 00:19:12,384
From now on, whatever it is, I’ll tell you.

292
00:19:12,962 --> 00:19:14,132
I just can’t think of anything right now.

293
00:19:15,399 --> 00:19:18,947
Once I do, I’ll make you a list. Okay?

294
00:19:21,351 --> 00:19:23,147
I want this to be good.

295
00:19:24,004 --> 00:19:28,775
Because I know how scary bad love can be.

296
00:19:33,285 --> 00:19:34,554
Okay, sir.

297
00:20:01,864 --> 00:20:02,640
Did you peek?

298
00:20:04,429 --> 00:20:05,670
You took my notebook

299
00:20:06,136 --> 00:20:07,376
and forbade me from looking.

300
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:09,009
Are you crazy?

301
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:10,494
You didn’t look, did you?

302
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,855
No, I didn’t.

303
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:15,194
Why? Is there a secret?

304
00:20:20,188 --> 00:20:20,882
No.

305
00:20:22,149 --> 00:20:23,717
I just wrote my love confession.

306
00:20:24,481 --> 00:20:28,695
So when you open it, you’ll blush.

307
00:20:29,124 --> 00:20:29,762
Idiot.

308
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:45,546
I’m going to sleep. Goodnight.

309
00:20:46,757 --> 00:20:47,827
Yeah. Goodnight.

310
00:21:32,931 --> 00:21:34,434
Calm down, J.

311
00:22:15,107 --> 00:22:18,047
(Don’t look for me.
I’ll live my life somewhere.)

312
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:20,379
(One day, I’ll come back. — Jinn)

313
00:22:21,889 --> 00:22:23,686
Graduation is just a few days away.

314
00:22:24,189 --> 00:22:25,584
Auntie Jan should’ve been here with him.

315
00:22:29,051 --> 00:22:30,646
That means in two years,

316
00:22:32,211 --> 00:22:33,285
Auntie Jan will die

317
00:22:35,652 --> 00:22:38,296
and you will disappear, Jinn?

318
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:44,445
I will change everything.

319
00:22:45,805 --> 00:22:46,628
I promise.

320
00:22:52,736 --> 00:22:54,286
I thought you were at Auntie Jen’s house.

321
00:22:54,846 --> 00:22:56,036
Why would I be?

322
00:22:56,390 --> 00:22:58,400
You and J have been sticking together lately,

323
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,198
so I thought you might want to look after him.

324
00:23:00,794 --> 00:23:01,784
That shithead’s got hands and feet.

325
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,082
Let him take care of himself.

326
00:23:03,809 --> 00:23:04,666
Hey, language.

327
00:23:04,734 --> 00:23:06,799
I’m sorry, ma’am.

328
00:23:09,734 --> 00:23:11,806
(Let’s move on to our latest news.)

329
00:23:11,806 --> 00:23:18,277
(Jet Kueanarakool appeared
at a CSR event for J Group,)

330
00:23:18,277 --> 00:23:21,356
(the family business he took over)

331
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:23,452
(after resigning from
the entertainment industry years ago.)

332
00:23:23,452 --> 00:23:25,234
(This activity …)

333
00:23:25,234 --> 00:23:27,447
Wow, your dad still looks hot.
(...benefit children across the country.)

334
00:23:29,907 --> 00:23:30,407
What?

335
00:23:30,631 --> 00:23:31,131
Mom.

336
00:23:32,137 --> 00:23:32,845
What?

337
00:23:33,646 --> 00:23:35,719
Don’t you think it’s a shame?

338
00:23:36,297 --> 00:23:38,271
You almost had a famous last name.

339
00:23:39,408 --> 00:23:40,305
No.

340
00:23:40,678 --> 00:23:41,777
Why would I?

341
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:47,297
It’s been ten years.

342
00:23:47,297 --> 00:23:49,336
You shouldn’t still hold a grudge
against your dad.

343
00:23:50,026 --> 00:23:52,584
I told you I only have you as a parent.

344
00:23:52,733 --> 00:23:54,384
A mom alone can’t make a child.

345
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,008
Can you stop trying to push me
toward someone who never wanted me?

346
00:23:59,847 --> 00:24:01,542
Why would you say that, dear?

347
00:24:02,548 --> 00:24:04,048
I might’ve been young,

348
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,124
but I remember every word.

349
00:24:07,727 --> 00:24:09,178
Let me know if you need anything, Jan.

350
00:24:09,998 --> 00:24:10,498
Sure.

351
00:24:11,411 --> 00:24:12,252
Go on.

352
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,230
We will be fine.

353
00:24:18,516 --> 00:24:19,702
Where are you going, Dad?

354
00:24:28,237 --> 00:24:29,901
Do you want this uncle to be your dad?

355
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,421
I’m not your father.

356
00:24:33,943 --> 00:24:35,209
I can’t be.

357
00:24:44,657 --> 00:24:45,617
Dad!

358
00:24:46,102 --> 00:24:46,679
Dad!

359
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:47,332
Jinn.

360
00:24:47,332 --> 00:24:48,602
I’m going to talk to Dad!

361
00:24:48,602 --> 00:24:50,065
- Jinn, don’t go.
- Let go!

362
00:24:50,065 --> 00:24:51,015
Jinn.

363
00:24:51,201 --> 00:24:52,024
Let go!

364
00:24:52,397 --> 00:24:53,143
Jinn.

365
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:54,812
I wanna go see Dad.

366
00:24:54,961 --> 00:24:56,076
Don’t, son.

367
00:24:57,971 --> 00:24:59,791
He said himself he wasn’t my dad.

368
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,694
Jinn,

369
00:25:03,644 --> 00:25:05,559
here’s the story. Your dad was—

370
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:07,351
Can we not talk about this, Mom?

371
00:25:09,587 --> 00:25:10,836
Please.

372
00:25:12,029 --> 00:25:13,562
It’s enough for me to have just you.

373
00:25:18,277 --> 00:25:19,988
Mm.

374
00:25:21,486 --> 00:25:24,066
We’ve managed just fine, the two of us.

375
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:26,236
Exactly.

376
00:25:26,814 --> 00:25:28,451
You raised me so well.

377
00:25:28,991 --> 00:25:31,085
You’re a super wonderful woman.

378
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,734
With flattery like that,
do you want something?

379
00:25:37,647 --> 00:25:38,914
It’s a real compliment.

380
00:25:38,914 --> 00:25:40,007
You really are great.

381
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,161
You raised me without him,
and you did it well.

382
00:25:45,155 --> 00:25:49,037
So, can you please not talk about him?

383
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,969
I don’t like it when Mom talks about him.

384
00:25:59,969 --> 00:26:01,085
What if he regrets it?

385
00:26:01,085 --> 00:26:02,562
Would you forgive him?

386
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:04,840
You should at least let him explain.

387
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:06,277
Are you taking his side?

388
00:26:06,426 --> 00:26:07,700
It’s not that.

389
00:26:08,185 --> 00:26:10,489
I just want you to
look at it from another angle.

390
00:26:55,484 --> 00:26:58,592
Every time you can’t sleep,
you become my burden.

391
00:26:59,080 --> 00:26:59,838
Says who?

392
00:27:04,742 --> 00:27:07,593
Are you sure I’m the one who can’t sleep?

393
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:15,403
What?

394
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:17,378
What did my mom tell you?

395
00:27:19,592 --> 00:27:20,161
Hm?

396
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:34,699
I don’t like it when she talks about him.

397
00:27:38,988 --> 00:27:39,923
Self-willed kiddo.

398
00:27:45,136 --> 00:27:46,727
Your family is warm.

399
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,431
You don’t get it.

400
00:27:54,384 --> 00:27:56,460
Auntie Jan raised you well, though.

401
00:27:57,524 --> 00:28:01,176
She did. That’s why I don’t need a father.

402
00:28:03,164 --> 00:28:04,506
What if he regrets it?

403
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:07,756
Would you forgive him?

404
00:28:10,476 --> 00:28:12,766
You should at least let him explain.

405
00:28:15,346 --> 00:28:19,128
You sound like you know something.

406
00:28:19,581 --> 00:28:20,083
Hm?

407
00:28:27,197 --> 00:28:27,916
No.

408
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:30,726
I’m just saying.

409
00:28:33,062 --> 00:28:34,510
It’s been a long time.

410
00:28:34,998 --> 00:28:36,566
He was an actor back then.

411
00:28:36,636 --> 00:28:42,247
And at the time, having a partner
and a kid was a big deal.

412
00:28:50,004 --> 00:28:50,971
So…

413
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,700
you’re taking his side?

414
00:28:53,206 --> 00:28:54,307
It’s not that.

415
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,100
I just want you to
look at it from another angle.

416
00:29:00,465 --> 00:29:01,731
Did you dream about him?

417
00:29:02,864 --> 00:29:03,902
What happened in it?

418
00:29:04,704 --> 00:29:07,875
Did I forgive him… or chase him away?

419
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:10,669
You’re not my dad!

420
00:29:10,669 --> 00:29:11,288
Jinn.

421
00:29:11,288 --> 00:29:12,375
And I’m not your son!

422
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,062
- J.
- (Jinn.)

423
00:29:14,945 --> 00:29:16,021
I didn’t dream about anything.

424
00:29:16,265 --> 00:29:17,147
Just sleep.

425
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,611
Just sleep, okay?

426
00:29:26,153 --> 00:29:26,819
Hey.

427
00:29:27,586 --> 00:29:30,157
You don’t tell me about your dreams lately.

428
00:29:31,046 --> 00:29:31,711
Why?

429
00:29:32,653 --> 00:29:33,652
Have you been seeing something bad?

430
00:29:37,418 --> 00:29:39,644
You made me take the sleeping pills.

431
00:29:39,923 --> 00:29:40,751
That’s why I don’t dream.

432
00:29:42,128 --> 00:29:43,205
So they work?

433
00:29:44,861 --> 00:29:46,189
Yes, they do.

434
00:29:47,758 --> 00:29:48,781
I sleep like a log.

435
00:29:50,612 --> 00:29:52,593
I took some before I came to see you.

436
00:29:53,970 --> 00:29:55,545
And now I’m getting sleepy.

437
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:57,655
I’m going to sleep.

438
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,423
Yeah.

439
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:03,513
Goodnight.

440
00:30:51,183 --> 00:30:53,577
J, you’re tough as nails.

441
00:30:54,013 --> 00:30:55,973
You got hit by a car,
and you’re already back in class.

442
00:30:56,217 --> 00:30:57,432
It just grazed me.

443
00:30:58,199 --> 00:30:59,085
Don’t overreact.

444
00:30:59,678 --> 00:31:01,573
How’s the lawsuit going?

445
00:31:02,549 --> 00:31:03,442
No idea.

446
00:31:04,157 --> 00:31:05,519
My dad’s handling it.

447
00:31:06,391 --> 00:31:07,748
I don’t want to deal with it. Total headache.

448
00:31:11,566 --> 00:31:12,351
Guys,

449
00:31:12,647 --> 00:31:15,361
the freshmen are working on their project.

450
00:31:15,361 --> 00:31:17,440
They need someone to model for them.

451
00:31:17,824 --> 00:31:19,280
They asked if you are interested.

452
00:31:20,727 --> 00:31:21,534
All of us?

453
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:23,976
Just one volunteer is fine.

454
00:31:23,976 --> 00:31:26,485
Your bodies are fire. They’re impressed.

455
00:31:28,647 --> 00:31:29,341
Then…

456
00:31:30,666 --> 00:31:31,341
I’ll pass.

457
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:33,079
Same. Pass.

458
00:31:33,654 --> 00:31:34,293
Not interested.

459
00:31:36,821 --> 00:31:38,062
So it’s the freshmen’s project, huh?

460
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:39,858
Who exactly?

461
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:41,384
Nina and her group.

462
00:31:41,384 --> 00:31:42,308
Do you know her?

463
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,437
Ah!

464
00:31:46,413 --> 00:31:47,882
She already has my contact.

465
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,425
Tell her to send me the details directly.

466
00:31:49,634 --> 00:31:51,278
Are you gonna charge a lot?

467
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:52,569
I’ll let her know.

468
00:31:53,197 --> 00:31:53,945
Not telling you.

469
00:31:54,451 --> 00:31:55,786
Nina can ask me herself.

470
00:31:56,239 --> 00:31:58,657
Have it your way then. I’ll pass it on.

471
00:32:00,976 --> 00:32:01,867
Ahem.

472
00:32:03,541 --> 00:32:06,080
A gallant man spotted.

473
00:32:06,498 --> 00:32:07,966
It’s called being friendly.

474
00:32:08,315 --> 00:32:09,542
I’m not gallant.

475
00:32:17,691 --> 00:32:18,428
It’s hot today.

476
00:32:22,595 --> 00:32:23,301
Hey, guys.

477
00:32:24,487 --> 00:32:25,715
Nina needs my body measurements.

478
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,477
You said yes just now.

479
00:32:28,616 --> 00:32:29,721
The project already started?

480
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:30,884
Yeah.

481
00:32:31,302 --> 00:32:32,411
I’m off now.

482
00:32:32,707 --> 00:32:33,625
Should I wait?

483
00:32:34,776 --> 00:32:36,038
It’s okay. It might take a while.

484
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:37,775
It’s fine. I can wait.

485
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:39,295
Really, it’s okay.

486
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:41,102
Nina said she’d treat me to a meal after.

487
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:42,050
You can leave without me.

488
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:44,457
Alright, I’m off then.

489
00:32:45,015 --> 00:32:45,888
See you.

490
00:32:49,288 --> 00:32:50,908
I think something’s up.

491
00:32:53,227 --> 00:32:54,146
Should we go?

492
00:32:54,669 --> 00:32:55,412
Yeah, let’s.

493
00:33:06,424 --> 00:33:08,686
WANT ME TO PICK YOU UP?

494
00:33:46,395 --> 00:33:47,745
You’re acting like a baby.

495
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:49,909
I’m not.

496
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,356
Look at my wound.

497
00:33:53,141 --> 00:33:54,759
It’s just a scrape.

498
00:33:55,927 --> 00:33:57,776
Do you seriously
need me to help you bathe?

499
00:33:58,247 --> 00:33:59,320
What a loser.

500
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:02,187
You helped me before.

501
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:05,165
That was when you broke your finger.

502
00:34:05,165 --> 00:34:08,682
And I wanted you to recover fast
so you’d go home.

503
00:34:12,553 --> 00:34:14,152
What about now?

504
00:34:14,723 --> 00:34:16,011
You don’t want me gone anymore?

505
00:34:17,075 --> 00:34:17,710
Hm?

506
00:34:20,029 --> 00:34:21,490
Bug me one more time,

507
00:34:21,664 --> 00:34:23,239
and I’ll drown you in the tub.

508
00:34:26,447 --> 00:34:27,138
Jinn.

509
00:34:27,661 --> 00:34:28,294
Yeah?

510
00:34:30,613 --> 00:34:31,886
When do you think…

511
00:34:33,752 --> 00:34:35,197
you’ll tell people about us?

512
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:39,176
You posted a photo like that.

513
00:34:40,728 --> 00:34:42,107
It’s basically public already.

514
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:43,993
I mean, with our parents.

515
00:34:46,835 --> 00:34:47,614
Right.

516
00:34:48,259 --> 00:34:49,941
I never really thought about it.

517
00:34:51,562 --> 00:34:53,222
But we have no reason to hide it.

518
00:34:53,885 --> 00:34:54,811
Except…

519
00:34:55,317 --> 00:34:56,042
Except what?

520
00:34:58,152 --> 00:34:59,140
It’s embarrassing.

521
00:34:59,489 --> 00:35:01,611
We hated each other
and then ended up together.

522
00:35:01,925 --> 00:35:04,935
Our moms will laugh
about it in this life and the next.

523
00:35:06,382 --> 00:35:07,339
You’ve got a point.

524
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,264
It’s so embarrassing.

525
00:35:10,728 --> 00:35:11,334
Mm.

526
00:35:13,043 --> 00:35:15,930
Is that all you’re planning to tell them?

527
00:35:18,249 --> 00:35:19,156
What do you mean?

528
00:35:21,213 --> 00:35:22,422
What about seeing the future?

529
00:35:22,823 --> 00:35:23,786
Are you telling them?

530
00:35:24,728 --> 00:35:26,410
I don’t know how to start.

531
00:35:30,981 --> 00:35:31,991
Let’s get you cleaned up.

532
00:35:44,665 --> 00:35:45,931
Van is skipping?

533
00:35:46,088 --> 00:35:47,651
He didn’t come back last night.

534
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:49,300
Gosh.

535
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,551
Did taking body measurements
require spending the night?

536
00:36:17,823 --> 00:36:18,676
Van is skipping?

537
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:20,443
I don’t know.

538
00:36:25,879 --> 00:36:27,426
You guys aren’t sharing the place anymore?

539
00:36:27,764 --> 00:36:29,436
He didn’t come back last night.

540
00:36:33,037 --> 00:36:34,307
He behaved for three days,

541
00:36:35,137 --> 00:36:36,690
and now his true colors are back?

542
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:40,665
Here he comes.

543
00:36:41,155 --> 00:36:41,891
Gosh.

544
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:50,013
Did taking body measurements
require spending the night?

545
00:36:55,388 --> 00:36:58,021
It got late, so I crashed at a friend’s place.

546
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,952
It had nothing to do with Nina.

547
00:36:59,952 --> 00:37:02,083
Oops, I didn’t even mention Nina.

548
00:37:02,370 --> 00:37:04,829
You were insinuating, dude. I can tell.

549
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:17,982
And that was the god of fury.

550
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,397
I’ll be right back.

551
00:37:20,397 --> 00:37:21,241
Be right back.

552
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:39,724
Don’t be mad.

553
00:37:39,944 --> 00:37:40,536
Mm.

554
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:43,755
I’m really sorry.

555
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:46,506
Don’t you think you use
that word a little too often?

556
00:37:46,861 --> 00:37:48,478
Nothing happened.

557
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,339
We just had a late-night meal.

558
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:53,015
And my friend lives near the restaurant,

559
00:37:53,269 --> 00:37:54,774
so I decided to crash there.

560
00:37:55,028 --> 00:37:56,329
You didn’t answer my messages.

561
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,964
My phone died.

562
00:37:59,353 --> 00:37:59,987
Oh, yeah?

563
00:38:02,032 --> 00:38:03,784
You can ask me anything.

564
00:38:03,953 --> 00:38:05,575
I can explain everything.

565
00:38:06,437 --> 00:38:07,423
Anything?

566
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,160
Yes.

567
00:38:08,447 --> 00:38:09,254
Anything.

568
00:38:11,384 --> 00:38:12,840
Do you really want to be with me?

569
00:38:15,748 --> 00:38:17,285
Farm, don’t do this.

570
00:38:17,285 --> 00:38:18,218
I’m serious.

571
00:38:21,537 --> 00:38:23,219
Of course I do.

572
00:38:23,489 --> 00:38:25,018
I’m the one who
asked you to be my boyfriend.

573
00:38:26,286 --> 00:38:27,231
I love you.

574
00:38:29,868 --> 00:38:31,034
If we break up now,

575
00:38:32,014 --> 00:38:33,487
we could still go back to being friends.

576
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,975
Do we really need to go there?

577
00:38:39,448 --> 00:38:40,798
I just don’t want to lose you.

578
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,337
Think about it.

579
00:38:49,338 --> 00:38:50,088
I have thought about it.

580
00:38:51,576 --> 00:38:52,298
I’m not breaking up.

581
00:39:24,946 --> 00:39:25,901
- Boo!
- Jeez!

582
00:39:27,776 --> 00:39:28,729
Hey!

583
00:39:29,068 --> 00:39:29,816
Hi.

584
00:39:30,712 --> 00:39:32,035
Did you have something to do around here?

585
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:34,851
Yes. We came to buy some fabrics,
so we stopped by.

586
00:39:35,815 --> 00:39:37,609
- Hi, Auntie Jan.
- Hi, dear.

587
00:39:38,556 --> 00:39:40,596
You two are always together these days.

588
00:39:40,664 --> 00:39:42,117
Are you hungry? I can order something.

589
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:54,245
Jinn, what’s wrong?

590
00:39:56,172 --> 00:39:57,052
Ah…

591
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:59,179
That suit looks familiar.

592
00:40:04,284 --> 00:40:05,326
Uh…

593
00:40:08,538 --> 00:40:11,617
It’s the same one
your dad wore on the news that day.

594
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:13,433
Mom.

595
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:15,901
His secretary brought it in.

596
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:18,189
I was hired to work on it.

597
00:40:19,355 --> 00:40:20,816
How long has he been in touch with you?

598
00:40:21,864 --> 00:40:22,566
Well.

599
00:40:24,409 --> 00:40:26,403
This is the third suit of his.

600
00:40:26,555 --> 00:40:27,144
Third?

601
00:40:28,598 --> 00:40:29,650
Has he ever come in?

602
00:40:33,251 --> 00:40:34,979
His secretary handles everything.

603
00:40:38,242 --> 00:40:40,123
What is he thinking?

604
00:40:41,678 --> 00:40:42,777
Just forget it.

605
00:40:42,777 --> 00:40:43,468
Don’t mind him.

606
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,424
Think of him as a customer.

607
00:40:50,310 --> 00:40:51,872
Someone’s coming in.

608
00:40:52,193 --> 00:40:54,880
Go wait in the room. I’ll call you down later.

609
00:40:55,235 --> 00:40:57,167
Hi, welcome.

610
00:40:58,232 --> 00:41:00,364
Are you looking for something?

611
00:41:01,294 --> 00:41:02,849
I do have that.

612
00:41:11,714 --> 00:41:14,007
Do you want to go to the beach after exams?

613
00:41:16,897 --> 00:41:17,572
What?

614
00:41:17,842 --> 00:41:19,262
Why are we going to
the beach all of a sudden?

615
00:41:20,192 --> 00:41:21,933
You’ve seemed moody lately.

616
00:41:25,043 --> 00:41:27,097
Look at everything
that’s been thrown into my life.

617
00:41:27,198 --> 00:41:28,507
It’s overwhelming.

618
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:30,281
It’s hard to force a smile.

619
00:41:41,614 --> 00:41:42,653
Where are my scissors?

620
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:44,932
They might be outside.

621
00:41:45,304 --> 00:41:46,302
I’ll get them for you.

622
00:42:02,315 --> 00:42:04,069
Go. Just leave for now.

623
00:42:05,371 --> 00:42:06,719
Jan, wait— hold on.

624
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:09,880
- Just leave.
- Slow down.

625
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,725
Did you find them?

626
00:42:12,111 --> 00:42:13,001
Out, please.

627
00:42:18,427 --> 00:42:19,323
What the hell are you doing?

628
00:42:20,134 --> 00:42:21,062
I just realized something.

629
00:42:21,992 --> 00:42:22,620
Realized what?

630
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,551
A way to make you feel better.

631
00:42:27,312 --> 00:42:27,812
What?

632
00:42:27,998 --> 00:42:28,660
J!

633
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:39,536
Is this what you want?

634
00:42:40,128 --> 00:42:41,124
Do you have a problem?

635
00:43:08,182 --> 00:43:11,800
J, you’re not like this because of me, right?

636
00:43:12,764 --> 00:43:14,247
Please be okay.

637
00:43:14,585 --> 00:43:18,513
I swear I’ll be here
annoying you for a very, very long time.

638
00:43:18,952 --> 00:43:19,797
The fierceness in his eyes.

639
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:22,023
I’m scared. Please, help me.

640
00:43:22,023 --> 00:43:23,385
Let go of Van’s arm already.

641
00:43:23,385 --> 00:43:25,488
This stupid oil is splashing everywhere.

642
00:43:25,843 --> 00:43:27,259
We can just order food.

643
00:43:27,377 --> 00:43:29,566
No. I want to cook for you.

644
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:31,498
I don’t know how serious you are about us.

645
00:43:32,208 --> 00:43:35,377
But for me, I want it to work.

646
00:43:45,374 --> 00:43:46,663
I’ll be fine.

647
00:43:53,651 --> 00:43:55,247
I’m not letting anything happen to you.

648
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,350
I love you.

649
00:44:01,886 --> 00:44:03,157
Do you love me?

650
00:44:03,157 --> 00:44:04,191
I’ve always loved you.

651
00:44:06,016 --> 00:44:07,173
Ever since we were seven.
