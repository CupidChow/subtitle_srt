1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm drunk.

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The light in the flower

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
is waiting for the flowers to bloom and the stars to meet.

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The Legend of Chusen

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Episode 14

6
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
The Heavenly Lord is just like that.

7
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Now, it's all under my feet.

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Since that's the case,

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
let's just use it.

10
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Uncle!

11
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Uncle!

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The Heavenly Lord sent you two

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
to help me.

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You're so beautiful.

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You're so beautiful.

16
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
You haven't changed at all

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
in your life.

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You're still so lovely.

19
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
The nine tails wish to be true.

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Is that true?

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Of course.

22
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The nine tails are the most important symbol

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
in the Northern Immortal Realm.

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But...

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I can't grow nine tails.

26
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Then you can wish to be like my nine tails.

27
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You can grow nine tails.

28
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes.

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Ah Jiu.

30
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
It took me so long to understand

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
that the nine tails

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
are not the symbol of identity.

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
The so-called nine tails

34
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
are just the reputation and status

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
of the nine tails

36
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
that will rule the Northern Immortal Realm.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
The nine tails

38
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
are just a kind of responsibility

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
to protect and curse.

40
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Why are you still talking nonsense with me?

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Run! Run!

42
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I thought

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
if you can't grow nine tails,

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
you can escape from the Great Wall.

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
But who knows

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
that the nine tails

47
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
can still escape.

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
The nine tails are the symbol of identity.

49
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I will sacrifice my life

50
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
to catch the soul of the fire

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and make a great effort.

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I'm willing to be the nine tails

53
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
for the sake of the Great Wall.

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
No.

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'm willing to be the nine tails

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
for the sake of the Great Wall.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm willing to be the nine tails

58
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
for the sake of the Great Wall.

59
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
No.

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
No.

61
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
No.

62
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
What are you doing, Luo Yao?

63
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
You're absorbing my energy.

64
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
You will be in a state of chaos.

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Let alone your Three-Sister Fire,

66
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
you will burn your own soul

67
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
to the ground.

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Luo Yao, stop.

69
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm willing to be the nine tails

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
for the sake of the Great Wall.

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Luo Yao,

72
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
don't do such a cruel thing to me.

73
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Stop.

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Kunlun,

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
have you forgotten about the matter with Wu Zhang?

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
There is no end to resentment.

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You can only use your body as a container

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
to absorb your energy.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
No.

80
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Luo Yao, I disagree.

81
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
If you do this, I will hate you.

82
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
If I don't forgive you, I will follow you.

83
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I will scold you.

84
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I will scold you for being cold-blooded.

85
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
No.

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's too cruel to ask you to help me.

87
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Let the Three-Sister Fire

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
be my last gift.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
No, Luo Yao.

90
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
I'm talking nonsense.

91
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Stop. I'm begging you.

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Let me absorb my energy, okay?

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Luo Yao, no.

94
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Sister.

95
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Sister.

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Sister.

97
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Stop.

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I finally hear you call me sister.

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Kunlun,

100
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
if there is a future,

101
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I will tell you earlier.

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm happy for you.

103
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Kunlun.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You don't have a chance.

105
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'm worried about him.

106
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Then why did you save me?

107
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Don't you know it's dangerous?

108
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
If...

109
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm lucky.

110
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Luo Yao, don't.

111
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Don't.

112
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Now I only have you.

113
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Please go back with me.

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
The North Star Sword needs you.

115
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You and the North Star Sword

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
have nothing to do with me.

117
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't have a sister.

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't have a family.

119
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
No.

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
You can never be my family.

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Forever.

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Jiu.

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Jiu.

124
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm young, I'm old.

125
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I'm old.

126
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I'm old.

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Jiu.

128
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Luo Yao.

129
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Luo Yao.

130
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
Qin Xiao.

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You should have told me earlier.

134
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm sorry.

136
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Qin Xiao.

139
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Do you know

140
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
if I didn't show mercy to you

141
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
and not accept my enemy as my father for ten thousand years?

142
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Qin Xiao.

143
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Do you really hate me so much?

144
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
She's so beautiful.

145
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
It's so beautiful.

146
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
So beautiful.

147
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Qin Xiao.

148
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Qin Xiao.

149
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,200
Brother, why are you coming?

150
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:56,160
Ok,

151
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
I was born in the Heaven Fire.

152
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,160
I was born by the God's will.

153
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:05,160
I was born for the Heaven and Earth.

154
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,160
Li Chang.

155
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,160
What's your grudge?

156
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,160
Why are you so dissatisfied?

157
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,160
Why do you involve so many innocent people?

158
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,160
In the Garden of Flower,

159
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Hou Ning helped you escape.

160
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,160
In the Flower Palace, Jin Xiu saved your life.

161
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,160
You're so dissatisfied.

162
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,160
Let me ask you.

163
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
What did the people of Wuzhang State do to you?

164
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,160
What did the disciples of Cangwu Mountain do to you?

165
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
What did Lu Yao do to you?

166
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,160
You caused them to lose their lives and have no home to return to.

167
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,160
You caused the disciples of Cangwu Mountain to lose their lives.

168
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,160
You caused Lu Yao to be destroyed.

169
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Wait.

170
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,880
Thought so.

171
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,160
Only the Wen clan have bygone benefactor like God Kunlun

172
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,160
the strongest of all the world's cultures.

173
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,200
Juanjie.

174
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:28,440
You're not a coward.

175
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,240
Send for me.

176
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,400
I won't fight you anymore!

177
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,040
Bai Chen'an

178
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,880
killed my sister.

179
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:51,640
Even if I get frozen in a river,

180
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,280
I won't let you get so hard!

181
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,160
Come on.

182
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,760
Let go of the hatred in your heart.

183
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,560
The more hatred in my heart,

184
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,760
the stronger I will be.

185
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,160
Jinxiu, slow down.

186
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:30,560
Slow down.

187
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,560
Let me see.

188
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:34,960
Where did this hair thief come from?

189
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,560
Father, mother.

190
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:39,960
Mother,

191
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
the red tea you gave me has bloomed.

192
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,760
I didn't let you down.

193
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,360
I took good care of it.

194
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,560
Do you like it?

195
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,160
Yes.

196
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
I like it.

197
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,560
I like it.

198
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:51,760
I like it.

199
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
I like it.

200
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
I like it.

201
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
I like it.

202
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
Father,

203
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,760
I didn't steal the flower.

204
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
A gentleman loves flowers.

205
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,360
It's right to take it.

206
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,360
The blooming red tea flowers

207
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,360
are all the heart of our Jinxiu.

208
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,760
I like it very much.

209
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,560
This place

210
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,560
is not a place where real things happen.

211
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,160
It's not a simple fantasy.

212
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,160
This is not what you think

213
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,160
and what you think.

214
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,960
This is not a place for you to get the feeling that

215
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,360
there is a mutual attraction between us.

216
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,560
I like it so much.

217
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,160
I'm lonely.

218
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,360
Want to take you home?

219
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,360
No

220
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,760
I have to help.

221
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,360
No

222
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,160
People will die because if you donate the flower to us,

223
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,960
we will do everything you want.

224
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,320
And since you were born with spiritual ability,

225
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,160
then you have to train hard and grow up soon.

226
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,560
And we can be with you forever.

227
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,200
Are myия with Hongning

228
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,640
because of Mo Qing?

229
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,240
Come on in.

230
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,360
You should just stay in my palace.

Although our Flower Tribe has no resistance,

we have the power to keep going.

247
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,400
Even if we are hit,

248
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,080
we don't have to be afraid.

00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
You are awake.

I'm here to see you.

I'm here to see you.

299
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,400
I have so many things to tell you.

300
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
But I can't begin to tell you.

301
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,400
I'm very anxious.

302
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,400
It's okay.

303
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,400
You can tell me slowly in the future.

304
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,400
Is this what I think and think in my heart?

305
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Jinxiu.

306
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,400
Jinxiu.

307
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,400
Jinxiu.

308
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,400
Jinxiu, where are you?

309
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,400
I lost you again.

310
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
I don't know what I would do to you.

311
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
Jinxiu.

312
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
Jinxiu.

313
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,400
Jinxiu.

314
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,400
Jinxiu.

315
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,400
Take me to find him.

316
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,400
This is Jinxiu and me.

317
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Jinxiu.

318
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
Jinxiu.

319
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,400
Jinxiu.

320
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,400
Jinxiu.

321
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
This is what you think.

322
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,400
This is not true.

323
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,400
You will be trapped in there.

324
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,400
Come out.

325
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,400
Jinxiu.

326
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,400
This is not the real world.

327
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,400
This is not your life.

328
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,400
Come with me.

329
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
You can't stay here.

330
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,400
The immortals and demons coexist here.

331
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,400
The peace and harmony are always in the same place.

332
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,400
Why can't Jinxiu stay?

333
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
Jinxiu wants the immortals and demons to coexist.

334
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:51,400
The three realms are peaceful.

335
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,400
I can accompany him.

336
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
I can do everything.

337
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
If all this is fake,

338
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
what does he want?

339
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:05,400
What he wants and what he wants are all here.

340
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,400
Why do you want him to leave?

341
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
Jinxiu.

342
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,400
We exist in this world.

343
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
Everything we think and think

344
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
is our present.

345
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,400
The pain and suffering you have experienced,

346
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
good and bad,

347
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
happy and unhappy,

348
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
they are all you.

349
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,400
You want to take them away from you.

350
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:34,400
You deny the meaning of our existence in this world.

351
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,400
You are not complete.

352
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
You are not you, Jinxiu.

353
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
Without me,

354
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
he can be willing to

355
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
turn the mountain into a river with his blood.

356
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
This is the price to pay

357
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
to protect the three realms.

358
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
Why don't you go by yourself?

359
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
You want Jinxiu to sacrifice

360
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
for the sake of your own desire.

361
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
How can there be such a principle in this world?

362
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
Life is hard.

363
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,400
Death is painful.

364
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,400
The immortals and demons come from heaven and earth.

365
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,400
Then they have to go back to heaven and earth.

366
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
Why do you want to

367
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
force Jinxiu to die?

368
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
You are going to go back to heaven and earth.

369
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
You will regret it.

370
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
Jinxiu will regret it too.

371
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
With the hands of the one I love,

372
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
there is no regret.

373
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,400
Ji Ning.

374
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
If this can be broken,

375
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,400
there is no responsibility in your heart.

376
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,400
This is the limit of life

377
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,600
that you can't capture by cut.

378
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,200
I only need to

379
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,400
try my best and just change.

380
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
Thank you.

381
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,400
Sorry.

382
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm just a small red silk with little power.

383
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,160
But I have the time

384
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,320
to complete the task

385
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,520
that no one can replace.

386
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,440
Jinxiu,

387
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,240
all lives are waiting for you.

388
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,100
You still have greater responsibilities.

389
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:48,180
�

390
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,880
Hurry and go!

391
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,220
Okay, I'll go.

392
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,400
Wake up.

393
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Don't forget Shan He Jin Xiu.

394
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,160
Your master.

395
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,400
You are the one who saved me.

396
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,400
You are the one who saved me.

397
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,400
You are the one who saved me.

398
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,400
You are the one who saved me.

399
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,400
You are the one who saved me.

400
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,400
You are the one who saved me.

401
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,400
I have been looking for you.

402
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,400
It's my turn to take it back.

403
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,400
Your life-saving grace is not yet over.

404
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,400
You have to take it back.

405
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,400
I will take it back.

406
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,400
I will take it back.

407
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
I will take it back.

408
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,400
I will take it back.

409
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
I will take it back.

410
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,400
How can you be so cruel?

411
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,400
No.

412
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,400
I will take it back.

413
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,400
You still want to fool me?

414
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,400
I have lost everything.

415
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,400
Killing you is more important than my life.

416
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,400
The gods have their own plans.

417
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,400
The demons also have their own plans.

418
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:20,400
The immortals and demons all have their own desires.

419
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,400
You dare to say that your immortals are sacred?

420
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,400
If it's not your dirty heart,

421
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,400
how can it be used by my Jiao Rong Sword?

422
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:37,400
I only want that nothing has changed since the beginning.

423
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,400
The battle of Xianyou a hundred years ago,

424
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,400
countless deaths and injuries,

425
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,400
bloodshed and bloodshed,

426
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:51,400
the sadness of the demons and the wildness.

427
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,400
In this battle,

428
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:59,400
I only want that nothing has changed.

429
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,400
I have dedicated my emotions to the gods

430
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,400
for the sake of the gods.

431
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
I have prayed for the gods

432
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,400
and re-created the order of the three realms.

433
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,400
From now on,

434
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,400
Xianyou will be separated from the world

435
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,400
and be rid of the chaos.

436
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,400
The great path is only a path.

437
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,400
The great path is only a path.

438
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,400
The great path is only a path.

439
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,400
The law of the heaven and the earth is the first.

440
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,400
I want absolute order.

441
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,400
It can't be subdued.

442
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
That's your law.

443
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,400
It's not the law of the heaven and the earth.

444
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,400
You made the judgment.

445
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,400
Since the beginning of the heaven and the earth,

446
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:54,400
the immortals, demons and humans have been established.

447
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,400
There is a reason for it to exist.

448
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,400
Why did these things happen?

449
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,400
It's because these demons

450
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,400
have been born with hatred

451
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,400
and have been born with panic.

452
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,400
They will never leave

453
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,400
and turn into these dirty hatreds.

454
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,400
This is my three realms.

455
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,400
The evil you said

456
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,400
is just because they were born as demons.

457
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,400
Open your eyes and see.

458
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,400
Now the hatred is full and the two worlds are divided.

459
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,400
Is this the three realms you want?

460
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,400
Is this the three realms

461
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,400
that you have to pay so much for

462
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,400
and turn me into a mountain and river?

463
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,400
Ten thousand years ago,

464
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,400
the Heaven and the Earth's supreme ruler

465
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,400
came to me

466
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,400
and re-established the three realms.

467
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,400
It will bring unexpected consequences.

468
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,400
If I know the truth,

469
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:22,400
I will return the body to the body.

470
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,400
I will return the body to the body.

471
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,400
I will return the body to the body.

472
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,400
You can break the bitter scene set by my body.

473
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,400
I have no place to turn.

474
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,400
I can

475
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:57,400
take away the pain of the past.

476
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,400
But

477
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,400
I still hope that

478
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,400
for the three realms,

479
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,400
for the people,

480
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,400
the blood of Qilin on you

481
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,400
will be sprinkled on the three mountains and the five rivers.

482
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:34,400
It will dissolve the grudge

483
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:37,400
that will never disappear.

484
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,400
If it's for the peace of the world,

485
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
I have nothing to hesitate about.

486
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,400
I will do it myself.

487
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,400
Jinxiu,

488
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,400
I will do it myself.

489
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,400
Don't you really hate me?

490
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,400
You don't?

491
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
Jinxiu,

492
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,400
you are really a good girl.

493
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,400
You are really a good girl.

494
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,400

You are really a good girl.

496
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,400
You are really a good girl.

497
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,400
You are really a good girl.

498
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
You are really a good girl.

499
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,400
You are really a good girl.

500
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,400
You are really a good girl.

501
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,400
You are really a good girl.

502
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,400
You are really a good girl.

503
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,400
You are really a good girl.

504
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,400
You are really a good girl.

505
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,400
You are really a good girl.

506
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,400
You are really a good girl.

507
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,400
You are really a good girl.

508
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,400
You are really a good girl.

509
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,400
You are really a good girl.

510
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,400
You are really a good girl.

511
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,400
You are really a good girl.

512
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,400
You are really a good girl.

513
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,400
You are really a good girl.

514
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,400
You are really a good girl.

515
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,400
You are really a good girl.

516
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
You are really a good girl.

517
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,400
You are really a good girl.

518
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,400
You are really a good girl.

519
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,400
You are really a good girl.

520
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,400
You are really a good girl.

You are really a good girl.

541
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,400
You are really a good girl.

542
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,400
You are really a good girl.

543
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:07,400
You are really a good girl.

544
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,400
You are really a good girl.

545
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,400
You are really a good girl.

546
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,400
You are really a good girl.

547
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,680
Bai Chang,

548
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,520
for the sake of the same selfish desire,

549
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,400
you started this battle of Deity and Demigod,

550
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:20,860
and caused the sin in three realms,

551
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,860
so you are still stoping now.

552
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,220
It's me?

553
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,960
If it wasn't because of you Students,

554
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,260
why would I be beaten?

555
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,260
There is no divinities with Town Master to kill,

556
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,260
did have many every once in a lifetime.

557
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,260
Those hateful and humiliated Immortals,

558
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,260
even are no longer alive.

559
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,120
Do you know how 수가's weight of pain

560
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:42,120
is furniture layer on her widowet there.

561
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,720
Demon, how could you treat me as the Demon King?

562
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:52,320
It's all your fault.

563
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,320
It's your fault!

564
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,920
Take your grudges.

565
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,320
With your grudges, you won't be able to defeat him.

566
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,920
Focus!

567
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,320
You...

568
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:11,520
What I want is to protect you.

569
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:17,120
Now that it has come to this, you still dare to mention him?

570
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:18,720
Oh, falling flowers,

571
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:25,120
I will meet you again and again.

572
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:31,520
Please give me your name for a lifetime.

573
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,920
I still remember that day when we were happy.

574
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:44,120
Before the flowers bloom, my heart is filled with affection.

575
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:50,920
I will accompany you to travel around the world and enjoy the wind and rain.

576
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:57,320
Please give me your name for a lifetime.

577
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:03,920
I still remember that day when we were happy.

578
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:10,120
Before the flowers bloom, my heart is filled with affection.

579
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:16,720
I will accompany you to travel around the world and enjoy the wind and rain.

580
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:23,320
I wish to chase after the love and passion.

581
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:29,720
I can only dream of you in my dreams.

582
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:36,120
Even if time is merciless and I can't let go of my past,

583
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:44,320
I will still think of you and keep you in my heart.
