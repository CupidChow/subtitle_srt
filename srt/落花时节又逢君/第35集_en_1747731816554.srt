1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,080
Ahhâ€¦

2
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:56,360
Who cares about Cool Otherwise my heart turns into where it belongs

3
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,360
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,360
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,360
I'm sorry.

7
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,360
I'm sorry.

8
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,360
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,360
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,360
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,360
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,360
I'm sorry.

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,360
I'm sorry.

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,360
I'm sorry.

15
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,360
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,360
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,360
I'm sorry.

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,360
I'm sorry.

19
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,360
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,360
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,360
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,360
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,360
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,360
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,360
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,360
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,360
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,360
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,360
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,360
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,360
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,360
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:27,360
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,360
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,360
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,360
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,360
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,360
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,360
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,360
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,360
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,360
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,360
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,360
I'm sorry.

45
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,360
I'm sorry.

46
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,360
I'm sorry.

47
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,360
I'm sorry.

48
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,360
I'm sorry.

49
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,360
I'm sorry.

50
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,360
I'm sorry.

51
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
I'm sorry.

52
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,360
I'm sorry.

53
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
I'm sorry.

54
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,360
I'm sorry.

55
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
I'm sorry.

56
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,360
I'm sorry.

57
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
I'm sorry.

58
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,360
I'm sorry.

59
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,360
I'm sorry.

60
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,360
I'm sorry.

61
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,360
Why aren't you going?

62
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:06,360
Royal Father!

63
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:22,360
Royal Father-

64
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,360
I am a woman that I love.

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:32,360
I beg you. I hope you can allow our marriage.

66
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,360
I have been an emperor for tens of thousands of years.

67
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:41,360
I have never held a family dinner.

68
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,360
Do you know why?

69
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,360
Because it will make you weak.

70
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,360
Now, I agree to your family dinner.

71
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,360
That is for your tolerance and connection.

72
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:59,360
But it is not a honor.

73
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,360
You have been back for a long time.

74
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,360
You still don't understand.

75
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,360
You still have short sight.

76
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,360
You still have a long way to go.

77
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,360
You still have short sight.

78
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,360
You don't care about the big picture.

79
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,360
Do you think the stars in the sky and the stars in the earth are in the sky

80
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,360
to let you understand the love of the world?

81
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,360
Wrong!

82
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,360
It is to let you understand that there are many disputes in the world.

83
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,360
Only order, fairness and justice are the irreversible truth.

84
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Father.

85
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,360
What I want is to work with the one I love.

86
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,360
I never thought of taking a break.

87
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,360
You don't have the right.

88
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,360
I don't want to be alone.

89
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:19,360
I don't want to be alone.

90
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,360
I don't want to be alone.

91
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,360
I don't want to be alone.

92
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,360
I don't want to be alone.

93
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,360
I don't want to be alone.

94
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,360
I don't want to be alone.

95
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:37,360
I don't want to be alone.

96
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,360
I don't want to be alone.

97
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,360
I don't want to be alone.

98
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,360
Your honor.

99
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,360
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:09,360
Maybe in His Majesty's heart, I'm not qualified to be your queen.

101
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,360
I'm just a god-giver of the heavens.

102
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,360
I have so many eyes on you.

103
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,360
If I become His Majesty, you will definitely become the most important person.

104
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,360
If there are some things that we can't avoid,

105
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,360
then we will face them together.

106
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,360
Are you really willing to do it?

107
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,360
If I'm not willing, why would I still be here?

108
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,360
It's done.

109
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,360
The painting exhibition is finally over.

110
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,360
You are a new god of painting.

111
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,360
You must work harder to improve your magic.

112
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,360
I will help you.

113
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,360
I will work hard to make you my queen.

114
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,360
Only then can I transfer my immortal powers to you.

115
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,360
But you are already injured.

116
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:36,360
I don't want you to do this.

117
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,360
Be good.

118
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,360
My cultivation speed is faster than yours.

119
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,360
Moreover, my cultivation will progress faster.

120
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,360
Cultivation?

121
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,360
Cultivation?

122
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,360
They said that they wanted to cultivate together.

123
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,360
Let's cultivate together.

124
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,360
Do you know that cultivating together is...

125
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,360
I was born because of love.

126
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,360
I not only want to repay the grace of the gods,

127
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,360
but also have developed love.

128
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,360
Cultivation?

129
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,360
I...

130
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,360
Cultivation

131
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,360
The inner spirit of the divine spirit

132
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,360
seems to have a feeling of being hindered.

133
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,360
Is this the inner spirit of the divine spirit?

134
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,360
What is the difference between it and the inner spirit?

135
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,360
Greetings, Your Majesty.

136
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,360
You took good care of this garden.

137
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,360
I should do this.

138
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,360
Do you know that in the Heaven Realm,

139
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,360
everything must be complete and complete,

140
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,360
so that you can enter the garden.

141
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,360
Then why is there still a garden here?

142
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,360
It is not easy to make a knot, and it is harder to go to heaven.

143
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,360
This place should be a place for those flowers to live.

144
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,360
If it is rotten, it is rotten.

145
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,360
Why should it be alive?

146
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,360
I left this garden.

147
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,360
It is a warning.

148
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,360
It is used to warn myself.

149
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,360
If I am soft-hearted,

150
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:04,360
it will become like this and become a dead end.

151
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,360
I do not know

152
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,360
that this garden has such a point.

153
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
Of course, you do not know.

154
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,360
No one knows.

155
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,360
This garden has become like this 10,000 years ago.

156
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:29,360
It was once a very outstanding and sacred place in the Heaven Realm.

157
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,360
Until now,

158
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,360
no one remembers its name.

159
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,360
Could it be related to Jinxiu's background?

160
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,360
May I ask where this fairy is?

161
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,360
She is already dead.

162
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:57,360
For the sake of the Three Realms, for the sake of the Central Plains,

163
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,360
she cannot be saved.

164
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,360
Your Majesty,

165
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,360
I have already made a choice.

166
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,360
I will not allow anything wrong to happen again.

167
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,360
I do not understand.

168
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,360
The Demon of the Black Tea.

169
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,360
I will not allow any wrong to happen again.

170
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,360
I do not understand.

171
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,360
I will not allow any wrong to happen again.

172
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,360
I will not allow any wrong to happen again.

173
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,360
The Demon of the Black Tea.

174
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,360
So you already knew.

175
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,360
She sees you as the destiny of the past.

176
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,360
Of course, I know.

177
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:46,360
I have been training Jinxiu for 10,000 years.

178
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,360
But she is still so weak and weak.

179
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,360
I am so disappointed.

180
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,360
What I saw today has left you behind.

181
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:58,360
This garden can become your home.

182
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,360
It is my grace to Jinxiu and you.

183
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,360
You want to kill me?

184
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,360
What grace are you talking about?

185
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,360
Your Majesty, did you not put justice and justice in your mouth?

186
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,360
I am a god because of merit.

187
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,360
Why should you kill me?

188
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:23,360
You are a god because of merit.

189
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,360
I need other reasons to kill you.

190
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,360
It is you.

191
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,360
It is you who gave Jinxiu the Soul-locking Bead.

192
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,360
He gave me the Soul-locking Bead and killed his own son.

193
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:51,360
He is not my son.

194
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,360
If he was not the Star of Heaven and Earth,

195
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,360
he would have been swallowed up by the Qilin Cave and destroyed.

196
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,360
Jinxiu!

197
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,360
Jinxiu!

198
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,360
Jinxiu!

199
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
Jinxiu!

200
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,360
Do not come near him.

201
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,360
Jinxiu!

202
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,360
Do not come near him.

203
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,360
He is lying.

204
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,360
He is always trying to harm you.

205
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,360
Everything he did was a fake.

206
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,360
Your Majesty,

207
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,360
Jinxiu!

208
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,360
Jinxiu!

209
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,360
Jinxiu!

210
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,360
Jinxiu!

211
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,360
Jinxiu!

212
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,360
Jinxiu!

213
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,360
Huan Yun, hurry up and do it!

214
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:50,360
Huan Yun!

215
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,360
Is this the person you want to marry?

216
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,360
Today, all of this is because of you!

217
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,360
You want to kill me, then kill me.

218
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
All of this...

219
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
is because of me.

220
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Shut up!

221
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,360
Shut up!

222
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,360
A demon that has infiltrated the Heavens and killed the Emperor is unforgivable!

223
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Pass my order!

224
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,360
Whoever disobeys the laws of the gods and the laws of the world,

225
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,360
behead him in front of the red tea demon!

226
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
Kill him!

227
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,360
Kill him!

228
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,360
Mother,

229
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,360
let's send Father back to the Heavens for treatment first.

230
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,360
No.

231
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,360
I want to see the King of the Heavens

232
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:37,360
deal with this evil demon myself!

233
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
What are you waiting for?

234
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,360
If you don't kill me,

235
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,360
I'll have you buried in the whole Hua Zhao Palace!

236
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,360
Your Excellency,

237
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,360
do you still not want to kill me?

238
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
Now,

239
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,360
I am also your enemy.

240
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,360
Do it.

241
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,360
Why?

242
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,360
Why must you do this?

243
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,360
If you have a grudge against me,

244
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,360
just kill me.

245
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,360
Your Excellency,

246
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,360
from now on,

247
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,360
we won't see each other.

248
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,360
Are you deaf?

249
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,360
Kill him!

250
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
Kill him!

251
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,360
Your Excellency,

252
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,360
goodbye.

253
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,360
Goodbye.

254
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,360
Your Excellency,

255
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,360
I will not let you die.

256
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,360
I will not let you die.

257
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,360
I will not let you die.

258
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,360
I will not let you die.

259
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,360
I will not let you die.

260
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,360
I will not let you die.

261
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,360
I will not let you die.

262
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,360
I will not let you die.

263
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,360
I will not let you die.

264
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,360
Your Excellency.

265
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,360
Brother,

266
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,360
you let him go! Do you know what the consequences are?

267
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,360
You think this is just a thunder?

268
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,360
You said that you would protect him.

269
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,360
I am afraid you won't even protect your own life!

270
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,360
If I don't protect him,

271
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:30,360
No one can protect her in this world.

272
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,360
She locked herself in her heart just for this moment.

273
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
Don't you understand?

274
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,360
She won't take the initiative to put on the lock-up thread.

275
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,360
She must have her own difficulties.

276
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,360
Difficulties?

277
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:55,360
What difficulties can she have?

278
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,360
She is a tea flower, a little demon, a bold and bold girl.

279
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,360
What else can she do?

280
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,360
You saw it just now.

281
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,360
Father was hurt by the demon's magic he hid.

282
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,360
How many things did he hide from you?

283
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,360
If you didn't use the metal to help him get out of the world,

284
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,360
you would have seen this lock-up thread.

285
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,360
Brother,

286
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:19,360
she is no longer the same Hong Ning.

287
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,360
She has been using you.

288
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,360
She is not like this.

289
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
Okay.

290
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,360
Then I ask you.

291
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,360
If she didn't take the initiative,

292
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,360
how could the lock-up thread get into her heart?

293
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,360
If she really loves you,

294
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,360
why didn't she just go against you in Zhong Tian City?

295
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,360
Instead, she locked herself in her heart to approach you in this way.

296
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,360
I don't believe you didn't notice it.

297
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,360
What kind of person is Hong Ning?

298
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,360
I know.

299
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,360
You know too.

300
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,360
I'm sorry.

301
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,360
I'm sorry.

302
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:21,360
I'm sorry.

303
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,360
I'm sorry.

304
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,360
I'm sorry.

305
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
I'm sorry.

306
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,360
I'm sorry.

307
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,360
I'm sorry.

308
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,360
I'm sorry.

309
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,360
I'm sorry.

310
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,360
I'm sorry.

311
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,360
I'm sorry.

312
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
I'm sorry.

313
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,360
I'm sorry.

314
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,360
I'm sorry.

315
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,360
King Kunlun.

316
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,360
This Fanuddha is being abandoned.

317
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,360
Now the 1800 Demons have inner struggles,

318
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
we can only use our hearts to pick up the Emperor's soul

319
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,360
while we find a way to fix this disaster.

320
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,360
I'll take a look.

321
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,960
No need, mother.

322
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,960
Your marriage has not been decided.

323
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,960
Don't say anything more exciting.

324
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,500
Hong Ning's demon power

325
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,500
has severely damaged father's internal organs.

326
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,060
Fortunately, father has an eternal body.

327
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,060
Otherwise, it would have been drowned.

328
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,160
The doctor

329
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,360
also put the divine power into father's body.

330
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,360
In a short period of time, he won't be in danger.

331
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,160
I'll go and check on him.

332
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,160
Okay.

333
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,160
I'll go and check on him.

334
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,160
Okay.

335
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,160
I'll go and check on him.

336
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,160
Okay.

337
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,160
I'll go and check on him.

338
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,160
I'll go and check on him.

339
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,160
Okay.

340
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,160
I'll go and check on him.

341
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,160
I'll go and check on him.

342
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,160
Okay.

343
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,960
How could this evil demon have such power?

344
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
When he was in Wu Zhang,

345
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:49,960
he absorbed a lot of demon power.

346
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,960
You knew he was Hong Ning long ago.

347
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,960
Your brother was deceived by that red tea demon.

348
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,960
You didn't go to stop him, but you let him down.

349
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
What do you think?

350
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,960
What should I do now?

351
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
I used the power of frost

352
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
to seal father's body.

353
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
But Hong Ning's demon power

354
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
has been damaged father's internal organs

355
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
and still has a strong power.

356
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
If I can't seal father's body,

357
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
I'm afraid I can't go back to heaven.

358
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
So

359
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,960
your father will be in a state of disarray at any time?

360
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,960
Yes.

361
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,960
I'm afraid your father can't imagine

362
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,960
that he was deceived by a red tea demon

363
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,960
who only knew about the heaven.

364
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,960
He was hurt by a red tea demon.

365
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,960
I'm afraid he can't imagine

366
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,760
that he was deceived by a red tea demon.

367
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,760
Jinxiu, where are you now?

368
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,760
My brother

369
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,760
was punished in the hall

370
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
when you and father came back.

371
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,760
You still call him brother?

372
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,760
He thought he would be punished

373
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760
by being punished.

374
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,760
Can this be over?

375
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,760
Ridiculous.

376
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,760
I'm sorry.

377
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,760
I'm sorry.

378
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:18,760
I'm sorry.

379
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,760
I'm sorry.

380
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,760
I'm sorry.

381
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
I'm sorry.

382
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,760
I'm sorry.

383
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,760
I'm sorry.

384
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,760
I'm sorry.

385
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,760
I'm sorry.

386
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,760
I'm sorry.

387
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:37,760
I'm sorry.

388
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,760
I'm sorry.

389
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,760
I'm sorry.

390
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,760
I'm sorry.

391
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,760
I'm sorry.

392
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:48,760
Father, are you okay?

393
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,760
I've been protecting father's primordial spirit for a while.

394
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,760
But the demon power of Hongning

395
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,760
is still continuing to attack.

396
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,760
If father's primordial spirit fails,

397
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:02,760
I'm afraid...

398
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,760
Did I let everyone down?

399
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,760
You are always the bridgehead of Zhong Tian.

400
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,760
In my heart,

401
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,760
you are always

402
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,760
my brother

403
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,760
no matter how I act.

404
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,760
If I hadn't insisted on bringing Hongning here,

405
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,760
all of this

406
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:37,760
wouldn't have happened.

407
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,760
If I hadn't insisted on bringing Hongning here,

408
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,760
I wouldn't have had to face this.

409
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,760
I would have been able to face this.

410
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,760
If I hadn't insisted on bringing Hongning here,

411
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,760
all of this

412
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:03,760
wouldn't have happened.

413
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,760
I would have been able to face this.

414
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:11,760
Brother,

415
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,960
Or should I take you to the flower garden first?

416
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,960
You only remember that you took me there.

417
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,960
You must have forgotten.

418
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,960
I begged you for a long time.

419
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,960
That's why you took me there.

420
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,960
Kunlun! Kunlun!

421
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,960
You promised me you wouldn't come.

422
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:30,960
What are you afraid of?

423
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,960
You're always so serious.

424
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,960
Are you tired?

425
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,960
You only said you wanted to take a look.

426
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,960
You didn't say you wanted to come in.

427
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,960
It's too dangerous.

428
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,960
Come back!

429
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,960
Anyway, the old man went to the forest to hunt animals.

430
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,960
He can't come back for a while.

431
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,960
What's wrong with playing for a while?

432
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:46,960
How about this?

433
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,960
You catch me and I'll go back with you.

434
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,960
Kunlun! Kunlun!

435
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:53,960
Dangerous!

436
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,960
You want to scare me again.

437
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,960
What's so dangerous about this?

438
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,960
Ah!

439
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,960
Do you know that this drawing stone can draw your magic and form?

440
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,960
If you fall down, you'll be destroyed.

441
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,960
Brother, what if I really fall down?

442
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,960
What can I do?

443
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,960
I'll jump down and save you.

444
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:31,960
If you fall down, I'll jump down and save you.

445
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:38,960
If we both fall down, how sad will father and mother be?

446
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,960
Father!

447
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
Father!

448
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,960
Kunlun, we're fine.

449
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,960
You're always like this.

450
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,960
You should risk your life for others.

451
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,960
But now you're in danger.

452
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:56,960
You're risking your life for others.

453
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:04,960
I should have done this.

454
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,960
But you want to take the responsibility.

455
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,960
That's why you're in this situation.

456
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,960
Hongning did it all by himself.

457
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:23,960
It was designed when you and he met again.

458
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,960
He approached you step by step.

459
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,960
He got your trust and returned to the Heaven Realm with you.

460
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,960
He planned all this.

461
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,960
Brother, you're never wrong.

462
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,960
But if you're really wrong,

463
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:50,960
the only mistake is that you love him too deeply.

464
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,960
That's why you're blinded.

465
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:03,960
But the hatred in his heart is all because of me.

466
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,960
If I could find out and explain it to him as soon as possible,

467
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,960
I would ask for his forgiveness.

468
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,960
Brother, you don't have to blame yourself.

469
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
If it's true, I'm also wrong.

470
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,960
I knew he was Hongning.

471
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,960
But I didn't expose him.

472
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,960
It's none of your business.

473
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,960
Brother.

474
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:42,960
Ke'lun.

475
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,960
I've been a fan of you since I was a child.

476
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:56,960
That's why you look so impatient.

477
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:05,960
Actually, you want me to succeed in the Heaven Realm.

478
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,960
In fact, no matter it's your cultivation or your power,

479
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,960
you're not under my control.

480
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:26,960
I know you're more suitable for the throne than me.

481
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:33,960
But I don't know what you're talking about.

482
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,960
Promise me.

483
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:44,960
Take good care of father and mother.

484
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,960
Zhong Tian's future is up to you.

485
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,960
Father.

486
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,960
Master.

487
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
Master.

488
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:18,960
Master.

489
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:28,960
Master.

490
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,960
Mother.

491
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:00,960
You dare to come again?

492
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,960
Mother.

493
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,960
Father is now dead.

494
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,960
I'm very worried.

495
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:14,960
I know it's all because of me.

496
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,960
I'm willing to sacrifice myself for you.

497
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,960
I'm willing to sacrifice myself for you.

498
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:29,960
I'm willing to sacrifice myself for you.

499
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,960
What did you say?

500
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:37,960
Father said that the spirit of the demon was damaged and vulnerable.

501
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,960
This method may not be successful.

502
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:44,960
But it can save your life.

503
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,960
It's useless to sacrifice yourself for the sake of the mortal.

504
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:56,960
You're not qualified to be the emperor.

505
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,960
I'm guilty.

506
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,960
I'm not qualified to inherit the throne.

507
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,960
I know it's all because of me.

508
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:12,960
I'm a man, but I'm still filial.

509
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:18,960
I can't think of any other way.

510
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:27,960
After this, I'll go to the mortal world.

511
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,960
Please allow me.

512
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,960
Mother.

513
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,960
My peony flower bloomed again.

514
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,960
Do you want to see it?

515
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,960
The body of the Lord of the Heavens is a golden peony.

516
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,960
This bloom is very short from the last time.

517
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,960
Your father and I just saw it.

518
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,960
It's a golden peony.

519
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
It's a golden peony.

520
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:52,960
It's a golden peony.

521
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:54,960
It's a golden peony.

522
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,960
It's a golden peony.

523
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,960
It's a golden peony.

524
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,960
It's a golden peony.

525
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
Your father and I just saw it.

526
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,960
We won't go there.

527
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,960
Okay.

528
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,960
Then mother, have a good rest.

529
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:11,960
Your Majesty.

530
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,960
Lord Kunlun has just learned the puppet trick.

531
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,960
Really?

532
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:16,960
Come with me to see it.

533
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,960
Mother.

534
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,960
You wait here for me.

535
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,960
When I come back, I'll go with you to see the new peony.

536
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:28,960
Yes, mother.

537
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:37,960
Now, I give the new peony to father for myself.

538
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,960
It's the best choice.

539
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,960
Mother knows me.

540
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,960
She will spoil me once.

541
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,960
Promise me.

542
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,960
Mother, you are back.

543
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,960
Why are you still here?

544
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,960
Mother said she would go to see brother first.

545
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,960
Then she came back to see my new peony.

546
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,960
I've been waiting here.

547
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,960
You are a flower tree.

548
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,960
It's natural to bloom.

549
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,960
There are 81 flowers.

550
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,960
Do I have to see them every time I bloom?

551
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:25,960
Mother.

552
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,960
This golden peony is different from the past.

553
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,960
What's the difference between the 81 flowers?

554
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,960
Mother.

555
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:54,960
This golden peony is because I think of your face.

556
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,960
It's just a peony.

557
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,960
How does it have anything to do with me?

558
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,960
Get up.

559
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,960
If you don't agree, I can't get up.

560
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,960
For the past ten thousand years, I've only prayed for you.

561
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,960
I beg you to allow me.

562
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,960
Get up and talk.

563
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,960
You said you never prayed for me in your life.

564
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,960
You remembered it wrong.

565
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:13,960
When you were 500 years old, you planted that golden peony.

566
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:15,960
You prayed for me.

567
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,960
Yes.

568
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,960
But I didn't come in the end.

569
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,960
Jinxiu.

570
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,960
I've been biased towards Kunlun since I was a child.

571
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,960
I'm very harsh on you.

572
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,960
I'm trying to control myself, but I'm not hiding it.

573
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,960
Have you ever thought about why?

574
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,960
Because I'm the eldest son.

575
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,960
I have hope.

576
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,960
That's why I'm strict with my family.

577
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,960
Do you really believe this ridiculous reason?

578
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,960
I dare not not believe it.

579
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,960
As long as mother is not satisfied, I must have done not enough.

580
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,960
So I've been thinking about it since I was a child.

581
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:21,960
I have to do everything harder than my brother.

582
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:31,960
I think if I do everything well, maybe mother will give me more love.

583
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,960
You didn't do anything wrong.

584
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:43,960
You did better than your father, Kunlun Jun, and any other god.

585
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,960
But what about this?

586
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,960
No matter how hard you try, no matter how hard you try,

587
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,960
you won't reduce my hatred for you.

588
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:02,960
Jinxiu, do you know that I hate you so much?

589
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,960
Every time you do more, I get more confused.

590
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,960
You are so reckless.

591
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:19,960
You are so reckless, but you make me so angry.

592
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:24,960
You are so cold to me.

593
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:31,960
It's just because you are not my son.

594
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,960
You have a feeling, don't you?

595
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:43,960
No matter how Jinxiu's body is, mother's ten thousand years of care,

596
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:48,960
I can't forget.

597
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
I can't forget.

598
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,960
I can't forget.

599
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:00,960
Jinxiu can't forget.

600
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,960
What I did today is just to prove your ten thousand years of guesswork.

601
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:17,960
I should have known that all your fights are just because you are afraid to prove your identity.

602
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,960
I'm sorry.

603
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,960
I'm sorry.

604
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,960
Thank you, mother.

605
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,960
What's there to thank?

606
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,960
I promised you.

607
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,960
I just wanted to drive you out of Zhong Tian selfishly.

608
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:56,960
I have one more thing to ask.

609
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,960
Say it.

610
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:07,960
I just want to drive you out of the way.

611
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,960
You heard it all?

612
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,960
Yes.

613
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:23,960
You don't look like you are angry at all.

614
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,960
I'm not angry, but I'm a close friend.

615
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,960
I can feel it.

616
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,960
You are hiding well.

617
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,960
Mother, although brother and I are not from the same family,

618
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,960
we are brothers after all.

619
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,960
We can't fake our friendship.

620
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,960
I beg you not to treat him like this.

621
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,960
What?

622
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,960
You think I'm too cruel to Jinxiu?

623
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,960
If I say no, then you know I'm lying.

624
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,960
You did all this for me.

625
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,960
You may want to ask me,

626
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,960
who in the three realms is the least qualified to say you are cruel?

627
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,960
The answer must be me.

628
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,960
But mother, have you ever cared about my feelings?

629
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
Have you ever asked me

630
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,960
if I wanted all this?

631
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,960
It's over.

632
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,960
It's too late to say anything.

633
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,960
If you don't pretend to be stupid,

634
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,960
you will take the responsibility soon.

635
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:29,960
Maybe everyone today doesn't have to go to this point.

636
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,960
Now, you have no intention to say anything.

637
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,960
Since you can't get everything back,

638
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,960
you can use the body of the person who punished you

639
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,960
to remove Jinxiu's body.

640
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,960
What?

641
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:59,960
It's you. At least you are his brother.

642
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:02,960
Even if you can reduce his pain,

643
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:07,960
maybe you are the only one who can do it for him.

644
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:10,960
You choose.

645
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:44,960
I will do it.

646
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,960
I will do it.

647
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,960
I will do it.

648
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,960
I will do it.

649
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,960
I will do it.

650
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,960
I will do it.

651
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,960
I will do it.

652
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,960
I will do it.

653
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,960
I will do it.

654
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,960
I will do it.

655
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,960
I will do it.

656
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,960
I will do it.

657
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:08,960
I will do it.

658
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,960
I will do it.

659
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,960
I will do it.

660
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,960
I will do it.

661
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,960
I will do it.

662
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,960
I will do it.

663
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,960
I will do it.

664
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,960
I will do it.

665
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,960
I will do it.

666
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:26,960
I will do it.

667
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,960
I will do it.

668
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,960
I will do it.

669
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:32,960
I will do it.

670
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,960
I will do it.

671
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,960
I will do it.

672
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,960
I will do it.

673
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,960
I will do it.

674
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,960
I will do it.

675
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,960
I will do it.

676
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,960
I will do it.

677
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,960
I will do it.

678
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,960
I will do it.

679
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,960
I will do it.

680
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,960
I will do it.

681
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,960
I will do it.

682
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,960
I will do it.

683
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,960
I will do it.

684
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,960
I will do it.

685
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:04,960
I will do it.

686
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,960
I will do it.

687
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,960
I will do it.

688
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,960
I will do it.

689
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,960
I will do it.

690
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,960
I will do it.

691
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,960
I will do it.

692
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,960
I will do it.

693
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,960
I will do it.

694
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:22,960
I will do it.

695
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,960
I will do it.

696
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,960
I will do it.

697
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,960
I will do it.

698
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,960
I will do it.

699
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,960
I will do it.

700
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,960
I will do it.

701
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,960
I will do it.

702
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,960
I will do it.

703
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,960
I will do it.

704
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,960
I will do it.

705
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,960
I will do it.

706
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,960
I will do it.

707
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,960
I will do it.

708
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,960
I will do it.

709
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,960
I will do it.

710
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,960
I will do it.

711
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,960
I will do it.

712
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,960
I will do it.

713
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,960
I will do it.

714
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,960
I will do it.
