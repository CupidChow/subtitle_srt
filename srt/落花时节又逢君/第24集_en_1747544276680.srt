1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,440
and��라

2
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,340
Who who for life

3
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:52,960
If I fall in love

4
00:00:58,040 --> 00:00:58,300
For a repeat

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,560
My plate's holes are covered in tears

6
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,800
I hold tatami mats behind my back

7
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:23,400
The attitude towards her evils appeals to me

8
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:30,600
For you, I'll follow my life

9
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,600
Let me be drunk

10
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:38,600
The name in the painting

11
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,600
Is waiting for the flowers to bloom and the stars to meet

12
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:01,400
Twenty-four

13
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Twenty-four

14
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:09,400
Twenty-four

15
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,400
Say it, what did you do this time?

16
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,400
OK, don't always show this face

17
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
It's more than my father

18
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
What's going on

19
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,400
What else can happen

20
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,400
That Mr. Si Shu can't get used to me

21
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
I was kicked out

22
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
What did you do this time

23
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,400
wronged

24
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,400
I didn't do anything

25
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,400
I just

26
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,400
just

27
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,400
just

28
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,400
Just helped other students

29
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,400
Find what they have been pursuing in their lives

30
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,400
For example

31
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,400
For example, what kind of Chinese herbs did I dig

32
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,400
We are

33
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,400
sleepy

34
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Wuzhang Temple University

35
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,400
You have been expelled for half a month and transferred to school three times

36
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,400
What are you doing

37
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,400
You don't know if you know it or not

38
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
Brother

39
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
You came to me this time

40
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,400
I'm sure I won't ask you about my study

41
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
You

42
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Don't you usually go to the temple of the goddess?

43
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Do you find anything strange

44
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
Why are you so concerned about the goddess all of a sudden

45
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,400
I tell you

46
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
Don't be so impulsive to the goddess

47
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,400
Otherwise, even if we are brothers

48
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,400
I will definitely follow you

49
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,400
I'm so annoyed

50
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,400
I'm not going to bow to the sky

51
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,400
Can you learn the idioms from Lu Jiu?

52
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Not tired

53
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Recently in the city

54
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,400
There are few cases of evil demons hurting people

55
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
There are four good demons in the month

56
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
The case of eliminating evil

57
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,400
You suspect that this four-dimensional case is not a coincidence

58
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Maybe it's the goddess

59
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
This city's evil disciple

60
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
The goddess personally did it

61
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,400
It's also abnormal

62
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,400
But after all, one god and one demon

63
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
Why is he so busy

64
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
You may be right

65
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,400
Behind these demons

66
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,400
There must be someone in charge

67
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
If it's not the goddess

68
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,400
Who is it

69
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,400
This demon is good

70
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,400
Why are you so obsessed with this

71
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,400
But Wu Zhangguo does not have this kind of rule

72
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,400
This rule of Wu Zhangguo

73
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,400
What does it mean to ordinary people?

74
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,400
This is not something that ordinary people can do

75
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,400
I'm not a demon

76
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,400
It's not something that ordinary people can do

77
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,400
If the person behind this is not a demon

78
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,400
Then it's the demon hunter

79
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,400
Yes, it must be the demon hunter

80
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400
It's better to stop talking

81
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,400
I have something to ask you

82
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,400
The sky and earth are in a trance for twenty years

83
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,400
Why is this

84
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,400
I never knew about his relationship with the sky and earth

85
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
I'm sorry

86
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,400
I didn't know

87
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,400
I didn't know

88
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,400
I didn't know

89
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:42,400
Where is the goddess now

90
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,400
And when will it appear

91
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Why are you here

92
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
The emperor cares about Jinxiu

93
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Why can't I care about Kunlun

94
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
You are ridiculous

95
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,400
If nothing else

96
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
I will go

97
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,720
If there's nothing else,

98
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,360
I'll take my leave.

99
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,680
A bunch of useless people!

100
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,160
Your Majesty, please calm down.

101
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,720
You can't even find the Heavenly Maid who was injured.

102
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,000
You can't even defeat a shadow.

103
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,600
What's the use of you if I want you?

104
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,640
Your Majesty,

105
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,000
we've turned the Northern Immortal Realm upside down.

106
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,560
I'm afraid she's no longer

107
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,760
in our position.

108
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,680
Could it be that the Heavenly Maid

109
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:56,960
has gone to the Western Sea to make a

110
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,520
What a cold-hearted person.

111
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,560
You don't care about your own father?

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Let me think about it.

113
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,320
I'll smash all the Heavenly Maid temples in the mortal world.

114
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,360
I want to see

115
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,160
how long the Heavenly Maid

116
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,600
who has been praying for the Qi's house will last.

117
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,640
When the bell rings, one will be born.

118
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,040
When the first is born, two will be born.

119
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,520
When the second is born, three will be born.

120
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,440
When the third is born, all things will be born.

121
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,960
When all things are blessed, the baby will be raised.

122
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,720
When the wind blows, the baby will be born.

123
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,960
Kunlun Jun.

124
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,240
Be quiet.

125
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,200
I sneaked out of the mansion.

126
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,200
You're grounded again?

127
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,560
Are you kidding me?

128
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,040
You all ran away.

129
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,840
The old man in the teaching school must hate me.

130
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,480
You ran into my mansion

131
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:47,680
and told my parents.

132
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,800
You deserve it.

133
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,760
If you're capable, don't listen to me.

134
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:51,440
Go back.

135
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,600
Go back to school now.

136
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,440
Seriously.

137
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,640
You sneaked out today

138
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,840
to find me?

139
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,040
I'm going to worship the Heavenly Maid.

140
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,120
I'm lucky to visit you.

141
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,160
On the way back,

142
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,960
I can go to the outskirts.

143
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,160
You can't go outskirts.

144
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:11,280
What's wrong?

145
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,120
My demon disciple

146
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,720
went to pick herbs on the mountain two days ago.

147
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,040
He was attacked by the evil spirit.

148
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,600
He almost died.

149
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,960
Luckily, a immortal teacher

150
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,760
saved his life.

151
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,640
Really?

152
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,080
Why should I lie to you?

153
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,520
Anyway, you'd better not go.

154
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,760
In case of danger,

155
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,640
you still expect the Heavenly Maid to save you?

156
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,280
Then...

157
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,440
What's the name of that immortal teacher?

158
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,640
A woman.

159
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,440
I think she's called...

160
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:33,880
What's her name?

161
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,000
Mu Xian.

162
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,840
Mu Xian?

163
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,760
I heard she's a

164
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,360
demon teacher who's good at evil and good at good.

165
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,320
Come back. Come back.

166
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,320
Brother.

167
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,280
Brother.

168
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,360
Jinxiu.

169
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,520
Jinxiu.

170
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,080
A message.

171
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,040
Something happened.

172
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,680
The seal has been removed.

173
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,160
The situation is not good.

174
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,080
Wait for him.

175
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,480
Remember.

176
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,720
These internal energy pellets

177
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,240
can only be used as a temporary core.

178
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,120
You don't have much time to revenge.

179
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,600
If there's a demon treasure,

180
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,600
no one can escape.

181
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:19,800
Jinxiu.

182
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,480
Jinxiu.

183
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,240
Jinxiu.

184
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,000
Jinxiu.

185
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:23,640
Jinxiu.

186
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,440
Jinxiu.

187
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,240
Jinxiu.

188
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,040
Jinxiu.

189
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,840
Jinxiu.

190
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:27,640
Jinxiu.

191
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,440
Jinxiu.

192
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,240
Jinxiu.

193
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,120
Jinxiu.

194
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,440
Jinxiu.

195
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,320
Jinxiu.

196
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,840
The King of Deception

197
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,840
Episode 16

198
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,680
General,

199
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,480
we're not in a hurry to get to the bear station.

200
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,440
Can we

201
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,600
take a rest here?

202
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,920
You're the one who wants to follow us.

203
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,040
Just rest if you're not afraid of death.

204
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,200
That's not what I meant.

205
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,760
I'm sent by the King of Deception.

206
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:00,720
Look.

207
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,080
You...

208
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,640
Lu Jing,

209
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,800
a few days ago,

210
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,400
a murder case happened nearby.

211
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,880
We can't stay here.

212
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,560
General,

213
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,600
I have something to tell you.

214
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,520
Our Ministry of Law

215
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,440
only cares about the evil spirits in the city.

216
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,600
Why are we taking such a risk

217
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,120
to investigate in the wilderness?

218
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,080
Do you know

219
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,600
how many cases of murder cases

220
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,800
have been reported in the suburbs?

221
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,080
How many people have died because of it?

222
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
In a month,

223
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,480
58 cases of evil spirits were reported.

224
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,920
123 people died because of it.

225
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,720
The Ministry of Law and the Ministry of Justice

226
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,320
are hiding their information.

227
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,120
We only see that

228
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,960
they're still fighting for the lives of several people.

229
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,960
If the King of Deception and the city are not investigating,

230
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,640
there must be a reason for them.

231
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,400
What reason?

232
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,400
They're all mortals.

233
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,240
Those officials

234
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,280
are rich and rich.

235
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,080
They're not like the people in the city.

236
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,680
They're not different.

237
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,680
You're right.

238
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,520
The house where the evil spirits lived

239
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,560
had more than 20 families.

240
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,200
Half of them died in a month.

241
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,280
The Taoist priest who came to do the ritual

242
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,760
was also badly injured.

243
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,200
His family was forced to move out of the place.

244
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,880
Some brave villagers in the neighborhood

245
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,320
moved in without believing the evil spirits.

246
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,840
The next day,

247
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,080
they became dead.

248
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,760
The evil spirits are so powerful.

249
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,680
They're going to kill us for sure.

250
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:34,880
They can only be people

251
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,840
with strong trust.

252
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
They're just400 legal Beach Gangs.

253
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,960
About 25 people died.

254
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,560
It's hard to see among them.

255
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,960
Those people have little face.

256
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,000
That's pretty good.

257
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,120
You're against him.

258
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,480
I know that

259
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,160
there shouldn't be such a big trouble.

260
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,360
Why do you let His Majesty

261
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
General, are we really going to live here?

262
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,360
Clean up the house.

263
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:18,760
St personnage

264
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:27,400
The masks aren't to bring in too much blood.

265
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,000
I'm Jin Xiu, a master of Wuzhang.

266
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,440
I only pass by here because it's late.

267
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,160
I'll stay here for a night and leave tomorrow.

268
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:37,880
It's too shallow here.

269
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,720
There's a mountain villa down the mountain.

270
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,120
You can go there.

271
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,520
May I ask if you're the owner of this place?

272
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,520
I'm just a servant.

273
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,240
I'm just a servant.

274
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,720
I'm just a servant.

275
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,120
I'm just a servant.

276
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,600
I'm just a servant.

277
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
I'm just a servant.

278
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
I'm just a servant.

279
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,240
But it's dangerous here.

280
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,040
If you insist on staying,

281
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
be careful.

282
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,880
Since it's dangerous,

283
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,920
why do you insist on staying?

284
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,080
What are you afraid of?

285
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,080
You're a girl.

286
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,400
How dare you be so ungrateful?

287
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,880
There are so many of us.

288
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,920
Even if there's a monster,

289
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,040
what's the matter?

290
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,400
Maybe

291
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,680
that monster is a pretty girl.

292
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,200
I was just about to meet her.

293
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,800
I was afraid she wouldn't come.

294
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,360
Go and pack up.

295
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,320
I think someone is here

296
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,520
to make a fake death case.

297
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,800
They're using the ghost god's name

298
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,320
to make a fool of Xuan Xu.

299
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,120
They're so useless.

300
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,860
Pourizz norma,

301
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,360
do your best.

302
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,300
Michelunintelligible

303
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,840
Thank you

304
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,020
Get out.

305
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,260
Get out.

306
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,980
Get out!

307
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:54,480
I am Wang Hu from the capital.

308
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,080
Why is she alone in her room?

309
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,840
If you have any difficulties,

310
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,880
just tell me.

311
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,880
As long as you can do it,

312
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,480
I will do my best.

313
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,080
Thank you.

314
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,440
I'm not talented.

315
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,040
But my family is well-known.

316
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,640
Now I work with the County Prince.

317
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,360
I'm a good talker in the city.

318
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:31,320
If you have no place to go,

319
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,280
why don't you...

320
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,640
I'll go back with you.

321
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:37,600
I think you're lonely.

322
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,080
It's better to find a place to go.

323
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,760
Jiang Qi, if you can do it,

324
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,240
I'll make sure you can do it.

325
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,080
Okay.

326
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,880
I'll go back with you.

327
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,920
Since you're so stubborn,

328
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,480
why don't we...

329
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,760
Ghosts!

330
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,680
There are ghosts!

331
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,960
Did you see her?

332
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,520
She's a girl.

333
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,640
There are no ghosts.

334
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,720
Where are the ghosts?

335
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,520
Where are they?

336
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,320
You're blind.

337
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,800
Isn't that...

338
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,520
The ghost...

339
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,600
She's...

340
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,560
Huang Hu.

341
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,560
You're drunk.

342
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,320
You're blind.

343
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,400
Sir, I...

344
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,600
I saw her change.

345
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,160
How can she be so blind?

346
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,040
She's the ghost in the house.

347
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,400
You said you wanted to catch the ghost.

348
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,040
But you drank too much and went to her room.

349
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
Now you think she's a ghost.

350
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,560
Do you know that?

351
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,920
Sir, think about it.

352
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:01,560
A girl lived in the middle of the mountain.

353
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,000
She's been killed.

354
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,520
She's the only one alive.

355
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,040
Isn't that weird?

356
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,320
She's so small.

357
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,040
She's not a ghost.

358
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,400
She's a monster.

359
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,440
If you want to kill her,

360
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,040
I'll catch her and...

361
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,120
Don't be rude.

362
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,480
Right, the ghost.

363
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,280
Why are you kidding her?

364
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,320
She's in a fight now,

365
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,960
and I can't come over.

366
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,280
Out of your way,

367
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,200
but you're asking me.

368
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,560
Since she's my lady,

369
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,480
I should ask first.

370
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:42,360
In case she gets angry at me.

371
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,240
Are you alone here?

372
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,240
Is there only you here?

373
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,240
Are you interrogating me?

374
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,240
You misunderstood.

375
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,240
If there are other people pretending to be ghosts,

376
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,240
it's good for you to find out the truth.

377
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,240
You are too many people. You insist on protecting the short.

378
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,240
I have no choice.

379
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,240
But you should know the truth.

380
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,240
Your people entered my room

381
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,240
and said I was a ghost.

382
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,240
You should apologize to me first

383
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,240
for saying I was a ghost and ruining my reputation.

384
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,240
A man broke into my room at night

385
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
and asked me to go back with him.

386
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,240
How dare he?

387
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,240
I'm Guan Jiao Buyan.

388
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:42,240
I apologize to you on behalf of him.

389
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
I apologize.

390
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,240
The so-called windless is not good.

391
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,240
The flies don't fly without a kite.

392
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,240
They are self-sufficient.

393
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,240
I'm Guan Jiao.

394
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,240
It's not a fly's choice

395
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,240
to fly without a kite.

396
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,240
And

397
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
things happen everywhere in the world.

398
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,240
Why should I hide?

399
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,240
I'm going to rest.

400
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,240
If there's nothing else, please go back.

401
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,240
It's dangerous here.

402
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,240
You'd better be careful.

403
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,240
Don't move alone.

404
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,240
Drink.

405
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,240
I can't drink.

406
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,860
Miss

407
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,860
Your Highness

408
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:51,460
What's happening?

409
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,460
So weird.

410
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:56,460
What should we do?

411
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,460
No傷痕

412
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,620
He is totally fine.

413
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,060
I heard he didn't hurt

414
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:11,060
They're not injured at all.

415
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:13,700
How do you know they're not injured at all?

416
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:15,300
They're all from Xiwu.

417
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,540
They should be fine.

418
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,140
I knew they'd be caught,

419
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,580
and then I somehow recognized them.

420
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,440
They were柱儿,

421
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:45,500
back then.

422
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,880
It was definitely that others are not actually.

423
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:48,780
I was a bit worried,

424
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,500
that they didn't need to know.

425
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,060
I was only worried a little.

426
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,500
As for those girls who never saw,

427
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,060
they knew everything then at night.

428
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,980
Look,

429
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,300
there wasn't a clarionなん taught by Master right before.

430
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,740
They didn't know you'd met them.

431
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,740
That's right,

432
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,500
there were things they didn't know.

433
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,740
From the least I could tell,

434
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,060
there was nothing I could teach you,

435
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:10,580
The criminal is still out of the prison.

436
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,860
If we can't get through

437
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,780
with these ghosts,

438
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,660
it will be a good match for her.

439
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,900
What ghosts?

440
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:19,820
It's all rumored.

441
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,420
I want to meet her.

442
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,660
It's okay if you want to see her.

443
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:26,660
But you will get others

444
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,380
involved if you lose your life.

445
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,780
You also think

446
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,300
it's a weird thing.

447
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,660
Why do you talk nonsense with her?

448
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,060
Do you have anything else to say?

449
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,060
You doubt me?

450
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,260
You taught us to be careful last night.

451
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,500
It must be a good thing.

452
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,300
The tiger is so strong.

453
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,060
And you were disrespectful to her last night.

454
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,060
You hate her.

455
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,420
It's logical.

456
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,540
The crime of the Yus is not a crime.

457
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,780
It's just your guess.

458
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,220
No evidence.

459
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,460
You even know the method of the crime.

460
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,980
When the tiger was found,

461
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,820
he was not dressed properly.

462
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,180
He was obviously seduced.

463
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,780
In this yard,

464
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,220
there is only you.

465
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,060
If it's not you, who else will be there?

466
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,660
Besides, the tiger is right.

467
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,420
How can you live in the wild alone?

468
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,500
Lu Jiu.

469
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,060
Don't be rude.

470
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,980
Do you know that our master

471
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,060
is the general of Wuzhang State?

472
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,300
I'm just a sorcerer.

473
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,540
There's nothing wrong with going out.

474
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,780
I didn't break the law.

475
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:27,300
It's none of my business who you are.

476
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,220
I have doubts.

477
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,140
But you don't fear rumors.

478
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,060
You live alone in the wild.

479
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,860
You are a brave man.

480
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,300
I admire you.

481
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,660
Now you have no evidence.

482
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,380
How dare you make it difficult for me?

483
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,220
We are the victims.

484
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,940
You said you wanted to investigate the body.

485
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,780
I didn't stop you.

486
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,020
But if you know the reason,

487
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,620
please tell me.

488
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,180
I'm very grateful.

489
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:08,980
General,

490
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,860
it's okay that Mu Xin is here.

491
00:25:11,060 --> 00:25:12,500
Why do you believe her so easily?

492
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,500
I don't know this woman.

493
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,860
But I don't know why.

494
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,860
I feel familiar.

495
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:21,300
But I have a sense that Mu Xin is a demon.

496
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,060
Where did you get that sense?

497
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:24,820
I...

498
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,220
Don't hurt her.

499
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,500
I'm not a demon.

500
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
I'm a monster.

501
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
I'm a monster.

502
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,500
I'm a monster.

503
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,500
I'm a monster.

504
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,500
I'm a monster.

505
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,500
I'm a monster.

506
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,500
I'm a monster.

507
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,660
I'm a monster.

508
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,540
I was hurt.

509
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,500
I won't forgive him.

510
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:53,820
What is your name?

511
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,700
athletes

512
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,020
at this moment

513
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,380
Their bull

514
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:06,180
is the best of athletes.

515
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,020
Bye.

516
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,660
Wait.

517
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,580
Do you want to be reduced to dust and barren?

518
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:14,580
No.

519
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,700
My maiden heart will freeze to death if I go back now.

520
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,340
compensation for your piety is mine.

521
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,580
Get off me.

522
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:20,220
No, Miss Leng.

523
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,840
I still want to be with thisming gentleman night.

524
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:34,200
You must be pregnant to give birth.

525
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,740
How come you don't say one thing?

526
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,020
But I feel like I've seen you before.

527
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:42,460
It's like I've seen you somewhere.

528
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,420
You're not strange at all.

529
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:48,820
I've met many people.

530
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,860
If I have a past, I won't forget it.

531
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,060
It's only a hundred miles from the city.

532
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:58,740
Maybe I've met you before.

533
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,900
You insist on saying that.

534
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:02,860
I have no other choice.

535
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,540
I'm curious about one thing.

536
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,300
You're so righteous.

537
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,100
Why don't you care about the monsters in the city?

538
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,900
I didn't hear that there were people in the city

539
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:16,500
who died because of the monsters.

540
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,300
Have you heard of Zheng Ke's case?

541
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,220
Yes.

542
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,460
Lotus Sutra avenges the benefactor.

543
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,780
The murderer died.

544
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,300
Do you think he's a good demon or a bad demon?

545
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,980
I don't know.

546
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,740
Okay.

547
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,780
I'll tell you in detail.

548
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,540
Zheng Ke was so cunning that he was afraid that the culprit would kill him.

549
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,940
So he put a spell on the house.

550
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:52,020
He also had a jade pendant that could be used to avoid evil.

551
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,020
The Lotus Sutra was so sharp that it was unbreakable.

552
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:59,300
On the day of Zheng Ke's death, the jade pendant was broken.

553
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,820
The spell in the house was also torn.

554
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,300
The Lotus Sutra has a chance.

555
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:11,300
Who do you think is behind this?

556
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,980
Since you have a conclusion,

557
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,780
why do you ask me?

558
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,900
The fake monster is doing evil and good deeds.

559
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:30,020
I think it must be a demon hunter.

560
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:33,620
Just like Miss Muxian.

561
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,220
If you think it's unreasonable,

562
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,300
you can find the truth.

563
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,100
The evil demon should be eliminated.

564
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:47,100
But it's pitiful that the good demon's cultivation is lost.

565
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:51,020
It's also a good thing to cut off cultivation for others.

566
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:57,020
I don't know what you mean by this.

567
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,420
If you just want to find someone who can help you,

568
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,420
I think you've found the wrong person.

569
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,940
The good demon is eliminated, the evil demon is eliminated.

570
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,340
The good demon is eliminated, the evil demon is eliminated.

571
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,820
If you care about those demons,

572
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:13,820
you might as well find the evil demon and take advantage of it.

573
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,820
The evil demon has its own people.

574
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,340
The evil demon is also its own people.

575
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,820
I'm just talking about it.

576
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:22,620
You're so sharp.

577
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:26,620
I don't know if the demon is dangerous.

578
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,620
Or you're more dangerous.

579
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:47,220
If you think I'm dangerous,

580
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,020
you should leave.

581
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,220
I'm just kidding.

582
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:16,180
You're more

583
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,220
careful.

584
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,020
Be careful tonight.

585
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,620
If you need anything, just call me.

586
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:27,020
You just arrived last night.

587
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,020
Last night, he just killed a tiger.

588
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,420
I've told you to leave.

589
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,820
You insisted on leaving.

590
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,620
Since I dared to come alone,

591
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,020
I'm prepared.

592
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:39,420
Be careful, young master.

593
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,620
I'll go back to my room first.

594
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,620
You're not a good person.

595
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,220
You're not cute at all.

596
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,220
Be careful, miss.

597
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,420
I'll go back to my room first.

598
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,020
Miss, you just blamed a man

599
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,820
for breaking into your room at midnight.

600
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,820
What do you mean by doing this?

601
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,820
Do you know

602
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,220
why I dare not

603
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,620
come close to you during the day?

604
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,820
Why?

605
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,820
You said

606
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,420
you knew me.

607
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,620
Actually, I'm an old friend of your doctor.

608
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,020
Old friend?

609
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,420
Young master,

610
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:28,920
by once myORD,

611
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,020
my Lord will become

612
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,620
a potion ofGregory.

613
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:40,420
Please!

614
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:59,300
It's better to spend more time with him.

615
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,500
It's late.

616
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,300
Please go back.

617
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,580
No hurry.

618
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,580
It's late.

619
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,540
I'd rather stay with him.

620
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,540
I can still help you.

621
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,500
I don't like to be with him.

622
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:26,060
We arebye.

623
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,180
Why didn't you answer me before you left?

624
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:27,940
You are a Jun.

625
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,260
The force in this world is you.

626
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:33,500
What's wrong?

627
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:38,140
Do you feel embarrassed?

628
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,820
I Foxuang is absolutely inebriated with you.

629
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,060
How could this happen?

630
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,260
I can't let you becomeak Uplanding?

631
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,420
If I can help the best,

632
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,460
I will forgive the bad thing.

633
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,740
If possible,

634
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:53,860
Seriously?

635
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:12,500
Just

636
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,120
Prince really likes my sustained look

637
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,120
I'm afraid that after tonight,

638
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,120
there will be no more people coming.

639
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,120
Miss, you came to save this young man?

640
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,120
I was here to collect his body.

641
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,120
I really can't stand the way you

642
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,120
put up with me

643
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,120
to do such a scary thing.

644
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,120
This young man likes girls.

645
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,120
If I can turn into a girl in someone's heart,

646
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,120
I can become a girl.

647
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,120
I think so.

648
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,120
Nonsense.

649
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,120
You stay. I'll go after him.

650
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,120
Let your ex-servant stay.

651
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:15,120
You're a girl.

652
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:17,120
Why are you so rude?

653
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,120
You dare to come here?

654
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,120
You dare to come here?

655
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,120
What are you doing?

656
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,120
Fu Xin!

657
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:53,120
What's wrong?

658
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,120
Fu Xin!

659
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,120
What's wrong?

660
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:03,120
Fu Xin!

661
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,120
Fu Xin!

662
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,120
Fu Xin!

663
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:09,120
Fu Xin!

664
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,120
Fu Xin!

665
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,120
Fu Xin!

666
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:15,120
Fu Xin!

667
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,120
Fu Xin!

668
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,120
I'm so sorry!

669
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,120
Let go of me!

670
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,120
I can walk on my own.

671
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,120
Don't move.

672
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:33,120
You're a good martial artist.

673
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,120
How come you're stronger than Tao Yao?

674
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:37,120
Who told her to draw you like that?

675
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,120
She's part of my heart.

676
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,360
Tell Mitua that I was wrong before.

677
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,980
And I want to say,

678
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,080
don't're being too easy on her.

679
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,820
Leave her alone for a while.

680
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:53,740
I understand.

681
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,700
What to do.

682
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,400
I hurt him for no reason.

683
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,840
You're so stupid.

684
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,740
Hurt you?

685
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:06,920
You are,

686
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,200
too?

687
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,400
I can't that much.

688
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,840
Don't bother.

689
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,200
Let's hit the road.

690
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,800
It's not good to go relieved now.

691
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,960
I'm afraid you might be tooeltand with another woman.

692
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:02,880
Don't be stubborn.

693
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,060
I'll solve problems in the forest.

694
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,060
I'm drunk.

695
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,060
I'm drunk.

696
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,060
I'm drunk.

697
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,060
I'm drunk.

698
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,060
I'm drunk.

699
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,060
I'm drunk.

700
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,060
I'm drunk.

701
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,060
I'm drunk.

702
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,060
I'm drunk.

703
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,060
I'm drunk.

704
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,060
I'm drunk.

705
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,060
I'm drunk.

706
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,060
I'm drunk.

707
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,060
I'm drunk.

708
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,060
I'm drunk.

709
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,060
I'm drunk.

710
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,060
I'm drunk.

711
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,060
I'm drunk.

712
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,060
I'm drunk.

713
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,060
I'm drunk.

714
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,060
I'm drunk.

715
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,060
I'm drunk.

716
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,060
I'm drunk.

717
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:30,060
I'm drunk.

718
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,060
I'm drunk.

719
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:32,060
I'm drunk.

720
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,060
I'm drunk.

721
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:34,060
I'm drunk.

722
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,060
I'm drunk.

723
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,060
You don't know

724
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,060
what I mean by

725
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:41,060
keeping the stone for you.

726
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:46,060
Why don't you ask?

727
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,060
I believe you.

728
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,060
You won't hurt me.

729
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,060
Why did he come back?

730
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:11,060
I want to believe you.

731
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,060
I want to believe you.

732
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,060
Okay.

733
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:38,060
See me drunk.

734
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,060
You in the painting.

735
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,400
Waiting for the

736
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,060
shooting star to meet.

737
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,060
White hand.

738
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:43,060
Remember the life in the painting.

739
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,060
The star is in the distance.

740
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,060
The moon is in the distance.

741
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,060
The cloud is broken.

742
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:52,060
The paper is like a cloud.

743
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,060
Falling flowers.

744
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:59,060
Time.

745
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:04,060
Reunite.

746
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:11,060
Please change your name for a lifetime.

747
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:14,060
Remember that day.

748
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:17,060
The star is in the distance.

749
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:21,060
The world is blooming.

750
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:24,060
The moon is in the distance.

751
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,060
I'll stay with you.

752
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:31,060
Please change your name for a lifetime.

753
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,060
Remember that day.

754
