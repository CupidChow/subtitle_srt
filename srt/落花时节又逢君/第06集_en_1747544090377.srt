00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:48,560
dites hai

00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,960
dur ר stage

3
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,800
huo ning

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,640
Ah!

5
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,400
Wow.

6
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,480
My Lord God is coming.

7
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,200
Do not move.

8
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:16,800
Sure.

9
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,680
Hey!

10
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,840
It'll get wet.

11
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,240
We just made a promise.

12
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,640
Are you in some danger?

13
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,400
I'm not.

14
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,360
I was chatting with Jun prec строmiyor

15
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,720
before but

16
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,820
he didn't want to talk to me.

17
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,100
I want something from you.

18
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,720
He asked for that directly.

19
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,200
Why did you under the table uhh me?

20
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,800
You like to bathe so much.

21
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,760
Do you know if...

22
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,960
Bathe?

23
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,920
You mean bathing?

24
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,520
When I was in Mount Baizhou,

25
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,800
I often bathed with a group of monsters.

26
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,880
It was so comfortable.

27
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,280
You often bathed with others in the mortal world?

28
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,920
I was a flower before.

29
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,240
They often took me to the spring water

30
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,680
and the rain to bathe.

31
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,360
I'll take you there next time.

32
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,720
The laws of the Heavens are the rules.

33
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,120
The flowers, the monsters and the red sands are forbidden.

34
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,920
You can only bathe at this time.

35
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,400
You can't be with others.

36
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,480
You can't pass the message to me when you're bathing.

37
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,760
If you do it again,

38
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,680
I'll confiscate your Junying Grass.

39
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,560
When was it fixed?

40
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,360
Just now.

41
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,640
So scary.

42
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,640
Wait.

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,880
What are you doing again?

44
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,920
I've made the flowers and the grass for you.

45
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,880
The flowers and the grass you made are going to be ready.

46
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,880
I can walk on my own.

47
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:04,880
Let's go.

48
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,200
Hongni, how dare you!

49
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,480
This...

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,640
This is too troublesome.

51
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,800
You'll talk about no poetry but in this room.

52
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:45,720
There are so many

53
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,840
such things.

54
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,080
Fly, sun, and even fairy- smokingrien have their own fates.

55
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,000
In the presence of jade, d stabilize like prison.

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,400
That's why the immortal will make a common rule.

57
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,960
Cultivation is a kind of restricting.

58
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,760
Restricting from the source of desire.

59
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,960
The immortal also needs to restricting.

60
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,720
To win and to lose, to fall is the key.

61
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,960
That's why he will be punished by heaven.

62
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,240
Why are you

63
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,480
so badly hurt?

64
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,640
You...

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,680
...will so badly hurt.

66
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,160
It must be painful.

67
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,200
No one's ever cried as I did.

68
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,520
But did you cry as others to learn

69
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,540
Man..

70
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,660
snake...?

71
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Or God?

72
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,480
Master,

73
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,760
your injury

74
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:38,580
is caused by the counter-effects of the cultivation of the Sea of

75
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,080
Transcendence.

76
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,080
These medicines are not only effective,

77
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,080
but also stimulate your wound,

78
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,080
especially this lily.

79
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,080
It's okay.

80
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,080
It's okay?

81
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,640
Hmm.

82
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,680
The

83
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,880
elixir of love

84
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,880
is short-term poison.

85
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:56,880
Ha.

86
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,880
Oh,

87
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
this,

88
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,880
no,

89
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,880
it's a good medicine.

90
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,880
It's a good medicine.

91
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
It could be a good medicine.

92
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,880
But it's strange.

93
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,880
Why is the wound of the counter-effects getting worse?

94
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,640
The

95
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,640
elixir of love

96
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,640
is short-term poison.

97
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,640
It's a good medicine.

98
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,640
Why is the wound of the counter-effects getting worse?

99
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,640
It's a good medicine.

100
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,640
Why is the wound of the counter-effects getting worse?

101
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,640
It's a good medicine.

102
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,640
Why is the wound of the counter-effects getting worse?

103
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,640
It's a good medicine.

104
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,640
Why is the wound of the counter-effects getting worse?

105
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:44,640
It's a good medicine.

106
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,640
Why is the wound of the counter-effects getting worse?

107
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,640
It's a good medicine.

108
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,200
Don't be afraid.

109
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,200
This is the elixir of love.

110
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Drink it.

111
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,200
Drink slowly.

112
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Drink slowly.

113
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,200
Drink slowly.

114
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
You've been sleepy for so long.

115
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,200
Don't drink too fast.

116
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:18,200
This is fresh soil.

117
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,760
I'll give it to you.

118
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,760
You are the red tea flower?

119
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
We are the same tea flower.

120
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,760
I am the red tea flower.

121
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,760
You are the red tea flower?

122
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,320
You are the red tea flower?

123
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,320
I...

124
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,320
I broke the heaven rule.

125
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,320
I was caught.

126
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,320
I didn't expect that there would be a demon

127
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,320
in this flower palace.

128
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
Then...

129
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Where did you come from?

130
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
Mount Baizhou.

131
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
I also came from Mount Baizhou.

132
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
There is a white tea festival at the top of the mountain next door.

133
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,320
You are the successful god.

134
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,320
It's me.

135
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,320
Then you are already the white tea flower fairy.

136
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,320
Why do they treat you like this?

137
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
I was successful in the capital.

138
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,320
I came to the Hua Zhao Palace to get the fairy chicken.

139
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:41,320
Thank you, fairy.

140
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Thank you, fairy.

141
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Thank you, fairy.

142
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Thank you, fairy.

143
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,320
Where did you come from?

144
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
Xiaoyao White Tea.

145
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,320
From Mount Baizhou.

146
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,320
Mount Baizhou?

147
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,320
The place where the demons gather?

148
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,320
Yes.

149
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
Wait for me.

150
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,880
Wait for you.

151
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,880
We are here.

152
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
Thank you, fairy.

153
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,880
I...

154
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
Thank you, fairy.

155
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
Thank you, fairy.

156
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
Thank you, fairy.

157
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,880
Fairy,

158
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,440
I'm in a hurry.

159
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,440
Fairy.

160
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,440
You are Ziteng?

161
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
Yes.

162
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,440
You made me wait for so long.

163
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,440
Xiaoyao, I'm sorry.

164
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,440
I was too late because I was in a hurry.

165
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Thank you, fairy.

166
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,440
From today on, you are Fairy Ziteng.

167
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,440
Come, follow me to Hua Zhao Palace.

168
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Fairy,

169
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,440
where is my fairy chicken?

170
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,440
Why haven't you left?

171
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,440
The fairy chicken has been released.

172
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,440
It's not yours.

173
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,440
You can go.

174
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,440
Why?

175
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,440
I'm just passing by the heaven.

176
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,440
I can get the fairy chicken.

177
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,440
Who said that?

178
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,440
The heaven.

179
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The heaven also said that the fairy chicken can't be turned down.

180
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Even if you get through the trial,

181
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
the heaven will decide who can be a fairy.

182
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You don't have a life.

183
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Go back.

184
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
I don't have a life?

185
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Then this Xiaoyao saved me.

186
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
The Xiaoyao you mentioned is Fairy Ziteng.

187
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
If you dare to lie again,

188
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
don't blame me for being rude to you.

189
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Go.

190
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,560
Go.

191
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,560
This fairy is too much.

192
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,560
How can she bully you like that?

193
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,560
I was unwilling to leave.

194
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,560
So I hid in this garden.

195
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,560
I haven't been able to get the chance to be with you.

196
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,560
I'm starting to feel sad.

197
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,560
I know you saved me.

198
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,560
Don't worry.

199
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,560
I'll be here.

200
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,560
I won't let them bully you.

201
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,560
They just bully me for being a demon.

202
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,560
I'm born to be a lowly person.

203
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:01,560
So I'm a fairy to get rid of this lowly demon.

204
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,560
I didn't expect that after I went to heaven,

205
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,560
I would still be like this.

206
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,560
Why are we lowly people?

207
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,560
You're not wrong.

208
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,560
They are wrong.

209
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,120
Demons and fairies are both skilled.

210
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,120
They just live in the sky and on the ground.

211
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,120
Why are they so good?

212
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,120
I thought you were like me.

213
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,120
You were a fan of the fairies.

214
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,120
That's why you stayed.

215
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,120
I did stay.

216
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,120
But I'm not a fan of the fairies.

217
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,120
I'm here to repay you.

218
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,120
For what?

219
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,120
You saved me before.

220
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,120
So I must repay you.

221
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,680
Don't worry.

222
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,680
God of Flower will uphold justice for you.

223
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,680
No.

224
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,680
I was buried in the sky

225
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,680
and violated the rules.

226
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,680
He won't forgive me.

227
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,680
What should we do?

228
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,680
You can't stay here forever.

229
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,680
Don't be afraid.

230
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,680
I can take you out of here

231
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:05,680
and go back to Mount Baizhou.

232
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,680
But I still want to be a fairy.

233
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,680
You also think it's wrong.

234
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,680
Right?

235
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,680
Since you've made your decision,

236
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,680
you should follow your heart.

237
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,680
I think

238
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,680
every flower

239
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,680
should bloom in the place he likes.

240
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,680
Although I don't know how to help you,

241
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,680
I'll be here

242
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,680
as long as you need me.

243
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,680
Since I was a kid,

244
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,680
no one has ever cared about me like you.

245
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,240
I didn't expect to meet you here.

246
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,240
Don't worry.

247
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,240
From now on,

248
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,240
we're friends.

249
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,240
From now on,

250
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,240
you're the best friend of Bai Cha

251
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,240
and the only friend.

252
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,240
Master.

253
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,240
Master.

254
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,240
What are you looking for?

255
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,240
I don't know.

256
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:22,240
I've been here for an hour.

257
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Master.

258
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,240
What are you looking for?

259
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,240
You're missing one jade basket.

260
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,240
I'm sorry.

261
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,240
The jade basket hasn't been returned yet.

262
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:45,240
I'm taking care of it now.

263
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,240
It's okay.

264
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,240
It's hard to take care of jade basket.

265
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,240
But it's hard to see it in the garden.

266
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,240
Master.

267
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,240
I won't bother you

268
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,240
with your identity.

269
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
It's okay.

270
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:59,240
You should do your duty.

271
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
No.

272
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:03,240
Let go.

273
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,240
I...

274
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,240
You're the flower god.

275
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
No.

276
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
Okay.

277
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,800
Let's go together.

278
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Okay.

279
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,800
Hongning.

280
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
Look who's here.

281
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,800
Shaoyao.

282
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,800
Shaoyao.

283
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
Shaoyao.

284
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,360
God.

285
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,360
Are you here to see me?

286
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,360
No.

287
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,360
We're here to send flowers.

288
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,360
I thought you were here to see me cultivate.

289
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,360
This basin?

290
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,360
Where's Shaoyao?

291
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,360
I'm here to send flowers too.

292
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,360
You two send a basin of flowers?

293
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,920
Is there a rule that

294
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,920
a basin of flowers can only be sent by one person?

295
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,920
No.

296
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,920
I'll put the flowers in first.

297
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,920
The flowers are blooming well.

298
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,920
Why did you send them to the garden?

299
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,920
It's a little strange to put them in the garden.

300
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,920
That's right.

301
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,920
The garden is so big.

302
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,920
They're so beautiful.

303
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,920
Wait.

304
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,920
My god.

305
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,920
What's wrong?

306
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,920
Take care.

307
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,320
White Tea Demon!

308
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,000
This has nothing to do with Hong Ning.

309
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,920
One person does what he should do.

310
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,280
I saved White Tea.

311
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:14,720
No.

312
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,960
I picked White Tea up in the garden.

313
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,680
I restored her spirit power.

314
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,880
White Tea Demon.

315
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,120
Hua Zha Gong guards the Three Realms.

316
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,800
How did you get in?

317
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,480
I...

318
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
I'm sorry.

319
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,280
Your Grace.

320
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,000
White Tea was born because it was successfully broken.

321
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:35,640
It's...

322
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,120
It's the Immortal Spirit that stole her spirit power.

323
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,400
You're lying!

324
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,040
Your Grace.

325
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,120
I promise you.

326
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,080
It's not true.

327
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,520
I've never seen her.

328
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,280
Your Grace.

329
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,520
Hong Ning is right.

330
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:56,200
I was a devotee of Bai Zhou Mountain.

331
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,320
I wanted to change my destiny

332
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,680
and become a human.

333
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,240
But I couldn't help it.

334
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:23,120
I broke the rule of the heaven and succeeded in the

335
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,280
Heaven Realm.

336
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,560
Your Grace.

337
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:32,840
Immortal Spirit.

338
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,640
What else do you want to say?

339
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:37,640
White Tea Demon is from Bai Zhou Mountain.

340
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,240
There are many demons there.

341
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,480
They are evil and evil.

342
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,440
Now they are hiding in the garden.

343
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,600
I don't know what they are up to.

344
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,560
I'm doing this for the sake of the Heaven Realm.

345
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,640
It's just a matter of time.

346
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,920
You are not upright.

347
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,720
You dare to break the law of the heaven.

348
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,200
You are using the Immortal Spirit.

349
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,960
You are so arrogant and domineering.

350
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,320
You must not be tolerated.

351
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,680
You should leave now.

352
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,720
You can avoid the Immortal Spirit's decree

353
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,040
and be a lower immortal.

354
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,840
You should guard the Hundred Flower Forest

355
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,240
and keep yourself safe.

356
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,840
Your Grace, please spare me.

357
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:14,840
The fact that White Tea Demon is hiding in the Flower Palace

358
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,080
is the support of the Flower Palace.

359
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,080
From today on,

360
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,760
everyone should spread the rumor.

361
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,280
If anyone does anything wrong,

362
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,800
he will be punished severely.

363
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:25,800
Yes.

364
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,400
Immortal Mei,

365
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,560
take Kunlun and Hong Ning back separately.

366
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,560
Keep a close watch on them.

367
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,840
Don't let them leave.

368
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:38,920
Yes.

369
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,800
Immortal Xing Yi.

370
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,240
Immortal Mei.

371
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,240
Immortal Mei, you called me wrong.

372
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,560
I am just a lower immortal now.

373
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,920
The Immortal is angry now.

374
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,240
That's why he treats you like this.

375
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,200
You must think carefully about it.

376
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,040
Don't cause any trouble again.

377
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,720
Are you here to laugh at me?

378
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,040
I am not like you.

379
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,000
I am noble and I don't need to do anything

380
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,800
to gain respect and status.

381
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,640
What did you say?

382
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,080
I was born a demon and I trained myself to be an immortal.

383
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,040
In the Flower Palace,

384
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,280
everyone calls me an immortal.

385
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,880
But who is not

386
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,280
following my footsteps?

387
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,040
What are you thinking about?

388
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,240
Immortal Mei,

389
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,080
you have lived in the Flower Palace since you were a child.

390
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,320
How do you know

391
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,920
how a little immortal like us

392
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,440
who climbed up from the mortal world,

393
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,520
has never been a demon?

394
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,360
I have been a mere immortal

395
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,320
since I was born.

396
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,640
This is what the God told me.

397
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,120
But now, he is the one who keeps breaking the law.

398
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:53,560
Not me.

399
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,440
You are too stubborn.

400
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,240
Yes.

401
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,680
I am stubborn and I don't know how to change.

402
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,160
I only know that I am an immortal, a demon, and a demon.

403
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,760
It is my duty to punish them.

404
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,640
But now, the God

405
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,240
has brought the red tea demon to the Celestial Palace

406
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,600
and let the white tea demon bloom in the Celestial Palace.

407
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,240
This matter

408
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,160
can't go on like this.

409
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,240
You areue

410
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,000
my coordinates and details now,

411
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,200
and I want to know

412
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,040
what you have as a Present to me.

413
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,360
Xiao Bai.

414
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,520
Xiao Bai. Xiao Bai.

415
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:47,160
Hou Ning.

416
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,080
How dare you?

417
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,080
I can't delay the punishment.

418
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,080
The tea wasn't written on the list of the flower fairy pond.

419
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,080
It was ordered by the God.

420
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:01,080
It can't be known by the imperial doctor.

421
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,080
Otherwise, the tea will only be wasted.

422
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,080
Why is there that old man everywhere?

423
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,080
Then I ask you.

424
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:15,080
Do you think it's more troublesome to delay the punishment?

425
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,080
Or to offend me?

426
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,080
I think it's more troublesome to offend me.

427
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,080
This...

428
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,080
Xiao Bai.

429
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,080
I'm sorry.

430
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,080
I didn't protect you well.

431
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,080
What sorry?

432
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,080
I got you involved.

433
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,080
If it weren't for you,

434
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,080
I would have died in this flower garden.

435
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:41,080
But you haven't become a fairy.

436
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,080
They are so unfair to you.

437
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,080
The tea of the immortal demon can't be defied.

438
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,080
Maybe this is my fate.

439
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,080
Hong Ning.

440
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,080
Thank you for saving me.

441
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,080
You are good to me.

442
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,080
I will remember it for a lifetime.

443
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,080
What will you do in the future?

444
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,080
What will happen if he pushes into the flower fairy pond?

445
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:06,080
This flower fairy pond is the place where the God who committed the wrong thing is punished.

446
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,080
If he goes there, he will be punished by the phoenix fairy and the flower fairy garden.

447
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,080
But he hasn't become a fairy.

448
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,080
So...

449
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,080
So he will only be defiled as a white tea demon

450
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,080
and will have no fairyland.

451
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,080
Hong Ning.

452
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,080
Believe my brother's decision.

453
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,080
Hong Ning.

454
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,080
Now I am blessed to have a demon body because of you.

455
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,080
I am not so disappointed with the fairyland.

456
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,080
Your fairyland is so deep.

457
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,080
And it's the demon that Lord Huashan brought to the heaven himself.

458
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,080
You must cultivate yourself

459
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,080
and become the first immortal in our Baizhou Mountain.

460
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,080
When you become an immortal,

461
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,080
I will have friends who are immortal.

462
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:52,080
Xiaobai.

463
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,080
Lord Kunlun.

464
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,080
It's getting late.

465
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,080
It's too late.

466
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
Take him away.

467
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,080
Hong Ning.

468
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,080
Hong Ning.

469
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,080
I will pray for you no matter what.

470
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,080
Xiaobai.

471
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,080
You must take care of yourself.

472
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,080
Your Majesty.

473
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,080
Greetings, Imperial Physician.

474
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,080
The punishment has been completed.

475
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,080
Only seven immortal have been removed from the immortal garden.

476
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,080
And twelve evil demons have been sent to the Qilin Cave.

477
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,080
They are waiting for you to execute them.

478
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:29,080
Send the seven immortal to the main road.

479
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,080
Yes.

480
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,080
Only these seven?

481
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,080
Yes.

482
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,080
How dare you!

483
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:48,080
How dare you deceive the magic and hide the evil demon!

484
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,080
I'm wronged, Imperial Physician.

485
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,080
I dare not.

486
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,080
Guards.

487
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,080
Send him to the Flower Fairy Pool.

488
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,080
Please spare my life, Imperial Physician.

489
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,080
I'm just following orders.

490
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,080
Please spare my life.

491
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,080
Please spare my life, Imperial Physician.

492
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,080
The fairy is right.

493
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,080
This red and white tea

494
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,080
is really extraordinary.

495
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,080
Engraved.

496
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,080
protected.

497
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,080
Your Excellency.

498
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:35,080
The white tea has been sent away?

499
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,080
Yes.

500
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,080
Did Hongning follow her too?

501
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,080
Sure.

502
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,140
Don't worry.

503
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,460
He is back in the Suihe Garden.

504
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,380
I have requires someone

505
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,360
not to let him

506
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,980
sneak out again.

507
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,540
But...

508
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,320
But Mermaids

509
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,580
really can't stop him.

510
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,100
So can he.

511
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,660
Your master.

512
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,480
What is it?

513
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,380
Hong Ning and the Mermaids

514
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,200
have been taken by Zhong Tian's soldiers.

515
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,960
He's gone.

516
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,960
You still dare to argue?

517
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,240
The Immortal Realm and the Eastern Sea

518
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:21,720
are dissatisfied with you

519
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,760
because you

520
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,640
are a Bai Cha Demon.

521
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,800
The demons are not in the Heaven Realm.

522
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,960
You can't defy them.

523
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,640
Who gave you the courage to do this?

524
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,080
I've saved him.

525
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,920
He's been dragged into the Immortal Pool.

526
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,120
Those old immortals

527
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,400
are not used to seeing me today.

528
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,120
You just want to take the opportunity to punish me.

529
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,480
What else do you want now?

530
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,520
You've really grown up.

531
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,360
Since you came out of the White Flower Map,

532
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,160
I thought you had changed your mind.

533
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,920
You've made such a big mistake

534
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,360
after so long.

535
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,000
You're lawless.

536
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,880
I thought no one could do anything to you.

537
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,840
Of course not.

538
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,000
Since I was born,

539
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,800
you've been punished for two days

540
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,640
and punished for three days.

541
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,000
You must think

542
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,680
I'm a useless son.

543
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,720
Why don't you send me to the Immortal Pool

544
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,400
and make up with me?

545
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,920
Or you can push me into the Qi Lin Cave

546
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:16,760
and get a piece of my heart.

547
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,720
Shut up.

548
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,120
Greetings, Father.

549
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,040
Mother.

550
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,440
Jin Xiu, you're just in time.

551
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,000
Nie Zi is now

552
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,840
trying to get along with the demon.

553
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,080
You've made the whole thing worse.

554
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,360
You're in charge of Hua Zhao Palace.

555
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,840
Tell me what's going on.

556
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,200
Then punish me severely.

557
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,400
Don't be ungrateful.

558
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,720
Mother, don't worry.

559
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,920
I'll punish Kunlun severely.

560
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,720
But the fact that Hua Zhao Palace is hiding the demon

561
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,560
has nothing to do with Kunlun.

562
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,800
It's my responsibility.

563
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,560
What's going on?

564
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:04,880
Father,

565
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,040
White Tea was supposed to be a fairy,

566
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,280
but it was stopped

567
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,920
because it was not able to receive the Immortal Qi on time.

568
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,800
Now it's been cleared off the street.

569
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,760
Since it's been removed,

570
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,400
let's just put an end to it.

571
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,120
Although White Tea Demon is in the heaven,

572
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,640
the rules are the rules.

573
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,520
The White Tea Clan

574
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,520
must not be opened for a hundred years.

575
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,200
Your Majesty,

576
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,760
Hua Zhao Palace

577
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,480
is not just a demon.

578
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:39,480
What?

579
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,760
There are other demons?

580
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,640
Bring them up.

581
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,440
Shanghai

582
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,200
Greetings. Your Majesty.

583
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,800
Your Majesty, White Tea Beastie...

584
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,400
How dare you!

585
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,680
Never talk ill about the king!

586
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,080
Jinxiu,

587
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,040
Did you bring the red tea demon

588
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,120
to the heaven yourself?

589
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,120
Yes.

590
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,680
The heaven doesn't allow demons to be evil.

591
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,680
As a punishment,

592
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,680
you dare to punish and break the law.

593
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,880
I know my mistake.

594
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,040
I was too self-righteous.

595
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,000
But this matter

596
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,720
has nothing to do with the red tea.

597
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:50,720
I hope Your Majesty...

598
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,240
Enough!

599
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,640
Stop making excuses.

600
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,680
I will punish you if you break the rules.

601
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,880
But I never expected

602
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,240
you to be so ridiculous.

603
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,160
It seems that

604
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,800
Kunlun is in a bad situation

605
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,280
because of your brother, Yan Chuan.

606
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:10,720
Tell me.

607
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,760
What is the relationship between him and the red tea flower?

608
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,760
You made a fool of yourself with the red tea flower.

609
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,720
Is it because of your love?

610
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,280
Father.

611
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,440
The red tea was made a mistake in the lower realm.

612
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,640
I brought it back to the Hua Zhao Palace

613
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,800
just to warn you.

614
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,040
I didn't mean to do that.

615
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,800
I didn't want him to make a mistake

616
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,280
in the Hua Zhao Palace.

617
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,400
I was too self-righteous.

618
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,320
As a judge,

619
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,800
I have the responsibility to uphold the law.

620
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,280
I will punish him immediately

621
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,720
and let him go.

622

优优独播剧场——YoYo Television Series Exclusive

623
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:26,920
Jinxiu.

624
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:32,540
Follow the rules and follow your own 81-dash Tian Xing.

625
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,940
Yes.

626
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,040
You are the God of the Gods.

627
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,040
You are the leader of all gods and also a god of the rules.

628
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,740
You can't make any mistakes in this position.

629
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,240
You must understand this.

630
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,240
Jin Xiu, don't panic.

631
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:02,640
God of the Gods

632
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,040
The real doctor really doesn't know

633
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,340
that your injury is so serious?

634
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:22,040
You are so serious.

635
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,240
It's okay.

636
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,740
My Lord,

637
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:33,540
Hong Cha should be leaving now.

638
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,540
Officer Ju,

639
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,540
leave.

640
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,440
I'll take my leave.

641
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:03,140
Hong Cha

642
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:15,240
Hong Niang!

643
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,040
Shaoyao,

644
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,340
give me more time.

645
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:23,040
As soon as possible.

646
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,440
Hong Niang,

647
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,640
if you are bullied in the mortal world,

648
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,040
they will help you find any Shaoyao flower.

649
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,440
Thank you, Shaoyao.

650
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,240
Here.

651
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,040
This is the honey and wine from the Furen flower.

652
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,240
This is the kui flower from the Rosy Garden.

653
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,440
These are the farewell letters from the Guzi flower.

654
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,840
They were all taken to the Hundred Flower Forest.

655
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,040
I really can't leave.

656
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,840
I can't accept this.

657
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,440
I can't accept this. This is too expensive.

658
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,340
You all worked so hard to make this. I can't accept it.

659
00:35:58,340 --> 00:35:59,840
You must accept it.

660
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:03,040
If you don't give it to them, they will blame me.

661
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,040
Okay.

662
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,240
Okay. Thank you, Shaoyao.

663
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:12,640
Hong Niang, you helped me so much.

664
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,840
I can't help you with anything.

665
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,440
I'm sorry.

666
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,440
How could you?

667
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,940
I came here to meet you and be your friend.

668
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,740
This is the best thing.

669
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,540
Really?

670
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:27,140
If there's a chance, I'll do something bad.

671
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:28,940
I'll go with you.

672
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:32,540
You can't do bad things. You must rest.

673
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,740
You must think that one day,

674
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:37,540
we can reunite at the Flower Palace.

675
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:41,540
Yes. I'll stay here

676
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:43,540
and wait for you to come back.

677
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,340
It's time.

678
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:49,540
I'm leaving. Be good.

679
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,740
Okay.

680
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,740
Take care.

681
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:00,940
You must be fine.

682
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:12,140
You go back first. I'll be here.

683
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,740
Yes.

684
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,740
Let's go.

685
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,340
Don't be so stubborn.

686
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:28,540
Although you still have the Thunder Formation,

687
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,940
don't worry.

688
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,140
After you leave the world,

689
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:33,540
I'll be here every day

690
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,540
to see you.

691
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,940
I'll be watching you.

692
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,740
Immortal Xu,

693
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,940
can I see Shen Zun again

694
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:42,940
before I leave?

695
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,940
I beg you.

696
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,940
I beg you.

697
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,940
I beg you.

698
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,340
I beg you.

699
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,140
Can you be more obedient?

700
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,940
Do you know how much trouble

701
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,740
you caused to Shen Zun?

702
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,740
But I can't just

703
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:01,340
let Bai Cha die.

704
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:05,940
You little demon.

705
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,540
Why do you always

706
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,940
get along with the big rules

707
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,740
in the hearts of the immortals?

708
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,140
Do you know?

709
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:15,540
All the immortals in this world

710
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,340
are the ones who follow the divine rules.

711
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:20,740
You're a demon who hates the world.

712
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:24,340
Why do you have to go against the heaven?

713
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,940
Listen to me.

714
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:32,740
Don't tell Shen Zun about this.

715
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:35,140
He did this for your own good.

716
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:37,940
If he didn't do this,

717
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,340
you...

718
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:41,740
you might have been sent to the Qilin Cave.

719
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,940
You might have been destroyed.

720
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:45,340
I know.

721
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,340
I just want to see him again.

722
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,340
If I don't see him this time,

723
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,140
I'll see him again next time.

724
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,140
That will be a long, long, long time later.

725
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,740
What do you know?

726
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,140
I don't think you know.

727
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:56,940
Know, know, know.

728
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,940
What do you know?

729
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,940
You know.

730
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,540
Shen Zun is a star of the heaven and earth.

731
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,540
If he's in trouble,

732
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,940
he'll come back and be loyal to heaven.

733
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,740
You?

734
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,540
Even if you can go to heaven again,

735
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:10,740
you'll see other immortals.

736
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,540
What are you doing?

737
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,340
You're dreaming of summoning him, right?

738
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:16,340
That's a high-level magic.

739
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,740
Unless Shen Zun himself did it,

740
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:19,940
the heaven and earth

741
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,340
can't summon him anytime.

742
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,340
Do you understand?

743
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:24,540
Listen to me.

744
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,940
Shen Zun.

745
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,140
Yes, yes, yes.

746
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,340
Shen Zun.

747
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,740
Shen Zun.

748
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:40,540
Yes, yes, yes.

749
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,340
I'm sorry, Shen Zun.

750
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,740
Why waste a chance?

751
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,540
Shen Zun.

752
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,740
My stove is still on fire.

753
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:59,340
Why don't you send him to the southern gate for me?

754
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,140
No.

755
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,140
This jade grass

756
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,740
is for you to use when you're in trouble.

757
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:21,940
I can hear it from the sky and the earth.

758
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:25,340
Next time, don't use it so carelessly.

759
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,940
Shen Zun.

760
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:32,340
Why do you look so pale?

761
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,740
Are you going to be punished again?

762
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,540
It's okay.

763
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,940
I'm sorry.

764
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,540
I didn't know the consequences were so severe.

765
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,140
I was wrong.

766
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,340
You didn't do anything wrong.

767
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,340
The heaven and earth didn't do anything wrong either.

768
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,940
You wanted justice for Bai Chao.

769
00:40:49,940 --> 00:40:52,940
But the heaven and earth are guarded by the order of the world's new demon.

770
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,740
It can't be destroyed.

771
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,340
If I leave,

772
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,740
will you not be able to bear to part with me?

773
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:07,140
Leaving you is for your own good.

774
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,540
But I won't be able to bear to part with you.

775
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:19,140
Hong Ni, if I say

776
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,540
to let you rest in the mortal realm for a few more days,

777
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:23,540
you can get the chance to go down the line.

778
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,140
Are you willing to?

779
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:29,140
Then I can go down the line and see you again.

780
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:33,540
But you can stay in Hua Zhao Palace.

781
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:35,140
Really?

782
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:37,740
Then I will.

783
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,540
No matter how hard it is, as long as I can see you again,

784
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:44,340
as long as I can stay in Hua Zhao Palace, I'm not afraid of anything.

785
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:55,140
Master Shen Zun, I'm leaving.

786
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:58,340
Can you hug me?

787
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,940
Rest well.

788
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,740
Then let's part ways here.

789
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,340
Wait.

790
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,940
You're practicing in the mortal realm.

791
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,140
It's not convenient for me to appear every day.

792
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:33,140
This red tea spiritual hairpin can turn into a sword.

793
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:35,740
This red tea spiritual hairpin can turn into a sword.

794
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:38,740
It can be useful in difficult times.

795
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:43,540
Master Shen Zun, why are you so good to me?

796
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:48,340
It's time. Go to the mortal realm.

797
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:57,940
Master Shen Zun, you must wait for me!

798
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:06,060
The

799
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:23,340
Monkey King, you must become a deity.

800
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,540
Hurry up! What are you thinking about?

801
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,940
Okay.

802
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,940
Hurry up. Look! Who is that?

803
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:39,340
Isn't that... that... White Tea Immortal?

804
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:41,340
No way. He went home to visit his family.

805
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,340
It's him.

806
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,740
It's him.

807
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,740
White Tea Immortal.

808
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:51,340
The nobility is different.

809
00:43:51,340 --> 00:43:54,340
White Tea Immortal, where are you going?

810
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,140
Play cards. Come.

811
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,340
Your Highness, the disciple of Xing Yun Pavilion said that

812
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,340
the Star of Heaven and Earth is still being misled by the unknown clouds.

813
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,540
There are no other changes.

814
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,940
Okay. You may leave.

815
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,940
I will take my leave.

816
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,540
Come out.

817
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,340
Greetings, Your Highness.

818
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,140
How is the Immortal?

819
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:24,740
Replying to Your Highness, the Immortal is being punished in the Flowerless Forest every day.

820
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:27,140
Master Shen Zun indeed is angry this time.

821
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:31,140
I'm afraid that the Immortal will not be able to greet you in time.

822
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,940
The Immortal is a very cunning person.

823
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,540
I knew that he would be in trouble sooner or later.

824
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:38,540
The Immortal is indeed a bit more cunning.

825
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,340
I will add a reminder.

826
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:43,940
These days, I will do my best to serve you.

827
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,340
You are a smart person.

828
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:49,340
How is Kunlun Jun?

829
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,140
Kunlun Jun has a very powerful power.

830
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,540
When he returned to the Flowerless Forest, he disappeared.

831
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,940
I really can't find him.

832
00:44:55,940 --> 00:44:57,940
Forget it.

833
00:44:57,940 --> 00:44:59,940
If he has any thoughts,

834
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:02,740
he will surely make everyone know.

835
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:06,740
You should put more thoughts on Jinxiu.

836
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:09,540
The Heavenly Empress is very concerned about the two hearts of Heaven and Earth.

837
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,340
I will report to her in time.

838
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:15,140
Enough. You may leave.

839
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:16,740
Yes.

840
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:24,340
Very concerned about the hearts of Heaven and Earth.

841
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:29,940
If it's not about the two hearts of Heaven and Earth,

842
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:32,740
how can I be at ease?

843
00:45:55,940 --> 00:46:02,340
The long journey has long gone with the wind.

844
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:08,540
When will we meet again?

845
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:13,940
Our hands are tied together.

846
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:18,340
I only wish to spend the rest of my life with you.

847
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:21,940
I only wish to be with you.

848
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:27,940
The cloud has already stopped, only the clouds are left.

849
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:40,940
The world has fallen, we meet again.

850
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:46,940
I only wish to spend the rest of my life with you.

851
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:52,940
I still remember the day when I was happy.

852
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:59,940
When the flowers bloomed, I still remember the time when we were far apart.

853
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:06,940
I will accompany you to the end of the world to watch the wind and rain.

854
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:12,940
I only wish to spend the rest of my life with you.

855
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:18,940
I still remember the day when I was happy.

856
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:25,940
When the flowers bloomed, I still remember the time when we were far apart.

857
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:31,940
I will accompany you to the end of the world to watch the wind and rain.

858
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:38,940
I only wish to spend the rest of my life with you.

859
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:44,940
I only wish to spend the rest of my life with you.

860
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:51,940
Even if time is merciless, I will not forget our past.

861
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:58,940
I will spend the rest of my life with you.
