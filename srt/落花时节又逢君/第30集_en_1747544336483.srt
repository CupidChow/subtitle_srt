1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:47,240
My mind is still Guardian

2
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:58,440
I didn'tные even care wherest youping

3
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:47,740
Death courses

4
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,740
Episode 16

5
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,740
Hong Ning, you're back!

6
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,740
You've been out for so many years.

7
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,740
You must have suffered a lot.

8
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,740
You've lost weight. You...

9
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,740
I'm Mu Xian, not Hong Ning.

10
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:16,740
You're not Hong Ning?

11
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:21,740
I'm the main teacher of Qingyue State, Mu Xian.

12
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:24,740
Fine.

13
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,740
Let's go.

14
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,740
How could it be?

15
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:35,740
Xingguan, did something happen to Zhong Tian?

16
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,740
I don't know.

17
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,740
How could you not know?

18
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,740
Don't say it's me.

19
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,740
No one in Zhong Tian knows.

20
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,660
The Heaven and Earth Stars are in a state of

21
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,740
8-level skin, even if they don't die.

22
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:51,740
And the Heaven and Earth Lord

23
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,740
never wakes up after returning to his position.

24
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,740
I think he hurt his body

25
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,740
and his vitality when he was in a state of

26
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,740
9-level skin.

27
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,740
He hurt his body? Is it that serious?

28
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,740
No, don't think about it.

29
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,740
Look, do you remember that place?

30
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,740
Although it's been thousands of years,

31
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,740
I can still remember it.

32
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,740
I was sitting there at that time.

33
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:16,740
I was sitting there and taking you to class.

34
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,740
These flowers are...

35
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,740
The immortals also know that the God is missing.

36
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,740
They pray for him.

37
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,740
It's a kind of flower festival.

38
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,740
But the flowers in the Flower Forest are so mysterious.

39
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,740
The flower god hasn't returned, and the flowers are not in place.

40
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:44,740
Of course, there is no new flower.

41
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,740
I don't think so.

42
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,740
There is no sign of a sign on the Life and Death Road.

43
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:55,740
The ancient book of Xingyun Pavilion has changed again.

44
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,740
In the Heaven and Earth,

45
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,740
everywhere has been searched, but no trace of the God has been found.

46
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,740
I'm just worried that the God is not so good.

47
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,740
Oh.

48
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:12,740
You said that he hasn't returned.

49
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,740
Is it because I hurt his God root?

50
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:18,740
Don't think like that.

51
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:23,740
The affairs of the God are over.

52
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,740
If you don't do those things,

53
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,740
how can you save the people of Wuzhang?

54
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,740
How can you have merit?

55
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:33,740
And you can't light up the Star of Heaven and Earth.

56
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:36,740
The Star of Heaven and Earth hasn't been extinguished.

57
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:42,740
Maybe it's the God and Wei Du's misfortune.

58
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,740
Don't cry.

59
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,740
Let's go.

60
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,740
Magistrate Ju.

61
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,740
Magistrate Ziteng.

62
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,740
Magistrate Ziteng is currently in charge of the affairs of HuaZhao Palace.

63
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,740
This is Magistrate MuXian who just became the Magistrate of the Flower Garden.

64
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,740
That's right.

65
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:06,740
There was a little red tea monster in the palace.

66
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,740
He looks a bit like you.

67
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,740
Really?

68
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,740
That's too coincidental.

69
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:17,740
But this red tea is rough, rough and playful.

70
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,740
He doesn't know the rules.

71
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,740
I think Magistrate MuXian is not that kind of person.

72
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,740
Magistrate Ziteng is too worried.

73
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:29,740
Since I hurt the God, I will follow the rules.

74
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,740
It's good that you know the rules.

75
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,740
Alright, let's go.

76
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,740
Let's go.

77
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,740
Ignore him.

78
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,740
He looks similar, but he is very soft.

79
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,740
Magistrate Ziteng is really too much.

80
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,740
Just follow the rules.

81
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,740
Why bother with him?

82
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,740
HuaZhao Palace is no longer the head of the family.

83
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,740
It has become like this.

84
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,740
Look, it's not as good as before.

85
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,740
Are you Magistrate MuXian?

86
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,740
I am.

87
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,740
Magistrate Ziteng just told me that these flowers need to be planted before the flower gathering.

88
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,740
Thank you.

89
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:28,740
Wait, so many flowers?

90
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,740
You should know that Magistrate MuXian just got the divine power.

91
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,740
His power is weak.

92
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,740
To take care of so many flowers, he needs a lot of spiritual power.

93
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,740
How can he cultivate himself with so much spiritual power?

94
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,740
How can he cultivate himself?

95
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:45,740
Magistrate Ziteng said that the things in the garden are already old.

96
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,740
If Magistrate MuXian can't finish it, he can ask the Goddess for permission.

97
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:52,740
There are other powers in the heaven.

98
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:54,740
Fine.

99
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:57,740
I will go to Magistrate Ziteng and talk to him.

100
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,740
I will see if I can repair these flowers before the flower gathering.

101
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,740
Magistrate Ziteng has given me hope.

102
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,740
I will do my best to let these flowers bloom again.

103
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,740
Thank you, Magistrate.

104
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,740
I'm going to the garden.

105
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,740
Isn't it because the Magistrate is not here?

106
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,740
They are busy with Magistrate Ziteng and the Goddess.

107
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,740
They came to our HuaZhao Palace to do nothing.

108
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:32,740
I just went to the heaven.

109
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,740
I should do more things.

110
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,740
He doesn't ask you to do more things.

111
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,740
He...

112
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,740
He is just bullying you.

113
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:43,740
If the Magistrate is here, how can he make you angry?

114
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,740
I will go to the garden.

115
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,740
I will go to the garden.

116
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,740
I will go to the garden.

117
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,740
I will go to the garden.

118
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,740
I will go to the garden.

119
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,740
I will go to the garden.

120
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,740
I will go to the garden.

121
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,740
I will go to the garden.

122
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,740
I will go to the garden.

123
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,740
I will go to the garden.

124
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,740
I will go to the garden.

125
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,740
I will go to the garden.

126
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:11,740
I will go to the garden.

127
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,740
I will go to the garden.

128
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,740
It is time, Brother.

129
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:19,740
I just came back from the temple.

130
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,740
The mist runs through my hair and hairs.

131
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,740
I said, the spiky 오 indeed.

132
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:25,740
It is something, I do not know.

133
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,740
I know the OL T blooming of the Licorice.

134
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,740
What is it?

135
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,740
That is enough, what is it?

136
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:33,740
Hum?

137
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,740
I don't understand.

138
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,740
What is diubing the conch of Goddess,

139
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,740
wearing such a loud voice?

140
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,740
If you have any doubts,

141
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,740
I have something to tell you.

142
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,740
When did you become so stubborn?

143
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,740
After experiencing the incident of Wuzhang,

144
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,740
and the moment of life and death,

145
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,740
I finally understand what I want.

146
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,740
I was a pervert before.

147
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,740
I clearly liked and cared about you,

148
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,740
but I didn't dare to face and admit it.

149
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,740
Listen to me first.

150
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,740
I'm not afraid of you.

151
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,740
I'm not afraid of you.

152
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,740
I'm not afraid of you.

153
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,740
I'm done.

154
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,740
Lu Yao.

155
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,740
When you were going to marry my brother,

156
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,740
I always deliberately teased you

157
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,740
and made you angry.

158
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,740
But afterwards, I was also very angry.

159
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:25,740
I even thought that

160
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,740
I was sick.

161
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,740
I don't know why I did that.

162
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,740
Until later, I realized

163
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,740
that it was because I was unwilling.

164
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,740
I wanted you to see me

165
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,740
and feel me.

166
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,740
I didn't want to see anyone else.

167
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,740
But I didn't know what to do.

168
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,740
I could only use this stupid method

169
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,740
to get a little bit of your attention.

170
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,740
I'm not afraid.

171
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,740
After experiencing this incident,

172
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:59,740
I finally saw the truth.

173
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,740
I like you.

174
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,740
I love you.

175
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,740
I want to be with you.

176
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,740
When the flowers bloom,

177
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,740
the flowers fall.

178
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,740
When the time

179
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,740
comes,

180
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,740
the love will be broken.

181
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,740
The world is full of twists and turns.

182
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,740
Who will come to meet me?

183
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,740
Who will fall into the dust

184
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,740
and become a moon?

185
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,740
I don't care about the past,

186
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,740
I don't care about the past,

187
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,740
even if I'm in this life,

188
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:43,740
I don't regret it.

189
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,740
The wind is blowing in my mind,

190
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,740
I'm lost in my heart.

191
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,740
I don't want to see the flowers bloom.

192
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,740
Kunlun Jun,

193
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,740
now you're back to Zhong Tian.

194
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,740
You're back to Zhong Tian.

195
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,740
You're back to Zhong Tian.

196
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,740
No matter how I change,

197
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,740
I'm either the Bai Ling of the ice,

198
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,740
the son of the Prime Minister,

199
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,740
or the Kunlun Jun of the past.

200
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,740
I've never changed my love for you.

201
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,740
Do you know what kind of person I am?

202
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,740
The North Fairy Realm is very powerful.

203
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,740
So I need to marry your brother

204
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,740
to rebuild the North Fairy Realm.

205
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,740
You don't remember the past.

206
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:31,740
I just think you're a bad guy.

207
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,740
But you're forced to follow the Heavenly Lake.

208
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,740
I have to stay with you.

209
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,740
I wanted to use you

210
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,740
as my beloved son

211
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,740
to get the help of West Sea.

212
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,740
That's why I approached you

213
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,740
and helped you.

214
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,740
This is me.

215
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,740
You're so close to me.

216
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,740
I'm so desperate.

217
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:01,740
So?

218
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,740
You're so annoying and use me.

219
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,740
Have you ever loved me

220
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,740
at all?

221
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,740
So what if I have?

222
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,740
So what if I don't?

223
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,740
Now I've got what I want.

224
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,740
These useless love affairs

225
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,740
are just half-truths to me.

226
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,740
Okay.

227
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,740
I'm being too kind.

228
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,740
I'll leave now.

229
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,740
Goodbye.

230
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,740
I shouldn't use you anymore.

231
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,740
Goodbye.

232
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,740
Please rise.

233
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,420
Lu Yao failed to light up Kunlun's

234
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,740
sky and earth.

235
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,740
Father asked me to do it.

236
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,740
I came to apologize.

237
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,740
Alright.

238
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,740
Since Jinxiu hasn't appeared yet,

239
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,740
we still have hope for Kunlun.

240
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,740
Did Zhong Tianwang really disappear?

241
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,740
What's wrong?

242
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,320
The whole Zhong Tian has been searched

243
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,040
There is no clue

244
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,380
Heavenly daughter

245
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,260
You were sacrificed by Kunlun Jun in Wuzhang Kingdom

246
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,160
I see it all

247
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:48,400
Now, the doctor still needs your help

248
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,840
Don't worry

249
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,680
The conditions we agreed on will not change

250
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,220
After the matter is done, I will definitely go with the Western Sea soldiers

251
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,200
Help you to take back the Northern Heavenly Realm

252
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,080
Your Majesty

253
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:08,220
I have decided to go back to the Northern Heavenly Realm alone

254
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,900
Tian Hu's ceremony is about to start

255
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:15,600
You are alone and have no soldiers

256
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:20,000
If you go back, you will die

257
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:23,020
I see Kunlun Jun has been living and dying for two generations

258
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,220
I feel something

259
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,160
Now

260
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,840
He can take the Heavenly Star

261
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
But I

262
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,880
I can't even return to my hometown

263
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,580
I can only hide in the Western Sea

264
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:37,160
I can only live in this way

265
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,700
Besides

266
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,100
I don't want my relationship with Kunlun

267
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,500
to have any conditions

268
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,720
I don't want to stand by him in this way

269
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:57,660
But I'minaudible

270
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,820
In fact, Kunlun has done something similar

271
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,440
Tian Hu from the North tourists

272
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,960
Gave him the research

273
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,260
with Tan Wushuang

274
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,440
I will visit this advisory

275
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,060
and try to prove his responsibility

276
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,060
I've thought it through.

277
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,060
I'll take back the Northern Immortal Realm

278
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,060
and enter the Middle Heaven.

279
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,060
I'll take my leave.

280
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,060
Your Majesty, His Majesty is here.

281
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,060
Finally, it's this far.

282
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,060
Your Majesty.

283
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,060
Greetings, Your Majesty.

284
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,060
Your Majesty.

285
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,060
Kunlun has awoken.

286
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,060
Although he has not fully recovered,

287
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:16,060
but when can Your Majesty go and see him?

288
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,060
Now,

289
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,060
Jinxiu's Star of Heaven and Earth is bright,

290
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,060
but the whereabouts are unknown.

291
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:28,060
This is my hidden trouble.

292
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,060
I've also thought

293
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,060
whether Jinxiu's ceremony is not completed yet.

294
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:38,060
Is this the scene of the Star of Heaven and Earth?

295
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,060
The Goddess understands me.

296
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:44,060
Then why did His Majesty give him the fairy flag today?

297
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,060
If he is not the tea demon,

298
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,060
why do you care?

299
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,060
I don't know if he is the tea demon.

300
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,060
It's just a lowly person.

301
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:02,060
But he saved the people of Wuzhang.

302
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,060
If I don't give him the fairy flag,

303
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,060
how will the immortals think of me?

304
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,060
But,

305
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,060
if he interferes with the Star of Heaven and Earth,

306
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:14,060
it will be a disaster.

307
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,060
It's really His Majesty.

308
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,060
I understand.

309
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,060
Whether he is a human or a demon,

310
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:24,060
he is not worthy of being killed by the gods.

311
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:27,060
He is a chess piece under heaven and earth.

312
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,060
Please, Goddess,

313
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:35,060
please give us the eye of the West Sea

314
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:37,060
and watch the three stars.

315
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,060
Find Jinxiu as soon as possible.

316
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,060
The whereabouts of the King of Heaven and Earth are important.

317
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,060
I will do my best.

318
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,060
I know.

319
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,060
The longer the time,

320
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,060
the more power the power will be consumed.

321
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:54,060
If it's not important,

322
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,060
I will not let you be so tired.

323
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,060
This is my duty.

324
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,060
I will do my best.

325
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,060
I will do my best.

326
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,060
I will do my best.

327
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,060
I will do my best.

328
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,060
I will do my best.

329
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,060
I will do my best.

330
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,060
I will do my best.

331
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,060
I will do my best.

332
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,060
I will do my best.

333
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,060
I will do my best.

334
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,060
I will do my best.

335
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,060
I will do my best.

336
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,060
I will do my best.

337
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,060
I will do my best.

338
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,060
I will do my best.

339
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,060
I will do my best.

340
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,060
I will do my best.

341
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,060
I will do my best.

342
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,060
I will do my best.

343
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:45,060
I will do my best.

344
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:47,060
I will do my best.

345
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:49,060
I will do my best.

346
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,060
I will do my best.

347
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,060
I will do my best.

348
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,060
I will do my best.

349
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,060
I will do my best.

350
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,060
I will do my best.

351
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,060
I will do my best.

352
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,060
I will do my best.

353
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,060
One can do no blow and the other will turn vs the river.

354
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,060
One can do no blow and the other will turn vs the river.

355
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:21,060
I am afraid you are not with us.

356
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,060
Because we are no look What?

357
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,060
Because we are no look What?

358
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:27,060
Are you sure?

359
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:29,060
It wasn't you.

360
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,060
That was weird.

361
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,060
You must ask me

362
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,440
Jinxiu

363
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:43,180
Jinxiu, come out, don't play this kind of kid with me

364
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,620
Little ancestor, what are you shouting for? Why are you here?

365
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,540
I fell asleep a few days ago and turned around and forgot to find him

366
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,200
He came when he woke up

367
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,820
Where is he?

368
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,700
Master Jinxiu is not in HuaZhao Palace

369
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,440
Jinxiu

370
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,640
No, he is not here

371
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,640
Jinxiu, Jinxiu

372
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
It's you

373
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,920
Greetings, Kunlun Jun

374
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,160
You have become an immortal

375
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,360
Congratulations

376
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:19,520
I didn't expect to meet you again in Zhong Tian

377
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:24,360
Thank you and Master for saving the people in Wuzhang Kingdom

378
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,840
These are small matters, it's not a big deal

379
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,640
In fact, since you are here

380
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,240
Jinxiu must be far from here

381
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,840
I know Zhong Tian's people have no truth in their mouth

382
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,040
Master

383
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,040
really doesn't know what's going on

384
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,600
He really disappeared

385
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,800
Master has not returned yet, he is not in the three realms

386
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,240
Where is he

387
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:58,280
Why isn't King Zhong Tian back yet

388
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,500
Is the Letherities soul съel and scattered

389
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:15,800
soul ..

390
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:30,320
Your hands became thicker than it was hello

391
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:43,140
The

392
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:49,420
Unbreakable

393
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:54,720
My eyes,

394
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:59,800
I heard a little bit from your words

395
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:00,840
And then...

396
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,320
Where are you now

397
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Shen Zun, where are you?

398
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,600
Shen Zun

399
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,600
You can hear me

400
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,800
Where are you?

401
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
You disappear like this

402
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,800
Because I didn't wait for you at the Flame Bridge

403
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
Or you

404
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
Can't find your way home

405
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
Shen Zun

406
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
Shen Zun

407
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
I'm sorry

408
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,800
I should have been more careful

409
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,800
What's wrong with you?

410
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,800
Shen Zun

411
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,800
Shen Zun

412
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,800
Shen Zun

413
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,800
Shen Zun

414
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,800
Shen Zun

415
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,800
Shen Zun

416
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
Shen Zun

417
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,800
Why can't I find it?

418
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,800
Shen Zun

419
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Shen Zun

420
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,800
Shen Zun

421
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,800
Shen Zun

422
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,800
Shen Zun

423
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,800
Shen Zun

424
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,800
Shen Zun

425
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,800
Shen Zun

426
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,800
I just can't find it

427
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,800
Shen Zun

428
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
You're going to find my brother in Mount Baizhou?

429
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
I know you have doubts about my dream

430
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,800
But as long as there's hope

431
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,800
I have to try

432
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:42,800
I think his soul is in the flowers of Mount Baizhou

433
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,800
Something is trapped him

434
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,800
But I've led the heavenly soldiers to look for him everywhere

435
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,800
Even the west coast of my mother's eyes

436
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,800
Can see the three realms, see the yin and yang, see everything

437
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,800
I can't find him

438
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,800
How can you be sure he's in Mount Baizhou?

439
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,800
Because it's a dream

440
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,800
So I'm not sure

441
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:01,800
Okay, how are you going to find him?

442
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
Find every flower on Mount Baizhou

443
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
Every flower?

444
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,800
He's a flower god

445
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,800
The grass and the trees are all his eyes

446
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,800
Maybe he's in a place we can't see

447
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,800
A thousand years ago

448
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,800
I was trapped in the white-flower map

449
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,800
I had to count all the petals to get out

450
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:23,800
The ten thousand petals in this white-flower map

451
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,800
The petals are like stars

452
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,800
I counted a thousand years before I counted more than half

453
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:28,800
Do you know

454
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,800
How long it takes you to find all the flowers and trees on Mount Baizhou?

455
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,800
I know

456
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,800
If you really want to find him

457
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:40,800
I'm afraid it will take you a thousand years to finish your cultivation

458
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,800
And the heavenly world won't let you go down the mountain for so long

459
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,800
I've found a way to break it

460
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,800
What's the way to break it?

461
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,800
Find the middle god and borrow a thousand years

462
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
Borrow ten years?

463
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,800
This is a forbidden skill, what a joke

464
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
It takes you a thousand years to get it back

465
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,800
Calm down, okay?

466
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,800
You know how important he is to me

467
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,800
His god root is damaged because of me

468
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,800
So no matter what I do

469
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,800
A thousand years, even if I die

470
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
I have to find him

471
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,800
But you're taking risks just because of your dream

472
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,800
Even if it's a dream

473
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,800
But as long as there's hope

474
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,800
I should try

475
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
I'm a fairy who broke into this place

476
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,800
I have something important to ask

477
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,800
Please show yourself

478
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
What's the fairy's name?

479
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,800
Hongning?

480
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,800
When did you come back to Zhong Tian?

481
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,800
I'm not Hongning

482
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,800
But you're obviously Hongning

483
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:44,800
You want to use a forbidden skill

484
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,800
You can't get out of here

485
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,800
I'm not Hongning

486
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,800
You're not Hongning

487
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,800
You're not Hongning

488
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,800
You want to borrow a thousand years?

489
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,800
Yes

490
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,800
Why do you insist on this?

491
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
Although I do this

492
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Just because of my dream

493
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,800
Others may not believe it

494
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,800
But I have to find him

495
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,800
Zhong Tian, please help me

496
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,800
Do you know that a thousand years

497
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,800
Is actually your life?

498
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,800
Are you sure you don't regret it?

499
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,800
If I can't find him

500
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,800
I will regret everything

501
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,800
Master, he has always been kind to me

502
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,800
You can help him to save him

503
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,800
I will do whatever you want

504
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,800
Zhong Ai has been in the house for a thousand years

505
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,800
After a thousand years, Zhong Tian will be completely changed

506
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,800
You must come back before that

507
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,800
Hurry up

508
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,800
What if he doesn't come back after a incense?

509
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
Fall into the void

510
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,800
Bound by three elements

511
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,800
What?

512
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,800
What?

513
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,800
What?

514
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,800
What?

515
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,800
What?

516
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:00,800
What?

517
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,800
What?

518
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,800
What?

519
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,800
What?

520
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,800
What?

521
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,800
What?

522
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:06,800
What?

523
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,800
What?

524
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,800
What?

525
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,800
What?

526
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:10,800
What?

527
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,800
What?

528
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,800
What?

529
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:13,800
What?

530
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:14,800
What?

531
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,800
What?

532
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,800
What?

533
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,800
What?

534
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,800
What?

535
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,800
What?

536
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,800
What?

537
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,800
What?

538
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:22,800
What?

539
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,800
What?

540
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,800
What?

541
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,800
What?

542
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
What?

543
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:27,800
What?

544
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
What?

545
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,800
What?

546
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,800
What?

547
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
What?

548
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:32,800
What?

549
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,800
What?

550
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,800
What?

551
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,800
What?

552
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,800
What?

553
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,800
What?

554
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,800
What?

555
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,800
What?

556
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,800
What?

557
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,800
What?

558
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:42,800
What?

559
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,800
What?

560
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,800
What?

561
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,800
What?

562
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,800
What?

563
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,800
What?

564
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,800
What?

565
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,800
What?

566
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,800
What?

567
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,800
What?

568
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,800
What?

569
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,800
What?

570
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:54,800
What?

571
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,800
What?

572
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,800
What?

573
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,800
What?

574
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,800
What?

575
00:30:58,800 --> 00:30:59,800
What?

576
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,800
What?

577
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,800
What?

578
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,800
What?

579
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,800
What?

580
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,800
What?

581
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,800
What?

582
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,200
6000

583
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,800
thousand

584
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,800
thousand

585
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,800
thousand

586
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,800
thousand

587
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,800
thousand

588
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,800
thousand

589
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,800
thousand

590
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:20,800
thousand

591
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,800
thousand

592
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,800
thousand

593
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,800
thousand

594
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:24,800
thousand

595
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,800
thousand

596
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,800
thousand

597
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,800
thousand

598
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
thousand

599
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,800
thousand

thousand

00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
thousand

603
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,800
最近总是看到他们走过去

604
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,800
你 Frozen

605
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:39,640
为什么 Modern

606
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,860
这段时期了米

607
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,060
阿อ

608
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,100

609
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:44,640

612
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,520

613
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:45,880

614
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:45,980
走

615
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,080
走

616
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:46,680
走

617
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:46,940
走

618
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:47,100
走

619
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,360
走

620
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:47,520
走

621
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:47,860
走

622
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:47,920
走

623
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,160
走

624
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:48,420
走

625
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:48,600
走

626
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:49,120
走

627
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,580
走

628
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:49,940
走

629
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,120
走

630
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:50,480
走

631
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:51,000
走

632
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:51,220
走

633
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:51,660
走

634
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:52,320
走

635
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:52,660
走

636
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:52,900
走

637
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,120
走

638
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:53,320
走

639
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,040
走

640
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:55,020
走

641
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:55,960
走

642
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,620
走

643
00:31:57,220 --> 00:31:57,500
走

644
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:57,840
走

645
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,700
I still regret the past

646
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:09,840
For you, I will follow you for the rest of my life

647
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,840
When you get married

648
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,840
If the world is in a trance

649
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,840
I will marry you

650
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,840
It's a deal

651
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,840
It's a deal

652
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,840
If we calculate it

653
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,840
He has been here for 700 years

654
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,840
It's a waste

655
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,840
A dream for a thousand years

656
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,840
It's too much

657
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,840
What's wrong with this

658
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,840
There is a saying

659
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
The upper is poor, the lower is the emperor

660
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
What mortals can't do

661
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840
We can do it

662
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,840
But in theory

663
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,840
Mortals have never seen anything

664
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,840
How can they have such imagination

665
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,840
Why do mortals look at it with their eyes

666
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,840
The reason why immortals are immortals

667
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,840
Is because they should have magic

668
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,840
When these magic

669
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,840
Go to the mortal world, it becomes a legend

670
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,840
Give mortals hope and hope

671
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,840
I still can't find any clue

672
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,840
Master

673
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,840
Where are you

674
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,840
Time is almost up

675
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,840
Come out, fairy

676
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,840
Fairy

677
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,840
Come back, fairy

678
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,840
I'm punished with you

679
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,840
I can't wait

680
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,840
Master

681
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Where are you

682
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,840
Fairy, it's been a thousand years

683
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,840
It's time, come out

684
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,840
I feel I'm going to find him

685
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,840
Come back

686
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,840
If you don't come back, you can't come back

687
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,840
Fairy

688
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,840
Fairy

689
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,840
You're back

690
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,840
Do you know how dangerous it was

691
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,840
If I didn't use the magic

692
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,840
You would have been buried

693
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,840
I know, but

694
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,840
You are looking for my brother

695
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,840
Any clues

696
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,840
Don't take the risk

697
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,840
To save time

698
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,840
Your magic power is also half used

699
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,840
If my brother comes back

700
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,840
I don't want to see you like this

701
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,840
It's good to be back

702
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,840
It's good to be back

703
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,840
Where are you going

704
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,840
Tianhu is going to ascend the throne

705
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,840
I want to go back

706
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,840
Tianhu is controlling the whole North Fairy Realm

707
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:57,840
If you go back, can he let you live

708
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,840
I'm the daughter of the North Fairy Realm

709
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,840
I have something I have to do

710
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,840
Even if you have the responsibility of the star gang

711
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,840
You should think of a way to go back

712
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,840
Instead of going back alone

713
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,840
What else can you do

714
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,840
Except being caught

715
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,840
You and I are friends

716
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,840
I'm not afraid of you

717
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,840
What else can you do

718
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,840
You and I are friends

719
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,840
In your eyes

720
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,840
I'm just a person who doesn't prepare anything

721
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,840
I will only take risks

722
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,840
I won't let you go back alone

723
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,840
It's too dangerous

724
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,840
Kunlun, the North Fairy Realm is my home

725
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,840
No matter how weak the power is

726
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,840
I have to go back

727
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,840
My father is still in his hands

728
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,840
Then I will go back with you

729
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,840
You are the son of the Lord of the Heavens

730
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,840
You go back with me

731
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,840
Isn't it more

732
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,840
Besides

733
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,840
Now the relationship between the North Fairy Realm and Zhong Tian is so strong

734
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,840
You help me without permission

735
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,840
Will represent Zhong Tian's attitude

736
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,840
I know you are worried

737
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,840
But

738
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:05,840
I am the daughter of the Nine-tailed Fox Tribe

739
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,840
I came from the Ice River, the Snow Valley

740
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,840
My family is there

741
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,840
I must save them

742
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,840
What can I help you with

743
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,840
You do what you should do

744
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,840
You have to think about it in advance

745
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,840
If Zhong Tian Wang really can't come back

746
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,840
You, Kunlun

747
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,840
Must take on Zhong Tian

748
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:27,840
Fight for your Zhong Tian

749
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,840
You sir

750
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:04,760
Chu

751
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,840
Write the draw recipe

752
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,820
on the container

753
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,820
Look, look at the human blood.

754
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,820
Look.

755
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:28,820
Oh, right.

756
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,820
The light.

757
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:42,820
The light.

758
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:52,820
I am the fairy of the wood.

759
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,820
Greetings, fairy of the light.

760
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,820
No, no, no.

761
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,820
I am also a fairy.

762
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:57,820
I can't be any younger.

763
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,820
Fairy, please don't be polite.

764
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:02,820
Is it because the light in this place

765
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,820
has disturbed the peace of the heaven again?

766
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,820
I will clean it up immediately.

767
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,820
No.

768
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:08,820
I came here this time

769
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,820
to ask for something important.

770
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:10,820
Me?

771
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,820
What can I do?

772
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,820
I don't know if you still remember

773
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,820
that many years ago,

774
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:20,820
King Zhongtian set a lamp free on Mount Baizhou.

775
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,820
I want to know what is written on it.

776
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,820
This...

777
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,820
This is not good.

778
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,820
That is King Zhongtian's secret.

779
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,820
To be honest,

780
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,820
King Zhongtian is missing.

781
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,820
If we can find him,

782
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,820
we will do our best.

783
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,820
This time, Kunlun Jun asked me to come.

784
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:44,820
Wait a minute.

785
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:48,820
Really.

786
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,820
How dare you write anything?

787
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:50,820
This.

788
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,820
The moon will be more beautiful next year.

789
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,820
The moon will be more beautiful.

790
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,820
At the beginning,

791
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,820
I thought it was easy.

792
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,820
But King Zhongtian

793
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:10,820
likes a little monster.

794
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,820
He will be gone next year.

795
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,820
I will go to heaven and find him.

796
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,820
The moon will be more beautiful next year.

797
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:28,820
Mother.

798
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,820
Why are you here again?

799
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,820
I want to ask you to help me again.

800
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,820
You won't...

801
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,820
I want to take another chance.

802
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:41,820
The last chance.

803
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,820
Are you crazy?

804
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,820
You have already taken a thousand years.

805
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,820
If you take more time,

806
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,820
you may lose all your power.

807
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,820
Just one day.

808
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,820
But you haven't found it in a thousand years.

809
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,820
What can you find in one day?

810
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,820
Just one last day.

811
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,820
I can definitely find him.

812
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:07,820
Come and have a look.

813
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,820
It's comfortable.

814
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:10,820
It suits you.

815
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:12,820
Come again next time.

816
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,820
Okay.

817
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,820
Miss, come and have a look.

818
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:15,820
Miss,

819
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:17,820
we have the latest goods here.

820
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:18,820
All are the best.

821
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,820
Whichever you like,

822
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,820
you can try it.

823
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:28,820
Miss, you have a good taste.

824
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,820
This is the latest mask here.

825
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,820
It suits you.

826
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,820
It suits you.

827
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:35,820
Look at this pink.

828
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:36,820
It's so beautiful.

829
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:40,820
Take care, miss.

830
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,820
Remember to come again next time.

831
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,820
Thank you.

832
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:46,820
Come and have a look.

833
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,820
Miss, come and have a look.

834
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,820
The latest mask.

835
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:56,820
Everyone, come and have a look.

836
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,820
There are all kinds of food.

837
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:02,820
Come and have a look.

838
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,820
What's that?

839
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:16,820
I want you to play the lantern with me.

840
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:20,820
Go.

841
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:27,820
Others are always thinking about pursuing their eternal life.

842
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,820
But why do you only want to marry me?

843
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,820
I want to be with you.

844
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:39,820
I want to wait for you.

845
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,820
The wind blows away this life.

846
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:47,820
The heart is like a dream.

847
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:53,820
Have you ever thought about it?

848
00:42:54,820 --> 00:43:02,820
The time of falling flowers will come back.

849
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,820
I want to wait for a long time.

850
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,820
I want to wait for a long time.

851
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:12,820
The name of this life.

852
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,820
I still remember that day.

853
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,820
I still remember that day.

854
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:25,820
The time of falling flowers will come back.

855
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:32,820
I want to wait for a long time.

856
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:36,820
I want to wait for a long time.

857
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:38,820
The moon and the lantern have been waiting for a long time.

858
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,820
The army has returned.

859
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:53,820
The wind blows away this life.

860
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:58,820
The heart is like a dream.

861
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:04,820
Have you ever thought about it?

862
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:10,820
The time of falling flowers will come back.

863
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:13,820
I want to wait for a long time.

864
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:17,820
The army has returned.

865
00:44:17,820 --> 00:44:22,820
The white hand that is like a door.

866
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:27,820
The wind blows away this life.

867
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,820
The heart is like a dream.

868
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:36,820
Have you ever thought about it?

869
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:46,820
The time of falling flowers will come back.

870
00:44:46,820 --> 00:44:50,820
I want to wait for a long time.

871
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:55,820
The name of this life.

872
00:44:56,820 --> 00:44:58,820
I still remember that day.

873
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:01,820
I still remember that day.

874
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:09,820
The time of falling flowers will come back.

875
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:11,820
I want to wait for a long time.

876
00:45:11,820 --> 00:45:15,820
The wind blows away this life.

877
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:21,820
The name of this life.

878
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:24,820
I still remember that day.

879
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:27,820
I still remember that day.

880
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:35,820
The time of falling flowers will come back.

881
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:41,820
I want to wait for a long time.

882
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:48,820
The wind blows away this life.

883
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:54,820
The heart is like a dream.

884
00:45:54,820 --> 00:46:01,820
The time of falling flowers will come back.

885
00:46:01,820 --> 00:46:08,820
I want to wait for a long time.

886
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:15,820
Thank you for watching.
