1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,440
Let me be drunk

2
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,360
Only when the Condor Girls meet after przykład

3
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,800
Peinyu

4
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,800
I...

5
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,000
I just suddenly feel a little heart-pounding.

6
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
You have a heart-pounding skill?

7
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,200
You know medical skills?

8
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,200
I know a little.

9
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,200
Then, help me look at it.

10
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,800
I...

11
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:12,800
What are you doing?

12
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,400
Don't you know medical skills?

13
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,600
Just say it in a normal way.

14
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Normal way?

15
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,000
Normal way is...

16
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,200
When I first saw you,

17
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,200
when I saw you for the second time,

18
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,800
and when I saw you for the third time,

19
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I felt a little heart-pounding.

20
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
You have a heart-pounding skill.

21
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Heart-pounding skill?

22
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,200
What do you mean?

23
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,600
It's a disease.

24
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,600
Why would I have this disease?

25
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Why do you have so many?

26
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,400
Take a pen and draw it yourself.

27
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,400
I'll teach you.

28
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:51,800
Oh, right.

29
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,200
I forgot to ask you last time.

30
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
Why do you have so many wounds on your body?

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
It's none of your business.

32
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,200
You should put on this makeup yourself.

33
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
Don't make a fool of yourself again.

34
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,200
What's your name then?

35
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,200
We've known each other for so long.

36
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,800
I still don't know your name.

37
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,000
Jinxiu.

38
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,000
Jinxiu?

39
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,400
If I want to find you,

40
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,800
how should I find you?

41
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,600
Why are you looking for me?

42
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Why are you looking for me?

43
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,400
I always make mistakes here.

44
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,600
You know Zhao You.

45
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
I shouldn't look for you.

46
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,400
You really have no way.

47
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
This is Junyin Grass Flower Forest.

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,800
Say something.

49
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,000
Jinxiu.

50
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,200
Jinxiu.

51
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,200
So magical.

52
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,000
You can use it to find me in the future.

53
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,000
Jinxiu.

54
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,200
Jinxiu.

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,800
Jinxiu.

56
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,400
Jinxiu.

57
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:58,800
So annoying.

58
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,400
Jinxiu.

59
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,400
Jinxiu.

60
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,800
Jinxiu.

61
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,000
I once told you

62
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,000
to overcome love and love.

63
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,000
Only then will you have the power.

64
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,600
If you have a heart to entrust,

65
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,600
you can't be a qualified judge.

66
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,800
Jinxiu.

67
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,600
Jinxiu.

68
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,400
Jinxiu.

69
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,800
Overcome love and love.

70
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,600
Be self-disciplined.

71
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,000
Be happy.

72
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,000
Be self-disciplined.

73
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,600
Be self-disciplined.

74
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,600
Be self-disciplined.

75
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,800
Hongning.

76
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,600
Where are you?

77
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,000
I've said it a hundred times.

78
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,800
Hongning must have been caught by the flower god.

79
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,600
The tree monster, bird monster, rabbit, and elf saw it.

80
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,000
Why don't you believe it?

81
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
I don't believe it.

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,800
Hongning.

83
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,200
You're not my good friend anymore.

84
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,800
So what?

85
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,600
He made such a small mistake

86
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,400
and was going to be caught in the sky.

87
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
Then we two

88
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,400
are going to be caught eight hundred times.

89
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,400
Are we the same?

90
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,200
We are both thieves and devils.

91
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
Talking about the god's bad words.

92
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Is Hongning the same?

93
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,800
Hongning violated the flower god.

94
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,200
For example,

95
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,800
you slap the flower god.

96
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,200
Can the flower god not be hurt?

97
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,200
Not to mention the flower god is a divine punishment.

98
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,200
Oh, no.

99
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,400
Hongning is going to be skinned by the super elf.

100
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,800
Don't.

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I don't believe it.

102
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,600
I don't allow you to talk nonsense.

103
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,600
I don't believe he's gone like this.

104
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,200
Ning Mengmeng.

105
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,800
I'm begging you.

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,600
You...

107
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,200
Why don't you send someone

108
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
to inquire about it?

109
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,000
I've inquired about it a long time ago.

110
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,600
There's no news of the next White Shark after two days.

111
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,200
If it doesn't work, then it doesn't work.

112
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,800
Stop.

113
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,000
Hongning.

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,600
The flower god you just mentioned,

115
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,600
the divine punishment,

116
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,800
is it called Jinxiu?

117
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,400
Take me to where he has appeared.

118
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,800
Who are you?

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,400
You're being rude to ask someone to help you.

120
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,800
Do you want me to teach you?

121
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,000
Sir.

122
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,000
This way, please.

123
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,000
Please.

124
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,000
Come on.

125
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,600
Go, go, go.

126
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
You guys,

127
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,800
grow up here.

128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,800
Don't bully my red tea flowers.

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Help.

130
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Help.

131
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Help.

132
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Help.

133
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Help.

134
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,200
Help.

135
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Help.

136
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,400
Help.

137
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,600
Help.

138
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Help.

139
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,800
Help.

140
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,800
Help.

141
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,800
Help.

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
Help.

143
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,200
Help.

144
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,400
Are you okay?

145
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,600
I'm fine.

146
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
I'm fine.

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
I'm fine.

148
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,600
Are you okay?

149
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Fairy Jinxiu,

150
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,200
I'm fine.

151
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,600
It's so late at night.

152
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,800
What's going on?

153
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,200
The flower festival is coming.

154
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,400
I have to clean up this grass.

155
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
Only then can I grow my flowers.

156
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,000
Why don't you go to the Flower Forest?

157
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,400
Why are you here?

158
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,800
The Flower Forest is too crowded.

159
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,600
Only here can I grow my flowers.

160
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,600
Did the fairy send you here?

161
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,600
No wonder you can get the flower knot.

162
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
It's late.

163
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
Go back.

164
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
No.

165
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
I have to watch my flowers here.

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,600
Although the grass is low in spiritual power,

167
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,800
once it's activated,

168
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,600
it will be aggressive like just now.

169
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:01,200
It will easily absorb your spiritual power

170
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,000
and hurt your internal energy.

171
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,200
Then I have to watch my flowers.

172
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
If I can't grow flowers,

173
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,400
I can't attend the flower festival.

174
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,000
I can't see my flower god either.

175
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,600
Is it that important to see the flower god?

176
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,600
Of course it's important.

177
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,000
The flower god saved me.

178
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,000
So I have to see him.

179
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,600
And repay his kindness.

180
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Okay.

181
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,600
Then I'll tell you.

182
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,200
I am the flower god.

183
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,200
I know.

184
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,200
You know?

185
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Mr. Qu said he is the flower god.

186
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,800
Maybe hundreds of years ago,

187
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,200
I was also the flower god.

188
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,000
Who in the world is not a flower god?

189
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,600
The flower god I'm looking for is Zhao...

190
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,200
Zhao...

191
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,200
The flower god with the flower god seal.

192
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,800
I'm not like you.

193
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,800
You can't just hang around here.

194
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,600
You...

195
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,400
Okay, okay.

196
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,000
I know you're doing this for my sake.

197
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,400
I really can't help it.

198
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
I have to watch my flowers.

199
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,600
What should we do, Fairy Jinxiu?

200
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I'll go check the letter of the grass.

201
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,800
Go.

202
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,600
My flowers...

203
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,000
There's no other way.

204
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,800
You can put a protective talisman next to the flower seed.

205
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,000
I can't.

206
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,800
Increase the spirit energy.

207
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,600
Recite the command of the gods to protect the position.

208
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,800
The gods protect the position.

209
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,600
It's very important.

210
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,000
I can't do it.

211
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,400
The gods protect the position.

212
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,600
It's very important.

213
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,000
Recite the command.

214
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,000
Why isn't it working?

215
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,400
You haven't seen the basic practice.

216
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,200
This spell is really hard for you.

217
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
There's no other way.

218
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,200
After the talisman is removed,

219
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,600
plant it again.

220
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,400
Why don't you help me, Fairy Jinxiu?

221
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,600
The flowers of the flower festival are planted by the different tribes.

222
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,400
It's cheating to help you.

223
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,600
Then...

224
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
The gods protect the position.

225
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,600
Increase the spirit energy.

226
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
It's useless.

227
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
Other than me,

228
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,200
no one has ever been to the Soul Land.

229
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,600
I got it. Look.

230
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,200
You...

231
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,200
You're not as big as I was the first time.

232
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:32,400
Big?

233
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,600
The gods protect the position.

234
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
Increase the spirit energy.

235
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,000
Is it big?

236
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,600
It's because of my body.

237
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,600
It's big.

238
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:45,600
Let's go.

239
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,800
You live here?

240
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,200
This place looks nice.

241
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,000
But why do I feel

242
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,400
I've been here before?

243
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,400
Don't talk.

244
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,300
understand?

245
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,200
You're the boss for your others!

246
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,500
There is no other immediate remedy

247
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,400
for the 8-knot divided pack.

248
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm not that weak.

249
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,800
But still.

250
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,800
Why are you smiling so happily?

251
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,800
I told you to look for the earth grass.

252
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
I told you to look at this useless book.

253
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,800
Isn't this the book you put here?

254
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,800
I...

255
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,800
Besides, I'm not a...

256
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,800
Forget it.

257
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,800
We can only wait for a day and a night for her to disappear.

258
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,800
Really?

259
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,800
Really?

260
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:09,800
That's great.

261
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,800
I'm sleepy anyway.

262
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,800
I can sleep now.

263
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,800
Who allowed you to sleep here?

264
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,800
Get up.

265
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,800
What's wrong?

266
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,800
I...

267
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:24,800
I'm standing on your place.

268
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
How about I massage you?

269
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,800
You can sleep too.

270
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,800
A lonely man and a widow can't live together.

271
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,800
Besides,

272
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,800
how can you sleep together?

273
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,800
What does it mean by a lonely man and a widow?

274
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,800
It means that you and I can't stay in the same room.

275
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,800
But there's no one else here.

276
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,800
How about you call some more people in?

277
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
You...

278
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Nonsense.

279
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,800
I...

280
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,800
It's not appropriate for others to see us like this.

281
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,800
That's not okay.

282
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,800
I don't care.

283
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,800
I'm going to sleep.

284
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,800
Come on.

285
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:12,800
Get up.

286
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,800
So,

287
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,800
we can't stay in the same room,

288
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
but we can take a bath together.

289
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:47,800
Shut up.

290
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,800
I...

291
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,800
Let me be quiet.

292
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,800
In the pond,

293
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,800
there's a small pond.

294
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,800
It's not a big one.

295
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,800
It's a small pond.

296
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
It's a small pond.

297
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Before the pond is opened,

298
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,800
you can stay here.

299
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
Why do I have to stay here?

300
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,800
To practice.

301
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
The flower is pretty.

302
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,800
What's over there?

303
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,800
It's quiet over there.

304
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,800
What about over there?

305
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,800
Don't disturb me.

306
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:36,800
I'm going to sleep.

307
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,800
I'm going to sleep.

308
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,800
I'm going to sleep.

309
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,800
I'm going to sleep.

310
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,800
I'm going to sleep.

311
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,800
I'm going to sleep.

312
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,800
I'm going to sleep.

313
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,800
I'm going to sleep.

314
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,800
I'm going to sleep.

315
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,800
I'm going to sleep.

316
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:46,800
I'm going to sleep.

317
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:47,800
I'm going to sleep.

318
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,800
I'm going to sleep.

319
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,800
I'm going to sleep.

320
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,800
I'm going to sleep.

321
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,800
I'm going to sleep.

322
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,800
I'm going to sleep.

323
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,800
I'm going to sleep.

324
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,800
I'm going to sleep.

325
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,800
I'm going to sleep.

326
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,800
I'm going to sleep.

327
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
I'm going to sleep.

328
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,800
I'm going to sleep.

329
00:16:58,800 --> 00:16:59,800
I'm going to sleep.

330
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,800
I'm going to sleep.

331
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,800
I'm going to sleep.

332
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:02,800
I'm going to sleep.

333
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,800
What are you doing?

334
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
Hey, what are you doing?

335
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,800
Isn't this used to soak the dates?

336
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,800
Hurry up and come up.

337
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
This is fun.

338
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Are you coming down?

339
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,800
I'm not coming down.

340
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:41,800
Come up.

341
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:42,800
You come down.

342
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,800
You come up quickly.

343
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
Is it fun?

344
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Fun.

345
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,800
You just heard something.

346
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,800
You heard it wrong.

347
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,800
Go over there and take a look.

348
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,800
Okay.

349
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Wake up.

350
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,800
Wake up.

351
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,800
Wake up.

352
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,800
What's wrong with you?

353
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
Why is your face so red?

354
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,800
Nothing.

355
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:01,800
Look.

356
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,800
The flowers have bloomed in the middle of the night.

357
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,800
What did Master Shen Zun meet that made him so happy?

358
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
Shut up.

359
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,800
Look. Look.

360
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
That shy grass.

361
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
His head is down.

362
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,800
Master Shen Zun.

363
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Did he encounter something embarrassing?

364
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
No.

365
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Don't talk nonsense.

366
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:36,800
They all say that Master Shen Zun looks cold on the surface.

367
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,800
But his activities are very rich.

368
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,800
Shut up.

369
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,800
You said that Master Shen Zun is also very strange.

370
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,800
It feels like no one can see that Master Shen Zun has any emotions.

371
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,800
But his flowers.

372
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,800
There. There.

373
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:53,800
They all showed up.

374
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
You shut up.

375
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,800
Don't guess the mind of the flower god.

376
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,800
Okay.

377
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,800
What's wrong with you?

378
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Master.

379
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,800
You let someone cook it.

380
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:40,800
Why is it so wet?

381
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,800
You let someone roast it.

382
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,800
Why is it so wet?

383
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,800
Put it in the Water Moon Mirror.

384
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,800
Yes.

385
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,800
How long will it take?

386
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,800
Six to seven years.

387
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,800
The earth will be in a mess.

388
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Go and plant the petals.

389
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:56,800
Yes.

390
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,800
Don't catch a cold.

391
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,800
You haven't finished the thunder.

392
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,800
What's wrong with you?

393
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Do you know why I locked you up?

394
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
I'm not going to lock you up.

395
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:27,800
You said you were fine.

396
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Why did you go into the flower spring?

397
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,800
I want to soak the grass.

398
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
You can't soak the grass in another place.

399
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,800
Soak the grass. Soak it. Soak it.

400
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
Tell me.

401
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,800
How did you get in?

402
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,800
Jinxiu took me in.

403
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:46,800
You. You.

404
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,800
You and him.

405
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
He came to find me in the flower forest.

406
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
We read books together.

407
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,800
Then we slept together.

408
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,800
We soaked our bellies together.

409
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,800
Why?

410
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,800
Why did you let me know so much?

411
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Am I going to find him for evidence?

412
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
You're forcing me to die.

413
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,800
You can ask him.

414
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,800
Anyway, I'm telling the truth.

415
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,800
You.

416
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
I.

417
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,800
I.

418
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
Xu Xiangguan.

419
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
I'm begging you.

420
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
I must go to the photo exhibition.

421
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,800
I must see the painting of God.

422
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
You. You. You.

423
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Shut up.

424
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Is it time to miss the photo exhibition?

425
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,800
I regret coming here.

426
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,800
If I didn't come here for the record.

427
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,800
I. I'm telling you.

428
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,800
What you said.

429
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,800
Do you think I'm going to write or not?

430
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
I'm begging you.

431
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,800
I'm telling you.

432
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,800
One word is useless.

433
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,800
Two words.

434
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,800
Two words.

435
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Enough.

436
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,800
Anyway, I'm telling you.

437
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,800
No matter what you say.

438
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,800
I won't agree.

439
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,800
Go in.

440
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,800
Hurry up.

441
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,800
Where is it?

442
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,800
Go.

443
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,800
The painting of God.

444
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,800
Count the flowers.

445
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:19,800
When you count all the petals in the picture.

446
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,800
You can come out.

447
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
Count it slowly.

448
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,800
Count the petals.

449
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,800
This painting of flowers.

450
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,800
This painting.

451
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
Is made by the fairy.

452
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
It's used to torture people.

453
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,800
Even if a fairy.

454
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
Come in for ten years and twenty years.

455
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
You have to peel it.

456
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,800
Not to mention you.

457
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
A little monster who is good at cultivation.

458
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,800
Who are you?

459
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,800
Kunlun God.

460
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,800
You are the one who is mixed with the devil.

461
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,800
Even the monster knows me.

462
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:12,800
It seems that I'm quite popular.

463
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,800
Then.

464
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,800
You are the brother of God of Flower.

465
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,800
You know I'm the brother of God of Flower.

466
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,800
Then you must know.

467
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,800
How to get out.

468
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:34,800
Of course, count the petals.

469
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:37,800
Impossible.

470
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,800
You must know other ways.

471
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,800
You are really not a normal little monster.

472
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,800
Demon King.

473
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:49,800
Then how to get out.

474
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,800
Count the petals.

475
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
Flower petals.

476
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:12,800
I'm here.

477
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,800
I'm here.

478
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,800
I'm here.

479
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,800
I'm here.

480
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:16,800
I'm here.

481
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,800
I'm here.

482
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,800
I'm here.

483
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:19,800
I'm here.

484
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,800
I'm here.

485
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:21,800
I'm here.

486
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:22,800
I'm here.

487
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,800
I'm here.

488
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,800
I'm here.

489
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,800
I'm here.

490
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,800
I'm here.

491
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,800
I'm here.

492
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,800
I'm here.

493
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,800
I'm here.

494
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:30,800
I'm here.

495
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,800
I'm here.

496
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,800
I'm here.

497
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,800
I'm here.

498
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,800
I'm here.

499
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,800
I'm here.

500
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,800
I'm here.

501
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
I'm here.

502
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,800
I'm here.

503
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,800
I'm here.

504
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,800
I'm here.

505
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:41,800
OK.

506
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:03,800
Stop it.

507
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,800
So tired.

508
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,800
I don't know if the deity is telling the truth or not.

509
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,800
Does Shen Zun really like this dance?

510
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,360
What about you?

511
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,240
Do you like it?

512
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,680
You are my shadow.

513
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,040
Of course, you are the same as my idea.

514
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,600
Go on.

515
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,440
Since it's doing this again,

516
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,840
I should enjoy the dance too.

517
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,400
Here you are

518
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,960
Obedient

519
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,000
Why wait so much?

520
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,440
Young Lord

521
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,160
walked like her

522
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,880
looking down

523
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,300
What's wrong?

524
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,840
Madam

525
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,020
Madam

526
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,800
Young Lady

527
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,680
Young Lord

528
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,080
This is how you look good

529
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,360
Young Sir

530
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,400
Greetings, Master

531
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:19,620
What?

532
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,940
All the immortal ladies

533
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,620
are in the stir-fried garden

534
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,420
preparing for the last awards

535
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:24,700
it just happened that

536
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,760
these days against the cold

537
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,700
protection of the 말을 is rather difficult

538
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,340
The Pierre changes

539
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:33,980
are already którzy

540
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,620
Yes, all the immortal ladies

541
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,060
It's our master's show

542
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,660
But these days

543
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,020
there will no longer

544
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,580
be such evil seal

545
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,840
Right?

546
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,840
I understand.

547
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,840
I'll take my leave.

548
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,840
I'll take my leave.

549
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,840
Then help me look.

550
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,840
Jinxiu.

551
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,840
Jinxiu.

552
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,840
Jinxiu.

553
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,840
Jinxiu.

554
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,840
Your Majesty, you really are just like everyone else.

555
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,840
You have such a bad temper.

556
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,840
Her temper is not just bad.

557
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,840
Although she was born with my classmate,

558
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,840
her desire is far different.

559
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,840
What does she look like?

560
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,840
She has three heads.

561
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,840
Each head has a sharp corner.

562
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,840
Her mouth is open like a volcano.

563
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,840
Her face is wide and wide.

564
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,840
Her body is like a cow.

565
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,840
Her back is like a pig's wing.

566
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,840
So elegant?

567
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,840
Then I must go to the painting meeting.

568
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,840
If I miss it, I won't be able to see her.

569
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,840
Yes.

570
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,840
I forgot again.

571
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:39,840
Counting this petal is harder than counting the stars in the sky.

572
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,840
Yes.

573
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,840
Unless...

574
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,840
This is the day when the clouds will be gone.

575
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,840
Otherwise, I can't count it all.

576
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

577
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

578
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

579
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

580
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

581
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

582
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:26,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

583
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

584
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

585
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

586
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:34,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

587
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

588
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

589
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

590
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

591
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

592
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

593
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

594
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

595
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

596
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

597
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:56,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

598
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

599
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

600
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

601
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

602
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

603
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

604
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

605
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:12,840
The day when the clouds will be gone?

606
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,840
The day when two flowers fall into talking bubbles

607
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,840
The day when benefits of flowers turned into salient

608
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,160
The day when two stones turned into rising sp와

609
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,840
Let's hope we can choose to playonte

610
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,840
Let's hope we can rest easy

611
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,840
Let's hope we can rest easy

612
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,520
Then the festival day over

613
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,520
Then the festival day over

614
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:39,040
We're going to have

615
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,420
a very interesting talk

616
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:44,420
Otherwise, no one can let her out.

617
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,420
Your flowers are so beautiful.

618
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,420
Your flowers are also beautiful.

619
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,420
Immortal.

620
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,420
Immortal.

621
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,420
How is Hongning?

622
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,420
Do you know?

623
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,420
You have to prepare yourself.

624
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,420
Don't plan anymore.

625
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,420
Yes.

626
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,420
Yes.

627
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,420
You guys, stop chatting.

628
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,420
The flower festival is very important.

629
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,420
When the Heavenly Maid comes,

630
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,420
don't make any mistake.

631
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,420
Yes.

632
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,420
The flower festival officially begins.

633
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,420
Welcome, God of Flower.

634
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,420
Welcome, God of Flower.

635
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,420
Welcome, God of Flower.

636
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,420
Welcome, God of Flower.

637
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,420
Welcome, God of Flower.

638
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:21,420
That's God of Flower.

639
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,420
Lower your voice.

640
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:25,420
Didn't you see Hongning's end?

641
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,420
What a pity.

642
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,420
Hongning has worked so hard.

643
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:29,420
But he still failed.

644
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:34,420
The Heavenly Maid of Northern Heaven is here.

645
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,420
So beautiful.

646
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,420
So beautiful.

647
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,420
This beautiful Heavenly Maid

648
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:42,420
is so beautiful.

649
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,420
No.

650
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,420
Why does the Heavenly Maid dance?

651
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,420
All the flowers in the sky are the flowers of the star.

652
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,420
Yes.

653
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:13,420
Shut up.

654
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,420
Hongning.

655
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:24,420
Hongning.

656
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,420
Hongning.

657
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,420
Hongning.

658
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,420
Hongning.

659
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,420
Hongning.

660
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,420
Hongning.

661
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,420
Hongning.

662
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,420
Hongning.

663
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,420
Hongning.

664
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,420
Hongning.

665
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,420
Hongning.

666
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,420
Hongning.

667
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,420
Hongning.

668
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,420
Hongning.

669
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,420
Hongning.

670
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,420
Hongning.

671
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,420
Hongning.

672
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,420
The dance of the Heavenly Maid is so pretty.

673
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:03,420
It's so outstanding.

674
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,080
The flower festival is a big event.

675
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,720
I didn't have time to come empty-handed.

676
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,720
So I prepared this dance as a gift.

677
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,020
It's not good.

678
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,520
I'm sorry.

679
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:16,020
You came here to see the performance of the flower festival.

680
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,020
Why do you have to bother yourself?

681
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,820
No need.

682
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,820
As long as you like it.

683
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:24,820
Please come this way.

684
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,320
Give me wine.

685
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,420
Give me lily wine.

686
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:35,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

687
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,420
Heavenly Maid, please taste it.

688
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:55,420
This wine is really good.

689
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,020
How is this wine made?

690
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,720
It smells so good.

691
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:01,420
Since Heavenly Maid is here,

692
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,420
I will announce one thing.

693
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,420
What is it?

694
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,420
I don't know.

695
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,420
Is it about the marriage with Heavenly Maid?

696
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,920
Stop!

697
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:22,920
Kunlun Jun, why is she following us?

698
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,420
What do you mean by following us?

699
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,420
We can't come out after counting the petals.

700
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,720
Move aside.

701
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,920
If I don't come, you will die.

702
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,420
I will help you.

703
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,920
You don't even know how to say thank you.

704
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,720
Stop!

705
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,920
I have been in charge of the flower festival for thousands of years.

706
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,920
I am grateful for everyone's help during this period.

707
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,420
That's why the flower festival is so prosperous.

708
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,920
But I can't stay here forever.

709
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,420
So I decided to choose twelve flowers from this flower festival.

710
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:02,920
The twelve flowers will be used together to protect the flower festival

711
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,420
and to make our family long-lasting.

712
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:09,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

713
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,920
You are the best in the world. Why don't you know how to fly?

714
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,920
If I knew how to fly, I would be the best in the world.

715
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,420
You are right.

716
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,920
There are 99 flowers and flowers in this flower festival.

717
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,420
They are all together.

718
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:32,920
This is the best of our family.

719
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:35,920
Thank you for your help.

720
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,920
The flower ceremony begins.

721
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,920
The flower ceremony begins.

722
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,920
The flower ceremony begins.

723
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,920
The flower ceremony begins.

724
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,920
The flower ceremony begins.

725
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

726
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,920
The flower ceremony begins.

727
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:14,920
The flower ceremony begins.

728
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:18,920
The flower ceremony begins.

729
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,920
This is the flower you prepared.

730
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,920
I am sorry.

731
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,920
The flower ceremony begins.

732
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,920
Please help me check if my eyebrows are the same.

733
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,920
Yes, they are.

734
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,920
What about me?

735
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,920
You are the same.

736
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,920
My flowers are not even a little bit...

737
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,920
The Yulan Flower Clan's flower ceremony begins.

738
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,920
The Yulan Flower Clan greets Your Majesty.

739
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,960
The paint curled up, the color faded.

740
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,960
Can't see the rest of the leaves.

741
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,960
You may leave.

742
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,920
Yes.

743
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,920
What should I do?

744
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:13,920
I am so angry...

745
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,420
Dear Mdm,

746
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,420
ula Elixir is the last fairy chosen for today.

747
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,920
Do you think that's enough?

748
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,920
Do you think it can be over?

749
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,400
Let's end it

750
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,400
The flower ceremony ends here

751
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,400
God of Flower

752
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,400
Wait

753
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,400
Me?

754
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,400
I'm sorry

755
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,400
You dare to interrupt me?

756
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:21,400
Aren't you in the flower ceremony?

757
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,880
How dare you interrupt the flower ceremony?

758
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,880
Can't you finish counting the petals?

759
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:31,880
God of Flower

760
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,880
