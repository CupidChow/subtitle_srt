1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm drunk.

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The light in the painting

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
is the only thing that can bring us together.

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The Legend of Chusen

5
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Episode 14

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Why haven't I seen you recently?

7
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I've been asking the birds to send you letters,

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
but you haven't replied.

9
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Every time you send me letters,

10
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
you always ask me if I'm there.

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What do you want me to reply?

12
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm afraid to bother you.

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I want to wait for you to reply,

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
yes, I'll keep thinking.

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I've been here.

16
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Have you ever thought of me?

17
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
What about you?

18
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I miss you every day.

19
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You've been practicing recently.

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Why haven't you improved?

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You've even regressed.

22
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
From tomorrow on,

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
you should practice hard.

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Am I useless?

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I've been practicing so slowly.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
When can I be your queen?

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's not easy to practice.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm not a good dancer.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm not good at dancing.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm not good at everything.

31
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But I heard that

32
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
there's a little red tea flower in the flower garden.

33
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
A few days ago,

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
it was in the garden.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I also heard that

36
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
the fairy of Yueji was sick.

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's all because of that little red tea flower.

38
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
It takes care of itself day and night.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
That's why it can recover so fast.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
You know all these?

41
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Of course.

42
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
How can I not care about my little red tea?

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But I still want to

44
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
complete the journey before the Flower Festival.

45
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Don't worry.

46
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Just practice.

47
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
After this Flower Festival,

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
there's another one.

49
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'll be waiting for you.

50
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
How can there be

51
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
such a perfect fairy in this world?

52
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Not bad.

53
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Who told me to

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
take on the responsibility of writing the real thing?

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're so perfect.

56
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
You didn't say that?

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
It's okay.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
You say it.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Magistrate Xu,

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I've been busy all day.

61
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Why do I have

62
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
such little cultivation?

63
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
All the fairies

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
are gradually

65
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
improving their skills to become the High Immortal.

66
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Magistrate Xu,

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
aren't you the greatest official?

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You must know a lot.

69
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Can you tell me

70
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
how to become the High Immortal in advance?

71
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Of course I know.

72
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
But I can't tell you.

73
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You can't tell me?

74
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
You don't know anything.

75
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
You're still pretending to be a scholar.

76
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You mean me?

77
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What do you mean?

78
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Is there anything I don't know?

79
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll tell you.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Isn't it the magic of Mount Baizhou?

81
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Mount Baizhou?

82
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm impulsive.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm still on the fire.

84
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I'll go first.

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Mount Baizhou.

86
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
There is such a magic book

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
that can invite the Heaven's Day in advance.

88
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But I've lived for so long.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I've never seen anyone who has succeeded.

90
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
If you're not careful,

91
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
you'll be destroyed

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,620
and become a

93
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You mustn't try it easily.

94
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Okay, I know.

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Thank you.

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm Hongming.

97
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll ask for the Heaven's Day in advance.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I hope you'll give me the credit.

99
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm Hongming.

100
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll ask for the Heaven's Day in advance.

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Hongning, are you crazy?

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You're stupid.

103
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You'll get into trouble if you go through the disaster in advance.

104
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You don't want to live anymore.

105
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't worry.

106
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I've already gone through the Heaven's Day of adults.

107
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's okay.

108
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
What if there's an accident?

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Hongning, you saved my life.

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I can't just watch you die in front of me.

111
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But I'm not going to die.

112
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm going to die.

113
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm going to die.

114
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I'm going to die in front of you.

115
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
But since I have memories,

116
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I have to find the God.

117
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
He's too important to me.

118
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I have to do everything for the important person.

119
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Do everything for the important person?

120
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Xiao Bai,

121
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
you'll understand when you have an important person.

122
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I've already asked for the Heaven's Day.

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You should go.

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:38,000
You said you'd do everything for the important person.

125
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Hongning,

126
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
to me,

127
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
you're the most important person.

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm not interested.

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I want to die in front of you.

130
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Stop!

131
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
White Tea Monster, you've already gone through the Heaven's Day.

132
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Who allowed you to enter Hwa Zhao Palace?

133
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I...I want to see Lord Flower Deity first.

134
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Are you kidding me?

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
You can see the Lord Flower Deity wherever you want to.

136
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I have an important thing

137
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
to tell him.

138
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
White Tea Demon, why are you still here?

139
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Immortal Mei.

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
How dare you break into Hua Zhaogong without any reason?

141
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Please forgive me, Immortal Mei.

142
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I really have something very urgent and important to report.

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I had to use this method.

144
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Hurry and arrest him!

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What is it?

146
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Xing Xing, you can leave first.

147
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
But...

148
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Tell me.

149
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I want to beg you to let Lord Hua Shan save Hong Ning.

150
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Save Hong Ning?

151
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
In order to become an immortal as soon as possible,

152
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
he asked for the Heaven Realm in advance.

153
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
The Heaven Realm is coming.

154
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Only Lord Hua Shan can save her.

155
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Hong Ning is in danger.

156
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Why would you want Lord Hua Shan to save her?

157
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Because Hong Ning is in danger because of her.

158
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Shut up!

159
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Do you know how much this matter will affect you?

160
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
But Hong Ning...

161
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Don't mention what happened today.

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Leave Hua Zhaogong immediately.

163
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Otherwise, I can only send you to Zhong Tian Tian Prison.

164
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I will go.

165
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
White Tea.

166
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Your surname is Xian?

167
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Immortal Mei doesn't want to help you.

168
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I will help you.

169
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
You will help me?

170
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Although you punished me for what happened before,

171
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
I don't think I did anything wrong,

172
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
but I also delayed your marriage.

173
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
This time, I will make up for it.

174
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Then...

175
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Can you help me see Lord Hua Shan?

176
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Of course.

177
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
But right now, Lord Hua Shan is not here.

178
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I will take you to Zhong Tian.

179
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I will take you to Zhong Tian.

180
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
You went to Zhong Tian with all your might,

181
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
just to ask Lord Zhong Tian to save that red tea demon?

182
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Your Highness.

183
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
I know I was expelled from Heaven.

184
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
It is a grave crime to trespass here.

185
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I am willing to take all the blame.

186
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I just hope that Lord Zhong Tian can see her.

187
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Hong Ning is very stubborn.

188
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,000
No one can stop her except Lord Zhong Tian.

189
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What did that red tea demon do to you

190
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
that you are willing to risk your life to save her?

191
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I have no intention of being lonely.

192
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Hong Ning saved me.

193
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
She was the one who was bullied by me and helped me get out.

194
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
Only she is the best in this world.

195
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
So I have to be good to her.

196
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Your friendship is so deep.

197
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It is really touching.

198
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
It is a pity that I am the only one who knows this story.

199
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Your Highness.

200
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Your Highness.

201
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Lord Zhong Tian is about to get married.

202
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000
How can he be so rude to a little red tea demon?

203
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
If this news spreads,

204
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
I will be doomed.

205
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
What is the point of being doomed?

206
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
White tea demon.

207
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You are the one who is guilty of this.

208
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
You are guilty of defying the divine order.

209
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Guards.

210
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Take her to the Qilin Cave.

211
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Your Highness, please spare me.

212
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I don't know the reason.

213
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
It is just that the white tea demon said it was about Zhong Tian.

214
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I had no choice but to take her to Zhong Tian.

215
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Please forgive me.

216
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
I understand your good intentions.

217
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
This matter involves Lord Zhong Tian.

218
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,000
This love knot seems to be inevitable.

219
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
How about putting the red tea demon into the Qilin Cave?

220
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I'm afraid the lucky fairy doesn't know love yet.

221
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Love is the more you block it, the more powerful it is.

222
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
To solve the trouble of love,

223
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
you can only follow it.

224
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
What do you mean?

225
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Forget it.

226
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Since the red tea demon can't see Lord Zhong Tian,

227
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
let's forget about this matter.

228
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You have done a good job.

229
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Go back and wait for the reward.

230
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The godess won't save the red tea demon?

231
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Then, do I still need to report this matter to His Majesty?

232
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I will report this matter to His Majesty.

233
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Yes.

234
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
I'll take my leave.

235
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
The lucky fairy took the white tea demon to Zhong Tian.

236
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Leave now.

237
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Don't bother about the fairy.

238
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Let me go!

239
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The godess asked you to wait here.

240
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
The red tea demon is here.

241
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Go.

242
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Go.

243
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Go.

244
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Go.

245
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Go.

246
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Go.

247
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Go.

248
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Go.

249
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Go.

250
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Go.

251
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Go.

252
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Go.

253
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Go.

254
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Tian, you should go now.

255
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Or else, the thunder will be strong.

256
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
No.

257
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
If we hadn't been beaten by the thunder,

258
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
you would have been in danger.

259
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
You want to recover?

260
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I've been practicing for a long time.

261
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm not the same person as before.

262
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
No.

263
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
No matter how strong you are,

264
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
you're still a little flower.

265
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
We can't be strong enough.

266
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
You can carry it for her.

267
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
No.

268
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Tian Lei,

269
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
what's there to be afraid of?

270
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'm telling you, I'm just too lazy to be an immortal.

271
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Little Tian Lei.

272
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
With my status,

273
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'm afraid that even my shadow will be defeated.

274
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Ning Mengjie!

275
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Ning Mengjie!

276
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Ning Mengjie!

277
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Hong Ning!

278
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Take care of her.

279
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Hong Ning!

280
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Hong Ning!

281
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Hong Ning!

282
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I greet you, Father.

283
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
The days are not good enough.

284
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Three days later,

285
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
you will marry the Heavenly Daughter of the Northern Immortal Realm.

286
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Father,

287
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Father,

294
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm sorry.

295
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Father!

298
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I've already put the Golden Lotus Robe into your body.

299
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
This marriage

300
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
can't be rejected by you.

301
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Father!

302
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
You just stay here

303
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
and think about the past.

304
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
When you figure it out,

305
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
you will let it go.

306
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Father!

307
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Hong Ning is in trouble.

308
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I have to save her.

309
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,280
Master,

310
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,280
release her.

311
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,280
Release her.

312
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,280
Release her.

313
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,280
Much better!

314
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,680
Hong Ning.

315
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,560
Yes!

316
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,400
I must participate in your wedding ceremony.

317
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,680
How can I sleep?

318
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,160
I only want you to be alone.

319
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,200
That is my true love.

320
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,020
It is too much.

321
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,420
You still want to stay by my side.

322
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,280
You only want to stay apart from me

323
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,440
and the Commission.

324
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,000
So that people should bePeaple of thebeep.

325
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Shen Jingtai, I'm sorry.

326
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Shen Jingtai.

327
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
I love you.

328
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I love you, Chen Gongyu.

329
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Hong Ning, don't worry.

330
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
I will never let anything happen to you.

331
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I love you.

332
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I love you.

333
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I love you.

334
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
The End

335
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Your Majesty,

336
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
in order to refuse the marriage of the Northern Immortal Realm,

337
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
Jinxiu has been kneeling for three days and three nights.

338
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:45,360
Were you

339
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
Do you have to come to Cangwu Mountain

340
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
to be a guardian?

341
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
I beg Your Majesty to grant my wish.

342
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
What a great grant!

343
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Father!

344
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
This marriage is not over yet.

345
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It's not up to you.

346
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
I'll draw out your spirit sense.

347
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Don't think about it anymore.

348
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I'm sorry.

349
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Hongning!

350
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
You're finally awake, Hongning!

351
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Shaoyao...

352
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Be careful!

353
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Shaoyao...

354
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
I've successfully crossed the border.

355
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Hongning, since you're fine,

356
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
you should leave now.

357
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
I've successfully crossed the border.

358
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
I can stay in Huaizhao Palace now.

359
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
What's wrong with you?

360
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
The King of Zhong Tian

361
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
King of Zhong Tian, please.

362
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
King of Zhong Tian, please.

363
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Hongning,

364
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
today is the wedding day

365
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
between King of Zhong Tian and the Heavenly Maid of the Northern Immortal Realm.

366
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Don't be too sad.

367
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
The Heavenly Maid of the Northern Immortal Realm, please.

368
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
King of Zhong Tian, please.

369
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
King of Zhong Tian, please.

370
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
The Heavenly Maid of the Northern Immortal Realm, Lu Yao.

371
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Until the day of your death,

372
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
you'll be a god.

373
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
The Heavenly Maid of the Northern Immortal Realm, Lu Yao.

374
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
What's going on?

375
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
Your Majesty, the Queen of the Northern Immortal Realm,

376
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
King of Zhong Tian's unknown edict.

377
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I don't know why you can't remember it.

378
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
I don't understand.

379
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
If you can't remember the edict,

380
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
then change to another edict.

381
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
The red thread is written on the edict.

382
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It represents the long term.

383
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
It's the tradition and rule of Zhong Tian.

384
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,000
Enough.

385
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Don't waste time on such a small thing.

386
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
Since the Northern Immortal Realm

387
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
doesn't have the etiquette to sign the red thread,

388
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
then you're dismissed.

389
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,000
Yes.

390
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
The Queen of the Northern Immortal Realm,

391
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
please.

392
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Your Excellency.

393
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Your Excellency.

394
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Your Excellency.

395
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
Your Excellency.

396
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Your Excellency.

397
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,000
Your Excellency.

398
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,000
Your Excellency.

399
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,000
Your Excellency.

400
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Your Excellency.

401
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
Your Excellency.

402
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,000
Your Excellency.

403
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Your Excellency.

404
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,000
Your Excellency.

405
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,000
Your Excellency.

406
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Your Excellency.

407
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Your Excellency.

408
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Your Excellency.

409
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,000
Your Excellency.

410
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Your Excellency.

411
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Your Excellency.

412
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,000
Your Excellency.

413
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Your Excellency.

414
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Your Excellency.

415
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,000
Your Excellency.

416
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
Your Excellency.

417
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Your Excellency.

418
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,000
Your Excellency.

419
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,000
Your Excellency.

420
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,000
Your Excellency.

421
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
You can just ask for it.

422
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,000
How dare you

423
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
stop the fallen fallen inputs

424
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
and leading them to enter the avoidance ceremony.

425
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Fengchacido obeys the Buddha

426
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
and airs a funeral tied to the enablement of processes.

427
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
Your Excellency.

428
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,200
Give her some wine and sit down.

429
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,400
Master.

430
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:16,560
Didn't you say

431
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,240
you wouldn't marry the Heavenly Maid?

432
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,560
Let go!

433
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,560
Lord Zhong Tian.

434
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,440
What's wrong with the Fairy Hua?

435
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Lord Zhong Tian.

436
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,440
Isn't this the red-brained little demon that just became a fairy?

437
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,600
This is the dream of snatching Lord Zhong Tian and the Heavenly Maid.

438
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,600
I didn't expect Lord Zhong Tian to be so crazy.

439
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,000
This little fairy is so obsessed with her dreams.

440
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,400
She wants to marry Lord Zhong Tian.

441
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,800
But Lord Zhong Tian must be going to marry the Heavenly Maid.

442
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,400
She's already made up her mind.

443
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,800
But this kind of thing can't be shown on stage.

444
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,000
I came today

445
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,800
to congratulate Master

446
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,600
on getting married to the Heavenly Maid.

447
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
I know that

448
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
the blood of the Heavenly Empress

449
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,400
is the blood of the first medicine.

450
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,200
The second medicine is the God's will.

451
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,400
The third medicine is the cultivation of the cultivation of virtue.

452
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,200
The Heavenly Maid is the daughter of the Heavenly God.

453
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,200
Only the Heavenly Maid

454
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
can marry Master.

455
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
Marry.

456
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,400
May the Lord and the Heavenly Maid

457
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,600
be together forever.

458
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,400
I love you, Wu Di.

459
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:35,800
Brother.

460
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,800
Lord Zhong Tian.

461
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,600
Where is the Golden Lotus Robe in your body?

462
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,000
Why is it missing?

463
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,400
I'll take it out now.

464
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,400
Golden Lotus Robe.

465
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,800
Golden Lotus Robe.

466
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,400
Golden Lotus Robe is a drop of gold.

467
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,000
Why is it on this little fairy?

468
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,800
Your Majesty.

469
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,000
Is this how you treat the Pei Xian Realm?

470
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,200
I've underestimated the Pei Xian Realm.

471
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,600
Lord Wei Jie, please don't leave.

472
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,600
I will give you an explanation.

473
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,000
Why is the Golden Lotus Robe on her body?

474
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,600
You are so stubborn.

475
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Come on.

476
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,200
Take the red tea.

477
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,800
Push it into the Flower Fairy Pool.

478
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,200
Take the Golden Lotus Robe back.

479
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
Take it.

480
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:43,200
I'm here.

481
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,000
Who dares to touch it?

482
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,600
Get her back.

483
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,600
Hong Nian, are you okay?

484
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,000
Master.

485
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,400
Did I disappoint you?

486
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:12,800
No.

487
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,600
Is it because I didn't get the Golden Lotus Robe?

488
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,800
That's why you married the Heavenly Maid?

489
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,400
No.

490
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,200
Hong Nian, don't mind this.

491
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,600
Leave now.

492
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,800
I will explain it to you later.

493
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,600
Master, what's wrong with you?

494
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,400
Don't mind this.

495
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,400
Leave now.

496
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,400
Listen to me.

497
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,400
Leave.

498
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,200
I won't leave.

499
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,200
Why?

500
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:45,200
I will explain it to you later.

501
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
I will explain it to you later.

502
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
I will explain it to you later.

503
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,800
His Majesty said

504
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,800
the Golden Lotus Robe is with me.

505
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,000
If you didn't give me the Golden Lotus Robe,

506
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,400
I might not be able to escape from the Heaven Realm.

507
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,200
I would have been dead.

508
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,800
What are you talking about?

509
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,400
Right?

510
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,200
As long as I jump into the Flower Fairy Pool,

511
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,600
the Golden Lotus Robe can stay.

512
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,200
What are you talking about?

513
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,400
Hong Nian!

514
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,400
Hong Nian!

515
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,800
Hong Nian!

516
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,000
No!

517
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
Master.

518
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,400
Master.

519
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
When I'm not with you,

520
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
you must take the Golden Lotus Robe

521
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,000
and be with the Heavenly Maid.

522
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,600
No.

523
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,000
Hong Nian, no!

524
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,400
No.

525
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
Forget me.

526
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Hong Nian!

527
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,400
Hong Nian!

528
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,400
Hong Nian!

529
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,400
Hong Nian.

530
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,400
Hong Nian.

531
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,400
Hong Nian.

532
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,400
Hong Nian.

533
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,400
Hong Nian.

534
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,400
Hong Nian.

535
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,400
Hong Nian.

536
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,400
Hong Nian.

537
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,400
Hong Nian.

538
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,400
Hong Nian.

539
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,400
Hong Nian.

540
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,400
Hong Nian.

541
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
Hong Nian.

542
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,400
Hong Nian.

543
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,400
Hong Nian.

544
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,400
Hong Nian.

545
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,400
Hong Nian.

546
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,400
Hong Nian.

547
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,400
Hong Nian.

548
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:40,400
Hong Nian.

549
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,400
Hong Nian.

550
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,400
Hong Nian.

551
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,400
Hong Nian.

552
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,400
Hong Nian.

553
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,400
Hong Nian.

554
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,400
Hong Nian.

555
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,400
Hong Nian.

556
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,400
Hong Nian.

557
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,400
Hong Nian.

558
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,400
Hong Nian.

559
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,400
I kept this Eye- Mechanic

560
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,400
outside for 300 years.

561
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,800
Around 10 points,

562
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,560

the

567
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,840
Don't come in in person.

568
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,800
What capacity does he have to torture your Royal Highness The veel?

569
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,300
Su Long?

570
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,400
Hey...

571
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:35,800
Kill me!

572
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,600
Stop playing the guqin 2016.

573
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,880
Cheers.

574
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,600
My brother is poles along when he is in the Shenfa Hall.

575
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,480
You can't wait here.

576
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,960
Who says that I'm here to see him?

577
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,600
But I used the Hall to subscribe just now.

578
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,240
Am I not shy enough?

579
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,560
Didn't you come find him?

580
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,360
Perhaps you came to find me?

581
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,600
Your hair is so painful.

582
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,600
Why don't you move?

583
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,600
Jianxiu is my brother. He owes you.

584
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,600
I'll pay for him.

585
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:32,600
Stop pretending to be a good person.

586
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:34,600
As you wish.

587
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,600
You can laugh at me now.

588
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,600
What's so funny?

589
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:43,600
I've always looked down on you.

590
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,600
I think you're a good person.

591
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,600
You're good at pretending.

592
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:49,600
You're angry, but you're pretending to be fine.

593
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:51,600
You're unhappy, but you're still trying to be nice.

594
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,600
Stop pretending to understand me.

595
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,600
I'm just a bad person.

596
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,600
This kind of thing is not worth my heart.

597
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,600
Then why are you here waiting for Jianxiu?

598
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:07,600
None of your business.

599
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,600
The King of Heaven

600
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:28,600
King of Heaven

601
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:30,600
Why are you still in the North Fairy Realm?

602
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,600
The incident in front of the Zhong Tian Hall

603
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,600
was caused by Jianxiu.

604
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,600
He knew he was innocent.

605
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,600
He came to atone for his crimes.

606
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:40,600
King of Heaven, when you were back to your coma,

607
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,600
did you take the North Fairy Realm into your eyes?

608
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:44,600
General Tian Hu,

609
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,600
King of Heaven,

610
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,600
what you did

611
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,600
made the North Fairy Realm lose face.

612
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,600
You made the Heavenly Maid very sad.

613
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,600
How are you going to atone for your crimes?

614
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,600
The Jinxiu Court will be the next county.

615
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,600
Go to Cangwu Mountain and be the first person.

616
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,600
Guard Zhong Tian and the North Fairy Realm.

617
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,600
I'm sorry.

618
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,600
What?

619
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,600
What about your marriage with the Heavenly Maid?

620
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,600
Report!

621
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:17,600
Report to the King. The Heavenly Maid said she wouldn't see him.

622
00:45:18,600 --> 00:45:20,600
Go and see her again.

623
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,600
Yes.

624
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,600
King of Heaven,

625
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,600
this matter is clearly solved.

626
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,600
Do you have to do this?

627
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,600
You're Zhong Tian's superior.

628
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:39,600
Why bother?

629
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,600
King of Heaven,

630
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,600
I'm sorry for my sins.

631
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:45,600
I just hope that this matter

632
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,600
won't affect Zhong Tian and the North Fairy Realm's friendship.

633
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,600
Okay.

634
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,600
If that's the case,

635
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,600
go to Cangwu Mountain.

636
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,600
Thank you, King of Bejie.

637
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,600
I'll take my leave.

638
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:25,600
What is King of Heaven thinking?

639
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,600
Even if he's thinking like this,

640
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,600
can't he marry the Heavenly Maid?

641
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,600
King, he's clearly insulting the Heavenly Maid.

642
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:35,600
Stop talking!

643
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,600
Go!

644
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,600
Tell the Heavenly Maid

645
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,600
everything that King of Heaven said.

646
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:45,600
Since King of Heaven doesn't dare to face the Heavenly Maid,

647
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:47,600
let the Heavenly Maid

648
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,600
persuade her.

649
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,600
Even now,

650
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:56,600
you still want the Heavenly Maid

651
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,600
to take the initiative to marry him?

652
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:00,600
What do you know?

653
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,600
King of Heaven,

654
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,600
you call yourself a man of the Mountain?

655
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,600
Who do you think you are?

656
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,600
It's obvious that

657
00:47:13,600 --> 00:47:15,600
the Heavenly Maid gave us

658
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,600
the face of the North Fairy Realm.

659
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,600
The North Fairy Realm

660
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,600
faces a situation where people can be abandoned.

661
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:34,600
It's all because you are a coward.

662
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:37,600
What did you say?

663
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:40,600
Do you believe that I'll break your military order?

664
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:45,600
The North Fairy Realm faces such a situation.

665
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:51,600
What right do you have to be King of Bejie?

666
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,600
Do you want to rebel?

667
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,600
Guards!

668
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,600
Guards!

669
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,600
I thought that

670
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,600
you are the Heavenly Maid's father.

671
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:18,600
That's why I gave you one last chance.

672
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,600
It's a pity

673
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,600
that you can't cherish me.

674
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,600
You!

675
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,600
I regret

676
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,600
not taking action earlier.

677
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:41,600
They are all laughing at me.

678
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,600
Heavenly Maid, the King is assassinated.

679
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,600
How dare you

680
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,600
to be so rude in the Heavenly Maid's Pavilion!

681
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,600
Heavenly Maid, the King is assassinated.

682
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,600
General Tian Hu sent us here

683
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:04,600
to ask you to go to the inner palace to protect you.

684
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,600
Nonsense!

685
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:07,600
Tian Hu is a wolf-like man.

686
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,600
The King must have been killed by him.

687
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:11,600
Do you want to help Zhao Wei Yue?

688
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:13,600
Heavenly Maid, Lord Qi Jing,

689
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:15,600
the wise should be wise.

690
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,600
If you insist on doing so,

691
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,600
I'll blame you for being rude.

692
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,600
You are dead!

693
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,600
I'm sorry.

694
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:02,600
I'm sorry.

695
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:04,600
I'm sorry.

696
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,600
I'm sorry.

697
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:08,600
I'm sorry.

698
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:10,600
I'm sorry.

699
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,600
I'm sorry.

700
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,600
I'm sorry.

701
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,600
I'm sorry.

702
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,600
I'm sorry.

703
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,600
I'm sorry.

704
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,600
I'm sorry.

705
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,600
I'm sorry.

706
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:26,600
I'm sorry.

707
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,600
I'm sorry.

708
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,600
I'm sorry.

709
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:32,600
I'm sorry.

710
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,600
I'm sorry.

711
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,600
I'm sorry.

712
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,600
I'm sorry.

713
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,600
I'm sorry.

714
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,600
I'm sorry.

715
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,600
I'm sorry.

716
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,600
I'm sorry.

717
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,600
I'm sorry.

718
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,600
I'm sorry.

719
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,600
I'm sorry.

720
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:54,600
I'm sorry.

721
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,600
I'm sorry.

722
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,600
I'm sorry.

723
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,600
I'm sorry.

724
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,600
I'm sorry.

725
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,600
I'm sorry.

726
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,600
I'm sorry.

727
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,600
I'm sorry.

728
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,600
I'm sorry.

729
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,600
I'm sorry.

730
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:14,600
I'm sorry.

731
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,600
I'm sorry.

732
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:18,600
I'm sorry.

733
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,600
I'm sorry.

734
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:22,600
I'm sorry.

735
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:24,600
I'm sorry.

736
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:26,600
I'm sorry.

737
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:28,600
I'm sorry.

738
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,600
I'm sorry.

739
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,600
I'm sorry.

740
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,600
I'm sorry.

741
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,600
I'm sorry.

742
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,600
I'm sorry.

743
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,600
I'm sorry.

744
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:42,600
I'm sorry.

745
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,600
I'm sorry.

746
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,600
I'm sorry.

747
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,600
I'm sorry.

748
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,600
I'm sorry.

749
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,600
I'm sorry.

750
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:54,600
I'm sorry.

751
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:56,600
I'm sorry.

752
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:58,600
I'm sorry.

753
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,600
I'm sorry.

754
00:52:00,600 --> 00:52:02,600
I'm sorry.

755
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,600
I'm sorry.

756
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,600
