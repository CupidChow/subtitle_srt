1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
A imperial seemed familial, 2008

2
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:12,140
An anniversary sword

3
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,360
A faceless knight

4
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:29,500
Six-line world

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Only I am drunk

6
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In the flower, you

7
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Only waiting for the flowers to bloom

8
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Only I am drunk

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
In the flower, you

10
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Only waiting for the flowers to bloom

11
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Can I be your fairy when I become an immortal?

12
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Can I be your fairy?

13
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
A red silk silk

14
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
The new person is signing the embroidered ball

15
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
The new person is coming to the hall

16
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
The real person is the king of the royal village, Hong Ning

17
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Until this auspicious day

18
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The couple is to hold the crown and bow

19
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
When the wind blows

20
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
The rain is blowing

21
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The bride and groom are holding hands

22
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The bride and groom are holding hands

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The bride and groom are holding hands

24
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
The bride and groom are holding hands

25
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Who is the one who loves to accompany

26
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Who is the one who has a cup of tea to drink with the moon

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I don't ask about the past

28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I don't regret the past

29
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The flower is in full bloom

30
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
If you don't like it

31
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't want to be a flower

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I bow to the high court

33
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I only wish to be with you for the rest of my life

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
The couple is to hold the crown

35
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
The bride and groom are holding hands

36
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The bride and groom are holding hands

37
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The wedding is over

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Great

39
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Wait

40
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
What's wrong, master?

41
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
According to my home town habit

42
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I have to apologize for Hong Ning

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Apologize for Hong Ning?

44
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Who fell into the dust for the sake of love

45
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Don't ask the past is or not

46
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
The love is deep and the past is not regretful

47
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Turn the wind and forget the sword

48
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Falling into the heart

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I don't want to be a flower

50
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Give up the heart of the past

51
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Only wish to be with you for life

52
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I learned it, I will learn it from now on

53
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You have to come to this life

54
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Please welcome the bride to the bridal chamber

55
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Wait a minute

56
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Isn't this a new couple?

57
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Send to the bridal chamber

58
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Master, today is your big day

59
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Are you so anxious?

60
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't drink with our apprentices

61
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Let us also stick to the wedding shoes

62
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Master, your rules are not useful

63
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
This is a custom of Cangwu Mountain

64
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Hurry up and bring the bride into the bridal chamber

65
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Bridal chamber

66
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Good good

67
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Good

68
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Wait a minute, I'll go back right away

69
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Bring the bride

70
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Good good

71
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Good good

72
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Master, congratulations

73
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Congratulations congratulations

74
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Congratulations congratulations

75
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Congratulations, master

76
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Finally, finally becoming the wife of the master

77
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Although I have experienced so many hardships

78
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
To be able to go this far

79
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
But everything is worth it

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I am here, who dares to move

81
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Girl

82
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I didn't come here on purpose

83
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
This is your love letter

84
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I am here

85
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Shen Jinglan

86
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
This life

87
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
We must be together

88
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Old friends

89
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Come, drink a little

90
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Eat more

91
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Eat well

92
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
We are going to go first

93
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Eat slowly

94
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
What are you doing?

95
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Don't worry

96
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Come, come, come

97
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Come, come, come

98
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Come, come, come

99
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Eat, drink, everyone

100
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Don't let you be in trouble

101
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Good good

102
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Uncle, aunt

103
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Aunt, aunt

104
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Eat more

105
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Come, come, come

106
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Good good good

107
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Why hasn't this uncle arrived yet?

108
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Should be here

109
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Report

110
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Cangwu Mountain is under a barrier

111
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We can't pass for the time being

112
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Don't worry, someone will break the barrier

113
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Ready to attack Cangwu

114
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
This red tea drug again

115
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Jinxiu, you know he has the power of the devil

116
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Still want to marry him

117
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Prepare for heaven's law

118
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Be sure to go back

119
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
God of Flower

120
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Happy day

121
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Give you a big gift

122
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Will arrive soon

123
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Hurry up

124
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Why is there such a move?

125
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The soul of the evil world has appeared.

126
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I must hurry and go take a look.

127
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Stop.

128
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
This is the Hongning City Formation, right?

129
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What does it have to do with you?

130
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm the one who's going to destroy it.

131
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
What does it have to do with you?

132
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Inform the imperial physician.

133
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The barrier of the warehouse has appeared.

134
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
We can enter the temple.

135
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
If you want to get the secret,

136
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
you must kill the evil.

137
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Yes.

138
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I can't say it.

139
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Look.

140
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
The red one is the one with the silver one.

141
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
It's different from what I know.

142
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
It's a man.

143
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I don't know what it is.

144
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Master.

145
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Where are you going?

146
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
You guys continue drinking.

147
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
We're all going to die.

148
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Master.

149
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
You can't go in there.

150
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
You're a little bit of a spirit.

151
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Why are you fighting with me?

152
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Today is the Holy Lord's big meeting.

153
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You guys come and give me a big gift.

154
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Come with me to the Cangwei Academy.

155
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Think of it as a heaven and earth.

156
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Come out.

157
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Come out.

158
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
Come out.

159
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Master.

160
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Why did you lead the army into my warehouse?

161
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Don't be so rude.

162
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
If you're not obsessed with it,

163
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
why should I go out in person?

164
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
We have to make it like this today.

165
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Isn't it a two-way?

166
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Jinxiu.

167
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Just for a little bit of a demon,

168
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
are you going to stand in the middle of the field?

169
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Jinxiu.

170
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Bai Buqi.

171
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Bai Buqi.

172
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Bai Buqi.

173
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
This way.

174
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
This way.

175
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
The dungeon.

176
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
The dungeon.

177
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
Guards.

178
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
Go to the dungeon and check it out.

179
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Yes.

180
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Hold on.

181
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
I didn't do anything wrong.

184
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Bai Buqi.

185
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Bai Buqi.

186
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Go.

187
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Master, there are demons outside.

188
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
They're all coming in.

189
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
We can't stop them.

190
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
We've killed many disciples.

191
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Go and defend them.

192
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Bai Ling, go and inform Master.

193
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Bai Buqi.

194
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Why are you still here?

195
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
It's dangerous here. Go back.

196
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
No one is going to leave today.

197
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Junior.

198
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
It's you.

199
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
You opened the door.

200
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Kill them.

201
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
All disciples of Canghu, listen.

202
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Go now.

203
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Go.

204
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Master.

205
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Mother.

206
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Mother.

207
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Mother.

208
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Mother.

209
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
Mother.

210
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Mother.

211
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Qian Tianxing, I'm the most important one.

212
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Bai Ling, take all disciples.

213
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Go and find Shunzi and Huni.

214
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
You go first. I'll take care of them.

215
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You're hurt. Go.

216
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Go.

217
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
You want to go?

218
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's not that easy.

219
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Go.

220
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
No.

221
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Go. You'll be fine.

222
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Go.

223
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Okay. Be careful.

224
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Go.

225
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Go.

226
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Go.

227
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
Master.

228
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Master.

229
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
How are you?

230
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Are you okay?

231
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Qian Tianxing.

232
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
You saved me.

233
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
You're the best.

234
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'll go back to Canghu.

235
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'll do my best.

236
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I'll save you.

237
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'll save you.

238
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'll save you.

239
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
I'll save you.

240
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I'll save you.

241
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
I'll save you.

242
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
I'll save you.

243
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
You two are too selfish.

244
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
You two are too selfish.

245
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You two are too selfish.

246
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Master.

247
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Master.

248
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Master.

249
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Bai Chao.

250
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
Master saved you and took you in.

251
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
You treated me so well.

252
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
I didn't expect you to be so kind.

253
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The master you're talking about

254
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
is only for Hongning

255
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
that he left us for now.

256
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
You...

257
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Did you know

258
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
that he once

259
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
made a mistake

260
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
and left me?

261
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
What did he do to me?

262
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I'll kill you.

263
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Say it.

264
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
He's a hypocrite.

265
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I'll forgive you.

266
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I, a disciple of Canghu,

267
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
have no fear

268
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
and no weakness.

269
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I'm not a coward.

270
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I won't be a coward.

271
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
You bastard.

272
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
You're a bastard.

273
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
You didn't apply the medicine.

274
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
This silver needle

275
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
is made of my special poison.

276
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
You won't live long.

277
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
It's ridiculous.

278
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
A few silver needles

279
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
can't be used on me.

280
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
You...

281
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
You bastard.

282
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's time

283
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
to find the bride.

284
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm sorry.

285
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I'm sorry.

286
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I'm sorry.

287
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I'm sorry.

288
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm sorry.

289
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
I'm sorry.

290
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm sorry.

291
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
I'm sorry.

292
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
I'm sorry.

293
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm sorry.

294
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
I'm sorry.

295
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm sorry.

296
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I'm sorry.

298
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
You bastard.

299
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
dieseh hardship

300
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

301
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

302
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

303
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

304
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

305
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

306
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

307
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

308
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

309
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

310
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

311
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

312
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

313
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

314
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'm not sure if I can do it!

315
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

316
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

317
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I'm not sure if I can do it.

318
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
It's c Box!

319
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
It's c Box!

320
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
It's c Box!

321
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
It's c Box!

322
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
It's c Box!

323
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
It's the understanding school!

324
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The understanding school!

325
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
It's the understanding school.

326
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,720
Certainly the

327
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:21,460
urn

328
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,140
How would this have happened

329
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,860
Why can't I wait for less than three seconds

330
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,520
Be careful

331
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,900
70%

332
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,420
The demon has attacked the Cangwu Mountain.

333
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:02,100
They are still inside.

334
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,900
Go and save them.

335
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,620
What a joke.

336
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,820
The Cangwu Mountain is not our territory.

337
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,860
What are you doing here?

338
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,500
I'm here to capture the Demon King Hong Ning

339
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,260
by the order of the Heaven and Earth.

340
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,780
Where is he?

341
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,380
Demon King?

342
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:19,700
How is that possible?

343
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,820
I'm training

344
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,340
to become a god.

345
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,820
I didn't expect you to be

346
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,620
all immortals.

347
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,220
You are so unruly.

348
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:28,940
You are not even close to death.

349
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,900
You are so unruly.

350
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,620
How dare you!

351
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,860
You dare to kill my god?

352
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,820
Take him down!

353
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,460
Yes!

354
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,820
Commander,

355
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,460
he is the Star of Heaven and Earth.

356
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,820
The order of the God is to

357
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,100
stop the Demon King from

358
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,140
killing him.

359
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,780
Do it now!

360
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:45,420
Yes!

361
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:45,980
Yes!

362
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:00,740
My god.

363
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:03,740
I know it's me !

364
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,720
Nick...

365
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,300
No!

366
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:09,500
No!

367
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,300
Who's there?

368
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,060
Yingyao White wooden Palace again with Dokkyei uniqueguitar

369
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:36,500
You of beast Demon King, it's another world.

370
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,700
How you dare you make trouble here.

371
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:54,420
Who are you? Look at that

372
00:24:57,660 --> 00:25:00,640
Then don't you forget your place.

373
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,640
not forgot

374
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:05,640
I am not the King of Heaven, but the Heaven-bearing Beast.

375
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,640
I will not let you down.

376
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,140
Baili.

377
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,640
Yes.

378
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,640
Go save Huni.

379
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,140
Yes.

380
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,640
Go save Huni.

381
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,640
Go.

382
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,640
Go.

383
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,640
Brother, why is it like this?

384
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,640
Brother.

385
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,640
No.

386
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,640
You are a traitor.

387
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,640
Go!

388
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,640
Go!

389
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,640
No!

390
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,640
I'm the one who killed him!

391
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,640
It's me! It's me!

392
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,640
Bailing!

393
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,640
It's all my fault!

394
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,640
It's all my fault!

395
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,640
It's all my fault!

396
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:58,640
Master!

397
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
Bailing!

398
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,640
Hong Ding! Hong Ding!

399
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,640
Hong Ding! Hong Ding!

400
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,640
Hong Ding, run!

401
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:29,640
Run!

402
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,640
Ning Meng Qing!

403
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,640
Run!

404
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,640
What's wrong?

405
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,640
Hong Ding, they're here to catch you!

406
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,640
Run!

407
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,640
I'm not going!

408
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,640
Run!

409
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,640
Ning Meng Qing!

410
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,640
Ning Meng Qing!

411
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,640
Ning Meng Qing!

412
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,640
Ning Meng Qing!

413
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,640
Ning Meng Qing!

414
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,640
Ning Meng Qing!

415
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,640
Come with me!

416
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,640
They killed Ning Meng Qing!

417
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,640
I'm going to avenge them!

418
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,640
Calm down!

419
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,640
The Heavenly Lord has released the demons!

420
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,640
The whole Cangwu Mountain is surrounded!

421
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:20,640
With our strength, we can't defeat them!

422
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,640
Why are they here?

423
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,640
Have you forgotten what I said?

424
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,640
It's Jin Xiu!

425
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,640
Jin Xiu wanted to use your strength to gather the demons!

426
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,640
He has already informed the Heaven Realm about this.

427
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,640
Today, the Heaven Realm is here to fight the evil!

428
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:40,640
Impossible!

429
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,640
Master is not that kind of person!

430
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,640
Hong Ning!

431
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,640
You still don't believe me?

432
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,640
I'll take you to him now!

433
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,640
I'll show you what kind of person he is!

434
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,640
Let's go!

435
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,640
It hurts so much!

436
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,640
Kill me!

437
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,640
If you hurt the soul, we can't survive!

438
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,640
I'll definitely save you!

439
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,640
Master!

440
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,640
I'm sorry!

441
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,640
We have to protect them!

442
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:17,640
If we fight with our lives,

443
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,640
I won't lose to them!

444
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,640
Master...

445
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,640
I'm sorry, Master!

446
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,640
I didn't hear you.

447
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,640
I've been missing the Heavenly Maid for days!

448
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,640
I don't have a chance now.

449
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,640
When I see her,

450
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,640
please tell her my feelings!

451
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,640
Do it!

452
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,640
Ke Le...

453
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,640
I'm sorry for not protecting you.

454
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,640
I'll let you experience your own death!

455
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
Ke Le!

456
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,640
When you become the Heavenly Maid,

457
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,640
you must tell her your feelings!

458
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
Ke Le!

459
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,640
Ke Le!

460
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,640
Ke Le!

461
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,640
Ke Le!

462
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,640
Go and save the Queen!

463
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,640
Ke Le!

464
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,640
Ke Le!

465
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,640
Ke Le!

466
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
Father!

467
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,640
Father!

468
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,640
Father!

469
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,640
Father!

470
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,640
Mother!

471
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,640
Mother!

472
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,640
Father!

473
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,640
Father!

474
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,640
Mother!

475
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,640
Mother...

476
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,640
Father!

477
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,640
Mother!

478
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,640
Father,

479
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,640
I've got something for you.

480
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,640
I want to buy you a warm pot.

481
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Let your fat body burn for a few days.

482
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,640
Don't be afraid, daughter.

483
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,640
When you become the village chief,

484
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,640
you'll earn more money.

485
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,640
I'll buy you a house.

486
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,640
Your hands will never get cold.

487
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,640
Father!

488
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,640
Father!

489
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,640
Father!

490
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,640
Father!

491
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,640
Father!

492
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,640
Father!

493
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,640
Father!

494
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,640
Father!

495
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,640
Father!

496
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,640
Father!

497
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,640
Father!

498
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,640
Father!

499
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,640
Father!

500
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,640
Father!

501
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,640
Father!

502
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,640
The power of the King.

503
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,640
Father!

504
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,640
Father!

505
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:15,640
Don't come over!

506
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,640
Don't come over!

507
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,640
What is this bracelet?

508
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:35,640
It's a bracelet that contains the power of the King of the Demons.

509
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,640
This person, from the beginning to the end,

510
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,640
is not trying to kill me.

511
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:41,640
He just wants to use you to gather everyone

512
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,640
and then kill them all together.

513
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:47,640
I especially asked for this to be given to you.

514
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:49,640
I wish you a good rest.

515
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,640
I wish you peace.

516
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,640
I...

517
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,640
am the King of the Demons?

518
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,640
Of course you are.

519
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,640
The Heavens sent someone to invite us.

520
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,640
Why did you lie to me?

521
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,640
Hong Ning.

522
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:09,640
Don't come over!

523
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,640
The murderer.

524
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,640
Why did you kill my parents?

525
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,640
It's not what you see.

526
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:19,640
Why did you let the whole Cangmu Mountain

527
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,640
be flooded with blood?

528
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,640
Hong Ning.

529
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,640
Hong Ning!

530
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,640
What is this?

531
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:53,640
The King of the Mountain

532
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,640
had such a good heart.

533
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,640
This person...

534
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,640
You said you would love me

535
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,640
But you

536
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,640
Grew up with me for 40 years

537
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,640
But my family and friends

538
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,640
All died in front of me

539
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,640
So your boyfriend

540
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:19,640
Was me

541
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:24,640
You

542
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,640
You

543
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,640
You are mine

544
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,640
I will never leave you

545
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,640
I don't want you

546
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,640
You

547
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,640

From now on

552
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,640
Only hatred

553
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,640
I am sorry

554
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,640
You are all

555
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,640
Liars

556
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,640
If there is a future

557
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,640
I will find you

558
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,640
Then

559
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,640
Then I will go to the mountain

560
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,640

Don't go

566
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,640
You

567
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,640
Wake up

568
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,640

No

600
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,640
He died before

601
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,640
The people that we sent onüy

602
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,640

Magistrate

605
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,640
I can't go there now.

606
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,640
Why?

607
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:18,640
Tian Bixia!

608
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:20,640
The gods are coming!

609
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,640
Master Shen Zun!

610
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,640
Master Shen Zun!

611
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,640
Master Shen Zun, why are you here?

612
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,640
I want to go in.

613
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,640
No, no, no.

614
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,640
Master Shen Zun, I'm sorry.

615
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,640
Let him in.

616
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:58,640
Don't tell anyone about this.

617
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,640
Yes, yes, yes.

618
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,640
Even if I'm thrown into the painting pool, I won't say a word.

619
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:06,640
Come here.

620
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,640
There's no barrier here.

621
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,640
You won't be found.

622
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,640
Just tell me what you want to say.

623
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,640
I just want to know if you made a move on the Soul-locking Spell.

624
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,640
What's the point of being apart?

625
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:44,640
The long journey has long gone with the wind.

626
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:51,640
When will we meet again?

627
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:57,640
Like the white snow in the south.

628
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:04,640
I don't know if this life is a dream or a dream.

629
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:10,640
You once fainted in the clouds.

630
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,640
The falling flowers are falling.

631
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:23,640
We meet again.

632
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:30,640
Please change your name for a lifetime.

633
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,640
I still remember that day.

634
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:42,640
The falling flowers are falling.

00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:49,640
We meet again.

Please change your name for a lifetime.

00:44:55,640 --> 00:45:01,640
I still remember that day.

638
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:08,640
The falling flowers are falling.

639
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:14,640
We meet again.

640
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:21,640
Please change your name for a lifetime.

641
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:28,640
The falling flowers are falling.

642
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:34,640
We meet again.

643
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:42,640
Please change your name for a lifetime.
