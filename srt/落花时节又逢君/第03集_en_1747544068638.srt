1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm drunk.

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The name in the painting

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
is waiting for the time to meet again.

4
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
The third season of the Ninth Four Thousand Years of Heaven and Earth.

5
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The flower god Jinxiu and the palace maid Yuquan

6
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
are being checked by a 500-year-old little demon.

7
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm so tired.

8
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'm so tired.

9
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm so tired.

10
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm so tired.

11
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
It's already the middle of the night.

12
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I really want to know what's wrong with the god.

13
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I want to know too.

14
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'm the only witness of this silver poem.

15
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm still responsible for writing the real thing.

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You say...

17
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I haven't seen the autumn for so many years.

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm going to write it.

19
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
But the god is not used to

20
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
being cold and cold all the time.

21
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
He's not always cold.

22
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
When the god Kunlun was here,

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
he was so angry.

24
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
But this time, he was attacked by a red tea.

25
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He's showing his true self.

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The god was attacked by a red tea demon.

27
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I didn't say anything.

28
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
If I really write it,

29
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
the three realms will be in a real battle.

30
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Why do you have so many wounds?

31
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Does it hurt?

32
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Master, didn't you say last time

33
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
that the desserts at the flower show were not good?

34
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Recently, a new group of people came.

35
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I brought you the best desserts.

36
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Let's talk about it another day.

37
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The desserts are already set.

38
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,000
If you're late, it's a big trouble.

39
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Why don't you be so active?

40
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You...

41
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Forget it.

42
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Look.

43
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
There's another plate.

44
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Maybe it's a surprise.

45
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Leave it there.

46
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I'll leave now.

47
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Let's go.

48
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Master,

49
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
the person who made the desserts is waiting outside.

50
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Just pass it on.

51
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Pass it on.

52
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's you.

53
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I have something on my face.

54
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Why are you looking at me like that?

55
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
I didn't do anything that day.

56
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What are you doing?

57
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Master.

58
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Why are you doing this to me?

59
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You made this?

60
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I couldn't find you after you left.

61
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I even asked around. They didn't know where you were.

62
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Did you add any special spices?

63
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Special spices?

64
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You mean the endless mint?

65
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
My friend Jiao Bo gave it to me.

66
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Master, the Mint Clan is from Bai Zhou Mountain.

67
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The Mint Clan is from the South China Sea.

68
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Your friend Jiao Bo hasn't been to the fairyland for thousands of years.

69
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
So he hasn't seen you.

70
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
It's a demon.

71
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What's wrong with the demon? Is it good?

72
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
It tastes good. It's soft and tender.

73
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The cake is different.

74
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Of course. The one in Hua Zhao Palace is not good.

75
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What's your ingredient?

76
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I asked someone to find the old one.

77
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I found the fresh one.

78
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The flower thief?

79
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I haven't heard this word in hundreds of years.

80
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The old one.

81
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The flower thief.

82
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
The one from the horse.

83
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Take him away.

84
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Why are you leaving?

85
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Are you okay?

86
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Master.

87
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Don't be angry.

88
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
He's a demon.

89
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I don't think you should kill him.

90
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Master, you said he was rude.

91
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Why are you...

92
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
It's your fault. Where is his fairy talisman?

93
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm here.

94
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I've been writing poetry.

95
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He's been punished.

96
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Xu Xian Guan, say that again.

97
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Yes.

98
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Wait.

99
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Today's thing.

100
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Don't go out.

101
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Yes.

102
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Where are you going? It's raining heavily.

103
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Why is it raining so heavily?

104
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
It must be the god.

105
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Even the fairy said he hasn't seen Hua Zhao Palace rain so heavily.

106
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
He's really bad.

107
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I have to spoil him.

108
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I don't owe him.

109
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
You're here.

110
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
What's your name?

111
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You're the one.

112
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The one.

113
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
The one.

114
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You know who I am?

115
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I know.

116
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The one.

117
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Why are you so rude?

118
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Call me Xu Xian Guan.

119
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Xu Xian Guan.

120
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Look at you.

121
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Wait.

122
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I think you should wear a little thicker.

123
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
This will make you look more like a woman.

124
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Didn't we agree that we would change our clothes every three days?

125
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Three times a day.

126
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Don't die.

127
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Don't scare me.

128
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
You scared me.

129
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't want to be a woman.

130
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I can't do it.

131
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I can't do it.

132
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I have to take responsibility if you die.

133
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
I can do it.

134
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You're stronger than me.

135
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
I'm stronger.

136
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Don't do this.

137
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You're too cruel.

138
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'll make you go to hell.

139
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You'll be punished.

140
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
No.

141
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
I can't do it.

142
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
I can do anything.

143
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I'm going to the painting show.

144
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Painting show?

145
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,000
You're a little monster.

146
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You're not satisfied?

147
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm tired.

148
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I want to keep you.

149
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,000
I don't think it's too late for you to go.

150
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You can do it.

151
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You're the only one who can do it.

152
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I can do it.

153
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,000
I can do it.

154
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
You can do it.

155
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You can do it.

156
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
The flowers are all from that person.

157
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
That person?

158
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Continue.

159
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You can do it.

160
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
You can do it.

161
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You can do it.

162
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
You're all representatives of the flower tribe.

163
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
You need to give flowers to the flower god.

164
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
If the flowers bloom well, you can enter the flower god's temple.

165
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,000
You can continue to practice in the heaven.

166
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You can take care of your flowers here.

167
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Follow the flower god's etiquette.

168
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
You can go to the flower place.

169
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You're a fairy.

170
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Why are you here?

171
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm here to see you.

172
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,000
What did you say?

173
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I want to take the flower god's flower.

174
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You're so ignorant.

175
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You're a little monster.

176
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You want the flower god's flower?

177
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I can do anything.

178
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Stop dreaming.

179
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You're here to take the flower god's flower?

180
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You're here to take the flower god's flower?

181
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I...

182
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,000
You're here because you don't have a reason?

183
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Since you have the courage to ask me, I won't make it difficult for you.

184
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm a fan of the flower tribe.

185
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
The flower has fallen.

186
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,000
If you're here, it's not a good thing.

187
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
So I can get the flower god's flower?

188
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Thank you.

189
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,000
The flower tribe has a lot more flowers than before.

190
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The flower forest is crowded.

191
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,000
You're the last flower god's flower.

192
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Follow me.

193
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,000
This is a big place.

194
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Your flower is here.

195
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I just need to plant it here?

196
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Yes.

197
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
But if the flower is not blooming,

198
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
you won't be able to attend the flower festival.

199
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
The palace is too small.

200
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Not only the inside, but also the outside.

201
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Don't worry. I can plant the flower.

202
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
How can the god's flower let you stay?

203
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm sorry.

204
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Don't be like this.

205
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
It's just a flower.

206
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Look at the ground.

207
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Who's picking the grass?

208
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Be careful.

209
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's hard to pick.

210
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
It's not grass.

211
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
It's a kind of spirit.

212
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
It was given to the god.

213
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
But it's not good.

214
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
It can eat other flowers.

215
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
So you have to remove all the plants.

216
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,000
It can't plant the flower.

217
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'll just remove them.

218
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
You're stupid.

219
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,000
It's wild.

220
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,000
I'll help you.

221
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
You said it's wild.

222
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Be careful.

223
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Be careful.

224
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,000
I'm done.

225
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
It's me.

226
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Stop playing.

227
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
I'm picking the grass.

228
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
You're not playing.

229
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's much better.

230
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Try it.

231
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm done.

232
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,000
I'm done.

233
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
I'm done.

234
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,000
I'm done.

235
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,000
I'm done.

236
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm done.

237
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
I'm done.

238
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
I'm done.

239
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,000
When can the god be gone?

240
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm done.

241
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
The one who was locked in the Water Moon Mirror is troublesome.

242
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Now you're in the water.

243
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
There's a man in the water.

244
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
It rained on the day he left.

245
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
It rained.

246
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Let me tell you.

247
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Many years ago, the god's brother Kunlun Jun

248
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
broke the ice and destroyed the sacred place Cang Wu Mountain.

249
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Mr. Mei.

250
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Mr. Mei.

251
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
The god's power trapped him in the Water Moon Mirror.

252
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
Kunlun Jun.

253
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,000
The flower god's brother has made a lot of flowers.

254
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,000
He asked me to bring them here for you to try.

255
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,000
It's boring.

256
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
The flower god has made over 1,400 kinds of flowers.

257
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
But he only brought one kind.

258
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
If you don't want to try, don't regret it.

259
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Don't regret it.

260
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
What's this smell? I've never tasted it.

261
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
I heard it's made of mint.

262
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Mint? What's mint?

263
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
I'm not sure. I'll leave now.

264
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Sister Mei.

265
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Why is my brother not visiting me?

266
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
The painting exhibition is coming. Please forgive me.

267
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
It's okay. You're here to see me.

268
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I'm happy too.

269
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
I'll leave now.

270
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Sister Mei.

271
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
The flower god has made over 1,400 kinds of flowers.

273
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
He asked me to bring them here for you to try.

274
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
He asked me to bring them here for you to try.

275
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
I'm not sure.

276
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm not sure.

277
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
How many petals did you count?

278
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
250.

279
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I usually sleep at 300 degrees.

280
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,000
I slept at 250 today.

281
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
It's boring.

282
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:08,000
I don't want to scare you.

283
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Straighten your body.

284
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Okay.

285
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
You look like 250.

286
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
I've been counting for more than 10 days.

287
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
How many times do you want me to be locked up?

288
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It depends on your mood.

289
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You can't be locked up for thousands of years.

290
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
You can't be locked up for thousands of years.

291
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,000
I'll wait until you get a star.

292
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I think you haven't improved at all.

293
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
If you don't have my permission, you can't touch my flowers.

294
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Okay.

295
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:00,000
If I don't touch it, feed me.

296
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,000
I'm sorry.

297
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,000
You can't kill me with one sip.

298
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
If you really want to drink, come out from the flower field.

299
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Come out from the flower field.

300
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,640
I finally found a way for you.

301
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,240
I can count, right?

302
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,080
Greetings, Master.

303
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,880
The doctor asked you to go to the court.

304
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,400
I see.

305
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,360
Walking hand in hand whenever he needs.

306
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,000
No!

307
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,200
No.

308
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,240
No.

309
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:26,680
Stop.

310
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,640
Your Excellency.

311
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,160
Why would the prince of the Northern Immortal Realm

312
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,120
be among the criminals?

313
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,760
This was ordered by Lord Bejie himself.

314
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,200
He said he gave him a thousand years of chance

315
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,640
but he failed to find the nine tails.

316
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,120
Lord Bejie was worried that this matter would be spread

317
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,440
and he would lose the dignity of the royal family

318
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,480
and sent it here.

319
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,600
The punishment is to execute the heavenly law.

320
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,720
He was born with three tails.

321
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,720
He didn't violate the heavenly law.

322
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,800
He shouldn't be punished.

323
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,520
Let him go.

324
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,240
But Lord Bejie...

325
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,360
I said let him go.

326
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,360
Yes.

327
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,200
Let him go.

328
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,400
Why didn't you leave?

329
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,320
Why did you save me?

330
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,920
I was just giving you the imperial edict.

331
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,240
You shouldn't have been tortured.

332
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,200
I was born with three tails.

333
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,760
Everyone hates me.

334
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:29,600
They hate me.

335
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,000
No one has ever

336
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,400
told me the truth.

337
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,880
Three tails and nine tails.

338
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,400
But the moral code is deep.

339
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:38,880
What's wrong with that?

340
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,800
They hate you and hate you.

341
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:42,680
It's also someone else's business.

342
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,600
How is that your business?

343
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,520
I didn't do it.

344
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,400
There's justice in the world.

345
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,800
Go and practice.

346
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,560
If there's an opportunity,

347
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,760
we'll meet.

348
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,680
Where can I go?

349
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,240
It's just like that,

350
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,640
not at all.

351
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,200
It's near here.

352
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,240
That's why it's been so long.

353
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,160
When the truth is known,

354
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,680
gold is only a personal possession.

355
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,520
A third of things

356
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,360
are shot down by the other.

357
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,720
Where do I keep my stuff?

358
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,280
Take a look.

359
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:53,800
It's okay, wait here.

360
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,560
Congratulations, Lord Nocturnal-elf!

361
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,560
Congratulations, Lord Nocturnal-elf!

362
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,560
Congratulations, Lord Nocturnal-elf!

363
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:04,560
After a thousand years,

364
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,560
the Golden Lotus has been taken by the Heavenly Pool again.

365
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,560
With this urgent call from the Northern Immortal Realm,

366
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,560
we will surely be able to start a great event.

367
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,560
It's been tens of thousands of years.

368
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,560
I have been waiting for this moment.

369
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,560
I have been waiting for this moment.

370
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,560
It's been tens of thousands of years.

371
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,560
The Northern Immortal Realm has been

372
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,560
under a lot of pressure.

373
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,560
The Four Seas have been invading us for decades.

374
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,560
Fortunately, I

375
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,560
and everyone

376
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,560
and the most precious

377
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,560
and most precious thing in the Four Seas,

378
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,560
the Eight Deserts,

379
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,560
are in contact with each other.

380
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,560
Yao.

381
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,560
Father.

382
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,560
The Northern Immortal Realm

383
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:54,560
is your only child.

384
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,560
From now on,

385
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,560
you must take on the responsibility

386
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,560
of the new king

387
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,560
of the Northern Immortal Realm for me.

388
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,560
I will do my best.

389
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,560
Yao.

390
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
If you can marry Lord Zhong Tian,

391
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,560
I will give you

392
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:24,560
this Golden Lotus Robe as your dowry.

393
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,560
Father.

394
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,560
But this Golden Lotus Robe is so precious.

395
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,560
Zhong Tian has been coveting my Golden Lotus Robe for a long time.

396
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,560
Now, the Northern Immortal Realm

397
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,560
can only rely on Zhong Tian's power

398
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,560
to keep it.

399
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,560
If you can really become the queen of Zhong Tian,

400
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,560
the Northern Immortal Realm

401
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,560
will be safe and sound.

402
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,560
Yes, father.

403
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,560
How is A'Jiu doing lately?

404
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,560
He went to the lower realms to practice.

405
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,560
That's good.

406
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:07,560
He will be more at ease there.

407
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,560
Heavenly Maid,

408
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,560
Lu Jiu was born as a three-dimensional being,

409
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,560
like a demon who is a demon.

410
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:17,560
The king has the opportunity to mention this.

411
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,560
You'd better not mention it in front of him.

412
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,560
I know.

413
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,560
Heavenly Maid.

414
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,560
Heavenly Maid.

415
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,560
Come with me.

416
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,560
The senior flower fairy who will be our cultivator is here.

417
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Coming.

418
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,560
Hurry up.

419
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,560
Let's go.

420
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,560
Let's go.

421
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,560
Baochuan, Shaoyao, Furong,

422
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:09,560
follow the fairy Baihe.

423
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,560
Fairy Baihe.

424
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,560
Fairy,

425
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,560
you have to take care of the new fairy,

426
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,560
her posture and the foundation of cultivation.

427
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,560
What about Hongning?

428
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,560
Shaoyao,

429
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,560
just do as I told you.

430
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,560
Yes.

431
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,560
Red tea demon,

432
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,560
you are a demon,

433
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,560
you can't follow our fairy.

434
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:42,560
Learn from this side.

435
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,560
What's wrong with me being a demon?

436
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,560
The fairy is great.

437
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,560
Hush.

438
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,560
Be careful.

439
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,560
Hold the pen firmly.

440
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,560
Draw the eyebrows fine.

441
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,560
Bow.

442
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,560
Vaginal.

443
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,560
The voice should come out from the abdomen.

444
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,560
The gentleman is blue.

445
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,560
The gentleman is blue.

446
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,560
The broad-eyed is blue.

447
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,560
The broad-eyed is blue.

448
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
The broad-eyed is blue.

449
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:51,560
The broad-eyed is blue.

450
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,560
The broad-eyed is blue.

451
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,560
The broad-eyed is blue.

452
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
The broad-eyed is blue.

453
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,560
Water flowers.

454
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,560
Water flowers.

455
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,560
Jasmine flowers.

456
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,560
Jasmine flowers.

457
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:02,560
That's all for today.

458
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,560
After you go back,

459
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,560
you have to practice hard.

460
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,560
The new fairy will test you one by one.

461
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,560
Yes.

462
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,560
Yes.

463
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,560
Hongning,

464
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,560
are you tired?

465
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,560
No.

466
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,560
Two plum blossoms, three lotus flowers.

467
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,560
Four seasons of peach blossoms, four seasons of flowers.

468
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,560
Five-moon plum blossoms, five-color flowers.

469
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,560
Six-moon snow blooms, white flowers.

470
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,560
Who is making noise here?

471
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,560
Fairy, it's you.

472
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,560
Why are you still here?

473
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,560
I'm going to stay and attend the flower exhibition.

474
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,560
This is the flower ring I just got.

475
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,560
Is it from the fairy?

476
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:54,560
Yes.

477
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
Who taught you to talk like that?

478
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,560
Isn't this the formal pronunciation

479
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:02,560
of the flowering festival?

480
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,560
I just learned it.

481
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,560
With whom?

482
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,560
They are teaching over there.

483
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,560
I learned it secretly next to them.

484
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,560
Don't move.

485
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,560
Go wash your eyebrows.

486
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,560
No need.

487
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:25,560
I'll wash them myself later.

488
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,560
Thank you.

489
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,560
Your clothes don't fit.

490
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,560
So awesome.

491
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,560
I'm so happy.

492
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:45,560
I'm so happy.

493
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,560
So awesome.

494
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:50,560
Come with me.

495
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,560
Coming.

496
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,560
This way.

497
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,560
This way?

498
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,560
Come a little bit more.

499
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,560
Okay.

500
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,560
Xu Xiangguan, what are you doing there?

501
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:08,560
I...

502
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,560
I was on my way to the lotus flower.

503
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,560
I forgot to turn it off.

504
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,560
I'm going back now.

505
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,560
Stop.

506
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,560
Where did you take her to?

507
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,560
Master,

508
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,560
she doesn't even know how to use the thunder.

509
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,560
Who does she think she is?

510
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,560
Don't let me see you again.

511
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,560
I'm going.

512
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,560
Be careful.

513
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,560
Don't fall.

514
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,560
Okay.

515
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,560
I'm done.

516
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,560
Why can't you even draw eyebrows?

517
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,560
I don't have the talent.

518
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:55,560
We didn't draw this before.

519
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,560
Give it to me.

520
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,560
The wind blows, the rain falls.

521
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,560
Don't move.

522
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,560
I'm going.

523
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,560
I'm going.

524
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,560
I'm going.

525
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,560
I'm going.

526
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,560
I'm going.

527
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,560
Don't move.

528
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,560
The spring breeze blows, the flowers fall.

529
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,560
I feel sad.

530
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,560
I don't want to lose you.

531
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:55,560
I'm going to forget you.

532
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,560
I only wish to be with you.

533
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,560
I...

534
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,560
I just feel a little bit nervous.

535
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,560
You have a new trick.

536
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,560
You know medical skills?

537
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,560
I know a little.

538
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,560
Then help me see.

539
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,560
The dream is like a dream.

540
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:50,560
What's the point of having to exchange our love?

541
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,560
The journey is long.

542
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:55,560
The past has gone with the wind.

543
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:02,560
But when we meet,

544
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:08,560
we grow old together.

545
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:12,560
I only wish to be with you.

546
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,560
I only wish to be with you.

547
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:21,560
I only wish to be with you.

548
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,560
The world is falling apart.

549
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:34,560
We meet again.

550
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:41,560
Please change your name for a lifetime.

551
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:47,560
Do you still remember where you were happy?

552
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,560
When the flowers bloom,

553
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,560
the eyes in my heart

554
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:00,560
will accompany you to forget the world and the wind and rain.

555
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:07,560
Please change your name for a lifetime.

556
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:13,560
Do you still remember where you were happy?

557
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,560
When the flowers bloom,

558
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:20,560
the eyes in my heart

559
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:26,560
will accompany you to forget the world and the wind and rain.

560
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:33,560
I only wish to be with you.

561
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:39,560
I only wish to be with you.

562
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,560
