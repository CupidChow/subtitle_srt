00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:54,720
Now the

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,120
When ITell The work....

3
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,800
The current story in this episode is also quite delicious.

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,140
There's an olfactory qianqiao Very soft and

5
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,440
Is this your horse maintains his horse

6
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,600
What the hell is that

7
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,620
For me

8
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:33,860
Eternal Love of fáce

00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:42,400
Park Walking

只待囉哇同向回

13
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,620
I don't know what's going on with Bai Buqu.

14
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:03,020
But he's a supplementary.

15
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,620
He should be completing the task in front of me.

16
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,620
Right?

17
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,620
Master.

18
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:30,620
Master.

19
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,620
Where's Hongning?

20
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,620
udent

21
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,620
Help.

22
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,120
Help.

23
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,380
Stop!

24
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,940
My Flaming Formation

25
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,740
can last for at least an hour.

26
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,980
I didn't expect it to last that long.

27
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:35,860
Nonsense!

28
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,580
Bai Ling,

29
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,180
how dare you!

30
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,300
If something happens to Hu Nian,

31
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,900
I won't spare you.

32
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,620
Master, you're so fierce.

33
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,300
How dare you treat your junior like that?

34
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,620
He's not a junior yet.

35
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,980
You're still arguing.

36
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,020
You still don't know what to do.

37
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,940
I was left alone in the woods when I was a kid.

38
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,380
You didn't look for me in such a hurry.

39
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,700
Do you know that

40
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,660
every time you spent the night in the back hill,

41
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,300
Master was always behind you?

42
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,620
How... How is that possible?

43
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,660
Do you really think we'll leave you there?

44
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,100
Who is it?

45
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,820
Go find him first.

46
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,500
You'd better pray that Hong Ning is fine.

47
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:36,420
What's going on?

48
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,540
Such a strong demon aura.

49
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,260
The back hill.

50
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,660
Help!

51
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,660
Help!

52
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:00,740
Master!

53
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,540
Help!

54
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,420
I didn't expect to meet you here.

55
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,580
You... Who are you?

56
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,900
You'd better stay away from me.

57
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,140
Be careful that I can't see you.

58
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:17,060
I'm here.

59
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,060
I'm here.

60
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:19,020
I'm here.

61
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,100
I'm here.

62
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,140
I'm here.

63
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,260
I'm here.

64
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,380
I'm here.

65
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
I'm here.

66
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,700
Please, I'll take you in.

67
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,580
Take me in?

68
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,740
That's what I want to do.

69
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,540
I'm your nemesis.

70
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:36,700
Your little trick

71
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,500
can't defeat me.

72
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,300
Hong Ning.

73
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,500
How do you know my name?

74
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,700
Hong Ning!

75
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,460
Hong Ning!

76
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,780
Hong Ning!

77
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,740
It's all my fault.

78
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,180
I shouldn't have left her alone.

79
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,940
You're the most annoying person.

80
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,300
You're a traitor and you're still keeping secrets.

81
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,340
I'll deal with you the moment I find Hong Ning.

82
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:00,820
I...

83
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,580
Shut up.

84
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,140
Hong Ning!

85
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,660
Stop searching.

86
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,380
There's a mark left by Master.

87
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,340
Follow up.

88
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:12,980
Hong Ning!

89
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,820
Master!

90
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,580
Hong Ning!

91
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,820
Hong Ning!

92
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,220
Master!

93
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,420
Hong Ning!

94
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,380
Master!

95
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,660
Yourated Ghost Master.

96
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:31,820
Amazing.

97
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,180
Stop下去.

98
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,060
Good job.

99
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,500
Now,

100
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,540
I've got you.

101
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,660
You caught me back quindly.

102
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,460
Be careful.

103
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,760
OK.

104
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,040
I like all kinds of flowers.

105
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,920
But I hate flowers.

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,240
Maybe we were enemies

107
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,760
in the past life.

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,920
It's you.

109
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,400
You, the little red tea monster in the enemy's palace.

110
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,800
You made me make mistakes step by step.

111
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,480
You made me lose myself step by step.

112
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,520
It's you.

113
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,680
You made me lose my past.

114
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,320
You made me become like this.

115
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,160
You made me become like this.

116
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,480
Although I don't know what you're talking about,

117
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,040
I only know that

118
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,440
if a person

119
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,880
thinks that it's others' fault,

120
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,560
he must have a problem.

121
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,600
You're still

122
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,520
stubborn.

123
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,080
Let's see how long you can be arrogant.

124
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,720
Immortal Brother.

125
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,600
Your Grace.

126
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,240
Long time no see.

127
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,040
Xinxin.

128
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,760
You violated the heaven rule

129
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,680
and were punished to go to the lower realm to re-train.

130
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:29,400
Why are you still stubborn

131
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,600
and not repenting?

132
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,960
Xinxin.

133
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,160
Your Grace.

134
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,800
You haven't called me like this

135
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,320
for a long time.

136
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,920
You're trying to hurt the innocent mortal

137
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,560
and commit many evils.

138
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,280
You should go back to Cangwu dungeon with me

139
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,280
and punish him

140
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:51,760
after the immortal goes to the lower realm.

141
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,840
Mortal?

142
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,520
How could he be an innocent mortal?

143
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,200
If it wasn't for him,

144
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,880
how could I be here?

145
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,440
I was a small flower in the wild.

146
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,280
I'm the son of the God of Heaven

147
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,440
who always respects you.

148
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,880
So I'm so attached to the immortal.

149
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,000
That's why I've worked so hard

150
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,360
to become a flower fairy.

151
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,800
In the Hua Zhao Palace,

152
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,360
I've been thinking for you

153
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,760
and trying my best.

154
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,320
But in your eyes,

155
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,040
I'm nothing.

156
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,960
He's just a demon.

157
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,800
But you see him as a treasure.

158
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,120
You can't compare him to a demon.

159
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,080
You can't make him like proposals.

160
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,680
Here,

161
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,000
I'll protect you

162
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,840
till the very end.

163
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,520
What if he has to die?

164
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,200
His gravity will lose him

165
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,360
on the sublimity.

166
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,080
Late immortals

167
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,080
lose their cycle of life.

168
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,240
If he is still alive,

169
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,720
Come on, taste it.

170
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,700
Thank you, Directoruma.

171
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,240
Master Shen Zun,

172
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:51,240
I will die because of you.

173
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,240
Will I become your demon?

174
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,240
Master Shen Zun,

175
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,240
I can finally

176
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,240
say goodbye to you.

177
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,240
Then,

178
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,240
I will die.

179
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,240
I will die.

180
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,240
Feng Ning, Feng Ning.

181
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
Master.

182
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
Master.

183
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,240
Feng Ning.

184
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,240
He is getting weaker.

185
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,240
I'm afraid he can't hold the coldness of the Golden Wheel.

186
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
Feng Ning.

187
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,240
I will take the punishment.

188
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,280
andesa

189
00:15:45,460 --> 00:16:07,120
Mang

190
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,400
Ba germ depict

191
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,400
Why are you bleeding?

192
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,400
Master, you healed me.

193
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,400
Are you hurt?

194
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,400
I'm fine.

195
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,400
It's fine.

196
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,400
Rest well.

197
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
Thank you, Master.

198
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:41,400
Thank you.

199
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:45,400
Where she is grill

200
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,360
Government is serving.

201
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,860
Your Highness, I'm sorry.

202
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,100
Did I really have to apologize to him?

203
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,100
Since I'm sorry,

204
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,220
I'm not responsible for my ownabyte.

205
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,640
If I don't apologize,

206
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,680
my Lord is sure to curse me.

207
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,920
It is my fault after all.

208
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,120
Master.

209
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,280
Master.

210
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,880
Here is the scenery.

211
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,800
Actually,

212
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,360
I just woke up.

213
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:01,680
You already were, right?

214
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:05,400
That can be great.

215
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,240
Right, that can be great.

216
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,560
What do you have in your hand?

217
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,520
Ah! It is

218
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,160
this,

219
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,400
I'm afraid that Tian Nanxin will ask me to send some food to Hongning.

220
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,200
Ask you?

221
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,200
Why don't they come here themselves?

222
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,920
They think that Hongning is hurt.

223
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,200
So they are embarrassed to come here.

224
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,120
They feel embarrassed?

225
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,800
Or you feel embarrassed to let her get hurt?

226
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,240
I'm sorry, Master.

227
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,000
I was wrong.

228
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,120
Let's go.

229
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,240
Let's go together.

230
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:41,920
Give it to me.

231
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,040
No need, Master.

232
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:46,440
How can I bother you with such a small thing?

233
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,520
I made a mistake.

234
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,280
I'll apologize to her myself.

235
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:48,880
Let's go.

236
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,920
I'll watch you apologize.

237
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,400
Master.

238
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,040
There's really no need.

239
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,720
Let go.

240
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,080
What's wrong, Master?

241
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,840
Go by yourself.

242
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:15,960
Apologize properly.

243
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:17,760
Yes.

244
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,440
Was the immortal

245
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,400
Master?

246
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,440
I'm sorry, Hongning.

247
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,640
It's my fault this time.

248
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,120
I hope you have a lot of people.

249
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,360
You can be a ship in the Zaixiangdu.

250
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,080
There are many ships in the sea.

251
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:06,880
Focus.

252
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,000
I hope you can forgive me.

253
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,120
No.

254
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,360
Senior Bai Ling just gave me advice.

255
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,040
I'm not good enough.

256
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,000
That's why everyone is worried about me.

257
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:21,880
Bai Ling.

258
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,960
You are arrogant.

259
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,840
You almost hurt your fellow disciples.

260
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,840
You will be punished to go to the back hill to face the wall.

261
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,520
You will be punished for a hundred times.

262
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,240
You are not punished.

263
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
You are not allowed to go down the hill.

264
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,120
Yes.

265
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,280
Bai Ling.

266
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,160
Master gave the order

267
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,560
because he was afraid that the unskilled disciples would take the risk.

268
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,640
You gave him the order.

269
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,480
Everyone knows that the master gave him the grace.

270
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,360
He asked us to pick the key in the back hill

271
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,920
and make it carefully.

272
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,960
I just want to tease him.

273
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:50,920
You...

274
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,360
And you, Hongning.

275
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:57,000
You agreed to this request without thinking.

276
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,160
You overestimated yourself.

277
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,480
That's why you hurt yourself.

278
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,440
Many fellow disciples are in danger.

279
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,680
I punish you to go down the hill immediately.

280
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,120
You are not allowed to step into the warehouse.

281
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,520
I...

282
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:11,720
Well...

283
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,120
Master.

284
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,640
Although Hongning is good at going to the back hill,

285
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,800
he is very affectionate.

286
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,520
That demon is very powerful.

287
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,680
It's normal that Hongning can't subdue him.

288
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,560
Besides, he treats our fellow disciples well.

289
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:24,240
Yes.

290
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,160
Master.

291
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,640
Please don't let him go.

292
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:27,960
No need to say more.

293
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,240
The rules of Cangwu Mountain can't be changed.

294
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,200
Master.

295
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,280
As long as I complete one of the three rewards,

296
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,560
can I not go?

297
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,560
Of course.

298
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,120
Do you think you are 먹어버퍼리?

299
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,880
I don't think this supper is suitable for Jiotto.

300
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,120
No.

301
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,320
It's better for the optimization.

302
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,120
Master.

303
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,880
Do you mean...

304
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,440
Master.

305
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,520
Most管 Tails' power

306
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,160
will be completely lost.

307
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,120
That's right, Master.

308
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,120
You...

309
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,040
You too?

310
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:00,840
Great.

311
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,280
You are indeed to enter the Crane Ocean at once.

312
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:05,800
He is late.

313
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,160
Can we change the power?

314
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,120
No need.

315
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,440
We can go first.

316
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,000
Good musical cooperation.

317
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,400
Master, you don't even agree to this.

318
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,200
I feel embarrassed for you.

319
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,000
Right?

320
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,760
Master, please accept Hong Yun as your disciple.

321
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,280
Forget it.

322
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,800
Hong Ning,

323
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
from today on,

324
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,040
you will be a formal disciple of Cangwu Academy.

325
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,480
I hope you will practice hard

326
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,400
and remember the rules of Cangwu.

327
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,080
Otherwise, you will no longer be a disciple.

328
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,280
Thank you, Master.

329
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,680
Thank you, Master.

330
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,320
Here we go again.

331
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,680
Master.

332
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,360
He stayed.

333
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,800
And he became a formal disciple.

334
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,160
But this is not my problem.

335
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,200
But it's good.

336
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,240
I can protect him better.

337
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,120
Master, don't interrupt me.

338
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,360
I mean this.

339
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,080
Master, you...

340
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,640
I...

341
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,200
I...

342
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:40,600
Behave and 봉因

343
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,760
Master, it's the ninth level in this Flora...

344
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:31,280
Dateウ

345
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,120
Why does he not look at me

346
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,040
I've been being careless lately.

347
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,600
I was hurt by my attitude.

348
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,480
The Lemon Crystal.

349
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,680
What are you doing here?

350
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,720
I just want to go in and have a look.

351
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,800
Move aside.

352
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,800
Aren't you afraid of hurting yourself?

353
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,400
What are you looking at?

354
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,880
You're not allowed to go in and have a look.

355
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,160
I...

356
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,200
What's inside?

357
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,120
Senior Bai Ling, let me in.

358
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,920
Does anyone know the effect of the earth grass?

359
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,640
Earth grass is a very special plant.

360
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,520
It can absorb people's energy and spiritual power.

361
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,920
Wait a minute.

362
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,520
Wait a minute, seniors.

363
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,720
I'll take it off in a minute.

364
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,200
What are you asking us to do?

365
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,320
Let me help you.

366
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,160
No, no, no.

367
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,120
Senior, I'll take it off in a minute.

368
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,840
You're still shy?

369
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,920
Aren't you arguing about practicing the real thing?

370
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,840
I won't argue. I'll go by myself.

371
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,240
What's this attitude?

372
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:24,320
Yes, yes, yes.

373
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,160
This is it.

374
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,640
The lemon crystal is very sour.

375
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,880
Lemon crystal, come out quickly.

376
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,200
Lemon crystal.

377
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,240
Come out quickly.

378
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,800
Lemon crystal.

379
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,720
What are you doing?

380
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,800
Master, why are you here?

381
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,560
Where are my clothes?

382
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,560
Junior, let's go.

383
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,520
Come home quickly.

384
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,520
No, my clothes...

385
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,920
I'm so unlucky.

386
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,200
Anything can happen.

387
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,480
Junior, what are you doing?

388
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,040
Why do you want to take Bai Ling's clothes?

389
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,240
I...

390
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,200
The clothes are there.

391
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,320
I was afraid that she would lose them.

392
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,280
So I brought them here.

393
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,520
You've been looking forward to it since you were little.

394
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,920
You've been holding the clothes here all the way.

395
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,920
You're afraid that she'll lose them.

396
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,040
Then,

397
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,840
she can't lose them here, right?

398
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,040
Why are you staring at Bai Ling?

399
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,800
I'm not.

400
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:19,520
Why?

401
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,720
So fierce.

402
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,640
I...

403
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,040
You...

404
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,120
Fine.

405
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,880
I can't say it.

406
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,880
Because this is a taboo in Cangwu Mountain.

407
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,280
Does she like Bai Ling?

408
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,480
If you can't focus on your cultivation,

409
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,920
I'll take your status as an apprentice.

410
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,880
No, I...

411
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,800
I'm not not focused on cultivation.

412
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,400
I'm looking for the lemon crystal.

413
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,720
Why is my heart beating so fast?

414
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,720
Does she like Kunlun in this life?

415
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
What should I do?

416
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,440
The seven dusts are sweet.

417
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,600
Master.

418
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,200
Left.

419
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:20,920
Right.

420
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:22,800
Up.

421
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,080
Master, look.

422
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,680
Bai Ling has been so confused recently.

423
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,600
Could it be

424
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,080
that she's really in love with him?

425
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,200
Please.

426
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,240
There's no girl

427
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,640
in this mountain.

428
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,680
Where did this love come from?

429
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,280
There's no girl in the mountain.

430
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,720
There's no girl

431
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,280
in the mountain.

432
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,280
Who told you that?

433
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:49,960
Right.

434
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,240
I also found that

435
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,440
the junior disciples

436
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,480
are talking about this.

437
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,600
Come.

438
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,000
Look.

439
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,320
What's wrong with Hong Ning?

440
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,440
Look.

441
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,280
Last time, when she came back from the mountain,

442
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:07,480
Hong Ning also became

443
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,520
this kind of hand-pulled girl.

444
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,680
Master.

445
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,800
Where did she hide the lemon crystal?

446
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,040
So,

447
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,920
we must

448
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,720
protect them.

449
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:37,840
Right.

450
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,800
Practice the bow and arrow.

451
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,800
Practice the bow and arrow.

452
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,240
How can I make that little fox

453
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,480
live so hard?

454
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,480
Who did she offend?

455
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,640
I'll ask her directly.

456
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Will she say it?

457
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,120
The lemon crystal still

458
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,360
has no whereabouts.

459
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,360
Master is so weird.

460
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,680
When can I

461
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,200
go down the mountain?

462
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,200
Hong Ning.

463
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,840
If there's anything

464
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,240
that's inconvenient for you to say,

465
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,840
you can ask the Heavenly Maid.

466
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,440
Heavenly Maid?

467
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,480
That's right.

468
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,720
There's a Heavenly Maid Temple

469
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,120
in the middle of the mountain.

470
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,480
According to the senior disciples,

471
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,520
it's a place

472
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,120
where the Heavenly Maid

473
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,400
is very special.

474
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,280
Why don't you try it?

475
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,240
Bai Ling.

476
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,920
What's up, Master?

477
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,440
How many times

478
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:45,440
is there a hundred times of the temple?

479
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,000
Ninety-nine times.

480
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,080
There's no temple

481
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,960
on the back mountain.

482
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:55,440
That's right.

483
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:57,160
Oh, right.

484
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:58,680
There's a Heavenly Maid Temple

485
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,680
in the middle of the mountain.

486
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,440
It seems to be

487
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,280
damaged by your fox senior.

488
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,000
Do you want to go to the temple?

489
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,760
No, I don't want to go.

490
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,600
I fought with the fox senior last time.

491
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,960
He's been in my place for half a month.

492
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,960
Who told you

493
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,520
to fight with your fox senior?

494
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,880
I told you to go to the Heavenly Maid Temple.

495
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,680
The Heavenly Maid Temple?

496
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:24,880
Yes.

497
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,880
Thanks God for this temple.

498
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,800
Heavenly Maid, please bless me.

499
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:46,420
Heavenly Maid

500
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,400
must bless me.

501
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,200
Heavenly Maid.

502
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,520
Heavenly Maid, please bless me.

503
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,240
Please bless me.

504
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,840
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

505
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,320
I'm going to get a test too.

506
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,400
You?

507
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,640
Please don't cause trouble for the Heavenly Maid.

508
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,560
Right?

509
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,440
You know,

510
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,840
it's useless to learn

511
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,000
and worship the gods at critical moments.

512
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:10,920
What are you doing here?

513
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,320
Well...

514
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,120
Let me guess.

515
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,080
You must be tired recently.

516
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,720
I'm here to make a good luck charm.

517
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:22,920
Do you need help?

518
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,120
Okay.

519
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:26,920
You want to build a temple?

520
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,840
You have a good idea.

521
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,080
But the temple is badly damaged.

522
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,800
You need to repair it.

523
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,280
Right.

524
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,480
Mr. Fox is too stubborn.

525
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,640
As far as I know,

526
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:43,280
Mr. Fox passed by the temple by accident.

527
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,520
He didn't even enter the temple.

528
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,200
He just pushed the three-dimensional fire

529
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,440
and burned the whole temple.

530
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,240
Thanks to Master.

531
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,280
I also heard that

532
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,120
the Heavenly Maid of the mountain

533
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,320
knew about this

534
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,280
and asked us to discuss it.

535
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,440
It's so serious.

536
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,000
Mr. Fox

537
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,400
never passed by this road

538
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,000
after he went up and down the mountain.

539
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,480
So Mr. Fox

540
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,720
used to be so arrogant.

541
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,360
No, no, no.

542
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,240
You can repair it yourself.

543
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,040
I'm leaving.

544
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:13,840
Okay, Mr. Fox.

545
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,960
Senior.

546
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,440
Hongning.

547
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,080
You...

548
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,360
You're here to build a temple?

549
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:34,400
Yes.

550
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,480
They said

551
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,000
the temple is very spiritual.

552
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,160
You're alone?

553
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,960
It's okay.

554
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,080
I can understand.

555
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,880
I can understand.

556
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:48,160
I won't say anything.

557
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,040
I won't say anything.

558
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:54,880
Your Highness.

559
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,280
I heard that you're very spiritual.

560
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,880
I wonder if you can

561
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:00,360
help me solve the problem.

562
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,120
Actually, it's nothing.

563
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,520
Just a while ago,

564
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,040
I found a little fox.

565
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,960
It's so beautiful.

566
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,960
It's so beautiful.

567
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,840
It's so beautiful.

568
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,720
It's so beautiful.

569
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,680
It's so beautiful.

570
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,760
It's so beautiful.

571
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,720
It's so beautiful.

572
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,440
No.

573
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,880
Am I alive?

574
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,760
The Heavenly Maid

575
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:29,800
looks a little like a little fox.

576
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,040
She does look a little like a little fox.

577
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,720
You two are definitely not meant to be.

578
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,320
You must be.

579
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,600
Senior Bai Ling.

580
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,240
Junior.

581
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,640
Why are you here?

582
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,240
You mean the kind of person

583
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,480
who is happy when he sees her

584
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,720
and misses her when he can't see her

585
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,360
and is unwilling to admit it?

586
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,600
Yes.

587
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,600
How do you know?

588
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,840
Junior.

589
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,280
I've been sick for a long time.

590
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,320
I'm sick and I'm sick. Junior.

591
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,800
I understand.

592
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,360
But Junior.

593
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:21,400
But she's leaving.

594
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,080
I'm not well yet. What should I do?

595
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,120
If she's leaving,

596
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,720
you should keep her.

597
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,320
Keep her?

598
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,560
Keep her?

599
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,080
What's going on

600
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,200
between Bai Ling and Hong Ning?

601
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,200
I saw them

602
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,480
being close

603
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,400
and went to the Heavenly Maid Temple together.

604
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,680
Who is spreading this

605
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,880
and is being punished?

606
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,920
Yes.

607
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,880
Nonsense.

608
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,640
She doesn't practice well every day

609
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:04,640
and does this.

610
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,320
She's always causing trouble in the Heaven Realm.

611
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,960
She's still like this in the lower realms.

612
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,360
She doesn't care about me at all.

613
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,800
She didn't even think about me.

614
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,800
I'm just a useless person.

615
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
I'm just a useless person.

616
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:34,800
I don't believe in me anymore.

617
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,800
I'm wrong.

618
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,800
I'm wrong.

619
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,800
I'm wrong.

620
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,800
I'm wrong.

621
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,800
I'm wrong.

622
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,800
I'm wrong.

623
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,800
Master.

624
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,800
I'm sorry.

625
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,800
It's all my fault.

626
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,800
It's all my fault.

627
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,800
Master.

628
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,800
Master.

629
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,800
He's crying so heartlessly.

630
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,800
Master.

631
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,800
Master.

632
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,800
Who are you?

633
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,800
Why are you here?

634
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
I'm Bailing's friend.

635
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,800
I came to see you off for a few days.

636
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,800
I'll leave today.

637
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,800
I knew it was her.

638
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,800
I'm sorry

639
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,800
for making you see me like this.

640
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:53,800
I've never had any family or friends since I was little.

641
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,800
You're the only person who cares about me.

642
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,800
But I can't do anything.

643
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,800
I'm like you.

644
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,800
I don't have any friends now.

645
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:15,800
I don't have any friends now.

646
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,800
I don't have any family.

647
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,800
I don't know.

648
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,800
Me, either.

649
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,800
I didn't do anything right.

650
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,800
Even if there's only

651
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,800
us in this world,

652
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,800
you have to be yourself

653
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,800
and love yourself.

654
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,800
Only then

655
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,800
can you take responsibility

656
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:01,800
and take responsibility for your own actions.

657
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,800
It's because of your own heart

658
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,800
that you can live comfortably.

659
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,800
I'm sorry.

660
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,800
I'm sorry.

661
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,800
I'm sorry.

662
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,800
I'm sorry.

663
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,800
I'm sorry.

664
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,800
I'm sorry.

665
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,800
I'm sorry.

666
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,800
I'm sorry.

667
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,800
I'm sorry.

668
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,800
I'm sorry.

669
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,800
I'm sorry.

670
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,800
I'm sorry.

671
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,800
I'm sorry.

672
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,800
I'm sorry.

673
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,800
I'm sorry.

674
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,800
I'm sorry.

675
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,300
Passilly.

676
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,300
Terrible.

677
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,140
I don't want to make a mistake.

678
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,220
Go with me.

679
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,500
How can there be a woman in Cangwu Academy?

680
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,740
Act Battle

681
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,220
Huiong 하는데

682
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,900
Be prosperous. attractive

683
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,280
Be prosperous. attractive

684
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,500
Huiong contractor

685
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,260
Be careful with your words.

686
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,500
Be careful with your words.

687
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,300
Be careful with your words.

688
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,020
I've just been gone for a few months.

689
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,220
You guys are getting more and more irregular.

690
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,500
It's time.

691
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,660
We must save the day.

692
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,900
If anyone dares to go against Xiao Jin,

693
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,140
and wander around,

694
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,580
don't blame me for my unruly rules.

695
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:16,900
I'll make you embarrassed.

696
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,500
Yes.

697
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,660
After Brother Lu Jiu came back,

698
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,380
the patrol has been strengthened again.

699
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:34,860
So no matter what,

700
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,780
we must find the Lemon King tonight.

701
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,980
Hong Ning is right.

702
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,300
Maybe I should try to let her stay.

703
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:13,980
Hong Ning?

704
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,820
I'm the Lemon King.

705
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:15,780
Senior Brother.

706
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:17,900
Hong Ning please.

707
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,620
Ming Pu.

708
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:29,100
Hong Ning.

709
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:36,500
Who dares so boldly

710
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,700
to get close in the middle of night...

711
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:39,060
threat.

712
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,420
Master, why are you here?

713
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:45,540
That...

714
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:47,740
Yes, it happened suddenly.

715
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,140
I haven't told the court yet.

716
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,500
You two are really like rumors.

717
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:58,820
Yes.

718
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,460
Stop it.

719
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,620
In the future, whoever spreads rumors in the court

720
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,540
will be punished according to the rules of the prison.

721
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,340
Yes.

722
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:05,260
But, Master...

723
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:05,940
What is your honor?

724
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:07,980
You don't look around.

725
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,060
What are you doing here?

726
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:09,940
Hurry up and go.

727
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,700
And you two.

728
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:15,540
Go back to your rooms.

729
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,980
Copy the rules of the cell three times.

730
00:43:16,980 --> 00:43:17,700
What?

731
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,020
Yes.

732
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,260
What...

733
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,580
What are you talking about, Master?

734
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:28,580
Heavenly Maid.

735
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,620
I owe you an apology.

736
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,540
Lord Zhongtian still remembers?

737
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:38,940
Yes.

738
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:41,860
But for

739
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:43,700
that red tea flower.

740
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,980
I am not unreasonable.

741
00:43:59,100 --> 00:44:00,700
If you tell me your true feelings,

742
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,700
I can help you.

743
00:44:04,300 --> 00:44:05,540
But as a goddess,

744
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,060
you ruined my wedding on the day of the wedding.

745
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,340
You humiliated me and lied to me.

746
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,980
You made me the disgrace of the Northern Immortal Realm.

747
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,180
You made me the joke of the three realms.

748
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,900
You even made my father worry.

749
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,380
Lord Zhongtian.

750
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:22,580
I will avenge you one day.

751
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:24,060
I will definitely avenge you.

752
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:32,180
What happened in the past is my fault.

753
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,260
I have heard about the Northern Immortal Realm.

754
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,700
If there is any need for the Heavenly Maid in the future,

755
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,620
I will do my best.

756
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,060
No need.

757
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,500
We have been in love since that moment.

758
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:51,780
I only ask you one thing.

759
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,860
What is it?

760
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:58,540
Have you seen a fox with three tails in the desert?

761
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:05,460
A'Jiu is in this tree.

762
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,620
Where is A'Jiu?

763
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:09,700
Take me to see her.

764
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,140
So you only caught a fox and came back.

765
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,140
Did you catch this kind of fox?

766
00:45:19,740 --> 00:45:21,380
Did you catch other monsters?

767
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,100
Why are you two still together?

768
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,540
Why are you two still together?

769
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,540
Master.

770
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,460
I was wrong.

771
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:40,700
I caught her and brought her to the courtyard.

772
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,100
If you want to punish her, punish me first.

773
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,500
Take her to the guest room to settle down.

774
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:47,460
Go.

775
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:51,500
Go.

776
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,260
Thank you, Master.

777
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:53,700
No.

778
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,140
You haven't told me yet.

779
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,700
I just came out for a walk.

780
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:04,820
I think you should tell me.

781
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,020
What do you want to do?

782
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:13,460
Why do you always...

783
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,140
Master.

784
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,980
I have something to ask you.

785
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:17,820
Ask me?

786
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:21,740
I think you are like the immortal I often dream of.

787
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,260
Nonsense.

788
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:25,700
Nonsense?

789
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:28,340
Yes.

790
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:31,580
I think you are like Bai Ling.

791
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:33,060
Why can't it be her?

792
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,260
I think her back is getting more familiar.

793
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:40,220
So...

794
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:42,740
So you are different from her because of this?

795
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:45,220
Different from her?

796
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:51,300
Well.

797
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:53,620
It's late.

798
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:55,660
Go back quickly.

799
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,540
Okay.

800
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:02,220
Go.

801
00:47:04,220 --> 00:47:04,820
Go.

802
00:47:13,460 --> 00:47:14,460
Master scolded me again.

803
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,420
I have to patrol.

804
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:18,740
I found a woman in the warehouse.

805
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:20,820
Master doesn't allow me to do it.

806
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,020
I am such a useless man.

807
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:24,900
What should I do?

808
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:26,580
What should I do?

809
00:47:28,020 --> 00:47:30,380
You have seen the three-tailed fox in your mouth.

810
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,980
It's the deer that is patrolling.

811
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:38,060
Jiu just felt bad about the fact that she abandoned her in the Northern Realm.

812
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,300
The Heavenly Maid is now being modest.

813
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:41,980
I'm afraid she will be angry.

814
00:47:44,020 --> 00:47:44,740
Impossible.

815
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:46,580
He is my brother.

816
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:49,220
I don't believe he will be so heartless.

817
00:47:50,020 --> 00:47:51,300
You are his sister.

818
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:52,780
You should understand.

819
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:56,820
He might not accept you for a while.

820
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,100
Jiu.

821
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:03,940
What should I do?

822
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:05,500
What should I do?

823
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,220
