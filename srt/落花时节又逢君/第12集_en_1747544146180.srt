00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:13,040
Cichlone

2
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,040
I will follow you for a lifetime

3
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,040
Let me be drunk

4
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,040
The name in the painting

5
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,040
is waiting for the flowers to bloom

6
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,040
I will follow you for a lifetime

7
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,040
Let me be drunk

8
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,040
The name in the painting

9
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,040
is waiting for the flowers to bloom

10
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,040
The Long Ballad

11
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,040
Episode 2

12
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,040
The Long Ballad

13
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,040
Master Shen, you used his broken pieces to restore it.

14
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,040
What can you do?

15
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:48,040
I thought I would never see you again.

16
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,040
His painting is too weak.

17
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,040
It is more like a human form.

18
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,040
It is more like a loss of memory and consciousness.

19
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,040
Give me his transfer order.

20
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,040
I will send him away.

21
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,040
Master, you are in a hurry to leave the court.

22
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:11,040
The Night Fire Bridge is full of demons and mortals.

23
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,040
You are so weak now.

24
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,040
What if something happens to you?

25
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,040
Don't worry.

26
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,040
I will send him away.

27
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,040
All right.

28
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,040
You must be careful.

29
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,040
Hong Ni, let's go.

30
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,040
Don't be afraid.

31
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,040
I will protect you.

32
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,040
The Long Ballad

33
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,040
The Long Ballad

34
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,040
Master.

35
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,040
Master.

36
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,040
Master.

37
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:54,040
Master Shen, although you have the transfer order,

38
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,040
there is no regret about this tea.

39
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,040
Don't force yourself.

40
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,040
This is his only chance.

41
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
Step aside.

42
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Don't, Zhong Tian King.

43
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,040
No need to urge me.

44
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:08,040
Step aside.

45
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:10,040
The Night Fire Bridge is full of demons.

46
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,120
By any chance

47
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,680
Move

48
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,040
I'm afraid I won't be able to protect you.

49
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,040
I'm afraid I won't be able to protect you.

50
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
What should I do?

51
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,040
If this continues, I won't be able to reach the other side.

52
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
Hao Nian.

53
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,040
I don't know how long I can hold on.

54
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,040
Listen to me.

55
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,040
If I can't hold on,

56
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,040
you must run away.

57
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
Run away.

58
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
Hao Nian.

59
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
Hurry and run.

60
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,040
How could you do this?

61
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,040
You're not the only one who's hurt.

62
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,040
There are so many people on this earth.

63
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
If you don't do something,

64
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,040
then what will you do?

65
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,040
If you don't do something,

66
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
then what will you do?

67
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,040
I'm afraid I won't be able to protect you.

68
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,040
I don't know how long I can hold on.

69
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,040
I'm sorry.

70
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,040
I'm sorry.

71
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,040
I'm sorry.

72
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,040
I'm sorry.

73
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,040
I'm sorry.

74
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
Hao Nian.

75
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
I'm sorry.

76
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
I'm sorry.

77
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,040
Master Shen, please wait.

78
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:26,040
Xiao Hong Chao, go ahead.

79
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,040
Don't be afraid.

80
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
I'll go find you later.

81
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,040
It's a deal.

82
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,040
It's a deal.

83
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,040
It's a deal.

84
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:41,040
I'm sorry.

85
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,040
When can I see him again?

86
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,040
We'll meet again when the time comes.

87
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,040
I'm sorry.

88
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:40,040
I'm sorry.

89
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,040
Qi Qing.

90
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,040
Are we going to die?

91
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,040
We're not making it.

92
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,040
Even if we do die,

93
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,040
we won't let myself beน

94
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:16,040
except by giving you enchantments.

95
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,040
I was able to return the marriage.

96
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,240
Use all our strength.

97
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,040
Yes, my lord.

98
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,580
How is it?

99
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,300
General

100
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,360
the King's made some emergency treatment

101
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,720
and he can still wake up.

102
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:06,100
Make the King

103
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,100
Where is the Heavenly Maid?

104
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,100
She is still on the hunt.

105
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,100
Send more men.

106
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,100
If you can't get the Heavenly Maid back,

107
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,100
you all can't come back either.

108
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,100
Yes.

109
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,100
The Heavenly Emperor's order is

110
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,100
that you two should immediately go to the lower realm to make a pact.

111
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,100
The day the pact is successful

112
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,100
is the day the Heavenly Emperor's great unification is completed.

113
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,100
Isn't it enough for my brother to go alone to make a pact?

114
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,100
What fun can I have?

115
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,100
Your Star of Heaven and Earth is also shining.

116
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,100
Naturally, you should go.

117
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,100
According to the order of the Star of Heaven and Earth,

118
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,100
stop people from being jealous.

119
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,100
Once the cultivation is completed,

120
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,100
you can return to the heaven.

121
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,100
What if it's not completed?

122
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,100
The cycle continues to repeat.

123
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,100
Continue to complete.

124
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,100
No.

125
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,100
There is no end to it.

126
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,100
I'm jealous.

127
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,100
Do I have to go?

128
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,100
Ask again.

129
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,100
I won't ask.

130
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,100
Jinxiu,

131
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,100
you made a big mistake this time.

132
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,100
You should have been locked in the Hall of Judgment

133
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,100
and regretted it.

134
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,100
It's the Star of Heaven and Earth's order

135
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,100
that you can make a move.

136
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,100
I understand.

137
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,100
I will not disobey the order.

138
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,100
Jinxiu was so capable!

139
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,100
She's surroundings so far is more dangerous.

140
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,100
What on earth did you do?

141
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,100
Jinxiu was so capable!

142
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,100
She is surrounded so far and is so talented!

143
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,100
Brunner,

144
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,100
am I wrong?

145
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,100
Boxu,

146
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,100
do you not know

147
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,100
why the human security,

148
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:57,100
because you were involved with her,

149
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,100
you need to draw the line.

150
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:22,440
If we fail in the

151
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:22,980
faithful,

152
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,920
we might die.

153
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
No one can be an exception.

154
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,640
I shouldn't have expected anything from you.

155
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,200
I'm warning you.

156
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,080
They've already started to make a deal.

157
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,560
No immortal

158
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,560
can interfere.

159
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,520
If that's the case,

160
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,960
I wish Your Majesty

161
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,400
the best of luck.

162
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,400
Mother.

163
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,640
Father.

164
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,920
Have you thought it through about the red tea?

165
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,560
Have you thought about it?

166
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:31,640
If you hadn't brought the red tea demon to heaven,

167
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,680
he could have lived in the lower realm.

168
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,000
After hundreds of years, he became a little immortal

169
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,160
and was protected by the immortal world.

170
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,840
He was blessed with a life.

171
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,920
When I was your age,

172
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,640
I was also obsessed with my own feelings.

173
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,440
Are you really going to be so obsessed with your own feelings

174
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,160
because of your own children?

175
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,960
Don't you have any intention of repenting at all?

176
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,880
I only regret being an immortal

177
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,880
and being subdued by this immortal.

178
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,640
Why are you doing this?

179
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,880
Do you know the consequences of doing this?

180
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,000
Since I made the promise of the longevity hand,

181
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,880
I must keep my promise.

182
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:15,800
If there's any crime,

183
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,760
I'll be the only one to be punished.

184
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,440
You're greedy.

185
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,960
Those feelings and desires,

186
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,120
besides bringing harm to yourself and others,

187
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:27,560
what else can they bring?

188
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,280
Think about Kunlun.

189
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:33,920
You've been loving him since you were young.

190
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,960
But he's been punished for you many times.

191
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,480
You love that red tea flower,

192
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,560
but he's so tired of you.

193
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,480
You let go of your feelings.

194
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,480
What else can you bring

195
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,240
when you're happy?

196
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,800
Think about it.

197
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,280
What are you doing,

198
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,100
좀을

199
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:26,720
wait for me

200
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,360
and go.

201
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,200
Before I die,

202
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,680
bring me the golden coffins.

203
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,800
He doesn't have any left to be killed?

204
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,520
The coffins can only bring harm to you.

205
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,320
Zethi...

206
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,360
Since he chose you to be the Star of Heaven and Earth

207
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,920
he must have his reasons

208
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,000
How can you understand?

209
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,440
I just don't want to understand

210
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:57,360
Look at my brother

211
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:58,880
He has no freedom

212
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,560
If I were him, I would be suffocated

213
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,080
Why are you so muddled?

214
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,920
Okay, okay, okay

215
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,720
Okay

216
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,320
Well, mother

217
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,720
I'm going to complete the task of the Star of Heaven and Earth

218
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,720
I'll leave now

219
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,220
Carpenter

220
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:20,660
What are you doing?

221
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,440
What areat

222
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,400
What to do?

223
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,400
I have found her

224
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,280
I'm going in

225
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,320
Master

226
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,160
Who is she by the way?

227
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,920
Just in time.

228
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,560
Alas

229
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,000
Sister Dawn you're in.

230
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,920
Success.

231
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,040
Lord Tian Shu.

232
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,600
Jingxiu wants to set out the fields tomorrow with all trial for the world.

233
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,480
Can I ask Lord?

234
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,720
Any treasure to repetitive order oh?

235
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,000
to preserve my memory.

236
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,320
Hong Ning loved me with all her heart.

237
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,320
Now, because of me,

238
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,560
she is suffering from the Night Fire.

239
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,920
Jin Xiu is suffering from all the heavenly powers.

240
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:33,600
I just hope Hong Ning

241
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,760
can be safe in this life.

242
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,120
Thanks, my lord.

243
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,680
Greetings, Sky Deity.

244
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,680
Greetings, Your Highness.

245
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,880
The Star of Heaven and Earth will be going to the mortal realm tomorrow.

246
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:21,320
I'm here to make a wish to the gods

247
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,400
to keep them safe.

248
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,760
Your Highness is kind and kind. Please come in.

249
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:49,080
The Heaven's Book

250
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,520
My sliced goods were damaged,

251
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,440
that my original book is not going to buy them.

252
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,680
Don't blame me for my Pop fund.

253
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,360
If there is a day when the sky is full of darkness,

254
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,760
I hope that I can be the only one who is punished.

255
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,880
He has done something to the Heaven Book. I'll go take a look.

256
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,880
The Heaven Book has recovered.

257
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,680
The Heaven Book has recovered.

258
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,680
Get up.

259
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,280
I will watch you closely in the Heaven.

260
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,280
You must take good care of yourself.

261
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:01,080
Brother, this is a calamity.

262
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,680
What if I get bullied in the mortal world?

263
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,080
Who can bully you?

264
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:09,680
It's getting late. Let's go.

265
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:14,280
The Heaven Book has recovered.

266
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,880
I'm going to the Heaven Book.

267
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,680
I'll go take a look.

268
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,680
I'll go take a look.

269
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,680
Brother, I know that you don't want to be with me to discuss this matter.

270
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,280
So, I made special preparations.

271
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,280
Look, I made a mark here.

272
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:33,080
I'll go north. Remember?

273
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,680
Remember to come find me.

274
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,360
Yes.

275
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,720
Your Majesty,

276
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,600
Lord Zhongtian and Lord Kunlun

277
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,480
have entered the lower realm.

278
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,440
Has everything been smooth?

279
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,840
Lord Zhongtian secedly ascended grooms of Cang Wu Mountain

280
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,080
and became a nameless fool.

281
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,560
He was curtained

282
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,200
by the Cangwu School under upon control.

283
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,240
As you wish.

284
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,800
Cang Wu is a monster.

285
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,960
It's good that he's there to accumulate merit.

286
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,960
What about Kunlun Jun?

287
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,000
Kunlun Jun also became a monster

288
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,960
and became...

289
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,480
What?

290
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,120
A monster.

291
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,840
How is that possible?

292
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,520
Kunlun Jun is a god.

293
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,680
How could he be a monster?

294
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,120
Your Highness.

295
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:43,480
No matter how god or monster they are,

296
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,880
material homeless must have respect.

297
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,340
What your Majesty said is right.

298
00:24:48,920 --> 00:25:02,580
There're der Nóshal god who shall

299
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:06,920
take a place.

300
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:11,920
Is this the punishment from the Heaven Book?

301
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:19,920
Cangwu Mountain is located between the Northern Immortal Realm and the Middle Heaven.

302
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,920
It's a place where immortals, demons and humans frequently meet.

303
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,920
When the Northern Immortal Realm fell,

304
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,920
the Cangwu Realm was in chaos.

305
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,920
The people were not healed, but the Cangwu Heaven Leader was there.

306
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,920
He was there to protect the Emperor.

307
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,920
Go away!

308
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,920
Xiao! Xiao!

309
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,920
My lords, wake up!

310
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,920
Let my wife go! She's having a baby!

311
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:05,920
My wife! My wife!

312
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,920
I have silver here! I'll give it to you!

313
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,920
I'll give it to you!

314
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,920
Xiao! Xiao!

315
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:31,920
How are you?

316
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,920
Xiao!

317
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,920
Thank you, thank you!

318
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,920
We will definitely help you!

319
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:52,920
No need.

320
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,920
She is my savior.

321
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,920
I should protect her.

322
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:03,920
This hairpin, please keep it.

323
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,920
My lord, this child hasn't given her a name yet.

324
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,920
How about giving her a good name?

325
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,920
Hong Ning.

326
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,920
Hong Ning?

327
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,920
If you want to keep her safe,

328
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,920
don't go to Cangwu Mountain.

329
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,920
I hope you won't be tormented by your past life.

330
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,920
I hope you won't be tormented by your past life.

331
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,920
Hong Ning.

332
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,920
Hong Ning.

333
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,920
Hong Ning.

334
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,920
My lord.

335
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,920
Miss, come up!

336
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,920
Give me your hand!

337
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,920
Harder!

338
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,920
Harder!

339
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,920
Help!

340
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,920
Help!

341
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,920
Father!

342
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,920
Why are you sending these to the fifteen-year-old woman?

343
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,920
Aren't you afraid of losing your tone?

344
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,920
You can go back to the starts.

345
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,920
Don't change your mood!

346
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,920
Since you've decided to follow me,

347
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,920
you should just kill yourself once

348
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,920
and forget all the painful memories in the Northern Immortal Realm.

349
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:40,920
How can I forget something?

350
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,920
Didn't you forget her too?

351
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,920
Master, if you don't understand,

352
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:50,920
why don't you go see her if you miss her?

353
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,920
Cang Wu is the intersection between the Central Heaven and the Northern Immortal Realm.

354
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,920
These years, the demons have been fighting against this.

355
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,920
If she grows up with me,

356
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,920
she will be in danger.

357
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,920
In the past life, she was already dragged to death by me.

358
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,920
It's better not to see her.

359
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,920
Master, there are soldiers and demons who broke into Cang Wu School.

360
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,920
I'll go now.

361
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,920
There are soldiers and demons.

362
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,920
Let me go!

363
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,920
13th!

364
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,920
Where are they?

365
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:16,920
You guys are capable of treating me and a bunch of useless people like me.

366
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,920
What Cang Wu Mountain?

367
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,920
I thought you guys were powerful.

368
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,920
You guys are so capable of dealing with my puppets.

369
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,920
How dare you! How dare you enter my school!

370
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,920
I'll meet you today.

371
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,920
Master, let's go to the mountain.

372
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,920
I'll fight you.

373
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,920
Interesting. You!

374
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:51,920
You! I heard that the demons around here are afraid of you.

375
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,920
I want to see how powerful you are.

376
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,920
Can you block my three moves?

377
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,920
Okay.

378
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,920
I'll block your three moves.

379
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,920
Okay.

380
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,920
I'll block your three moves.

381
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,920
Okay.

382
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,920
I'll block your three moves.

383
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,920
Okay.

384
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,920
I'll block your three moves.

385
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,920
Okay.

386
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,920
I'll block your three moves.

387
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:38,920
Okay.

388
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,920
I'll block your three moves.

389
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,920
Okay.

390
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,920
I'll block your three moves.

391
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,920
Okay.

392
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:49,920
Hurry.

393
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,920
Hurry.

394
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,920
I'll block your three moves.

395
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,920
What the heck is that?

396
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,920
You're so bad at fighting.

397
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,520
You actually have magical powers?

398
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,000
You're a ice demon.

399
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,920
I only need to put a Night Fire

400
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,320
on the face of the flower and it can easily break your magical powers.

401
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:03,920
Look.

402
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,600
I made a mark here.

403
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,280
I'm going to the north.

404
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,280
Remember?

405
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:11,160
Remember to come to me.

406
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:13,840
Master.

407
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,480
I'm going to take this demon to the dungeon.

408
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,080
Why are you pulling my hand?

409
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:20,960
Kunlun.

410
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,960
How can you be a ice demon?

411
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:23,680
Kunlun.

412
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,680
You asked that?

413
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,080
I was born to be an ice demon.

414
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:27,200
I came from the ice.

415
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,240
Of course I'm an ice demon.

416
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,720
If you have the ability to catch me,

417
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,080
lock me up here.

418
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:31,560
You...

419
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,200
Master.

420
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,120
This demon is evil and is very cunning.

421
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,400
I'll take his internal energy immediately.

422
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:37,240
Master.

423
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,560
This ice demon is still young.

424
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,680
If it's locked up in the dungeon, it's too cruel.

425
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,680
Why don't you let it leave the cavern and die by itself?

426
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,480
You won't catch me?

427
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,640
For the sake of your young ignorance,

428
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,560
I won't mind you.

429
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,320
Let's go.

430
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,200
I don't want to stay in this shabby place.

431
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,000
Wait.

432
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:01,080
Do you want to learn magic from me?

433
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,120
Master.

434
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,200
You really want to teach me?

435
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,240
Yes.

436
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,240
But you have to promise me three conditions.

437
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,200
First,

438
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,800
don't hurt anyone.

439
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,400
Second,

440
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,480
you have to follow the rules of the cavern.

441
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,400
Just like other disciples of the cavern,

442
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,520
have a good rest.

443
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,080
What's so hard about that?

444
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,200
And third,

445
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,440
you have to go to the back hill to plant trees.

446
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:30,480
Plant trees?

447
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,720
Why?

448
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,640
Just tell me if you want to do it.

449
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:35,760
Fine.

450
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,240
What's so hard about that?

451
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:38,520
But

452
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,720
you have to promise me three conditions.

453
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:41,680
I'll take you in.

454
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,560
You're not only ungrateful,

455
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,720
but also dare to make conditions.

456
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,120
Tell me.

457
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,200
First,

458
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,800
don't let me pick firewood and sweep the ground.

459
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,320
Don't water me.

460
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:50,600
Second,

461
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,680
don't scold me, hit me, or dislike me.

462
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,000
Third,

463
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,960
I've offended many people and demons.

464
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:59,000
If they come to take revenge on me,

465
00:35:59,240 --> 00:35:59,960
you'll be the one to solve it.

466
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:02,880
It's a deal.

467
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,000
Fine.

468
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,120
Let me see where I live.

469
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,560
He's so sharp and sharp.

470
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,760
He's not a different person at all.

471
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,240
Master,

472
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,240
this little demon is powerful

473
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,400
and rough.

474
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:32,520
If he stays in the cavern,

475
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,040
it'll be a disaster.

476
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,960
It'll be a disaster if he stays elsewhere.

477
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:44,660
That crazy man

478
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:48,860
once pretentiously

479
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,340
sent me into the cavern

480
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,580
to relieve me of my weariness.

481
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,840
But he didn't do that,

482
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,200
so

483
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:03,800
I must do that.

484
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,560
Have you seen the doctor's report?

485
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:08,800
Yes.

486
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,220
Well,

487
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,220
I don't think it's a good idea.

488
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:17,220
Lord Zhong Tian is so nice to his father.

489
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:21,220
Master, I have something to hide from him.

490
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:23,220
I don't know how to tell you.

491
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:25,220
What is it?

492
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:32,220
Do you know that you almost fell into the devil's trap?

493
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,220
It's the Goddess Yi He.

494
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,220
I saw her tampering with the Heaven Book in the Tianshu Pavilion.

495
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,220
She exchanged your fates.

496
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,220
How did you get into the Tianshu Pavilion?

497
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:46,220
I...

498
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:50,220
I'm looking for Lord Zhong Tian.

499
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,220
He can't even resist the trick of the Fox Clan.

500
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,220
I got into the Tianshu Pavilion just for one move.

501
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:59,220
Lu Jiu, I thought you were poor and homeless.

502
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,220
That's why I brought you here.

503
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:07,220
I didn't expect you to be so kind to me.

504
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:11,220
Master, I didn't do anything bad.

505
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,220
I just wanted to find you.

506
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:18,220
My mother seems to be very strict with Kelen.

507
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,220
In fact, she cares about him very much.

508
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,220
I guess she cares about me too.

509
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:41,220
Maybe I've never felt the love of my parents.

510
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,220
That's why I can't understand it.

511
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,220
Bai Ling is a playful person.

512
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:56,220
She offended many of the disciples in the yard.

513
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,220
I'm going to close the case tomorrow.

514
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,220
You...

515
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,220
There are many people in the world.

516
00:39:01,220 --> 00:39:03,220
As long as you are kind,

517
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,220
I will be happy.

518
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,220
As long as you are kind, we should welcome you.

519
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:11,220
Master, you've been protecting the people of Cangwu.

520
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:13,220
You've been protecting the people of Cangwu.

521
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,220
I remember your teachings.

522
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:21,220
I'll tell my brother to guide him and correct his mistakes.

523
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,220
And...

524
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,220
I'll protect Hong Ning and Wang Village for you.

525
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,220
Master, don't worry about closing the case.

526
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,220
Bai Ling, study hard.

527
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,220
I know, Senior.

528
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,220
You should go.

529
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:02,220
Master.

530
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,220
Master.

531
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:08,220
Can I be your empress?

532
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,220
Master.

533
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,220
Actually, I don't like to be a cultivator.

534
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:38,220
Hong Ning, you had a nightmare again?

535
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,220
Mother.

536
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,220
Look at your cold face.

537
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,220
Is it the same as before?

538
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,220
But I still don't know who she is.

539
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,220
Good girl, don't be afraid.

540
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,220
It's just a dream.

541
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,220
I'm here.

542
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,220
Look at you.

543
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:04,220
You almost freeze to ice.

544
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,220
Mother.

545
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:10,220
Why do I always dream about her?

546
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,220
Who is she?

547
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,220
Don't think about it.

548
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:18,220
It's just a dream.

549
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:36,220
I'm here.

550
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,220
I'm here.

551
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,220
I'm here.

552
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,220
I'm here.

553
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:40,220
I'm here.

554
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,220
I'm here.

555
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,220
I'm here.

556
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,220
I'm here.

557
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,220
I'm here.

558
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:58,220
The white flower and the demon are so shallow.

559
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:01,220
But they want to change their destiny.

560
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,220
What's that?

561
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:07,220
Maybe they have been a human for a long time.

562
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:11,220
They really think they are human.

563
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,220
What do you want to say?

564
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,220
I know.

565
00:42:21,220 --> 00:42:26,220
You are so down because of a black tea and a flower demon.

566
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:29,220
You know that?

567
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,220
You know that?

568
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,220
How is she now?

569
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:39,220
She is in heaven.

570
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,220
She is alive.

571
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,220
She is alive.

572
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,220
The demon has been in a coma for thousands of years.

573
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,220
You are in the Qi Lin Cave.

574
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:01,220
I think you have been sinned a lot.

575
00:43:21,220 --> 00:43:23,220
We are all demons.

576
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:25,220
I am your colleague.

577
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:30,220
They are our enemies.

578
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:36,220
I am related to you.

579
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:44,220
Do you know that you are expelled from the immortal realm?

580
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:50,220
You will have no more immortal fate when you fall into the flower fairy pool.

581
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:55,220
I know.

582
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:02,220
But your black tea and flower demon is in heaven.

583
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:06,220
She is entangled with the immortal.

584
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,220
And she is in love with the immortal.

585
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:17,220
One day, she will stand against you.

586
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:22,220
She will abandon you and betray you.

587
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:25,220
She will even...

588
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,220
be more cruel.

589
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:34,220
Impossible.

590
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,220
She will never betray me.

591
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,220
Demons are demons.

592
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,220
They will never be immortal.

593
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:49,220
Everything is a lie.

594
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:54,220
You are so arrogant.

595
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,220
You are so arrogant.

596
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:03,220
I won't kill you.

597
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:08,220
If one day she betrays you,

598
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:13,220
you will know the consequences.

599
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:15,220
How can it be?

600
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,220
Wait and see.

601
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,220
Wait and see.

602
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:35,220
She will never betray me.

603
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,220
Never.

604
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:56,220
The dream is like a dream.

605
00:45:57,220 --> 00:46:00,220
What's the point of exchanging our love?

606
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,220
The journey is long.

607
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:05,220
The past has gone with the wind.

608
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:12,220
But we meet again.

609
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:18,220
We are like strangers.

610
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,220
We are like strangers.

611
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:27,220
I hope this life will be full of love.

612
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:33,220
We used to be together.

613
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,220
The world is falling apart.

614
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:46,220
We meet again.

615
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:52,220
Please give me your name.

616
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:58,220
I still remember that day.

617
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,220
When the flowers bloom,

618
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,220
I will keep you company.

619
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:11,220
I will play the wind and rain with you.

620
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:17,220
Please give me your name.

621
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:20,220
I still remember that day.

622
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,220
When the flowers bloom,

623
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:29,220
I will keep you company.

624
00:47:30,220 --> 00:47:36,220
I will play the wind and rain with you.

625
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:38,220
I still remember that day.

626
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:41,220
When the flowers bloom,

627
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,220
I will keep you company.

628
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:50,220
I will play the wind and rain with you.

629
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:57,220
I will play the wind and rain with you.

630
00:47:58,220 --> 00:48:04,220
I will play the wind and rain with you.

631
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:11,220
I will play the wind and rain with you.
