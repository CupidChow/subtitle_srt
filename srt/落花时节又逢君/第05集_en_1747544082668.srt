1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Only I am drunk

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
In the painting, waiting for you

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Waiting for the flowers to bloom

4
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Episode 16

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
God of Flower

6
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Jinxiu

7
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
How dare you call out the name of God of Flower

8
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You have a god's seal

9
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You, you are God of Flower

10
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Hong Ning

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You, you, you know me

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
My God of Flower sister must be very, very, very beautiful

13
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Beautiful and kind

14
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Very good person

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Then I tell you, I am God of Flower

16
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The God of Flower I want to find is here

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Here, here, there is a God of Flower God of Flower

18
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
So it won't be like you

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Nothing, nothing, just wandering around here

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You

21
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Red tea monster, you not only left the painting

22
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
This red tea flower has not yet bloomed

23
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You are not qualified to participate in the flower exhibition

24
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
God of Flower

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Red tea monster has a flower world

26
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Why don't you give it a chance?

27
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Yes, God of Flower

28
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You give it another chance

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
God of Flower

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Put on your flower

31
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Look, nothing has changed

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
What is this?

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
After a long time, the flower has not bloomed

34
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The flower life has not been

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You still have the face to participate in the flower exhibition

36
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
This flower has not bloomed, you can leave

37
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This, God of Flower

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
God of Flower

39
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
The flower has bloomed, the flower has bloomed, God of Flower

40
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Why is it not blooming?

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's blooming

42
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's blooming

43
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This is so beautiful

44
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
This is really beautiful

45
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
So beautiful

46
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
This is not red tea flower at all

47
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
This is not right

48
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
This is not a flower

49
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I have seen a hundred flowers

50
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I have never seen such a flower

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Say

52
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Did you lose some magic?

53
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I didn't

54
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I didn't do anything

55
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
This is a flower of the earth grass

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Earth grass

57
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Earth grass

58
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Earth grass is not a grass in the world

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It has its own spirituality

60
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
But because of its strong attack

61
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It also eats other flowers and trees as food

62
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
So it is difficult to cultivate

63
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
You are the same

64
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
How did you grow it?

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I

66
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I seem to

67
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Once the earth grass is rooted

68
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's hard to remove

69
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I think

70
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
It's open only with your red tea flower as a nutrient

71
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Red tea monster didn't grow red tea flower

72
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You guys should take it down

73
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I

74
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Why did Hong Ning plant red tea flower on the land of earth grass?

75
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I think you know this very well

76
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Red tea flower is not your fault if it is rooted by earth grass

77
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Earth grass is born to be unable to cultivate

78
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
And it is difficult to cultivate

79
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So no one can treat it equally and patiently

80
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Now

81
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It blooms because you sacrifice your own spiritual power

82
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's the first time in ten thousand years

83
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
So it seems that it's not innocent but it's meritorious

84
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Red tea monster

85
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Since the god has given you a reward

86
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Hurry up and thank him

87
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Thank you, God

88
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
What reward do you want?

89
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Can I want anything?

90
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You talk about it first

91
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
If you can do it, of course you can

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Can I be your goddess?

93
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What are you laughing at?

94
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What are you laughing at?

95
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Red tea flower monster

96
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
You don't even know what the wedding is

97
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Why do you ask this question?

98
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I want to repay the favor

99
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
God saved me

100
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
There are thousands of ways to repay the favor

101
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Moreover

102
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Saving flowers is the duty of the King of the Heavens to manage the Hua Zhao Palace

103
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
He also saved the snow-blossom flowers in my palace before

104
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Does the snow-blossom flower have to be his goddess?

105
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
The Heavenly Maid is right

106
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Of course

107
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
There are ten flowers in hundreds of flowers

108
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It was saved by the God himself

109
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Do you have to repay the favor like you?

110
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Then I

111
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
How do I repay the favor?

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The Heavenly Maid is a fairy

113
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Then, let's be a fairy

114
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Be a fairy?

115
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Be a fairy

116
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Then, can I be with you after I become a fairy?

117
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Let's be a fairy first

118
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes

119
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
See you, Your Excellency

120
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You

121
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You are here

122
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I've been waiting for you for a long time

123
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
How did he come out?

124
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
This has nothing to do with me

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
You see for yourself

126
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
You see for yourself

127
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
I'm here

128
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm here

129
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I'm here

130
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I'm here

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I'm here

132
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I'm here

133
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I'm here

134
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
See

135
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Why didn't I think of it?

136
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
This flower bag is impossible to count

137
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
The answer to the eighth fire is zero

138
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Right?

139
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
This red-brained little demon

140
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
He's still a little bit capable

141
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I let him beg me

142
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
He refused to beg

143
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Where did you find such an interesting monster?

144
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
By the way

145
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Why does he keep chasing you and not let you go?

146
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Are you doing something to him?

147
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What's wrong with you two?

148
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Something's wrong

149
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I won't say it

150
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I won't say it

151
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Let's go

152
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Where are you going?

153
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Father and mother called me

154
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Is there any other good idea?

155
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Yes

156
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You want to fight with me?

157
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I tell you

158
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I'm not bored in the flower picture

159
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Today I will definitely take you down

160
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Come

161
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Come

162
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
What?

163
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
You actually said I was not there

164
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The pain sea is secretly cut to the third level

165
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I didn't take advantage of your absence

166
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
And I didn't steal

167
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Then

168
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Then you have to untie me first, right?

169
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I feel ashamed

170
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
You are so cruel

171
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I

172
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
You are afraid of shame

173
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Others have long seen the monster

174
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Why can this red-brained demon stay?

175
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
If it had been so

176
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I shouldn't have sent him to the flower shop

177
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
In the eatery

178
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He even fell andarellaened

179
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
100 per cent

180
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
At that moment

181
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
He took the flowers

182
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
To find them

183
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
See you

184
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Heavenly Maid

185
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
6thline

186
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I made a hair's treat

187
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
To make a joke

188
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
It is unnecessary

189
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You are comating to Lord Shen superpower, right?

190
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
secretly

191
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I am a seeker

192
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You can go

193
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
I am coming for you

194
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,680
Don't forget it.

195
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,160
You must be careful

196
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,040
before that.

197
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,680
My respects to Father, Your Highness the King,

198
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,480
ow.

199
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,700
It took hundreds of years

200
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,920
for you all these petals

201
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,320
to grow into our form.

202
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:06,400
Mother.

203
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,960
You don't know

204
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,040
how many Uh Netflix contents

205
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,800
do outside fans

206
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,440
And the flowers in the garden

207
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,240
are dying and growing.

208
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,040
It's torture.

209
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,000
But

210
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,800
although I suffered,

211
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,920
I've also learned my mind, right?

212
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:26,800
There are not only food and drink in the garden.

213
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
You don't have to be busy in the palace.

214
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,600
Most importantly,

215
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,440
you don't have to see me and your father.

216
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,480
You've suffered.

217
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,720
Mother.

218
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,160
My brother has been

219
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,920
reflecting on himself.

220
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:42,320
He destroyed the whole Cangwu back hill.

221
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,440
How can you protect him?

222
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:45,960
Alright.

223
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,680
It happened hundreds of years ago.

224
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,120
I'm tired of it.

225
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,920
I can't do this.

226
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,040
Jinxiu.

227
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,800
He really counted all the petals.

228
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,480
Stop protecting him.

229
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,800
If the petals of the white-flower picture are not counted,

230
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,960
it won't come out.

231
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,240
Kunlun

232
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,160
did count all the petals.

233
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,440
How many petals are there in total?

234
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,200
Mother.

235
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,440
I...

236
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,240
I'll tell you in private.

237
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,240
Father.

238
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,280
I really know my mistake.

239
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,360
I'll find a way to make up for

240
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:21,240
the divine plants in the back hill.

241
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,560
You've improved.

242
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,680
Your Majesty.

243
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,360
Now Kunlun has returned to the throne.

244
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,960
You should arrange some things for him.

245
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,400
You're right.

246
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,400
But

247
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,520
I asked you to take charge of the weather.

248
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,480
You've made a mess.

249
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,080
Let's start with something simple.

250
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,400
Jinxiu.

251
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,080
If there's anything missing in the painting,

252
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,040
arrange it for your brother.

253
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,400
Yes.

254
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,400
Thank you, father.

255
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,960
I'll follow my brother to practice.

256
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,320
Shenhou.

257
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,000
What do you think?

258
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,840
If you make any trouble again,

259
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,040
I'll punish you personally.

260
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,840
Yes, mother.

261
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,900
Your Majesty.

262
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,600
This is the sacred food of heart group.

263
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,440
Endure a thousand years of spiritual energy through it.

264
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,360
It's good for cultivation.

265
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,080
Tian Nu.

266
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,760
It's too precious.

267
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,840
You works overtime.

268
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,840
Do what you should do.

269
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,640
This is what I must do.

270
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,080
Dam presidents often talk to again flowers.

271
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,680
You care a lot for him.

272
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,680
If there's not you,

273
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,120
there's no way I can help to share his burden.

274
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,720
Your Majesty.

275
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,560
I'm sorry.

276
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,360
I didn't know you and Master have a engagement.

277
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,600
I'm just waiting for Master to return to the Heaven Realm

278
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,960
to make a big ceremony.

279
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,600
What engagement?

280
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,040
It's just a joke

281
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,560
between my father and Dijing.

282
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,560
I can't take it.

283
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,840
Today,

284
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,240
there's still a little fairy

285
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,840
to confess to Master.

286
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
Red tea is a shameless

287
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,200
wild flower that doesn't know etiquette.

288
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,320
Do you know?

289
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,080
It's from Mount Baizhou.

290
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,960
Mount Baizhou?

291
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,040
Then it's a...

292
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,440
demon?

293
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,480
That's right.

294
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,520
It's a demon with thousands of needles.

295
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,520
It broke the flower spell and opened the flower.

296
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,880
It was punished by Master

297
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,400
by being trapped in the Heaven Realm.

298
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:26,240
It's caused a lot of trouble lately.

299
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,320
Master, you actually left the demon in the Heaven Realm.

300
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,920
I don't know.

301
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,800
The Mountain Tea Clan has been lost for a long time.

302
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,880
It can't save the fairy.

303
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,360
Master, you have a lot of regrets.

304
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
It's not easy to meet a demon.

305
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,000
No wonder.

306
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,760
Don't worry, Heavenly Maid.

307
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,840
Even if she has a deep connection,

308
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,680
she doesn't know the rules.

309
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,240
She won't stay long.

310
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,080
Immortal Mei,

311
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,280
this is a complete script.

312
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,360
You need to check

313
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,880
all the talents of the fairy.

314
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,240
Then help me

315
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,720
select the twelve flowers.

316
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,960
Yes.

317
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,680
These flowers are more beautiful than they were hundreds of years ago.

318
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,400
It depends on you

319
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,960
staying in the Flower Land for hundreds of years.

320
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,680
Otherwise, these flowers

321
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,880
wouldn't be so beautiful.

322
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,160
You don't have to thank me.

323
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,000
Come on.

324
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,480
There's no idle work in the Flower Palace.

325
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,360
Since you like drinking so much,

326
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,920
go to watch the garden.

327
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,080
The lily is in its flower season.

328
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,000
It needs to be nourished every day and night.

329
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,480
Don't be too late.

330
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:45,920
Okay.

331
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,800
Don't worry.

332
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,040
It's not difficult.

333
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,840
Your Grace.

334
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,640
Lord Kunlun.

335
00:16:58,880 --> 00:16:59,880
Fairy.

336
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,440
Your Grace.

337
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,800
These flowers have important news.

338
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:05,840
Your Grace.

339
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,480
The red tea monster has broken the rules repeatedly.

340
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,440
He didn't even break into the Flower Exhibition.

341
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,400
If he stays in the Flower Exhibition,

342
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,760
it's hard to convince everyone.

343
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,600
How can he break in?

344
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,680
I brought him in.

345
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,080
If you're not satisfied,

346
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,000
why didn't you make a proposal?

347
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,360
I dare not

348
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,960
obey your order.

349
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,760
You dare not obey me

350
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,880
or the fairy?

351
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,000
I dare not.

352
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,280
Your Grace.

353
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,560
I'm willing to be punished

354
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,960
for breaking the rules.

355
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:36,880
But

356
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,480
the rules are rules.

357
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,280
I'm willing to expel the red tea monster

358
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
from the Flower Exhibition.

359
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,080
When will you decide

360
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,080
whether to stay or not?

361
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,600
But the red tea monster is a monster.

362
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,080
You weren't a monster before.

363
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,680
I...

364
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:58,840
Fairy Mei.

365
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,320
What do you think about it?

366
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
I think

367
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,120
the red tea monster shouldn't be allowed

368
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,480
to enter the garden.

369
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,040
But he made the red tea monster

370
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,400
stay in the palace for a while.

371
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,320
But he's a monster now.

372
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,760
He'll be a nuisance

373
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,560
if he stays in the Flower Exhibition.

374
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:19,720
Brother.

375
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,400
How about this?

376
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:22,960
Let him

377
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:23,960
follow me.

378
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,800
He's smart and has a good foresight.

379
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,720
If he stays with me to protect the nine gardens,

380
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,880
I'll teach him a good lesson.

381
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,840
Go to the garden.

382
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,840
switched to the Red Tea Monster.

383
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,400
Yes.

384
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,160
So ingenious.

385
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,240
Work.

386
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,480
Let's go the three- stand garden.

387
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:42,760
All right.

388
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,840
You played estou중 agency

389
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,400
to expel

390
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,280
the red tea kick explosive.

391
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,880
F strain my responsibility

392
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,480
and she was blamed

393
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,280
all on behalf of you.

394
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,320
Use power to commit suicide.

395
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,140
I know you can't read

396
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:59,120
who learned treatise

397
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,040
that the Seven朵 Mia person is falling love in the aria.

398
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,640
I've been giving you spirit energy for hundreds of years.

399
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,040
I'm not enough to make you remember.

400
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,120
Go to the Water Moon Mirror and reflect on yourself.

401
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,440
Your Grace, I'm wronged!

402
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,680
I did all this

403
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,160
for the sake of Hua Zhaogong!

404
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:15,520
If you really did it for Hua Zhaogong,

405
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,840
then you're not a good person

406
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,080
and you don't know the rules.

407
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,280
Take her away.

408
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,800
Your Grace!

409
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:29,640
Your Grace.

410
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:30,920
You don't need to plead for her.

411
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,880
You can figure it out when you want to come out.

412
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,400
Yes.

413
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,720
The wonderful water...

414
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,480
The beautiful water...

415
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,880
It's all under my control.

416
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,040
Here we are.

417
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,640
But some flowers have hurt the roots.

418
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,480
They are rotten and withered.

419
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,760
They need to be carefully treated to be able to bloom.

420
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,360
So they all came into this garden.

421
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,880
Then I came here because...

422
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,800
Since you entered Hua Zhao Palace,

423
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,360
you have broken countless rules.

424
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,440
Moreover, you have not been able to enter the inner courtyard of Hua Zhao Palace.

425
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,240
You should have been expelled from the lower realm.

426
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,560
It's our Shen Zun's kindness

427
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,680
that kept you here to continue your cultivation.

428
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,680
But punishment cannot be avoided.

429
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,240
Before you become an immortal,

430
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,560
you should live here.

431
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,680
Like this.

432
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:35,560
micronica

433
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,900
lia ch체가

434
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:57,800
!

435
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:03,920
Houning.

436
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:05,960
Houning.

437
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,200
Houning.

438
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:09,880
Shaoyao.

439
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,960
Why do you come here?

440
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,200
There are some Pot doctors in the påg.

441
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,680
So I brought one.

442
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,360
Oh, you do talk nonsense.

443
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:20,400
Take it.

444
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,080
You do think of me so much.

445
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,840
Wait for me.

446
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,840
Stop it.

447
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,800
So the fairy you mentioned

448
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,320
is the Flower Immortal?

449
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:38,200
But

450
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,520
he doesn't have a magic seal on his forehead.

451
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,920
Magic seal?

452
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,080
The magic seal is like the face of the emperor of the mortal world.

453
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,280
It only appears when the priest

454
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,840
is praying to the devil.

455
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,000
How can it be so easy to see?

456
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,680
Wait.

457
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,320
Who doesn't know the Holy Master in the Hua Zhao Palace?

458
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm convinced.

459
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,920
Yes.

460
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,160
There's a stupid red-naked man in the Hua Zhao Palace.

461
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,360
He doesn't know

462
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,240
that the Flower Immortal and the Holy Master are the same person.

463
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,600
You're trying to trick me again.

464
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,760
I'm telling you, it's all because of this fairy.

465
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,720
If it wasn't for her,

466
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,400
the Holy Master wouldn't have let you come here.

467
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,320
But she's now under the punishment of being punished to see the Water Moon Mirror.

468
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,040
She can be released for a few days.

469
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,440
It's okay, Shaoyao.

470
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
I really think it's pretty good here.

471
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:21,880
Look.

472
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,160
If I can make them bloom more flowers,

473
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,000
can I also increase my cultivation?

474
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,680
Besides, the Holy Master wants me to practice hard.

475
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,160
I do need to practice hard.

476
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,760
You!

477
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,320
You're so silly.

478
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:37,920
You don't even know that you're being bullied.

479
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
If I had you, they wouldn't bully me.

480
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,480
Besides the names of the immortals,

481
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:46,880
I also picked

482
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,680
the seventeen immortals such as Tumi, Lan Hua

483
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
and the twelve Flower Immortals.

484
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,840
Hong Ning,

485
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:54,800
have you sent her to the Flower Garden?

486
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,320
I have.

487
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,920
That red tea flower...

488
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,760
Is there a problem?

489
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,600
The Flower Garden lacks sunlight and rain.

490
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,640
It's very bad for her to bloom flowers.

491
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,800
She's a real man.

492
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,880
I'm afraid she'll cause trouble if she stays in the Flower Palace.

493
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,240
Besides,

494
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:17,280
the cultivation of the flower

495
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:19,360
will be of great help to her cultivation.

496
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,680
I think we should let her stay there for now.

497
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,360
I understand.

498
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,720
Kunlun, take good care of her.

499
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,600
Don't let her cause trouble again.

500
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,480
Yes, I understand.

501
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,520
All right.

502
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,560
As long as the flowers are in the Flower Garden,

503
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,680
I'll take them.

504
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,680
Okay, I'll do this.

505
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,800
Don't worry.

506
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,640
If you know the trick,

507
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,520
see for yourself!

508
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,800
Just wait a moment.

509
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:05,120
姑娘,

510
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,560
take Nian'an away first.

511
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,720
plane and sure,

512
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,040
get some water and sunlight.

513
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,680
It'll be recovered soon.

514
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,680
Thank you, Shaoyao.

515
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,160
You're right.

516
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,600
It took you so long

517
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,280
to confess your love to Sovereign Buddha,

518
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,080
You just said you wanted to be a goddess.

519
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,760
I wanted to repay your kindness.

520
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,400
No, no, no.

521
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,520
Only if you like someone,

522
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,440
you will marry him.

523
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,280
What do you mean by like someone?

524
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,960
Like.

525
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,600
Like means

526
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:42,240
you will treat his happiness and sorrow

527
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,720
as your own.

528
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,520
You will also think he is more important than you.

529
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,760
Sometimes you will even forget yourself.

530
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,040
Like.

531
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,840
You want to be with him.

532
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,840
When you can't see him, you miss him very much.

533
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,360
Sometimes you feel time flies.

534
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,520
Sometimes you feel time flies very slowly.

535
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,200
Right?

536
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,080
Yes.

537
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,360
That's it.

538
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,080
And you can't just say you like him.

539
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,560
You have to make sure of your heart.

540
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,280
You have to think for him.

541
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,160
Anyway, you can't just say it.

542
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,440
You can't just say it.

543
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,760
I must like you.

544
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,800
Shaoyao, why do you know so much?

545
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,120
When you were growing up in the mortal world,

546
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,640
where did you grow up?

547
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,880
I grew up in a place with a lot of people.

548
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,520
There are many beautiful people around.

549
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,480
I saw people coming and going every day.

550
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:45,960
I saw a lot of people.

551
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,120
So I waited.

552
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,160
This place is so nice.

553
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,080
What's the name?

554
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,360
Shaohua Garden.

555
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,080
Shaohua Garden?

556
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,360
I've never heard of it.

557
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,680
Where is the Dragon God?

558
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,560
It's time to go on a thunderous journey.

559
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,720
Here he comes.

560
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,960
Episode heeft

561
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:33,080
God of going down

562
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,160
Shen Zun.

563
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,520
I should have believed you.

564
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,480
You're Goddess Floripurple!

565
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,300
The open chrysanthemum

566
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,140
is used to control magic and soul.

567
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,460
The spirit of the Flower Wood

568
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:48,340
is the unique power of the Flower Wood Clan.

569
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,780
You're not good at it.

570
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,060
You can't do it.

571
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,460
But I listen to the fairy's words every day

572
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,740
to practice.

573
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,620
You have to start practicing

574
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,260
from the most basic way of changing the spirit.

575
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,240
Try to do it.

576
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,600
Sit.

577
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,440
I'm sorry.

578
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,280
Every part of the flower and wood is

579
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,400
immersed in the body.

580
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,000
The first thing you need to do

581
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,960
is to awaken the spirit power.

582
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,880
Master,

583
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,120
can I be your fairy

584
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,360
when I become an immortal?

585
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,640
As long as you cultivate yourself as an immortal,

586
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,040
you'll be a blessing.

587
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:46,720
It has nothing to do with marriage.

588
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,960
But I like you.

589
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,840
I want to be your fairy.

590
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:52,800
Nonsense.

591
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,080
Do you know what is like?

592
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,760
Of course I know.

593
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,920
Young Master has told me.

594
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,760
Like is

595
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,520
to see you every day and every moment.

596
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,000
I'm happy to see you.

597
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:08,000
I want to be with you forever.

598
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,280
Stop talking.

599
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,960
A fairy is a bookmark.

600
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,400
Don't talk nonsense.

601
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,560
A fairy?

602
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,080
Why do you want to be a bookmark?

603
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,720
You're a fairy and I'm a demon.

604
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,720
We should stay together, right?

605
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,320
I'm trying to make you an immortal.

606
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,600
Demons are evil.

607
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,880
They are everywhere.

608
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,000
They are all evil.

609
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,160
A fairy who is a demon

610
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,680
should be punished by heaven.

611
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,120
It's not like that.

612
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,120
You can go back to Baizhou Mountain with me.

613
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,520
Baizhou Mountain is not as evil as you said.

614
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,320
My good friends are demons.

615
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,080
But they are all good demons.

616
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,280
They didn't do the bad things you said.

617
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,080
But

618
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,320
the mortal is evil and has been in the east for ten years.

619
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,720
If a group of villains are evil,

620
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,440
everyone will suffer.

621
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,400
How dare you!

622
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:52,960
The ten years in the east

623
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,760
are punishments for the crime of mortal.

624
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,240
But most mortals are innocent.

625
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,320
You can't punish

626
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,080
the one and the other

627
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,760
because of a group of villains.

628
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,960
We good demons

629
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,080
should be punished by heaven.

630
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,800
How dare you question the law of heaven?

631
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,160
I didn't question it.

632
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,560
It's wrong.

633
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,520
You...

634
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,680
I will have a good rest

635
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,560
and become your empress.

636
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,400
You are so ignorant.

637
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,360
The ten years in the east

638
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,760
are punishments for the crime of mortal.

639
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,440
But everyone will suffer.

640
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,280
Yes.

641
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,320
What?

642
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,280
No.

643
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,640
Definitely not.

644
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,720
But if you can't let go of your punishment,

645
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,560
how can you defeat the evil?

646
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,160
Yes.

647
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,080
If you can't defeat the evil,

648
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,400
why are you talking about the mortal?

649
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,120
Yes.

650
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,400
I should have said so.

651
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,640
You shouldn't.

652
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,240
But he said it again.

653
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,800
There will be innocent people suffering.

654
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,960
But this is the order.

655
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,400
Yes.

656
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,760
How dare you question the law of heaven?

657
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,360
My lord, don't be angry.

658
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,640
You are a bad guy.

659
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,200
Who are you with?

660
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,160
None of your business.

661
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:08,920
No, my lord.

662
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:09,720
I don't care.

663
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:10,680
But I have to write a poem.

664
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:11,400
I...

665
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:12,960
No.

666
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,000
My lord.

667
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,080
My lord.

668
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,640
Why are you staring at me?

669
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:18,840
My lord.

670
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,720
Why are you looking at me?

671
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,920
My lord, let me go.

672
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,280
No.

673
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,240
Help.

674
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,040
Come here.

675
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,600
who has stayed here

676
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,480
for years

677
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,800
Master

678
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,560
But I don't know why

679
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,360
I'm getting more and more tired.

680
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,840
You can't even handle a regular thunder.

681
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,320
You know that the thunder of the Heaven Realm

682
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,880
is thousands of times stronger than this.

683
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,800
Then I won't be killed by it, right?

684
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:00,240
The most basic way to get thunder is to change the form.

685
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,240
Try to change into the appearance of the Snow-Flying Tree.

686
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:14,080
I can't change it if you look at me.

687
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,720
Why?

688
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,080
I'm nervous.

689
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:20,880
If you're nervous,

690
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,240
just chant the Star Spell.

691
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:24,800
Calm your mind and practice to be weak.

692
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,440
How can you not know the most basic way to control your temperament?

693
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,760
Wake up. I'm not looking at you.

694
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,080
I'm not looking at you.

695
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,440
I'm not looking at you.

696
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:38,600
I'm not looking at you.

697
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,720
I'm not looking at you.

698
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,560
I'm not looking at you.

699
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,240
Hurry up.

700
00:33:58,760 --> 00:33:59,560
Remember.

701
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:02,160
The core of all spells is concentration.

702
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,600
Concentrate, concentrate, focus.

703
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,480
Think about how you want to change.

704
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,160
Then concentrate your spiritual power on your fingertips.

705
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,160
Just like the appearance of the Snow-Flying Tree.

706
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,160
You...

707
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,440
Didn't I just tell you to concentrate?

708
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,160
Why did you turn into a peony?

709
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,240
Because you're the only thing that's on my mind.

710
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Master Shen Zun.

711
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,720
I want to ask you something.

712
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,080
Do you like me?

713
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,520
You said at the painting show that

714
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,360
as long as I become an immortal,

715
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,240
you'll marry me as the Queen of the Gods.

716
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,840
Don't forget that.

717
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,520
Don't be ridiculous.

718
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,720
Practice hard.

719
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,320
And...

720
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,000
Wipe your face.

721
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,440
What's going on?

722
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,240
I must have obtained the Immortal Skill.

723
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,320
It can't be.

724
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,360
It can't be.

725
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:52,640
You...

726
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,960
Didn't I just tell you to concentrate?

727
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,680
Why did you turn into a peony?

728
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,000
Because you're the only thing that's on my mind.

729
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,240
Do you like me?

730
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,760
I don't know.

731
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:04,960
I don't know.

732
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,680
Do you like me?

733
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,080
Just throw it away.

734
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:33,840
Qing Xin.

735
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,520
Qing Xin.

736
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,200
Mind your own business.

737
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,360
Practice is the essence.

738
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,380
As long as you become the messiah of the dead

739
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,880
and set foot in their each flower,

740
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,040
even if all the mass will leave,

741
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,360
this flower will go to the underworld without permission.

742
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,400
Listen to my last words,

743
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,960
promise me that

744
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,200
you'll keep your word to me.

745
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,120
Remember,

746
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,840
the core of all magic is concentration.

747
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:09,080
Concentrate, focus,

748
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,680
think about how you want to transform,

749
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,320
then concentrate your power

750
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,480
on your fingertips,

751
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,520
and think about the appearance of the Snow-Cloaked Tree.

752
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,040
Oh, no.

753
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,520
How did he become the Lord of the Deceased?

754
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,480
What is this?

755
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,600
The Lord of the Deceased

756
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,960
doesn't look the same as me.

757
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,160
Forget it.

758
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,960
Let's transform first.

759
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,200
Stop.

760
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,920
Who is making a fuss here?

761
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:41,920
I'm sorry.

762
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,800
Lord Shen Zun,

763
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,240
I didn't know it was you.

764
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:45,520
I deserve to die.

765
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,840
Yes,

766
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,720
I'm Jin Xiu now.

767
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:04,760
Lord Shen Zun.

768
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,360
Nothing.

769
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:07,320
It's nothing.

770
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,680
Lord Shen Zun,

771
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:09,840
the Heavenly Maid took some Snow-Cloaked Flower Honey

772
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,400
from the Northern Immortal Realm.

773
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,160
It's been waiting for a long time in the Flower Pavilion.

774
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,760
I wonder if you'd like to see it.

775
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:16,400
What is it?

776
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,440
Snow-Cloaked Flower Honey.

777
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,560
Great.

778
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,240
Where is it?

779
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,080
Please.

780
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:21,800
Let's go.

781
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,080
Heavenly Maid.

782
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,480
Lord Zhong Tian.

783
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,880
Heavenly Maid is so pretty.

784
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,080
So pretty.

785
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,360
You used to practice in the secluded place.

786
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,960
I didn't expect to see you today.

787
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,320
I suddenly came here

788
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,320
to disturb you.

789
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:55,600
No, no.

790
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:56,800
How can it be a disturbance?

791
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:58,000
I'm sorry.

792
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:58,920
I'm sorry.

793
00:39:58,920 --> 00:39:59,800
I'm sorry.

794
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,800
I'm sorry.

795
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:01,800
I'm sorry.

796
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,800
I'm sorry.

797
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,080
Heavenly Maid.

798
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,720
Did you bring something for me?

799
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:06,680
Where is it?

800
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,200
The Snow-Cloaked Flower Honey from the Northern Immortal Realm.

801
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:11,920
This?

802
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,160
It smells so good.

803
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,560
It smells so good.

804
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:27,480
Try it.

805
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,640
How is it?

806
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,880
It does smell good.

807
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,480
If you like this flower honey,

808
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,560
I'll bring some more next time.

809
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,000
You don't have to be so polite.

810
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,800
It won't be me next time.

811
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,480
You're much happier today.

812
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,640
Really?

813
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,120
I think so too.

814
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,600
I'm so happy.

815
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,600
I'm so happy.

816
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,600
I'm so happy.

817
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:02,840
I think so too.

818
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,080
My face used to be

819
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,040
smelly, colorless and stiff.

820
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,040
It didn't look good at all.

821
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,440
Look how beautiful it looks now.

822
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,040
Right?

823
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,080
Your Grace.

824
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,040
Heavenly Maid is inside.

825
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:33,440
Why is King Zhongtian looking at me like this?

826
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,720
I think

827
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,880
your eyebrows are really beautiful.

828
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,200
Come closer.

829
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,600
