1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm drunk.

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The you in the painting

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
is waiting for the flowers to bloom.

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The Long Ballad

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Episode 18

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Long Ballad

7
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You've violated the heaven's rules

8
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
and you're still calling me every day.

9
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Lord Shen Zun, what should I do?

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't be angry.

11
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Lord Shen Zun, what's the matter?

12
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
He's still here.

13
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
My Lord Shen Zun, you know me.

14
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm not a coward.

15
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
As long as you need me to help you...

16
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He doesn't remember me,

17
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
but he still loves me.

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I didn't say that.

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Can't we escape from destiny?

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I have something to say.

21
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
What's the first thing you said?

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Well,

23
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
compared to a beautiful encounter,

24
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
it's more difficult to meet again.

25
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You said you've used up your power.

26
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Hong Cha is still in front of you.

27
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It means...

28
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I can't repeat the same mistake.

29
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
If I accept her,

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll hurt her.

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You hurt me now.

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
No, you're just making up.

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You said everything.

34
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You're really...

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Wait.

36
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
My Lord,

37
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
how can you be sure that

38
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Hong Cha still loves you?

39
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I said,

40
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
how can you be sure that

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hong Cha still loves you?

42
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
He said,

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
he'll remember me when he sees me.

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
He said it's me all over his head.

45
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You're right.

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Yes, yes, yes.

47
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
This is the character of Hong Cha.

48
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
No.

49
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
If I accept her,

50
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll hurt her.

51
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Well, since you think so,

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
then...

53
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
But if I don't accept her,

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
it'll hurt her.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Gosh.

56
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
What a ridiculous person.

57
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You're right.

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Gosh.

59
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He said,

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
how can he be so childish

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
when he sees Hong Cha?

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
My Lord,

63
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
you said that

64
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
you don't want him to stay by your side.

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But you said,

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
where is the real Hong Cha?

67
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No, no, no.

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
No, no.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
You just interrupted me.

70
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm getting emotional.

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Don't mind me.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Forget it.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
This is not the Hua Zhao Palace.

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Right.

75
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
It's not the Hua Zhao Palace.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
What do you want to say?

77
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Go ahead.

78
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
My Lord,

79
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
this matter

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
should be started from you.

81
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Think about it.

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What did he like you

83
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
before?

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You said I'm pretty.

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Toothbrush.

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Toothbrush.

87
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Toothbrush.

88
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Toothbrush.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Well,

90
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
let's start from

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Xiang Meng.

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He likes you to be pretty.

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You can't be pretty.

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
After he experienced the story of Water Immortal,

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
he didn't miss anything.

96
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I see.

97
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Just remember to draw the painting for Water Immortal.

98
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Peach tree is beautiful and smooth.

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
The branch is in the home.

100
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
It's a family.

101
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Peach tree is beautiful and has a good foundation.

102
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
The branch is in the home.

103
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
It's a family.

104
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Peach tree is beautiful and has a good foundation.

105
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He went forward from the Master's room.

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's the dungeon.

107
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
The branch is in the home.

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's a family.

109
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Peach tree is beautiful and has a good foundation.

110
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What else did he like you?

111
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
He said

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm pretty.

113
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What's that?

114
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Why did the sword fall?

115
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
The magic is not effective.

116
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Hong Ning,

117
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
can you stop circling around me?

118
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Why do you call it circling around you?

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I'm going to learn from the Master.

120
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Since I was injured,

121
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I can't use the sword.

122
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The magic is not good.

123
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
I don't think

124
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I can teach you anything.

125
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
No, no, no.

126
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It doesn't matter.

127
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Master,

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm not going to teach you anything.

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I'm going to teach you.

130
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
It doesn't matter.

131
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I don't know anything.

132
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Even if you see the Master playing the sword,

133
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
it's okay.

134
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I'm going to follow you to practice.

135
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Does this little red tea want to be with me so much?

136
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Forget it.

137
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'll practice another day.

138
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Master, take care.

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
As long as I'm with you,

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'll definitely have a chance

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
to find the magic mirror in the dungeon.

142
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I...

143
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Hong Ning,

144
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
although you haven't become a disciple of Cang Wu yet,

145
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
but since you're here, you should be responsible for your position.

146
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
It's your responsibility

147
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
to help out the seniors.

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's your duty, too.

149
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
From today onwards,

150
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,920
From today on,

151
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,200
you'll be in charge of cleaning the whole warehouse.

152
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,440
I love cleaning the whole warehouse.

153
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,720
Just to get a glimpse of me,

154
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,800
are you willing to work so hard

155
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,240
for such a short time?

156
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,040
Of course, it's the best chance

157
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,400
to find the lemon crystal.

158
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,200
Hongming, Hongming.

159
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:57,160
How could you not think of it before?

160
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,720
Is it really destiny

161
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,880
that you want to keep it?

162
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,160
Come here.

163
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,640
Come on.

164
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:10,960
This is for you.

165
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,840
It's a little hot.

166
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,640
Give it to me.

167
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,400
It smells so good.

168
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,000
Junior,

169
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,600
let's eat.

170
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,840
Senior.

171
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:32,480
Well,

172
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
you've eaten too much recently.

173
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,920
Can't I grow taller?

174
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,240
You're already this tall.

175
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,520
Is it necessary for you to grow taller?

176
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,680
Here.

177
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:42,720
Come on.

178
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,840
Everybody continues to work together today.

179
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,160
They want to play improve.

180
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:50,920
Come on, do it.

181
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,040
Eat.

182
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,720
Why?

183
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You always

184
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,880
talk about your own problems.

185
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,320
It's a good thing.

186
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,000
But it's not easy

187
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,320
to talk about it.

188
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,960
Why are you so busy?

189
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,640
I've been sending you food every day.

190
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,080
I have to be respectful to you.

191
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,360
Talk nicely.

192
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,520
I'll feel better after eating.

193
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,320
I...

194
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,640
Fine.

195
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:38,760
Then,

196
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,600
Miss,

197
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,520
have some.

198
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,800
Your Highness,

199
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,160
Your Highness,

200
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,240
have some.

201
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,720
Thank you for taking care of me these days.

202
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,320
You've helped me.

203
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,120
Why don't you let me go

204
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,560
and be a good person?

205
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,200
Who wants to let you go?

206
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,800
You called me...

207
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,160
You called me a prostitute.

208
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,200
What's the point?

209
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,320
I...

210
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,000
I...

211
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,840
I...

212
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,040
I...

213
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:34,840
I...

214
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,560
I...

215
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,320
I...

216
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,040
I...

217
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,720
I...

218
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,440
I...

219
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,640
I want you to eat more

220
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,440
and gain weight.

221
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,360
When you hand over the food,

222
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,120
everyone will think

223
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,400
I'm a powerful monster.

224
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,120
Otherwise, why do you think

225
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,240
I'm so nice to you?

226
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,760
You haven't changed at all.

227
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,680
You're still so loveable

228
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,800
and annoying.

229
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,400
I'm sending you back.

230
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,400
Do I have to send you back

231
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:03,600
to those

232
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,000
people?

233
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,960
Who do you mean now?

234
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,520
Her spirit energy!

235
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,840
Your master has taught me beside,

236
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,880
knowing how to

237
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,520
enjoy the beauty of this life.

238
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,240
Well.

239
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,120
Mr. Jun is excellent at

240
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,680
wrong singing.

241
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,800
Watch him closely.

242
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:50,720
Mr. Jun,

243
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,760
he's actually such a widespread

244
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,640
singer.

245
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,240
He was born on He havt moulded

246
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:56,960
like those wine.

247
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:00,280
This is necessary to be a music artist.

248
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:03,880
His stage name in the musical pop corruption

249
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,200
is H 김mi.

250
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,320
Euh...

251
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,080
Why do you need master to teach you?

252
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,840
I have to be patient if I dare to leave.

253
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,080
Forget it.

254
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,000
Let me ask you.

255
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,680
Is fox a natural animal?

256
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:19,920
No.

257
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,920
Look how loyal Brother Lu Jiu is to our master.

258
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,040
What does fox like?

259
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:28,760
I don't know.

260
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,120
Why do you ask me?

261
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,600
You should ask brother fox.

262
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,400
You're right.

263
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,480
I don't know when brother fox will come back.

264
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,120
Master.

265
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,640
I'd rather die.

266
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,760
I'm guilty, master.

267
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,480
I'm guilty.

268
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,680
Master.

269
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,280
Master.

270
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,320
Are you hugging me?

271
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,240
I'm here

272
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,680
to congratulate you on your marriage with Tianyu.

273
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,640
Master.

274
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,760
I don't want to be your queen.

275
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,360
Hou Ni.

276
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,520
In the last life,

277
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:41,200
I signed a promise.

278
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,200
Is this life's reunion

279
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,960
a chance to make up for it?

280
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,160
I don't know if it's for your own good

281
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,480
or hurting you.

282
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,360
Master.

283
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,520
Master, what's wrong?

284
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,240
Nothing.

285
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,720
Just practice.

286
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,280
Master.

287
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,960
Why is your night fire injury

288
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,720
re-emerging recently?

289
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,840
It's okay.

290
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,440
Just need to be treated for a few hours.

291
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,440
Master, there's one more thing.

292
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,960
Recently, the disciples in the courtyard

293
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,800
have been discussing it.

294
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,760
I know.

295
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,840
Hongning is not a formal disciple.

296
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,200
Her foundation is too poor.

297
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:29,320
My request to her

298
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,360
is too strict.

299
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,880
Master,

300
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,280
I mean

301
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,560
all the seniors and so many disciples

302
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,000
you only taught her alone.

303
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,360
Other disciples may have some riding.

304
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,760
When in bed,

305
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,920
will sheave herself?

306
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,080
Is she still sleeping?

307
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:51,480
Hongning.

308
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,560
Why are you caressing me like a dried plum?

309
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,440
It's not so hot.

310
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,240
Not so hot or hot?

311
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,320
Just a little.

312
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,240
Scholar,

313
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,200
is it possible

314
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,640
It's not hot.

315
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,320
Maybe I'm born with a cold body.

316
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,280
I'll hold you and you can sleep.

317
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,320
It'll be cooler.

318
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,200
Come on.

319
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:08,800
No.

320
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:09,960
No.

321
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,760
I'm not afraid.

322
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,520
I'm not afraid.

323
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,640
What are you looking at?

324
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,400
The map of Cangwu I just finished.

325
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,000
The map of Cangwu?

326
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,040
You show me.

327
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,080
Here.

328
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,080
You drew it yourself?

329
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:36,720
So good.

330
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,280
Of course.

331
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,880
Don't underestimate

332
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,520
the ability and sense of the pen and paper at any time.

333
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,920
Can you give it to me?

334
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,960
I'm always lost.

335
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,320
Of course.

336
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,080
Thank you.

337
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:49,200
You're welcome.

338
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,840
Thank you.

339
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,880
You're welcome.

340
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,640
Senior Bai Ling has a pet?

341
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,680
He has a pet?

342
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,440
It's said to be a fox.

343
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,240
By the way,

344
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,400
don't tell anyone about this.

345
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,120
It's his secret.

346
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,760
I won't tell anyone.

347
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,040
Thank you.

348
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,440
You know a lot.

349
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,880
I just said

350
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,840
don't question my ability.

351
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,000
Since you think

352
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,200
I'm treated differently,

353
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,360
why don't you

354
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,440
let me live in a house?

355
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,000
So as to avoid disputes.

356
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,240
Wen Xin,

357
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,280
go and see

358
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,920
if the new bed is enough.

359
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,080
Is the firewood enough?

360
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,880
If it's not enough, go to the firewood workshop.

361
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,440
I'll go to close the coffin.

362
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,160
Well...

363
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:55,160
Huning,

364
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,640
I found that

365
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,200
Master cares about you

366
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,720
very much.

367
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,320
Really?

368
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,640
I heard from other teachers

369
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,840
that Master never teaches anyone alone.

370
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,800
But you...

371
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,320
It must be because he has been closed for years.

372
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,360
And

373
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,800
he's afraid that I'll drag him down.

374
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,360
Really?

375
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,320
Isn't it?

376
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,640
If someone

377
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,840
really cares about another person,

378
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,280
how can he not care

379
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,960
whether he eats well or lives well?

380
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,400
He only cares about his guests.

381
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,440
Anyway,

382
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,240
I just want to

383
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:32,920
sleep alone.

384
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,680
Such a big bed.

385
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,080
It's comfortable to sleep alone.

386
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,880
You're so thoughtful.

387
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,040
Huning.

388
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,480
Senior Bai Ling, why are you here?

389
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,880
Master said

390
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,600
that Huning sleeps too tight alone.

391
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,440
He wants to live in the new bedroom next door.

392
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,880
You can't talk for days.

393
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,880
I've brought the painting.

394
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,880
Go ahead.

395
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,640
Go...

396
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,680
You don't want to sleep with me?

397
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,480
Why is there such a sly fox?

398
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,120
What if he doesn't eat?

399
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,880
Do you think deuxan is good at hunting?

400
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,720
What went wrong?

401
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:48,600
George.

402
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,280
You can't say it out.

403
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,600
Meanwhile,

404
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:05,920
Bai Ling

405
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,560
doesn't want to used the incident differs from

406
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,520
what is he now.

407
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:09,040
It's because

408
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,080
they all came back first time and

409
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,880
we've found.

410
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,160
I...

411
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,200
Sorry.

412
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,240
Okay.

413
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,500
Ok

414
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,240
It's good enough

415
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,020
You can't get out

416
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:44,360
How can I be like this without you?

417
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,960
Why did I do everything wrong?

418
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,600
Why are you and Master all like this?

419
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:57,560
Forget it.

420
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,760
Let's go eat.

421
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,520
No.

422
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,720
I really don't understand you.

423
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,120
Why do you like to make things difficult for yourself?

424
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,720
You're obviously hungry,

425
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,360
but you're holding a pole and not eating.

426
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,040
You're badly injured.

427
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,320
You're thinking about going down the mountain

428
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,840
to fight with the heavenly soldiers and the heavenly soldiers.

429
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:19,920
What's wrong?

430
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,400
You're worried about your uncle's life, aren't you?

431
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,920
Uncle's life is not that important.

432
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,760
Responsibility and duties are in front of us.

433
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,200
What can we do if we're not comfortable?

434
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,640
Why is it gone?

435
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,240
First,

436
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,560
if you want to be yourself,

437
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,880
you have to love yourself first.

438
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,720
Then you can take on the responsibility

439
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,560
and the possibilities of the duties.

440
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,520
And this feeling of discomfort

441
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,120
has nothing to do with the fact that he's a demon.

442
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
You have to be true to yourself

443
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,600
to make him feel comfortable.

444
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,960
If I didn't hear it myself,

445
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,040
I wouldn't believe that you said that.

446
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,280
You've got many advantages.

447
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:09,720
Take your time.

448
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,680
Take your time.

449
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,400
Just take your time.

450
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,520
Exactly.

451
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,040
What're you waiting for?

452
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,120
Time to eat.

453
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,760
Go to eat?

454
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,780
Is it your spirit energy or rabbit energy?

455
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,080
I'm your fairy,

456
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,280
but you're a demon.

457
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,240
How could you let her go easily?

458
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,840
But I'll give her what I love, okay?

459
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
I'll give it to you.

460
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,000
In the future,

461
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,840
when I really need it,

462
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:51,960
give it to me.

463
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,240
Okay.

464
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,560
I'll give it to you.

465
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,560
Isn't it good

466
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:45,600
to be quiet?

467
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:08,680
Xi Kan,

468
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,200
you're not noisy, are you?

469
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,680
When you're bored,

470
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,520
you'll gain a sense of enjoyable bone- Aye,

471
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:19,760
I'm fine with that,

472
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:22,320
but I don't suffer a proper Regional election

473
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,760
to render a vote.

474
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,200
I'd rather pick a map

475
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,640
that makes their temperature fluctuate all day.

476
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,240
10 y.o.

477
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,140
I don't see him today.

478
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,720
I heard that he is off- fixed today.

479
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,440
He'll be dismissed soon.

480
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,520
Off- indeed?

481
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:48,980
Yep.

482
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,480
I heard he was badly injured.

483
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,440
I haven't done my research.

484
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,800
What I know is

485
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,140
the Martial Master Lu Jiu is an conseguent demon.

486
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,220
I've been following Master

487
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,980
and loyal to him.

488
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,940
Then why haven't I seen

489
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:02,940
Brother Luo Jiu?

490
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,260
I heard that

491
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,140
he was sent by Master

492
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:08,140
to complete a special task

493
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,540
that hasn't been completed yet.

494
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,340
I'll go over first.

495
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,740
Brother Wuli.

496
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:22,900
You're back.

497
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,660
You're back.

498
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,660
If I see you

499
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,100
sleeping in a lazy way,

500
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,380
I'll throw you into the single stove.

501
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,300
Do you know

502
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,180
that you'll get into trouble

503
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,260
when you're on duty?

504
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,260
That's so dangerous.

505
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:41,580
Come on.

506
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,860
Let's have a drink.

507
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,260
Master.

508
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,340
What are they doing?

509
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:54,220
It's so noisy.

510
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,140
I don't know what to do.

511
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,300
Come on.

512
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,420
Sister.

513
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:11,060
This is the first chess piece

514
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,940
that I've been researching for a long time.

515
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,060
There's only one piece in the world.

516
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,420
Whoever meets it will be in trouble.

517
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,460
Master.

518
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,100
Master.

519
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,060
No.

520
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,020
Brother Wuli is back.

521
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,020
Hello, Brother Wuli.

522
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,500
Brother Luo Jiu is back.

523
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,900
Brother Luo Jiu.

524
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:00,980
Brother Luo Jiu.

525
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,300
What's wrong with you?

526
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,500
Why are you here again?

527
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,580
Actually, I'm here

528
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,220
to ask you a question.

529
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,620
You foxes

530
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,380
don't like to eat anything except rabbits.

531
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,660
Cat, rabbit,

532
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,220
or mouse?

533
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:16,980
Get out.

534
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,660
Tell me.

535
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,180
What's your hobby?

536
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,420
For example,

537
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,140
climbing a tree,

538
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,060
making a hole,

539
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:25,980
or rolling a horse.

540
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:31,060
Get out.

541
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,580
Why are you still so angry?

542
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,260
I have another thing.

543
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,980
There's a goose feather in your room.

544
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,300
I took it to Hongning

545
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,540
as Master said.

546
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,820
I didn't steal it.

547
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,260
Although I don't know

548
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,300
what Master is in trouble for.

549
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,060
Never mind.

550
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,820
But it doesn't matter.

551
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,020
I'll go to Master.

552
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,380
You can do it.

553
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:53,980
Come on.

554
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,860
Hongning.

555
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:08,700
Hongning.

556
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,740
Master, are you there?

557
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,220
Master.

558
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:18,820
Come in.

559
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,500
Master,

560
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,580
I'm closed.

561
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,580
What do you think?

562
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:30,460
Well,

563
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,700
I need to tell you something.

564
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,980
What do you think

565
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,380
that I've lost

566
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,700
for hundreds of years since Establish the texture of stone?

567
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,140
You know what I'm gonna say.

568
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,580
Let me tell you,

569
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,700
that's the thing.

570
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:46,740
I picked it up

571
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,660
after I walked down the mountain.

572
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,980
If I pass clock hands,

573
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,260
I'll kill it with my hands,

574
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,740
I went down the mountain to catch the demon

575
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,740
and met a fairy grass fairy with ten thousand years of spiritual power.

576
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,380
The fairy grass fairy was turned into a human shape and was selling food.

577
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,100
I didn't recognize it at first sight.

578
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:03,740
I saw her pitiful and bought a medicine for soup there.

579
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,940
But who would have thought

580
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,340
that there were so many of you in the medicine for soup.

581
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,500
So I lost two hundred years of spiritual power.

582
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,380
After that,

583
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,700
I fought with her for three days and three nights.

584
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,780
That's the story.

585
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,900
What does the fairy grass fairy look like?

586
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,540
The fairy grass fairy...

587
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:24,980
The fairy grass fairy...

588
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,220
The fairy grass fairy...

589
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,860
After she became a human shape,

590
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,660
she had a long and strong body.

591
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,540
She had a pair of huge wings.

592
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,100
She was as strong as a white goose.

593
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,180
Her body was as strong as a black bear.

594
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,500
Didn't you tell me that

595
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,580
you were married that day?

596
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:45,940
Yes.

597
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:48,740
The village chief...

598
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,300
He is...

599
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:50,980
Enough.

600
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:52,540
Stop making up stories.

601
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,100
Tell me.

602
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,340
Master,

603
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,980
I'll be honest with you.

604
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,860
The so-called poor white rabbit

605
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,340
is wandering in the east and west.

606
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,500
He is as good as a human.

607
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,860
Close the door when you go out.

608
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,340
Master,

609
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,660
I just want to say that

610
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,980
you are so nice to your new junior brother.

611
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,660
Can you be nicer to me?

612
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,100
Tell me.

613
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,820
What do you want as your materials?

614
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:29,780
In fact, I just want to ask you for some money.

615
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,720
Being authentic

616
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,060
has made you want things like this.

617
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:35,700
Why did I go to the mountains to unlock the drug?

618
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,620
Master,

619
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,660
you weren't Changshuo in the past.

620
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:43,740
Cultivating to become a dtie should be displayed well and learnwise.

621
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:46,780
He's good for the body, so he should be advanced in order to be good for others.

622
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,780
As a mortal,

623
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,060
You're at your age.

624
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:51,820
It's the year of the weak.

625
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,820
How can you ask me for money?

626
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:54,980
But no one in our house

627
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,900
taught me how to make money.

628
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,060
Back then, your uncle Wenxin

629
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,660
taught you how to practice chess.

630
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,420
I want some money to make the little fox happy.

631
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,940
Why is it so hard to make him happy?

632
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,660
Why are you here?

633
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:29,940
Why?

634
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,980
Why?

635
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,140
Why?

636
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,180
What do you mean why?

637
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,860
How did you hide from my caretaker?

638
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:38,820
I hid from you?

639
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:39,780
No.

640
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:40,980
Don't tell me.

641
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,460
I don't want to know.

642
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,820
There's no reason.

643
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:44,820
Oh.

644
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,820
You...

645
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,060
You know me?

646
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:49,980
I...

647
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,980
I don't know you.

648
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,180
I've never seen you.

649
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:52,820
Then...

650
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,980
I didn't...

651
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,340
I didn't see you.

652
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,020
Brother.

653
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:04,340
What...

654
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,260
What are you doing?

655
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,740
I'm useless.

656
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,300
I'm a loser.

657
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:11,620
I'm a loser.

658
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,980
I'm a loser.

659
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,820
I'm a loser.

660
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,660
Who are these people in the library?

661
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,540
Oh, no.

662
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,580
My lemon.

663
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:29,900
Master.

664
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,020
I'm sorry.

665
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,140
It's my fault.

666
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:35,620
I let Hongning meet you again.

667
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,540
Don't worry.

668
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,700
I'll try my best to drive her away.

669
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,700
No need.

670
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,020
Master.

671
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:49,420
I...

672
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,220
Didn't you say

673
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,820
not to let her get close to the warehouse?

674
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,780
In the warehouse,

675
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,140
the monster is very dangerous.

676
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,740
She's also focused on cultivation.

677
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,780
If I force her to leave,

678
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,900
it will hinder her cultivation.

679
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,340
But if she's here,

680
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,100
it will affect your cultivation.

681
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,180
No wonder you forced her to leave

682
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,060
and you were interrupted.

683
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:19,540
So these are all because of me.

684
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,180
Master.

685
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,820
I'm sorry.

686
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,500
Lu Jiu.

687
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,500
Keep crying.

688
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,180
Master.

689
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,500
I'm sorry.

690
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:34,660
It's all my fault.

691
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,660
I'm sorry.

692
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:37,820
Come on.

693
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,620
Next time you go down the mountain,

694
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,020
remember to buy more wind-sand and elixir.

695
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,820
Remember these things.

696
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,300
Don't run out of money.

697
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,060
That's all?

698
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,140
Junior.

699
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,820
You're short of money.

700
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,060
Do you have more?

701
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,220
No.

702
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:53,980
I really don't have any.

703
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,140
Shut up if you don't have any.

704
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:56,740
Bai Ling.

705
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:59,940
Did you owe Dong Zhai when you went down the mountain?

706
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,540
Of course not.

707
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,420
I went down the mountain to catch the monster.

708
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,340
I won't do these things.

709
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:06,740
Why are you short of money?

710
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,220
Besides,

711
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:11,180
you can't just point at us poor people.

712
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,700
We haveonto cheat you.

713
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:27,340
That kid Adele is so차� forgot that she has to go to that mountain to meet someone.

714
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:28,900
Know what,

715
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,580
look at that guy.

716
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,180
Yesterday, Master

717
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,480
made her live in IV-line ayurvedic care.

718
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:35,500
Also ordered someone to prepare her firmware,

719
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:36,940
personal pillow and so on.

720
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,300
Can she't pay off each of them?

721
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:40,780
It's unreasonable.

722
00:37:40,780 --> 00:38:01,340
You're the urgent update for the

723
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,580
One, two, three, four,

724
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:06,780
mora.

725
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,820
Will I die?

726
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,380
Sit down.

727
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:11,940
Thank you.

728
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:12,980
Where should I send her?

729
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,420
I...

730
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:19,860
Hongning,

731
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:20,820
you're back.

732
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,660
These are the clothes of me and my seniors.

733
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:24,820
Help me wash them.

734
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:25,300
I...

735
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:26,660
I hurt my hand

736
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:27,780
when I practiced this morning.

737
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,380
It hurts.

738
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:29,340
I just...

739
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,300
I'll leave now.

740
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:41,940
Wait.

741
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:55,980
Hold tight.

742
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,180
Okay.

743
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:13,440
I...

744
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,820
My text has become much lighter.

745
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:23,580
Do you need any tips?

746
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,100
I want to share with you.

747
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,100
For you,

748
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,460
I can add everything.

749
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:29,700
Thanks Beile Few.

750
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,720
I feel like a midwifway person.

751
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,980
He's a noob but facehehe...

752
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,660
you don't need to worry.

753
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,520
It's very simple.

754
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,520
They are tall and strong.

755
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,960
They consume more than me.

756
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,760
It's normal that they eat more than me.

757
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,120
If I fight with them

758
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,640
because of this,

759
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,640
I will only be a thorn in their eye.

760
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,720
If I want them to accept me,

761
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,640
I have to let their mother find out my good side.

762
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,640
I didn't expect

763
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,040
you were so fierce at such a young age.

764
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,240
When I was young,

765
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,320
I was often bullied by people in the village.

766
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:04,800
Later,

767
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,000
they all became friends with me.

768
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,720
But the most important thing is

769
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,200
how to become

770
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,800
the official disciple of Cang Wushan.

771
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,160
That's the most important thing.

772
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,520
If you say so,

773
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,400
you shouldn't mind.

774
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,760
I'll stay away from you.

775
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:40,800
Come on.

776
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,040
This junior is so naughty.

777
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,760
I can't bear to bully him.

778
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,320
It's boring.

779
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,000
Yes.

780
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,160
I washed his dirty clothes a few days ago.

781
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,880
He didn't wash them.

782
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,520
He even fixed the hole on his clothes.

783
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:53,880
Really?

784
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,920
Yes.

785
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,200
He is hardworking and talented.

786
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,280
I think

787
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,000
he will be a disciple of Cang Wushan.

788
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,320
It makes sense.

789
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,480
Although Master favors him,

790
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,200
he never shows his favor to others.

791
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,400
This won't do.

792
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:07,800
We have to think of a way.

793
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,400
Right.

794
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,000
The bell....

795
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:18,920
You won track him.

796
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,360
Right.

797
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,400
How should I guess?

798
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,480
Just bite it.

799
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,400
I'm sure

800
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,760
you've heard from three rules of unusual flexible以 法神.

801
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,520
The first is收邀.

802
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,400
A second is De Fa Qi.

803
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,320
The mission of the two of them

804
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,560
is to find the Nine-Night Spirit Charm

805
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,240
in the woods behind Cangwu Mountain.

806
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,880
Nine-Night Spirit Charm?

807
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,920
It's the same as the legend of Nine-Turned Deity Pill.

808
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,400
It has the effect of bringing back the dead.

809
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,880
Even if the soul leaves the body,

810
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:51,800
it can save people from the hell.

811
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,640
You're right.

812
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,800
Then if I find the Nine-Night Spirit Charm,

813
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,440
can I become a disciple of Cangwu Mountain?

814
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,600
Of course.

815
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,640
Then if I become a disciple of Cangwu Mountain,

816
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,280
can I go around

817
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,720
the whole Cangwu Mountain?

818
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:05,960
Of course.

819
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,920
Wait, Senior.

820
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,080
I heard that

821
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,080
there are many monsters and beasts in the woods.

822
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:11,840
It's okay.

823
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,360
Cangwu Mountain is a sacred mountain.

824
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,360
Even if there are monsters,

825
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,960
it's a sacred place.

826
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:18,080
Come on.

827
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,960
This is the pass-on talisman of you two.

828
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,160
You two can use it together.

829
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,240
If you're in danger,

830
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:24,560
you can tell me anytime.

831
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,880
Actually, you don't have to worry.

832
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,680
This is just a chance

833
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:29,880
for you to become disciples.

834
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,080
I got it.

835
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,240
Senior, I think

836
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,560
according to my current fate,

837
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,880
I can't find the Nine-Night Spirit Charm.

838
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,720
You're quite smart.

839
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,200
Thank you, Senior.

840
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:48,240
Okay, go back.

841
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,440
Really?

842
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:51,880
Thank you, Senior.

843
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,840
Is Hong Ning in danger?

844
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,040
What danger can she be in?

845
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:58,240
I'm here, right?

846
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,320
You don't believe me?

847
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,160
I'm here.

848
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:01,000
I'm here.

849
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:01,760
I'm here.

850
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,480
I'm here.

851
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,240
I'm here.

852
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,000
I'm here.

853
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:04,720
I'm here.

854
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:05,520
I'm here.

855
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,360
I'm here.

856
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,200
You don't believe me?

857
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,480
You're right.

858
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:09,720
I'll go back then.

859
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,400
Go.

860
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,760
This is the result of you stealing my title.

861
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,120
Do you remember the day

862
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,080
when we were happy together?

863
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:44,880
When the flowers bloom,

864
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,080
I'll write down my wish in my heart.

865
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:51,400
I'll accompany you to watch the wind and rain

866
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:55,800
in the end of the world.

867
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:02,120
Please change your name for the rest of your life.

868
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,920
Do you remember the day

869
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:07,920
when we were happy together?

870
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,640
When the flowers bloom,

871
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,920
I'll write down my wish in my heart.

872
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,200
I'll accompany you to watch the wind and rain

873
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:21,600
in the end of the world.

874
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:28,000
I'll follow you through the crowds.

875
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:34,280
Can you hear the sound of the drum in your heart?

876
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,280
Even if time is merciless,

877
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,160
we will never forget each other.

878
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,800
We will spend our lives

879
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:48,840
enjoying each other's company.
