1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:14,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
The world is divided into three worlds, the immortals, the demons and humans

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
The immortals are divided into the west sea and the north sea

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The Lord of the West Sea is the ruler of the world

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
The immortals in the west sea and the north sea hope to be friends with Zhong Tian

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,000
and get a higher position

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The Lord of the West Sea is here

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Zhong Tianli, the second season of the 8,3000 years

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Yao Tian ascended the throne and took the throne

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
At the same year, the Heavenly Empress Yi He gave birth to the twin sons

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The brothers Jin Xiu and Kun Lun

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The officials are happy

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
This also indicates that Zhong Tian can last for thousands of years

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Congratulations, Your Majesty

16
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Congratulations, Your Majesty

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
In theory

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The stars represented by the two princes

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The one who shines first is the Star of Heaven and Earth

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The star of heaven and earth is the master of Zhong Tian in the future

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But who would have thought that the two stars would shine at the same time

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
It's really unheard of

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Your Majesty, I'm afraid it's hard to predict

24
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
But I think

25
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Your Majesty has already made arrangements

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Brother Jin Xiu was raised by the successor of Zhong Tian

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He was ordered to guard the heavenly rules and be gentle

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The only tenderness comes from the red tea flower that grew up with him

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
When will you bloom

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You are red tea, I am peony

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
We are the same origin

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
From now on, I will take care of you

33
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000

Let's start with this red tea flower

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,520
The flowers could only bloom

64
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:51,180
and asshole by the해요

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,480
God of Flower is practicing in the Middle Heaven.

66
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,200
I'm not lying to you. I'm not lying to you.

67
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,000
How about...how about...how about...

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,320
Kuliu Sword.

69
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,320
How about...

70
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,720
You should go back and practice.

71
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,960
My brother just took the position of God of Flower.

72
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,480
I just came to see him.

73
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:37,760
Why are you pushing me?

74
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,600
No, I didn't mean that.

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Open the flower.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Xu Huan.

77
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Kuliu Sword.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I can't do this.

79
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
God of Flower can only be used by God of Flower.

80
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
This will affect the flowering and flowering of the mortal world.

81
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You're using it so carelessly.

82
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Something big will happen.

83
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Listen to me.

84
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Give it to me.

85
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Immortal Ju.

86
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
My brother doesn't care about me.

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Why should you care about me?

88
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Besides, what can happen to Kuliu Flower?

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't stay with my brother for too long.

90
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
You'll become as boring as him.

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Open the flower.

92
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Can't you hear me?

93
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
A little red tea flower

94
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
can't even listen to the God of Flower.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I'll make you a punishment.

96
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Brother.

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Brother, I'm sorry.

98
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Put me down, brother.

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I...

100
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
God of Woman.

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Zhong Tian Ji will send someone soon.

102
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm sorry.

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Brother.

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You're not a human.

106
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
You're a human.

107
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You're a human.

108
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Zhong Tian Ji will send someone soon

109
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
to make a wish for the flowering and flowering of the mortal world.

110
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Don't take the responsibility for Kulun God this time.

111
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's okay.

112
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
He's always a joke.

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You're a coward.

114
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Immortal Ju.

115
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Look.

116
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
This red tea flower really listens to you.

117
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Kulun God just took the flower god's order.

118
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Look, all the flowers have bloomed.

119
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
He's the only one who can't move.

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Little red tea.

121
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
The flower god's order commands the three plants.

122
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's like seeing the flower god.

123
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Are you doing this for me?

124
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Don't you even care about the order?

125
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
Master Jinxiu.

126
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You're in charge of the loss of the flower god's order.

127
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The mortal world is in a mess.

128
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
The emperor is calling you to Zhong Tian Hall.

129
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Kulun God used the flower god's order first.

130
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You're in charge of the loss of the flower god's order.

131
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You should follow the order.

132
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Yes.

133
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Besides, the tea flower defends the flower god's order.

134
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
It should be punished.

135
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Father.

136
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
This red tea flower recognized that the order to use the flower god's order was not mine.

137
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
That's why it defends the flower god's order.

138
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
This tea flower has always been

139
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
the owner of your loss of the lotus seed.

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Yes.

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
This red tea flower has always been my child.

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I don't know why I feel so close every time I see it.

143
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I once told you

144
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
to be free from love and hate.

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Only then can you have a good reputation.

146
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
If you have a heart to entrust,

147
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
you can't be a qualified judge.

148
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I thought you would have some shame.

149
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
But I didn't expect

150
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
you would not only be deaf to the warning,

151
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
but also be too hard on yourself.

152
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
You're deliberately thinking too much.

153
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Father, I didn't mean to think too much.

154
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I'm the only one to blame for this.

155
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
If you want to punish me, then punish me.

156
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I'm going to let you know today

157
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:06,000
how to destroy others' love and pity.

158
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Father.

159
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Pass my order.

160
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Yes.

161
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Red tea is against the god's order.

162
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
It's against the law of nature.

163
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Cut off the fairy's abode and destroy it.

164
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Yes.

165
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You must always remember

166
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
that the fairy's spirit is respected and the heaven and earth have laws.

167
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
If you can't do it,

168
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,000
even if you have a fairy's spirit, you must kill it.

169
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Only in this way can you stand on the end of the three realms

170
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
and maintain the order of the four seas and eight deserts.

171
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You didn't do anything,

172
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
but because I cut off the fairy's abode,

173
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
you're innocent.

174
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Your life is made up of red tea flowers.

175
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
In the future,

176
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
you can be Hong Ning.

177
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm going to kill you.

178
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm going to kill you.

179
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I'm going to kill you.

180
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm going to kill you.

181
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'm going to kill you.

182
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm going to kill you.

183
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,000
You can be Hong Ning.

184
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
The heaven and earth are not suitable for you.

185
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I hope you can live happily after you die.

186
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I hope one day,

187
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
we will meet again.

188
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
You're fine.

189
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
You're fine.

190
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Who are you?

191
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Where are you from?

192
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
Heaven.

193
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Heaven.

194
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Heaven?

195
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You're not Hong Ning.

196
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
500 years later,

197
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
the world is in a terrible state.

198
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
The city is in the winter.

199
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
The flowers are not blooming.

200
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
There is no spring in the world.

201
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
The monster can't escape from the heaven.

202
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
The monster can't escape from the heaven.

203
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
The monster can't escape from the heaven.

204
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Hong Ning,

205
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
your first thunder is coming.

206
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You should hide.

207
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Be careful.

208
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
The heaven is coming.

209
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Go.

210
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Hong Ning.

211
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
How long?

212
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
There are still three more.

213
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,680
To the drop.

214
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,440
Baddie!

215
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,080
You must go across the next building.

216
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,560
It's all yours now.

217
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,880
It's youruck if you shrimp it in the end.

218
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,160
All right now.

219
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,520
Do your best.

220
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,760
greatly

221
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,440
Great job.

222
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,440
It's so high.

223
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,440
It's so heavy.

224
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:26,880
It smells so good.

225
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,120
It's so good.

226
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,120
Qiao'er.

227
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
Let's go.

228
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,520
Let's go.

229
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,520
Let's go.

230
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,120
Hongniang.

231
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,320
It's been 500 years.

232
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
You're finally married.

233
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,640
But the weather in Mount Baizhou is too heavy.

234
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,440
You don't know yet.

235
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,720
Mount Baizhou

236
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:49,800
is always full of monsters.

237
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
The weather is naturally heavy.

238
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,800
But it's okay.

239
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
I've become human now.

240
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,800
Thank you for helping me.

241
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Yes.

242
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,800
You're welcome.

243
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
But when I was a human,

244
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,800
the weather was so heavy.

245
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,800
When I was a fairy,

246
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,800
Wait.

247
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Fairy?

248
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
You want to be a fairy?

249
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:11,800
You're so stupid.

250
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,800
You must have been hit by thunder.

251
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,800
No.

252
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,800
But since Mount Baizhou,

253
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,800
there has been no god.

254
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,880
I've never seen a god here.

255
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
Do you remember?

256
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:21,880
I remember

257
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,880
the white tea monster

258
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
at the hill next door.

259
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,880
When I was a fairy,

260
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
I was so strong.

261
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
No one could see me.

262
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,880
But after I went to heaven,

263
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,880
I was always cheated.

264
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,880
You know

265
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,880
I've been a fairy for so long

266
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,880
just to be able to go to heaven

267
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,960
and to repay my god.

268
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,960
Reward?

269
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,960
Reward?

270
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,960
Reward.

271
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,960
You don't understand.

272
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,960
You just made a human shape.

273
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
Who told you to tell her

274
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,960
the story of the white bear?

275
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
I didn't just tell her this.

276
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,960
I also told her

277
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
the story of the dog bear.

278
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,960
The white bear is grateful.

279
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
The monkey is grateful.

280
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
The white rabbit is grateful.

281
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,960
Right, Hongning?

282
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
Yes.

283
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,960
It's not just the story of the fairy.

284
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
Hongning.

285
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,960
There are so many flowers in the sky.

286
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,960
Do you know which one to hug?

287
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,040
Of course I know.

288
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,040
When I was very very very small

289
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,040
and very small.

290
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,040
I saw it in the gap.

291
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:24,040
There is a flower leaf here.

292
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,040
I will never forget it.

293
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
Okay.

294
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,040
Let's talk about the security later.

295
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,040
I want to tell you

296
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,040
how dare you go to the mountain

297
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,040
to pick flowers two days ago?

298
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,040
You don't know

299
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,040
that flowers are not allowed in the world now.

300
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,040
Mom, I'm so cold.

301
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,040
Hold on.

302
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
When spring comes,

303
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:51,040
everything will be fine.

304
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
Mom,

305
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,040
can I never see spring again?

306
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,040
It's my fault.

307
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,040
I shouldn't have brought you

308
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,040
into this world.

309
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,040
Mom, look.

310
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
Flowers.

311
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,040
Flowers.

312
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
Flowers.

313
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:10,040
Flowers are blooming.

314
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
Flowers are blooming.

315
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,120
Spring is coming.

316
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,120
Why can't they bloom?

317
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,120
Isn't it the mission of a flower to bloom?

318
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,120
Is the mission that important?

319
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,120
Ten years of winter is a punishment to the frost.

320
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,120
But that pair of mother and daughter are very poor.

321
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,120
What can I do if I bloom?

322
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,120
You don't care.

323
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,120
Go, go, go.

324
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,120
Hongning.

325
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,120
Hongning.

326
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,120
Who knows if they will be guilty.

327
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
But

328
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
there are monsters here

329
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,200
for three days and two nights.

330
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
They can't control it even if they want to.

331
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:45,200
By the way, Hongning.

332
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,200
For the sake of safety,

333
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,200
you'd better hide here

334
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,200
and avoid them.

335
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,200
Is it okay to hide?

336
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,200
What are you afraid of?

337
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
Don't be afraid.

338
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Even if there are monsters,

339
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,200
if he comes,

340
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
he can't get past us.

341
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
Okay, Hongning.

342
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Do whatever you want.

343
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,200
We'll be here.

344
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
By the way, Hongning.

345
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,200
I just picked a leaf.

346
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,200
It's fresh.

347
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,200
By the way,

348
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,200
I'm so shy.

349
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,200
After I wake up,

350
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
I'll give you a pearl.

351
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Thank you.

352
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
Yes, yours.

353
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,200
I'm not mature yet.

354
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,200
I'll give it to you when I'm mature.

355
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,200
Then remember it.

356
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,200
I remember.

357
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
Thank you.

358
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,200
How dare you?

359
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,200
You were a god.

360
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
You were punished by the Heaven's rule.

361
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
But you never regret it

362
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,280
and hurt my heavenly soldiers.

363
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
Today,

364
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,280
I'll punish you.

365
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,280
I've heard that Master

366
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,280
is really powerful

367
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,280
in the cultivation of the sea of the sea.

368
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,280
He actually cured this evil demon.

369
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,360
I wonder if he'll hurt people again in the future.

370
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
No.

371
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,360
He'll be destroyed

372
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,360
once he enters the Qi Lin Cave.

373
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:45,360
Yes.

374
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,360
I'll go tell the doctor now.

375
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,360
Master.

376
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:59,360
Near the Mount Baizhou,

377
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,360
I found the red tea flower demon

378
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,360
that was opened in the mortal world.

379
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,360
It's a flower.

380
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,360
It's a flower.

381
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,360
It's a flower.

382
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:09,360
It's a flower.

383
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,360
It's a flower.

384
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,360
It's a flower.

385
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,360
It's a flower.

386
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,360
It's a flower.

387
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,360
It's a flower.

388
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,360
It's a flower.

389
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,360
It's a flower.

390
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,360
It's a flower.

391
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,360
It's a flower.

392
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,360
It's a flower.

393
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,360
It's a flower.

394
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,360
It's a flower.

395
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,360
It's a flower.

396
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,360
It's a flower.

397
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
It's a flower.

398
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,360
It's a flower.

399
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:26,360
It's a flower.

400
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,360
It's a flower.

401
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,360
It's a flower.

402
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
It's a flower.

403
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,360
It's a flower.

404
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,360
It's a flower.

405
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,360
It's a flower.

406
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
It's a flower.

407
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,360
It's a flower.

408
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,900
Tomorrow is Night specifically.

409
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,900
Let trouble come to us later.

410
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:48,060
Tomorrow is Night particularly.

411
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,260
Let trouble come to us later.

412
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,960
They say

413
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,000
cultivation can build bread,

414
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
and God can send us Josephine.

415
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,560
Seems like it justsky

416
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,360
Tea flowers demon

417
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,860
Could it be answering rare

418
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,320
You are looking for me?

419
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,280
I don't care if the flowers are open or not.

420
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,480
According to the law,

421
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,200
you should be punished by a hundred thunders.

422
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,360
You are here to catch me.

423
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,560
Don't do anything pointless.

424
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,040
You are a member of the Flower Tribe.

425
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,600
You should know that

426
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:09,200
the flowers in the world can only be opened when you receive the flowers.

427
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,760
Since you broke the heaven rule, you should be punished by the heaven.

428
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,600
But...

429
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,400
But there are no flowers here for ten years.

430
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,320
The heaven and earth punish the evil and the ugly.

431
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,560
You won't have the fortune to receive the flowers in ten years.

432
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,120
But the people here are innocent.

433
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,000
The flowers have been open for ten years.

434
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,600
If the flowers are not opened,

435
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,280
they won't see the spring.

436
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:50,160
If they don't see the spring, they will have no hope.

437
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,120
They will be desperate.

438
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,720
This is the heaven law.

439
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,760
The heaven law?

440
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,200
The heaven law is nothing to you immortals.

441
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,920
But to mortals,

442
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,360
it's a lifetime.

443
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,640
It's not fair.

444
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:08,320
Fair?

445
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,600
Fair means you should be punished.

446
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,080
Since you made a mistake, you should be punished.

447
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,800
You should be punished by thunder.

448
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,280
But you have a ridiculous mind.

449
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,840
You don't have the right way to practice.

450
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,880
You might go to the wrong way.

451
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,720
Today,

452
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,920
I accepted your internal order.

453
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,360
So you won't do evil again.

454
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,600
Father.

455
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,360
I will show you

456
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,680
how to destroy others' love and pity.

457
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,720
Today, I will give you the fruit of the branch.

458
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:08,000
You can be Hongning in the future.

459
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,040
The heavenly realm is not for you.

460
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,480
I hope you can have a good rest in the lower realm.

461
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:14,920
Hongning.

462
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,200
You...

463
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,600
You know me?

464
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,080
Why can't I recognize your name?

465
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:33,800
Huh?

466
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,600
You should have been born to die.

467
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,960
You have been cultivating for 500 years.

468
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,560
You finally become a human.

469
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,560
Why do you not cherish it?

470
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,360
I... I'm sorry.

471
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,680
It's my fault.

472
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,800
I shouldn't have done that.

473
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,880
Don't kill me, okay?

474
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,520
I have to go to heaven.

475
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,160
She drifted away because of me

476
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,680
to the place where the poison was accumulated.

477
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,800
If I give her another chance to cultivate,

478
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,640
you want to go to heaven?

479
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:08,880
Yes.

480
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,640
I have cultivated for 500 years

481
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,080
just to go to heaven.

482
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,720
You were born in Mount Baizhou,

483
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,160
but you still want to cultivate and go to heaven.

484
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,240
You have some ambition.

485
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:23,960
Can you promise me

486
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,800
that you won't leave the Flower Realm after you go to heaven?

487
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,920
I promise.

488
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,160
I promise everything.

489
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,600
I promise everything you do.

490
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,160
Since you have said that,

491
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,000
I will give you this chance

492
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,760
to go to heaven and suffer the rest.

493
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,120
Really?

494
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,080
Are you happy?

495
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,520
If I knew it, I would...

496
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,920
It's nothing.

497
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,360
Thank you for punishing me.

498
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,520
Ridiculous.

499
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,040
Let's go.

500
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,560
No, no, no.

501
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,760
Wait for me.

502
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,440
I have two more good friends.

503
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,760
Lemon Green and Jiao Bo.

504
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,960
I will go with you.

505
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,760
I have two good friends, Lemon Green and Jiao Bo.

506
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,240
I will say goodbye to them

507
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,520
and have a meal before I go.

508
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,520
What's wrong?

509
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,520
What's the brand of the Bantua Flower?

510
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,040
The Golden Lotus of Nine Pills, please accept the flower.

511
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,680
Thank you.

512
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,680
Go to the Flower Pavilion.

513
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,280
Thank you.

514
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,280
You are the master.

515
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,560
You go to the Flower Pavilion, too.

516
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,360
Thank you.

517
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,080
There's more.

518
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,280
No one else.

519
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,280
It's so cold.

520
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,280
It's so cold.

521
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,280
It's so cold.

522
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,280
It's so cold.

523
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,280
It's so cold.

524
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,280
It's so cold.

525
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,520
The third season of the Bantua Flower Pavilion,

526
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,520
the Nine Pills of Heaven and Earth,

527
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,800
before the Flower Pavilion,

528
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,280
the red tea demon of Mount Baizhou

529
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,880
doesn't care about flowers,

530
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,320
but flowers are blooming.

531
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,480
I'll write it down for him.

532
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,040
Immortal.

533
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:13,560
Don't pull me.

534
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,560
I haven't finished writing it.

535
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,800
No, Immortal.

536
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,440
Don't pull me.

537
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,080
I told you I haven't finished writing it.

538
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:18,880
How can you finish writing

539
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,880
so many bad things?

540
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
But Immortal, look.

541
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,400
What are you doing,

542
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,440
Immortal?

543
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,840
Immortal.

544
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:34,240
Immortal.

545
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,440
Why are you back so soon?

546
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,000
This is the Heavenly Palace?

547
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,200
You are all flowers?

548
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:52,840
Immortal.

549
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,240
This little fairy is...

550
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,360
The red tea demon who was punished

551
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,920
made her suffer 97 thunder.

552
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,120
Wait.

553
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,280
Wait.

554
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,680
Immortal.

555
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,600
She is the red tea demon.

556
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,120
Demon.

557
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,720
The red tea flower demon.

558
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,640
You are a demon?

559
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:09,600
Yes.

560
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,440
What did you teach me?

561
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:12,920
I...

562
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:13,880
Well...

563
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,040
Immortal, let's talk.

564
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:15,880
Let's talk.

565
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,240
Immortal.

566
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,360
Immortal.

567
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:25,640
Why did you bring the demon

568
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,880
to the Heaven?

569
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:27,840
No way.

570
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,760
She doesn't care about flowers.

571
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,840
She is blooming without permission.

572
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,480
She deserves to be punished.

573
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,360
The red tea flower demon

574
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,760
has no limits.

575
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,200
She is so beautiful.

576
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,120
Look.

577
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,160
She is so beautiful.

578
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,240
She is so beautiful.

579
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:43,640
Yes.

580
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,640
She has no limits.

581
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,200
Let her stay here.

582
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,160
No way.

583
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,120
There is no such fairy in the Heavenly Palace.

584
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,200
No way.

585
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,320
Absolutely no way.

586
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,760
What else?

587
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,040
Such an excellent Immortal.

588
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:01,320
She can't be solved.

589
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,640
Immortal.

590
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,160
I am so excellent

591
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,480
as you said.

592
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,200
I am so excellent.

593
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,400
She left.

594
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:31,760
She left.

595
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,480
She left.

596
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,800
You are not only a demon,

597
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,000
but also a demon of Mount Baizhou.

598
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,600
Right?

599
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,920
The demon of Mount Baizhou is so famous.

600
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,560
Of course.

601
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,640
No one knows it.

602
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,520
A demon.

603
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,360
Look.

604
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,360
Well.

605
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,800
There are three choices.

606
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:56,800
The first one.

607
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,520
Be quick-witted.

608
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,560
The second one.

609
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:00,800
Three times a month.

610
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,800
Be quick-witted.

611
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,960
The third one.

612
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,320
One day a month.

613
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,320
Be quick-witted.

614
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,320
Choose one.

615
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,000
Three times a day?

616
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,320
That's it.

617
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:12,040
Or three days a month.

618
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,360
Don't bargain.

619
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:15,560
Well.

620
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,720
You go to Mount Baizhou first.

621
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,440
Then I will take you to the temple.

622
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,000
Okay?

623
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,680
To the Flower Pavilion.

624
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,720
Come back.

625
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,400
Come back.

626
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,000
Do you know where to go?

627
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,640
You are so poor now.

628
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,760
You can only go to the Flower Pavilion.

629
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,120
Come back.

630
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,200
Do you know where to go?

631
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:31,920
This way.

632
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,920
This way.

633
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,760
You are so panic.

634
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:35,920
This way.

635
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,080
You.

636
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,080
Oh, no.

637
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,520
Our good days are over.

638
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,200
I will take over the position of Flower Pavilion again.

639
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:33,480
Yes.

640
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,560
Why is Immortal Lv Luo, the manager of the spirit object,

641
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,120
locked in the Water Moon Mirror?

642
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,240
Master.

643
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,480
Last time, the spirit object was lost.

644
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,000
Immortal Lv Luo was punished to go to the Water Moon Mirror

645
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,560
and reflect on his mistake.

646
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,520
The rules of Flower Pavilion.

647
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,400
Who is locked in the Water Moon Mirror?

648
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,880
There is no sunlight and rain in the Water Moon Mirror.

649
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:00,120
Only the upper immortals of Flower Mood clan who have made mistakes

650
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,120
are allowed to enter the Water Moon Mirror.

651
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,880
They will be killed.

652
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,560
After healing Lv Luo,

653
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:08,400
send her to the Emperor of Flower Forest for three days.

654
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,160
You will be allowed to let Immortal Lv Luo

655
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,640
punish you for copying the rules three times

656
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,040
to punish you.

657
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,880
The Immortal Lv Luo's law

658
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,680
requires a hundred years of spiritual power

659
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,200
to heal Lv Luo.

660
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,920
Remind her

661
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,800
that she doesn't have many chances.

662
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,800
Yes.

663
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,520
What else?

664
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,920
Report to Master.

665
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,600
The Heavenly Maid of the Northern Immortal Realm

666
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,600
has been waiting outside the palace for a long time.

667
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:35,920
I won't see her.

668
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,520
The Heavenly Maid came from far away from the Northern Immortal Realm.

669
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,040
I said I won't see her.

670
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,120
Yes.

671
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,920
How is my health?

672
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,600
Master Jingxiu hasn't come to the Northern Immortal Realm

673
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,920
to perform the magic for a long time.

674
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,800
She has less and less chances to see him.

675
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,640
Will she be surprised when she sees me?

676
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,520
I will pick her up too.

677
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,520
Oh no.

678
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,520
Is the Demon King of the Immortal Realm also here?

679
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,120
I don't want to see him.

680
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,320
I'm annoyed to see him.

681
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,520
Who else can it be?

682
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:17,720
Lord Kunlun.

683
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,920
Master Mei, have you informed Lord Zhong Tian?

684
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,760
Heavenly Maid.

685
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,320
Master Mei is very honored to see you.

686
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,000
It is just that he is in a hurry.

687
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,400
He is currently in seclusion

688
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:38,400
to visit the

689
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,400
I dare not to disturb his mind.

690
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,400
You mean if he sees me,

691
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,400
his mind will be disturbed?

692
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,400
I dare not to look away.

693
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,400
It must be true.

694
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:46,400
Jingxiu.

695
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
Please give this soul-wrapping spell

696
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,400
to Lord Zhong Tian for me.

697
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,400
When he performed the magic in the Northern Immortal Realm,

698
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,400
he carried out a lot of my duties.

699
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,040
This soul-wrapping spell

700
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,040
is my personal gift.

701
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,240
I dare not to take it for myself.

702
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,240
I can personally teach the God of Heaven

703
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,240
to take it.

704
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,240
Fine.

705
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,240
I won't disturb you then.

706
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
I will come to visit you

707
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,240
when the flower is in bloom.

708
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,240
Master Mei.

709
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,240
The new clan of the Jin has arrived.

710
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,240
Let's go.

711
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,240
Let's go.

712
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,240
All the flower stars of the same clan,

713
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,240
the 100th anniversary of the Holy Meeting

714
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,240
and the Flower Trial is coming.

715
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,240
Please go to the Flower Trial.

716
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,240
The God of Heaven has prepared

717
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,240
the flowers of all the clans

718
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,240
to welcome you.

719
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,240
As everyone knows,

720
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,240
the Flower Trial is the holy meeting of our clan.

721
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,080
It is also the opportunity

722
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,080
for the flower clan to cultivate immortals.

723
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,080
During the Flower Trial,

724
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:59,080
you need to

725
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:00,080
offer your own flowers and fruits.

726
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,080
According to the Lord's will,

727
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:04,080
if the flowers bloom,

728
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,080
you can collect the flower's flowers

729
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,080
and keep it for cultivation.

730
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,080
Besides,

731
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,080
the Flower Trial is the holy meeting of our clan.

732
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,080
Please

733
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,080
follow the etiquette of the Flower Trial.

734
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,080
Yes.

735
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,920
Can I really see the God?

736
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,920
Who are you?

737
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,920
How dare you make a fuss in public?

738
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,920
I am Hong Ning.

739
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,920
I am not a fairy.

740
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,920
I am the red tea flower demon.

741
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:32,920
You are the demon.

742
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:33,920
Red tea flower demon.

743
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,920
How dare you?

744
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,920
Where are you from?

745
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,920
Bai Zhou Mountain.

746
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,920
Bai Zhou Mountain.

747
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:39,920
The demon of Bai Zhou Mountain.

748
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,920
Why is he here?

749
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,920
It is the one who opened the flowers.

750
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,760
Why is he still alive?

751
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,760
Immortal Xie,

752
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,760
Magistrate Ju told me

753
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,800
that he was brought to the Heaven

754
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,800
to be punished by the God.

755
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,800
Why is he punished

756
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,800
to come to Heaven?

757
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,800
It seems to be a severe punishment.

758
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,800
No wonder he is so impudent.

759
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,800
Take the Water Moon Mirror.

760
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,800
Magistrate Ju said

761
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,800
he would go to the Palace with the Flower Immortal.

762
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,800
He said that the God told him to do it.

763
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,800
How insolent.

764
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,800
Alright.

765
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,680
Since it is the God's order,

766
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,680
we will follow the rules of the new clan.

767
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,680
Red tea demon.

768
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,680
Yes.

769
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,680
I don't care where you come from.

770
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,680
Since you are in the Flower Palace,

771
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,680
you should know the rules here.

772
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,680
The rules of the Flower Palace are strict.

773
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,680
Don't make any mistakes.

774
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,680
I got it.

775
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,680
Your clothes don't fit the etiquette.

776
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,680
Even if you are punished,

777
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,680
you can't do this.

778
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,680
That's right.

779
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,560
Shaoyao.

780
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,560
You take her to wash her face first.

781
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,560
Then change into clean clothes.

782
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,560
Don't let her make the Flower Palace dirty.

783
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,560
Yes.

784
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,560
It's so beautiful.

785
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,560
You are really a demon.

786
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:09,560
Yes.

787
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,560
Shaoyao, you are so beautiful.

788
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,440
I have lived for so long.

789
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,440
I have never seen a demon in the Heaven.

790
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,440
How dare you not cross the flower line and open the flowers?

791
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,440
Do you think you have any special power?

792
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,440
I can only open flowers.

793
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,440
I don't know any other rules.

794
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,440
Fairy, why are your flowers

795
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,440
and your flowers open together?

796
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,440
This is the Heaven.

797
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,440
The flowers in the lower realm are opened by the flower line.

798
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,440
The Flower Palace is different from the human world.

799
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,440
The seasons and weather here

800
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,440
are affected by the mood of the flower god.

801
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,320
But the long-lasting spring

802
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,320
can also be suddenly autumn and winter.

803
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,320
The gods are really doing things.

804
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,320
But it's strange.

805
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,320
The flowers in the Flower Palace suddenly changed a lot.

806
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,320
It feels like spring is coming.

807
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,320
But the order of the god

808
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,200
is always in order.

809
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,200
Maybe the god is in a good mood today.

810
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,200
The Flower Palace is so beautiful.

811
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,200
I have never seen so many beautiful fairies

812
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,200
and such a tall house.

813
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,200
Keep your voice down.

814
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,200
What is the Heaven?

815
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,200
Of course it's not as good as our fairy.

816
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,200
The Heaven is good.

817
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,200
The Heaven has good friends

818
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
and many delicious things.

819
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,080
You eat too much smoke and smoke.

820
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,080
You can't be a fairy.

821
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,080
There are so many fairies

822
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,080
who come and go every day to get the internal order.

823
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:49,080
I feel worried and afraid.

824
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,080
If all the fairies in Mount Baizhou gather and commit crimes,

825
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:55,080
where did you come from?

826
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,080
I came from Mount Baizhou.

827
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,080
Mount Baizhou is a good place.

828
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:01,080
My friends are all good fairies.

829
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,960
Where does the flower god live?

830
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:07,960
Don't talk about the flower god.

831
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,960
How can he be so easy to see?

832
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,960
He doesn't live with us?

833
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,960
Of course not.

834
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,960
The flower god has his own place.

835
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,960
The flower palaces we just passed by

836
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,960
are all special palaces with high-quality paintings.

837
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:22,960
Sit down.

838
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,960
Those low-class weeds

839
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,960
all live in the White Flower Pavilion.

840
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,960
You have to live there too.

841
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,960
I'm not a weed.

842
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:31,840
I'm not a weed.

843
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,840
Okay, I got it.

844
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,840
Look over there.

845
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,840
Those who have a bag on their clothes

846
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,840
are all high-class fairies.

847
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,840
Don't make any more trouble.

848
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,840
The rules here are very strict.

849
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,840
The god won't show mercy.

850
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,840
If you get caught by him again,

851
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,840
you'll have to take the internal order,

852
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,840
eliminate the fairy,

853
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,840
and throw the flower water into the Pavilion.

854
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,840
Is the flower god like this?

855
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,720
Of course.

856
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,720
Everyone knows about the flower god.

857
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:03,720
I'm also surprised.

858
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:06,720
You didn't care about the flower god's private opening.

859
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,720
You actually survived.

860
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,720
Why does it have to be the flower god?

861
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,720
This is...

862
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,720
This is the rule.

863
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:17,720
But isn't the flower god's decision

864
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,720
up to the flower god?

865
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,720
It's like what people want to do

866
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,720
is also decided by people.

867
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,720
What kind of nonsense is this?

868
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,720
Sister Bai He!

869
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,720
Wait for me here.

870
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,720
I'll go ask about her internal matter.

871
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,720
Be sure to wait for me.

872
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,720
Don't run around.

873
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,720
Excuse me, where is the Pavilion?

874
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,600
Pavilion?

875
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,600
Pavilion?

876
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,600
Pavilion?

877
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,600
Pavilion?

878
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,600
Pavilion?

879
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,600
Pavilion?

880
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:11,600
Pavilion?

881
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,600
Pavilion?

882
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,600
Pavilion?

883
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,600
Pavilion?

884
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,600
Pavilion?

885
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,600
Pavilion?

886
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,600
Pavilion?

887
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,600
Pavilion?

888
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:28,480
Pavilion?

889
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,480
Pavilion?

890
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,480
Why did you climb up there?

891
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,480
It's you.

892
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:56,480
I'm going to the hospital.

893
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,480
I'm going to the hospital.

894
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,480
I'm going to the hospital.

895
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,480
I'm going to the hospital.

896
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,480
I'm going to the hospital.

897
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,480
I'm going to the hospital.

898
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,480
I'm going to the hospital.

899
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,480
I'm going to the hospital.

900
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,480
I'm going to the hospital.

901
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:14,480
I'm going to the hospital.

902
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,480
I'm going to the hospital.

903
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,480
I'm going to the hospital.

904
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,480
I'm going to the hospital.

905
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:22,480
I'm going to the hospital.

906
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:23,480
I'm going to the hospital.

907
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,480
I'm going to the hospital.

908
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,480
I'm going to the hospital.

909
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,480
I'm going to the hospital.

910
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,480
I'm going to the hospital.

911
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:33,480
I'm going to the hospital.

912
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,480
I'm going to the hospital.

913
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,480
I'm going to the hospital.

914
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:39,480

I'm going to the hospital.

920
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,480
I'm going to the hospital.

921
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:53,480
I'm going to the hospital.

922
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:55,480
I'm going to the hospital.

923
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,480
I'm going to the hospital.

924
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,480
I'm going to the hospital.

925
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,480
I'm going to the hospital.

926
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,480

I'm going to the hospital.

931
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,480
I'm going to the hospital.

932
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,480
I'm going to the hospital.

933
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,480
