1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm drunk.

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The beautiful scenery in the painting

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
is the place where we met in the painting.

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The Long Ballad

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Episode 16

6
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Long Ballad

7
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Lord Shen Zun, are you alright?

8
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm fine.

9
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
He still doesn't want to leave.

10
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Lord Shen Zun, do you need me to drive him away?

11
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
No need.

12
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Now he's in the Three Realms, everyone has their own way.

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Lord Shen Zun, aren't you worried?

14
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The Heavenly Soldiers who came today,

15
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
if it wasn't because of the Long Ballad,

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm afraid that he can't escape from a dispute today.

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
He's not the same little demon from back then.

18
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
His power of the Demon King has awakened.

19
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
He doesn't need anyone to protect him anymore.

20
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Without me,

21
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
he might be living better.

22
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You still can't let him go?

23
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
So what if I can't let him go?

24
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,000
From now on, I won't have him anymore.

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I'm sorry.

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm sorry.

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I'm sorry.

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm sorry.

35
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Lord Shen Zun, this place is no longer safe.

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Where are you going?

38
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Bai Yu Mo Kuai has lost his mind to save me.

39
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
From now on,

40
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,200
I'm not trying to drive you away.

41
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,440
I want you to live well

42
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,240
and live well in this world.

43
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,000
I saved you

44
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,920
and never expected you to repay me.

45
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,360
Now everything you've done

46
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,840
is far more than what I've given you.

47
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,120
But I've never felt that way.

48
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:49,440
Lu Jiu,

49
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,360
you've been following me for many lives

50
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,360
and living for me.

51
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,480
What's wrong with living for you?

52
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,200
You never tried to live for yourself.

53
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,240
I've made so many mistakes in my life.

54
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,760
I've been taught for many lives.

55
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,200
That's why I understand this.

56
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,680
I'll find a way to live for myself.

57
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,600
But before that,

58
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,320
I won't leave you.

59
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,600
You must remember what you said.

60
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,280
Find a way to live for yourself.

61
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,440
I'll find a way to live for myself.

62
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,000
Your Majesty

63
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,920
Greetings, Master Kunlun.

64
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,280
Where is Her Highness?

65
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,200
Her Highness went to the Evangelical stage.

66
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,040
She just left.

67
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,080
I'm going to tell you that she's coming.

68
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,000
No need.

69
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,880
I'm here to see my father,

70
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,760
all of you may leave.

71
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,040
Yes.

72
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,800
Old man.

73
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,400
Wake up.

74
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,640
My brother was so angry that

75
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,280
he drove her out of the world.

76
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,080
How do you feel

77
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,800
now that youó

78
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,440
Forget it.

79
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,280
Don't make such a fuss about it.

80
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,800
We were about to evict還有

81
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,800
and overhteat you up so hard.

82
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,000
Fight for it.

83
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,680
Let me explain eventually.

84
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,960
His Majesty wants me to evict husband with my brother

85
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,720
Bon yellow.

86
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,720
I thought this could make our family harmonious.

87
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,720
But who knew it would become like this?

88
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,720
After Jingxiu died,

89
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,720
Mother wanted me to inherit the throne of Heaven and Earth.

90
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,720
I actually knew

91
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:07,720
that at this time, I should stand up

92
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,720
and do my duty as a subject.

93
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,720
But I really can't get past this.

94
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
You said

95
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
that only Jingxiu could

96
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
inherit the throne of Heaven and Earth.

97
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,720
Only those who can inherit the throne of Heaven and Earth

98
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,720
have the right to inherit the throne of the Emperor.

99
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,720
I can't go to the Emperor's palace

100
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:34,720
and take the throne.

101
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
I can't go to the Emperor's palace

102
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,720
and take the throne.

103
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,720
I can't take what belongs to Jingxiu.

104
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
I can't just

105
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,720
inherit the throne of the Emperor.

106
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,720
By the way,

107
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,720
who gave birth to Jingxiu?

108
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,720
The daughter of Jingxiu

109
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,720
must be a beautiful and beautiful woman.

110
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
Otherwise, why would Jingxiu face the world like this?

111
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,720
If she had a little crooked eyes,

112
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,720
Mother might not be so angry.

113
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
Father,

114
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,720
give me some more time.

115
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,720
Let my Heavenly Emperor's heart shine.

116
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,720
So maybe I can

117
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,720
be like my brother

118
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,720
and become your most important son.

119
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:54,720
I'm leaving.

120
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,720
I've been busy with things these days.

121
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,720
Mother has to work hard and be lonely to help her.

122
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
You should have some time

123
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
to wake up.

124
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Don't be too sleepy.

125
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,720
Miss, look.

126
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
The rouge in our house is very famous.

127
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,720
Miss, which one do you like?

128
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
Look.

129
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
Which one do you like?

130
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,720
If you don't like it,

131
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,720
I'll buy all of them.

132
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
This one.

133
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:25,720
She's in the middle of the pond.

134
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,720
There's a big one.

135
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
All kinds of patterns are beautiful.

136
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,720
I like it.

137
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:29,720
I like it.

138
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,720
There's a big one.

139
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,720
All kinds of patterns are beautiful.

140
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,720
I like it.

141
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,720
I like it.

142
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,720
The flowers in the sky

143
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,720
bloom for her.

144
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Flowers in the book are like the old days.

145
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Her skirt is also a piece of art.

146
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:04,720
She's as beautiful as a horse in the middle of the road.

147
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,720
If I want to spend the rest of my life with her,

148
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,720
I'll have to part with her.

149
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:17,720
Time and place are always the same.

150
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,720
She's in the middle of the mountain.

151
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,720
I've never forgotten her.

152
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,720
The flowers are still in full bloom.

153
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,720
I'm looking at the old man's feet.

154
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,720
I miss him.

155
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,720
I'm eating a delicious food.

156
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,720
The old days are long.

157
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
It's better to be like this.

158
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,720
The four seasons are too long.

159
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,720
There's still a long way to go.

160
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,720
Master.

161
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,720
I've been looking for you for a long time.

162
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,720
Are you okay?

163
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,720
This girl.

164
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
I don't know you at all.

165
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
Don't do it.

166
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
You don't remember me?

167
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,720
It's because you're hurt, right?

168
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,720
I heard from the police that you were kicked out of the sacred valley.

169
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,720
Are you okay?

170
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,720
I don't understand what you're talking about.

171
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,720
It doesn't matter if you don't understand.

172
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,720
You just have to know that I won't hurt you.

173
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,720
Let me see where else you're hurt.

174
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
Nonsense.

175
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,720
Master.

176
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,720
I've been looking for you for a thousand years.

177
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,720
I know I've done a lot of things that I'm sorry about you.

178
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
Let you be hurt.

179
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,720
But I can explain.

180
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,720
This girl.

181
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,720
I don't know who you hurt.

182
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,720
But if she sees you holding other men's hands on the street.

183
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,720
I'm sure she won't be happy.

184
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
No one else has ever.

185
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,720
If there's nothing else, I'll go first.

186
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,720
I just left for a while.

187
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,720
You're here to bother Master again.

188
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
He said he didn't want to see you.

189
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
Master.

190
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,720
Master.

191
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
Master.

192
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,720
Why are you lying to me?

193
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
Are you still mad at me?

194
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,720
If you want to get rid of the hatred, you can kill me.

195
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,720
You're so sure I want to kill you.

196
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,720
I'll accept whatever you do.

197
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,720
I'm afraid.

198
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,720
It's scarier than death.

199
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,720
If you're afraid, just go.

200
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
I won't go.

201
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
You killed my father.

202
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,720
I've returned the sacred bone for you.

203
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
I just don't want to see you again.

204
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,720
There's nothing to say.

205
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
You know my power is low.

206
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,720
If he wants to kill me,

207
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,720
I don't know how he was hurt by me.

208
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,720
How did I get so much power to hurt him?

209
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,720
But I remember it clearly.

210
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,720
He said he put the sacred bone on you.

211
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,720
He admitted that you're not his child.

212
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,720
He's not my son.

213
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,720
If he's not a star,

214
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,720
he would have been thrown into the Qilin Cave and drowned.

215
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,720
He's not my child.

216
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,720
He's not my child.

217
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,720
He's not my child.

218
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,720
Why didn't you say it then?

219
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
Why did you want me to kill you?

220
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,720
Why did you say those cruel words?

221
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,720
Because I don't want your Hua Zhao Gong to die with me.

222
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,720
I want to protect you.

223
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,720
I owe you for what happened today.

224
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,720
You killed him to protect me.

225
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,720
You'd rather I kill you

226
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,720
than tell me the truth.

227
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,720
You did it to protect me.

228
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,720
What about Sui Xian Xian?

229
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,720
What did you do to explain it?

230
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
Was it to protect me?

231
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
Sui Xian Xian.

232
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
In this world,

233
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:53,720
you're not able to get close to me.

234
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,720
No.

235
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,720
I shouldn't believe it.

236
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,720
I thought I couldn't let go of hatred.

237
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,720
But when I found you,

238
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,720
I realized that

239
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,720
I never thought of hatred

240
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,720
when I found you.

241
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,720
But you'd rather bear Sui Xian Xian

242
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:34,720
than admit your love for me.

243
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,720
So many people died because of you.

244
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,720
Their love is unbearable to me.

245
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,720
But when I found out about Lu Jiu,

246
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,720
I realized

247
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,720
that I was the one to blame.

248
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,720
You trusted me and loved me.

249
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,720
But I was lying to you.

250
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,720
I was afraid that you'd feel that

251
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,720
my love for you was not pure.

252
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:04,720
I...

253
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,720
I was afraid that I wouldn't see you

254
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,720
again when I heard your words.

255
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
So,

256
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,720
this is the reason why you were in pain all the time?

257
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,720
Yes.

258
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,720
Pain.

259
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,720
I was in pain when I thought of you.

260
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
Who am I?

261
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,720
Lord Zhong Tian,

262
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,720
Lord Shen,

263
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,720
and Lord Shen Zun.

264
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,720
When I was about to go down the street,

265
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,720
my mother told me

266
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
that I was the one who loved you.

267
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:27,720
I was afraid that you'd feel that

268
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,720
I was the one who loved you.

269
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:33,720
But I was afraid that

270
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:35,720
you'd feel that

271
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,720
my mother told me

272
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,720
that I was not her biological son.

273
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,720
No matter who you are,

274
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,720
you are my Jinxiu.

275
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,720
I was thinking that

276
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
after I went down the street,

277
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,720
I'd find a place I like.

278
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,720
I'd live a life I like.

279
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
Then I'd die there quietly.

280
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,720
The immortal life is long.

281
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,720
I've been in the Heaven Realm for thousands of years.

282
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,720
Now I think about it,

283
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,720
it's not as good as a short experience.

284
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,720
It's even more profound.

285
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,720
I'm like

286
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
a stone that doesn't break.

287
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,720
It's there.

288
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,720
People come and go

289
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,720
and shout to a stone,

290
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,720
Lord Shen Zun.

291
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,720
But only I know

292
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,720
that the inner part of this stone

293
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,720
is broken.

294
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,720
Now I think

295
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,720
maybe everything has a reason.

296
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,720
Maybe

297
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,720
I shouldn't be there.

298
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,720
Maybe

299
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
you're waiting for me.

300
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,720
When you killed me,

301
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,720
I wanted to push you into the Qi Lin Cave.

302
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,720
So,

303
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,720
you want me to go to the Qi Lin Cave?

304
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
I'll go with you.

305
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
There are mountains and lakes.

306
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,720
I'll be with you.

307
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,720
It's been so long.

308
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,720
Why hasn't His Majesty responded?

309
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,720
Mother, don't worry too much.

310
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,720
Father will be safe.

311
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
Your Majesty.

312
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
Father.

313
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
Father.

314
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,720
Father.

315
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,720
Father.

316
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,720
Father.

317
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,720
Father.

318
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,720
Come.

319
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,720
Hurry.

320
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,720
Hurry.

321
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
Tell the three realms that His Majesty is awake.

322
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,720
Yes.

323
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,720
Your Majesty.

324
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
What's that?

325
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
It's you.

326
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,720
Why are you filming me?

327
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,720
You're a little fox.

328
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
Why aren't you a good tiger?

329
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,720
There are monsters everywhere.

330
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,720
You're walking on the road with a big beast.

331
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,720
Aren't you afraid of being caught?

332
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,720
They can't beat me.

333
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,720
Aren't you a monster too?

334
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,720
Why are you here?

335
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,720
You think I want to?

336
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,720
I'm taking them to escape.

337
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,720
I'm helping you.

338
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:34,720
You don't know how to be a good tiger, do you?

339
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,720
Escape?

340
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,720
Where are you going?

341
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,720
Mount Baizhou.

342
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,720
The monsters who are nowhere to be found now go to Mount Baizhou.

343
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,720
Stop.

344
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
Where are you going?

345
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:47,720
No.

346
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,720
The day is coming.

347
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:49,720
They must have felt our demon aura.

348
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
It's like a dog's nose.

349
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,720
Go.

350
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,720
Hurry.

351
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,720
What are you doing?

352
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,720
I'm here.

353
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
I'm here.

354
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,720
General Man Wu.

355
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,720
Where are you going?

356
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,720
Aren't you going to see His Majesty?

357
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,720
As a divine power,

358
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,720
I've seen countless demons being put into the Qilin Cave.

359
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,720
I've never thought that this might be related to my background.

360
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,720
I feel sorry for those demons who were put into the Qilin Cave.

361
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,720
They were caught by the heavens and were in great pain.

362
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,720
Only the most evil demon will be put in here.

363
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,720
Since the Heavenly Emperor wants to lock me in the Qilin Cave,

364
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,720
my background might be related to the demons.

365
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,720
I think this is a good idea.

366
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,720
At least you're like me.

367
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,720
No one will say anything about the demons being different.

368
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,720
You're quite thoughtful.

369
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,720
I've always been thoughtful.

370
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,720
The sky is in danger.

371
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,720
I might not be able to go back.

372
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,720
I'm going to the cave.

373
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,720
Since I'm here,

374
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,720
I don't want to go back alive.

375
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:30,720
Let's go.

376
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
This is...

377
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,720
the smell of the Demon King.

378
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,720
The smell of the Demon King.

379
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,720
Who are you?

380
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:46,740
I'm the

381
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:53,720
It's you.

382
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,720
My master is the head of the demons.

383
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
He's the Demon King.

384
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,720
Your master is the Demon King?

385
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,720
My master is the head of all demons.

386
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,720
I've been waiting for my master for a long time.

387
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,720
A long time.

388
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:26,720
I almost forgot it.

389
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
You

390
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,720
were saved by his bones.

391
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,720
You're my master.

392
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,720
I've been waiting for you.

393
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,720
I've been waiting for you.

394
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,720
Master,

395
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,720
all your desires

396
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,720
are in this dream now.

397
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,720
You have to think about everything.

398
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,720
You will remember everything.

399
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
I know

400
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:35,720
You will remember everything.

401
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:35,720
You mean you not only punished Jinxiu,

402
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:41,720
but also gave the seal to Kunlun without permission?

403
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,720
Jinxiu has the evil spirit of Heaven.

404
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,720
It's unforgivable to assassinate the Heavenly Emperor.

405
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,720
I just did what I should do.

406
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:52,720
How dare you!

407
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,720
Father, the situation was urgent.

408
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,720
If I don't worship the Heaven, I'm afraid there will be a big disaster.

409
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,720
I had no choice but to do it.

410
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,720
Your Majesty, Jinxiu knew that the evil spirit of Heaven is the evil spirit of Heaven.

411
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,720
He even took her to Heaven.

412
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,720
He even allowed her to approach you step by step and hurt you.

413
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,720
He deceived you and defied the Heaven's law.

414
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,720
He even made you suffer a lot.

415
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:22,720
He deceived you and defied the Heaven's law.

416
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,720
Are you still going to protect him?

417
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,720
Are you still going to protect the evil spirit of Heaven?

418
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,720
What is the evil spirit of Heaven?

419
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,720
It's exactly the evil spirit of Heaven that hurt you.

420
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:39,720
How much more do you want to disobey him?

421
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:42,720
So what?

422
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,720
No matter how many evil spirits of Heaven, they are not important.

423
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,720
I only want Jinxiu.

424
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:54,720
Father, I've already become a mortal in the mortal world.

425
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,720
Just let her go and let her live as a mortal.

426
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,720
You ignorant child.

427
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:08,720
You are a woman. What do you know?

428
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,720
I'm afraid that you will be disappointed.

429
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:24,340
Jinxiu has lost her

430
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:26,720
I'm afraid that no one can inherit your position in Heaven and Earth.

431
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,720
Even if it's a corpse,

432
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:35,720
I want to find her back.

433
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,720
I don't care if she is a human or a immortal.

434
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:48,720
The evil spirits in the world can all die.

435
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,720
Only Jinxiu can complete it.

436
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:57,720
I worked hard on this chess board for more than ten thousand years.

437
00:31:57,720 --> 00:32:00,720
But you

438
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:05,720
For your own desire,

439
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:11,720
you cut the sword and broke my chess board.

440
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,720
Father, I don't understand.

441
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,720
You don't understand.

442
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,720
Who can understand?

443
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,720
Pass the order.

444
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,720
Yes.

445
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:42,720
Even if you cut the three realms,

446
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,720
you have to find Jinxiu.

447
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,720
Yes.

448
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,720
I'm sorry.

449
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,720
I'm sorry.

450
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,720
This is the dream in the eyes that Qingshe said.

451
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,720
Did you hear anything before you came here?

452
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,720
I heard a woman calling your name.

453
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,720
This brother, is this Mount Baizhou?

454
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,720
He can't see us.

455
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,720
What are you torturing?

456
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,720
The dream in the eyes.

457
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
So that's what it means.

458
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,720
The immortal said that he liked red tea flowers the most.

459
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,720
If I let them all bloom,

460
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,720
he must be very happy.

461
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,720
Now the fairy demons are all like this.

462
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,720
It's almost a fight.

463
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,720
You still have the heart to talk to the immortal about love.

464
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:14,720
What nonsense are you talking about?

465
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:17,720
Don't ruin my image in the immortal's heart.

466
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:20,720
I say, let's fight the black snake in the sky.

467
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:22,720
There's nothing to do.

468
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:24,720
Get out of here. He's coming.

469
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,720
Little demon, what are you looking for me for?

470
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:30,720
Did you get into trouble again?

471
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,720
Fairy, look.

472
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:43,720
It's pretty good.

473
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:47,720
So this heart fairy is His Majesty's sister.

474
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,720
But why haven't I heard my father mention her?

475
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:55,720
When I was in the garden, I heard His Majesty mention her.

476
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:56,720
He said that ten thousand years ago,

477
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:59,720
the garden was once the residence of an immortal.

478
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:03,720
But no one remembered her name.

479
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:07,720
Maybe, she is my mother.

480
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,720
I don't know.

481
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,720
She is my mother.

482
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,720
You didn't even see a shadow. What's the rush?

483
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,720
What's going on?

484
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,720
I've been sick all day and night.

485
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,720
Could something have happened?

486
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:32,720
It shouldn't.

487
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
Come, come, come. Lie down.

488
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,720
It hurts so much.

489
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:39,720
I can't walk anymore.

490
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:43,720
Little demon, what's wrong with you?

491
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,720
I swear that I've been thinking too much.

492
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,720
I've been thinking about you.

493
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,720
Fairy, where are you going?

494
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,720
Don't play such a boring game anymore.

495
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,720
I won't come see you again.

496
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,720
Why?

497
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,720
I'm a diviner and you're a demon.

498
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,720
We're both against the heavenly law.

499
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:13,720
So what?

500
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,720
The heavenly law can't make our child have no father.

501
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:23,720
Isn't the heavenly law you're talking about your own?

502
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,720
How is that possible?

503
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,720
Everything is possible.

504
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:34,720
You don't have to worry so much.

505
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,720
Do you know what's most important now?

506
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,720
What?

507
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,720
Name our child.

508
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,720
Have you thought about it?

509
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,720
You've thought about it?

510
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,720
Of course. I've thought about it a long time ago.

511
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,720
After our child grows up,

512
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
he will be like me.

513
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,720
He will be the king of the world.

514
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:04,720
So I plan to name him...

515
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,720
Tianba.

516
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,720
Is there anything else?

517
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,720
Don't you like it?

518
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,720
I thought of something else.

519
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,720
Come.

520
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,720
King of Heaven.

521
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,720
I just hope that the peace can last forever.

522
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,720
Jinxiu of the mountains and rivers.

523
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,720
Why don't you call him Jinxiu?

524
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,720
Jinxiu?

525
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:46,720
Jinxiu.

526
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,720
Jinxiu is good.

527
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,720
Then you can call him Jinxiu.

528
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,720
You can call him Jinxiu.

529
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,720
From now on, you can call him Jinxiu.

530
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,720
Be gentle.

531
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:09,720
Jinxiu.

532
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,720
Jinxiu.

533
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,720
Jinxiu.

534
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,720
It's just a small wound.

535
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:57,720
Cixin.

536
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:11,720
I know you won't let us go.

537
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,720
I really hope you can keep this child.

538
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,720
As long as you let him live, we will die together.

539
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,720
Cixin, as a judge,

540
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,720
you are so stubborn.

541
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,720
Cixin, I don't want you to die.

542
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:32,720
I want you to live well with Jinxiu.

543
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:45,720
If you die, how can I live alone?

544
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,720
Jinxiu.

545
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,720
Jinxiu.

546
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,720
Master.

547
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,720
You are the monster king.

548
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,720
Cheng Tianxiao, you are so funny.

549
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:33,720
Even if you kill me, you can't kill the monsters in the world.

550
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,720
As long as someone remembers, the monster king will exist.

551
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,720
As long as the monster king exists,

552
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,720
the demon world will never surrender to your immortal realm.

553
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:45,720
Sooner or later, a new monster king will appear.

554
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,720
I will kill you.

555
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,720
Husband.

556
