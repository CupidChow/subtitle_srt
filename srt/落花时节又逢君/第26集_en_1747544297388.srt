1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I will never forget your kindness

2
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and your kindness

3
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I will never forget your kindness

4
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and your kindness

5
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and your kindness

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and your kindness

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
and your kindness

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
and your kindness

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
and your kindness

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
and your kindness

11
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
and your kindness

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
and your kindness

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
and your kindness

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
and your kindness

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
and your kindness

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
and your kindness

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
and your kindness

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
and your kindness

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
and your kindness

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
and your kindness

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
and your kindness

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
and your kindness

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
and your kindness

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
and your kindness

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
and your kindness

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and your kindness

27
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
and your kindness

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
and your kindness

29
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You have thought about it

30
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
You want to marry me

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Marry you?

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Why should I marry you?

33
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Why did you say that just now?

34
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
That's because you said that

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
the Heavenly Maid is not good at magic

36
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I said that to support the Heavenly Maid

37
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Otherwise, why do you think I want to spend this money?

38
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
What?

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I will not let you go

40
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
with your words

41
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You are a demon

42
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Listen to me

43
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Even if you get my man

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
you can't get my heart

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
My heart is the Heavenly Maid

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I warn you

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What's the use of the father's clothes?

48
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I will not spend the money if I steal it

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
There is really someone like you in this world

50
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You are so self-righteous

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Really?

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I am not going to kill you for her

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I don't even want to say a word

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Help me

55
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Help me

56
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Heavenly Maid

57
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Your Highness

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Your Highness

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Wake up

60
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Your Highness

61
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Your Highness

62
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
The Heavenly Maid is really good

63
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Who are you?

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You are the one you can't offend

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You are right

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Don't bother me

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
If you don't kill her today, no one will live

68
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Actually

69
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
You two don't have to fight for me

70
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
You don't have a chance

71
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
My heart is her

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I can see

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Kneel down

74
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Be my teacher

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I am leaving

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Heavenly Maid

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Be my teacher

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Recently, the Demon Envoy Wu Zhang came out

79
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I think you might be interested

80
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If you think you are feeling better

81
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Why don't we go to the street and have a walk

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
This dish

83
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
How is it?

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's quite special

85
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Who made it?

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You know it well

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
General often makes soup for others

88
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
If you say often

89
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You don't have to make it so special

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I didn't find you in the house

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I know you are here

92
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I know you are here

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
You made a big noise yesterday

94
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Brother

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I came back safely

96
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Thanks to my teacher

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I saved you

98
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I heard that

99
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You killed the demon

100
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
It's rare

101
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Then I will introduce you

102
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
This is my brother

103
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Jingxiu

104
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
This is my sister-in-law

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Mu Xin

106
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
This is my teacher

107
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Your Highness

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Lu Niang

109
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Mu Xin

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Hello

111
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I have heard about you

112
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Today

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You are different

114
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
That's right

115
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This is the one I yearn for

116
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Your Highness

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:44,980
The feed is

118
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,000
There are many things that I need to learn from the Heavenly Maid.

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
After hearing that you've been hunting for a thousand years, I also want to come and meet you.

120
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,200
You're still injured. Let's do it next time.

121
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,000
Oh, right!

122
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,800
Master, aren't you going to teach me magic and the methods of the demon in the stone wall?

123
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,800
You better teach me quickly. Or else, if I meet a demon like that again,

124
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,200
I won't be able to protect myself.

125
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,000
I really don't know what else you can do. Come with me.

126
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
We're leaving first.

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:26,000
General, do you know that lady?

128
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I don't. I just like that lady.

129
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Kunlun was attacked last night?

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yes. The demon.

131
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What's strange is that the demon was hiding in Shangchun House.

132
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He suddenly called for the merchant.

133
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I don't know how Kunlun found him.

134
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I don't know.

135
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Go up to the street and take a look.

136
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Master, have some tea.

137
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The reason why the two Star of Heaven and Earth are crossing the border in Wu Zhang State

138
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
is because Wu Zhang State is about to face an unprecedented disaster.

139
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Whoever can solve this matter will be the first to light up the Star of Heaven and Earth.

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
May I ask what the Queen of God is trying to solve?

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Heaven's plans cannot be leaked.

142
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I also don't know the details.

143
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
When you get there, you must be careful.

144
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
I hope that Kunlun will be able to solve this matter before Jinxiu.

145
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Yes.

146
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Come, Master. Have some tea.

147
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Master, why are you staring at the meat shop owner?

148
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
If you want to eat meat, I'll take you to the market.

149
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Look at the meat shop owner. What's strange?

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Master, it turns out that you like this.

151
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I... I... I can do it too.

152
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Be serious.

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Look at his familiar face.

154
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
He's so handsome.

155
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,620
Isn't this how the kill pigs are all

156
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,000
fighting?

157
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Really?

158
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
What else?

159
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I've checked.

160
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
There's only one well here.

161
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Drinking water can cure diseases.

162
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Guess who has the closest well?

163
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't know.

164
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I've checked.

165
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
There's only one well here.

166
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
I've checked.

167
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Guess who has the closest well?

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The meat shop owner?

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Smart. You're right.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I've checked.

171
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
There's a strange smell in this well.

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
It must be the meat shop owner who lost his magic.

173
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Master, you're thinking too much.

174
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Kunlun, you must listen to me.

175
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Wu Zhangguo will face an unprecedented disaster.

176
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
You must grow up soon.

177
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Master, are you too nervous?

178
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
As the son of the Prime Minister,

179
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
you must learn to care about the people.

180
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Don't slack off.

181
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
No, Master.

182
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
I don't understand.

183
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What does the disaster have to do with the meat shop owner?

184
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
You don't understand.

185
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
This monster is playing a big game.

186
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
The meat shop owner cares about the people's food and clothing.

187
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
If they keep doing this, the people in the capital will be in trouble.

188
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
If they get sick,

189
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
they will cause a big mess and the capital will be in chaos.

190
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Wu Zhangguo will be in chaos.

191
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
When the time comes, all the armies will use their own weapons to attack the enemy.

192
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
They will fight for the king.

193
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
Master, Wu Zhangguo is in trouble.

194
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Kunlun.

195
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Master.

196
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
You finally open the door.

197
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Yes, Master.

198
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Shang Chunlong.

199
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Why did you check?

200
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
The son of the Prime Minister is here to attend the meeting.

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
He needs to check for now.

202
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Come.

203
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,000
What do you like?

204
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Check it out.

205
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
What do you like?

206
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I will buy it for you.

207
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I don't like it.

208
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
If you don't like it, I will buy it for you.

209
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Since I am your master,

210
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
you have to listen to me for the past few decades.

211
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
I ask you to care about your heart.

212
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
And follow your heart.

213
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Look.

214
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Which one do you want?

215
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
If you don't want, I will buy them all.

216
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
This one.

217
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I said I don't like it.

218
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Why are you still angry?

219
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
If you don't like these, what do you like?

220
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Just say it.

221
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
You are really a man of your word.

222
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
You can have whatever you want.

223
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
I am different from you.

224
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I ask you a question.

225
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Should you follow your heart?

226
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Or you just go and practice to be a fairy?

227
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
I never wanted to be a fairy.

228
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
But I think even a mortal

229
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
can't follow his heart.

230
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
So Cheng Zhong is the same as outside the city.

231
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
You will choose Cheng Zhong.

232
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,000
In the balance of interests,

233
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
you can always make a choice.

234
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Where did you get this idea?

235
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,000
It's just a thing.

236
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Why do you involve so much in it?

237
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
If you exchange the lives of the people

238
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
with the lives of the whole world,

239
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
what will you choose?

240
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,000
What's wrong?

241
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
It's nothing.

242
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,620
The

243
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Here you are.

244
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The internal belt of the thousand-year snake demon.

245
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You were hurt because you helped me collect the internal belt.

246
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
A little injury.

247
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Congratulations.

248
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
You got what you wanted.

249
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
It's just a thing.

250
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Although you are closer to our goal,

251
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
you are not good at life and death.

252
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
I'm afraid you...

253
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I broke my body and lost my blood.

254
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I can't maintain this body by collecting the internal belt.

255
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I don't have a chance to turn back in the next life.

256
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
I will trust you more.

257
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I know.

258
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
You broke your habit.

259
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
But the blood is deep.

260
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I won't forget this blood.

261
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,000
The whole heart is soft.

262
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
It hurts.

263
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Dad, mom.

264
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Dad, mom.

265
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Queen.

266
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,000
Only hatred.

267
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
She is my double-brother.

268
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
She is my best friend.

269
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I will be clear with her.

270
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Hongning, remember.

271
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I will always stand on your side.

272
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I just blame myself for not being strong enough

273
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
to let you suffer.

274
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I am wronged.

275
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I will pay for the people who hurt me.

276
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Including Yao Tian.

277
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Including Yao Tian.

278
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,000
But you helped me to be reborn.

279
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,000
And you collected the internal belt for me.

280
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Thank you, Xiaobai.

281
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'm sorry.

282
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
For your sake, I'm willing to do anything.

283
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
Stay in Wu Zhang Country.

284
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Be careful.

285
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'm afraid that he has collusion with Jingxiu.

286
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You can't resist it.

287
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Don't worry.

288
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I will be careful.

289
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm leaving.

290
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Jingxiu, I told you.

291
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I will find you.

292
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
And kill you.

293
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
Moxie is so angry.

294
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I'd better not go to her now.

295
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
What?

296
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
What's wrong?

297
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
You are here just in time.

298
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
For Miss Moxie.

299
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What do you mean?

300
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
You think I'm not a man of my word?

301
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
You help me to give Moxie.

302
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
You are here.

303
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Shut up.

304
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
You are here.

305
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
You are so handsome.

306
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
You are so handsome.

307
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Miss Moxie.

308
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
Miss Moxie.

309
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Why are you here?

310
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Why can't I be here?

311
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
You are waiting for someone else?

312
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
My brother gave you this.

313
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Why didn't he send it himself?

314
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I don't know.

315
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm innocent.

316
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
But I want to say something to you.

317
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Iron tree is rare.

318
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You don't know how to open it.

319
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
You should cherish it.

320
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I know.

321
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
This is the room I prepared for you.

322
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,000
I didn't expect I could use it today.

323
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Before?

324
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
To be honest,

325
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
I've always admired you.

326
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Since when?

327
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Since childhood.

328
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I've been your fan.

329
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Since childhood,

330
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,000
I've dreamed of you for the first time.

331
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
How many times have I told you?

332
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
I'm not a goddess.

333
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Don't call me that.

334
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Okay.

335
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
I won't.

336
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I'll call you master.

337
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Take it away.

338
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Take it away.

339
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Yes.

340
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
I agree.

341
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
It's natural for a goddess to worship herself.

342
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'm sorry.

343
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,000
I won't say that again.

344
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm going to rest.

345
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
You can go now.

346
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Yes.

347
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Wait.

348
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
What is Jinxiu doing recently?

349
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Learn from him.

350
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
What else can he do?

351
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
He's just practicing.

352
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Just do as he says.

353
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Yes.

354
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Go.

355
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm going?

356
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
I'm really going.

357
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Get lost.

358
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Isn't my brother still in the room?

359
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I must be blind.

360
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Everyone looks like a goddess.

361
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm going.

362
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Greetings, Your Grace.

363
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,000
You finally showed up after all these years.

364
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Where have you been?

365
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Your Grace,

366
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm a woman of the lower realm.

367
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I was born evil.

368
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
I just recovered not long ago.

369
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm at Kunlun Mansion now.

370
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Good.

371
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
You must do your best to help Kunlun Army.

372
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:50,000
You must lead the army to light up the world.

373
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Don't worry, Your Grace.

374
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'll do my best.

375
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Do you have news about Jinxiu?

376
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Master Jinxiu is Kunlun Army's cousin.

377
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
He's the general of Wuzhang State.

378
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I've checked him.

379
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
He's been hunting demons and killing them.

380
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
He's been making people sad.

381
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
He's really a little better than Kunlun Army.

382
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
But please rest assured, Your Grace.

383
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
I'll be careful to guide him.

384
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'll make Kunlun Army a great success.

385
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
I'll light up the world in advance.

386
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Tian Hu has been looking for you all these years.

387
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
You have to be careful.

388
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
Thank you for your reminder, Your Grace.

389
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
What are you doing in there every day?

390
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Why are you holding your face?

391
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You...

392
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
You...

393
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,000
You...

394
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Are you all right?

395
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
I didn't mean to do that.

396
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Are you all right?

397
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Thank you.

398
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Brother.

399
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I didn't mean to do that.

400
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Look.

401
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
The embroidery is so beautiful.

402
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I think so, too.

403
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
But don't you think it's missing something?

404
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
If we embroider some beads, it'll shine more.

405
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Let's find some materials later.

406
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Let him do it.

407
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Master asked me to observe Jinxiu.

408
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Is it because I'm observing Jinxiu and Miss Mu Xian's fight?

409
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
What does it mean?

410
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Kunlun.

411
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Kunlun.

412
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You have a good taste.

413
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
How about this one?

414
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
It's beautiful.

415
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Kunlun.

416
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
How about this one?

417
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,000
It's very beautiful.

418
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
It's beautiful.

419
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Master's arrangement

420
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
is not of another business.

421
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Kunlun is also very beautiful.

422
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
Does Master want to fight with me?

423
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
He has a famous book.

424
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
So he uses Miss Mu Xian and Jinxiu to fight.

425
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:32,000
It's not right.

426
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
My brother is so bad.

427
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
He's like that with Miss Mu Xian.

428
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
It's because of my master and me.

429
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I want to fight with him.

430
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,000
No.

431
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
I can't sit and wait.

432
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,000
I have to find a chance

433
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
to get them together and fight.

434
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Otherwise, it will affect my master and me.

435
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Kunlun.

436
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Kunlun.

437
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
Look.

438
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,000
It's beautiful.

439
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
It's beautiful.

440
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Look at this dress.

441
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
It's suitable for Lu Yao and you.

442
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,000
I think

443
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
Kunlun and I are getting married.

444
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
I have prepared a lot.

445
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Yes.

446
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
This is it.

447
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,000
If you like it,

448
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,000
I'll send someone to send it to Lu Yao.

449
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Yes.

450
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
Madam.

451
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Do you have a dress for Miss Mu Xian and Jinxiu?

452
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Of course.

453
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
We are not as vulgar as you men.

454
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
This is for Jinxiu and Miss Mu Xian.

455
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Bring it up.

456
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Let me see.

457
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,000
What do you think?

458
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Good.

459
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,000
Good.

460
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Take it down.

461
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
Take it down.

462
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
Master.

463
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
I'll send it to you later.

464
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
When you send it to Jinxiu,

465
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
you must tell her

466
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
that Miss Mu Xian prepared this for her.

467
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
When you send it to Miss Mu Xian,

468
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
you must tell her

469
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
that Jinxiu prepared this for you.

470
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Okay?

471
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Yes.

472
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Remember.

473
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
You are so sweet.

474
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,000
Yes.

475
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Madam.

476
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
I'll go now.

477
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
I crushed the body.

478
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It became a body.

479
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
It's still a piece of heart.

480
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,000
I know that

481
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
Wu Gen Fu Ping's body

482
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
will be destroyed

483
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
at any time.

484
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Before the daybreak,

485
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
I can't stand

486
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
what I should do and what I should take.

487
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,000
General.

488
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Miss Mu Xian.

489
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Why didn't you

490
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
send the sword yourself?

491
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I thought

492
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
you didn't want to see me.

493
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Aren't you still

494
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
trying to show up in front of me?

495
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
You thought I would say

496
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
that I won't bother you.

497
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,000
I didn't mean it.

498
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,000
You once asked me

499
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
whether it's right to follow your heart

500
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
in life.

501
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I answered

502
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
that in life,

503
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
there are times

504
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
when you can't follow your heart.

505
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
I just want to tell you

506
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
that at this moment,

507
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,000
at this moment,

508
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
I have never changed

509
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
my mind to follow you.

510
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
You have true feelings.

511
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
You also have a lot of money.

512
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
I'm not going to let you

513
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
get away with this.

514
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
I have a fake love story.

515
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
What kind of story is it?

516
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
I have already

517
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,000
told you

518
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
whether you believe it or not.

519
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I believe it.

520
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Then what kind of story

521
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
do you have

522
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
about me?

523
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,000
Thank you for the sword, General Mu Xian.

524
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
You haven't answered me yet.

525
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
Tan Chen is still in the east.

526
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Are you afraid?

527
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
I'm afraid.

528
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
General, don't be so anxious to answer me.

529
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
I will give you time

530
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
to think it through.

531
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Miss Mu Xian asked you to travel the city tonight.

532
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
This is what Miss Mu Xian

533
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
specially prepared for you.

534
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
Did she ask you to give it to me?

535
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Yes.

536
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Has she finally been moved by me?

537
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
General asked you to travel the city tonight.

538
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
This is what General specially prepared for you.

539
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
What is he doing?

540
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,000
General Mu Xian,

541
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,000
you must tell me

542
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
such a strange story.

543
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,000
Is this true?

544
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yes, this is true.

545
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I've already top this up with words.

546
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,000
Why are you telling-

547
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Wei Fei,

548
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
rest yourself for the moment!

549
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
What are you doing?

550
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Let go of me!

551
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
environmentally friendly?

552
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,200
You look good in everything.

553
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,000
So you are the same as all men.

554
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,240
You only look at the skin.

555
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,000
Love beauty is a man's nature.

556
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,840
I'm just an ordinary man.

557
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,840
A man's nature.

558
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,520
Am I wrong?

559
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,160
Check mark.

560
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,240
Check mark.

561
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,480
Check mark.

562
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,440
Check mark.

563
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,000
Check mark.

564
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,360
Check mark.

565
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,920
Close the door!

566
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,660
Is it free?

567
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,960
Sure.

568
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,100
Okay.

569
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,580
nữa Germany

570
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,620

ten arrows.

577
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,480
Wait and see.

578
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,520
General, what are you doing?

579
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,000
I'll teach you archery.

580
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,040
No need.

581
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,160
I can do it myself.

582
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,180
Cut 3????

583
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:35,800
Good.

584
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,600
Great.

585
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,400
یں ATH.

586
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,640
Give it to me.

587
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,960
This is so cool.

588
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,520
Congratulations on Shivara.

589
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,440
She is indeed넣搞驚喜.

590
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:57,840
Handsome.

591
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,280
May I borrow your hair?

592
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,040
My hands are really about to fall out.

593
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,560
Awesome.

594
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,360
What is this?

595
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:30,080
Cheng Chunying and Bo Bardass the four young masters in Bypassing and Anyway Sheep.

596
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,840
Thank you, Miss.

597
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,840
I'll arrange it for you

598
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,840
Brother, we agreed to just have fun

599
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,840
You two are making me look bad

600
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,840
How do you want to make it harder?

601
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,840
We don't need to do it anymore

602
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,840
Brother, let's go to vote for the leader

603
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,840
I can't beat you in archery

604
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,840
I can beat you in this

605
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,840
To bet?

606
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,840
To bet is illegal, you can't bet

607
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,840
Then I won't bet

608
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,840
I won't go to the head of the village

609
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,840
I also heard that there is a fortune teller nearby

610
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,840
Very accurate

611
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,840
He can calculate the life and death of the people

612
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:32,840
The number of people is good

613
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,840
Half of the people

614
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,840
Just a swindler in the world

615
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,840
I also heard that he is very accurate in calculating fate

616
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:40,840
Just forget it

617
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,840
Where is it? Lead the way

618
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,840
Let's go, I'll take you there

619
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,840
Come

620
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,840
You two are a match made in heaven

621
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Thank you

622
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,840
Dear guests, do you want to guess the fate?

623
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,840
Let's both come first

624
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,840
I just saw a few familiar eyes

625
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,840
I didn't expect it to be you

626
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
I just make a nine-dollar

627
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,840
This guest, please look at your hand

628
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,840
Which hand? This hand, this hand

629
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:23,840
This, this hand

630
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,840
Come, come, come

631
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,840
You this

632
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,840
No hurry, no hurry

633
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:40,840
This guest

634
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,840
This

635
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,840
This

636
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:51,840
Dear guests

637
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,840
Thousand miles, a line of a line

638
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,840
Master

639
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,840
What is a professional?

640
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:09,840
This is a professional

641
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,840
Fate is hard to predict

642
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,840
What do you mean?

643
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,840
Heaven's chicken, heaven's chicken

644
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,840
Can't be leaked

645
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,840
I don't care what you are

646
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,840
Heaven's chicken or not

647
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,840
What is the solution?

648
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,840
80 taels of gold, one tael less

649
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,840
What?

650
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,840
Need to be paid with your body

651
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,840
80 taels

652
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,840
You are too heartless

653
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,840
Two red strings, 80 taels

654
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,840
Brother

655
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,840
Are those aunts

656
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:44,840
Arranged a blind date for you

657
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,840
To cover up your marriage

658
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,840
She went to a blind date?

659
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,840
Yes

660
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,840
The daughter of Su's family

661
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,840
Loves my brother so much

662
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,840
Where did Su

663
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,840
Then why are you still testing the marriage?

664
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840
Just find Su's daughter

665
00:37:58,840 --> 00:37:59,840
No, I

666
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,840
I don't know the daughter of Su's family

667
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,840
You are a bad mouth

668
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,840
I don't know

669
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,840
You are a bad mouth

670
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,840
You are a bad mouth

671
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,840
You are a bad mouth

672
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,840
Buqi, Buqi

673
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,840
Did I say something wrong?

674
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:15,840
Sir, take care

675
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,840
I'll come to you next time

676
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,840
Take care

677
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,840
Where are they?

678
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,840
Lost

679
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:41,840
I'm afraid the general

680
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:42,840
Have driven them away

681
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,840
Miss Wu Xian

682
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,840
What do you like most about this world?

683
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,840
What about you?

684
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:55,840
I like the fireworks in this world

685
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,840
Why?

686
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,840
The long smoke

687
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,840
The flowers bloom at the most mysterious time

688
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,840
But every time I see this firework

689
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,840
I will think of the falling flowers

690
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,840
The world of flowers

691
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,840
The long smoke

692
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,840
The flowers bloom at the most mysterious time

693
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:13,840
Maybe this is the most beautiful thing in my heart

694
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,840
If the world of flowers

695
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,840
I will marry you

696
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,840
It's a deal

697
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,840
I have a feeling

698
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,840
I feel these wishes

699
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,840
Have a life

700
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,840
Maybe that's the most important

701
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,840
Miss, what are you suffering from?

702
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:41,680
It is good to walk slowly in the past.

703
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:54,440
We have everyday lived together.

704
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:02,360
If it must be depending on people for once,

705
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:38,360
I will be with you in the wind and rain

706
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:44,360
Please change your name for a lifetime

707
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:51,360
I still remember that day when I was happy

708
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:57,360
I will be with you in the wind and rain

709
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:02,360
I still remember that day when I was happy

710
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:08,360
When the flowers bloom, the world is full of wishes

711
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:14,360
I will be with you in the wind and rain

712
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:20,360
I hope we can chase after our dreams

713
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:26,360
I hope we can dream of the future together

714
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:32,360
Even if time is merciless, we will never forget each other

715
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:40,360
We will remember each other in our next life
