Why did he buy me medicine?

Hongning, why are you here?

29
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I...

30
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Looking for Master?

31
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Oh

32
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
It's okay, you go ahead

33
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Since you are here, why don't you come in?

34
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Master, they said you were recuperating

35
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
So I didn't dare to disturb

36
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
What's the matter?

37
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
This is...

38
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I heard you have a wound on your body

39
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,000
This is the medicine I asked Senior Bai Ling to help me with

40
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's our secret recipe

41
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Bai is Bai Ling's

42
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I want to make them into medicine

43
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
This is my secret recipe

44
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I heard they can treat scabies

45
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Your nephew is scabies

46
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
You don't have to do this

47
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
These medicines are good for my wound

48
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Master, bad news

49
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
What is it?

50
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Someone came to the warehouse to make trouble

51
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Hand over Hongning!

52
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
We know what you said

53
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Calm down, calm down

54
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Calm down, calm down

55
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Calm down, calm down

56
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Calm down, calm down

57
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Give me Hongning back

58
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Give me Hongning back

59
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Master

60
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Hongning

61
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Master

62
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
It's you

63
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Who?

64
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't care who you are

65
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Hand over my daughter

66
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Otherwise, I'll have them tear your shoes

67
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Calm down, calm down

68
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Calm down

69
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,000
She... she saved our great benefactor

70
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
benefactor

71
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Hongning has been resting in my house

72
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Please come with me

73
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Okay

74
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Here

75
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
What's going on?

76
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
What's going on?

77
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
This is the tea from the god of wood in the back mountain

78
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Please enjoy

79
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Thank you

80
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
It's okay

81
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What are you doing?

82
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Wipe it clean

83
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Go

84
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Sorry to make you laugh

85
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I didn't expect that Hongning

86
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
came out secretly

87
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I'm sorry

88
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's okay

89
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Hongning

90
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
You haven't been home for so long

91
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm so worried

92
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Dad, mom, your son is fine

93
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Son?

94
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
What are you talking about?

95
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
Son, son, your son, me

96
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
What's wrong with your voice?

97
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Why are you dressed like this?

98
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Mom, I know you must be thinking

99
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I'm confused

100
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Of course, it's my fault

101
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
I went out without telling you

102
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
for so long

103
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
But as a man

104
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
you need to be successful

105
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
to support a family

106
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Right, dad?

107
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
What's wrong with you?

108
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
You don't understand

109
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
If you give me a son

110
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I can't stay in Cangwu mountain

111
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
I can't be a disciple

112
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
How can I practice?

113
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You can't practice?

114
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
If you have a daughter

115
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
you can't stay here, right?

116
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Right

117
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
What are you talking about?

118
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I don't understand

119
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Don't interrupt if you don't understand

120
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Son, you can stay here

121
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
What are you talking about?

122
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
You don't understand

123
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Don't mind

124
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
My parents are so casual

125
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't mind

126
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I don't mind

127
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Hongning is a girl

128
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Come, please

129
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
This guest room is so beautiful

130
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's so beautiful

131
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Dad, are you ok?

132
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You are so tall

133
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
You are like the head of our family

134
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Master

135
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
When did you find me?

136
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The first day you entered Cangwu

137
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Why didn't you expose me?

138
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Wait, Senior Bai Ling

139
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
Leave it to me

140
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You go first

141
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
Ok

142
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Eat

143
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I beg you, how is your master?

144
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I sent it

145
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
Don't worry

146
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You are good

147
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
You know Master and Senior Hu Li

148
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Why didn't you come to Cangwu earlier?

149
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
You should have stayed in the guest room earlier

150
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
You are so weird

151
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
How dare I?

152
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
You know so many people

153
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What if Senior Hu Li comes to me again?

154
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Can you talk normally?

155
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I thought you were so reliable

156
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
You didn't know anyone

157
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Ridiculous

158
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Bai Ling

159
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
You haven't changed at all

160
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
You are so good

161
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
You haven't changed at all

162
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You are so good at talking

163
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
You are like you knew me before

164
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I don't know what you are talking about

165
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
If you can't talk normally, get out

166
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Ok

167
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Ok

168
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I was afraid you would be discovered by the heavenly soldiers

169
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I saved you in Cangwu

170
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I saved you in Cangwu

171
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
I saved you food and money

172
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I was afraid you would be discovered

173
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Ok

174
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Now you know me

175
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You don't need me, right?

176
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
I will go

177
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Hey

178
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Junior

179
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
What's wrong?

180
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Why are you so sad?

181
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
Are you scolded by the master?

182
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You are so fragile

183
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I made a mistake

184
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I broke the rules of Cangwu mountain

185
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I broke the rules of Cangwu mountain

186
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
You broke it

187
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I tell you

188
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
There are 108 rules in Cangwu school

189
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I broke 500 of them

190
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I am standing here now

191
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
But I broke the most important rules of Cangwu mountain

192
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
You killed someone?

193
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
No

194
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
You stole something?

195
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I stole your token

196
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I

197
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
I

198
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I

199
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
This token

200
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's so valuable

201
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
Right?

202
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
It's ok

203
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
I stole the money from the master

204
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Now I am fine

205
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Actually I

206
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
What are you doing?

207
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
Wang Huning

208
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
You are a girl

209
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
You are a girl

210
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Please go to the hall with me

211
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
What are you doing?

212
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
How can you do this?

213
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
You are a girl?

214
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
A girl?

215
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Huning

216
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Do you know your mistake?

217
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
It's my fault

218
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I am a girl

219
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
A girl

220
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
A girl

221
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Oh, no

222
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Something bad happened to Cangwu

223
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's my rule

224
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
You came to Cangwu

225
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
What's your purpose?

226
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Actually I

227
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
It's all because of me

228
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
It's none of your business

229
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
Huning is my good friend

230
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
He misunderstood

231
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
He thought I was taken away by Bai Ling

232
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
So he pretended to be a man to save me

233
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Actually it's Bai Ling's fault

234
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
It's my fault

235
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
The lemon water

236
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
It's not my fault

237
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You two came back together

238
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You stole my body

239
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
You used your lemon juice

240
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
to spray me

241
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
I have a good reason

242
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
And what are you afraid of in Cangwu?

243
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
What are you afraid of?

244
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
It's about

245
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Lu Jiu

246
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
He has been standing outside our village for so many years

247
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
He is so fierce

248
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
He is so scary when people mention Cangwu

249
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Lu Jiu

250
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's you

251
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Why did you blame me?

252
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Master

253
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
It's all my fault

254
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'm a loser

255
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,000
It's all my fault

256
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
Okay, okay, stand up

257
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Huning

258
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Although we can understand that you are trying to save your friend

259
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
But you did destroy Cangwu's iron law

260
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
According to the rules

261
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
You are not allowed to go to Cangwu

262
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
You are not allowed to go to Cangwu

263
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
According to the rules

264
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You have to leave Cangwu

265
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
What's wrong with the girl?

266
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
What's wrong with the girl?

267
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
What's wrong with the girl?

268
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Thank you, master

269
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Uncle

270
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
And

271
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
Thank you for taking care of me

272
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Who said Cangwu didn't take care of the girl?

273
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
Who said Cangwu didn't take care of the girl?

274
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Come out and fight with me

275
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Forget it

276
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
Since you have a lot of doubts

277
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Since you have a lot of doubts

278
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Then let's change the way

279
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
Then let's change the way

280
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Master

281
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Master

282
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
As you know

283
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Cangwu has been looking for an ancestor

284
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
For thousands of years

285
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Only men and not women

286
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
But now the time has passed

287
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
And there are many problems

288
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
So today we will discuss

289
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
So today we will discuss

290
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
The vote of most students

291
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
To decide whether to keep this ancestor

292
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Each of your votes

293
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Are about the future of Cangwu's development

294
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
Are about the future of Cangwu's development

295
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
And will redefine

296
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Our friendship

297
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Next

298
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Zheng Fang first

299
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I'll go first

300
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
I still follow the principle

301
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Of keeping men and not women

302
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
The reason is simple

303
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Because this rule is set by our ancestors

304
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
The so-called lawlessness

305
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
If this rule is broken

306
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
What other rules can't be broken?

307
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Right?

308
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
I

309
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Bai Ling

310
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
The representative of the lawlessness of Cangwu

311
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
If I keep following the rules

312
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I have been expelled from Cangwu

313
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
From now on

314
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
There will be one less excellent master

315
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
So maybe

316
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
There will be one more devil

317
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
The reason why this happened

318
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Of course

319
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
It also depends on the forgiveness

320
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Of all the teachers

321
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
This means the rule is dead

322
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
People are alive

323
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I hope everyone

324
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Votes your precious votes to me

325
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Otherwise I can't promise

326
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
I will do something

327
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
What a sad thing

328
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Bai Ling

329
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Yes

330
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
Come on

331
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
The rule is the rule

332
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Can't break

333
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
Gone

334
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
Gone

335
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
What?

336
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
What did I say?

337
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
No, no, no

338
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It's good

339
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
Just repeat what I said

340
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I'm emphasizing

341
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Hong Ning

342
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Now you can say your last words

343
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
This is the information given by Baibu Qu

344
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
It's all real

345
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
I want to say three things

346
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
The first point is written in the book

347
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
Men and women together practice Tao

348
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
It's a common thing

349
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Men practice Qian Dao

350
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Women practice Kun Dao

351
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Many schools of practice accept men and women at the same time

352
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
And the second point

353
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Baibu Qu has been checked

354
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
A lot of facts

355
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
In fact, the first female students of Cangwu School

356
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
It's a misunderstanding

357
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
About five hundred years ago

358
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,000
The Taoist temple was a Taoist temple

359
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
But because male and female students can't live together

360
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
So two temples were built

361
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
And the third point

362
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I think like Cangwu School

363
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
The school in the world

364
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
Should not be divided into men and women

365
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Give each cultivator a chance to do good

366
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
Good

367
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Yes

368
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
Everyone

369
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Do you have anything else to add?

370
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Tian Danxing, Lu Jiu

371
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Do you two still insist

372
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Hong Ning can't stay on the mountain

373
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Although she is a woman

374
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
But it doesn't seem to affect us

375
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
Yes

376
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Yes

377
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Yes

378
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
Yes

379
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Very careful

380
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
I think it's good to have a junior

381
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
Wenxing

382
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
As their teacher

383
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
What do you think?

384
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
Master, I just remember

385
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Since the establishment of Cangwu School

386
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
There is a rule

387
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Cangwu does not accept female students

388
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
The next to Xu Yunguan does not accept male students

389
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
But I don't know

390
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Cangwu Mountain and Xu Yunguan

391
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:11,980
I'm too

392
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Why should we have a rule about the division of men and women?

393
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
The way of the foundation of Cangwu

394
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
Is cultivating the fairy

395
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
Not the rule

396
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
Besides

397
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
Cangwu rules need to be adjusted

398
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Because of the matter of Hong Ning

399
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
As an opportunity

400
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,360
and we took it out to trade.

401
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,760
Now the result

402
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,400
is what we discussed together.

403
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,680
I guess

404
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,320
you are convinced.

405
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,840
It's my fault.

406
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,440
I knew from the beginning

407
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,480
that Hong Ning's real identity

408
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,440
is a girl.

409
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,400
I wanted to send her down the mountain

410
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,960
and leave her on the mountain

411
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,320
because of the monster's mess.

412
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,560
Then

413
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,200
Hong Ning found the weapon

414
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,240
and took her as her disciple.

415
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,960
So

416
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,000
I was also punished.

417
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,960
Master, you are right.

418
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,920
Yes, I am right.

419
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:12,200
Then why can't Hong Ning

420
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,080
be right?

421
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,720
Master,

422
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,760
if there are any irregularities in the future,

423
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,640
can we also make a proposal?

424
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,880
Of course.

425
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,440
So today I announce

426
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,440
the ban on the female disciple

427
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,280
from Cang Wu Mountain.

428
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,040
Dismiss.

429
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,840
Good.

430
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:36,840
If the judge

431
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,160
comes after us in the future,

432
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,840
I will take the responsibility.

433
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,680
Thank you, Master.

434
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,040
Wang Hong Ning,

435
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,280
you are too hasty.

436
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:56,880
You have been away from home alone for so long.

437
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,520
Do you know how worried your father is about you?

438
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,120
Mom, I am sorry.

439
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,360
I didn't tell you in advance.

440
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,120
I ran out alone.

441
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,800
Is this something to talk about?

442
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,640
There are so many monsters in Cang Wu Mountain.

443
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,080
You came here alone?

444
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,680
What are you thinking?

445
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,880
Even if you want to save someone,

446
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,720
you have to think about it for a long time.

447
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,960
Enough, enough, enough.

448
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,640
Other children are too fierce.

449
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,880
Children want to save friends.

450
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,520
It's not possible.

451
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,400
Besides,

452
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,280
I don't think Cang Wu

453
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,600
is that scary, right?

454
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,040
Yes.

455
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:28,880
Hong Ning,

456
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,440
your mother is right.

457
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,080
No matter how dangerous it is,

458
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,880
you can't leave without telling me.

459
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,880
Yes, yes, yes.

460
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,680
Mom, I was wrong.

461
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:38,880
I shouldn't have done that.

462
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,080
I shouldn't have done that.

463
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,880
You can admit your mistake.

464
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,080
You know you were wrong.

465
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,280
Come here.

466
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:48,480
You have to stay.

467
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,680
Don't you always dislike cultivating?

468
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:52,880
Is there something you can't say?

469
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,080
No, mom.

470
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,680
Don't worry.

471
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,880
I have something to do.

472
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,680
I'll go home after I'm done.

473
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,680
Okay?

474
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,080
I support you.

475
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,880
Mom, don't worry.

476
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,880
Hong Ning is here.

477
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,280
Hong Ning, Hong Ning.

478
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,280
Let me do it.

479
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,680
Here, have some tea to warm your throat.

480
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,080
Hong Ning.

481
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,280
For me?

482
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,880
For you.

483
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,680
Thank you, Senior.

484
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,080
Bai Buquan.

485
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
Something bad happened.

486
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,480
Why is everyone so nice to me?

487
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,080
Don't get so close to me.

488
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,080
Yesterday, Senior had a meeting with me.

489
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,680
Bai Buquan.

490
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,080
How many times have I told you?

491
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,280
The practice room needs to be quiet.

492
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,480
Go get the punishment.

493
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,880
Yes.

494
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,080
Wait.

495
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,080
I was the one who talked to him.

496
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,280
The medicine is wet.

497
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,280
I'll go up with him.

498
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,280
No, no, no.

499
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,480
You're a girl.

500
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,280
How can you get punished?

501
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,280
Come here.

502
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,480
A girl should be good at everything.

503
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,280
Come, sit.

504
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,880
Hong Ning is here.

505
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,080
Hong Ning is here.

506
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,480
Hong Ning, Hong Ning.

507
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,480
Hong Ning, Hong Ning.

508
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,080
Senior.

509
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,680
I'm so sorry for treating you like that.

510
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,680
Hong Ning, it was our fault.

511
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,480
Hong Ning, if you have any clothes in the future,

512
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,480
we'll wash them for you.

513
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,280
Yes, yes.

514
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,880
Everyone, why are you so polite today?

515
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,880
Come.

516
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,480
Let me ask you.

517
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,080
Do you go down the mountain often?

518
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,880
Like the people in Pudu?

519
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,080
Of course.

520
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,280
When I first entered Cangwu,

521
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,480
I followed you to go down the mountain and catch demons.

522
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:37,680
You went to Wangjia Village?

523
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,680
Of course.

524
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,480
You go down the mountain and catch demons.

525
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,880
You'll go to Wangjia Village no matter how far you go.

526
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,480
What did he do?

527
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,080
He stayed in the forest for a while.

528
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,480
Then he stood in the distance and watched.

529
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,480
Then he left.

530
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,280
Left?

531
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,680
Hong Ning, Master is looking for you.

532
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,480
Looking for me?

533
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:18,280
Master, are you looking for me?

534
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,480
This is your cultivation talisman.

535
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,280
You don't need to dress up as a man in the future.

536
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:26,280
You can cultivate in Cangwu in a decent way.

537
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,080
Thank you, Master.

538
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,080
What's wrong?

539
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:45,880
Actually, I'm not interested in cultivating.

540
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,680
There is a reason why I stayed.

541
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,480
You really don't like cultivating?

542
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,480
Cultivating is too cold.

543
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,480
I still like to stay in the mortal world.

544
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,080
The mortal world is lively.

545
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,680
The mortal world has feelings and meaning.

546
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,880
There are many, many interesting things in the mortal world.

547
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,880
So what if there are feelings?

548
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,480
A mortal will die of old age and illness.

549
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,480
Soon he will forget his feelings completely.

550
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,280
Isn't that also heartless?

551
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,480
Forgetting doesn't mean that it's not there.

552
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,080
As long as there is love,

553
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:23,080
it doesn't mean that it's heartless.

554
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,080
Actually, a immortal

555
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:28,080
is not as heartless as you think.

556
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,080
Master, why do you want me to cultivate?

557
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,080
Because you are born with a deep heart.

558
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,080
Just because of this?

559
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,080
The immortal path is eternal.

560
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,080
What if I only fight for the future?

561
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,080
Master,

562
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,080
Master,

563
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,080
actually, I have always wanted to ask you a question.

564
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,080
Go ahead.

565
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:59,080
Do you know me from the past?

566
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,080
When I was young, I was always in danger.

567
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,080
There was always someone who was secretly protecting me.

568
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,080
Is that you?

569
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,080
No.

570
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,080
I think it's you.

571
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:41,080
When I was young, I often had a dream.

572
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,080
In my dream,

573
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:46,080
I saw a person who looked like a flower.

574
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,080
I didn't know what he looked like.

575
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,080
But he was standing on top of the flower bed.

576
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,080
He was very beautiful.

577
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:57,080
It was the same as when I saw you.

578
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,080
I'm not as good as you think.

579
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,080
Although we have known each other for a long time,

580
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:10,080
but since I saw you for the first time,

581
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,080
I felt very close.

582
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,080
Sometimes, I felt very happy.

583
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:22,080
Sometimes, I felt a little anxious.

584
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:25,080
I don't know if it's because we knew each other in the past

585
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:29,080
or because you came into my dream.

586
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:34,080
It's just a dream.

587
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,080
Why bother with a dream?

588
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:39,080
Even if it's a dream, it's very real.

589
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:42,080
No matter how real it is, it's just a dream.

590
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,080
Even if it's just a dream, I'm willing to believe it.

591
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:51,080
I'm afraid that one day, I'll lose the person in my dream.

592
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:55,080
I'm afraid that one day, I won't be able to see him.

593
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,080
Why?

594
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,080
Why do you have to be so picky about a dream?

595
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:08,080
What is it? What if it's not?

596
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:11,080
Are you going to marry him to repay his kindness?

597
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,080
I don't have any other intentions.

598
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:19,080
I'm just thinking that if one day,

599
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,080
I can meet him,

600
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:26,080
I want to say thank you to him face to face.

601
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,080
I'm sorry.

602
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,080
What's wrong, Senior Brother?

603
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,080
Master Fox hasn't returned yet.

604
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,080
Before he came, he couldn't stay in Wang Village and you were always in the dark.

605
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:17,080
He said he would find medicine for Master and never returned.

606
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,080
What is this?

607
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,080
It's Fox Blood.

608
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,080
Something happened to Senior Brother Fox.

609
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,080
There's more.

610
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,080
Let's go.

611
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,080
Let's go.

612
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:54,080
The blood should be here.

613
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,080
It should be in front.

614
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,080
Forget it.

615
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,080
It's already dark. Your magic power is low.

616
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,080
Let's go back to the school.

617
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:02,080
Otherwise, Master will be worried again.

618
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,080
I'm not going back.

619
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,080
Master is cold. He won't worry.

620
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,080
And there's so much blood on the road.

621
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,080
I'm not at ease.

622
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,080
Did you have a fight?

623
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,080
No.

624
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:17,080
If there was no fight, how would you know who I'm worried about?

625
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,080
You're not leaving. If you don't leave, I'll leave by myself.

626
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,080
Wait.

627
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,080
What is this?

628
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,080
This is too big. I'm afraid of getting lost.

629
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,080
Let's make a mark first.

630
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,080
What do you think?

631
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,080
Do you think I'm smart?

632
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,080
Is it okay?

633
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,080
Senior Brother, is this mark useful?

634
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,080
Why is it getting bigger and bigger?

635
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,080
Don't underestimate your senior brother.

636
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,080
The Fox Blood is definitely nearby.

637
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:10,080
Let's go back.

638
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,080
Help.

639
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,080
Help.

640
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,080
Little monster.

641
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,080
The rabbit demon?

642
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:43,080
Help! The demon!

643
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,080
The demon!

644
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,080
The demon!

645
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:07,080
What kind of demon can scare the demon?

646
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,080
There must be a big demon here.

647
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:21,080
Little disciple, can you tell that this is a rabbit demon?

648
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,080
Which side?

649
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:28,080
I'm from the North Sea, my name is Dongxuan Zhenren.

650
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:29,080
Dongxuan Zhenren?

651
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,080
The one who is known as the Fairy of the North Sea?

652
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,080
Why are you here?

653
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,080
I'm going to visit Xu Yun Temple.

654
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:40,080
Are you from the Cangwu Mountain?

655
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,080
I'm Bai Ling from Cangwu Academy, this is my junior sister, Hong Ning.

656
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:54,080
I heard that the Cangwu Academy has a female disciple.

657
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,080
It's you.

658
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,080
Thank you.

659
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,080
The rabbit demon didn't show up before he died.

660
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,080
How did you know that it was a demon?

661
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,080
I've seen demons since I was a child.

662
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,080
That's strange.

663
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,080
The demon aura here is very strong and there are many dangers.

664
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:18,080
What are you two doing here?

665
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,080
One of our senior brothers has disappeared.

666
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,080
We followed his blood to come here.

667
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,080
Did you find anything suspicious around here?

668
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:32,080
I was just about to run away from the rabbit demon.

669
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,080
Then I met you.

670
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:37,080
Since you are in such a dangerous place,

671
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:40,080
I'm willing to go with you.

672
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:45,080
Okay, let's go find Senior Brother Lu Jiu together.

673
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:49,080
But it's getting dark, so the demon aura is stronger.

674
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,080
I saw a missing room in the village.

675
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:55,080
Why don't we stay overnight and leave tomorrow morning?

676
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,080
Okay.

677
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,080
No, no, no.

678
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,080
But Senior Brother Lu Jiu...

679
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,080
But what?

680
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,080
It's getting dark.

681
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:04,040
If we break into the room again, we'll be the ones who will be sent to the

682
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:06,080
death.

683
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,080
Keep this letter for Senior Brother Lu.

684
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,080
When he comes, we'll look for him together.

685
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,080
Thank you, Senior Brother.

686
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,080
Thank you.

687
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,080
The love story of the sea

688
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:06,080
is full of happiness

689
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:13,080
The flowers bloom, the world is full of love

690
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:19,080
I'll accompany you to the end of the world to watch the wind and rain

691
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:26,080
I can chase after you with all my strength

692
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:33,080
You can easily follow the sound of the sound of the dream

693
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:39,080
Even if the night is endless, I will not forget

694
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:46,080
This life is like a dream, like a dream
