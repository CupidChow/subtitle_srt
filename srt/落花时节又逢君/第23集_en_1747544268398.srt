1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The Loss of Light

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Episode 14

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,000
There is no barrier here.

4
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
You won't be discovered.

5
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Just tell me directly.

6
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Also, I have no right to be known.

7
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I know that you are the one who did this.

8
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
You are the one who did this.

9
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
I know that you are the one who did this.

10
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I know that you are the one who did this.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I know that you are the one who did this.

12
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You won't be discovered.

13
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Just tell me directly.

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I just want to know

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
if you did something to the bracelet.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You mean the bracelet that was stolen

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
from the Heaven Book?

18
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's really you.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Jinxiu, I didn't give you the bracelet.

20
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
You violated the Heaven Rules and stole it.

21
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
After stealing it, you gave it to the Red Tea Demon.

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Why are you here today to ask me about this?

23
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,240
I asked the Heaven Book Honorable to get the Demon-Penetrating

24
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,000
thing that locked the Red Tea Demon.

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
How could it produce such a huge power to counteract?

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,000
If you are at ease and don't go back to Zhong Tian,

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
how could this happen?

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Jinxiu,

29
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
the Heaven Book Honorable warned you many times

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
that if you defy the Heaven, you will be counteracted.

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He has the result today.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
How could you blame others?

33
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
If you weren't greedy for love,

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
the Red Tea Demon could have been a mortal.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
If you didn't go to harass him,

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
how could he destroy you?

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I didn't kill him.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
It's you.

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Today's result is the consequence that you must bear.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
You are the future Heavenly Emperor.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Why bother to fight against the life and death of the Demon?

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Those people in Cangwu Mountain

43
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
suffered from the Three-Mirror Acid Fire.

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
They were burnt and in pain.

45
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
You are just a place to let them free.

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
If you didn't let the Heavenly Army to kill Cangwu Mountain,

47
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
how could Cangwu Mountain be destroyed?

48
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's not my intention to be destroyed.

49
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I ordered the Imperial Physician to not interfere.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
As long as you bring the Red Tea Demon back,

51
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
he will do anything for the Demon Lord.

52
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
He even killed the Demon of Cangwu Mountain.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
As a God,

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
he did the most wrong thing.

55
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Since we are talking about this,

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I will tell you.

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Even if he is your master,

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
he killed the Demon of Cangwu Mountain.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I will not let him die.

60
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Pass the order.

61
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Yes.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The Imperial Physician will be the next immortal

63
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and escort him to the lower realm.

64
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes.

65
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Father.

66
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
If you could light up the Star of Heavenly Emperor earlier,

67
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
you would have been more careful.

68
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
How could you be involved

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
in this situation?

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Father, I only wish the world to be peaceful.

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
As the Heavenly Emperor,

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I will do everything I can

73
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
to put my power and power

74
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
above others' pain.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I will not accept

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
the position of Heavenly Emperor.

77
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Master.

78
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Master.

79
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
What happened?

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Jinxiu.

81
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I hope you can protect Zhong Tian

82
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
as the Heavenly Emperor.

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Master.

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Master.

85
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Master.

86
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Master.

87
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Master.

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Master.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Master.

90
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Master.

91
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Master.

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Master.

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Master.

94
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Master.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Master.

96
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Master.

97
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Master.

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Master.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Master.

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Master.

101
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Master.

102
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Master.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Master.

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Master.

105
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Master.

106
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Master.

107
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Master.

108
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Master.

109
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Master.

110
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Master.

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Master.

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Master.

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Master.

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Master.

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Master.

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
When we are together,

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I will feel painful and anxious tutorial.

118
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I Protection you,

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,440
but selfishly

120
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,440
wanted you to be by my side.

121
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,600
In the end,

122
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,240
I still hurt you.

123
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,640
heartbroken

124
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,560
Maybe

125
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,280
Little there is a back

126
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,280
Only if you stay away,

127
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,960
go to a place without me,

128
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,320
workflow to full happiness.

129
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
There's an emergency.

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Kunlun Jun is...

131
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
What happened?

132
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Kunlun Jun is fighting with the Heavenly Officer at Yehuo Bridge.

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I'm begging you, Kunlun Jun.

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
If this continues,

135
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
the entire Liuzhuo's stone formation will be ruined.

136
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I said,

137
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
either I go there with my brothers,

138
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
or I won't go.

139
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This...

140
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
This...

141
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Liuzhuo's life and death is all in his hands.

142
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
How can I do this?

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't have the ability.

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Right?

145
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Then I really won't go.

146
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Then hit me again.

147
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Heavenly Empress.

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What are you doing?

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
The man on the bridge is my senior brother.

150
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I can't wait for them to cross the bridge

151
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
and get back together.

152
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
How can I be fooling around?

153
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Do you know that you and Jinxiu

154
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
are both the Star of Heaven and Earth?

155
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
The Star of Heaven and Earth of you two

156
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
will be shining forever.

157
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
You will die for your senior brother.

158
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You will be jealous.

159
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You will definitely become the emperor.

160
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
The next time is the most important.

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
You don't have to care about your brother's feelings.

162
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
All of this is just a passing memory.

163
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
There won't be any memories anyway.

164
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
So what if there's only one thing?

165
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
They are kind to me.

166
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I should have watched them cross the bridge.

167
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
They are right.

168
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
They are not the sacrifice of the Heavens.

169
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The emperor of the Heavens

170
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
is going to step on the body of the sacrifice.

171
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
How can he be so kind and loving?

172
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I never thought about being the star of heaven and earth.

173
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I never thought about being the emperor.

174
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I should persuade my brother more.

175
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
You!

176
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Master.

177
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
The Star of Heaven and Earth is not completed yet.

178
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
It's almost time.

179
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Please finish the flow of the flow.

180
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Where is the person from the Cangwu Mountain?

181
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,000
He is in the center of the moon and the earth.

182
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
He is the one who is the most important.

183
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
The shadow is dark and the cloud is long.

184
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Thank you, Meng He.

185
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
In the future, I will return the favor to the King of Heaven.

186
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I promise.

187
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,000
A book of flowers is a quiver in the autumn.

188
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:28,000
His dress is also a candlelight.

189
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
The shadow is dark and the cloud is long.

190
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,000
If the shadow is dark and the cloud is long,

191
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
who will be the one to protect the Heavens?

192
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Why is Lu Cheng here?

193
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
The three foxes in the Northern Immortal Realm,

194
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Cangwu Mountain and Yin Yin,

195
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
are very guilty and committed suicide.

196
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I know that you are not the one.

197
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I know that you are not the one.

198
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I never forget.

199
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I never forget.

200
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I never forget.

201
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I never forget.

202
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I never forget.

203
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I never forget.

204
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Whether you are the emperor or not,

205
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
you can't be.

206
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
The time has come.

207
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It must be over.

208
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:28,180
The

209
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I look forward to the old man's coming.

210
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I'm not afraid of the wind and the waves.

211
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
When I return, I will never forget.

212
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,740
Hewla Wini horrific

213
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,640
Wo sig Arney

214
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Your Majesty .

215
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
What's up?

216
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,200
I took the scene from the fall of Heavens.

217
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,700
The part I took from him is his monument,

218
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,000
and I saw Jinshu.

219
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You all know

220
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,440
Why do you ask?

221
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,120
You don't care about

222
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,760
Kunlun's rule.

223
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,240
Now,

224
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,240
Jinxiu doesn't care about the rule of the Star of Heaven and Earth,

225
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,360
and returns to the Celestial Court without permission.

226
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,480
You even cover for him.

227
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,920
The Star of Heaven and Earth has its own rules.

228
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,640
The Star of Heaven and Earth failed in both.

229
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,720
You only care about Jinxiu.

230
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,520
What do you mean?

231
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:56,560
Fine.

232
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,720
I'll ask again.

233
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,400
Who is Jinxiu's master?

234
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,400
Enough!

235
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,280
I'll say it again.

236
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,920
Don't ask again.

237
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,640
For ten thousand years,

238
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,120
Jinxiu has been your mother.

239
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,720
You not only treated her,

240
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,880
but also called her like this today.

241
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,720
I...

242
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,840
I said she is a traitor.

243
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,880
Am I wrong?

244
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,280
I gave birth to Kunlun's rule that day.

245
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,800
But you brought her back in my tomb.

246
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,840
You even called her your twin.

247
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,760
Are you worthy of me?

248
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:51,880
It's been ten thousand years.

249
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,240
Can't you let it go?

250
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,800
Who is the fairy you were born with?

251
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,440
Why do you have to inherit the throne?

252
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,600
You still don't want to tell me the truth?

253
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,360
There are things

254
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,680
you don't need to know.

255
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,640
I don't have time to know the truth from now on.

256
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,840
Don't listen to any野洲.

257
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,040
Your Majesty is our empress Jinxiu.

258
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,440
You will always be ourhun happy with maidservants.

259
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:34,880
It's fine.

260
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:36,640
Okay?

261
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,000
Okay.

262
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:50,920
Since guy of Wild Extinction

263
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,920
Take her here.

264
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,920
Don't alert Zhong Tian.

265
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,920
Yes.

266
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,920
Go.

267
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
My son's future life

268
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,920
is all up to you.

269
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,920
Hurry.

270
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,920
Go after her.

271
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:25,920
Stop.

272
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,920
Stop.

273
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:31,920
Stop.

274
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:33,920
Stop.

275
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,920
Stop.

276
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,920
Stop.

277
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:36,920
Stop.

278
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,920
Stop.

279
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,920
Stop.

280
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,920
Stop.

281
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,920
Stop.

282
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:09,920
Greetings, Your Majesty.

283
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,920
Rise.

284
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,920
Your wound is almost healed.

285
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,920
You will recover soon.

286
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,920
Thank you for your help.

287
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,920
I didn't expect that

288
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:19,920
the Northern Immortal Realm

289
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,920
would be in such a state.

290
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,920
You have been in contact with Zhong Tian

291
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
frequently.

292
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,920
Zhong Tian owes you.

293
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,920
I should save you.

294
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,920
Thank you for your care.

295
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,920
I am grateful

296
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,920
for your help.

297
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,920
But what Zhong Tian did to me

298
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,920
is unforgivable.

299
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,920
It's unforgivable.

300
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:46,920
I can't forgive you.

301
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,920
I used to think

302
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,920
you are a little

303
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,920
like me.

304
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,920
Then I opened the door.

305
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,920
I don't care

306
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,920
about your grudge with Zhong Tian.

307
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,920
I saved you

308
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,920
because I have something to ask you.

309
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,920
Your Majesty, it's okay.

310
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,920
Kunlun Jun is the star of the world.

311
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,920
He is the best.

312
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,920
I can't interfere.

313
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:17,920
So I hope you can help him.

314
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:21,920
I...

315
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,920
If you can help Kunlun Jun

316
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,820
to complete the

317
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:29,920
position of the Queen of Heaven,

318
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:33,920
I will help you to regain the Northern Immortal Realm.

319
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,920
I will do my best.

320
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,920
Okay.

321
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,920
This is the transfer order

322
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,920
I prepared for you.

323
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:47,920
I have given you the blessing.

324
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,920
The people of the Northern Immortal Realm

325
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,920
won't find you.

326
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,920
You take the red thread

327
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,920
to Yehuo Bridge

328
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,920
to find Kunlun Jun.

329
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,920
This red thread

330
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,920
can hold your future fate.

331
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,920
I have told you.

332
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,920
They have left.

333
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:06,920
Why don't you believe me?

334
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,920
What if you lie to me?

335
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:09,920
I will kill you.

336
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,920
Hu.

337
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,920
Heavenly Maid.

338
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,920
Why are you here?

339
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,920
Lu Jiu and Jingxiu

340
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,920
are involved in the conflict.

341
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:20,920
The star of the world is involved.

342
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:21,920
I can't interfere.

343
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,920
If I want to get back to Jiu,

344
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,920
I have to go there

345
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,920
and fight with him.

346
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,920
Then I can go with you.

347
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:30,920
That's great.

348
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:33,920
Really?

349
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:36,920
But

350
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,920
I have to wait

351
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,380
for the

352
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,920
transfer order.

353
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:45,920
Actually,

354
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,920
there is another way.

355
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:48,920
What is it?

356
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,920
What are you doing?

357
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,920
Lu Yao.

358
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,920
I don't want to live.

359
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,920
What are you doing?

360
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,920
Let's go.

361
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,920
Oh my god.

362
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,920
Don't do it again.

363
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,920
Heng Ning.

364
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:41,920
I found the Nyingbo Bead for you.

365
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,920
Tonight,

366
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,920
you can recover your body.

367
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:09,920
I'm sorry.

368
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,920
I'm sorry.

369
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,920
I'm sorry.

370
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:15,920
I'm sorry.

371
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,920
I'm sorry.

372
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:19,920
I'm sorry.

373
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:21,920
I'm sorry.

374
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,920
I'm sorry.

375
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,920
I'm sorry.

376
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,920
I'm sorry.

377
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:29,920
I'm sorry.

378
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,920
I'm sorry.

379
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,920
I'm sorry.

380
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,920
I'm sorry.

381
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:36,920
I'm sorry.

382
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,920
I'm sorry.

383
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,920
I'm sorry.

384
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:42,920
I'm sorry.

385
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:44,920
I'm sorry.

386
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,920
I'm sorry.

387
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,920
I'm sorry.

388
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:50,920
I'm sorry.

389
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,920
I'm sorry.

390
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:54,920
I'm sorry.

391
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,920
I'm sorry.

392
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,920
I'm sorry.

393
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:00,920
I'm sorry.

394
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,920
I'm sorry.

395
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,920
I'm sorry.

396
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:06,920
I'm sorry.

397
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,920
Please, everyone.

398
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,920
I'm sorry.

399
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,920
I'm sorry.

400
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,920
I'm sorry.

401
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
I'm sorry.

402
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:30,920
Sorry.

403
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:33,920
I'm sorry.

404
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:51,060
who really came from

405
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,060
You two.

406
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,060
Thank you.

407
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,060
What?

408
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,060
You are not giving me the honor?

409
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,060
Or you think my maidservant

410
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,060
is not pretty enough?

411
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,060
Your Highness, you should take care of your health.

412
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,060
It's strange.

413
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,060
Recently, I feel

414
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,060
my health is getting worse.

415
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,060
A useless doctor

416
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,060
can't find out

417
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,060
what illness I have.

418
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:45,060
Useless.

419
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,060
Li Zhong.

420
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,060
Your Highness.

421
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,060
I will make an appointment

422
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,060
to take that useless doctor

423
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,060
out tomorrow

424
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,060
and kill him.

425
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:59,060
Yes. Your Highness, the imperial doctor is not a fool.

426
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,060
Useless is a fool.

427
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,060
Recently, I heard

428
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:07,060
there were many people

429
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:09,060
who died in the city

430
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,060
and even hundreds of people

431
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,060
died in the palace.

432
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:15,060
Your Highness,

433
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,060
you are the general of the Ministry of Law.

434
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,060
Don't

435
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,060
make me lose patience

436
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:25,060
like those useless officials.

437
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,060
Don't blame me for not reminding you

438
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:31,060
that with your current official position,

439
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,060
if you make a mistake,

440
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:35,060
you will destroy the Jiuzu clan.

441
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,060
I promise you

442
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:43,060
that from tomorrow on,

443
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:45,060
you can not come to the court to ask for my safety.

444
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,060
Just take care of

445
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,060
the demon in the city.

446
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,060
Xiaoyao.

447
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,060
Come.

448
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,060
Come.

449
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,060
Who doesn't know that Fang Yuan Baili

450
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,060
did evil things?

451
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,060
The person who killed him is definitely

452
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,060
unbearable.

453
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:20,060
He committed suicide?

454
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,060
How could it be? He must have done many evil things

455
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:24,060
and received retribution.

456
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,060
Do you want him to die like this?

457
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,060
Who doesn't want him to die?

458
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,060
The person who killed him is a living immortal.

459
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,060
With some money,

460
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,060
the uncle is a magistrate

461
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,060
and he is always rude.

462
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,060
Now he is dying because of retribution.

463
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,060
It's better if you can't explain it clearly.

464
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,060
Why do you explain so much to him?

465
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,060
He might not understand even if you explain it.

466
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,060
Look at his clothes.

467
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,060
He is a big official.

468
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:50,060
He might not be a good person.

469
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:52,060
You can make it louder. I can hear you.

470
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:10,060
General.

471
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:12,060
You are destroying the city.

472
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:14,060
You are scaring the people.

473
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,060
Go back and reflect on yourself.

474
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,060
Yes.

475
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,060
Go and investigate.

476
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,060
General, what is there to investigate?

477
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,060
The people only know those things.

478
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:26,060
But I just understood it.

479
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:28,060
If you ask me, I will tell you.

480
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,060
I will tell you.

481
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,060
General,

482
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,060
I will tell you.

483
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,060
I will tell you.

484
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,060
Do you understand?

485
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,060
If you ask me, I will tell you.

486
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,060
His name is Zheng Ke.

487
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:44,060
He is a rich businessman.

488
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,060
He is arrogant and arrogant.

489
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:48,060
He is a good person.

490
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:50,060
He is a bad person.

491
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,060
He is a bad person.

492
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,060
He is a bad person.

493
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,060
General, let's go back.

494
00:26:58,060 --> 00:27:00,060
He didn't kill himself.

495
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:02,060
He was hanged on his back.

496
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,060
There are so many enemies.

497
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,060
We can just deal with him.

498
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,060
It's none of our business.

499
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,060
It's not that simple.

500
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,060
I'm afraid his real cause of death

501
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,060
is drowning and dying.

502
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:22,060
The wound on his neck

503
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,060
is caused by someone

504
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,060
on purpose after he died.

505
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,060
Drowning?

506
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,060
But there is no water in this room.

507
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:36,060
You want to take it?

508
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,060
Yes.

509
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,060
Come.

510
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,060
Do you want to kill me?

511
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,060
How can your heart not be beaten

512
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,060
with someone in your heart?

513
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,060
I should die first.

514
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,060
Your heart is broken.

515
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,060
Why did you die?

516
00:27:54,060 --> 00:27:56,060
Your heart was broken.

517
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,060
Do you think my eyes

518
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,060
are broken?

519
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,060
If you die now,

520
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,060
The three-stripped firewood

521
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,580
represents his three-soul breakage.

522
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,180
When the firewood is lit,

523
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,420
there is still a demon power hidden in it.

524
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:10,300
But the three-stripped firewood can be lit.

525
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,700
It means his three-soul breakage is complete.

526
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,380
It's not the evil demon monster

527
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,180
who is the one who can suck people's soul.

528
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,460
Take the body to the Ministry of Justice for now.

529
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,780
Yes, General.

530
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,380
General, we have new findings.

531
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:39,740
The five guest

532
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,140
of the Ministry of Justice

533
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,740
are all supposed to be alive today.

534
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,020
Since you are here,

535
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:52,020
The five autopsy tests found that there were some water plants in the corpse.

536
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,020
They were from the lotus pond nearby.

537
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,020
This lotus pond was bought by Zheng Ke a few years ago.

538
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,020
It was used to close the pond.

539
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:59,020
Others couldn't even get close to it.

540
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:09,020
Ten years ago, the person who was staying at the lotus pond disappeared.

541
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,020
After that person disappeared,

542
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:15,020
the lotus in the lotus pond was opened by someone else later every year.

543
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,020
It was lost earlier than anyone else.

544
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,020
No matter how well it was opened before,

545
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:21,020
it would be lost on the 16th of June.

546
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:25,020
So you suspect that this has something to do with the lotus pond?

547
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:30,020
Let's go.

548
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,020
Where are we going?

549
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,020
The chest.

550
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:37,120
The

551
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:46,020
The object in the room was suddenly taken out.

552
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,020
Even Zheng Ke's jade pendant was broken.

553
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,020
How did you know?

554
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,020
I saw it with my eyes.

555
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,020
Are we here to kill the monster?

556
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,020
I'm here to kill the monster.

557
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:04,020
The monster's life is as beautiful as a jade pendant.

558
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:11,020
Enough.

559
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,020
This is a good medicine.

560
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:13,020
It's not a monster for the evil.

561
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:15,020
We don't need the monster's talisman.

562
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,020
Then why are we here today?

563
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,020
To wait.

564
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,020
Wait?

565
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:31,580
The

566
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,020
You are Lotus Sutra?

567
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,020
Yes.

568
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,020
Zheng Ke was killed by you?

569
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,020
Yes.

570
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,020
I was only avenging him for my gratitude.

571
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,020
Why did you kill him for your gratitude?

572
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:14,020
Ten years ago, I was born in the lotus pond.

573
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,020
The pond was dry.

574
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,020
Thanks to a young master,

575
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:21,020
a chess player who lived in my pond,

576
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,020
he would exchange the pieces for me every day.

577
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,020
I was spared from the trouble.

578
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,020
However, that night,

579
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:29,020
the company accidentally got a dragon ball crystal bottle.

580
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,020
Zheng Ke wanted to get the bottle.

581
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:34,020
He killed it by accident.

582
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:39,020
He was buried in the pond with water in the morning.

583
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,020
He tried to bury the truth.

584
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:43,020
You are a monster.

585
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,020
You should have the power.

586
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:46,020
Why didn't you save him?

587
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,020
He is my benefactor.

588
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,020
How could I not want to save him?

589
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,020
I was too poor at that time.

590
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,020
I had no power.

591
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,020
Three years ago, I escaped from the Heaven Realm

592
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,020
and forced myself to cultivate my body.

593
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,020
I was afraid that the talisman of Wuzhou

594
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,020
would not work.

595
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:04,020
So, you deliberately let the lotus in the pond

596
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,020
to die every June 16th.

597
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:09,020
The corpse is buried in the pond without anyone knowing.

598
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,020
The benefactor must be hard to see.

599
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:14,020
I wanted to make people find the ancient coffin in the pond.

600
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:16,020
So that the body of the benefactor could be rebuilt.

601
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:20,020
But no one understood it.

602
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,020
Your benefactor is not a rich person.

603
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,020
Why would he have such a precious thing?

604
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,020
The water bottle in the Dragon Palace

605
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,020
was found by the benefactor

606
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,020
in secret for my own good.

607
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:36,020
I didn't want to make Zheng Ke greedy

608
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:39,020
and bring trouble to the benefactor.

609
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:42,020
Do you know why the Wuzhou in Zheng Ke's room

610
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:46,020
and his jade pendant were destroyed suddenly?

611
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,020
I don't know.

612
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:52,020
Then, someone must have done it on purpose.

613
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,020
Lotus King,

614
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,020
everything has its causes and effects.

615
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,020
The destiny has been decided.

616
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:00,020
How can you change it?

617
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,020
Zheng Ke is guilty,

618
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,020
but he is still punished by the Ministry of Justice.

619
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:08,020
Killing him is a disorder.

620
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:10,020
Today, I'll take your internal order.

621
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,020
After you become your body,

622
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:14,020
please behave yourself

623
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:16,020
and leave Wuzhang Valley.

624
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:18,020
Leave Wuzhang Valley

625
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,020
and cultivate the Du Xian Castle.

626
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,020
Why are you still standing?

627
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,020
Hand over the internal order and leave.

628
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:48,020
The End

629
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:14,020
Young Master.

630
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,020
How is your health?

631
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,020
How is Young Master's health?

632
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,020
It's fine.

633
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,020
I'll continue to treat Young Master.

634
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,020
Young Master's illness will be cured soon.

635
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,020
It's really annoying.

636
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,020
Go to hell.

637
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:19,020
Sister Chen Jian, save me!

638
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,020
Where do you want to go?

639
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,020
You hurt the child and took the soul back.

640
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:52,020
You've hurt dozens of people.

641
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:54,020
Today, you're in my hands.

642
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,020
You deserve it.

643
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,020
You?

644
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,020
You're just a demon-catching master.

645
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:02,020
You want to stop me?

646
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:04,020
You're a single-minded person.

647
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,020
Go to hell.

648
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:36,020
You've been through a lot.

649
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,020
Don't blame me for this.

650
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:49,020
Please spare my life.

651
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:51,020
If you can spare me,

652
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:54,020
I can agree to any condition you want.

653
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:57,020
I haven't mentioned any condition.

654
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,020
You agreed so quickly.

655
00:36:59,020 --> 00:37:01,020
I've been too much.

656
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,020
Please forgive me.

657
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,020
I want your internal order.

658
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,020
You mustn't do that.

659
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,020
You don't know that

660
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:15,020
this internal order is not good for us.

661
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,020
It's a treasure for us.

662
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,020
It's a training certificate.

663
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,020
It's very hard to train.

664
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:23,020
If we give up the internal order,

665
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:25,020
all the cultivation will disappear.

666
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:27,020
Internal order or fate,

667
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,020
you choose.

668
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,020
Remember,

669
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,020
never do it again.

670
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,020
Thank you for saving my life.

671
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:20,020
You don't know me?

672
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,020
I met you the other day.

673
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,020
I didn't even know your name.

674
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,020
How could I know you?

675
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,020
It's okay. I mistook you.

676
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,020
Why did you come to the wilderness alone?

677
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,020
I'm Wu Zhangguo,

678
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,020
the biggest bookkeeper of the pharmacy.

679
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:53,020
The pharmacy's boss?

680
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,020
What bookkeeper?

681
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,020
You don't know that

682
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,020
my son is a student of Qingcheng Academy.

683
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,020
He quit school

684
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,020
under the advice of a classmate.

685
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,020
He developed his own pharmacy

686
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,020
and taught me that theory.

687
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,020
He told me to do what I like.

688
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,020
I wanted to record the characteristics of flowers and plants,

689
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,020
but I didn't expect to be so confused.

690
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,020
You're a good student.

691
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,020
I didn't expect you to be so careful.

692
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,020
What are you talking about?

693
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,020
Nothing.

694
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:31,020
Didn't you say your son was in Qingcheng Academy?

695
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,020
Then the student who was sleeping with him is...

696
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,020
The son of the Prime Minister, Kunlun Jun.

697
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,020
Kunlun Jun?

698
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:41,020
Do you know him?

699
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,020
No.

700
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,020
Listen,

701
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,020
it's dangerous to have monsters outside the city.

702
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,020
If you're okay,

703
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,020
go back home early.

704
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:55,020
I'm going back now.

705
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,020
Everyone seems to be suspicious of the monsters outside the city.

706
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,020
I don't care.

707
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:01,020
If they ask me again,

708
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:03,020
I'll be laughed at by them again.

709
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,020
It's okay.

710
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,020
If they ask you again,

711
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:09,020
just say that a sister saved you.

712
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:11,020
Fairy, can you tell me

713
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,020
your name?

714
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,020
Mu Xian.

715
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,020
The cases of monsters in the city

716
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,020
are getting more frequent.

717
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,020
Yes, there are four seasons this month.

718
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:31,020
Have you found any similarities

719
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,020
between the two seasons?

720
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:35,020
I don't think

721
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:37,020
there are any similarities.

722
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,020
You're so uneducated.

723
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:45,020
First, read it.

724
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:49,020
First,

725
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,020
the dead are the famous bad guys in the city.

726
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,020
They're a little bit of a thief.

727
00:40:53,020 --> 00:40:55,020
They can't get into the mountain,

728
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:57,020
but they're killed by the Tang's army.

729
00:40:57,020 --> 00:40:59,020
Second,

730
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:11,700
the

731
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:15,020
Third,

732
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,020
the

733
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,020
fourth,

734
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,020
the

735
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,020
fourth,

736
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,020
the

737
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:27,020
fourth,

738
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:29,020
the

739
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,020
fifth,

740
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,020
the

741
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,020
sixth,

742
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,020
the

743
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,020
seventh,

744
00:41:39,020 --> 00:41:41,020
the

745
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,020
eighth,

746
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:45,020
the

747
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,020
ninth,

748
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,020
the

749
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,020
ten,

750
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:53,020
the

751
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:55,020
ten,

752
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,020
the

753
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:59,020
fifteen,

754
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,020
the

755
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,020
86,

756
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,020
and

757
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,020
the

758
00:42:52,020 --> 00:43:12,900
Do not forget this life is the heart cut off

759
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,900
I will meet you again

760
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,900
Please change your name for a lifetime

761
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:25,900
I still remember that day

762
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,900
Happy happy

763
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:35,900
At the beginning of the flower, the eyes in my heart

764
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:41,900
I will accompany you to the end of the world to watch the wind and rain

765
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:48,900
Please change your name for a lifetime

766
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,900
I still remember that day

767
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:54,900
Happy happy

768
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:01,900
At the beginning of the flower, the eyes in my heart

769
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:07,900
I will accompany you to the end of the world to watch the wind and rain

770
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:14,900
I wish to chase you with all my heart

771
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:20,900
Can you hear the sound of the dream in your heart?

772
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:27,900
Even if time is merciless, it does not fail to forget

773
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:33,900
I want to spend my life with you
