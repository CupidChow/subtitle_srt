1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,880
is torn by memories.

2
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,160
A red interpreted sword

3
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,200
for when one can't send facility

4
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,440
to Growshian Gate

5
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:30,640
For you, I'll follow my life

6
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,640
Lest you get drunk

7
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,640
In the painting

8
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,640
Only wait for the flowers to bloom and the trees to return

9
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:00,440
Master, the monsters in the dungeon are getting more and more excited

10
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,440
I'm worried that they are getting more and more excited

11
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,440
Is it because they have some strange power?

12
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,440
Don't worry, I will put on the barrier

13
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,440
Tell the disciples to go get the meat

14
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,440
Yes

15
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,440
Is there any news from A Jiu?

16
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,440
Lu Jiu sent a message to the音符

17
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,440
Tell Master not to worry

18
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,440
He's on his way back

19
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,440
I'll be back soon

20
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,440
Okay

21
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,440
Ning Meng Jing, where did you find so many beautiful flowers?

22
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,440
Beautiful?

23
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,440
I found them under the mountain

24
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,440
I'll make it for you when I'm married

25
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,440
I've never seen anyone make this, what's the use?

26
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,440
It's a blessing

27
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,440
You don't understand

28
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,440
Ning Meng Jing

29
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,440
Thank you for your company

30
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,440
I'm very grateful

31
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,440
Okay

32
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,440
Let me ask you

33
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:09,440
Do you think I'm better or Jiao Bo is better?

34
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,440
Both

35
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,440
You said both when you were holding my flowers

36
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,440
Okay, okay, you're better

37
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,440
Okay, okay, you're better, okay?

38
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
This?

39
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,440
I've been thinking about a lot of things lately

40
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,440
I also remember the sleeping story you told me

41
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,440
That one? The river security?

42
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,440
I remember every word you told me

43
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,440
No, no, I can't cry, I'm too happy

44
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,440
I have to tell Jiao Bo

45
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,440
Your little red tea has finally recovered its memory

46
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,440
I want to let him see your wedding first

47
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,440
Slow down

48
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,440
Hong Ning

49
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,440
I'll be right back

50
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,440
I'm coming

51
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,440
Dad, mom

52
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,440
Hong Ning

53
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,440
I'm coming

54
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,440
Fatty

55
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,440
Fatty, why are you here?

56
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,440
To see my lost daughter-in-law

57
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:31,440
The director of the Cang Wu hospital sent someone to invite us here

58
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,440
He said he wanted to marry you

59
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,440
Hong Ning, Fatty said it on the way here

60
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,440
That's why he's getting married and he's getting all the money

61
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,440
Yes, yes, yes

62
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,440
Dad, mom

63
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,440
You won't blame me for not telling you about such a big thing, right?

64
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:49,440
Silly girl, your mom just wants to know if you're doing well

65
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,440
Does your future son-in-law love you?

66
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,440
Don't worry about the rest

67
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,440
Yes, you're so lucky

68
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,440
Hong Ning, you're in a special situation

69
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,440
I could have just ordered the date when I got the birthday card

70
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,440
But your master's card was not counted by the fortune teller

71
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,440
Even three of them were like this

72
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,440
I can't order the date

73
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
Not counted?

74
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
Yes, not counted

75
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,440
Yes, they said the fortune teller would steal the heaven's gift and cut their life

76
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,440
What's your master's background?

77
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,440
Hong Ning

78
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,440
Jingxiu, sit down, don't be shy

79
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
Uncle, aunt, I brought the wedding dress

80
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,440
See, this is my daughter-in-law

81
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,440
This is all silk

82
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,440
Mom, this is so beautiful

83
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,440
How much does it cost?

84
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,440
We can't pay for it

85
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,440
You know nothing

86
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,440
This is the love of our son-in-law

87
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,440
Besides, we deserve it

88
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,440
We can't waste it

89
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,440
Hong Ning, do you like it?

90
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:06,440
So beautiful

91
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,440
So beautiful

92
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,440
I like everything you give me

93
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,440
It's good that you like it

94
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,440
I've been preparing for a long time

95
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,440
By the way, master

96
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,440
Your fortune teller can't figure out your horoscope

97
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,440
You should make a date

98
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,440
How about July 7th?

99
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,440
July 7th is a good date

100
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,440
I'll listen to master

101
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,440
Good day

102
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,440
Good day

103
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,440
Good day

104
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,440
Good

105
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,440
This is for you

106
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
Move a little bit

107
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,440
I'll move over there

108
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,440
I'll move over there

109
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,440
So beautiful

110
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,440
This name is so interesting

111
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,440
Little fox, if you're here

112
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:33,440
It's burning

113
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,440
I'm sorry

114
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,440
Enough, it's a happy day

115
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,440
What are you two doing?

116
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,440
Yes, master

117
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,440
Master, look at her

118
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
She's so beautiful

119
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,440
Her father

120
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,440
You're here and there

121
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,440
You can't help me

122
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,440
What can I do?

123
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,440
The girl is going to get married

124
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,440
I can't be happy

125
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,440
Look at what you said

126
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,440
What do you want me to say?

127
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,440
Even if she's a fairy

128
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:23,440
I can't bear to part with her

129
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,440
You're so good

130
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,440
I'm not a fairy

131
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,440
I'm a fairy

132
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
I can't bear to part with her

133
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,440
Look at you

134
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,440
You're so cute

135
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,440
Don't touch me

136
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,440
I'm just curious

137
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
No, you've been touching me for a long time

138
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,440
You've been turning me around

139
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,440
You're going to touch my skin

140
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,440
You touched my skin

141
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,440
Hongning

142
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,440
So you and the fruit and the little animals

143
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,440
Are telling the truth

144
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,440
It's true

145
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
I told you when I was a kid

146
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,440
You didn't believe me

147
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,440
So, are they all monsters?

148
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,440
Then, are there many monsters in our village?

149
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,440
Yes

150
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,440
Our big black dog is also a monster

151
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,440
Our big black dog also told you

152
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:34,440
Your big black dog is not a monster

153
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,440
He's a fairy

154
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
Then, Hongning

155
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:44,440
Can you give me some blessings when I leave?

156
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,440
Okay

157
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,440
I'll give you some blessings to keep you safe

158
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,440
But you can't bully them

159
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,440
They're all good

160
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
They won't hurt you

161
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,440
You're still thinking about the black snake?

162
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,440
No

163
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,440
Why didn't he even say hello to me when he left?

164
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,440
I've been taking care of him for so long

165
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,440
He should have said hello to me

166
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,440
He's been living in the bottom of the cliff for a long time

167
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
He's so nervous

168
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,440
Don't argue with him

169
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,440
You're so smart

170
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
You're so delicate

171
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
You're so gentle

172
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:23,440
You're so kind

173
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,440
You're so kind

174
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,440
You're so kind

175
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,440
You're so kind

176
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,440
You're so kind

177
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,440
Is he still unwilling to attend my wedding?

178
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,440
I didn't think he was so gentle before

179
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,440
I told him to come and help me earlier

180
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,440
He said it was a sacred place

181
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
It's not suitable for long-term use

182
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,440
He was so quiet

183
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,440
I persuaded him after a long time

184
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
He should be on his way

185
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
Master

186
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,440
What do you want?

187
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
Hongning's soul-suppressing sub-sacrifice is inside

188
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,440
I've brought some gifts

189
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,440
Gifts?

190
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
You can't go

191
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,440
Why not?

192
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,440
You're a man

193
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,440
How can you go?

194
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,440
I'll be right back

195
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,440
I'll be right back

196
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,440
I'll be right back

197
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,440
I'll be right back

198
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Where should I go?

199
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,440
I'll be right back

200
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:22,440
I'll be right back

201
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
I'll be right back

202
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
I'll be right back

203
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,440
I'll be right back

204
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
I'll be right back

205
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,440
How can you go?

206
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,840
Are we still a couple?

207
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,640
Yeah.

208
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,440
Give it to me.

209
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,040
No.

210
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
I have to go.

211
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
I'm her best friend.

212
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,440
Give it to me.

213
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:42,840
Go back to sleep.

214
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,440
Go.

215
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,700
The

216
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,840
Is it a little small?

217
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
Or I've been getting fat recently.

218
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,240
Does it look good on me?

219
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,040
Try it.

220
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,640
Master.

221
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,440
Are you still the red tea monster I first met?

222
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,440
Why can't you say it?

223
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,440
Then I'll try it.

224
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,040
Does it look good?

225
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,440
Her feet are also shining

226
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,440
Can I be your goddess?

227
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,440
I like you is

228
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,440
Want to see you every moment

229
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:12,440
I'm happy to see you

230
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,440
Want to be with you forever

231
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,440
I'm not only grateful to the god

232
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,440
Also produced love

233
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
You said at the flower exhibition

234
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,440
As long as I'm a little bit ashamed

235
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,440
You will marry me as a goddess

236
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,440
Don't forget

237
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,440
I've forgotten

238
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,440
The flower has not changed

239
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:33,440
Don't look for me

240
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,440
Is it not good-looking?

241
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,440
I miss you

242
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
Eat a moment

243
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,440
Eat a moment

244
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,440
I also think it's a little better

245
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
I'm a little bit ashamed

246
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,440
Good-looking

247
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,440
It's better to be beautiful

248
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,440
The four seasons are too long

249
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:00,440
There is still a chance to stay

250
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,440
Looking at the old people coming and going

251
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,440
Not afraid of the wind and frost

252
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:13,440
Bring back the old days

253
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,440
God

254
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,440
Have you thought about it?

255
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,440
I am a person

256
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,440
Marry me

257
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,440
What should the emperor do after the emperor?

258
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,440
Don't worry

259
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:41,440
I will find a way to solve it

260
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
Really?

261
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,440
I will definitely persuade them

262
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
What's wrong?

263
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
I just think

264
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
This is not true

265
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,440
In the last life

266
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,440
I tried hard to become your life

267
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,440
Is this life really so simple?

268
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,440
This life will not

269
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,440
I will always be by your side

270
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,440
Never lose you again

271
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,440
The flower has not changed

272
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,440
Don't look for me

273
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,440
Looking at the old people coming and going

274
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:37,440
But I miss you

275
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
Eat a moment

276
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,440
Eat a moment

277
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,440
Fox brother

278
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
When did you come back?

279
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,440
You and the little fox master still say you

280
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,440
When did you start to care about me?

281
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,440
I just want to ask

282
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,440
How about the little fox?

283
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,440
He should be fine

284
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,440
After all he is home

285
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,440
There are his family

286
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
Have his friends

287
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Yes

288
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,440
He should not be afraid

289
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,440
So little

290
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,440
Although he is a fairy

291
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,440
But he is a little poor

292
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
A good sheep and cow can't be taken out

293
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,440
Yes

294
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
When I married you

295
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
I had two ducks

296
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
Yes

297
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:54,440
The Cangwu Academy looks very good

298
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,440
Stop

299
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,440
Is this our master?

300
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,440
I'm not sure now

301
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
So what?

302
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,440
This person is in love

303
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,440
The brain is really broken

304
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,440
That's too scary

305
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,440
I really want to know why the master

306
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,440
What did you do?

307
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,440
The master seems to have done everything he should do

308
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,440
What is the master doing?

309
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
I do not know

310
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
Fang Zeyou

311
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,440
You say that mortals marry

312
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,440
Not giving silk, but giving ducks

313
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,440
Master, let me help you

314
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,440
Another silly one

315
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
If my little fox is here

316
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,440
I can play with him

317
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,440
The third one

318
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,440
The fourth one

319
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,440
A Jiu is not willing to go with me

320
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,440
Visiting the northern border

321
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,440
I only have you

322
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,440
Go over there

323
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:42,440
Where are you going?

324
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,440
No, you can't go alone

325
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
It's too dangerous

326
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
They have Zhanshan Order

327
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,440
Go

328
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,440
Go

329
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,440
Go

330
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
The northern border is in a hurry

331
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,440
Go

332
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,440
I

333
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
I go down

334
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,440
The heavenly maiden should not have gone far

335
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,440
Chase

336
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
I go

337
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,440
No meaning

338
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,440
Why did they lock me here?

339
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,440
Learn to dance, learn embroidery

340
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,440
Why are they telling me

341
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

342
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

343
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

344
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

345
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

346
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

347
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

348
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

349
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

350
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

351
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

352
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

353
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

354
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

355
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

356
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

357
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

358
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

359
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

360
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

361
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

362
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

363
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,440
I don't understand the responsibilities and obligations

364
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
Let's go

365
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,440
Let's go

366
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,440
The reservation is over

367
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,440
Let's go

368
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,440
The reservation is over

369
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
Are you asking me something now?

370
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,440
You are irasfearing

371
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Are you asking me something now?

372
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,440
I'm great

373
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,440
You are really great

374
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,440
You are really great

375
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,440
You are really great

376
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,440
You are really great

377
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,440
You are really great

378
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,440
You are really great

379
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,440
You are really great

00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
You are really great

381
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,440
You are really great

382
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,440
I should go

383
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,440
I should go

384
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,440
But your thoughts arrived, denominated

385
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,440
I'm sorry

386
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,440
Sorry

387
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
Sorry

388
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
Sorry

389
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,440
Enjoy the sea

390
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,440
Enjoy the sea

391
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:05,040
You are my first friend. What's your name?

392
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,840
Can't you speak?

393
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,040
You look like a mirror.

394
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,240
You are a wonderful mirror.

395
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,040
Then you can be called Magic Mirror.

396
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,040
Great! I have a friend!

397
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,840
I have a friend!

398
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,440
I have a friend!

399
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,640
Feng Xi!

400
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:18,840
Feng Xi!

401
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,640
I will take you home.

402
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,240
You are my first friend.

403
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,040
My only friend.

404
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,040
My best friend.

405
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,840
Feng Xi!

406
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,440
Feng Xi!

407
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,840
Feng Xi!

408
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,140
Feng Xi!

409
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,040
Feng Xi!

410
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,240
You are really going to marry him tomorrow?

411
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,040
Why do you still believe that

412
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,880
If you were a woman, you should have made a promise.

413
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,400
Are you stupid to coax you?

414
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,280
You are a demon.

415
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,360
She spent dozens of years looking for you.

416
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,880
She must have another intention.

417
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,800
If she wanted to catch me,

418
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,240
she would have done it long ago.

419
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,440
Then you know,

420
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,600
you are very likely to be the Demon King.

421
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,800
Demon King?

422
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,680
The black snake you met in the Dragon Pool is Shanggu.

423
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:36,240
She was the wife of Demon King Fuzhu ten thousand years ago.

424
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,160
But she changed you as her master.

425
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,520
So,

426
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,480
you are very likely to be the blood of Demon King.

427
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,560
Impossible.

428
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,600
How is it impossible?

429
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,000
Do you know that when you were in Hua Zhao Palace,

430
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,600
your cultivation speed was very fast?

431
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,480
It was much easier to get through the night than the ordinary immortals.

432
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,160
I found that your power was much stronger than the ordinary people.

433
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,200
Plus, the black snake changed you into the Demon King.

434
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,600
Plus, the black snake changed you into the master.

435
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,040
I was more certain.

436
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,920
But I never heard of any Demon King.

437
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,760
I never heard of Master.

438
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,440
There are too many secrets in this world.

439
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,360
We don't know if it doesn't mean that he doesn't exist.

440
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,440
The power of Demon King can summon all the demons in the three realms.

441
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,400
He just wants to use you to gather all the demons

442
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,520
and then kill them all.

443
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,480
You are talking nonsense.

444
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,320
If Master is such a person,

445
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,880
how can the Heavens School have the chance to cultivate immortals

446
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,640
if there are so many demons in the mountain?

447
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,800
That's the demon of their immortal abode.

448
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,280
They just like to do this.

449
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,720
They like to divide the demons into three, six, and nine levels.

450
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,520
The one who has the immortal abode is the one who has the immortal abode.

451
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,400
The one who doesn't have the immortal abode should die.

452
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,160
Your Master is just an outsider like this.

453
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,720
A puppet master who is full of hands.

454
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:51,520
The battle of immortals and demons has been going on for a long time.

455
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,000
Master can't bear these alone.

456
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,280
Can you be sober?

457
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,560
I have gone through so much trouble.

458
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,640
I came back to you from the Qi Lin Cave.

459
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,520
I just want to lead all the demons to fight against the Heavens.

460
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,760
The Dragon-dome Pond is not yet established.

461
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,240
I have been trying to get the Water of the Forbidden City for you.

462
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,680
I just hope that you can remember that you were a red sand demon.

463
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,280
You were killed by the Immortals.

464
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,320
Do you know that?

465
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,320
You are blinded by hatred.

466
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,160
You have bias against all the Immortals.

467
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,120
Do you know that?

468
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,840
Why?

469
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,400
Because you are the one who killed the Immortals.

470
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,480
You are the one who is blinded by the Immortals.

471
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,080
Not me.

472
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,040
Don't you understand?

473
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,360
How much I like you.

474
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,240
You like the me you imagined.

475
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,160
Not the real me.

476
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,200
So,

477
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,440
do you really want to stand with the Immortals?

478
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,400
I don't want to stand with the Immortals.

479
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,200
I want to stand with my heart.

480
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,800
I want to get married.

481
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,040
If you bless me,

482
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,080
stay and drink with me.

483
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,960
If you don't bless me,

484
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,560
I will die.

485
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:19,920
Please.

486
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,160
Okay.

487
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,400
Okay.

488
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,360
Hongning.

489
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,960
You will pay for your choice today.

490
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,120
Here.

491
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,840
It's really you.

492
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,400
Long time no see.

493
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,800
How are you recently?

494
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:25,080
Are you here to attend

495
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,080
Hong Ning's wedding?

496
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,640
I'm leaving.

497
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,000
What's wrong with you?

498
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,600
You don't seem to be happy.

499
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,440
Hong Ning and Jin Xiu

500
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,160
shouldn't be together.

501
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,840
Why?

502
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,480
Why not?

503
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,240
I think they are a good match.

504
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:53,880
One is the god of heaven,

505
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,280
the future emperor.

506
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,120
And the other is the pride of our Baizhou Mountain.

507
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,960
I think they are a good match.

508
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,360
How can they be together?

509
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,000
Why not?

510
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,920
Love can break all the customs.

511
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:08,840
And they have gone through so much

512
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,760
and finally get together.

513
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,040
We should bless them.

514
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,280
Besides,

515
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,840
Jin Xiu is so powerful.

516
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,120
He can handle everything.

517
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,040
With his ability,

518
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,320
you and I...

519
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,120
You can't even imagine a demon

520
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,400
who can't even repair a fairy.

521
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,600
What's wrong with you?

522
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,720
Master,

523
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,560
I found this when I was searching the mountain.

524
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:52,720
Do you want to go there when you find it?

525
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,240
Don't tell anyone.

526
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,120
Yes.

527
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,840
Master.

528
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,600
Hong Ning,

529
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,320
they said we can't meet before the wedding.

530
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,120
Go back.

531
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,960
But I have something to ask you.

532
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:24,960
What?

533
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,160
Do you know about the Demon King?

534
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,440
Why do you ask me?

535
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,080
I don't know.

536
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,480
I just want to know.

537
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,840
I just want to know.

538
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,080
But I don't know.

539
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,480
I just want to know.

540
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,640
I just want to know.

541
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,720
I just want to know.

542
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,760
I just want to know.

543
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,800
I just want to know.

544
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:46,000
I just want to know.

545
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,880
Am I the Demon King?

546
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,720
Of course not.

547
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,720
Really?

548
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,960
Yes.

549
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,720
I'm relieved.

550
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:06,880
Master.

551
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
See you tomorrow.

552
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:23,760
lifestyle

553
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,360
Master

554
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,360
I'm leaving.

555
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,440
Master,

556
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,800
all the disciples are gathered here.

557
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,120
Okay.

558
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,080
Today is my wedding day.

559
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,560
Many people will come to have a wedding.

560
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,280
And many friends from Mount Baizhou.

561
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,960
Remember, don't be rude.

562
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,120
Me?

563
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,200
Master,

564
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,560
you can live.

565
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:11,320
When they come,

566
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,040
I'll treat them well.

567
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,920
In order to avoid trouble,

568
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,240
we must check all the invitation cards.

569
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,040
The seal of my Cangwu Academy

570
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,080
can be entered.

571
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,680
And all the roads

572
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,560
must be strictly blocked.

573
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:24,800
Yes.

574
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,240
Come on.

575
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,760
Everyone, go up.

576
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:29,880
Mom,

577
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,240
this place is great.

578
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,560
I want to practice magic.

579
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,800
I think I'm very talented.

580
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,440
Look,

581
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:35,840
how is it?

582
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,560
You're talented.

583
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,760
You can't reach the sky.

584
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,240
Go back and study hard.

585
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,560
You don't study hard all day.

586
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,840
It's the most ridiculous and strange thing.

587
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:46,640
Go.

588
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,440
Go.

589
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:49,160
Mom,

590
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,960
maybe I can reach the sky in the future.

591
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,440
Mom.

592
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,360
Here you are.

593
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,760
Master,

594
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,280
what are you writing?

595
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,560
It's the wedding day of Hongning.

596
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,000
I want to send a wedding gift.

597
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,840
I've been thinking about it.

598
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,960
Hongning

599
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,600
has never been to the exam.

600
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
So,

601
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:08,800
I wrote a

602
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,640
simple exam-testing note for her.

603
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,320
This is good.

604
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:12,800
Wait,

605
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,360
you just send this when you get married?

606
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,240
What?

607
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,360
Do you have any objection?

608
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,200
No, no.

609
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,800
I mean, I'm very considerate.

610
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,960
Of course.

611
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:22,440
Hongning is my first friend in Cangwu Mountain.

612
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,360
I just didn't expect

613
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,560
she is a girl.

614
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,720
And she married Master.

615
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,760
In this way,

616
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:36,560
Master is my brother-in-law.

617
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,080
Let me down.

618
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,160
Take it down.

619
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,200
Look, Master.

620
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,000
Amazing.

621
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,400
Look at her.

622
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,200
She is so beautiful.

623
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,440
She is so beautiful.

624
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,200
Look at her.

625
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:03,000
Come on, this way.

626
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,640
Look at her.

627
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,760
She is so beautiful.

628
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,480
She is so beautiful.

629
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,760
It's the first time I've seen Master

630
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,000
dressed so well.

631
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,720
Yeah.

632
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:15,960
Yeah.

633
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:17,440
She is so beautiful.

634
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,200
Yeah.

635
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,440
Master, turn around.

636
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,200
Let me see.

637
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,480
Master.

638
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,200
I'm so excited.

639
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,680
Master.

640
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,680
I have to do it too.

641
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,120
Let's get back to the point.

642
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,520
How are the other disciples dressed?

643
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,920
Is there anyone watching the dungeon?

644
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,680
All the decorations

645
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,040
are watched by Brother Fox.

646
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:44,720
There are also

647
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,080
the music and other little disciples

648
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:46,680
watching the dungeon.

649
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,160
Okay.

650
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,600
Then send the talisman to everyone.

651
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,600
Yes, Master.

652
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,000
Bailing.

653
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,480
How are the parents?

654
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:04,480
Who?

655
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,000
The married couple of the same age.

656
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:09,560
Who?

657
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,000
How are my parents?

658
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,080
That's right.

659
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,240
Father-in-law.

660
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:19,960
He has been

661
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,480
holding the handrail for more than ten times today.

662
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,800
He doesn't stop.

663
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,400
Look.

664
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,320
Look.

665
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,000
He's going again.

666
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,320
I guess he's too nervous.

667
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,960
Where is the mother-in-law?

668
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,960
She's still in Hongning.

669
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,480
Then Hongning...

670
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,560
Master.

671
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,680
Why are you so problematic today?

672
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,720
It's not like you.

673
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:40,720
Are you nervous too?

674
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,040
Okay.

675
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,160
Believe me.

676
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,000
With me here,

677
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,760
I will definitely make you

678
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,480
marry the bride smoothly.

679
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,280
Where are you sticking it?

680
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,800
I...

681
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,800
I'm a Saturday night watchman.

682
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,840
Okay, let's go.

683
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,560
Master.

684
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:22,000
It's my faithful

685
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,800
Bailing.

686
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,040
I'm going to propose the bride.

687
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,000
You can't show it to men now

688
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:26,920
Get out

689
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,440
It's okay

690
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,880
Just treat me as a woman

691
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,280
Come on, smile

692
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,920
Fatty

693
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,000
Is this blush a little red?

694
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,840
Not enough red

695
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,160
The more red the merrier

696
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,120
Mrs. Wu

697
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,400
Why are you crying?

698
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,320
Come and comb her hair

699
00:36:58,320 --> 00:36:59,120
Come on

700
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,400
From the beginning

701
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,520
I have no sorrow

702
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,360
From the beginning

703
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,720
I have no sorrow

704
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,400
From the beginning

705
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,640
I have no sorrow

706
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,640
From the beginning

707
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,240
I have no sorrow

708
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
Mother

709
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,400
I didn't discuss with you

710
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,160
about such a big thing

711
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,520
You really don't blame me?

712
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,200
Silly girl

713
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,200
As long as you are happy

714
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,520
I can do anything

715
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,240
I just want you to live well

716
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,640
I am already very happy

717
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,600
to have you and daddy

718
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,800
Okay, okay

719
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,640
The makeup will be ruined

720
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,400
And your lemon wine

721
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,120
Thank you for growing up with me in this life

722
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,880
You should be tolerant, Hong Ding

723
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,280
You are like a living thing

724
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,640
and a living thing

725
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,000
I tell you

726
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,400
Even if you are a living thing

727
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,280
I am the most important person in your life

728
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,400
Zhi Yi

729
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,360
Is the bride ready?

730
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,160
The auspicious time is coming

731
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,520
Okay, okay

732
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,800
Okay, it's a happy thing

733
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,840
You can't cry

734
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,120
Hurry up and smile

735
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:14,600
Where is daddy?

736
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,320
Your father

737
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,440
I don't know where he went to hide and cry

738
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,880
I'm sorry to let you see

739
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,400
I'm not angry with you

740
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:22,720
Okay, okay

741
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:23,520
The bride should go out

742
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:24,320
Yes

743
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,280
Go, go

744
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:26,120
Go

745
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,240
Go

746
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,080
You haven't worn the wedding dress

747
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,400
Wedding dress

748
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,760
Daddy

749
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,960
You forgot such an important thing

750
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,480
How can you go out?

751
00:39:45,720 --> 00:40:09,920
You

752
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,820
What is he going to do?

753
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:11,940
Maybe

754
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:12,760
must know

755
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,120
a skill

756
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:20,560
that will lead to a positioned bride

757
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,280
Please

758
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,240
No

759
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,160
Kahong

760
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,160
Thank you. Get up.

761
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,160
Qing'er.

762
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:59,160
Get up, Hongying.

763
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,160
Let's go.

764
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:20,160
Green blood, red hair, red hair.

765
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,160
Why do you need to be so lazy?

766
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,160
Don't be so lazy.

767
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:27,160
The bride is leaving the room.

768
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,160
Qing'er.

769
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,160
The spring has gone with the wind.

770
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:33,160
When will we meet again?

771
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:38,160
The white hand that holds the door.

772
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:43,160
The wind blows away the life.

773
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:46,160
The stars shine brightly.

774
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:49,160
The past is gone.

775
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,160
The clouds are left.

776
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,160
The falling flowers.

777
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,160
The time has come.

778
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:05,160
The time has come.

779
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:12,160
Please call me your name for a lifetime.

780
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:15,160
I still remember that day.

781
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,160
I am happy.

782
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:25,160
The blooming flowers are full of wishes.

783
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:31,160
I will accompany you to the end of the world to enjoy the wind and rain.

784
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:38,160
Please call me your name for a lifetime.

785
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,160
I still remember that day.

786
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,160
I am happy.

787
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:51,160
The blooming flowers are full of wishes.

788
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:57,160
I will accompany you to the end of the world to enjoy the wind and rain.

789
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:04,160
I still remember that day.

790
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:10,160
I still remember that day.

791
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,160
Even if time is endless, it will never forget.

792
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:24,160
I still remember that day.
