1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Only I am drunk

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The beauty in the painting

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
is waiting for the flowers to bloom and the trees to meet

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The Legend of Chusen

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,820
The

7
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,000
Legend of Chusen

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Episode 16

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
There is only hell nearby.

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
You can stop the bleeding first.

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I'll look for something else later.

12
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
You are familiar with these.

13
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I always get hurt.

14
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I will get hurt after a long time.

15
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Why do you get hurt often?

16
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I was wandering in the dark when I was young.

17
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
It's inevitable.

18
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Oh, right.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I remember you called me...

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I...

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You can call me A Yao.

22
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
A Yao?

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Miss Yao,

24
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
why did you leave Xu Yun Temple

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and come to our Cangwo Mountain?

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
There are bad people

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
who are taking over our family

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and are after me.

29
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I escaped.

30
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Bad people?

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Don't worry.

32
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
We are here.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
No one can hurt you.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I came here

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
to find my family.

36
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I want to take them back

37
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
and take their families back.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
So we are here

39
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
to find your family?

40
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I can help you.

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Why are you so nice to me?

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I have no family

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
or love since I was young.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't want others to experience

45
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
the pain

46
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I experienced before.

47
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You must

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
hate your family very much.

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Father, father,

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
look at my sword.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Who allowed you to call me father?

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Father.

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Listen to me.

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I can't give birth to a three-tailed fox like you.

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You have nothing to do

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
with my nine-tailed fox clan.

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Go away.

58
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I have no family.

59
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I have forgotten it.

60
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I will go to the mountain.

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
We will go to the mountain

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
when you recover.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Have a rest.

64
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I will go to find something to eat.

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Ninth brother.

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Brother Ninth.

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:36,840
Lay Xiao

68
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,880
White tea.

69
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Hou Ning.

70
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,000
Did Master conquest the wound?

71
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
It's better.

72
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,400
the little black snake that came back with you from the Dragon Pool.

73
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,440
He also took this medicine.

74
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,560
His wound healed so fast.

75
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,040
Little black snake?

76
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,280
It's strange.

77
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,720
That little black snake

78
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,840
called me master

79
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,000
when he was in the Dragon Pool.

80
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:00,880
Master said

81
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,400
it's because he was injured.

82
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,920
It's a bit unusual here.

83
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,040
He's looking for master everywhere.

84
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,360
Where is he now?

85
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,760
He's watching over at the lemon tree.

86
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,920
Hongning.

87
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,920
This black snake

88
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,000
could be a monster from Shanggu.

89
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,080
Shanggu Monster?

90
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,840
Hongning.

91
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,680
Hongning.

92
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,360
Ning Mengjian.

93
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,720
That little black snake is still awake.

94
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,320
Good.

95
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,120
Let me introduce you a friend.

96
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,080
No.

97
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,360
How can you share your friendship with others?

98
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,240
Why are you so sour?

99
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,240
His name is Bai Cha.

100
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,000
He's a good friend I met in the Dragon Pool.

101
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,200
He was injured.

102
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,280
So I brought him back to heal him.

103
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:41,880
By the way,

104
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,360
Master Shun seems to have called you.

105
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,760
Then please take care of him for me.

106
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,560
Okay.

107
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,640
Go. Go. Go.

108
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,640
Why are you here?

109
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,480
Are you Ning Meng

110
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,960
from the Baizhou Mountain?

111
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,160
I heard that

112
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,320
Master Bai Cha said you were thrown into the Qi Lin Cave.

113
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,320
How did you escape?

114
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,160
Someone helped me.

115
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,480
I escaped for a while.

116
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,320
Why are you here?

117
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,360
I'm here to protect Hongning.

118
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,240
I heard that she's in Cangwu Mountain.

119
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm worried.

120
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,880
So I came to accompany her.

121
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,960
Bai Cha.

122
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,800
I don't know why you're here.

123
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,160
But I want to tell you.

124
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,000
You've seen it.

125
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,040
Hongning has become a mortal now.

126
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,400
She has lost her previous memory.

127
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,600
She's happy now.

128
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:33,440
Don't bother her.

129
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,040
Why do you say that?

130
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,640
She doesn't remember

131
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,120
the memories she had with you in Baizhou Mountain.

132
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,520
Don't you care at all?

133
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,280
It doesn't matter.

134
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,280
As a true friend,

135
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,440
I just want her to be happy.

136
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,840
Happiness is the most important thing.

137
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,880
She did so many silly things

138
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,000
for Jingxiu in the last life.

139
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,520
Do you want to see her repeat the same mistakes

140
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,080
and continue to be with such a person?

141
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,400
I don't know what happened in Zhong Tian

142
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,520
and what she went through.

143
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,880
But Hongning has become a mortal now.

144
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,520
She's very transparent,

145
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,720
brave and optimistic now.

146
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,600
That's great.

147
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,960
And Master Bai Cha has forgotten her past.

148
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,680
If they can meet here now,

149
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,720
it's God's arrangement.

150
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,680
It's good that you listen to God's arrangement.

151
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,960
Forgotten?

152
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,080
Are you sure?

153
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,560
What do you mean?

154
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,280
The Master you mentioned

155
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,960
didn't forget her past at all.

156
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,560
She remembers everything.

157
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,080
Just now,

158
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,800
she came to intimidate me.

159
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,200
No.

160
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,000
The Heaven and Earth brothers

161
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,600
will forget everything.

162
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,680
Everyone says so.

163
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,080
Do you really think those immortals

164
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,040
and demons like us

165
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,600
follow the same rules?

166
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,040
Do you really think

167
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,360
they won't use their special powers

168
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,840
to realize their own goals?

169
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:42,840
No.

170
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,080
But Master is really...

171
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,160
That's all a lie.

172
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,720
This Jing Xiu

173
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,840
is a completely wronged gentleman.

174
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,760
He pretends to be good to everyone.

175
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,640
He lied to Hongning about his feelings.

176
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,400
He pretends to marry her to make her promise.

177
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,960
But he married the princess of the North Star Realm behind her back

178
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,440
and made her fall into the Flower Fairy Pool.

179
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,120
I came here

180
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,600
to expose her true face

181
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,080
so that you won't be fooled by her anymore.

182
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,480
Master...

183
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:08,680
Impossible.

184
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,960
You, me and Hongning

185
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,080
are both from Mount Baizhou.

186
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,760
And Hongning saved me

187
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,160
from danger because of your kindness.

188
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,840
Why should I lie to you?

189
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,800
I was humiliated and tortured

190
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,480
in the Qi Lin Cave.

191
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,880
I only found out the news

192
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,800
about the demon there.

193
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,600
It was the same person who was the judge of the case.

194
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,200
He used his power

195
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,520
and ignored the demon's death.

196
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,480
He threw the demon into the Qi Lin Cave

197
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,760
and suffered the torment of the Heaven Fire.

198
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,640
He died in a terrible way.

199
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,240
No wonder there are demons in the dungeon.

200
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,080
Even if he came to the Cangwu Mountain,

201
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,160
he would still do the same thing.

202
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,240
I came here

203
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:46,240
to protect Hongning

204
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,200
and protect you,

205
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,440
so that you won't be harmed again.

206
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,520
No. I have to go to the dungeon

207
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,360
and ask you about the demon.

208
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,560
Wait.

209
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,360
They won't give you any good evidence.

210
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,760
They are not

211
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,920
some demons who have seen the world.

212
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,840
Then how can I prove it?

213
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,800
I have some clues.

214
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,120
What did you find?

215
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,000
A double-headed snake.

216
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,560
What? What is it?

217
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,320
There was a double-headed snake in the past.

218
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,360
The two snakes had the same head.

219
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,920
One was a black snake snake.

220
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,600
The other was a green snake snake.

221
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,800
It was in the bottom of the Heaven.

222
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,600
It crossed the Lianhua Pass

223
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,480
and was loyal to the demon.

224
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,200
It was the same snake snake

225
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,600
that was in the bottom of the Heaven.

226
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,200
It was the same snake snake

227
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,600
that was in the bottom of the Heaven.

228
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,640
Until the demon king was captured,

229
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,240
it fought for seven days and seven nights

230
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,560
to protect its master and the heavenly soldiers.

231
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,800
It was only cut into two pieces

232
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,720
by a divine power.

233
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,600
It became two hands.

234
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,160
One fell into the Qilin Cave.

235
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,440
The other one

236
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,520
disappeared.

237
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,440
Does this have anything to do with you?

238
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,560
I don't know.

239
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,000
I just read it here.

240
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,760
Demon king.

241
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,560
I'm afraid anyone who wanted to do this

242
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,360
wanted toipes into your grasp.

243
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,440
No, one of us should be trapped

244
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,760
until we find the drain.

245
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,960
Don't be afraid of being angered by departure.

246
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:29,040
Or else, you may not

247
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,960
be able to rem Kayla up in vigor.

248
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,360
Those beasts

249
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,280
are like wife 571,

250
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,160
but they didn't arrows

251
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Ah?

252
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
This way.

253
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,080
This is the best place for our Cangwu disciples to practice.

254
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,400
You are really considerate.

255
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,680
Has the black snake been awake all the time?

256
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,800
Master has already talked about it.

257
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,200
It shouldn't be long before it wakes up.

258
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,440
We can make it more powerful yes matter how strong I am,

259
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,960
it's still more Said An ability will be combined with both pros and cons

260
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,400
That's right

261
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,120
Definitely

262
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,160
He wants to change Hong Ning to his master.

263
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,560
Then Hong Ning is the Demon King

264
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,760
that Qilin Dongli Qingshe said.

265
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,920
No.

266
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,600
She can't be the Demon King.

267
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,040
She must leave with me.

268
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07,920
We can't find her anymore.

269
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
If we keep looking for her,

270
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,760
she will be taken into the wild.

271
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,480
There must be a reason for the human being to propose.

272
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,080
How did Duan Fei propose?

273
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,520
Why can't I remember?

274
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
The mountains are falling, the rivers are flowing.

275
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,920
My heart is moved by your company day and night.

276
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,040
What is this?

277
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,520
The first time parents meet.

278
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,920
The choice of meeting place.

279
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,320
The attention of parents meeting.

280
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,920
The meeting of parents...

281
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,320
That's not right.

282
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,920
The first time parents meet.

283
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,320
The choice of meeting place.

284
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,920
The attention of parents meeting.

285
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,320
The meeting of parents...

286
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,320
送.

287
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,920
That's not right.

288
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,920
Flowers bloom and wither.

289
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,920
You...

290
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,920
Propose to marry three times.

291
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,920
Meet you, like you, like you, want to chase you.

292
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,520
Date you, test you, please you,

293
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
flatter you, miss you,

294
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,520
hope you, confess to you, follow you.

295
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,120
Crying and begging you, crazy you,

296
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,920
you are all you, want to marry you.

297
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,920
She should know what I said.

298
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,920
She means to propose, right?

299
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,920
If she remembers the past,

300
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
and doesn't agree,

301
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,920
what should I do?

302
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,920
Master.

303
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,520
Coming.

304
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,920
Master, are you looking for me?

305
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,520
You are looking for me?

306
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
I...

307
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,320
Am I looking for you?

308
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,720
No.

309
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,320
I'm looking for you.

310
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:16,920
Then...

311
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,920
Do you have anything to tell me?

312
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,720
How do you know I have something to tell you?

313
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,520
You tell me. I can accept it.

314
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,520
Really?

315
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:28,520
Does she know I'm going to propose to her?

316
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,320
Tell me.

317
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,520
About the red tea.

318
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,120
Eat more.

319
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
I ate it.

320
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,520
Do you like the red tea?

321
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,120
Yes.

322
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,920
Should I say no?

323
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:26,320
The world is full of good and bad.

324
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,720
Who doesn't want to drink the red tea?

325
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,520
Drink the red tea.

326
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,120
Does she not understand what I mean?

327
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,720
What is she trying to say?

328
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
Eat.

329
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,920
This...

330
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,320
is as beautiful as the red tea.

331
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,720
Carrots are good for your health.

332
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,120
You can eat more.

333
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,720
This...

334
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,720
is more beautiful than the red tea.

335
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,920
Tomatoes are good for your health.

336
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,120
If you like it,

337
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,520
I'll let them make more.

338
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,920
I know.

339
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,720
Your Highness.

340
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:01,120
I know that...

341
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,720
Master is very nice to me.

342
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,720
I also trust him.

343
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,520
But the red tea flower from the previous life...

344
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,320
to him...

345
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,320
what is it?

346
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,520
Can I ask him?

347
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,920
Little Sister.

348
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,120
You're here to give the red tea to Heavenly Maid again?

349
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,120
I'm here to give the red tea to Heavenly Maid.

350
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,120
I'm here to give the red tea to Heavenly Maid.

351
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,720
You're here to give the red tea to Heavenly Maid again?

352
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,720
Is it because of Fox Girl?

353
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,720
Little Sister also thinks that she looks like Heavenly Maid?

354
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,320
I asked Master...

355
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,120
who Fox Girl is.

356
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,520
Master told me that...

357
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,720
when I become a fairy,

358
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,320
I'll know the answer.

359
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,920
So I guess...

360
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,320
that little fox...

361
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,320
is Heavenly Maid.

362
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,920
What are you going to do?

363
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,720
Of course, I'll become a fairy.

364
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,920
And she's protecting Brother Fox so much.

365
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,920
Their relationship must be very close.

366
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,320
When Brother Fox comes back,

367
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,120
I must ask her.

368
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,520
Maybe they're still close.

369
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,920
This should be the direction to the Northern Fairy Realm.

370
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,520
Did you finally find your brother?

371
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,320
He's very close to me.

372
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,520
Sometimes,

373
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,320
I feel that he's very far away.

374
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,720
It must be hard for you.

375
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,720
It's not hard.

376
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,720
It's just that I don't like...

377
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,720
to enter the Northern Fairy Realm.

378
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,120
But since I promised you,

379
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,720
I'll escort you back.

380
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,120
The Northern Fairy Realm?

381
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,520
I'll kill you!

382
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:25,720
No!

383
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,520
No!

384
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,120
Three Sisters' Fire.

385
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,820
Nine-tailed Fox.

386
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,520
You're Heavenly Maid Lu Yao?

387
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,120
Jiu, this place isn't safe.

388
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:52,920
Let's go.

389
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,080
The wild Deity of Tian Hu

390
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,400
took over the throne

391
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,080
and put Father in the palace of the Northern Immortal Realm.

392
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,920
I ran away from there after I was dead.

393
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,480
Now I only have you as my family.

394
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,360
Please go back with me.

395
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,120
The Northern Immortal Realm needs you.

396
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,720
I'm just a fox with three tails.

397
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,240
I was locked up by Father since I was born.

398
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,000
The Northern Immortal Realm

399
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,400
never needed me.

400
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,080
When did I

401
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,280
have an older sister who never showed up?

402
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,040
Go back with me

403
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,160
and take the Northern Immortal Realm back.

404
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,520
I'll give you justice.

405
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,240
Your Highness,

406
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,920
since I was a child,

407
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,040
I've been treated as a person

408
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,440
of the Northern Immortal Realm for a day.

409
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,440
Your high-ranking father

410
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,880
ordered me to be pushed into the Qilin Cave.

411
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,000
I'm the shame of the Northern Immortal Realm

412
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,280
and the sinner of the Northern Immortal Realm.

413
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,880
Now you want me to go back?

414
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:45,920
Where?

415
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,600
We're sorry for you.

416
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,560
From now on,

417
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,640
I'll make it up to you.

418
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,240
I'm not your sister.

419
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,800
From now on,

420
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,560
don't show up in front of me.

421
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,040
Or I'll skin you

422
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,080
and cut your bones.

423
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,840
Heavenly Maid, why are you practicing swordsmanship again?

424
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,000
Didn't His Majesty

425
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,280
order you to practice

426
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,680
the embroidery skill more recently?

427
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,800
But I don't like embroidery.

428
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,120
Did Father agree to let me go to see my brother?

429
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,960
My little ancestor,

430
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,320
don't mention him again.

431
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,800
When the Northern Immortal Realm King heard his name,

432
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,840
he got angry.

433
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,160
You'll make us

434
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,200
suffer the same fate.

435
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,320
Why?

436
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,280
He's my brother.

437
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:16,840
Why can't I go to see him?

438
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,840
Because he's the son of the noble Jiuwei Hu,

439
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,960
the Northern Immortal King.

440
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,280
He was born with three tails.

441
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,640
It's his fault.

442
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,040
His appearance

443
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,120
is the biggest shame

444
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
of the proud Northern King.

445
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,240
You must remember

446
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,640
to forget about your brother.

447
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,800
Heavenly Maid, you must be strong.

448
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,000
You're the last hope

449
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,240
of the Northern Immortal Realm.

450
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,280
Teacher, do you need anything from me?

451
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,920
Iские

452
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,440
haven't finished

453
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:58,960
what I had to say to you.

454
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,640
Teacher,

455
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,340
what do you want to say?

456
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,680
I want to tell you

457
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,160
about things that happened in your earlier life.

458
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,320
We had an Daman S registre

459
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,360
for the uses of amazon

460
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,080
in your last life.

461
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:23,280
I've been thinking about it for a while.

462
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,280
Because I wanted you to practice,

463
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:29,280
so you ended up falling into the flowery world and suffering.

464
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:35,280
I didn't want to tell you this,

465
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,280
but after the dragon ball,

466
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:39,280
I saw my true self.

467
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,280
After thinking about it,

468
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,280
I don't want to ignore my feelings anymore.

469
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:49,280
I don't want to escape those painful memories.

470
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:56,280
You always ask me if I'm the immortal you saw when you were little.

471
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,280
I never dared to admit it.

472
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,280
Because I'm afraid

473
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,280
you'll remember the past

474
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,280
and bring you pain again.

475
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:09,280
But what I'm more afraid of is

476
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,280
your rejection of me,

477
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,280
your hatred for me.

478
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,280
Now this question

479
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,280
is revealed to you.

480
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,280
If you want to remember the past,

481
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,280
I'll help you.

482
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,280
But if you don't want to,

483
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,280
I won't force you.

484
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,280
Master,

485
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,280
I just want to ask you one thing.

486
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,280
At the Dragon Hall,

487
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:45,280
the one who can make you happy

488
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:47,280
is me in the past.

489
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,280
Yes.

490
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:54,280
So I'm the red teapot in your last life?

491
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,280
Yes.

492
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,280
Do you want to remember the past?

493
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,280
I...

494
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,280
I want to think about it again.

495
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,280
No hurry.

496
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,280
I'll wait for you.

497
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:51,280
Hong Ning.

498
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,280
White tea.

499
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,280
This is the medicine I found from the back hill.

500
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,280
It's very good for your energy.

501
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,280
Try it.

502
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,280
Oh, Lemon King.

503
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,280
Bring a bowl of it to Little Black Snake.

504
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,280
What's wrong with him?

505
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:16,280
He left without saying goodbye.

506
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,280
He's still angry.

507
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,280
It's good that he's awake.

508
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,280
I was worried about him.

509
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,280
What's there to worry about?

510
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,280
He's really Little Black Snake.

511
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,280
He's a snake with a long heart.

512
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,280
I tried my best to take care of him.

513
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,280
But he left in the middle of the night.

514
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,280
He's so ungrateful.

515
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,280
Forget it.

516
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,280
You don't understand what I'm talking about.

517
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,280
I'm so sad.

518
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,280
I'm really sad.

519
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,280
I'm really sad.

520
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,280
You two talk. I'm leaving.

521
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,280
Hong Ning.

522
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,280
Thank you.

523
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,280
When I first saw you,

524
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,280
I felt very close.

525
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,280
Of course.

526
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:06,280
We were really good friends.

527
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,280
You saved my life.

528
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,280
The past is the past.

529
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,280
This is also the past.

530
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,280
By the way, White Tea.

531
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,280
I always want to ask you something.

532
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,280
In the last life,

533
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,280
Master and I...

534
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,280
Hong Ning.

535
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,280
If you remember the past,

536
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:25,280
you'll know that

537
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,280
you asked for Heaven's help for him.

538
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,280
But he actually...

539
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,280
He actually made you suffer.

540
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,280
What happened?

541
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,280
You asked for Heaven's help.

542
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,280
You asked for Heaven's help to save you.

543
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,280
But he didn't even see you.

544
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,280
He was deceived by the fairy in his palace.

545
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:49,280
He was beaten to death.

546
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,280
He was tortured by Heaven.

547
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,280
I'm worried about you.

548
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,280
The monster in the heaven said

549
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,280
he married the princess of the heart.

550
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:02,280
He ruined your engagement.

551
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,280
He made you fall into the flower pond.

552
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,280
You almost lost your soul.

553
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:07,280
How could he do this to you?

554
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,280
He's a real immortal.

555
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,280
There must be some misunderstanding.

556
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,280
Hong Ning.

557
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,280
I know you're kind and considerate.

558
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,280
You care for others.

559
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,280
Even if you're born as a human,

560
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,280
you still keep your original nature.

561
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,280
But as your friend,

562
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,280
I can't just leave you alone.

563
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:32,280
This is the water I brought back from the dragon pond.

564
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,280
As long as you drink it,

565
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,280
you'll know everything.

566
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,280
The Demon King's Magic

567
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,280
Stop.

568
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:51,280
Ning Meng Jing?

569
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:52,280
Why are you here?

570
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,280
I...

571
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,280
Master Wen Xun asked me to check

572
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,280
the situation of the demons.

573
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,280
You're weird.

574
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,280
I don't know what kind of energy they absorb.

575
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,280
But they become more energetic.

576
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,280
I heard from them

577
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,280
that it was the Demon King who gave them the magic power.

578
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,280
Demon King?

579
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,280
Who's the Demon King?

580
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
How would I know?

581
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,280
I'm not the Demon King.

582
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,280
Besides,

583
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,280
they're just saying it.

584
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,280
I can't just listen to them.

585
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,280
Okay.

586
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,280
I'll report to Master Wen Xun later.

587
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:24,280
Ning...

588
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,280
Ning Meng Jing.

589
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,280
What do you want to report?

590
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,280
Why did you lie?

591
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,280
I...

592
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,280
I fell in love with the dungeon

593
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:34,280
before Bai Bu Ju came in.

594
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,280
I...

595
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,280
I was so jealous.

596
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,280
The demons became more important.

597
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,280
Good for you.

598
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,280
You're really good at it.

599
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,280
You deserve it.

600
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,280
Nonsense.

601
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,280
This is my property.

602
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:45,280
How can I be fooled?

603
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,280
Go back.

604
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,280
Go to my room and punish me later.

605
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,280
Yes, Master.

606
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
You...

607
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,280
You...

608
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,280
You...

609
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,280
Your life

610
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:09,280
comes from the half-life of the Red Tea Flower.

611
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,280
In the future,

612
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,280
you'll be able to

613
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,280
kill the demons

614
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,280
and the demons.

615
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,280
I...

616
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,280
I'm...

617
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,280
I'm...

618
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,280
I'm...

619
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,280
I'm...

620
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,280
I'm...

621
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,280
I'm...

622
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,280
I'm...

623
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,280
I'm...

624
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,280
I'm...

625
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:28,280
I'm...

626
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,280
I'm...

627
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,280
I'm...

628
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,280
I'm...

629
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,280
I'm...

630
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,280
I'm...

631
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,280
I'm...

632
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,280
I'm...

633
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,280
In the future,

634
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,280
you can be Hong Ning.

635
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,280
Hong Ning?

636
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:46,280
You...

637
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,280
You know me?

638
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,280
Master Hua?

639
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:55,280
Jinxiu?

640
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,280
Can I be your queen?

641
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,280
Then,

642
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,280
you can be my immortal.

643
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,280
I'll marry you

644
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,280
before the Flower Festival.

645
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,280
Master Hua,

646
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,280
didn't you say

647
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,280
you wouldn't marry me?

648
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,280
Master Hua,

649
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,280
I won't be your guardian.

650
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,280
Stay with me.

651
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,280
Run!

652
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:39,280
Run!

653
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,280
Master Hua.

654
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,280
Master Hua.

655
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:16,280
The Flower Festival

656
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,280
is coming.

657
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,280
Do you still remember

658
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,280
the time when you were

659
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,280
in the palace?

660
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,280
I remember

661
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,280
the time when I was

662
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,280
in the palace.

663
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,280
I remember

664
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,280
the time when I was

665
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,280
in the palace.

666
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,280
Master Hua,

667
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,280
do you still remember

668
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,280
you said

669
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,280
you would marry me?

670
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,280
I remember everything.

671
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,280
I'm sorry.

672
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,280
There's no need to be sorry.

673
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,280
You protected me,

674
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,280
protected me from the fire,

675
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,280
and protected me from

676
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,280
growing up.

677
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,280
There's no need to be sorry.

678
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,280
I disappointed you.

679
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,280
I'm sorry.

680
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,280
I disappointed you.

681
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,280
But you still found me

682
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,280
in this life

683
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,280
and left me behind.

684
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,280
Hong Nian,

685
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,280
I will fulfill

686
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,280
my promise to you.

687
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,280
Before the Flower Festival,

688
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,280
I will marry you.

689
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,280
But

690
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,280
I'm a human.

691
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,280
My time,

692
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,280
my life

693
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,280
and my memories

694
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,280
are only for a few decades.

695
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,280
I'm afraid I don't have enough time to spend with you.

696
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,280
I'm afraid

697
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,280
I'm afraid my cultivation is not good.

698
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,280
I'm afraid I can't be with you.

699
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,280
I'm afraid

700
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,280
you're willing to be with me.

701
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,280
I don't want to lose you again.

702
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,280
I can't lose you again.

703
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,280
It's all my fault.

704
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,280
I was wrong for a long time.

705
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,280
How are you going to punish me?

706
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,280
I'll let you

707
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,280
be with me forever.

708
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,280
Okay.

709
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,280
Master,

710
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:19,280
I don't know what the flowers on the warehouse are reflecting.

711
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,280
They're all open.

712
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,280
Good spirit.

713
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,280
I'll go now.

714
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,280
Hong Nian,

715
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,280
this is...

716
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,280
The mint you gave me,

717
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,280
the wine we got married

718
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,280
is yours.

719
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,280
I heard something.

720
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,280
Married?

721
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,280
I'm sorry.

722
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,280
I'm sorry.

723
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:53,280
I...

724
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,280
Master,

725
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,280
I...

726
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,280
I...

727
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,280
I'm burning water on the fire.

728
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,280
I'll go and have a look.

729
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,280
Stop.

730
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,280
Master,

731
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,280
I'm sure I can't see anything.

732
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,280
I don't know anything.

733
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,280
I won't talk nonsense.

734
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,280
I swear.

735
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,280
Go tell everyone

736
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,280
that I'm going to marry Hong Ning.

737
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,280
Hong Ning,

738
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,280
do you remember?

739
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,280
Xiaobai,

740
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,280
I remember.

741
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,280
You're the white silk flower

742
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,280
I saved in the garden.

743
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,280
Great.

744
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,280
You remember.

745
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,280
Then...

746
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,280
Then we can go back to Mount Baizhou together.

747
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,280
Okay.

748
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,280
I'll go now.

749
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,280
I'll go now.

750
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,280
I'll go now.

751
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,280
I'll go now.

752
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,280
I'll go now.

753
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,280
I'll go now.

754
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,280
I'll go now.

755
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,280
I'll go now.

756
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,280
Then we can go back to Mount Baizhou together.

757
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,280
Xiaobai,

758
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,280
this is my home.

759
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,280
My parents are here too.

760
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:04,280
But...

761
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,280
But your roots are in Mount Baizhou.

762
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,280
I'm white tea.

763
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,280
You're red tea.

764
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,280
We're going to go back to Mount Baizhou to live together.

765
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:11,280
Although I remember

766
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,280
many things from my past life,

767
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,280
in this life,

768
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,280
I still have a lot of things to do.

769
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,280
I have my parents here.

770
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,280
The brothers who have been with me

771
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,280
and have been cultivating are also here.

772
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,280
And...

773
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,280
I promised Master to marry me.

774
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,280
I will live here in the future.

775
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,280
What?

776
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,280
He's just a liar.

777
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,280
He will hurt you again.

778
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,280
Why did you agree to marry him?

779
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,280
Xiaobai,

780
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,280
in the last life,

781
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,280
thank you for going to the Zhong Tian

782
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,280
and asking Master to save me.

783
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:46,280
But there are still many things

784
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,280
that you just heard.

785
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,280
He also has no choice

786
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,280
so he chose to marry the Heavenly Maid.

787
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,280
I also wanted to give him back his golden lotus root

788
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:01,280
so I jumped into the flower fairy pond.

789
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,280
And it was the night fire wall he protected me from.

790
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:06,280
So I could turn into a human.

791
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,280
The night fire on his body

792
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,280
was also because of me.

793
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,280
Hongning,

794
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,280
you can't be together.

795
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,280
He is an immortal and you are a demon.

796
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,280
The divine and the demon can't be combined.

797
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,280
You can only be with me.

798
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,280
Calm down.

799
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,280
Aren't we good friends?

800
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,280
I love you as a friend.

801
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,280
I love Master as a lover.

802
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,280
Do you understand love?

803
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,280
Love?

804
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,280
How can I not understand love?

805
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,280
I escaped from the Qilin Cave

806
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,280
just because I love you.

807
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,280
I can only be with you

808
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,280
because I love you.

809
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,280
That's why I can survive.

810
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,280
It's because I love you

811
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,280
that I can find you.

812
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:58,280
It's because I love you

813
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,280
that I risked my life

814
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:02,280
to go to the heaven to beg them to save you.

815
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:05,280
Hongning,

816
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,280
when I first saw you from the flower garden,

817
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,280
I fell in love with you.

818
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,280
Don't you feel anything?

819
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,280
What you said is not love.

820
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,280
True love is two people falling in love.

821
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,280
It's to love each other.

822
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,280
It's to hope that the other person can be happy.

823
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,280
That's love.

824
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,280
Okay.

825
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,280
One day you will understand

826
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,280
that I am the one

827
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,280
who loves you the most.

828
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,280
I will be your wife.

829
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,280

I will be your wife.

853
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:39,280

906
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,280
Hallики,

907
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:36,280
portrait,

908
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:38,680
he will cover you,

909
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,280
I must dodge the attack,

910
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,280
he is not you,

911
00:45:44,280 --> 00:45:45,280
you surely wrong.
