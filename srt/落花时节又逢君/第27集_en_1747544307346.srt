1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:14,600
My life is pampered, its tears Pressured and left alone inforder

2
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:22,600
The wind blows, the sea is full of dust

3
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:29,600
For you, I'll follow my life

4
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,600
Lest I get drunk

5
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,600
The name in the painting

6
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,600
Only wish the painting could be the memory

7
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:49,600
The Long Ballad

8
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,600
Episode 16

9
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,600
What I did last time made you laugh.

10
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,600
This time, I did a good research.

11
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,600
I found out that cooking is really a skill.

12
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Fry, fry, steam, boil, each has its own way.

13
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,600
It looks like you've improved a lot.

14
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Right? Try it.

15
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
Ah, no, no, no.

16
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,600
Ade, ad, ad

17
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,600
It won't make you laugh.

18
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,600
My father would always make breakfast for my mother when I was a kid.

19
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,600
And my mother always said it was delicious.

20
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Now that I think about it, her feelings at that time were just like yours.

21
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,600
What feelings?

22
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,600
Full of encouragement and sympathy.

23
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,600
It's okay.

24
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:26,600
My father made it delicious later.

25
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,600
I think I can do it too.

26
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:33,600
Speaking of which, I haven't seen General's house for so long.

27
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,600
I haven't seen General's parents yet.

28
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:41,600
They are all gone.

29
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,600
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
It's okay.

31
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,600
I grew up with my uncle and aunt.

32
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,600
My aunt was worried about my marriage.

33
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,600
Miss Su?

34
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,600
I've been fighting for my life.

35
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
I've been living and dying.

36
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,600
But I only love the world.

37
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:10,600
I only want to be an artiste like my father.

38
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:13,600
I want to make his favorite dishes every day.

39
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,600
I know very well that person is not Miss Su.

40
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,600
There will be a house for the housekeeper.

41
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,600
Your uncle and aunt will arrange it for you.

42
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,600
No, they won't.

43
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,600
Miss Su, would you like to go with me to the Prime Minister's house to pay respects to my uncle and aunt?

44
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,600
They are coming.

45
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,600
Master.

46
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,600
Master.

47
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,600
Greetings, uncle and aunt.

48
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,600
This is Miss Muxian.

49
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,600
Greetings, uncle and aunt.

50
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,600
Muxian is so handsome.

51
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Come in.

52
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Let's talk while eating.

53
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Thank you.

54
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
Come in.

55
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,600
Muxian, I don't know your taste.

56
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,600
This is Jinxiu's favorite, spring bamboo.

57
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Try it.

58
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,600
I made it myself.

59
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,600
See if it's good.

60
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
It's delicious.

61
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
No wonder Jinxiu likes it.

62
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,600
If you like it, eat more.

63
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Muxian, you don't know that Jinxiu is good at everything.

64
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,600
He is not interested in men and women.

65
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,600
These years, our aunts have been worried about him.

66
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,600
It's good that you met your favorite girl.

67
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,600
Yes, I should get married soon.

68
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
Yes.

69
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:35,600
If Muxian runs away, and Jinxiu doesn't marry her, what should we do?

70
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,600
What are you talking about?

71
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,600
Jinxiu is good.

72
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,600
He can talk and read.

73
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
You are so young.

74
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
You are the general of Wuzhang.

75
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,600
Yes, we are good.

76
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,600
I will give you a gift.

77
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,600
This is my dowry.

78
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,600
I think you are very elegant.

79
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,600
You must be a very special girl.

80
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,600
You must be very beautiful with it.

81
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,600
It's too expensive. I can't accept it.

82
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,600
Muxian, it's okay.

83
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,600
Take it.

84
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,600
Take it.

85
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Thank you, aunt.

86
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,600
After dinner, you can stay at the prime minister's house.

87
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,600
I will arrange it.

88
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,600
Yes, stay for a few more days.

89
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,600
I don't think you are enough.

90
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,600
What's the use of saying that?

91
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,600
I just want you to stay for a few more days.

92
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,600
I want you to know more.

93
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,600
Don't just talk.

94
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
You are so lucky.

95
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,600
You should drink more.

96
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,600
Yes.

97
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,600
Come on, drink.

98
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,600
I didn't ask you before.

99
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,600
Why did you get married?

100
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,600
I got married when I was young.

101
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,600
I was hurt by the demon.

102
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,600
I was young at that time.

103
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,600
But I clearly remember

104
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,600
that they were torn apart by the demon in front of me.

105
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,600
You didn't want to revenge?

106
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,600
I was incompetent when I was young.

107
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,600
But when I had the ability,

108
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,600
the demon that killed my parents had disappeared.

109
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,600
I became a general of the French.

110
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,600
I left the general's mansion alone.

111
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
I was determined to protect the peace of Wuzhang.

112
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
I was determined to protect the peace of Wuzhang.

113
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,600
I will never let the people of Wuzhang

114
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
be like me.

115
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,600
They are loved by their parents.

116
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,600
If I were you,

117
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
I would find the way.

118
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,600
I would find the way.

119
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,600
I used to think so.

120
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,600
I was obsessed with you.

121
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,600
I even thought that

122
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,600
demons in this world were all poisonous.

123
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,600
Later, I saw more demons.

124
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,600
But I also found that

125
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,600
demons are like humans.

126
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
They are good and bad.

127
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,600
They are not all bad.

128
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
If you don't revenge,

129
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
your parents will be angry.

130
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,600
Won't you be angry in the underworld?

131
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,600
I know you are as evil as an enemy.

132
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
But I often think that

133
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,600
my parents are in the underworld.

134
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,600
They may not want to see

135
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
my parents die of the evil.

136
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,600
Maybe they want to see

137
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
me be safe and happy.

138
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,600
I hope everything goes well.

139
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,600
If I were you,

140
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,600
I would find the way.

141
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,600
I will find the way.

142
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
I promise you

143
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
if one day you find the enemy,

144
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,600
I will help you.

145
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:32,600
I will find them and then blood debt will be paid.

146
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:37,600
I promise you, if one day you find your enemy, I will definitely help you.

147
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Catch in the lane!

148
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
There are so many.

149
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,300
They all broke in.

150
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
There's one missing still.

151
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,440
What are you doing?

152
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,400
Looks like...

153
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,060
There's already a hole...

154
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Do you know?

155
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,600
When I first saw you

156
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,600
I thought the smell of you

157
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,600
was very nice

158
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
But I can't remember

159
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
where I put it

160
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,600
Master

161
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
What's going on?

162
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
What did I do to you?

163
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
I was reckless

164
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,600
and made you lose your innocence

165
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,600
There is a monster in this mansion

166
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,600
It's a ghost who can be a secretary

167
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,600
If I don't have a skill, will I die?

168
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,600
Luckily, I don't have any ill intentions

169
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,600
towards you

170
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
If someone else takes my life

171
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,600
you have to be careful

172
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,600
What do you mean by luckily?

173
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,600
If it wasn't me today

174
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,600
and I didn't wake up

175
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,600
what would you do?

176
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,600
Didn't you wake up?

177
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,600
unusual

178
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,600
mysterious

179
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,600
General

180
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
Why did you call me out so late?

181
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,600
I've boyfriend's whereabouts

182
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
Speak

183
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,560
From childhood he was the nemesis of

184
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,560
zhouyao priest mu song

185
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,560
Nothing serious

186
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,280
I see.

187
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,000
General, why is your face so red?

188
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,240
Are you sick?

189
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,920
Shall I call the doctor?

190
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,280
No need.

191
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,560
Really? General.

192
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,280
No need.

193
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,480
Take care of yourself.

194
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,680
I said no need.

195
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,520
General.

196
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,760
Long life, never die.

197
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,360
No pain, no gain.

198
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,440
Long life, never die.

199
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,880
No pain, no gain.

200
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,640
Long life, never die.

201
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,880
No pain, no gain.

202
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:48,100
When did the

203
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,260
'.

204
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:55,260
You don't know who I am?

205
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,260
Have you had enough?

206
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,260
Have you had enough?

207
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,260
Master

208
00:16:26,260 --> 00:16:28,260
You want to seduce master?

209
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,260
You are a dog!

210
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,260
Master

211
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,260
Something is wrong

212
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,260
We should go find Jinxiu

213
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,260
Master

214
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,260
Master

215
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,260
Fresh meat

216
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,260
Do you want to try?

217
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,260
A'xiang is always plain

218
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,260
But today she put all kinds of expensive things on her body

219
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,260
It's strange

220
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,260
Not only that

221
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,260
She always eats only vegetarian food

222
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:52,260
But today she is eating fresh meat

223
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,260
So strange

224
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,260
We saw two servants and two maids fight

225
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,260
It's nothing

226
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,260
What's strange is

227
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,260
She also joined the fight during the fight

228
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:06,260
It's not like her

229
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,260
I wanted to fight

230
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:09,260
But I don't know what happened

231
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:11,260
The fire came up

232
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,260
I didn't listen to my master

233
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,260
Brother

234
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,260
Master

235
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,260
Did something dirty come into our mansion?

236
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,260
General

237
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,260
General

238
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:29,260
The guards outside the city have reported

239
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,260
Zeyu found seven bodies in the woods

240
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:37,260
I have something else to deal with

241
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,260
If the situation in the mansion is worse

242
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,260
Let me know at any time

243
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,260
Yes

244
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:43,260
Take care of yourself

245
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,260
Miss Muxian

246
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:52,260
My master and I will go to see my father first

247
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,260
Miss Lu Yao

248
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,260
You should go with me to see the situation of others and the third aunt

249
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,260
What do you think of the strange thing happened in the mansion in recent days?

250
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:24,260
I don't have any idea about the mansion

251
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:26,260
I passed by here a few days ago

252
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:29,260
I saw someone steal money

253
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:33,260
I can't see the Muxian

254
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,260
And now

255
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,260
You are joking

256
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,260
I just want to discuss my doubts with you

257
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,260
What doubts

258
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,260
It's just that you're a woman

259
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,260
You can't get married

260
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,460
What's the problem?

261
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,020
It's just a servant in the mansion

262
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,060
Just for fun

263
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,500
But someone lost control

264
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,500
and made a bad position with the commoners

265
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
Are you talking about

266
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,500
General Jinxiu and you?

267
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,940
Except for the beauty

268
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,940
I can't think of any other reason

269
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,460
Then where do you think the beauty comes from?

270
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,620
The only thing I know

271
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,620
is that the nine-tailed fox uses beauty

272
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:16,620
What do you want to say?

273
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,620
Finally you admit

274
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,620
that you know I'm the nine-tailed fox

275
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,620
I don't know

276
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,620
In Wuzhang Kingdom

277
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:28,620
the only one who knows my real identity

278
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,620
is Hongming

279
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,620
You say it's a human, it's a human

280
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,620
You say it's a demon, it's a demon

281
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,620
I'm just a demon-seeker

282
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,620
I just want to find the truth

283
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,620
That's why I'm here to ask you

284
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,620
You're a woman

285
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:44,620
It's easier to talk to you

286
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,620
I didn't expect to cause so much misunderstanding

287
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,620
As for what you said about Hongming

288
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,620
I really don't know

289
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,240
Commentating His Majesty This Is Huadi

290
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,580
I am just a person who practices

291
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,980
I don't have any demon deputy

292
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,980
Since you don't know the name Hongning

293
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,980
Just forget it

294
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,980
I'm just a master who helps Kunlun

295
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,980
I'm just here to help Jinxiu get rid of the demon.

296
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,780
And I'm not in a fight with your Kunlun.

297
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,780
You don't have to be so determined.

298
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,180
And,

299
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:32,380
are you sure that the chaos in the mansion has nothing to do with your sister?

300
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,180
I'm sure.

301
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:34,780
Okay.

302
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,580
Then continue to be your fairy.

303
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,580
General,

304
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:53,780
this is the villagers who died suddenly yesterday.

305
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,180
You found them in the woods.

306
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,180
They are completely fine.

307
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,580
What happened?

308
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,380
The wood stick has not been burned yet.

309
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:10,980
The evil aura has long been in the body.

310
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,380
Why are you here?

311
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,180
I'm afraid something will happen to you.

312
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:18,580
Are you worried about me?

313
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,580
What happened to them?

314
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:27,180
All these people died in the evil aura.

315
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,180
Tell me.

316
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,580
What happened?

317
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,780
You didn't say anything good before.

318
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,980
Why did you suddenly fight?

319
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,180
And you, Ah Xiang.

320
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,780
Your jewelry looks precious.

321
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:42,780
These are all fake.

322
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,380
Why did you suddenly wear them today?

323
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,180
Okay.

324
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,580
Are you okay?

325
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,180
I'm fine.

326
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,580
What are you doing?

327
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:10,780
Come on.

328
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,380
Drag them out.

329
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,980
All of you, get out of here.

330
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,180
Auntie Ning.

331
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:19,980
Why are you here?

332
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,380
You are not suitable for this situation.

333
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,380
You go back first.

334
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:24,780
Be careful not to get hurt.

335
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,180
I...

336
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:29,980
I'm here to see if Kunlun is already so scared.

337
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,580
Why are you suddenly saying this?

338
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:33,380
Kunlun,

339
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,380
come closer to me.

340
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,980
I want to take a good look at you.

341
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,580
Okay.

342
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:40,380
Kunlun.

343
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:51,780
Kunlun.

344
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,780
Master, what's wrong with you?

345
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:55,580
Kunlun, are you okay?

346
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,980
What's going on?

347
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,580
Stop.

348
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,580
Madam.

349
00:23:59,780 --> 00:23:59,980
Madam.

350
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,580
Mother.

351
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,380
Someone is here.

352
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:02,180
Mother.

353
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,180
What's wrong with you?

354
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,580
Mother, wake up.

355
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,980
Mother, wake up.

356
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,580
Why are the other bodies missing?

357
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,580
Have those bodies

358
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,780
already been taken back by their families?

359
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,380
Why is this sentence alone?

360
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:37,780
What is this?

361
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:52,780
Kunlun.

362
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,780
Kunlun.

363
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:54,780
Kunlun.

364
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:55,780
Kunlun.

365
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,780
Kunlun.

366
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,780
Kunlun.

367
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,780
Kunlun.

368
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,780
Kunlun.

369
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,780
Kunlun.

370
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,780
Kunlun.

371
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:02,780
Kunlun.

372
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,780
Kunlun.

373
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,780
Kunlun.

374
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,780
Kunlun.

375
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:06,780
Kunlun.

376
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:07,780
Kunlun.

377
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,780
Kunlun.

378
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,780
Kunlun.

379
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,780

I will kill her myself.

519
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,380
I will also kill her family

520
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:16,860

521
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,260
You really don't love her anymore?

No.

524
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,540
You used the Qilin Herb I gave you to save her.

525
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,260
You don't want to live with her.

526
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,420
Since I saw my parents

527
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:27,420
die in the fire,

528
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,500

disappeared into the forest.

539
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,260
I don't know if they are fake like the tigers.

540
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,660
They have been sent to track down the wolves.

541
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:15,060
Check the nearby area.

542
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,260
Is there any trace of the dead?

543
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,260
No.

544
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:18,860

Leave this to me.

580
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,460
Okay.

581
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:27,460
Be careful.

582
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,460
What do you mean?

583
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,460
We will take this man.

584
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,860
You dare to rob General Jinxiu's men?

585
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,860
The current king has orders.

586
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,860
Even the general,

587
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,860
you can't stop him.

588
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:56,860
I'm sorry.

589
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:57,860
Take him away.

590
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,860
What's wrong with my eyes?

591
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,860
Chief.

592
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,860
No.

593
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,860
Chang próxima.

594
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,860
Are you here?

595
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,860
I am.

596
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,860
If you want this,

597
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,860
you have to be very careful.

598
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:25,860
I will leave this to you.

599
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,860
Okay.

600
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,860
Go.

601
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,860
Leave.

602
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,860
Be careful.

603
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,860
Don't be차o too hard.

604
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,860
Take care.

605
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,860
Leave.

606
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,860
Go.

607
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:17,860
I can feel the warmth of the warm and warm spring

608
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:22,860
Master, why are you so nice to me?

609
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,860
It's not a big deal

610
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,860
I will always be by your side

611
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,860
I will never disappoint you

612
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:52,860
I want to kiss your shoulder

613
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,860
I will always be by your side

614
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,860
You are always by my side

615
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,860
You don't want to?

616
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,860
Yes, I do

617
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,860
I am very happy

618
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:54,860
Last time, it was my fault

619
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,860
I didn't expect to find it so easily

620
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,860
I lost myself

621
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:03,860
Don't mention the last time

622
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,860
Okay, I won't

623
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,860
It's just...

624
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,860
It's just...

625
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,860
I have a question to ask

626
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,860
Have a good rest

627
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,860
If I don't ask this question

628
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,860
I'm afraid my wound won't get better

629
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,860
What do you think of me?

630
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,860
What do you think?

631
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,860
Who?

632
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:42,860
Master

633
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,860
That master

634
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,860
Does he look like me?

635
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,860
You are not him

636
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,860
Is he bad to you?

637
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,860
Or he doesn't like you?

638
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,860
It has nothing to do with you

639
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,860
I don't care who he is

640
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,860
What happened between you?

641
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,860
He made you so sad

642
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,860
Don't think about him

643
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,860
I said it has nothing to do with you

644
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:24,860
I don't have the ability to meet you sooner

645
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:29,860
But I am content to meet you

646
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:32,860
Drink water is not good

647
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,860
I have to compete with him

648
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,860
Drink the medicine

649
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:01,860
Drink the medicine

650
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,860
It's not your fault

651
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,860
Cry if you want

652
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:38,860
Don't hold it in

653
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,860
I know

654
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,860
Second aunt has always been close to you

655
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,860
So you should cheer up

656
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,860
And give her an explanation

657
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,860
I remember when I was a kid

658
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,860
I had a cold

659
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,860
I had a fever

660
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,860
I couldn't get a doctor

661
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:03,860
Second aunt took care of me

662
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,860
She took care of me

663
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:10,860
So you think I hurt her?

664
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,860
No, master

665
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,860
I didn't mean that

666
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,860
I know you did it to protect me

667
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,860
Now that you know

668
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,860
You should understand

669
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,860
I didn't mean to hurt you

670
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,860
I am not a doctor

671
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,860
Yes

672
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,860
She will hurt me

673
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,860
Look at the family

674
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,860
The lord has fallen

675
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,860
What?

676
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,860
Kui Lun

677
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,860
Now you are the only one in the house

678
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,860
We can only rely on you

679
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,860
My father is sick

680
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,860
Yes

681
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,860
Hundreds of people in the house

682
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,860
Now people are in panic

683
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:11,860
They can only rely on me

684
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,860
They need you

685
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,860
Don't run away

686
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,860
Be responsible

687
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,860
Even for me

688
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,860
Ok

689
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,860
I understand

690
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,860
I can't escape from this responsibility

691
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,860
I must find out the truth

692
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,860
I believe you

693
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:14,860
Stop it

694
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,860
Stop it

695
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,860
Stop it

696
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,860
Stop it

697
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,860
Go home

698
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,860
Go home

699
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,860
Hit

700
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,860
Why don't you hit?

701
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:37,860
Come on

702
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,860
Hit

703
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,860
Since you don't hit

704
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,860
Please listen to me

705
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,860
Go home

706
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,860
Master

707
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,860
Everyone knows

708
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,860
Something happened in the prime minister's house

709
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,860
The political situation is chaotic

710
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,860
From today on

711
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:01,860
You can't tell others about the prime minister's house

712
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,860
Otherwise

713
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,860
You will be punished

714
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,860
The injured in the house

715
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,860
The treatment of the medicine

716
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,860
You can only rest in peace

717
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,860
But everyone

718
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,860
You need to report to the housekeeper

719
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,860
All the unusual things

720
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,860
Everything needs to be recorded

721
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,860
Give me the record

722
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,860
If you have a guest visiting your parents

723
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,860
Tell the prime minister

724
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,860
He is sick and can't visit

725
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,860
Any questions?

726
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,860
If anyone has doubts

727
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,860
I won't stay

728
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,860
You can go to the account

729
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,860
To get money and leave the house

730
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,860
But from now on

731
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,860
The prime minister's house has nothing to do with him

732
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,860
Do you understand?

733
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,860
Yes

734
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,860
The situation is strange

735
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,860
The position is strange

736
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,860
There seems to be something

737
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,860
In the desire of these people

738
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,860
And the blind body has already been transferred to the new house

739
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,860
Why did you appear in the city

740
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,860
Recently I feel

741
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,860
My body is getting heavier

742
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,860
In the city

743
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:09,860
Many people died

744
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,860
Many people died

745
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,860
Many people died

746
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:15,860
Many people died

747
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:17,860
Many people died

748
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,860
Many people died

749
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:21,860
In the middle of the night

750
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,860
There seems to be a power

751
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:25,860
Controlling them

752
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,860
General, you are looking for me

753
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,860
You go with me to the former mansion

754
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:31,860
Then I will go to prepare the horse now

755
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,860
In the dream

756
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:51,860
What is the reason for the love

757
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:53,860
What is the reason

758
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,860
The long road

759
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,860
The past has long gone with the wind

760
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,860
When

761
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:03,860
The wind and the cloud

762
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,860
Meet

763
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,860
The love

764
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,860
That is full

765
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,860
The love

766
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,860
The wind blows away this life

767
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,860
The heart is in the past

768
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,860
In the past

769
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,860
The cloud has been

770
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:23,860
Only a cloud

771
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,860
Oh

772
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:29,860
Falling

773
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:31,860
Time

774
