1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I am drunk.

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The beautiful scenery in the painting

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
is waiting for the falling flowers to return.

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The Long Ballad

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Episode 16

6
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Welcome, Your Majesty.

7
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
His Majesty is currently cultivating the art of sea-crossing.

8
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
If he is disturbed, he will make a great contribution.

9
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This matter will be discussed by all the Qing families.

10
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Rumor has it that the power of the Demon King can summon the god of the forest.

11
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,000
The forest will be able to recover for thousands of years.

12
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Now, the power of the Northern Immortal Emperor

13
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
has been raised to the level of the power of the Demon King.

14
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
This matter is very important.

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
If His Majesty is not here...

16
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I have been fighting in the West Sea for many years.

17
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Imperial Physician, do you not trust me in handling this matter?

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I dare not.

19
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Then start discussing this matter.

20
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The Demon King is a sworn enemy of the Immortal Realm.

21
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
The Demon King was killed by His Majesty in the Qilin Cave

22
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
ten thousand years ago and was destroyed.

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
The power of the Demon King is being restored.

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
There are only two reasons.

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
The Demon King is dead.

26
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Or the power of the Demon King has been inherited.

27
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
The fire of the Qilin is the power of the ancient beast, the Qilin.

28
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Once it is contaminated, it will be destroyed.

29
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
There is no chance of survival.

30
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I think the Demon King has left a trace.

31
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Now, we are struggling with the cause and effect.

32
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
There is no way to fix it.

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,000
The only way is to wipe out the power of the Demon King.

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
After that, we will go to the Dragon Pool in the West Sea

35
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
to investigate the source of the power of the Demon King.

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Your Highness, this Dragon Pool is the territory of the Northern Immortal Realm.

37
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
It is not appropriate to go there rashly.

38
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
The Northern Immortal Realm is in a bad state.

39
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The power of the Demon King is a big matter in the Three Realms.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I will not appear to investigate it.

41
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
When will you come?

42
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Your Highness, you are wise and virtuous.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Dong Xuan, it's you.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I will kill you.

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Don't hurt the Heavenly Maid.

46
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
What Heavenly Maid?

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
She is just a fox demon.

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Jiasheng, today, I will eliminate two evils in the mortal realm.

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
If the Three Realms can really endure the Five-He,

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
that wild fox will not be defeated by me.

51
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Where is A'Jiu?

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I've been seeking for a sword for a long time.

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I've been practicing for a hundred years and I've suffered a lot.

54
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I have no skills.

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I ask myself.

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Where is the real power of the world?

57
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I will find it.

58
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I will find it.

59
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
I will find it.

60
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I will find it.

61
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I will find it.

62
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I will find it.

63
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I will find it.

64
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I will find it.

65
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I will find it.

66
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
You are a demon.

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I am a demon.

68
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
But where is evil?

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Evil means demon.

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Bullshit.

71
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
But I'm fine.

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
So you said that I'm a demon.

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Who am I?

74
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What am I made of?

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Where is my sword?

76
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
What's wrong with being a demon?

77
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,640
you've been cursing for hundreds of years.

78
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,320
Listen,

79
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,000
a demon is born to be a demon.

80
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,720
It's a rightful and just person.

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,920
It's a true heaven and earth.

82
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,560
You can't even see through this?

83
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,520
Just kill yourself.

84
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,720
A demon is born to be a demon.

85
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,760
It's a rightful and just person.

86
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,320
I'm a demon who doesn't believe in ghosts.

87
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,200
I'm a demon.

88
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,280
I'm a demon.

89
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,280
Who am I?

90
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,720
I'm a demon.

91
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:29,920
Brother Huni.

92
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,400
Jiu.

93
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:31,400
Listen.

94
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:31,760
Jiu.

95
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,160
Brother Huni,

96
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,240
are you in his belly all the time?

97
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,520
Brother Huni.

98
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,480
Jiu.

99
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,120
Brother Huni.

100
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,560
Huni, how are you?

101
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,880
Do you feel uncomfortable?

102
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,880
You're worried about me?

103
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,400
I feel...

104
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,720
Matron.

105
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,880
I've seen the story of the painting.

106
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,440
I think

107
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,160
I've developed feelings for you.

108
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,640
Actually, I wouldn't have stayed on the mountain for long.

109
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,720
I wouldn't...

110
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,680
I wouldn't have kept this feeling.

111
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:38,000
But I just found out

112
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,520
that I can't let go.

113
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,920
My parents said that when I was little,

114
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,280
there was a gentleman who was always with me.

115
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,000
There was a gentleman who was always with me.

116
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,520
I always wanted to find him.

117
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,040
Although you never admitted it,

118
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,280
I think you are the gentleman.

119
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,040
Actually, I'm not saying this

120
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,680
to get any answers

121
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,880
or to make you promise me anything.

122
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,600
It's just that today,

123
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,640
I feel very dangerous

124
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,960
at this evil dragon pond.

125
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,360
I don't know if we can get out of here.

126
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,640
That's why I...

127
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,080
That's why I said it.

128
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,160
I've said it all.

129
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,040
What's that?

130
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,680
I promise you

131
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,560
to take care of you well.

132
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:36,840
I promise you

133
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,560
that I'll be by your side

134
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,680
for life.

135
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,640
I were happy until then

136
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,520
Feels so unreal

137
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,080
But with you

138
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,240
I can finally be shown

139
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,480
in front of the 62nd rank

140
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,040
My 발

141
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:55,440
Right

142
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,040
My legs

143
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,360
It's like flying

144
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,560
like you

145
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:07,960
It's like that

146
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,960
I bought it for you.

147
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,720
I came for you recently.

148
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,480
Alright.

149
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,320
Master.

150
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:04,840
warriors

151
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:07,680
I need a 채 Andrew

152
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,560
When we found him,

153
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,400
he was already like this.

154
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,520
I put magic power into him,

155
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,520
but he was so strong.

156
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,560
He's injured the internal energy.

157
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,640
We need to save him as soon as possible.

158
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,320
Master Hong Yi.

159
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,200
Jiu.

160
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,360
We can't stay here for long.

161
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,400
Let's leave here first.

162
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:38,880
Master.

163
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,840
I have something to ask you.

164
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,480
Let's talk about it after we leave here.

165
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,240
Master.

166
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,160
Are you okay?

167
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,800
Master.

168
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,720
I can take you two back to the warehouse at the same time.

169
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,400
Let's go.

170
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,240
Let's go.

171
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,520
Master.

172
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,480
I'll go get some water.

173
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,200
Okay.

174
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,680
Master, please wait for me.

175
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,680
I'll go get some water.

176
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,360
Okay.

177
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,440
Master.

178
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,160
Heavenly Maid.

179
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,400
Why did Hong Ning become a mortal?

180
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,200
She lost the Golden Lotus Robe of the Northern Immortal Realm,

181
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
saved her soul,

182
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,720
and crossed the Night Fire Bridge.

183
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,080
How could she have the Transformation Order?

184
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
Lord Zhong Tian

185
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,000
took her across the Night Fire Bridge.

186
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,560
So you were exposed to the Night Fire.

187
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,880
I didn't expect

188
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,200
you would do such a thing for her.

189
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,080
But have you ever thought

190
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,200
that she's a demon

191
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,880
and you're the future Lord Zhong Tian?

192
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,680
You two will never be able to be together.

193
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,200
The Night Fire wound on my body can't be healed.

194
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,880
I can't be a monster for her.

195
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,080
I can't be a monster for her.

196
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,080
It's enough to

197
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,480
suffer less

198
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,320
for some things.

199
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,240
Lord Zhong Tian is so clever.

200
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,880
The Golden Lotus Robe of the Northern Immortal Realm

201
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,800
was given to you so easily

202
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,080
to please the little girl.

203
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,440
Heavenly Maid.

204
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,920
I'm sorry for you.

205
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:02,040
I'm sorry for the Northern Immortal Realm.

206
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,480
I'll repay you in the future.

207
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,280
Don't say that again.

208
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,640
What will you repay me with?

209
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,360
Although you're now

210
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
staying safe in Cangwu Mountain,

211
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,480
don't expect me to take your love.

212
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,120
Let me take Lu Jiu away.

213
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,280
He's the blood of the Northern Immortal Realm.

214
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,960
He's the prince of the Northern Immortal Realm.

215
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,440
It was the Northern Immortal Realm who ordered

216
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,760
to put him in the Qilin Cave.

217
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,680
Now you're taking him back.

218
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,680
I'm afraid it's not a good thing

219
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,760
for him.

220
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:43,880
Yes.

221
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,160
I've been separated from him since I was a child.

222
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,080
I can only secretly check his news.

223
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,960
I was

224
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,240
cowardly

225
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,760
and timid at that time.

226
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,760
Now I've suffered the consequences.

227
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,800
Now

228
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,880
I'm taking him back.

229
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,360
He needs to take back

230
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,440
the debt owed by the Northern Immortal Realm.

231
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:32,800
What's wrong with you?

232
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,240
Hongning.

233
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,280
You're

234
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,960
White Tea

235
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,240
Demon?

236
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,640
You still remember me?

237
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,120
Are you okay?

238
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,200
I just know Chu Yao since I was a child.

239
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,200
Do you know me?

240
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,640
I just know you.

241
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,360
I'm White Tea.

242
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,160
You saved my life.

243
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,160
I didn't expect

244
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,160
I could see you alive.

245
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,400
It's really a coincidence.

246
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:22,680
Don't talk.

247
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,960
You're badly injured.

248
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:25,440
I'll take you to see Master.

249
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:27,600
I'll go with you.

250
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,360
Yes.

251
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,160
What's wrong?

252
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,000
Hongning.

253
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,880
I'm content to see you.

254
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,480
And you don't have any memory now.

255
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,960
I know you're kind.

256
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,520
But they

257
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,320
may not accept me.

258
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,760
It's okay. Don't worry.

259
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,120
Master is not that kind of person.

260
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:55,640
Let's go.

261
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,280
Master.

262
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,040
I met someone on the road.

263
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,960
He said he knew me.

264
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,040
And he was badly injured.

265
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,160
White Tea.

266
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,680
You know each other?

267
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,280
How did you escape from Qilin Cave?

268
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,640
Lord Shen Zhen.

269
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,960
I didn't expect

270
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,760
we could meet again.

271
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,160
When I heardquisite stars like Thanksgiving

272
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:32,960
were used with the

273
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,120
Menu.

274
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,840
I didn't expect you still remember me.

275
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,160
It has nothing to do with you.

276
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,720
It's totally unrelated to me.

277
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,440
Master, do you remember

278
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,680
why I was left

279
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,320
in Qilin Cave?

280
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:48,320
I was moved.

281
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,480
How much pain did I suffer

282
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,920
to escape from there?

283
00:16:59,240 --> 00:16:59,920
Hou Ning.

284
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,080
I'd better go.

285
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,840
It's no big deal

286
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,040
to be hurt.

287
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:06,960
I'm glad to see you.

288
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:08,640
You've made me feel better.

289
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,960
Even if I die,

290
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,920
I'm willing to do it.

291
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,320
Don't say such unlucky words.

292
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,960
Master, he...

293
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,960
I had my responsibility

294
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,680
for not saving you.

295
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,800
Come back to the warehouse

296
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,400
with us.

297
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,440
Thank you, Master.

298
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,480
As your savior,

299
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,040
I think you should tell me

300
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,280
what's your relationship with Brother Lu Jiu,

301
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:48,360
and Master.

302
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,760
And that shadow.

303
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,280
You can't even afford to eat.

304
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,960
How did you get to know so many men?

305
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,760
None of your business.

306
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,480
I just want to know

307
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,000
what kind of person I saved.

308
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,000
You'll know when you should know.

309
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,640
Now I've told you too much.

310
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,920
You don't understand.

311
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,840
I really want to taste your blood.

312
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,640
It must be cool.

313
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,840
It's not your natural coolness.

314
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,240
I'm not cool.

315
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm just a little bit.

316
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,400
Oh my god.

317
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,240
Why are you so late?

318
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,120
Late?

319
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,480
I'm telling you, Master.

320
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,400
You don't know.

321
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,080
His Majesty suddenly called for the heavenly soldiers

322
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,680
to guard the heaven.

323
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,320
I'm in a hurry.

324
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,600
And you're so late.

325
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Master,

326
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,080
what happened

327
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,800
at the Dragon Pool that day?

328
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,800
Don't worry about that.

329
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,840
Help me cover up.

330
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:11,840
I want to go to heaven.

331
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,840
What's wrong?

332
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,840
What's wrong with you?

333
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,840
Are we really going to

334
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,840
be at the edge of death?

335
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,840
No, okay?

336
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,840
No, no.

337
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,840
Now I can't think of any other way

338
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,840
except for heaven.

339
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,240
Old Ju, you're self-sacrificing.

340
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,240
I can't care about you anymore.

341
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,840
No, no, no.

342
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,440
How can I self-sacrific?

343
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:30,840
I'm just a paper.

344
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,840
I'm just a little flower.

345
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,240
What have I become?

346
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,840
What kind of life have I lived?

347
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,840
I'm afraid of this life

348
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:38,840
with my life at stake.

349
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,840
Let go.

350
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,840
I'm not afraid of you.

351
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:41,840
Let go.

352
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
I really can't care about you.

353
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,840
I can't.

354
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,840
I count to three. Let go.

355
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,840
Three, two, one.

356
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,840
Let go.

357
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,840
Master.

358
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,840
Master.

359
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,840
Go.

360
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,840
Go.

361
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,840
This...

362
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,840
Come in.

363
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,840
Master, if you don't come out

364
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
after being forced to close the coffin,

365
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,840
I'll be so worried.

366
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,840
It's only been three days.

367
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,840
Drink the medicine.

368
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,840
Let me.

369
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,840
Is that red tea flower

370
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,840
the person you once liked?

371
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,840
What are you thinking about?

372
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,840
Nothing.

373
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,840
Master,

374
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,840
if you don't like the flowers

375
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,840
I fed you,

376
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,840
then next time I'll...

377
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,840
I'll just drink it.

378
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:07,840
I'll drink it.

379
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,840
I'll drink it.

380
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:09,840
I'll drink it.

381
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,840
It's not that I don't like it.

382
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,840
It's just...

383
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,840
I've never had it before.

384
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,840
It's a little...

385
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,840
It's a little strange.

386
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,840
You've never had it before?

387
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,840
Not even in heaven?

388
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,840
How are Bailing and Lu Jiu?

389
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,840
They're recovering very well.

390
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,840
They're very lively.

391
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:35,840
That's good.

392
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,840
That's good.

393
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,840
You don't mention anything about that red tea flower.

394
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:51,840
Master,

395
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,840
don't you have anything

396
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,840
to ask me?

397
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:05,840
Then,

398
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:07,840
have a good rest.

399
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:11,840
I'll go.

400
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,840
I... I didn't see anything.

401
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:25,840
I didn't see anything.

402
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:27,840
You...

403
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,840
Don't you have anything to say to me?

404
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:41,840
You can go now.

405
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:42,840
I'll go now.

406
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,840
I'll go now.

407
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,840
I'll go now.

408
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,840
Why are you following me?

409
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:06,840
I

410
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,120
I'm here to see you off.

411
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,560
I want to ask you to see me off.

412
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,560
I'm not familiar with you.

413
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:13,840
Why should I see you off?

414
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:18,760
Bai Ling.

415
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,240
You're here at the right time.

416
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,120
You're the guest.

417
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:23,480
You can take care of it.

418
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,120
Your Highness.

419
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Your Grace.

420
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,720
Get up.

421
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,120
I found out

422
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:02,960
Lord tripartite

423
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,980
is replaced

424
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:04,920
because of this matterful matter

425
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,400
at Tiendeätta.

426
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,480
Yes.

427
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,360
Master Jinxiu met a mortal girl

428
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,560
in the lower realm.

429
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,360
He often asked the Immortal Lord

430
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:12,920
about...

431
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,760
About what?

432
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:15,440
About...

433
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,000
about love.

434
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,000
As expected.

435
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,480
Do we need to send someone to stop him?

436
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,800
In case he will stop the Star of Heaven and Earth

437
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,800
from making a fuss in the lower realm.

438
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,800
No need.

439
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,320
Keep watching.

440
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,080
Yes.

441
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,080
You are serving the Empress.

442
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,080
Empress.

443
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,480
How is it?

444
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,840
The Demon King ove

445
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,840
had made a mark in the Gorge of Demons,

446
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,480
but the Demon King's power

447
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:02,920
is now in another part.

448
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:03,920
Where is it now?

449
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,240
Where the star of the world is.

450
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,280
Cangwu Academy.

451
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,320
Greetings, Your Majesty.

452
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,160
I know I'm against the heaven rule.

453
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,440
But I have no other choice.

454
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,480
I can only ask you.

455
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,720
May I ask you,

456
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,720
is the power of the demon king

457
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,240
the power of Hong Ning?

458
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,920
Can you

459
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,500
help me

460
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,520
leave for the place

461
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,820
where you flourished before?

462
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,800
This way.

463
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:05,920
Don't change my mind.

464
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,920
Please have.

465
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,160
Yanyu Think this way.

466
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,320
Shall I hit?

467
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,360
I don't think you should.

468
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:31,920
I can set out now.

469
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,520
No!

470
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,520
for crow business.

471
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:34,960
Therefore,

472
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,760
it'll beIncription.

473
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,280
I'm really grateful

474
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,080
for your repay.

475
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,720
You have deep roots,

476
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,480
and can�t be worldlyorts soon.

477
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,960
Thanks, teacher.

478
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,320
I wish that you won't battle.......

479
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,200
course,

480
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,400
I hope you are polite and discreet.

481
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,920
You'll lead our cranes

482
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,160
to become immortal

483
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,380
and humans to tame and be righteous.

484
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,280
Between the first episode ofvida wild Dragon Hall,

485
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,680
I can see

486
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,840
all of your responsibility

487
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:03,720
I'm very pleased.

488
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,000
Master,

489
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,560
you praise me so much.

490
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,760
I feel a little embarrassed.

491
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,280
Tian Nan Xing.

492
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,920
Tian Nan Xing has achieved something.

493
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,800
From today on,

494
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,360
you can practice Cheng Kung Fu.

495
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,200
Thank you, Master.

496
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,400
Bai Bu Qu.

497
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,520
Bai Bu Qu is a profound and deep knowledge.

498
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:32,920
From today on,

499
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,520
you are a disciple of the Zheng clan.

500
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,040
Thank you, Master.

501
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,480
Master,

502
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,400
I have a request.

503
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:40,520
Go ahead.

504
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,880
Since I've been practicing,

505
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,720
I've only had a little bit of knowledge in theory.

506
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,120
But my Kung Fu has improved a little.

507
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,320
So I want to follow my brothers

508
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,360
to get rid of the demons.

509
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,160
To catch demons, you need to practice basic Kung Fu.

510
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,760
If you can't do it,

511
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,120
you'll be in danger.

512
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,360
How about this?

513
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:55,560
From today on,

514
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,000
you go guard the dungeon.

515
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,040
The dungeon is guarded by demons from all walks of life.

516
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,440
If you're familiar with them,

517
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,680
you can catch demons

518
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,280
and get rid of them.

519
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:04,680
Thank you, Master.

520
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,760
I won't let you down.

521
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,640
It's such a boring job.

522
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,600
He's so happy.

523
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,720
When you go guard the dungeon,

524
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,000
you'll celebrate it with wine.

525
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:15,960
Am I?

526
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,240
Lu Yao has been staying in my cell for a long time.

527
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,720
She'll leave soon.

528
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,320
Lu Jiu,

529
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,000
Lu Yao saved you

530
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,480
from danger.

531
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,240
You should escort her

532
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,600
to keep her safe.

533
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,960
Master, I won't go.

534
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
I'm very grateful.

535
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:38,880
I didn't agree.

536
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,720
Master asked you to go.

537
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,360
You don't want to go, either?

538
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:44,120
I...

539
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,320
Fine.

540
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,960
Why me?

541
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,440
Why me?

542
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,840
Be clear.

543
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,760
I'm a human.

544
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,280
You're a demon.

545
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,920
In terms of rank and rank,

546
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,680
she should choose me first.

547
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,920
Did you hear me?

548
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,680
I...

549
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,080
You're talking to yourself, aren't you?

550
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,680
I'm enjoying the flowers.

551
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,720
Your little red tea flower

552
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,320
doesn't look good.

553
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,120
I haven't asked you

554
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,520
since I came back from the Dragon Pool.

555
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:15,320
Do you still want to stay in the cell?

556
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,600
If you don't want to,

557
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,920
I won't force you.

558
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,760
But

559
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,360
I don't want you to be like the other day

560
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,640
and put yourself in danger.

561
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:32,360
So you want me to stay

562
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,040
because you're afraid that I'll be in danger?

563
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,520
Didn't you say

564
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
I should focus on my true self?

565
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,080
My true self is

566
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,600
to keep you by my side

567
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,960
all the time.

568
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,600
I asked for this to give you

569
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,280
spoken martial arts

570
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,080
and to help you practice.

571
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,440
Soaring up to the sky

572
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,320
and maturing.

573
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,880
You search around the world.

574
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,600
I will search you.

575
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:23,680
So

576
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,680
This is our love token.

577
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,040
Come on, let's eat.

578
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,500
Why are you here?

579
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,360
To see how You

580
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,240
mercilessly dissipated the wine.

581
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,880
and make yourself feel more at ease.

582
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,560
I'm leaving.

583
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,440
Bring the wine with you.

584
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,880
Use it to hide your feelings.

585
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,160
No one's awake.

586
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,600
Your Majesty.

587
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,480
Your Majesty.

588
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,120
It's all right.

589
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,080
Just let me stay.

590
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,880
Other women hate me.

591
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,440
Your Majesty.

592
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,440
Even though only three of us would know,

593
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,840
we, who fight for our lives,

594
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:17,440
are useless.

595
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,240
When you recover your memories,

596
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,440
you'll understand.

597
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,440
Look, we're practicing martial arts now.

598
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,440
It's boring.

599
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,440
I've been trained enough.

600
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:55,440
Why are Master and Hongning so close?

601
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,440
They've been through a lot.

602
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,440
They've killed innocent people

603
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,440
in the dark.

604
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,440
It's a pity that Master can't tell us.

605
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,440
You dare to say that?

606
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,440
I don't dare.

607
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,440
Women are the most affected by cultivation.

608
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,440
They can't be touched.

609
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,440
Senior,

610
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,440
have you ever heard of a cultivation called

611
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,440
copper cultivation?

612
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,440
I've been used to it.

613
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,440
It's boring.

614
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:31,440
Impossible.

615
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,440
I'm a master of the martial arts.

616
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,440
But I met some good women.

617
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,440
They're all beautiful, gentle, and smart.

618
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:46,440
It's a pity that I was only seeking for Taoism.

619
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,440
When I went down the mountain,

620
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,440
it was the time when women were suffering.

621
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,440
It's all my fault.

622
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,440
I can't be only focused on it.

623
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
Let me tell you.

624
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,440
I can only be shared by women.

625
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,440
I can't be the only warrior.

626
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,440
Senior,

627
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,440
you've only met one woman in Hongning.

628
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,440
How can you imagine that?

629
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,440
I admire you.

630
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,440
Junior, what are you doing?

631
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,440
Are you going to drink and get rid of your hatred for Lu Yao?

632
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,440
I think

633
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,440
it's a good chance to build a temple for the Heavenly Maid.

634
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,440
It's a good chance to build a relationship with her.

635
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,440
Let's drink.

636
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
Come on.

637
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,440
Let's drink.

638
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:40,440
Come on.

639
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,440
Let's drink.

640
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,440
Come on.

641
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,440
Let's go.

642
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,440
I'm leaving too.

643
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:09,440
Come on.

644
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,440
Come on.

645
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,440
Who is it?

646
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,440
Ah Jiu,

647
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,440
what's wrong with you?

648
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,440
Are you the Heavenly Maid?

649
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,440
No.

650
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:47,440
I heard that

651
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,440
the Heavenly Maid can fulfill her mission.

652
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
Heavenly Maid,

653
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,440
can you let me grow nine tails?

654
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,440
You can grow nine tails when you grow up.

655
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,440
Really?

656
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,440
She lied to you.

657
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,440
You can't grow nine tails, either.

658
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,440
She lied to you.

659
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,440
She lied to you.

660
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,440
She lied to you.

661
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,440
She...

662
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,440
She lied to you.

663
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,440
You can't grow nine tails, either.

664
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
She lied to you.

665
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
She lied to you.

666
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,440
She lied to you.

667
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,440
Ah Jiu.

668
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
She lied to you.

669
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,440
Ah Jiu.

670
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,440
Ah Jiu.

671
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,440
Did you have a nightmare?

672
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,440
W signature on reality check right now,

673
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,440
but it's a dinner date.

674
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,440
Better sleep.

675
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,440
Fine.

676
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,440
Well.

677
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,440
Where are we?

678
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,440
The 바다� pretty much besides the river at Gan Zhou county

679
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
Gal at Gan Zhou state?

680
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,600
Are you going to Xu Yun Temple?

681
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,200
Why are you here?

682
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,120
I...

683
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,800
I want to do something else first.

684
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,800
Then hurry up.

685
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:15,920
After I send you off,

686
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,560
I have to go back to my Cangwu Mountain.

687
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,840
Do you like that place?

688
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:23,800
Of course.

689
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,640
My master

690
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,760
and those brothers who are worried about me

691
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,800
are waiting for me.

692
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,720
If one day,

693
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,640
you have to leave that place.

694
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,840
There won't be that day.

695
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:40,360
As long as my master is still here,

696
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,440
even if he drives me away,

697
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,880
I won't leave.

698
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:54,800
What's wrong with you?

699
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:55,920
Are you drunk?

700
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:57,880
I'm fine.

701
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,440
Then you are...

702
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,280
Then you are in pain?

703
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,320
Your wound is bleeding.

704
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,400
Didn't you notice it yourself?

705
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:06,600
I'll find you some medicine.

706
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,520
Wait for me.

707
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,720
He has grown up into a very good person.

708
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,840
Do you want to ask me

709
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,760
why I don't show my identity to him?

710
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:39,920
I don't know.

711
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,240
But I think

712
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,680
he must hate me and my father.

713
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,000
If I tell him my real identity,

714
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,320
will he treat me like this?

715
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:03,360
Bai Cha, you are awake.

716
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:04,960
I woke up yesterday.

717
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,520
I'm so happy to see you.

718
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,040
I didn't want to bother you.

719
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:10,720
You are a guest.

720
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,440
It's your duty.

721
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,200
What's wrong?

722
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:18,600
Hou Ning,

723
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,800
men and women are different.

724
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,520
You should force me to do it.

725
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,680
Didn't you say

726
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,200
we were friends in the last life?

727
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:27,840
I was afraid that

728
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,120
you would be afraid of me.

729
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,160
I was afraid that

730
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,400
you would be afraid of me.

731
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,680
We are friends.

732
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:34,360
Friends don't need to be so close.

733
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,960
In the last life,

734
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,840
we were really good.

735
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,440
Every time I was bullied,

736
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,720
you stood up for me.

737
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,000
You always thought of me and helped me.

738
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,400
But then everything

739
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,080
was broken.

740
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,920
Broken?

741
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:50,920
Why?

742
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,240
Because of some unhappy things.

743
00:42:56,120 --> 00:42:56,720
Hou Ning.

744
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,200
Master, you are here.

745
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:00,760
You...

746
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,200
Bai Cha is awake.

747
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,360
Help him to check it.

748
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:05,240
I've asked Wenxin to make some medicine.

749
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,240
Go and get it.

750
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,240
I'll see how he is doing.

751
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:10,520
Can't I stay here?

752
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:11,240
Nonsense.

753
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:13,000
How can a girl do that?

754
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:15,520
Okay.

755
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:26,400
Master,

756
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,160
what a coincidence.

757
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,200
Hou Ning is a mortal.

758
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,800
She is naive and innocent.

759
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:34,200
I don't want her to be troubled

760
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,840
because of the past.

761
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,760
You don't want

762
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:38,920
or you don't dare?

763
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,000
Master is selfish.

764
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:44,120
You don't want to remember

765
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,560
the past of your father.

766
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,280
So you let us

767
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,320
die with her.

768
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:52,320
Mortals are born and die.

769
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,720
They hate each other.

770
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,040
They are all empty when they enter the past.

771
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,320
But you still remember her.

772
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,200
I remember her too.

773
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,160
You can be a star even if you don't want to forget her.

774
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,320
She is innocent

775
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,920
but she is set for life.

776
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,360
Master.

777
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,520
Have you ever asked her

778
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,640
if she is willing to?

779
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:14,600
Don't forget.

780
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:16,880
All her pain

781
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:17,880
is because of you.

782
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:20,520
She is impossible.

783
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,720
What's the benefit

784
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,120
if you keep her in your heart?

785
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,080
No need to say more.

786
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,600

787
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,200
I will send you back to Baizhou Mountain.

788
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,960
You can cherish it

789
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,280
for a while.

790
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,480
No way.

791
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:43,680
Hongning.

792
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,520
