1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:51,920
Y after round

2
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,920
Fall into my heart

3
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,920
For a lifetime of hero

4
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,920
Full of tears

5
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,920
I look at the red city

6
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,920
The wind blows the sea

7
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,920
The mountains pass the dust

8
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,920
For you, I will follow for a lifetime

9
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,920
Lest I get drunk

10
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,920
The name in the painting

11
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:44,920
I look forward to the reunion of the painting

12
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,920
The Long Ballad

13
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,920
Episode 14

14
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,920
Greetings, Your Majesty.

15
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,920
Is there any news about Jinxiu?

16
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,920
Where is General Man Wu?

17
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:08,920
Your Majesty, the demons in the lower realm gathered in Mount Baizhou.

18
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,920
They are about to have a fight. General Man Wu is handling it.

19
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,920
I let him go down the realm

20
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,920
just to find Jinxiu.

21
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,920
But now,

22
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,920
I haven't found the person I should find.

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,920
He is involved in something that has nothing to do with the antidote.

24
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,920
If the demons gather in Mount Baizhou,

25
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,920
I will burn the mountain

26
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,920
so that they have nowhere to escape.

27
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,920
Why bother?

28
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,920
Then, are the demons in Mount Baizhou sneaking into the Qilin Cave or...

29
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:51,920
They are in the lower realm.

30
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,920
There is no need to act too seriously.

31
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,920
Your Majesty, please think about it.

32
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,920
The demons have to sneak into the Qilin Cave after the trial.

33
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,920
It is not proper to do so.

34
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,920
I have made up my mind.

35
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,920
Don't say anything more.

36
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,920
Yes.

37
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,920
Kunlun, what do you think?

38
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,920
Father, I think

39
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
it is best to find Jinxiu now.

40
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,920
There is no need to waste time on those unknown demons.

41
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,920
Also, General Man Wu has worked hard

42
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,920
to capture the red lotus tea demon.

43
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,920
I hope to go with him

44
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,920
to find Jinxiu soon

45
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,920
and fulfill your wish.

46
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,920
It is indeed rare

47
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,920
for you to think so.

48
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,920
Then, you lead the army

49
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,920
to go down the border with General Man Wu.

50
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Remember,

51
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,920
don't act rashly when you see Jinxiu.

52
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,920
Take your brother back to Zhong Tian first.

53
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,920
Yes, Father.

54
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Kill! Kill!

55
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,920
Brothers of the demons,

56
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,920
the Heaven Realm has been impure

57
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:35,920
and has been oppressing us.

58
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,920
The red lotus tea demon has injured the Heavenly Emperor.

59
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,920
The God of Heaven Realm has been exiled.

60
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,920
Now, it is the right time

61
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:49,920
for us to take the opportunity to escape.

62
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,920
Kill! Kill!

63
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,920
I have the responsibility to lead you

64
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:01,920
and all the demons in the world to fight against Zhong Tian.

65
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:06,920
I am also concerned about the demons.

66
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,920
But at this time,

67
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:14,920
there are demons who are trying to sow discord and spread rumors.

68
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,920
Kneel!

69
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,920
We just don't want to follow you.

70
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,920
We came to Mount Baizhou to follow Hong Ning.

71
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,920
Mount Baizhou is so safe now.

72
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,920
The Heavenly soldiers didn't come to kill us.

73
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,920
It is for our own sake that we have to die.

74
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,920
Report! Report!

75
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,920
We just received news that

76
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,920
the six ears heard that the Heaven Realm was going to attack Mount Baizhou.

77
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,920
You all heard it, right?

78
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,920
Kill! Kill!

79
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,920
From now on,

80
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,920
who dares to rebel?

81
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,920
This is the end.

82
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,920
Now you have seen

83
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:15,920
how Zhong Tian treats our demons.

84
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,920
If we don't fight today,

85
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,920
we will only end up with the death of the King.

86
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:23,920
We must use the way of the Qi people

87
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,920
to return the body of the Qi people.

88
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,920
Kill!

89
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:34,920
Kill! Kill!

90
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,920
Who did it?

91
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:47,920
They followed the red tea demon to the area of Mount Baizhou.

92
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:54,360
They were killed by the three

93
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,920
with the three fire.

94
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,920
Good.

95
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,920
The people of the Northern Heavenly Realm

96
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,920
are fighting with Kunlun.

97
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
They are getting more and more arrogant.

98
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,920
If that is the case,

99
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,920
I will not spare that three-headed fox.

100
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,920
General!

101
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,920
Why are you so loud?

102
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
The Emperor has ordered

103
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,920
to go to Mount Baizhou with the Kunlun God next year.

104
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,920
What a joke!

105
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,920
I am the God of War.

106
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,920
How can I go to the world with a little boy?

107
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,920
This must be Kunlun's idea.

108
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,920
Fine.

109
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,920
I will see

110
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:33,920
what Kunlun can do.

111
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,920
Kunlun.

112
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,920
I heard everything.

113
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,920
Lu You,

114
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,920
are you very angry with me?

115
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:48,920
Now you are in a relationship with Man Wu.

116
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,920
You are becoming a person you hate.

117
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,920
Are you afraid that

118
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,920
Man Wu has done too much

119
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,920
and hurt them?

120
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,920
You have to go there personally.

121
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,920
How do you know this?

122
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,920
I have known you for so long,

123
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,920
how can I not understand how you feel?

124
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,920
Aren't you afraid that

125
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,920
not everyone can tell you what you believe?

126
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,920
Isn't this all because

127
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,920
of Hu Jingxiu and Hongning Zhou Quan?

128
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,920
I understand. You don't need to explain these to me.

129
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,920
You know me best.

130
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,920
Thank you.

131
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:33,920
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't know how to get through this.

132
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,920
I'm afraid.

133
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,920
Why are you afraid?

134
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,920
The anger is constantly erupting.

135
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,920
The three realms are in turmoil.

136
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,920
The war between the immortals and demons is starting again.

137
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,920
It's a sure thing.

138
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,920
This is the end of the world.

139
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,920
I'm afraid.

140
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,920
I'm afraid.

141
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
I'm afraid.

142
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,920
It's a sure thing.

143
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,920
This anger originated thousands of years ago.

144
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,920
It originated in the Qi Lin Cave.

145
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,920
It originated in you.

146
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,920
Everything has a destiny.

147
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,920
Father.

148
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,920
Father.

149
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,920
Father, is that you?

150
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:52,920
If it's you, tell me what you will do.

151
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:58,920
Father, I will never catch up with you.

152
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:02,920
Ten thousand years ago,

153
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:06,920
I was in the desert.

154
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,920
Ten thousand years ago,

155
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,920
for the sake of the three realms,

156
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:21,920
I made up my mind to re-establish the three realms.

157
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,920
I exchanged my feelings with the Heaven Book.

158
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,920
Am I doing the right thing?

159
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,920
Now, this anger

160
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,920
comes from that war.

161
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,920
He was entangled with the demon king.

162
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:46,920
He didn't know how to repent.

163
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,920
He jumped into the Qi Lin Cave and died.

164
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:57,920
I kept the Jin Xiu who was forced by the Qi Lin.

165
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,920
I thought that by letting Jin Xiu take over the throne,

166
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,920
his Qi Lin blood could be used to stabilize the three realms.

167
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,920
I made a mistake in all of this?

168
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:10,920
Father, tell me.

169
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,920
Is there any way

170
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:17,920
to continue to protect the three realms

171
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,920
and make it a long-lasting peace?

172
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,920
Is there any way?

173
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,920
Is there any way

174
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,920
to make up for my fault?

175
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,920
Father!

176
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,920
The throne is not in your hands.

177
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,920
You are just making a fool of yourself.

178
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,920
Father!

179
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,920
Father!

180
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,920
Father!

181
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,920
Father!

182
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,920
What do you mean by this?

183
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,920
Father! Where are you?

184
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,920
Father!

185
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,920
Father!

186
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,920
Are you okay?

187
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,920
We've known each other for so long.

188
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,920
You don't have to act so tough in front of me.

189
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,920
I can also be your support.

190
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,920
I know what you want to say.

191
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,920
I don't agree.

192
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,920
We can talk about other things.

193
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,920
But this matter

194
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,920
is not good.

195
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,920
He killed my parents.

196
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,920
But he raised me.

197
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,920
I have to go see him

198
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,920
to ask for an explanation.

199
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,920
But I don't want you to be in danger.

200
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,920
You know better than me

201
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
what kind of person he is.

202
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
He doesn't have to do anything.

203
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,920
Maybe he already knew

204
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,920
that you had found out the truth.

205
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,920
I don't want you to have any problems.

206
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,920
I don't want you to risk your life.

207
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,920
I don't want you to leave me alone.

208
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,920
Okay.

209
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,920
Hong Chao.

210
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,920
I used to let you practice.

211
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
I thought that

212
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,920
only by practicing would you be eternal.

213
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,920
Now I think

214
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,920
it's good to be a little monster

215
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,920
or a mortal.

216
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,920
Cry if you want.

217
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
Laugh if you want.

218
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,920
Love and hate are like six jade.

219
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,920
Now you don't feel

220
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,920
anything.

221
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,920
Yes.

222
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,920
King Zhong Tian,

223
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,920
the one who punishes,

224
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,920
the God,

225
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:36,920
you have been

226
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,920
subdued by these names.

227
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:44,920
You seem to have been given a lot of power.

228
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:46,920
But these are not important

229
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,920
to me.

230
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,920
To me,

231
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,920
I am Hong Chao.

232
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,920
You are Jinxiu.

233
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,920
Yes.

234
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,920
I am only Jinxiu.

235
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,920
My Jinxiu.

236
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,920
I didn't believe in fate before.

237
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,920
But now I think

238
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,920
it's because of the God's blessing

239
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,920
that you are far away from the trouble

240
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,920
and the things.

241
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,920
And I

242
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:28,920
only hope that you can be happy

243
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,920
and be your true self.

244
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:47,920
I am sorry.

245
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,920
I am sorry.

246
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,920
I am sorry.

247
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,920
I am sorry.

248
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,920
I am sorry.

249
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,920
I am sorry.

250
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,920
I am sorry.

251
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,920
I am sorry.

252
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,920
I am sorry.

253
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,920
I am sorry.

254
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,920
I am sorry.

255
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,920
I am sorry.

256
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,920
I am sorry.

257
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,920
I am sorry.

258
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,920
I am sorry.

259
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,920
I am sorry.

260
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,920
I am sorry.

261
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,920
Jinxiu.

262
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,920
I will deal with something that comes up.

263
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:43,920
No, I won't

264
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,440
Since you want to go

265
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,520
I will go with you

266
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,840
This time, we escape to Baizhou Mountain

267
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,480
No need to take Liuqiang

268
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,880
Yes

269
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,360
Wait

270
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,320
I haven't appeared yet

271
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,840
General Manwu will give orders without permission

272
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,760
To disobey the order

273
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,040
To be arrested

274
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,320
Double crime

275
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:10,760
According to the rules

276
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,560
How to deal with it

277
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,640
Kunlun Heavenly Army is late

278
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:16,880
I thought I was afraid

279
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,760
Dare not appear

280
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,720
General Manwu

281
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,480
What should I do when I see the leader?

282
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,160
Greetings to Kunlun Heavenly Army

283
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,760
Greetings to Kunlun Heavenly Army

284
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,440
The lower ranks are all here

285
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,120
The emperor's order

286
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,600
Involves the safety of the three realms

287
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,560
My Kunlun Army

288
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,000
No one is dead

289
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,400
Today

290
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,600
Since I am the commander of the whole army

291
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,400
Naturally, I can't bear to leave

292
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,840
General Manwu, the general

293
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,240
If General Manwu

294
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,440
Still want to play other small ideas

295
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,440
After we come back

296
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,360
One by one

297
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,280
General Manwu

298
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,360
Yes

299
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,640
Heavenly Army

300
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,520
Yes

301
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,240
This time, the lower ranks

302
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:13,160
All listen to me

303
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,720
As the order

304
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,240
Send it to the heart of the flower

305
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,880
Yes

306
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,520
The guilty Jinxiu broke into the middle heaven

307
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,720
Listen to the emperor's order

308
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,520
Take it down

309
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,440
Jinxiu Mountain King

310
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,440
Jinxiu Mountain King

311
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
Jinxiu Mountain King

312
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,440
Jinxiu Mountain King

313
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,440
Jinxiu Mountain King

314
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,440
Never

315
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,680
You are still here

316
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,240
The Qilin Cave has been locked

317
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,440
Soul Beads have been solved

318
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,880
You already know who you are now

319
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,080
I want more than that

320
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,880
What do you want to know?

321
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,840
Why did you kill them?

322
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,320
Kill?

323
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,720
I told the world again and again

324
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,080
Don't mess with the low-ranking demon clan

325
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,000
But he just didn't listen

326
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,720
Watching the conflict between the immortals and demons increase

327
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,960
At that critical time

328
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,720
He actually took the dog and the demon king and gave birth to the mud

329
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,560
This is the great shame of my Zhong Tian

330
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,800
It's him who has the lower rank of the demon

331
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,720
Misunderstood his own reputation

332
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,240
They do not fit the heaven

333
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,040
You ask the heavenly book master every day

334
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,440
Observe the new embroidery every night

335
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,680
What is heaven?

336
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,560
You are a golden moon demon

337
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,720
Use your own body as a path

338
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,360
It's not wrong

339
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,400
It's hard to tolerate

340
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,080
Don't forget who you are

341
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,640
I did not forget

342
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,080
I am the son of the demon king

343
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,320
The son of the heart

344
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,600
It's you who want to kill people as soon as you go

345
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,760
Don't forget your fate

346
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,800
What you have now is me

347
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,080
I am the paper line

348
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,760
We are different

349
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,760
Demon is a Bronze Man.

350
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:08,760
You set up the lie of the Immortal Demon.

351
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,760
You used the so-called Heaven's Law to deceive the three realms.

352
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:18,760
But this so-called Heaven's Law is just a devil's trap in your heart.

353
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,760
You are really a demon.

354
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:30,760
You are so evil.

355
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,760
Why don't you admit that this is your parents' fault?

356
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,760
The whole world is the same as them.

357
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,760
I saved the three realms.

358
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,760
I stopped the great battle in front of the world.

359
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,760
Ji Xiu.

360
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
Mother.

361
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,760
Do you remember the red tea flowers I planted in the yard?

362
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,760
You take good care of them.

363
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,760
You gave me the red tea flowers the year after next.

364
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,760
Ji Xiu.

365
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,760
Rabbit.

366
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,760
Rabbit.

367
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
Where is the rabbit?

368
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
What's wrong?

369
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,760
What's wrong with you?

370
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,760
What's wrong with you?

371
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:03,760
Come on.

372
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,760
Rabbit.

373
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,760
Rabbit.

374
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,760
Rabbit.

375
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
Rabbit.

376
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,760
It's you.

377
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,760
What have you done?

378
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,760
Don't you know what I did?

379
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,760
It seems that I have a connection with you.

380
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,760
Although we never met face to face,

381
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,760
we have a lot of similarities.

382
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,760
Shut up.

383
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,760
How could I be similar to a despicable person like you?

384
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,760
Mount Baizhou was supposed to protect the demons.

385
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,760
You actually killed the innocent here.

386
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,760
Innocent?

387
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,760
Without the help of your Three-Sister Fire,

388
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,760
those so-called demons in Cangwu Mountain

389
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,760
would have been so happy.

390
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,760
What kind of mercy are you pretending to be?

391
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,760
What did you say?

392
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,760
You don't know?

393
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,760
Cangwu, your Three-Sister Fire

394
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,760
really helped me a lot.

395
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,760
You were so easily angered by the incident of Wuzhang.

396
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,760
Tell me.

397
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,760
Is it because we have similar experiences

398
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,760
that we have such a connection?

399
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,760
So you were the one who killed me.

400
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,760
You're disgusting.

401
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,760
I feel sorry for you.

402
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:46,760
You have been struggling from the bottom of the earth.

403
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,760
How about this?

404
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,760
Don't follow Jiang Xiuying.

405
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
What about me?

406
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:56,760
Maybe I'm the most evil person in this world.

407
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,760
You?

408
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,760
You don't even deserve to be a god's shoes.

409
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,760
Shameless bastard.

410
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,760
What the hell are you going to do?

411
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:06,760
Forget it.

412
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,760
I wanted to leave you a life for me.

413
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:13,760
If so, go to hell.

414
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,760
You are short of days.

415
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,760
Jump over.

416
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,760
Let me plow away your feet with just one line.

417
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,760
Remember the가지고 I taught you.

418
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:35,760
It's three more hours to kill all the Demons.

419
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,760
Turn around.

420
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,760
There's only one die to kill them all.

421
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,040
I'm strong enough.

422
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,960
The path of cultivation is slow.

423
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,560
How can you be so lucky?

424
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,960
I'm the strongest king

425
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,800
in the three realms.

426
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,160
Demon-slaying.

427
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,800
Lu Jiu.

428
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,360
Lu Jiu.

429
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:25,920
Lu Jiu.

430
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,480
I know you.

431
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,360
You gave me your finery once.

432
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,840
I thought you would live.

433
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,840
I have been fighting with the Red Caps all day long.

434
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,840
To be friends with them, I have to be a good friend.

435
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,840
To make a high-level mouth,

436
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,840
it's really a great honor.

437
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,840
Today,

438
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,840
I will teach you a good lesson.

439
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,840
Uncle!

440
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:12,840
Uncle!

441
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,840
Uncle! Uncle!

442
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,840
How are you?

443
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,840
Uncle, why did you do this to me?

444
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,840
Because I am your uncle.

445
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,840
I'm sorry.

446
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,840
I lied to you.

447
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,840
Actually,

448
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,840
when I was in the warehouse,

449
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:38,840
I was already killed by the White Caps.

450
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:42,840
But I can't bear to leave you.

451
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,840
I can't bear to leave you and the Red Caps.

452
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,840
I have been looking for you.

453
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,840
My soul is only supporting me.

454
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,840
Uncle,

455
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,840
we have known each other before.

456
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,840
Not only have we known each other,

457
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,840
we have always been

458
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,840
very good friends.

459
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,840
Very good friends.

460
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,840
Very good friends.

461
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,840
Very good friends.

462
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,840
Very good friends.

463
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,840
Very good friends.

464
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,840
Very good friends.

465
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,840
Enough.

466
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,840
The idle talk is over.

467
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,840
Today,

468
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,840
I will send you off

469
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,840
to be good friends.

470
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,840
Uncle!

471
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,840
I ask you,

472
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,840
if I had gone to the warehouse

473
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,840
with you,

474
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,840
would our situation

475
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,840
not be the same?

476
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:56,840
I will answer.

477
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,840
Uncle!

478
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,840
Uncle!

479
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,840
Uncle!

480
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,840
Uncle!

481
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,840
Uncle!

482
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,840
Go!

483
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,840
I will die because of me.

484
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,840
I can't live in a mess.

485
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,840
I will kill you, evil!

486
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,840
You?

487
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,840
You want to kill me?

488
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,840
You are a bad person.

489
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,840
You are a real poor person.

490
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,840
You will not be

491
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,840
punished by God.

492
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,840
You will only be a prisoner.

493
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,840
You are just a white silk flower

494
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,840
on the mountain of Baizhou.

495
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,840
You are nothing compared to others.

496
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,840
You are nothing compared to others.

497
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,840
You are nothing compared to others.

498
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,840
You are nothing compared to others.

499
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,840
If it wasn't for the sword in your hand,

500
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,840
you would have been useless.

501
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,840
What are you talking about?

502
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,840
You are nothing.

503
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,840
What are you talking about?

504
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,840
Ning Meng!

505
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,840
Ning Meng!

506
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,840
Ning Meng!

507
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,840
No wonder your father

508
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,840
was so angry with you.

509
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,840
Only three tails of nine tails.

510
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,840
They are really pitiful.

511
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,840
I am really interested in your tail.

512
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,840
One tail is a thousand years old.

513
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,840
Nine tails are a hundred years old.

514
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,840
Even though you only have three tails,

515
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,840
you will be enough.

516
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,840
Ning Meng!

517
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,840
You are not able to escape.

518
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,840
This chain

519
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,840
is made by the divine bone you removed.

520
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,840
Don't struggle anymore.

521
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,840
The one who locks you

522
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,840
is always yourself.

523
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,840
Jinxiu,

524
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,840
you were born

525
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,840
to bless

526
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,840
our ancestors' lives.

527
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,840
To make sure that everything in the Heaven Realm is safe.

528
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,840
Even if you

529
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,840
lose the power of the Demon King,

530
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,840
you will not be able to escape

531
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,840
from this heavy responsibility.

532
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,840
Remember,

533
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,840
everything I do,

534
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,840
everything you do,

535
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,840
is for the sake of the three realms.

536
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,840
This is very worthwhile.

537
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,840
Hong Ning!

538
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,840
What are you doing here?

539
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,840
I came to find you.

540
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:40,840
This has nothing to do with you.

541
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,840
Leave!

542
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,840
We can still be separated by life and death.

543
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,840
You are not aware of your own mistakes.

544
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,840
You are blaming me.

545
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,840
Who is not aware of his own mistakes?

546
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,840
Hong Ning!

547
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,840
You should have let her

548
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,840
die in the past.

549
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:18,840
I shouldn't have let you

550
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,840
use the divine bone to kill her.

551
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,840
I must thank you for your kindness.

552
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,840
Hong Ning!

553
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,840
Someone has discovered

554
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,840
the traces of Prince Lu Jiu in Mount Baizhou.

555
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,840
Mount Baizhou is now a dangerous place.

556
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,840
Zhong Tian is sending troops to encircle it.

557
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,840
I'm worried that

558
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,840
it will be bad for Prince Lu Jiu.

559
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,840
You must not tell Heavenly Maid about this.

560
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,840
She is a new guard.

561
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,840
She must be taking risks.

562
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,840
The Northern Xianjian is now in danger.

563
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,840
We must not get involved in such a war.

564
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,840
General!

565
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,840
General, there are very strong demons ahead.

566
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,840
They are just a group of wolves.

567
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,840
It's a waste of time.

568
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,840
Isn't the Red Tea Demon

569
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,840
a group of demons that are not fair?

570
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,840
Today, I will take the Mount Baizhou down.

571
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,840
The Red Tea Demon will come out.

572
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,840
Yes!

573
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,840
Wait!

574
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,840
We are here to capture the Red Tea Demon

575
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,840
and find the God Jinxiu.

576
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,840
We must not hurt the innocent!

577
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,840
Did Lord Kunlun

578
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,840
live under his brother's wings for too long?

579
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,840
Such a rich and weak person

580
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,840
is so weak.

581
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,840
Lord Kunlun, don't forget that

582
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,840
demons are just the most worthless garbage in the three realms.

583
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,840
In this world,

584
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,840
we can only share the same mind.

585
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,840
Why do we have to care about

586
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,840
the garbage that should exist?

587
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,840
Lord Kunlun, you have been

588
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,840
protecting these demons for so long.

589
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,840
How can you have the courage

590
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,840
to unite the three realms?

591
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,840
General Ma Wu,

592
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,840
I have not fought with you

593
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,840
because you are an old general.

594
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,840
But if you insist on

595
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,840
getting involved in this,

596
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,840
don't blame me for being rude.

597
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,840
So, you two are not good at fighting.

598
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,840
You can't choose a leader.

599
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,840
You two are fighting

600
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,840
and you are even trying to get the inner peace.

601
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,840
I have been watching you for a long time.

602
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,840
You didn't send people to fight,

603
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,840
nor did you intend to attack us.

604
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,840
Is this big battle

605
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,840
just to come and fight with me?

606
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,840
Are you afraid

607
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,840
or are you scared?

608
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,840
When did you

609
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,840
become so cruel?

610
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,840
You little demon,

611
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,840
how dare you speak so wildly?

612
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,840
Heavenly Emperor's order

613
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,840
sent me to lead General Ma Wu and

614
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,840
all the heavenly soldiers to capture Hong Cha Yao.

615
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,840
Hong Cha Yao assassinated the Heavenly Emperor

616
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,840
and he is not guilty.

617
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,840
I will capture him in Mount Baizhou.

618
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,840
If you hand over Hong Ning,

619
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,840
I will spare your lives.

620
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,840
But if you defy the Heavenly Order,

621
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,840
you will be punished by the Heaven.

622
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,840
Your Majesty!

623
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,840
Your Majesty!

624
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,840
Did you hear that?

625
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,840
We are not like you

626
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,840
who are fake immortals.

627
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,840
You can try it.

628
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,840
See if our demon

629
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,840
will be as weak as you

630
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,840
and as ruthless as you.

631
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,840
Brother Long.

632
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,840
You are so impatient.

633
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,840
It's not over yet.

634
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,840
Stop!

635
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,840
Bai Cha,

636
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,840
give me back my sword.

637
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,840
What you said

638
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:56,840
is the nonsense of this crippled tail.

639
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,840
Don't give it back to me.

640
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:00,840
I will absorb a lot of grudges

641
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,840
and become a thorn in your side.

642
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,840
I dare not kill her.

643
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,840
When she creates more grudges,

644
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,840
it's too late.

645
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,840
Kill her!

646
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,840
I dare not kill her.

647
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,840
I dare not kill her.

648
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,840
I dare not kill her.

649
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,840
Let's go.

650
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,840
Go!

651
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:24,840
Let's go.

652
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,840
Let's go!

653
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,840
You are not afraid?

654
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,840
I'm afraid, too.

655
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,840
Let's go.

656
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,840
Let's go.

657
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,840
What are you doing?

658
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,840
I'm going to kill her.

659
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,840
No!

660
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,640
It's really hurt the hearts of our loyal and wise generals.

661
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:50,840
Today, the generals are outside, and the army is inside.

662
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,840
I will take these evil demons out of the roots for the loyal and wise generals.

663
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:02,840
Since you're all here, don't be so polite.

664
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,840
None of you can leave.

665
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,840
This is the yard.

666
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,840
So you're the source of the Wuzhang Kingdom.

667
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:24,840
Yes, it's me.

668
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,840
I'm just a little demon.

669
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,840
I'm like the god of the Worms.

670
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:30,840
I can't even stand the power of the dead.

671
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,840
I'm so weak.

672
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:38,840
How do you know I'm struggling and suffering?

673
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,840
I'm born like this.

674
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:43,840
I've created the most powerful power in the world.

675
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,840
Don't talk nonsense.

676
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,840
You're going to find an excuse for your own evil.

677
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,840
Isn't it?

678
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,840
I was born so high and high.

679
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,840
I'm not a big enemy.

680
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,840
I've been seriously testing all the events in this world.

681
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,840
I've never been despised or underestimated.

682
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,840
You don't have the right to judge me.

683
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,840
I'm not a demon.

684
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,840
Ajiou!

685
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,840
Even if you're the prince of the Immortal Realm,

686
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,840
your heart will still be hatred and hatred.

687
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,440
You're the dirty

688
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,840
and dirty enemy of the Ming Kingdom.

689
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:33,840
I believe that even if you're the god of Kunlun,

690
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:36,840
your heart will still be a dark soul.

691
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,840
Kill me, or we won't be able to pass the test.

692
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,840
All you want is Ajiou.

693
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,840
Come.

694
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,840
Don't think too much.

695
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:12,840
Lu You, leave now.

696
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,840
The dark abyss is created by hatred.

697
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:16,840
You can't always be against it.

698
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:36,840
Aaaaaaah!

699
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,840
The Heavenly Lord is no more than this.

700
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,840
Now, he's still not at my mercy.

701
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,840
If that's the case,

702
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,840
then let's just use him.

703
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,840
I'm sorry.

704
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,840
I'm sorry.

705
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,840
I'm sorry.

706
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:12,840
I'm sorry.

707
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,840
I'm sorry.

708
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,840
I'm sorry.

709
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:18,840
I'm sorry.

710
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,840
I'm sorry.

711
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,840
I'm sorry.

712
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:24,840
I'm sorry.

713
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:26,840
I'm sorry.

714
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,840
I'm sorry.

715
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,840
I'm sorry.

716
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,840
I'm sorry.

717
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,840
I'm sorry.

718
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,840
I'm sorry.

719
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,840
I'm sorry.

720
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,840
I'm sorry.

721
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,840
I'm sorry.

722
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,840
I'm sorry.

723
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,840
I'm sorry.

724
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,840
I'm sorry.

725
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,840
I'm sorry.

726
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,840
I'm sorry.

727
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,840
I'm sorry.

728
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,840
I'm sorry.

729
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:58,840
I'm sorry.

730
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,840
I'm sorry.

731
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,840
I'm sorry.

732
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:04,840
I'm sorry.

733
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,840
I'm sorry.

734
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,840
I'm sorry.

735
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:10,840
I'm sorry.

736
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:12,840
I'm sorry.

737
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,840
I'm sorry.

738
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,840
I'm sorry.

739
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:18,840
I'm sorry.

740
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:20,840
I'm sorry.

741
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,840
I'm sorry.

742
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,840
I'm sorry.

743
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,840
I'm sorry.

744
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,840
I'm sorry.

745
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:30,840
I'm sorry.

746
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,840
I'm sorry.

747
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,840
I'm sorry.

748
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,840
I'm sorry.

749
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,840
I'm sorry.

750
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:40,840
I'm sorry.

751
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,840
I'm sorry.

752
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:44,840
I'm sorry.

753
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:46,840
I'm sorry.

754
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:48,840
I'm sorry.

755
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,840
I'm sorry.

756
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:52,840
