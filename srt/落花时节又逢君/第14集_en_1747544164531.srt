1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Only I am drunk

2
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
The you in the painting

3
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
is waiting for the flowers to bloom

4
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
The Long Ballad

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Episode 16

6
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
This way, this way.

7
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
How is it?

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
It's fine.

9
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
What is Jian Xue going to do?

10
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
To be honest,

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I'm just testing if you have a spirit root.

12
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Spirit root?

13
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You don't even know what a spirit root is, do you?

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Spirit...

15
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Ordinary people don't have the ability to cultivate themselves,

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
unless you have a spirit root.

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
What do you mean?

18
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You mean,

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
if I'm tested and I don't have a spirit root,

20
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
can I not pass the election?

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Of course.

22
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
There are thousands of people who can have a spirit root.

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
A few people can have a spirit root.

24
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
There's no way to win.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
No, but the spirit root object I just walked by,

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,000
does it mean that I have a spirit root?

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
That's not necessarily.

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Many powerful cultivators have very weak spirits.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But in this warehouse,

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
it's hard to wake up.

31
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
How many types of spirits do you have?

32
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Normally,

33
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
there are five types of spirits.

34
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The strongest and the weakest spirit is the earth spirit root.

35
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I don't care.

36
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
As long as I can stay and pass the election,

37
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I can have any kind of spirit root.

38
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
We know each other by fate.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We know each other by fate.

40
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
If I become a fairy,

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
you can come and worship me.

42
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'll take care of you.

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Thank you.

44
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You're so confident.

45
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Of course.

46
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I know if everyone has a spirit root.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Just like me,

48
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I have a fire-like spirit root.

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
How do you know?

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It doesn't hurt.

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
It's just a little trick.

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm born to be a cultivation seed.

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I can only find the lemon tree

54
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
by staying here.

55
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
I must work hard.

56
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Uncle Wenxin is here.

57
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Uncle.

58
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
The lemon tree.

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
The lemon tree.

60
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I know if I can pass the election.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I hope you can be a fairy

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
no matter what.

63
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
It's him.

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
The lemon tree is here.

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Please come in.

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Fuling Jun.

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Fuling Jun of Ganzhou.

68
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Please.

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Please.

70
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm the first one.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I'm Fuling Jun of Ganzhou.

72
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I've been a fan of the immortal

73
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
for a long time.

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
As you know,

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Fuling Jun is a must-have place

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
for immortals.

77
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
There are many fairy tales.

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I've been a fan of the fire-like spirit root since I was a child.

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Please.

80
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Congratulations.

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
You have the earth spirit root.

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
You can continue to cultivate yourself in Cangwu.

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Earth...

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Earth spirit root?

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
How is that possible?

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I...

87
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
I could have extinguished the fire with my hands.

88
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
How could it be earth spirit root?

89
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You're thinking too much.

90
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's just a piece of flesh.

91
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's not a piece of flesh.

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's just a piece of flesh.

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's just a piece of flesh.

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
It's just a piece of flesh.

95
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's just a piece of flesh.

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's just a piece of flesh.

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Next.

98
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Next.

99
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Next.

100
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,800
The

101
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,000
Qinghai.

102
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
The sea of Cangwu.

103
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Why is it earth spirit root?

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Wenxin, you're right.

105
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I've been cultivating in Cangwu for 20 years.

106
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I hope I can pass the Cangwu

107
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
and learn the immortal arts.

108
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I hope I can learn more from you.

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Please.

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Please go back.

111
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Why?

112
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I can't possibly have no spirit root.

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Although you have a deep cultivation,

114
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
it doesn't mean you have spirit root.

115
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Impossible.

116
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I've been cultivating in the short-leaved mountain since I was a child.

117
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
How could I possibly not have any spirit root?

118
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
The spirit arrow didn't have any reaction.

119
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Please go back.

120
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The spirit arrow didn't have any reaction.

121
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Why didn't the spirit arrow make a mistake?

122
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I was just thinking.

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I was just thinking.

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Why didn't the spirit arrow make a mistake?

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I've come a long way to seek the immortal.

126
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Please let me face the sword and help you solve this.

127
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I'm fully responsible for the sword selection.

128
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Xianyou, please leave.

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I didn't expect Cangwu to gather me outside

130
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
with a simple and ordinary peach tree sword.

131
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
How could I have a single sword

132
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
in such a tall forest?

133
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I must see the real one today.

134
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
What's wrong?

135
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You're embarrassed, aren't you?

136
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I said it's useless to tell you.

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
But you insisted on doing it.

138
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
You don't even understand.

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Why are you still so angry?

140
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Bailing, don't be rude.

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Master, he's the one who's rude.

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Master.

143
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Greetings, Master.

144
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Zhiquan.

145
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Yes.

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Master.

148
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Mr. Cang Hai.

149
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm Cang Hai from the short-legged mountain.

150
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
I've met the master.

151
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I was just offended.

152
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I was just in a hurry.

153
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Please forgive me.

154
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
It's serious.

155
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
It's my disciple Cang Wu who's naughty.

156
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Please don't mind.

157
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I didn't expect Cang Wu

158
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
to have such a pure skill of jade.

159
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
No wonder the sword

160
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
can't feel my spirit.

161
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Today, I've learned a lot.

162
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll see you again when I'm disturbed.

163
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Bailing, after the sword selection,

164
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
go to the back hill to plant more ten-year trees.

165
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Yes.

166
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Is it over?

167
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Master, there's still Hongning.

168
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Go on.

169
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Hongning.

170
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Master, I'm Wang Hongning from Wang Village.

171
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Let's start.

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Why does this little guy look familiar?

173
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It seems that...

174
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Wait.

175
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I'm not ready yet.

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
One more time.

177
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
After the sword selection,

178
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I don't have any wish to be a fairy.

179
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
It's just that my good friend

180
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
is not here now.

181
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I'm afraid that

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
she might not be able to come back.

183
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I'll go to the back hill to plant more trees.

184
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm still trapped in this library.

185
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
After the sword selection,

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I'm the only one who can stay

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
and find her.

188
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Mr. Sword, I'm begging you.

189
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Even if you give me a soil spirit root.

190
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Hongning, you do have a spirit root.

191
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I...

192
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Mr. Sword, Mr. Sword,

193
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
do you have a friend?

194
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
My friend was caught because of me.

195
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I'm really worried about her.

196
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm begging you.

197
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Give me a spirit root.

198
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Let's end it.

199
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
Guards,

200
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,000
take Hongning away.

201
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Wait.

202
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Wait.

203
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Let me try again after I lose.

204
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
You won't win.

205
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It's lit. It's lit.

206
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Look. It's lit.

207
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Mr. Sword, look.

208
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
It's lit.

209
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,440
I've never seen a spirit sword

210
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,680
release purple light.

211
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,720
Master, look.

212
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,520
It's bright.

213
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,600
Can I stay?

214
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,800
No.

215
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,040
Why?

216
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,720
You're not a man.

217
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,520
You said

218
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,720
as long as the spirit sword is bright,

219
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,800
I can stay.

220
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,400
Spirit sword is used to test the spirit root.

221
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,400
But I've never seen

222
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,120
a spirit sword that releases purple light.

223
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,480
Then...

224
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,480
Then it doesn't belong to it and it's bright.

225
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,120
That's because you haven't seen it.

226
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,280
It's not the spirit sword.

227
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I've never seen it.

228
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,000
Rules are rules.

229
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,160
You can go.

230
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,160
I...

231
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,320
Master, something bad happened.

232
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,240
Something happened in the dungeon.

233
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:21,880
What happened?

234
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,680
The monsters in the dungeon

235
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,680
were so excited

236
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,760
that they kept talking about the Demon King.

237
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,680
I felt something was wrong.

238
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,920
So I came to report to you.

239
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
Demon King?

240
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,000
Tian Nanxin,

241
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
calm them down.

242
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,000
Others, follow me.

243
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,800
Yes.

244
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,600
I...

245
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,000
Is there a demon called

246
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,240
Ning Mengjing in your dungeon?

247
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,800
Ning Mengjing?

248
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,400
Yes.

249
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,400
You know it?

250
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,200
Guards!

251
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,200
No.

252
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,520
No.

253
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,800
What do you mean?

254
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,200
Tie you up.

255
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,400
So you won't run around.

256
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,200
Stay here.

257
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,800
Wait. Wait. Wait.

258
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,400
Come back. Come back.

259
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,400
I don't know how to tie you up.

260
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,600
Ning Mengjing?

261
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,400
Demon King!

262
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,400
Demon King!

263
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
Demon King!

264
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,800
Demon King is back!

265
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,400
Demon King is back!

266
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,800
Demon King is back!

267
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,400
Demon King is back!

268
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Demon King is back!

269
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,200
Master.

270
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,000
I don't know what's wrong

271
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,200
with the monsters in the dungeon.

272
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,400
They're going crazy.

273
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Give me the Demon King!

274
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,600
Demon King!

275
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,400
Demon King?

276
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,000
I want the Demon King!

277
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,800
Cang Wushan is the son of the Immortal Family.

278
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,800
Who wants the Demon King?

279
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
Demon King!

280
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,000
Demon King!

281
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,000
Demon King is back!

282
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
You will lead the three realms!

283
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I want the Demon King!

284
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,400
Friend.

285
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,600
Friend. Friend.

286
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,200
What happened?

287
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,600
It seems that there are monsters

288
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,800
making trouble in the dungeon.

289
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,200
Monsters?

290
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,000
What kind of monsters?

291
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,400
Is he yellow?

292
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,600
Yellow?

293
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,200
When did you come to care about color?

294
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,000
The Abyss Master told us

295
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,400
to take this place to avoid disaster.

296
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,000
Well.

297
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,800
Untie it for me.

298
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,800
I'm going to the dungeon.

299
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,000
Why are you going?

300
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,800
The monsters in there

301
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,600
may not even defeat the Taoist priest Wenxin.

302
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,600
Didn't you say

303
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,400
that the Abyss Master should have the soul of the Abyss Master?

304
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,600
Now the dungeon is in trouble.

305
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,000
If we don't go,

306
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
what's the point of us

307
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
practicing together?

308
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,600
I didn't expect

309
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,400
you to be so bold.

310
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,200
Okay.

311
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
I'll go with you.

312
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,600
No. Come back.

313
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,600
Untie it.

314
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Right. Sorry.

315
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,200
Let's make it clear.

316
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
If I'm expelled,

317
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
you must protect me.

318
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,000
Got it.

319
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,400
Wait for me.

320
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,200
How dare you, Scorpion Spirit!

321
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,200
I even spared your inner beast.

322
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,600
I didn't expect you to be so merciless.

323
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,200
You ruined my thousand-year cultivation,

324
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,800
hurt my clan,

325
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,200
and destroyed my thoughts.

326
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,200
You trapped me in this dark world

327
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,800
and made me suffer.

328
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,200
Is this how you repay me?

329
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,600
I'm a monster.

330
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,200
I'm doing this for the heaven.

331
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,400
If you hadn't hurt the innocent,

332
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,000
you wouldn't have ended up like this.

333
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,800
I'm not in the mood to talk to you today.

334
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,200
If you want to get rid of the monster,

335
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,600
I'll leave.

336
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,200
Spirit Beast,

337
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,600
you were born a monster.

338
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You're a member of the Ji Ming clan.

339
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,200
Aren't you afraid of being ridiculed

340
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,000
if you kill me?

341
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I think you're still talking nonsense.

342
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,200
You're really funny.

343
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,600
You're doing evil things for your own good.

344
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,600
Who's the one who's losing face?

345
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,200
I'll take your internal order today.

346
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,400
Today,

347
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,200
I'll show you

348
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,600
what the heaven is like for Scorpion Spirit.

349
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,800
Who's that monster?

350
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,000
Scorpion Spirit of Ganzhou?

351
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,600
He once protected a sect.

352
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Master took him in.

353
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,800
I guess he's here to seek revenge today.

354
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,600
It's hard to find him.

355
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
Yeah, it's really hard.

356
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,400
Now is a good chance to find the Spirit of Lemon.

357
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,000
But there are so many monsters here.

358
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,400
How can I find them?

359
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,400
Help me keep an eye on Master.

360
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Where are you going?

361
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
Lemon King.

362
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Lemon King.

363
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,600
Lemon King.

364
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,200
Lemon King.

365
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,400
Lemon King.

366
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,600
Go and get some other medicine.

367
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:22,600
I'll take care of this.

368
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:23,400
Yes.

369
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Go.

370
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,000
Watch out!

371
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,800
Are you okay?

372
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,800
Scorpion Spirit.

373
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,800
I saved your life

374
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,200
because you were so lucky.

375
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,800
Today,

376
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,400
I won't give you another chance.

377
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,000
Take them to the dungeon.

378
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,000
Yes.

379
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
Bai Ling.

380
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,200
Yes.

381
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,600
Take her down the mountain.

382
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:32,800
Yes.

383
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,600
Let's go.

384
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,200
Master,

385
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,800
why is she fainted?

386
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:32,580
The

387
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,800
Every time I get close to you,

388
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,600
you'll get hurt.

389
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,000
After so much,

390
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,400
you still haven't changed.

391
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,000
How dare you, Xiao Hong Chao.

392
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:58,600
Once upon a time in Xu acupoints

393
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,800
Lord Tong,

394
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,800
who do you want to kill?

395
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,000
Don't kill the organizes.

396
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,200
Master.

397
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,000
Don't drive me away.

398
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I want to be with you forever

399
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Let's get drunk

400
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,000
The name in the painting

401
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:45,000
is just like a memory in the painting

402
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Master, I've asked them all

403
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Those demons are being bewitched by the Scorpion Spirit

404
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
They want to open the gate of the dungeon

405
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
in my Cangwu Sword Pavilion

406
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
These demons are not good at coming

407
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
They are not impulsive

408
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
They even said

409
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
they would release the Demon King

410
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
The Demon King was killed by Zhong Tian

411
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
ten thousand years ago

412
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
It's probably being bewitched

413
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
But

414
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Forget it

415
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
Let the judge make the judgement

416
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
and let the judge deal with them

417
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
Master

418
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
You're back so late

419
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Where have you been?

420
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
I

421
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I went to the village down there

422
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
to help the demons

423
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Then the village chief

424
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
wanted me to be his son-in-law

425
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
He didn't let me go

426
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I finally escaped

427
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
The more you make it worse

428
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I saw you lost 200 years of spirit power

429
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You can't stop those demons

430
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
Did you go to fight against them?

431
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
Master

432
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
You know Bai Ling the best

433
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
Although he's a little arrogant and domineering

434
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,000
he's kind and simple

435
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Kind and simple?

436
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You're a master

437
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You should be more disciplined

438
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Yes, master

439
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
By the way

440
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
The disciple in the dungeon

441
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
took him to the mountain

442
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
and sent him down the mountain

443
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Master, someone just saved me

444
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
I hope you can give him a chance

445
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
No need to say more

446
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Take him to the mountain

447
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
and reward him

448
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
and send him down the mountain

449
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
Yes, master

450
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Junior

451
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
What are you doing?

452
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
You're so sneaky

453
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Senior, you scared me

454
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I just went in

455
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
to get some medicine

456
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
Are you okay?

457
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Are you hurt again?

458
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
How could I get hurt?

459
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
Who can hurt me?

460
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
Really?

461
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
You touched all the medicine in the warehouse

462
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
So many

463
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
You

464
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
By the way, Senior

465
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
When will Senior Fox come back?

466
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
I've sent a message to him

467
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
He might come back at any time

468
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
At any time?

469
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
You won't offend Senior Fox again, will you?

470
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
How could I?

471
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
We're so close

472
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
Are you serious?

473
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
If you two fight

474
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
call me to watch the fun

475
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Go

476
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
Go

477
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,000
Go

478
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
You want to get out of here?

479
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
Who are you looking down on?

480
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
Aren't you going to take me to the dungeon?

481
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Why do you take me here?

482
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I don't want to see you

483
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
There are many guests in the dungeon

484
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'll close my eyes if you don't want to see me

485
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I don't want to see you

486
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
You don't want to see me

487
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
But you don't want to see me

488
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
So you're not going to see me

489
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I want to see you

490
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Go

491
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Go

492
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Go

493
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I'll kill all of you

494
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Go

495
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Go

496
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
Go

497
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Go

498
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Go

499
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,840
Give me your hand

500
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,560
What do you want

501
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,880
What else can I do

502
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:55,960
The poison give you

503
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:08,520
Make you 영상을

504
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:10,720
Niu

505
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:11,760
It is not painful

506
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,220
I'm here for you

507
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,080
You

508
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,500
Wait for me

509
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,160
No

510
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,600
It hurts?

511
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:50,500
Look at yours

512
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,280
It's none of your business.

513
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,520
Let me go.

514
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,680
Go?

515
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,840
Listen,

516
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,120
just stay here.

517
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,120
The person with the worst temper

518
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,280
will be back soon.

519
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,000
Or else, if you meet him,

520
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,080
he'll swallow you alive.

521
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:12,560
I'm afraid...

522
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,600
Instead of being tortured here,

523
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,160
it's better to be swallowed alive.

524
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,400
You're so brave.

525
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,040
Since you're willing to die,

526
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
why did you avoid

527
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,200
the chase of the Heavenly Soldiers?

528
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,200
I...

529
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,320
The blood is still outside.

530
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,000
The immortal sword is still clinging to me.

531
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,280
I have to live.

532
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,000
What?

533
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,840
You're hurt by what I said?

534
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,120
If you ask me,

535
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,760
you can just rest here and recuperate.

536
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,080
If you want to be more open-minded,

537
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,840
if you really commit suicide,

538
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:52,580
I'll make you a

539
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:52,600
You...

540
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,280
You...

541
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,240
What are you doing?

542
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,280
Are you hungry?

543
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
I'll find you something to eat.

544
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,440
I'm hungry.

545
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,240
Go now.

546
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,280
Okay.

547
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,000
This is not right.

548
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,960
You're treating me as your servant,

549
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,000
aren't you?

550
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,920
Or else?

551
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,200
I've never seen you like this.

552
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,000
Go now.

553
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,120
Okay.

554
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,280
Go.

555
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:18,840
Why are you laughing?

556
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,920
It's okay.

557
00:27:58,760 --> 00:27:59,480
Master,

558
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,940
he hasn't come to survival

559
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:01,920
until now after sleeping so late.

560
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,200
Has his injury just got worse?

561
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,920
What about my herb?

562
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,640
You don't have to.

563
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,200
Esteem did get much worse.

564
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:06,800
Master.

565
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,400
But he hasn't come to his senses

566
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,200
for such a long time.

567
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,320
Or else I'll set him up.

568
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:12,360
You can never wake someone up

569
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,360
disguised himself as asleep.

570
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,640
Then what should we do?

571
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,200
I'll just wait.

572
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,500
No wonder.

573
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,660
Seriously.

574
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,680
Forget it.

575
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,180
Jelly and grapes

576
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,000
will take care of tässäèèè'èè.

577
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,100
Crazy.

578
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,500
It's because,

579
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:36,920
I can see you as a passerby sequ rake.

580
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,680
What he want is fake.

581
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,500
From now onwards,

582
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,920
there's no way for two lovers to meet.

583
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,080
It's impossible.

584
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,560
All these three monsters,

585
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,500
I union were attacked.

586
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:54,800
Liu Wenjing,

587
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,360
I joined them.

588
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:03,420
No wonder my parents forbade me to come to Cangmu Mountain.

589
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,880
This catalyn is too sexy for me.

590
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,300
Liu Wenjing assured all were caught by them.

591
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,720
Could I...

592
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:49,880
Tasty.

593
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,560
You'd think barbies a joke?

594
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,240
New petites maak?

595
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,520
Come with me.

596
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,840
I'll be right back.

597
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,080
Just kidding.

598
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,160
If he can't make a joke,

599
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,880
he is the backup.

600
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,920
Notice that?

601
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,360
I'll go talk to him.

602
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,440
Now it's our favor.

603
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,360
Young Master?!

604
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:18,240
Young?!

605
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,200
Poor thing.

606
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,400
How can we find the lemon tree?

607
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,520
How about

608
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:01,160
asking that cruel master?

609
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:02,640
No.

610
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,320
He's so fierce.

611
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,080
What if he shaves off the lemon tree?

612
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,880
I have to find it myself.

613
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,160
Little Bro.

614
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,280
Little Bro.

615
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,080
Little Bro.

616
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:20,160
You're awake.

617
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,240
I'm awake.

618
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,000
What's wrong, Little Bro?

619
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:23,880
Nothing.

620
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,040
You saved me.

621
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,440
So I came to say thanks to you.

622
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,480
It's what I should do.

623
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,120
It's not fair.

624
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,920
There's another thing.

625
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:38,840
I want to ask you.

626
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,520
Have we met before?

627
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,560
How is that possible?

628
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,440
You got the wrong person.

629
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,040
I mainly

630
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,440
have a big face.

631
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:52,760
It's not that special.

632
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,480
Really?

633
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,000
But I always feel...

634
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:57,680
Little Bro.

635
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,840
I have something to ask you.

636
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,440
Did you catch back a

637
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,000
monster recently?

638
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,280
How did he know I brought a little fox back?

639
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,280
Did you catch back

640
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,520
a ancient dragon?

641
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,920
Where's Mao Rou Rou?

642
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,320
Bullshit!

643
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,520
Don't talk nonsense.

644
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,520
I'm warning you.

645
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,040
Don't talk nonsense.

646
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,400
Cang Wu Yuan is scarier than you think.

647
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,360
If you say a word,

648
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,920
you might be killed.

649
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:27,800
Do you hear me?

650
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,400
Shut up!

651
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:31,680
Shut up!

652
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,640
Little Bro, don't be angry.

653
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,120
I just said it casually.

654
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,240
It's okay.

655
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,240
Look.

656
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,680
I've been awake for a long time.

657
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,680
I'm a little dizzy.

658
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,160
I'll take a rest.

659
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:42,920
Wait.

660
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,200
Do you like my candy?

661
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,720
She must have caught it.

662
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,320
I need to

663
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,640
think a lot about this.

664
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,440
This guy must want to know my secret.

665
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,440
He's a bomb that can explode at any time.

666
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,440
No.

667
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,440
I have to think of a way to stop him from staying in the garden.

668
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,440
You're awake.

669
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,440
Master.

670
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,440
You're still in good shape.

671
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,440
I'm fine.

672
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,440
No, I'm just stuck.

673
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,440
Put on your clothes. I'll take you down the mountain.

674
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,440
I'm fine.

675
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,440
I'm fine.

676
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:17,440
I suddenly feel a little dizzy.

677
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,440
I still have some mental problems.

678
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,440
I feel bad.

679
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,440
I...

680
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,440
I just suddenly have a little heart attack.

681
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,440
You have mental problems?

682
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,440
You know a lot about medical science.

683
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,440
I'm not a doctor.

684
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,440
I'm a doctor.

685
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,440
I'm a doctor.

686
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,440
You have mental problems?

687
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,440
You know medical science?

688
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,440
I know a little.

689
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,440
Then, please help me look at it.

690
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,440
Master, what's wrong with you?

691
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,440
I have mental problems. Don't think too much.

692
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,440
Rest well. I'll take you down the mountain.

693
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,440
I'm not going down.

694
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:17,440
Tell me the truth.

695
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,440
Why did you come to Cangwu?

696
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,440
To cultivate the deity.

697
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:20,440
How could you cultivate the deity?

698
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,440
How could I not cultivate the deity?

699
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,440
You're not me. How do you know?

700
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,440
I know.

701
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,440
You didn't pass the test.

702
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,440
You can't stay in Cangwu.

703
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,440
As a master,

704
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,440
why don't you know your debt?

705
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,440
I saved your disciple.

706
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,440
I was seriously injured.

707
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,440
You're pretending.

708
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,440
I'm not.

709
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
Look.

710
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:51,440
Hongning.

711
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,440
I can't see you're so hidden.

712
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,440
You're brave and cunning.

713
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,440
I'm flattered.

714
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,440
In our school,

715
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,440
there are many talented people.

716
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,440
Even if you're in the hospital,

717
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,440
you may not be able to cultivate what you want.

718
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,440
You're the elites of our school.

719
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,440
You newbies

720
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:12,440
should pay attention to your behavior.

721
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,440
Our school has a well-known rule.

722
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,440
Don't talk too much.

723
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,440
Be more honest.

724
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,440
Do you understand?

725
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,440
Yes.

726
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,440
How many do you want?

727
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,440
I'll give you a discount.

728
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,440
How many do you want?

729
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,440
I'll give you a discount.

730
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,440
I'll give you a discount.

731
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,440
How many do you want?

732
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:36,440
I'll give you a discount.

733
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,440
This is a dress.

734
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,440
I'll give you a discount.

735
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,440
Why?

736
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
How can you give me a discount?

737
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,440
I'll give you a discount.

738
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,440
What are you doing?

739
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,440
You're so arrogant.

740
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,440
How dare you?

741
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,440
Everyone.

742
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,440
Clean up the dorms.

743
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:52,440
Dress up.

744
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,440
If I see you again,

745
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:54,440
I'll make you dirty.

746
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:56,440
Get out of the warehouse.

747
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,440
Yes.

748
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:02,440
You too.

749
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,440
Get out.

750
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,440
Me?

751
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,440
Didn't you say

752
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:12,440
the rules are strict here?

753
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,440
That's because

754
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,440
this is a repair shop.

755
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,440
Go.

756
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,440
I...

757
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,440
I'll go.

758
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,440
Wait.

759
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,440
Why do I feel

760
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,440
we really met

761
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,440
at the repair shop?

762
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,440
Where is it?

763
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,440
How is that possible?

764
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:40,440
This is the first time

765
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,440
I left home since I was a kid.

766
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:43,440
Think about it.

767
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,440
If I had met you before,

768
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,440
you were so handsome

769
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,440
and you were so talented,

770
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,440
how could I have come to Cangwu Mountain

771
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,440
now?

772
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,440
I would have come earlier.

773
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,440
That's true.

774
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,440
It's not bad to know each other now.

775
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,440
Go.

776
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,440
Go inside and have a rest.

777
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,440
I'm here.

778
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,440
Where is the class?

779
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,440
How can I practice?

780
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,440
I need to learn.

781
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,440
Master,

782
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:12,440
how about you teach me how to practice?

783
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,440
Practice?

784
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,440
As long as I learn

785
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,440
how to practice in Cangwu Mountain,

786
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,440
I can find a way to stay.

787
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,440
As long as he doesn't know the foundation,

788
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,440
I can drive him away.

789
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,440
Let me introduce again.

790
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:28,440
My name is Bai Ling.

791
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,440
I'm the youngest

792
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,440
and most talented student

793
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,440
in Cangwu Mountain.

794
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,440
From now on,

795
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,440
I'll lead you two to practice.

796
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,440
Yes, Senior Bai Ling.

797
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:46,440
Do you understand?

798
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,440
Yes, I do.

799
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,440
Thank you, Senior Bai Ling.

800
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,440
Listen,

801
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,440
practice is from the inside out,

802
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,440
and from the outside out,

803
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,440
from the bottom up.

804
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,440
If you don't have a stable foundation,

805
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,440
no matter how talented you are,

806
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,440
you can't achieve anything.

807
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,440
Besides,

808
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,440
there are many talented people

809
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,440
in Cangwu Mountain.

810
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,440
For example,

811
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,440
for example, me.

812
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,440
I've been praised since I was a kid.

813
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:16,440
Have I ever shown off in front of you?

814
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,440
I didn't...

815
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,440
Well, Senior Bai Ling,

816
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:21,440
let's talk about the weapon.

817
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,440
It's the practice.

818
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,440
Practice.

819
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,440
The so-called practice

820
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,440
is divided into three weapons.

821
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,440
The first one is the essence weapon.

822
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,440
It's so big.

823
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,440
The second one is the essence weapon.

824
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,440
Where can we find the essence weapon?

825
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,440
The third one is the one we need to practice.

826
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,440
It's called the spirit weapon.

827
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,440
It's the spirit and the essence weapon

828
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,440
that can make the spirit of mountains and rivers

829
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,440
be ingrained in your whole body.

830
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,440
Master.

831
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:51,440
Master.

832
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,440
Master, why are you here?

833
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,440
I've been closed for days.

834
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,440
I didn't come to ask them to have a rest.

835
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,440
I'm free today.

836
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
So I came to have a look.

837
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,440
Where's Hong Ning?

838
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,440
She...

839
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,440
Hong Ning?

840
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,440
Senior Bai Ling is teaching her the practice outside.

841
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:12,440
Practice?

842
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,440
Bai Ling?

843
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,440
Wipe your eyes and look here.

844
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:29,440
Use our spirit weapon to control her.

845
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,440
You've learned enough.

846
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,440
It's time to eat.

847
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,440
Food?

848
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,440
Little fox.

849
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,440
I have something to do.

850
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,440
I'll go first.

851
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,440
You haven't finished teaching.

852
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,440
This is the practice.

853
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,440
You're so mean.

854
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,440
You're so mean.

855
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,440
I...

856
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,440
How can I be mean?

857
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,440
Did you get it?

858
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,440
I think I got it a little.

859
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,440
What's this?

860
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,440
This.

861
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,440
This is my investigation of Cangwu Academy.

862
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:08,440
Investigation?

863
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,440
Tell me about it.

864
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,440
This Senior Bai Ling

865
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,440
is the old demon in Cangwu Academy.

866
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:19,440
He's also a soldier.

867
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,440
The second-ranked Tian Nan Xing

868
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,440
is a tough character.

869
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,440
The main character is our senior.

870
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,440
Right.

871
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,440
There's also a senior

872
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,440
we haven't seen before.

873
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,440
His name is Lu Jiu.

874
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,440
It's said that he's the master's admirer.

875
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,440
He listens to the master.

876
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,440
What about the master?

877
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:41,440
The master is the head of Cangwu Academy.

878
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,440
He's the famous Jin Xiu.

879
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,440
Jin Xiu?

880
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,440
He was born in the sky a hundred years ago.

881
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,440
He's the master of the messy Cangwu Academy.

882
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,440
He's known land and etc.

883
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,440
He graced Cangwu for internal stability.

884
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,440
During these hundred years,

885
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,680
the evil demon

886
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:00,440
has been eradicated.

887
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,440
However,

888
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,440
I don't know if he's organized attack in his cultivation.

889
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,440
He's 숨 conflicts and practices every time.

890
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,440
How do you know so much about cultivation?

891
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,440
I just got used to it.

892
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,440
Before I came to Cangwu Academy,

893
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,600
Before I went to college,

894
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:24,440
I was a

895
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,800
It seems that I have to find the lemon tree

896
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,560
I have to start from this devil

897
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,040
exactly

898
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,440
Wei Puchi

899
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,240
I seem to have often saya

900
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,760
I seem to have also comprehended a little

901
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,160
What did you understand

902
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:08,680
Misunderstood

903
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:13,980
erhö

904
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:16,720
trembling

905
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,720
I'm here to help you.

906
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,720
Why are you here?

907
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,200
Are you feeling better?

908
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:22,960
No.

909
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,640
But Senior Bai Ling said

910
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,800
I can recover faster with my cultivation.

911
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:32,920
Remember.

912
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,760
The core of all magic

913
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,480
is concentration.

914
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,040
Concentrate and focus.

915
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:44,820
From Giant Choke Purge Pose

916
00:43:45,920 --> 00:44:01,440
Feel the spiritual power

917
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,840
from deep inside?

918
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:04,680
Tell me.

919
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:06,000
What do you see?

920
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,560
I saw

921
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,320
a darkness.

922
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:12,040
I'm the teacher.

923
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:25,040
Didn't I tell you to focus on the work?

924
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,640
Why did you become the peony?

925
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:29,840
Because I'm thinking about you.

926
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,720
Nonsense.

927
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:38,960
She's angry.

928
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:40,720
No.

929
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,120
I can't let her stay here.

930
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,400
Master.

931
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,280
What master?

932
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:45,120
Look after Hong Ning.

933
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:46,040
Don't let her wander around.

934
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,080
Don't wander around?

935
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:49,680
Well.

936
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:51,200
Still like this?

937
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:52,800
Oh my god.

938
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,160
Don't wander around.

939
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:17,600
The flowers are blooming, and the heart is full of love.

940
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:24,160
I'll accompany you to the end of the world to enjoy the wind and rain.

941
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,440
Please change your name for a lifetime.

942
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:36,160
I still remember that day, I was happy.

943
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:43,160
The flowers are blooming, and the heart is full of love.

944
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:49,960
I'll accompany you to the end of the world to enjoy the wind and rain.

945
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:56,360
I wish to chase after the love with all my heart.

946
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:02,760
I can't let you go.

947
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:09,360
I still remember that day, I was happy.

948
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:17,360
The flowers are blooming, and the heart is full of love.
