REVELATIONS

15
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,774
Hello, sir.
Glad you came.

16
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,735
-Let's go get something to eat.
-Sure.

17
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,281
-That man followed you?
-Don't look at him. Don't look.

18
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,868
You're popular, A-yeong.
That old guy followed you? Huh?

19
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,162
Want me to kill you? Shut up.

20
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,539
It's much better now. Yeah.

21
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,417
Oh, right, I see.

22
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,086
Sorry, excuse me.

23
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,796
Hello there.

24
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:38,092
Ah, you haven't come to visit us before.

25
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:42,138
I'd like to introduce myself.
I'm Pastor Sung Min-chan.

26
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,267
I was just, uh, passing by
and saw this church…

27
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,186
Ah.

28
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,981
Would you like some coffee?
I'll get it started.

29
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,650
I'm busy.

30
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,736
I need to get going.

31
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:57,820
Wait.

32
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,366
One cup won't take long.

33
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:12,585
-I swear he followed me.
-You're imagining things again.

34
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:15,255
-Sorry about that.
-Sorry, ma'am.

35
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,263
Oh. Are you okay?

36
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,475
Uh, are you feeling sick?
Do you want me to call 911?

37
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,937
I'm okay. Don't worry.

38
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:38,027
Let's go.

39
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,132
-Okay, bye.
-Bye. See you next week.

40
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,345
Watch your step, it's slippery. Slow down.

41
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:06,764
I think
the large will fit you well.

42
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:11,561
You stopped by on a whim,
but I hope you join us here again.

43
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,190
Do you live in the area?

44
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:17,692
Yeah, kinda.

45
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:19,360
Then we'd love to have you.

46
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,362
It would be great if you became a regular.

47
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:24,991
Are you a churchgoer?

48
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:29,579
Yeah, somewhat. A long time ago, as a kid.

49
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,165
Oh. That happens a lot.

50
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,917
People who attend church regularly
when they are young

51
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:37,670
can drift away as they grow up.

52
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,381
Only to return to God eventually.

53
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,301
In that process, you receive revelations

54
00:05:43,384 --> 00:05:46,012
and you come to accept
God's place in your life.

55
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:47,513
Oh, right.

56
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,517
I just realized that
I forgot to ask what your name was.

57
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,810
What is your name?

58
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:58,107
Kwon Yang-rae.

59
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,069
Kwon Yang-rae.

60
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,653
What's that for?

61
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,491
This is just…

62
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,493
REGISTRATION FORM

63
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:13,039
This… This is for new member registration.

64
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,791
We never used to

65
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,543
need to get all this information before,

66
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,588
but everything's become digitized
these days,

67
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,674
so the manual forms come in handy
from time to time.

68
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:27,762
We're a… We're a church plant,
and I'm embarrassed to say…

69
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,973
-…I'm not used to this.
-Look.

70
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:36,062
Like I said, I was just in the area.

71
00:06:39,774 --> 00:06:42,693
This isn't some complicated form.
It's just, uh…

72
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,488
It's easy and simple to fill out.

73
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,907
Name and phone number
so we can contact you.

74
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,867
Yeah, it's not much.

75
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:53,079
What else? Right. One second.

76
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:59,585
A photo would certainly help us out
as well.

77
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:05,383
This is great. I'll print it right now
and once it prints, I'll delete this.

78
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:11,722
See? Look. Your photo's been deleted.

79
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,685
Oh, no. Um…

80
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,188
Excuse me, sir,
I have to make an urgent call.

81
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,440
I'll be right back.

82
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,777
Yeah, so this, it's just a simple form,
so if you could please fill it out.

83
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,280
I'll only be gone for a moment.
I'll be right back.

84
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,767
Hey, Mr. Sung.

85
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:58,936
Yes, what's going on?

86
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,605
Well, your hunch was right.

87
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:04,650
I think your wife's been seeing
her personal trainer for quite some time.

88
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,487
They meet about three times a week.

89
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,572
I'll send you some photos now.
Take a look.

90
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:12,450
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate it.

91
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,495
Not at all. You've been extremely helpful.

92
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,470
What do you think?
Should I collect more evidence?

93
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:37,517
It depends.
What do you mean by "more evidence"?

94
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,853
They meet pretty often,
so the next time they go into a motel,

95
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,273
I can take pictures and videos
of them making out, having sex,

96
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,443
and also look for stuff
like condoms or tissues with semen.

97
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,945
If they don't use condoms,

98
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,615
my boys can find and collect traces
of semen on your wife's body.

99
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:54,367
So no worries there.

100
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,745
So do you want me to try
to gather more evidence or not?

101
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,498
Hello? Mr. Sung?

102
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:16,138
Wait, sir, don't go yet.
We haven't had time to talk.

103
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,724
Um, I have business I need to get to.

104
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,227
I've filled out your form.

105
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,646
Where's my shoes?

106
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:25,481
These?

107
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:31,654
You shouldn't fold the back of your shoes.
You'll ruin them.

108
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,738
Here, put them on.

109
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:46,043
You are welcome.

110
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:52,008
Church is a place for sinners.

111
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,888
You're always welcomed here.
God loves us all.

112
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:23,581
A new member?

113
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,208
Did that man register?

114
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,212
Well… kind of.

115
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,633
Honey, aren't you gonna be late?

116
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:36,886
-Yeah. I'll meet you outside, all right?
-Sure.

117
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,972
What's up, Dad?

118
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:25,393
Now?

119
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:31,190
Nothing. I'll be home soon.

120
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,984
We can eat together.

121
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,133
Hey, honey,
just drop me off at the subway.

122
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,638
What reunion is this?

123
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,308
A college reunion.

124
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,602
Did you forget?

125
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,524
I might be home late.
You'll pick up Yeon-u, right?

126
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,782
Oh. Why do they have to work
on weekends too?

127
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,326
Never mind.

128
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,328
It's better
they finish this new building soon,

129
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:29,081
so we can get some more parishioners
in this area.

130
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,470
What is that?

131
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,264
Can you pull over here? Pull over.

132
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,488
HEAVENSFOLK CHURCH

133
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,615
Oh, my gosh.
They're building a new church here.

134
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,456
Hold on. It's Pastor Jung's church!

135
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,333
OWNER: JUNG GUK-HWAN

136
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,630
Wow! Maybe he'll ask you
to come be the pastor.

137
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,134
He brought you here
to grow that tiny church.

138
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,677
This must be his plan.

139
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:28,974
You picked up everybody that came
to his morning prayer service for years.

140
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,267
It's paying off.

141
00:13:32,102 --> 00:13:34,313
You should go pay him a visit today.

142
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,023
Right? Don't you think?

143
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,500
I'm home.

144
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:58,420
No construction site work today?
It stopped raining.

145
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:02,132
Yeah, it's supposed to rain a lot later,
so they sent us home.

146
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,718
The assistant manager'll wrap things up.

147
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,847
Come on. Time to eat.

148
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,141
What's all this?
You cooked up a feast.

149
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,477
Tomorrow's your first day on the new team.

150
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,770
You should eat some meat.

151
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,981
It's no big deal.

152
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,608
How's the construction? Almost done?

153
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,485
We'll remove the scaffolding in two days.

154
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,445
Nice. So it's almost done.

155
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:28,242
Anyway, you were on a good team,

156
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,578
but you picked a hard route
to a promotion.

157
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,331
Did you have to volunteer
to join the Violent Crimes Unit?

158
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,542
It's great.

159
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,170
I'm closer to home
and my commute was stressful.

160
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:47,845
Kwon Yang-rae, that shithead.
He's been released in this area.

161
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:50,639
Really?

162
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,476
You already knew that.

163
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,607
This tastes great.
Did you buy the yangnyeom sauce?

164
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,859
No, stop trying to change the subject.

165
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,572
Hey. You're not tailing him, are you?

166
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,077
Let it slide. Hmm?

167
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,830
Live your life and move on.

168
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,170
Show me the building
after the scaffolding comes off.

169
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,297
I'm curious what it'll look like.

170
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,841
Yeon-hui, you're all I have now,
you know that.

171
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,594
If something bad happens to you too…

172
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:39,813
You do the dishes.

173
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:53,494
SKY PEACE CHURCH

174
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:56,580
Come in.

175
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,794
Pastor.

176
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,713
Look who it is, hello.

177
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,882
Oh. Are you all right?

178
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:08,884
Sit down.

179
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,470
Make sure you take care of yourself.

180
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,764
You always work so hard.

181
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,725
No, I'm fine. It's not that bad.

182
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,938
I know you've been
working pretty hard yourself.

183
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,398
How's the church been doing?

184
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,400
I don't work as hard as you.

185
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,696
I did want to mention that,
just before I came,

186
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,532
I managed to register a new member.

187
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,911
Don't be so obsessed
with registering new members.

188
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,455
All right? Just remember that

189
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,541
you're a messenger of God,

190
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,210
spreading his good word
on this world's barren land.

191
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:46,255
That's all the purpose
we need to keep going.

192
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,509
I'll be sure to remember that.

193
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:55,431
I saw… Was it "Heavensfolk Church"?

194
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:56,974
-Hmm, you saw the poster.
-Yes.

195
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,104
I think… that my wife
was more surprised than I was.

196
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:06,191
Why didn't you mention it to me?

197
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,028
Sorry. I've been so scattered.

198
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:16,201
Who would you recommend for that church?

199
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,206
Recommend?

200
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,543
Yes, for the Heavensfolk Church.
I'm curious about who you'd recommend.

201
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:28,297
You've been in that area for a long time,
and I thought I should ask you.

202
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:32,843
Who do you think would be a good candidate
as the pastor in charge there? Huh?

203
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:38,140
Ah, hmm. As the pastor…

204
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,977
Is there anyone who comes to mind at all?

205
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,691
Not yet, um…

206
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,114
I'll get back to you
once I think about it a bit.

207
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:57,493
All right, sounds good.
Let's put our heads together.

208
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,541
God will reveal to us
the right person for the job.

209
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,798
Hurry. Hurry!
I told you to bring your umbrella.

210
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:13,467
Let's head inside.
Quick, so we don't get soaked.

211
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,261
Oh, Min-chan.

212
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,638
Oh, Hwan-su.

213
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,264
One minute.

214
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,143
Oh. Why'd you stop by? It's been a while.

215
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,063
Ah, I'm headed out.
I came to see Pastor Jung.

216
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,440
Ah, you came to see my father.

217
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:34,279
Oh. My dad's building a new church.
Did you know? It's in your neighborhood.

218
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:37,699
Uh, yeah, I mean… I've heard about it.

219
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:41,328
The church elders keep saying
they want me to lead that church,

220
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:42,746
but I'm under so much pressure.

221
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:47,501
Well, actually, during our meeting,

222
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:51,922
your, um, your father said
he was still looking for the right person

223
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,007
and asked for my opinion, so…

224
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,176
Why would he ask you for your opinion?

225
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:00,597
Why would he ask you that?
Why did my father ask for your opinion?

226
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:04,226
Ugh, he's out of his mind
and putting me in a tough spot.

227
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,896
No, you're obviously
the one who should do it.

228
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,982
You've been growing your church for years.

229
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:14,194
Let's be honest.
What do I know about leading a church?

230
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,488
I'm definitely underqualified.

231
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:20,993
Hey, I'll talk to my father for you.

232
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:22,744
No, it's all right. Don't bother.

233
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,582
You and I both know
that it's not our call.

234
00:19:27,082 --> 00:19:30,294
And our Almighty God
will show us the right person.

235
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,546
-We have to have faith.
-We're heading in now.

236
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:36,008
Hold on. I have to get going
but I'll call you. We'll talk again.

237
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:37,176
-Sure.
-You got this, okay?

238
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,677
-Oh, okay. Thanks.
-You got this!

239
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,512
-Have a good day.
-Sorry 'bout that. Let's go.

240
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,285
Dear Heavenly Father,
please watch over me,

241
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:07,497
so that my pure faith in you,
my Lord, who's carrying all my burdens,

242
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:11,418
is no longer shaken or swayed
by worldly temptations.

243
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,213
I ask that…

244
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:16,924
I ask that

245
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:21,220
if my leading the new church happens to be
in alignment with what you have planned,

246
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,474
I am available
and more than happy to abide.

247
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,436
Please enlighten us all, as we are--

248
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:39,780
WIFE
LEE SI-YEONG

249
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,036
-Hello?
-Honey, where are you?

250
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:48,080
Is Yeon-u with you?

251
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,250
Yeon-u? Why would he be with me?

252
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,795
I asked you to pick up Yeon-u
because I had my college reunion.

253
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,718
Right. Well, uh, I had something to do.

254
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,596
What did you have to do?
The service ended hours ago!

255
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,725
What are we going to do?
What do we do?

256
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:11,353
Calm down.
What did the daycare teacher say?

257
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:14,564
She said that some man came
and took Yeon-u!

258
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,694
I assumed it was you.

259
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:21,113
What do we do? What are we going to do?

260
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,699
Yeon-u's been kidnapped!

261
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,161
Honey, go to the daycare center

262
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,706
and ask the description
of the man who picked him up.

263
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:34,209
I swear, if Yeon-u is hurt,
it's all on you.

264
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:35,752
Do you hear me?

265
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,540
SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY

266
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,083
KWON YANG-RAE

267
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,087
9, 8-GIL, MYEONGHWA-RO, MUSAN CITY

268
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,601
Hey, Yeon-ju.

269
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,270
Are you still not talking to Dad?

270
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,023
You should really call him.

271
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,486
Mmm, okay, okay, I will.

272
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:45,155
Why do you sound like that?

273
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,199
Are you sick?

274
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:50,869
Yeon-ju?

275
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,954
It's not that.

276
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,290
I just woke up.

277
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,586
You just woke up?
Do you know what time it is?

278
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:03,006
You moved to the new place
so you could commute less and study more.

279
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,674
You are studying hard, right?

280
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,635
Yeah.

281
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,720
I'll call you later, okay?

282
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,057
All right. Call me if you need anything.

283
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,403
Yeon-hui.

284
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,118
Yeon-hui.

285
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:33,578
Do you remember?

286
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,833
Remember the day I moved
into my own apartment?

287
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:43,130
We said it was like a housewarming party…
and took this photo.

288
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:46,758
You look great in this picture.

289
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:52,848
But you know what?
I regret getting my own place.

290
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:10,073
Do you know what I kept telling myself
when I was with him?

291
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,161
"Someone will rescue me eventually."

292
00:24:16,788 --> 00:24:19,249
You graduated
from the National Police University.

293
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:25,005
You're so smart,
you must have known something was off.

294
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,011
But instead of you,

295
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,973
the person walking through that door…

296
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,605
was always him.

297
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:27,275
Yeon-hui.

298
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,111
I was waiting.

299
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,156
Why?

300
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,869
Why didn't you even try to come save me?

301
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:39,871
Where were you?

302
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,215
In ten meters,
you will arrive at your destination.

303
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,495
911. What is your emergency?

304
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:22,122
Yes, hello, uh…

305
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:26,334
My… My kid…
My child, uh, my child has gone missing.

306
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,628
You're reporting that
your child is missing?

307
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,089
Kwon… Kwon Yang-rae, Kwon Yang-rae.

308
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:33,216
The, uh, the rapist
that lives in the area.

309
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,719
He's here.
Uh, I mean, I'm in front of his house.

310
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,471
Sir, all right, please calm down.
Explain to me what's going on.

311
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,016
He's planning to…
He's going to bury something.

312
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,727
He's got a shovel.
I see him with a shovel.

313
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,354
Sir, are you saying that
you witnessed a crime?

314
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:50,025
No, I said my child has gone missing,
but right now--

315
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:51,943
When was your child last seen?

316
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,613
I said Kwon Yang-rae,
the rapist in our neighborhood.

317
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,281
Look him up and see!

318
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:58,658
Well, sir,
have you reported your child missing?

319
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:10,420
Send some officers to meet me
in front of Kwon Yang-rae's house.

320
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,298
Right now I'm in front of--

321
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,716
Are you there?

322
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:33,503
FOXHILL PASS, 1.5 KM

323
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,614
Pastor, I'm surprised to see you.

324
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,075
You haven't been following me, have you?

325
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:48,286
Is everything all right?

326
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:07,388
I'm gonna head home now.
I hope you have a good night.

327
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,650
Yeon-u.

328
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,069
Yeon-u.

329
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,738
Yeon-u.

330
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,160
Pastor.

331
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,790
What do you think you're doing?

332
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:39,963
Please move.

333
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,659
WIFE
LEE SI-YEONG

334
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,245
I found Yeon-u.

335
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,041
You know Yeon-u's friend, No-el?

336
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:43,419
No-el invited Yeon-u over,
so No-el's dad picked them up.

337
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,672
He said he told the teacher.

338
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,424
I guess the message was lost
during the school shift change.

339
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,177
Anyway, the responsible thing

340
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,305
would have been for No-el's parents
to have called us to let us know.

341
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,099
If I told you,

342
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:58,476
you would tell me
not to play with No-el again.

343
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,187
Hey!
I told you I'm talking to your father!

344
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,730
Stop your crying!

345
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,900
Where are you? Why aren't you home?

346
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,205
Are you Inspector Lee Yeon-hui?

347
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:27,667
Hello, ma'am.

348
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:30,044
I'm your teammate
in Violent Crimes Unit 4, So Eun-gyu.

349
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,003
It's a pleasure.

350
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,046
Ah, hi.

351
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,881
You're already being requested
by the captain.

352
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:38,553
There's a briefing for a new case,
so, uh, are you ready to go?

353
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,470
Sure.

354
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:42,932
It's not
a simple disappearance case.

355
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:44,475
Oh, here they are.

356
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,644
Before we begin the briefing,

357
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:49,981
meet Inspector Lee Yeon-hui,
a new member of Violent Crimes Unit 4.

358
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:50,982
Say hello.

359
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:55,444
A big case broke out last night,
so it's a bit hectic.

360
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,821
Let's get back to it.

361
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:59,115
At 10:30 p.m. last night,

362
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:02,368
Sung Min-chan,
the head of Mission Nation Church,

363
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,828
called the police.

364
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:08,416
He said Kwon Yang-rae,
a two-time convicted sex offender,

365
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,918
seemed like he might be up to something.

366
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,671
Kwon Yang-rae wears an ankle monitor
and lives in the area.

367
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,924
Last night, he cut off his ankle monitor
and has disappeared.

368
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,845
And a middle school girl
has been reported missing.

369
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,388
Her name is Shin A-yeong.

370
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,474
She attends Mission Nation Church.

371
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,392
After the service,

372
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,061
she and her friends left to sing karaoke
and went home.

373
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,189
But Shin A-yeong never arrived.

374
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,775
Unit 1, I want you to start
interviewing Shin A-yeong's friends.

375
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:35,818
Yes, sir.

376
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:38,571
Unit 4, interview the man
who called this in last night.

377
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:39,780
Yes, sir.

378
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,157
All right. Get moving.

379
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,433
Crime Scene Team
will be here within five minutes.

380
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:13,773
-Ah, you're here.
-Hey.

381
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:15,816
Oh, man.

382
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,694
I think Kwon Yang-rae
really did live here.

383
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,072
I don't know how he did.

384
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,283
What? There's no power?

385
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,577
No. His electricity's cut off.

386
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,794
Hey, try moving all the furniture out.

387
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,420
Yes, sir. Give me a hand.

388
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,852
Huh.

389
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:52,770
I found something.

390
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,399
Whoa.

391
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:04,073
This bastard…
is some kinda psychopath.

392
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:12,290
CHARGE FOR INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER

393
00:38:23,843 --> 00:38:26,012
TURNING YOURSELF IN
FOR INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER

394
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:39,734
Hello?

395
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:44,989
Yes?

396
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,326
Uh, Pastor Sung Min-chan, correct?

397
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:51,996
That's right. How may I…

398
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,497
We're from the police department.

399
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,792
We're following up on your call to us
reporting Kwon Yang-rae last night.

400
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:00,004
You said it looked like
he was going to bury a dead body.

401
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:02,757
I did.

402
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:08,804
Kwon Yang-rae, uh, um…
He, uh, he came to my church yesterday.

403
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,599
When he was here,
he seemed a little suspicious.

404
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,810
I noticed he had on an electronic anklet.
I was surprised to see that.

405
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:18,105
Then I got a call from my wife
that my ch… child was missing.

406
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:23,194
I suspected Kwon Yang-rae,
which is why I went to his house but…

407
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,322
But what?

408
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:29,492
Um, I saw him holding a shovel.

409
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:34,872
I assumed he was about to bury a body,
so I called the police and told them that.

410
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:38,167
What about your child?

411
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,002
Oh, uh…

412
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:42,129
We were mistaken.

413
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:45,591
He ended up being all right.

414
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:48,427
We found out that…
he was at a friend's house.

415
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,637
Ah, I see.

416
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:55,101
Hmm. Well, there's also
the case of a missing middle school girl.

417
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,018
Shin A-yeong.

418
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:59,647
A-- A-yeong from our church?

419
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,315
Yes.

420
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,570
What-- What happened to A-yeong?

421
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,030
May I look in here?

422
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,075
Yes, of course.

423
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,493
Sure.

424
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:26,632
Kwon Yang-rae,
how long was he here?

425
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:30,594
Uh, I asked him to fill out
our new member registration form,

426
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,807
but he left
while I stepped out to take a call.

427
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,370
Tell me, Pastor,

428
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,540
what did you do
after you called the police?

429
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,918
I headed straight home after that.

430
00:41:16,223 --> 00:41:19,852
Mind you, we have no evidence
of him abducting Shin A-yeong yet.

431
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,188
We're still
in the investigating stages right now.

432
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:26,567
So please give us a call
if you happen to remember anything else.

433
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,485
Here's my card.

434
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:28,903
Will do.

435
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:43,936
PASTOR, I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE

436
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:53,195
YESTERDAY, I

437
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:59,201
MIN-CHAN… LET'S TALK IN PERSON,
COME TO MY CHURCH NOW…

438
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:42,244
Pastor Jung.

439
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,248
I've got a big problem.

440
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:51,837
I guess you already heard…

441
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:55,758
the news about my son.

442
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:08,145
I taught him to never do anyone wrong.

443
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,109
What was he thinking?

444
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:17,196
I can't believe he's having an affair
with a church member.

445
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:26,872
Um, he just… He only got married recently.

446
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,126
Well, and…

447
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:34,546
…you know how tender-hearted Hwan-su is.

448
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:38,258
He is too tender-hearted for his own good.

449
00:44:39,009 --> 00:44:40,678
That's why he let her seduce him.

450
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:42,554
I told him to end it.

451
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,891
I told him to end things with her
as soon as possible.

452
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:50,354
I said he should go back to his wife
and repent.

453
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,397
But that girl…

454
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:53,816
The girl he had an affair with…

455
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:58,862
she posted their relationship details
on the church's website.

456
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:01,407
Here, look wh… what she wrote.

457
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,868
I'm telling you.
She approached him on purpose! Right?

458
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,125
Goodness.

459
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,212
He's going away.

460
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:21,385
I'm sending Hwan-su abroad for a few years
to do missionary work.

461
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,930
He needs to get away from this.

462
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,143
This is insane.

463
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,280
How could he let lust blind him
when his duty is to serve God?

464
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:48,954
I've… always told him to live his life
for God and nothing else.

465
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,005
Min-chan.

466
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:00,841
Maybe this…

467
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:05,387
was all a part of God's larger plan.

468
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,308
Pastor Jung…

469
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:17,733
does it… smell like… something sweet?

470
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,945
About the Heavensfolk Church,
that I'm building…

471
00:46:25,073 --> 00:46:28,869
I was hoping…
that you could be the pastor in charge.

472
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:41,507
I suppose that this is God's will.

473
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:46,178
And we must always follow His will,
as you know.

474
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:48,597
Min-chan.

475
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:53,477
Lead Heavensfolk Church.
Do your very best.

476
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,772
Expand it into something amazing.

477
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,276
Thy will be done.

478
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:05,906
God's will…

479
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,244
thy will be done.

480
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:22,714
Kwon Yang-rae's probation officer
said he showed no strange signs at all.

481
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,883
And he worked hard
at the demolition company.

482
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:27,594
He also hasn't missed
a single session with me.

483
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:32,057
His condition, to my knowledge,
had improved quite significantly.

484
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,934
Do you know when he drew this?

485
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,978
Our forensic team's working on it,

486
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:39,022
but it looked like it was drawn recently.

487
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:39,940
Recently?

488
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,569
He showed absolutely no signs…

489
00:47:44,653 --> 00:47:46,321
but committed a crime?

490
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:54,413
That must be
Kwon Yang-rae's psychiatrist.

491
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,086
Mental illness can be
caused by many things,

492
00:48:01,169 --> 00:48:03,005
including genetics.

493
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:06,133
It's hard to narrow it down
to one specific cause.

494
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:11,847
Being abused by his stepfather as a child
must've played a key role.

495
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,348
How was he abused?

496
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:16,727
His stepfather beat him to the point that
he ended up with a dent in his skull.

497
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,979
He also dunked his hand in boiling water.

498
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:23,191
He was waterboarded,
lying face up on the bathroom floor.

499
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:25,736
As well as being sexually abused.

500
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,070
Thank you.

501
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:29,156
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

502
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,741
Mr. Kwon Yang-rae…

503
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,369
…has over a hundred scars
remaining on his body.

504
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:38,540
These scars are from the abuse
he suffered for ten years.

505
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:41,752
Doctor, in your opinion,

506
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:44,212
could he develop
into a well-adjusted adult?

507
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:47,215
Yes, not everyone
with these traumatic experiences

508
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,675
develop into criminals.

509
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,471
In this particular case,
things could've been different,

510
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:54,556
had he been treated in time.

511
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:58,727
Mr. Kwon Yang-rae
was abused for ten years.

512
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,397
It was only at the age of sixteen,

513
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:04,566
after he was sent
to juvenile hall for assault,

514
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:06,318
that he was able to escape his stepfather.

515
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:08,111
When he was quite young, he--

516
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:11,365
No, wait. What are you doing?

517
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,491
Yeon-hui.

518
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,035
Why are you doing this?

519
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,997
Why are you giving him an excuse
to escape punishment?

520
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:22,459
You laughed?

521
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:24,586
You laughed?

522
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:25,754
Please calm down.

523
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:27,589
-Get off of me!
-Come with us, ma'am.

524
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,466
-Yeon-hui!
-He's pure evil!

525
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:30,676
You need to leave.

526
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:33,261
Whose side are you even on?

527
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,639
Let go! I said let go of me!

528
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:36,556
Hey!

529
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:38,225
Dr. Lee Nak-seong.

530
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,311
It's been a while.

531
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:43,689
Lee Yeon-hui, Violent Crimes Unit.

532
00:49:46,566 --> 00:49:49,486
Have we… Have you and I met?

533
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,030
We've met before.

534
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:54,741
Kwon Yang-rae's case from five years ago.

535
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,829
The victim was abused
and held against her will.

536
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:01,206
She managed to escape
and called the police.

537
00:50:01,289 --> 00:50:02,499
Her name was Lee Yeon-ju.

538
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,211
I'm her sister.

539
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,424
I've always wanted to ask you a question.

540
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,301
What were you thinking?

541
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:17,014
Why did you create a reason
for Kwon Yang-rae to get away with it?

542
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,183
At that time…

543
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,937
I was testifying as an expert witness.

544
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,897
You're aware I'm a psychiatrist?

545
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:30,110
Well, I study and treat mental illnesses
for a living.

546
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,611
You "treat" them?

547
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:33,655
How long have you been treating that guy?

548
00:50:34,406 --> 00:50:35,741
Where is Shin A-yeong?

549
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,118
This is all your fault.

550
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:42,706
All this happened because
you created an excuse for that devil.

551
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:48,086
It's repeating again,
just after a few years, because of you.

552
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,172
He's not the devil.

553
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,760
He's just a human being. A broken one.

554
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:57,429
Do you want to save Shin A-yeong?

555
00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:00,223
I suggest that you learn
more about Kwon Yang-rae.

556
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:01,641
Don't get me wrong,

557
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:04,352
I understand you feeling that way,
being the victim's family.

558
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:05,854
But as a detective…

559
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,276
I should get going.

560
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,073
His story went viral after that trial.

561
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,744
Everyone talked about him
as though he deserved pity.

562
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:23,580
As if he had no choice…

563
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:24,915
SYMPATHY FOR THE OFFENDER, WHY?

564
00:51:24,998 --> 00:51:26,458
…but to turn out the way he did.

565
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:29,169
Shortly after that…

566
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:34,883
my sister, Yeon-ju, took her own life.

567
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:39,387
She had survived horrific torture
and managed to escape,

568
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,181
but you…

569
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,184
You killed her.

570
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:22,472
Pastor.

571
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:27,894
Pastor. Pastor Sung, right?

572
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:33,233
-Yes, uh…
-I'm… A-yeong's mother.

573
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,819
A-yeong's mother!

574
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:37,946
Uh, what brings you here?

575
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:39,364
My daughter, A-yeong…

576
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:41,783
Wh… Why is my daughter…

577
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,327
Why don't we-- Le… Let's go…

578
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:47,038
Let's go inside and talk.
Come with me. Okay?

579
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,456
What happened to my…

580
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:58,800
Here you go. We'll find A-yeong.
We'll do everything we can.

581
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,387
I have to find her.

582
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:06,016
Um, but, Pastor…

583
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:08,685
Hypothetically…

584
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,188
speaking…

585
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:15,734
What if s… something
already happened to A-yeong?

586
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:18,153
Don't speak like that.
How could you even think about that?

587
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,613
I know, but if…

588
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,615
What if I…

589
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,368
If the police suddenly call and…

590
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:29,831
…tell me that something happened to her
and everyone says I have to confirm--

591
00:53:29,915 --> 00:53:31,333
Ma'am, please. You must stay strong.

592
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:32,792
A-yeong must be alive.

593
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:37,797
Right, Pastor? She must be, right?
My daughter has to be alive.

594
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,674
Yes. Of course, she is.

595
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,302
Let us pray.

596
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:48,266
Almighty God, our dear Lord, our shepherd.

597
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:52,896
You guide us and you protect us
every single step of the way,

598
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:55,607
so you must know where A-yeong is

599
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:58,610
and what kind of situation
she is in right now.

600
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,239
Even if your little lamb, A-yeong,
is in a dark place,

601
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:05,200
we believe that she is alive
and that you are with her.

602
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:08,411
Lord, please be with us
in this distressing situation.

603
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,163
We desperately need your help.

604
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:12,582
This is camera footage
near Kwon Yang-rae's place

605
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:13,917
a day before his disappearance.

606
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:17,754
Looks like he deliberately damaged
four security cameras near his home

607
00:54:17,837 --> 00:54:18,672
over the weekend.

608
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,842
He seems to have come up
with a thorough plan a few days prior.

609
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:26,888
What was the control center doing
while he was breaking all those cameras?

610
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:29,224
A lot of cameras broke
due to lightning and heavy rain,

611
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,809
so they thought that was the case.

612
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:33,270
Any home security or dashcams
in the vicinity?

613
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,855
We checked but because of the rain,
couldn't secure a visual.

614
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,650
That's frustrating.

615
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:40,485
Yes.

616
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:42,612
Ah, okay, got it.

617
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,615
-Captain, they found Kwon's car.
-Where?

618
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:48,868
-Near Foxhill Pass on Cheonil Mountain.
-Come on, everyone, get moving.

619
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:50,787
-What're you waiting for? Go!
-Yes, sir.

620
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,298
I can just take the bus, Pastor.

621
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:04,759
It's better if I drive you.

622
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,722
You have to keep thinking positive.

623
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:18,106
I have an idea. How about
we all get together and pray?

624
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:22,360
I'll assemble a community prayer vigil

625
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,821
and everybody that loves A-yeong
will be there.

626
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,324
-We can be sure--
-Hello?

627
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,785
Um, what about A-yeong?

628
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,915
No, I… I want to be there.

629
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,960
No, I have to be there! I'm her mother!

630
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:41,463
Send me the address.

631
00:55:41,546 --> 00:55:42,422
Okay.

632
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:45,467
What is it? What happened?

633
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,011
They found that asshole's car.

634
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,056
What do I do?

635
00:55:52,766 --> 00:55:54,642
What do I do?

636
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:57,812
Where is it? I'll take you.

637
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:15,288
We will
begin searching Areas 1-3.

638
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,624
The Forensic team is on it now.

639
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:18,625
Copy.

640
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:20,960
There has to be something.
We need to find it.

641
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:24,964
Requesting additional support
for Areas 1-4.

642
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:32,013
That bastard.
I wonder why he came here.

643
00:56:32,722 --> 00:56:35,266
Looks like he abandoned his car.
Where is he?

644
00:56:37,143 --> 00:56:39,604
Do you think A-yeong escaped
on their way here?

645
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:40,605
Possible.

646
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,609
What is all this?

647
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:46,778
Find something?

648
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,089
Forensics!

649
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:17,475
Hey! Try to search over there.

650
00:57:19,018 --> 00:57:21,604
-Find anything?
-No, sir. There's nothing here.

651
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:36,327
-Why are you being like this?
-Sir, please…

652
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,788
Okay, okay, I know.
I'm her dad, so let me in.

653
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:40,665
Why are you being like this?

654
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:43,835
Ugh! Hey! Let me in, just for a minute.
Get out of my way!

655
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,211
-Honey!
-You can't go in!

656
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,463
Please calm down!

657
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:48,923
-Where's A-yeong?
-Honey! They're still searching for her.

658
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:50,216
-Let's go that way.
-A-yeong!

659
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:51,217
You can't go in.

660
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,387
We are A-yeong's parents!
You need to tell us what's going on!

661
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,097
-A-yeong!
-Barricades…

662
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:57,056
What's going on?

663
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,185
Shin A-yeong's parents.

664
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,104
-A-yeong!
-Let us look for her.

665
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,898
Guys, it's okay. It's okay.

666
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,816
You must be A-yeong's parents.

667
00:58:08,109 --> 00:58:09,444
Have you found her?

668
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:12,071
No, not yet.
We haven't found any clues yet.

669
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,406
You found his car though.

670
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:16,618
Right, we did,
but we're still investigating.

671
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:19,662
Did you not find a body?

672
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:25,043
"Body"?

673
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:27,712
"Body"? Do you mean…

674
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,799
Is my daughter…

675
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:32,967
Is my A-yeong…

676
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,093
No, ma'am.

677
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,595
-My A-yeong!
-Oh, no.

678
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:36,596
-Careful.
-Medics.

679
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,473
-Come help us!
-Here! Over here!

680
00:58:39,349 --> 00:58:42,018
Honey, are you okay?
Honey, honey! Are you okay?

681
00:58:43,311 --> 00:58:45,063
What are we going to do with this?

682
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:51,903
This guy breaks all the security cameras.
We can't get any clues from them.

683
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:55,740
Hey. Was there no dashcam in his car?

684
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:57,075
No, no dashcam.

685
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:59,827
So we found no evidence?

686
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:02,038
Nothing.
It rained a lot yesterday,

687
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:04,040
so I'd be surprised if we found anything.

688
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:07,460
Seems like
the universe is helping this asshole.

689
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,417
What's gotten into you?

690
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,837
You never liked
to volunteer at the care center

691
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,547
because of the ladies and their politics.

692
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:57,302
Aren't you holding
a prayer service for A-yeong?

693
00:59:57,802 --> 00:59:59,345
Shouldn't you be getting ready?

694
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:00,680
Si-yeong.

695
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:03,808
Don't you have something to tell me?

696
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:06,436
Huh?

697
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:12,150
You can say it. You can confess to me.

698
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:14,777
What do you mean?

699
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,252
Si-yeong.

700
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:35,506
I know it's my fault.

701
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:39,594
We're in this mess because of me.

702
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,013
But…

703
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:46,225
But I've repented for everything.

704
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:51,898
It's your turn.

705
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:54,692
Do you have anything to tell me?

706
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,362
What are you saying?

707
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:58,821
Come on!

708
01:01:02,533 --> 01:01:03,618
Listen carefully.

709
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:08,164
Remember that new church that we saw?

710
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,000
Pastor Jung asked me
to be the pastor in charge.

711
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,547
You know, I looked into it.

712
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:19,967
Hwan-su's getting that church,
everyone knows that.

713
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:22,804
You said
Jung Guk-hwan was your spiritual father?

714
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:25,390
-You're always so ridiculously gullible--
-Si-yeong.

715
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:29,227
Watch what you say to me.

716
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:35,650
Hwan-su… is doing mission work abroad.

717
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:37,652
You know why?

718
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,073
It's because he sinned.

719
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,368
He committed adultery.

720
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:59,590
I'm sorry. Hey, I'm sorry.

721
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:05,096
This is God's revelation.

722
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:07,306
We must become sinless before God.

723
01:02:07,390 --> 01:02:09,434
In order for us to receive
God's revelation,

724
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:11,144
we must be completely sinless.

725
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:16,816
Si-yeong.

726
01:02:19,152 --> 01:02:20,361
Come on, confess.

727
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:25,116
I… I…

728
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:28,786
I'm gonna be late.

729
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:38,087
God knows everything though.

730
01:02:41,382 --> 01:02:43,301
You can't hide from Him.

731
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,518
Confess.

732
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:03,070
I have committed
the mortal sin of adultery.

733
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,034
Louder.

734
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:11,788
Heavenly Almighty.

735
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:15,958
I've sinned
and committed adultery with another man.

736
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:17,335
Louder!

737
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:20,046
This confession must reach
the ears of God. Louder!

738
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:24,675
Almighty God,
I committed adultery with another man!

739
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,219
-Amen!
-Amen.

740
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:29,931
Amen! Amen!

741
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,182
-Amen.
-Amen.

742
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:32,725
-Amen…
-Almighty God.

743
01:03:32,809 --> 01:03:36,103
-Amen.
-This lost sheep repents for her sins.

744
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:37,939
We have sinned many times.

745
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:39,315
Please listen to us

746
01:03:39,398 --> 01:03:42,235
as we sincerely repent to you
and before you.

747
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:44,028
Your boundless love…

748
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:52,662
Sir, this is completely…
It's definitely stuck.

749
01:04:01,045 --> 01:04:03,089
Hello, do you… Do you need a hand?

750
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:04,674
No, it's okay.

751
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:08,803
The tow truck will be here any minute.
But we appreciate it.

752
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:12,974
-All right.
-Be careful. The road is narrow.

753
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:29,365
YEONGJIN ASSISTED LIVING CENTER

754
01:04:29,448 --> 01:04:31,534
-My gosh. Look at this.
-Mrs. Lee.

755
01:04:31,617 --> 01:04:32,618
Oh.

756
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:34,161
-Hi.
-Oh, you're early.

757
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:37,582
Oh, wow.
Pastor Sung, what brings you here?

758
01:04:37,665 --> 01:04:39,333
Did you just come to drop her off?

759
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:41,836
You two are still so in love.

760
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:44,589
-It's all thanks to their faith.
-Amen.

761
01:04:44,672 --> 01:04:47,133
You're filled with God's grace.

762
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,969
I wish I could've been here earlier
to help you all get ready.

763
01:04:50,970 --> 01:04:53,472
The caterer will be taking care
of everything.

764
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:55,516
We'll just watch them cook, while we chat.

765
01:04:56,517 --> 01:04:58,436
There's so much evil in the world
we must discuss.

766
01:04:58,519 --> 01:04:59,437
My dear Lord.

767
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:03,941
What is it? What's wrong?

768
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:07,278
Oh. No. I'm just waiting on the ambulance.

769
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:11,032
Oh. We saw an ambulance
waiting for a tow truck.

770
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:12,283
I can't believe this.

771
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:14,493
What's wrong? Is someone hurt?

772
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:18,247
Well, a man showed up earlier
covered in dirt and blood.

773
01:05:18,331 --> 01:05:21,042
He crawled here and passed out.
I think he's badly hurt.

774
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:24,295
I think he should be taken
to a proper hospital.

775
01:05:25,212 --> 01:05:27,298
I wonder what happened to him.

776
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:30,301
He must have crawled here
from that mountain up there.

777
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:32,720
My goodness. That sounds serious.

778
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:35,014
Where is he now? Do you have room for him?

779
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:38,434
Oh, we moved him to the ward upstairs
so he could lie down.

780
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,561
But if the ambulance doesn't come…

781
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:43,522
When my husband asked
the ambulance drivers if they needed help,

782
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,441
they said a tow truck was on the way.

783
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:46,525
I'm glad.

784
01:05:46,609 --> 01:05:50,237
Ah, everyone! Don't you need
to oversee them set up the cafeteria?

785
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:51,989
-Yes, let's do that.
-Yes.

786
01:05:52,073 --> 01:05:54,617
We should get changed,
and we need to take photos.

787
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:56,077
Yes! You're right.

788
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,788
You ladies are busy.
I should be on my way.

789
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:01,082
Pastor, you should stay and eat with us.

790
01:06:01,165 --> 01:06:03,376
I'm holding a prayer service this evening.

791
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,002
-Ah.
-I should get ready.

792
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:05,962
All right.

793
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:07,129
Shall we?

794
01:06:07,213 --> 01:06:09,048
I'll take you to the room
next to the cafeteria.

795
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:10,132
-Okay.
-This way please.

796
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:12,551
-Let's go in.
-Watch your step.

797
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:13,886
-Go on inside.
-Yeah.

798
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:20,286
A pastor…

799
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:26,208
A pastor tried to…

800
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:39,388
A pastor… A pastor tried to…

801
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:43,184
A pastor tried to…

802
01:07:43,267 --> 01:07:45,102
…kill me.

803
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,608
This isn't what I want to do.

804
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:34,318
God's will must be done.

805
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,438
You took so long!

806
01:09:11,522 --> 01:09:13,023
-Where's the patient?
-Upstairs.

807
01:09:38,465 --> 01:09:40,050
This way!

808
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:45,598
It was this man, correct?

809
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:47,975
Yes, it was him.

810
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,105
We had no idea that man was a criminal,
so we just took him in and helped him.

811
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:55,482
That must be why he fled.

812
01:09:55,983 --> 01:09:58,360
-Can we see the room you put him in?
-Of course.

813
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:03,908
It's this way.

814
01:10:10,289 --> 01:10:12,708
Can we check the footage
from that camera up there?

815
01:10:12,791 --> 01:10:16,253
Oh. Um, that camera is very old.
It actually doesn't work.

816
01:10:16,337 --> 01:10:18,672
Could we get in trouble for that?

817
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:21,425
We're really struggling
to make ends meet here.

818
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:24,053
Uh, we don't handle
that type of thing.

819
01:10:26,055 --> 01:10:27,097
He was here.

820
01:10:30,809 --> 01:10:31,977
He took him.

821
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:35,314
Someone took him?

822
01:10:36,190 --> 01:10:37,274
Who was it?

823
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:48,160
It was the Almighty. Our Heavenly God.

824
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:50,329
Amen.

825
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:53,540
Dad, did you just say "amen"?

826
01:10:53,624 --> 01:10:54,667
You hated the church.

827
01:10:55,334 --> 01:10:56,919
What a surprise.

828
01:10:57,711 --> 01:11:00,714
Well, I… I have to believe in God…

829
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:02,883
This man's had dementia for over 20 years.

830
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:06,053
Yeah, that's right.
I believe you. I believe you, Dad.

831
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,516
-How many entrances and exits are there?
-Oh.

832
01:11:10,599 --> 01:11:11,475
Is there a back door?

833
01:11:11,558 --> 01:11:13,978
There's one over here
and there's an exit by the kitchen.

834
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:15,354
Oh. May I see?

835
01:11:19,858 --> 01:11:20,901
Who are they?

836
01:11:21,568 --> 01:11:23,654
Oh! Uh, they are pastors' wives

837
01:11:23,737 --> 01:11:26,073
who come here to volunteer
on a regular basis.

838
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:30,035
Do you think we could possibly
get a list of the churches they're from?

839
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,537
Yeah. Absolutely. Yes.

840
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:38,002
♪ Giver of immortal gladness ♪

841
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:40,713
♪ Fill us with the light of day ♪

842
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,063
Surprised?

843
01:11:58,605 --> 01:12:00,816
You managed to survive, but here I am.

844
01:12:01,608 --> 01:12:02,526
You asshole…

845
01:12:04,528 --> 01:12:05,988
why are you doing this to me?

846
01:12:07,448 --> 01:12:08,365
Good question.

847
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:12,077
That's what I'm really curious about.

848
01:12:12,911 --> 01:12:16,457
Why does the Lord
always keep leading me back to you?

849
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:19,335
Why?

850
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:24,423
Like with that care home.
I hadn't been there in so long.

851
01:12:25,007 --> 01:12:28,427
When I woke up this morning,
I, all of a sudden, had to go there.

852
01:12:30,929 --> 01:12:31,764
Why?

853
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:34,058
Out of nowhere?

854
01:12:40,230 --> 01:12:42,066
The day of Pentecost.

855
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,818
The anointing of the Holy Spirit!

856
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:48,405
The Holy Spirit was sent to me by God
and led me straight there.

857
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:49,573
Holy Spirit?

858
01:12:50,866 --> 01:12:56,747
You're just trying to hide the fact
that you tried to kill me.

859
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:58,374
Wait, hold on.

860
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,043
It's all clear to me now.

861
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:07,216
Now I know why God keeps leading…
leading me to a child of Satan.

862
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:09,051
I get it.

863
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:13,055
He wants to see just how much
I'm willing to obey his commandment.

864
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,232
I mean, look around us.

865
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:29,738
This hotel was built because of rumors
about a new golf course in the area.

866
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:31,323
The developer went bankrupt.

867
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:33,534
And it's been abandoned
for over three years.

868
01:13:35,702 --> 01:13:39,623
Who knew this creepy, derelict building
would be useful.

869
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:42,876
It was prepared by Him.

870
01:13:43,377 --> 01:13:44,711
It's God's providence!

871
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:52,177
This is truly a miracle.

872
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:58,600
You're crazy. You completely lost it.

873
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:02,771
So what now?

874
01:14:04,148 --> 01:14:05,482
You gonna kill me?

875
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:07,484
I don't know.

876
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,572
I'm waiting for God.

877
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:17,202
We are all just God's servants
who obey his orders.

878
01:14:20,497 --> 01:14:21,999
If you kill me, you know,

879
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:25,210
you won't ever find that girl.

880
01:14:27,754 --> 01:14:29,006
That little girl…

881
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:29,923
What?

882
01:14:30,507 --> 01:14:32,426
The girl who goes to your church.

883
01:14:33,469 --> 01:14:35,220
She's still alive.

884
01:14:42,686 --> 01:14:43,812
Where is A-yeong?

885
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:47,274
Call the police,

886
01:14:48,650 --> 01:14:50,360
and I'll confess everything.

887
01:15:12,216 --> 01:15:13,050
Where is A-yeong?

888
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:17,179
Kill me now, Pastor,

889
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,474
that girl dies as well.

890
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,941
Where is she? Tell me!

891
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:30,359
Call the police.

Do we have their dashcam footage?

902
01:17:57,964 --> 01:18:00,592
Yeah, everyone parked here

We can't throw a welcome party for you,

How long has it been
since she was last seen?

911
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,495
It's been 24 hours, sir.

926
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:04,461
Today, we will be reading from the passage

927
01:22:06,546 --> 01:22:11,468
Deuteronomy 24:7.

928
01:22:12,969 --> 01:22:14,054
I'll begin.

929
01:22:17,390 --> 01:22:21,102
"If someone is caught
kidnapping a fellow Israelite

930
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:23,855
and treating that person as a slave,

931
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,858
or selling their fellow person
into bondage,

932
01:22:27,525 --> 01:22:28,526
the kidnapper, then,

933
01:22:29,945 --> 01:22:30,862
must die."

934
01:22:32,405 --> 01:22:36,284
"You must purge the evil
that lies amongst you all."

935
01:22:36,368 --> 01:22:38,119
Amen.

936
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:39,037
Amen.

937
01:22:45,543 --> 01:22:46,670
Let us now pray.

938
01:22:49,172 --> 01:22:50,423
Dear Heavenly Father.

939
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:55,679
Everyone who loves
your little, precious lamb, Shin A-yeong,

940
01:22:55,762 --> 01:22:56,596
is here now.

941
01:22:57,722 --> 01:23:00,558
We know that A-yeong
is watching over us from heaven.

942
01:23:02,686 --> 01:23:05,021
A-yeong's mother is utterly devastated.

943
01:23:05,522 --> 01:23:09,234
Please allow her to feel
the sense of peace A-yeong is able to now.

944
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:10,860
Amen!

945
01:23:10,944 --> 01:23:13,279
We know that you never ignore
or keep a deaf ear,

946
01:23:13,363 --> 01:23:15,532
but listen to our prayers
and cries for help.

947
01:23:16,032 --> 01:23:16,866
Amen!

948
01:23:16,950 --> 01:23:18,618
Punishments to all whom are evil,

949
01:23:18,702 --> 01:23:22,580
purging all
that are here to go against us.

950
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:24,290
God, all of your precious children

951
01:23:24,374 --> 01:23:27,085
remember your wrath, your fairness,
and your righteousness!

952
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:28,211
Amen!

953
01:23:28,294 --> 01:23:32,048
You love those who are righteous,
but you hate those that sin,

954
01:23:32,132 --> 01:23:33,133
punishing them.

955
01:23:34,009 --> 01:23:35,343
In Sodom and Gomorrah,

956
01:23:35,427 --> 01:23:38,513
you punished
by raining sulfur and fire upon them.

957
01:23:38,596 --> 01:23:41,474
Now, with your right hand
majestic in power,

958
01:23:41,558 --> 01:23:44,394
judge all that is evil
with your righteous fire!

959
01:23:44,477 --> 01:23:45,854
Consume them all!

960
01:23:45,937 --> 01:23:48,106
Annihilate them all in your name!

961
01:23:48,189 --> 01:23:49,899
May your will be done!

962
01:23:51,359 --> 01:23:53,611
All of you now shout "Lord"
with me three times

963
01:23:53,695 --> 01:23:55,280

968

Kill him.

you've been waiting for.

you wanted to avenge me!

981
01:27:27,992 --> 01:27:29,619
He'll hurt more people.

982
01:27:29,702 --> 01:27:32,163
He'll hurt more people
if you don't kill him.

983

986
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:46,511
She's still alive for now.

987
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:50,265
He's lying!

988
01:27:52,308 --> 01:27:53,142
Yeon-hui,

989
01:27:54,143 --> 01:27:55,478
he's the devil.

990
01:27:57,146 --> 01:27:59,023
Don't side with the devil.

991
01:28:05,363 --> 01:28:07,031
I am a police officer.

992
01:28:08,283 --> 01:28:09,617
Where is Shin A-yeong?

993
01:28:13,746 --> 01:28:18,459
Hospital.
Take me to a hospital first. Please.

994
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:21,087
Just tell me where A-yeong is.

995
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:31,264
You'll kill me once I tell you.

996
01:28:32,181 --> 01:28:35,351
I won't kill you. I won't kill you.

997
01:28:37,020 --> 01:28:39,939
Listen to me. Stop the bullshit,
and tell me where A-yeong is.

998
01:28:40,023 --> 01:28:41,482
You're a crazy bitch, aren't you?

999
01:28:42,483 --> 01:28:45,278
Think I'll believe you
when you're glaring at me like that?

1000
01:28:46,029 --> 01:28:46,904
Fuck.

1001
01:28:47,947 --> 01:28:51,034
There are so many lunatics
in this neighborhood, aren't there.

1002
01:28:53,202 --> 01:28:54,329
Tell me, asshole.

1003
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:56,247
Where the hell have you been hiding her?

1004
01:28:56,331 --> 01:28:57,915
Just tell me or die!

1005
01:29:27,362 --> 01:29:29,655
Pastor! What… What are you doing?

1006
01:29:29,739 --> 01:29:31,449
You think it's a coincidence?

1007
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:34,494
There are no coincidences.

1008
01:29:36,871 --> 01:29:38,831
He led us all here.

1009
01:29:40,124 --> 01:29:41,376
Come to your senses.

1010
01:29:42,001 --> 01:29:44,253
Untie me! Untie me!

1011
01:29:47,673 --> 01:29:49,300
You see, God's will…

1012
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:54,013
isn't something
we mere humans can understand.

1013
01:29:55,264 --> 01:29:58,142
I had the biggest headache earlier.

1014
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:03,314
"What am I going to do with the body
once I kill that devil?"

1015
01:30:04,774 --> 01:30:07,652
"Should I just……burn it?"

1016
01:30:07,735 --> 01:30:10,738
"Or should I chop it into pieces
and dump it somewhere?"

1017
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:16,244
But God sent you to me, Detective.

1018
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:21,958
A-yeong! Do you know where she is?

1019
01:30:27,672 --> 01:30:29,132
A-yeong has perished.

1020
01:30:30,174 --> 01:30:31,676
She's lying dead somewhere.

1021
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,887
Let's not think about her.

1022
01:30:35,388 --> 01:30:37,557
It's time to follow God's will.

1023
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:40,852
It's time to punish this evil bastard
for what he did to A-yeong.

1024
01:30:42,353 --> 01:30:45,314
Pastor, turn yourself in.
It's not too late.

1025
01:30:46,524 --> 01:30:48,860
I'll tell them that
you were accidentally shot.

1026
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:51,529
He pulled the trigger
while fighting with you.

1027
01:30:52,363 --> 01:30:54,198
Then he tripped and fell to his death.

1028
01:30:55,533 --> 01:30:57,034
Wake up, Pastor, please.

1029
01:30:57,118 --> 01:30:59,328
If you kill him, we'll never find A-yeong!

1030
01:31:01,330 --> 01:31:04,000
Didn't you hear me?
I told you that she's dead.

1031
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:05,751
That evil monster killed her.

1032
01:31:13,718 --> 01:31:16,471
Oh, yeah! It's you.

1033
01:31:17,054 --> 01:31:18,723
You're Yeon-ju's sister.

1034
01:31:22,059 --> 01:31:24,854
I wondered why you followed me
and stared like that.

1035
01:31:27,440 --> 01:31:30,026
But let's be honest with ourselves.

1036
01:31:30,109 --> 01:31:31,736
Did I actually kill her?

1037
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:32,987
-Huh?
-What?

1038
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:37,325
She jumped to her death
all on her very own.

1039
01:31:37,408 --> 01:31:39,660
-Am I wrong?
-What the fuck did you just say?!

1040
01:31:40,578 --> 01:31:44,123
If everyone killed themselves
over a few days of suffering,

1041
01:31:44,207 --> 01:31:47,418
I would've died 10,000 times by now. Fuck!

1042
01:31:50,171 --> 01:31:54,550
Every night, the one-eyed monster
came knocking on my door.

1043
01:31:54,634 --> 01:31:57,595
Every night, he tied me up and hit me--

1044
01:31:57,678 --> 01:32:00,848
Shut up, devil!
Don't you dare flick your forked tongue.

1045
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:03,684
Stop it!
We have to find A-yeong.

1046
01:32:03,768 --> 01:32:06,646
I told you she's dead. She's already dead!

1047
01:32:06,729 --> 01:32:09,148
Otherwise,
I never would've received the revelation

1048
01:32:09,232 --> 01:32:10,441
to kill him like this!

1049
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:14,737
God is perfect, understand?
The Lord does things for a reason!

1050
01:32:14,820 --> 01:32:18,032
Please, please do something
about this crazy pastor.

1051
01:32:18,115 --> 01:32:20,326
Don't you want
to save A-yeong? A-yeong will--

1052
01:32:20,409 --> 01:32:21,661
Shut up, devil!

1053
01:32:22,328 --> 01:32:24,330
How dare you.
You're lying to get out of here alive.

1054
01:32:24,413 --> 01:32:26,874
-He said she isn't dead.
-I won't fall for your lies!

1055
01:32:26,958 --> 01:32:28,459
He said A-yeong is alive.

1056
01:32:29,418 --> 01:32:32,630
A-yeong isn't dead. A-yeong is alive!

1057
01:32:32,713 --> 01:32:34,882
Why would you let the devil deceive you?

1058
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:36,801
Can't you tell that he's lying?

1059
01:32:37,885 --> 01:32:39,011
If we don't kill him now,

1060
01:32:39,095 --> 01:32:41,806
there will be more innocent victims
just like A-yeong.

1065
01:33:00,199 --> 01:33:01,659
He's clearly insane.

♪ I will carry it now for Thee ♪

1067
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:05,538
He is the spawn of Satan.

1068
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:07,999
He's a monster.

1069
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:14,547
Because of people like you
who comfort devils like that

1070
01:33:15,381 --> 01:33:17,508
the whole world is becoming more evil.

The one-eyed monster ate her.

1075
01:35:23,926 --> 01:35:25,386
The one-eyed monster.

1076
01:36:02,339 --> 01:36:03,716
-Inspector Lee!
-Medics!

1077
01:36:04,925 --> 01:36:07,511
Hey, you two!
Go, quick. Examine him.

1078
01:36:09,972 --> 01:36:12,308
-Hey, everyone, move in!
-Say it. Tell me.

1079
01:36:13,225 --> 01:36:14,810
Tell me before you die!

1080
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:17,772
Enough. Come on.

1081
01:36:17,855 --> 01:36:18,731
Come with us.

1082
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:21,066
Not getting a pulse.

1083
01:36:21,150 --> 01:36:22,443
Transport him.

1084
01:36:24,737 --> 01:36:27,656
Go inside and check!

1085
01:37:08,364 --> 01:37:11,575
He says he received God's revelation
to kill Kwon Yang-rae.

1086
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:15,037
I don't think he has any idea
as to where Shin A-yeong might be.

1087
01:37:15,120 --> 01:37:17,248
Ugh, that crazy asshole.

1088
01:37:18,582 --> 01:37:21,335
Captain, Kwon Yang-rae's car
was found near Foxhill Pass,

1089
01:37:21,418 --> 01:37:23,712
I think because he was headed
to Redevelopment Zone Four

1090
01:37:23,796 --> 01:37:25,047
in Myeonbuk-dong.

1091
01:37:25,130 --> 01:37:27,508
He had been working there
and knew the area well.

1092
01:37:27,591 --> 01:37:30,427
He took her there, that's my bet.
It's the perfect place to hide her.

1093
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:33,180
How much time do you need
to comb through that area?

1094
01:37:33,264 --> 01:37:34,723
I'd say probably at least three days.

1095
01:37:34,807 --> 01:37:37,017
Three-- Then it'll be day five. Shit.

1096
01:37:37,101 --> 01:37:40,229
The chances of her being alive
after five days are slim.

1097

01:38:19,894 --> 01:38:21,729
Get moving. What are you waiting for?

1103
01:38:21,812 --> 01:38:22,730
Yes, sir!

1104
01:38:25,691 --> 01:38:28,903
Inspector, please go home.
Don't worry, we got this.

1105
01:38:28,986 --> 01:38:30,154
I'll call you if we find her.

1106
01:39:06,023 --> 01:39:06,857
Hey.

1107
01:39:09,151 --> 01:39:10,152
Mr. Kwon.

1108
01:39:11,570 --> 01:39:13,614
Hey, Mr. Kwon! Mr. Kwon!

1109
01:39:14,156 --> 01:39:14,990
Yeah?

1110
01:39:15,074 --> 01:39:18,953
Demolish it all. All of this has to go
by the end of the day, okay?

1111
01:39:19,036 --> 01:39:20,829
-Yeah, I got it.
-Right.

1112
01:39:56,490 --> 01:39:57,783
Oh, please come in.

1113
01:40:03,831 --> 01:40:06,166
I was surprised to get your call
so early in the morning.

1114
01:40:08,836 --> 01:40:10,045
DAD
IMAGE

1115
01:40:10,129 --> 01:40:11,380
SCAFFOLDING REMOVED

1116
01:40:12,589 --> 01:40:16,593
So, about that pastor,
I reviewed everything you sent.

1117
01:40:17,845 --> 01:40:19,304
Seems like a case of apophenia.

1118
01:40:20,431 --> 01:40:21,473
Apophenia?

1119
01:40:21,557 --> 01:40:25,644
It refers to the tendency to perceive
meaningful rules, patterns, or connections

1120
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:27,187
between unrelated things.

1121
01:40:28,647 --> 01:40:30,399
What you're seeing now…

1122
01:40:30,983 --> 01:40:32,151
is called pareidolia.

1123
01:40:32,985 --> 01:40:34,236
They're natural phenomena,

1124
01:40:34,319 --> 01:40:36,989
but some people believe
they see specific images.

1125
01:40:37,489 --> 01:40:42,161
People like him attach profound meanings.
Nothing is by chance to them.

1126
01:40:50,586 --> 01:40:51,587
Dr. Lee…

1127
01:40:53,714 --> 01:40:54,548
I…

1128
01:40:55,215 --> 01:40:59,845
I wanna learn more about Kwon Yang-rae.
Can you tell me about his life?

1129
01:41:13,650 --> 01:41:14,777
Horrible, right?

1130
01:41:16,528 --> 01:41:18,238
He was abused every single day.

1131
01:41:18,906 --> 01:41:22,201
Every time it happened,
his mother sang hymns outside his room.

1132
01:41:22,826 --> 01:41:24,661
She sang and prayed.

1133
01:41:27,122 --> 01:41:30,417
The one-eyed monster.
He talked about this before he died.

1134
01:41:31,752 --> 01:41:34,004
What do you think
this one-eyed monster means?

1135
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:36,465
It could symbolize his stepfather,

1136
01:41:37,758 --> 01:41:39,510
or it could represent himself.

1137
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:42,638
Do you see the people in its mouth?

1138
01:41:43,388 --> 01:41:46,600
I'm not sure if it means
he's in the monster's head

1139
01:41:47,309 --> 01:41:48,519
or if he is the monster.

1140
01:41:49,186 --> 01:41:50,938
A monster who swallowed his victims?

1141
01:41:51,021 --> 01:41:52,147
It's all speculation.

1142
01:41:52,231 --> 01:41:54,274
Like a puzzle, but one thing's for sure.

1143
01:41:54,358 --> 01:41:59,571
That monster is deeply connected
to his traumatic memories from childhood.

1144
01:43:02,801 --> 01:43:04,052
Are you having visions?

1145
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:11,643
My sister.

1146
01:43:14,188 --> 01:43:15,564
Sometimes I see her.

1147
01:43:17,733 --> 01:43:18,859
What happens?

1148
01:43:20,152 --> 01:43:21,528
Does she say something?

1149
01:43:24,656 --> 01:43:26,533
That she waited for me to rescue her.

1150
01:43:28,410 --> 01:43:29,244
But…

1151
01:43:30,829 --> 01:43:33,165
he was always the one
coming through that door.

1152
01:43:36,043 --> 01:43:37,586
You know it's not your sister.

1153
01:43:39,171 --> 01:43:40,339
That's not her.

1154
01:43:41,381 --> 01:43:42,216
Inspector Lee,

1155
01:43:43,717 --> 01:43:46,345
your visions are illusions
crafted from guilt.

1156
01:43:49,640 --> 01:43:50,766
I know.

1157
01:43:52,935 --> 01:43:54,353
I know it's not real.

1158
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:58,273
But I can't shake it off.

1159
01:44:04,154 --> 01:44:06,615
A-yeong must be waiting
for someone to rescue her.

1160
01:44:09,076 --> 01:44:13,163
She's probably waiting to see someone
walk through the door and save her.

1161
01:44:16,166 --> 01:44:18,377
But again,
there's nothing that I can do.

1162
01:44:20,712 --> 01:44:22,631
What if we can't find A-yeong?

1163
01:44:23,548 --> 01:44:25,467
If something bad already happened to her…

1164
01:44:27,552 --> 01:44:28,720
It's all my fault.

1165
01:44:30,097 --> 01:44:31,598
It's all my fault.

1166
01:44:35,352 --> 01:44:36,603
This is all my fault.

1167
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:41,275
Right.

1168
01:44:43,110 --> 01:44:44,653
You think it's all your fault.

1169
01:44:46,655 --> 01:44:49,533
Kwon Yang-rae blamed his tragedy
on the monster.

1170
01:44:50,325 --> 01:44:52,244
Sung Min-chan, God's revelation.

1171
01:44:52,828 --> 01:44:55,914
You blame yourself.
You think that it's all your fault.

1172
01:44:56,873 --> 01:44:59,501
These sound different,
but they're actually the same.

1173
01:45:00,043 --> 01:45:03,005
You all fixated on one thing
as the cause of a situation.

1174
01:45:05,007 --> 01:45:06,842
It's what a lot of people do.

1175
01:45:08,176 --> 01:45:09,261
Most tragedies are caused

1176
01:45:09,344 --> 01:45:11,805
by a combination of circumstances
we can't control.

1177
01:45:11,888 --> 01:45:13,473
Devils, monsters and the like,

1178
01:45:14,474 --> 01:45:17,019
they're created
by people seeking justification.

1179
01:45:24,735 --> 01:45:26,069
Then what should I do now?

1180
01:45:28,155 --> 01:45:29,281
I need to get to A-yeong.

1181
01:45:30,741 --> 01:45:31,783
I agree.

1182
01:45:32,701 --> 01:45:34,578
Think about what you can actually see.

1183
01:45:35,662 --> 01:45:39,333
Kwon Yang-rae was getting better,
so what triggered him to re-offend, huh?

1184
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:42,210
We have to find out
what awakened his monster.

1185
01:45:43,170 --> 01:45:45,756
I'm sure there's something
we happened to have missed.

1186
01:45:50,385 --> 01:45:52,846
Professor,
the dean would like to meet with you.

1187
01:45:54,389 --> 01:45:56,183
Ah, I'll be right back.

1188
01:46:11,156 --> 01:46:12,449
Come all the way!

1189
01:46:13,658 --> 01:46:17,537
To the right, to the right!
More, more, more, more!

1190
01:46:19,247 --> 01:46:20,248
Stop!

1191
01:46:41,853 --> 01:46:44,856
I would've died 10,000 times by now. Fuck!

1192
01:46:48,235 --> 01:46:52,447
Every night, the one-eyed monster
came knocking on my door.

1193
01:46:52,531 --> 01:46:55,492
Every night, he tied me up and hit me--

1194
01:47:05,627 --> 01:47:07,504
DAD

1195
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:15,762
What's up, Dad?

1196
01:47:15,846 --> 01:47:19,141
What's going on with you?
You're not responding to my texts.

1197
01:47:19,975 --> 01:47:21,810
You didn't even come home last night.

1198
01:47:21,893 --> 01:47:24,896
I know. I've been super busy. Sorry.

1199
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:26,106
I've been working on a case.

1200
01:47:27,816 --> 01:47:28,650
Why'd you call?

1201
01:47:28,733 --> 01:47:30,193
Did you see the picture I sent?

1202
01:47:31,153 --> 01:47:32,821
We finally removed the scaffolding.

1203
01:47:33,488 --> 01:47:34,990
You said you wanted to see it.

1204
01:47:35,657 --> 01:47:36,491
Oh, right.

1205
01:47:37,617 --> 01:47:38,535
Let me look.

1206
01:47:38,618 --> 01:47:39,828
The exterior is done,

1207
01:47:39,911 --> 01:47:43,039
but we'll probably need another month
to finish the interior.

1208
01:47:43,790 --> 01:47:46,918
There's a lot of big remodeling jobs
like this in this area.

1209
01:47:47,711 --> 01:47:49,880
They want to fix up all the old houses.

1210
01:47:50,380 --> 01:47:51,798
-Wait, Dad--
-My goodness.

1211
01:47:51,882 --> 01:47:53,300
This one was stressful.

1212
01:47:53,383 --> 01:47:55,969
The client wanted to highlight
the one-eyed thing.

1213
01:47:57,512 --> 01:47:58,472
"One-eyed thing"?

1214
01:47:58,972 --> 01:48:01,725
Yeah. Do you see the round window
right under the roof?

1215
01:48:03,226 --> 01:48:07,397
That's what's called an oculus window.
Some people call it a one-eyed window.

1216
01:48:08,565 --> 01:48:11,109
Back in the day,
they built a lot of houses like that.

1217
01:48:11,693 --> 01:48:13,612
They're a rare sight these days though.

1218
01:48:17,532 --> 01:48:19,075
Are you listening?

1219
01:48:19,159 --> 01:48:21,578
Argh! What's wrong with this phone?

1220
01:48:25,707 --> 01:48:26,708
Ta-da!

1221
01:48:27,417 --> 01:48:29,878
-Isn't it great? Come here, come here.
-Hmm?

1222
01:48:29,961 --> 01:48:31,171
Let's take a selfie.

1223
01:48:32,631 --> 01:48:34,382
One, two and three.

1224
01:48:40,847 --> 01:48:42,599
Kwon Yang-rae
was getting better,

1225
01:48:42,682 --> 01:48:44,559
so what triggered him to re-offend, huh?

1226
01:48:45,852 --> 01:48:48,146
We have to find out
what awakened his monster.

1227
01:48:51,650 --> 01:48:53,068
Kwon Yang-rae's trigger.

1228
01:48:56,905 --> 01:48:58,073
Yes, Inspector Lee.

1229
01:48:58,156 --> 01:49:00,575
-Did you see the photo I sent?
-A photo?

1230
01:49:00,659 --> 01:49:02,536
Kwon Yang-rae's "one-eyed monster,"

1231
01:49:02,619 --> 01:49:04,496
it's a house with a circular window.

1232
01:49:04,579 --> 01:49:07,290
Check the street view
of Redevelopment Zone Four

1233
01:49:07,374 --> 01:49:10,335
and find a house with a window like that.
That's where A-yeong is.

1234
01:49:10,418 --> 01:49:11,336
Got it.

1235
01:49:18,176 --> 01:49:20,053
Find a building
with a circular window like this

1236
01:49:20,136 --> 01:49:21,638
in Redevelopment Zone Four. ASAP.

1237
01:49:21,721 --> 01:49:23,848
-Roger that!
-On it. Send us the photo.

1238
01:49:55,797 --> 01:49:56,756
This is it.

1239
01:49:59,551 --> 01:50:01,970
DETECTIVE SO EUN-GYU:
23-7 MINDEULRE-GIL

1240
01:51:02,405 --> 01:51:03,657
Hey! What's your problem?

1241
01:51:27,972 --> 01:51:29,766
Wait, hold on.

1242
01:51:30,266 --> 01:51:31,643
Hang in there, okay?

1243
01:51:39,401 --> 01:51:40,902
I kept telling myself

1244
01:51:41,736 --> 01:51:45,740
that someone would come and save me.

1245
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:54,165
It's all right.
You're safe, you're all right.

1246
01:51:57,210 --> 01:51:58,586
You're okay.

1247
01:52:53,641 --> 01:52:54,809
Mr. Sung Min-chan.

1248
01:52:56,352 --> 01:52:59,439
We found her. We found Shin A-yeong.

1249
01:53:02,233 --> 01:53:04,861
You found… her remains, you mean?

1250
01:53:08,198 --> 01:53:09,199
Actually,

1251
01:53:09,949 --> 01:53:11,284
we found her alive.

1252
01:53:12,494 --> 01:53:14,662
She's being treated in the hospital.

1253
01:53:15,455 --> 01:53:17,999
She's still traumatized by everything…

1254
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:20,126
but there is hope.

1255
01:53:21,878 --> 01:53:23,588
Her doctor said she'll be okay.

1256
01:53:30,678 --> 01:53:31,888
That can't be right.

1257
01:53:35,475 --> 01:53:37,310
I swear I was told that she died.

1258
01:53:39,103 --> 01:53:40,021
Who told you that?

1259
01:53:42,482 --> 01:53:43,483
Pardon me?

1260
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,986
You just said that
you were told that she died.

1261
01:53:48,321 --> 01:53:49,322
Who told you?
