00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,170
Halt!

5
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:03,880
Mr. Su,

6
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,500
the road ahead is destroyed

7
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,260
and impassable.

8
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,280
Miss Shu,

9
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:09,650
the post road ahead is destroyed.

10
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:10,669
We need to delay for a while.

11
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,750
Mr. Su...

12
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,720
Cut the crap.

13
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,180
Jin.

14
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:16,980
I-I didn't say anything.

15
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,870
Am I so annoying to him?

16
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,210
I guess he’s still mad about the raw silk purchase yesterday.

17
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,610
Today is probably not gonna be a quiet day.

18
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:25,610
Sure.

19
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,070
Do you have a plan?

20
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:30,520
The sword is ruthless, while prowess is all that matters.

21
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,530
You two are my plan.

22
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,950
The truth you've been waiting for 15 years

23
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,610
is worse than you can imagine.

24
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,400
Love and hatred are all born from human hearts.

25
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,940
Only those who get rid of them can enter the Yuntai Sect.

26
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,800
Yun Xiang,

27
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,700
you still can't let it go.

28
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,980
And you still wanna investigate it, huh?

29
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:03,410
Luo is my family name.

30
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,540
I'm Luo Wenjia.

31
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,860
Do you feel cold?

32
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,770
We are like brothers.

33
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,480
So don't mind it.

34
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:22,170
What do you expect him to do?

35
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,630
He knew something would happen tonight,

36
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,340
while he still fell asleep in peace.

37
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,750
That makes me feel much better.

38
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:35,700
You should boast some martial arts skills.

39
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,530
If someone breaks in tonight,

40
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,080
do you need my help?

41
00:04:42,730 --> 00:04:43,720
I've seen you use your moving technique.

42
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:47,659
Ordinary people couldn't have dodged those bolts.

43
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,770
To be honest with you,

44
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,080
once I use my moving technique,

45
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,460
you can't hurt me at all

46
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,140
even if you and Jin work together.

47
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,120
In this case,

48
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,490
why did you ask us to protect you?

49
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,300
Just because there's a little flaw in this moving technique.

50
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,010
For example?

51
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,010
How can I show my fatal flaw to others so easily?

52
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:24,930
Mr. Su,

53
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,040
come here to warm yourself up.

54
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,690
This

55
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,100
is enough.

56
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,270
You ruined my plan yesterday.

57
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:45,730
Take this as punishment.

58
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,140
I think, even if he didn't stop you,

59
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,580
the steward by your side

60
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:02,990
might not follow your wish either.

61
00:06:05,650 --> 00:06:06,700
If I insisted,

62
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,290
Qian couldn't stop me.

63
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,140
The Su family has been the royal supplier for over a decade

64
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,190
as a big and wealthy clan.

65
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,030
You must be acting so absurdly

66
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,940
for some reason, right?

67
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,630
You thought you were smart and said something

68
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,360
to fulfill your own wish.

69
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:23,100
But what you said

70
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,480
will get others into a lot of trouble.

71
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,520
Then how about you explain it to us?

72
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,290
So I can know what I did wrong.

73
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:42,640
After my father passed away,

74
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,430
the Su family's business in the Nandu Chamber of Commerce

75
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,520
has been managed by my sister alone.

76
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,659
But I'm the only son of my father.

77
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:54,000
My sister wants me to take over it anxiously.

78
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,780
This time, I came to Yangzhou to buy silk.

79
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:57,790
Firstly,

80
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:00,790
she wanted me to gain some experience.

81
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,780
I did have some personal business,

82
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,180
and I wanted to make some money.

83
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,560
Well,

84
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:07,470
I was supposed to make a deal with them soon

85
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,740
and have some fun,

86
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,290
so my sister's wish could be fulfilled.

87
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:13,480
Who knew you'd get in the way?

88
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:17,360
The Su family is already the head of merchants.

89
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,830
Why don't you go into business?

90
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,470
Merchants... I've seen too many merchants.

91
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,520
Only two types of people will dig into business.

92
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,640
Profiteers,

93
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:32,340
and those who have no other way out.

94
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,090
So boring.

95
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,300
So you must be an ambitious person, Mr. Su.

96
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:38,790
Of course.

97
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:42,409
I aim to travel around the world with a sword.

98
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,780
If I can learn the best of all schools

99
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,930
and become a grand master,

100
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,040
isn't that good?

101
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,470
Shut up!

102
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,030
There come some villains!

103
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,070
Let's get closer.

104
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,020
Don't panic.

105
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,100
Martial arts are not learned with the mouth. Learn more skills.

106
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,220
Let's go.

107
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:40,610
Go after them!

108
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,400
Do not protect me.

109
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,980
Violators will be fined three months' wages.

110
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:56,990
Make way!

111
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,460
Catch up with her!

112
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:15,910
Qian.

113
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:16,660
Young Master,

114
00:09:17,110 --> 00:09:18,830
you don't need to handle these guys.

115
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,820
What moving technique is this?

116
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,360
I've never seen it before.

117
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,010
He can make a way out when surrounded on all sides.

118
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,730
Looks like this guy wasn't bragging.

119
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,220
It's hard to break it even if the two of us work together.

120
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,260
How much longer do you wanna watch?

121
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,660
Just a little longer!

122
00:11:50,650 --> 00:11:51,610
It's enough. Please stop.

123
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,140
If you force me to fight,

124
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,630
you will die for sure!

125
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,510
Help!

126
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,340
Help me!

127
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,680
The technique will stop working after ten breaths.

128
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:28,740
So this is the fatal flaw.

129
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:31,930
If you wanna test my martial arts,

130
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,010
I'll tell you after you ask me a few more times.

131
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,750
You don't have to kill me.

132
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,590
If I didn't go that far,

133
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,220
would you tell me honestly?

134
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:42,540
And you!

135
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,180
You didn't well protect your master, you know?

136
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,930
Does your useless technique have a name?

137
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,650
Run for Ten Breaths.

138
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:52,670
Pardon?

139
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,460
Run for Ten Breaths!

140
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,300
Mr. Yun,

141
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:19,740
have you ever seen these guys?

142
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,430
Mr. Qian, did you find out who these villains are?

143
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,570
As long as you're safe, Mr. Yun.

144
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,040
I saw it clearly tonight.

145
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,400
These people are not bandits.

146
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:36,170
They just targeted you.

147
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:40,430
If they were bandits,

148
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,150
they would have hidden by day and come out by night,

149
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,370
whose skin wouldn't be so dark.

150
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,370
Look.

151
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,200
Water ringworm.

152
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,980
They have solid shoulders and thick thighs.

153
00:13:55,110 --> 00:13:56,410
It's caused by years of weight bearing.

154
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:04,580
Could they be the members of the Cao Sect?

155
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,100
The Cao Sect

156
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,730
could have safely escorted us to the Nandu Wharf.

157
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,460
But they kept refusing.

158
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,850
So we had to take this remote post road.

159
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:19,480
Mr. Yun,

160
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,580
do you have a grudge against the Cao Sect?

161
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,490
If you think this is the truth,

162
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:31,330
then just let it be.

163
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:38,380
Jin,

164
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,010
your swordplay looks so fierce.

165
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,180
I once thought you inherited it from the Wu family in Nandu.

166
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,490
But the Wus' swordplay, Twelve Hanging-rock Techniques,

167
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,200
is mainly about flawless attacks,

168
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,460
not winning by speed.

169
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,430
But I saw you attacking three persons

170
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,740
at lightning speed.

171
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,870
I'm just a swordsman. I have nothing to do with the inheritance.

172
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,360
I just have travelled a lot and seen a lot.

173
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,220
You're right.

174
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,720
Your swordplay

175
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,740
boasts the trait of the Liu family in Yuezhou.

176
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,580
But the Lius' swordplay

177
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,640
is like a steady downpour of rain.

178
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:11,890
What's the point of these fancy names?

179
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:12,900
The swordplay

180
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,470
is used to kill people.

181
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,450
Nope, Jin.

182
00:15:19,230 --> 00:15:21,170
Knowing yourself and your enemy, you can fight a hundred battles and win them all.

183
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,440
Your swordplay seems quite sharp,

184
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,500
but it's not flawless.

185
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:26,670
Not flawless?

186
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:28,930
Go ahead.

187
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:33,870
This sword

188
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,390
isn't used to win by speed.

189
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,980
Your swordplay is similar to the Downpour Swordplay

190
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:40,010
of the Liu family.

191
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,680
It seems that the point is the sword.

192
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,450
But in fact, the power comes from the legs.

193
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:46,740
From the legs to the waist, then to the hands, then to the sword.

194
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,310
So to use this Downpour Swordplay,

195
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:49,740
the point is to protect the lower body.

196
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
But when you use it, you move a lot

197
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:53,860
and completely ignore the defence...

198
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:55,160
Forget it...

199
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,360
No one has seen through it, while you pointed it out.

200
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,180
Well...

201
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,610
You just kept talking without fighting anyone.

202
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,610
Jin! Jin!

203
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,930
It's not that I don't wanna help you.

204
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,620
I just thought...

205
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,150
I didn't expect you to be really capable like that.

206
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:09,760
Miss Shu.

207
00:16:10,410 --> 00:16:10,770
By the way,

208
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,240
the swordplay you use

209
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,580
seems so tricky,

210
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:15,180
but indeed it's all about defence, not attack.

211
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,170
When the enemy's defence is broken,

212
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:18,450
you'll give them a fatal blow.

213
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,400
It reminds me of Nandu Shu family's Altair Swordplay.

214
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,030
Yes.

215
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,070
Are you dumb?

216
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:25,720
Isn't her surname Shu?

217
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,160
Just a coincidence.

218
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,520
I guess so.

219
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,350
I heard that there's no inheritor

220
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,380
of the Shu family's swordplay now.

221
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,270
But your moving technique is also amazing.

222
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:39,860
I think I've seen it somewhere before.

223
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,960
It seems to be the lost technique of the Golden Wing Secret Agent in the previous dynasty.

224
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:48,230
Right, here you are.

225
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,560
Mr. Su,

226
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,540
when will the caravan depart?

227
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:55,900
Miss Shu, Jin,

228
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,770
we really hit it off, and it's a pleasure chatting with you.

229
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,820
When we arrive in Nandu, let me treat you

230
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,060
to something interesting.

231
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,610
Nice...

232
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,500
I've been there several times, but I've never done much sightseeing yet.

233
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,210
Good idea.

234
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,880
Then that's a deal.

235
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:10,369
-Okay. -Okay.

236
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,329
Hurry up!

237
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,790
[Nice Weather]

238
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:20,650
This way! Here!

239
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:21,290
Lend me a hand!

240
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,300
Chief Zhang,

241
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,180
how can you apologize to your master?

242
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,520
Master, I underestimated him.

243
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,930
I didn't expect him to be surrounded by top martial arts masters.

244
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:39,560
The tea house just sent it to us.

245
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,590
They said the tea leaves were picked this morning.

246
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,430
I guess you'll like it.

247
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,560
How many of our men died?

248
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,620
S-Seventeen.

249
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:50,850
Bury them well.

250
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,480
Yes, Master.

251
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:52,790
Master,

252
00:17:53,150 --> 00:17:54,270
please give me one more chance

253
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:55,400
to make up for my mistake.

254
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,320
If I fail,

255
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,060
I'll kill myself for it.

256
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,690
Zhang Kui,

257
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,910
this is the last time.

258
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:16,980
He's dead.

259
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:18,560
We've verified it.

260
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,370
It's true.

261
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:28,880
-Mr. Qian. -Mr.Qian.

262
00:18:29,490 --> 00:18:30,420
Where is our lady?

263
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,700
In the backyard study.

264
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:47,670
My lady.

265
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,680
[Su Huairou from the Su Family in Nandu]

266
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,240
You've brought back the raw silk, huh?

267
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:01,110
Yes, we've brought it all back

268
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:03,060
and stored it in the Yufeng Warehouse.

269
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:04,960
Thank you for your hard work.

270
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,450
My lady,

271
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:09,140
why didn't you wait for me

272
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,200
to come back and handle this tiring work?

273
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:13,390
If I didn't calculate it myself today,

274
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:15,370
I wouldn't know how hard your work is.

275
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,310
My lady,

276
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,180
you've been so engaged in the affairs of the Chamber of Commerce.

277
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,160
So please don't waste your time

278
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,870
on the chores of our mansion.

279
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,770
Where's Mingyu? Why hasn't he come back?

280
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:35,010
[Liansheng House]

281
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:42,630
[Liansheng House]

282
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,110
Liansheng House?

283
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,430
So magnificent.

284
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,620
Mr. Su, so the first stop on your return

285
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,920
is a gambling house.

286
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:48,590
Mr. Su, you have such a wide range of hobbies.

287
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,410
Why are you still following us?

288
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,570
Stop arguing. It's a waste of time.

289
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,500
Let's go...

290
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:55,720
Go...

291
00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:57,760
Let's go inside to take a look.

292
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:09,760
Mr. Su,

293
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,280
there are so few people here.

294
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,050
Why don't you find a more bustling place to have fun?

295
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,520
Please forgive me, Jin.

296
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:15,630
To be honest with you,

297
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,140
this Liansheng House is gonna be auctioned tomorrow.

298
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,430
I'm just in a hurry to meet a friend of mine.

299
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,920
Gambling is the same wherever you are.

300
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,090
[Ke Menglan from the Liansheng House]

301
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,350
Guys,

302
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,310
place and finalize your bets.

303
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:49,210
All in.

304
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,220
Mr. Qi, are you skipping this round?

305
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:53,780
The Liansheng House will be auctioned tomorrow.

306
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,740
You'd better think carefully.

307
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,730
Mr. Qi, as I told you,

308
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,810
eleven on the left, and eleven on the right.

309
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,700
It's a draw.

310
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,850
The banker takes all.

311
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,010
-I lost again... -I lost again.

312
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:07,770
You still have a few hours to think about it.

313
00:21:08,050 --> 00:21:09,840
If nothing was gonna change in the Liansheng House,

314
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,590
I wouldn't have persuaded you to follow me.

315
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,220
But the Tangs' Gambling House has already said,

316
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,580
if you're auctioned off to the Tang family,

317
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,060
then...

318
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,160
I want your seat.

319
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:20,980
Are you kidding me?

320
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,680
It's you, Mr. Su.

321
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:33,650
Sit down please,

322
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:34,770
Mr. Su.

323
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:35,320
Jin.

324
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,300
Here you are.

325
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,300
Okay.

326
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,900
This girl looks so beautiful.

327
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:44,880
I haven't gambled for days.

328
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,050
I quite miss it.

329
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,370
Menglan,

330
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,390
Jin is my friend.

331
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,360
Please go easy on him.

332
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,090
Nonsense!

333
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,240
When did I ever lose?

334
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,830
Girl, don't listen to him!

335
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,860
Just show me what you've got.

336
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:17,190
Do you know this Liansheng House

337
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,220
used to be Godfather's property?

338
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,020
Come on...

339
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:29,460
Place the bet here.

340
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:30,500
Where to place the bet?

341
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,090
I choose this!

342
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,170
It's rare to have a place to relax.

343
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,880
Why do you have so much on your mind?

344
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:43,880
I'm wondering

345
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:46,380
why Su Mingyu

346
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,270
happened to bring us here.

347
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:49,680
Don't bother thinking about it.

348
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,410
A day without her

349
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,910
can make him miss her like crazy.

350
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,600
The story between a young master of a noble family and a female croupier in a gambling house.

351
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:04,930
Sounds great in a novel,

352
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,040
but it's hard in real life.

353
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,530
Godfather owned businesses

354
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,980
all over Nandu in his prime.

355
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,030
It was so glorious.

356
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:20,990
But once he lost power,

357
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,350
the merchants in Nandu were like wolves devouring a tiger.

358
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,630
Soon, this Liansheng House became the only one left.

359
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,270
Even this will also disappear, I'm afraid.

360
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:35,970
Not necessarily.

361
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,780
What does saving Liansheng House have to do

362
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,410
with your revenge?

363
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,910
What exactly is the purpose of your trip this time?

364
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:50,800
Miss Shu,

365
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,610
can you first tell me

366
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,900
who is qualified to learn the moving technique

367
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,070
of the Golden Wing Secret Agent in the previous dynasty?

368
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,560
As far as I know, this technique can only be learned...

369
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:04,680
Yes, only in the Lingyuan Sect.

370
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,620
You admit that you're a Lingyuan rebel?

371
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,750
Three years ago, I once travelled to Ganzhou

372
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:16,070
and saved a dying Lingyuan Sect member.

373
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,160
The secret skills of the Lingyuan Sect are never passed on to outsiders.

374
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:24,790
He probably tried to lure me to join the Lingyuan Sect.

375
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:26,080
Did you

376
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:28,060
learn their martial arts

377
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,210
and then find a chance to run away?

378
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,150
Exactly.

379
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:35,950
Wait.

380
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,780
Haven't you been determined to take revenge on Qi Tianfeng?

381
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:42,570
Why didn't you join them

382
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,120
after you learned the skills of the Lingyuan Sect?

383
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,500
Your Yuntai Sect has a feud with the Lingyuan Sect.

384
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:48,230
If I joined the Lingyuan Sect,

385
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:49,990
how could I face Godfather again?

386
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,520
Flawless.

387
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,380
The imperial court also sees the Yuntai Sect as a big threat,

388
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,980
while you didn't hide your identity at all.

389
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,220
It makes me sort of suspicious.

390
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:07,890
What?

391
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,260
If you wanted to turn me in, you wouldn't have waited until today.

392
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,650
Why do you think I have mercy on you?

393
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,980
You have both eyes for me.

394
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:23,050
See more carefully now.

395
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,540
The figure is slightly distorted,

396
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:40,990
but the face is still outstanding.

397
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,340
Don't flatter yourself.

398
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,650
No girls will like your words.

399
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,780
Are you playing tricks with me?

400
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:53,870
Jin,

401
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,630
take a rest if you have bad luck for now.

402
00:25:59,320 --> 00:25:59,950
Wait.

403
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,450
Why didn't you place any bets

404
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,340
after I got to the table?

405
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,310
We wanna tell the trend through you, of course.

406
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,320
Bro, although you look kind of silly,

407
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,200
you're so strong.

408
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:14,960
Girl,

409
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:16,570
can I pay on credit?

410
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,860
We usually don't allow that.

411
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,180
But since you're Mr. Su's friend...

412
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:24,960
No, Menglan.

413
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:25,760
Stay out of this.

414
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,030
Jin, you lost 30 taels.

415
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,660
Then I can give you 30 taels on credit,

416
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,190
until you win them back. How about that?

417
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:34,900
Wonderful!

418
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,400
He's fond of gambling but not good at it.

419
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:40,870
That's really a vice.

420
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:43,160
I was just thinking about how to keep him by my side.

421
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:44,360
This is a good chance.

422
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,560
You wanna take advantage of his weakness, yet you sound so proud.

423
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,720
Are all the Yuntai members

424
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,190
so shameless?

425
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,920
Use some shameless tricks

426
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,860
to achieve something great and honorable.

427
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,780
This is similar to how you learned

428
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,190
the martial arts of the Lingyuan Sect.

429
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,450
You've come for more than revenge, right?

430
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:06,920
Yes,

431
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:09,610
or not.

432
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,590
You're full of lies.

433
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,000
You want me to team up with you?

434
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:14,860
Just forget about that.

435
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,360
Sir and Madam, please have some tea first.

436
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:24,620
Just leave this to me.

437
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,770
Don't come unless I ask you to.

438
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:29,700
Thank you, sir.

439
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:37,540
Miss,

440
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,260
you're really smart.

441
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,300
You're right.

442
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,200
I do have other plans.

443
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:44,820
But I wasn't lying when I proposed

444
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:46,900
to deal with Qi Tianfeng.

445
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,070
How can I trust you?

446
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,410
Within this month,

447
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,600
I'll destroy Qi Tianfeng

448
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:58,240
and his Cao Sect.

449
00:27:59,670 --> 00:28:00,350
Your departure or stay is up to you.

450
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,020
But if you decide to join hands with me,

451
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,730
I need you to promise me one thing.

452
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,020
Go ahead.

453
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,740
You and I do our part and complement each other.

454
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:10,470
But please don't ask the reason

455
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:11,820
for my commission.

456
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,100
When it's done,

457
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:14,710
if you still don't understand,

458
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,900
I'll explain it to you.

459
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,220
Deal.

460
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:22,800
But I have a blood feud.

461
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:24,690
If you change your mind halfway,

462
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,010
your Run for Ten Breaths,

463
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,270
or even Run for A Hundred Breaths...

464
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,000
I know.

465
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,910
You'll show me no mercy.

466
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:32,740
When did you ever show mercy?

467
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,620
You deserve it for talking nonsense.

468
00:28:36,930 --> 00:28:38,280
No more jokes. Let's get down to business.

469
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,240
Now, the merchants in Nandu

470
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,440
are ready to divide up Mr. Wen's business.

471
00:28:43,510 --> 00:28:44,400
But you should know that

472
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,730
it's usually about a series of debts in business.

473
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:48,720
There were some debts Mr. Wen owed them,

474
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,430
and some they owed Mr. Wen, of course.

475
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:54,050
Are you gonna collect all the debts?

476
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:55,930
Exactly. Thank you, Miss.

477
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,620
But Mr. Wen has passed away.

478
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,740
Who would admit their debts?

479
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,460
That depends on your tactics.

480
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:05,810
This thing matters a lot.

481
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:06,930
There's no time to waste.

482
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,040
You'd better set off right away.

483
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:28,000
You may soon run into lots of hard nuts to crack.

484
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:29,660
Be careful.

485
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,660
What's the use of just talking?

486
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:32,860
How about we go together?

487
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:53,650
Jin,

488
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,130
black or red?

489
00:29:56,410 --> 00:29:57,100
Black or red?

490
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,250
You tell me!

491
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,360
How would I know?

492
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:01,980
So useless!

493
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,050
Still red!

494
00:30:09,730 --> 00:30:10,270
Okay.

495
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,000
Hold on!

496
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,450
Let me take a closer look.

497
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,420
Black, 14.

498
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,600
18, 18, 18...

499
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:23,840
18, 18, 18!

500
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:27,820
Red, 12.

501
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:29,550
Black wins.

502
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,950
Sir,

503
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:36,130
you lost and borrowed 60 taels in total.

504
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,560
If you lose all the money, do you need our help?

505
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,780
I'm gonna kill you, you know?

506
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,670
Don't worry, Jin.

507
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:45,210
You still have me to cover

508
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:46,340
your daily expenses these days.

509
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,360
You lost and borrowed 60 taels of gold in total, huh?

510
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,160
How long do you have to stay in the Sus' mansion

511
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:50,940
to make up for this money?

512
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,680
Why are you so sarcastic again?

513
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:56,900
Mr. Su,

514
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:58,270
you brought Jin to the gambling house

515
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,820
on the first stop in Nandu, huh?

516
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:10,150
You two set me up!

517
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,300
Jin, I didn't.

518
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,740
Jin, you must be joking.

519
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,770
In front of everyone,

520
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:19,940
I

521
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,490
dare not gamble with the reputation of the Liansheng House.

522
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:27,740
Yeah.

523
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:30,800
You don't need to play any tricks against him.

524
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,250
I'm gonna kill you if you insult me again,

525
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:34,550
for free.

526
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,620
It's 60 taels of gold,

527
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:38,430
the money for killing 6 people.

528
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:41,720
Are you willing to donate it to the gambling house for nothing?

529
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,110
Who on earth are you siding with?

530
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,300
Miss,

531
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,810
I still have 60 taels left.

532
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:51,660
Can I play a game with you?

533
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:52,790
Just one round to decide the winner.

534
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,280
Let's bet on the 60 taels of gold he just lost.

535
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,710
How do you want to play it?

536
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,350
You and I each hold a cup.

537
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:02,210
If we get the same number after the opening, I win.

538
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,920
If not, you win.

539
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:05,590
How about that?

540
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,260
Menglan, don't play it with him.

541
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,480
This man's so cunning.

542
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,780
Okay, let's play as you say.

543
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,450
Guys,

544
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,090
please keep quiet.

545
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,290
This gambling game

546
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:31,100
all depends on listening.

547
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:32,720
Thank you.

548
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:49,270
After you, Miss.

549
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:35,770
It's your turn, sir.

550
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:03,940
I'm done.

551
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:06,890
Can that work?

552
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,850
-He didn't shake it! -He didn't  
 even shake it!

553
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:17,929
Red, 10

554
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:19,400
It's 10.

555
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:22,080
Black...

556
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,219
You are so lucky, sir.

557
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:47,260
I lost.

558
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:52,690
Jin.

559
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:10,860
How many more unique skills do you have?

560
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,480
Yun Xiang! Yun Xiang!

561
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,540
Yun Xiang!

562
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:27,060
Fragrant bags, sachets, and pendants.

563
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:34,120
Give that to me. You've kept it for a long time.

564
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:34,580
What?

565
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,000
My 30 taels of gold!

566
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,640
Are you kidding me?

567
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:39,520
I won that money with my skill.

568
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,380
Besides, I even removed your debt

569
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:41,860
of 30 taels of gold.

570
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:42,720
You...

571
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:43,700
Jin,

572
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,270
as a great warrior,

573
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,620
you won't play dumb with me, will you?

574
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:50,490
Do you have any enemies?

575
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,330
I'll kill a few for you, at half price.

576
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,430
Then how about this?

577
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,530
You condescend to follow me for some days,

578
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,000
and I pay you 1 tael of gold every day, huh?

579
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:03,090
You tricked me.

580
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,780
I know you've worked so hard

581
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,580
in the past few days.

582
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,250
Take this money,

583
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,570
and find an inn to have a good rest.

584
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,080
What do you mean?

585
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,760
You don't need me now?

586
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,060
I hope you get killed by the Cao Sect!

587
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,240
[Servant Girl, Tianhu]

588
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:58,500
Are you worried about the auction?

589
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,160
We'll know the result tomorrow.

590
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,380
Now, the only person we can rely on

591
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,120
is Mr. Su.

592
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:18,360
Menglan.

593
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,540
Don't be sad.

594
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,020
The auction is tomorrow.

595
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,840
No matter how much you win today, it's hard to change the situation.

596
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,940
I know, of course.

597
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,590
I just want Tianhu and the others

598
00:37:39,630 --> 00:37:40,460
to lead a better life.

599
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,930
Tang Xiao can't take Liansheng House away

600
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,230
Look, I've saved 3,000 taels of silver.

601
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,170
I'm sure I can win it at tomorrow's auction.

602
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,110
Thank you for your kindness, Mr. Su.

603
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:57,420
But could you please be more prudent when you say anything in the future?

604
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,540
You once promised you'd ask Chairman Su

605
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,020
to stop Tang Xiao from bidding.

606
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,160
Did you do it?

607
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,660
-Menglan... -I guess you tried,

608
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:13,170
but Chairman Su refused.

609
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:22,010
I know you don't mind my menial background.

610
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,950
But how can the Su family accept it?

611
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,500
So please

612
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,220
don't waste your time, sir.

613
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,650
Menglan. Menglan!

614
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:36,240
Time will prove my sincerity.

615
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,100
Tomorrow...

616
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,040
I'll protect Liansheng House tomorrow.

Please keep it well.

619
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,630
I wanna deposit this.

620
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:25,860
Liu,

621
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:26,990

622
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:27,860
This way, please.

623
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:28,910
Please.

624
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,680
Mr. Wang, this way, please.

625
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,220
This way, please.

626
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,010
Sir, we only do business with regular customers on the list.

627
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:47,270
No deposit or withdrawal for other customers.

628

I do have an account here.

but I've never seen you before, sir.

00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,270
May I have your account name?
