[Episode 9 The Heart-breaking Past]

4
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,990
I thought you would be the one

5
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,539
talking up there.

6
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,340
The plan is set.

7
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,070
It doesn't matter who comes forward.

8
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,930
It's rare that Mingyu cares about our family affairs so much.

9
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,820
This is a good time to train him.

10
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,640
We can also take this chance

11
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,210
to get to know the merchants.

12
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,950
You never blink at any catastrophe.

13
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,900
I really admire your charisma, Chairman Su.

14
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,650
Once the deeds of 80,000 catties of raw silk are sold,

15
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,870
the silk price will not rise

16
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,450
but fall by 30%.

17
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,110
So it can stabilize the silk market in Nandu.

18
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:22,300
If the raw silk can be sent back successfully,

19
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,810
all problems will be solved.

20
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,240
If not...

21
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,579
Peculiar tactics always help people

22
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,430
win a battle or make a fortune.

23
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,780
Only those who dare to gamble can win.

24
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:44,670
Qian,

25
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,200
we've already given up a lot of interest.

26
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,810
Why are they still hesitating?

27
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,610
Do as Lady Su said.

28
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,300
It'll definitely work.

29
00:02:58,930 --> 00:02:59,280
Guys.

30
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:00,750
Guys!

31
00:03:01,950 --> 00:03:02,830
As you all know,

32
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,830
we, the Su family, used to ship silk

33
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,320
all by water.

34
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,530
But now, the Cao Sect

35
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,720
has stopped all the cargo ships from Yangzhou to Nandu.

36
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,300
I think you are worried that

37
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,040
it'll be hard to honour the deeds

38
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,220
if the raw silk can't be sent into the city.

39
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:20,900
But in business,

40
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,170
the first is to keep your word,

41
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,350
the second is to be faithful,

42
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,880
and the last is to seek profits.

43
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,510
Our Su family has been royal suppliers for a century,

44
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:30,960
and we're always trustworthy.

45
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,760
We chose water transport

46
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,900
because delivering by post roads took a longer time

47
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,310
and cost more.

48
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,850
But the recent rise in the silk price

49
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,329
balances the cost.

50
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,050
The post roads are the best choice now.

51
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:44,990
Of course,

52
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,900
you might think the bandits are rampant on the post roads.

53
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,820
We Su family has paid a lot

54
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,600
to hire the prestigious Four Armed Escort Agencies

55
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,040
to ensure the safety of the goods.

56
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,670
And I, Su Mingyu,

57
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,870
will go escort the goods in person this time.

58
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,630
I swear with my life.

59
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:11,150
Young Master,

60
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:14,630
please don't talk recklessly again.

61
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,029
Mr. Qin,

62
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,709
could you read out the end of the deed

63
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,040
to everyone?

64
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:24,530
Yes.

65
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,750
The deal is closed with a cash purchase.

66
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,080
No registration, and free exchange.

67
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:34,710
Well...

68
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,270
The raw silk price in Nandu has been soaring,

69
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,120
just because someone's storing it to sell it

70
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:40,790
at a higher price.

71
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,240
We merchants all speak from a business standpoint.

72
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,420
So Chairman Su has no intention of accusing you.

73
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,550
But the Chamber of Commerce is responsible for keeping the price down.

74
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,200
So Chairman Su decided that

75
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,440
the deeds could be traded freely.

76
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,280
Now, our price is still two taels per catty.

77
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:03,990
-I want it... -I want one.

78
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,800
-Me too... -Me too...

79
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,120
[Deed]

80
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:12,120
[Two taels of silver per catty of raw silk. 80,000 catties in total. Delivery within 15 days.]

81
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:11,100
The deeds of 80,000 catties of raw silk

82
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,350
have been mostly sold.

83
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,030
Once this stuff's gaining ground,

84
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,870
the price of raw silk will surely plummet

85
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,110
by around 30%.

86
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:19,570
Master,

87
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,790
we spent over 100,000 taels of silver

88
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,310
and stored 50,000 catties of raw silk.

89
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,380
It's time to dump it.

90
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,660
We can make half the profit if we dump at this time.

91
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,460
It’s quite safe for our Cao Sect.

92
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,280
You would make a name for yourself in this battle.

93
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:35,930
And in the future, no one in Nandu

94
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,350
will dare to look down

95
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:39,990
on our Cao Sect, including that Tang Xiao.

96
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,720
You know what I want.

97
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:48,710
Master,

98
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,150
we have ample time.

99
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,580
Why don’t we achieve it step by step?

100
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,420
The plan of deeds is already the Su family's final counterattack.

101
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:00,390
We'd better just give up

102
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,930
this Pyrrhic victory.

103
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,290
Ding Yi,

104
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,090
I'm thinking about something.

105
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,850
Su Huairou is a business genius,

106
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,920
but this plan of deeds

107
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,540
is not what she normally uses.

108
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,430
Last night,

109
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,910
Qian Rong invited Yun Xiang into Su's Mansion.

110
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,780
It’s him.

111
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,890
70% of the deeds of 80,000 catties of raw silk

112
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,610
have been sold in one day.

113
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,760
The Su family really lives up to its commercial reputation.

114
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,060
The more we sell, the greater the loss.

115
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,909
This is probably the biggest bet

116
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:38,030
our Su family has ever made.

117
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:39,950
Don't worry, Sister.

118
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,840
This time, I'd risk my life

119
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,230
to bring the raw silk back.

120
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,570
You can’t go.

121
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,780
Sister!

122
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,690
Not until this family calamity

123
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,200
did I realize how selfish I was.

124
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,500
I didn’t take any responsibility for the Su family before.

125
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,000
And I’ve been learning martial arts since my childhood.

126
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,350
The escort will be absolutely safe this time.

127
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,300
Stop messing around.

128
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,980
I’ve staked all the lives

129
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,240
of our Su family

130
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:04,550
to fight for the last chance.

131
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,760
I won't risk your life again.

132
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:10,820
Chairman Su,

133
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,630
Mr. Su just promised to escort in person

134
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,390
in front of

135
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,700
so many merchants.

136
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,510
If he goes back on his word now,

137
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,330
what will those merchants think?

138
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,580
What worries them the most today

139
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:24,810
is that this batch of raw silk can’t be shipped to Nandu,

140
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,470
and their deeds can't be honoured.

141
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,710
If Mr. Su goes to escort the goods in person,

142
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,410
on one hand,

143
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,590
it can show the confidence and determination of your Su family.

144
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,800
On the other hand, it can assure the merchants

145
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,970
that these deeds can be honoured in time.

146
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,960
In this case, you can both reassure people

147
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:45,780
and stabilize the price.

148
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:49,470
I know, of course.

149
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,670
I understand.

150
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,470
You're of the same blood.

151
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,560
How about this?

152
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,920
I'll send "Ten Taels of Gold" and Shu Yanan

153
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,440
to escort Mr. Su there.

154
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,650
Both of them are top martial arts masters

155
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,690
who risk their lives in the martial world.

156
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,100
Their escort

157
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,370
will keep Mr. Su safe and sound.

158
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:06,630
Yes, Sister.

159
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:07,760
Just rest assured.

160
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,340
Even though I'm not an invincible martial arts master,

161
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,690
I can still protect myself

162
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:11,710
when something happens.

163
00:08:15,350 --> 00:08:18,550
But are you not gonna have any guards by your side?

164
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,410
It's said the people of the Cao Sect have been trying

165
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,660
to get rid of you.

166
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,880
Qi Tianfeng is stocking up on raw silk right now.

167
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:29,090
His ambition is evident.

168
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,750
Chairman Su, I believe you already know

169
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,890
who he's targeting and trying to bring down.

170
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,040
My lady,

171
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,470
Ding Yi, the steward of Qi Tianfeng, is outside,

172
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,190
asking to see Yun Xiang.

173
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,910
Steward Ding of the Cao Sect has come.

174
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,330
He wants to see you.

175
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,460
Ding Yi?

176
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:01,890
It's about time he came.

177
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,130
How about this?

178
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:05,710
Just follow our previous arrangement,

179
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,710
and leave the rest to me.

180
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:28,350
Master Qi has prepared wonderful wine and dishes at Xianfu Restaurant.

181
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:30,060
We'd like to invite you to come.

182
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:31,890
May I have the chance

183
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,120
to enjoy this meal, too?

184
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,100
Master Qi only invited Mr. Yun.

185
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:38,260
Please forgive me for not making a decision by myself.

186
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,960
Don't make it difficult for him.

187
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:41,110
I'll just go with him.

188
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,590
Beware of tricks.

189
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,840
That would be more interesting.

190
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:48,760
Mr. Ding, please lead the way.

191
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,280
This way please, Mr. Yun.

192
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,110
Qian,

193
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,110
what should we do now?

194
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,240
In this situation,

195
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,640
Mr. Yun went to see Qi Tianfeng alone.

196
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,830
Young Master,

197
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,740
I'm afraid you've thought too much.

198
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,040
How can we figure out

199
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:16,130
the thoughts of someone like Yun Xiang?

200
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,560
You and I have fought several times.

201
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,270
And we finally meet each other today.

202
00:10:57,350 --> 00:10:58,190
In a battle between two armies,

203
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,180
there's no need for the commanders-in-chief to charge at the front.

204
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,100
Fragrant and soft as silk.

205
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,020
It's puffer meat.

206
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:39,870
Yes.

207
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,310
I've been suffering from a chronic illness.

208
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,710
Fortunately, I got a secret remedy.

209
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:46,950
Make soup with puffer meat

210
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,920
and heal with its slight poison.

211
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,660
How's the effect?

212
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,140
I've recovered 70%.

213
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,190
The Iron Hand Demon with 70% power

214
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,520
is already invincible in Nandu.

215
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:06,490
My internal injury was not caused by anyone else,

216
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,250
but by my overly fierce palm technique

217
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:10,890
which has hurt my meridians.

218
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,140
There's also a fatal flaw in the strange moving technique

219
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,880
you just used, I guess.

220
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:20,700
Judging from your breath, you don't look like

221
00:12:21,110 --> 00:12:22,470
someone with a powerful internal force.

222
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:27,820
I guess it consumes a lot of internal force,

223
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,160
or it can't last long.

224
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:36,160
My moving technique can only last 10 breaths.

225
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,310
You told me your fatal flaw yourself.

226
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:47,020
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you?

227
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,000
To kill me,

228
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,170
you didn't have to go through all this trouble.

229
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:55,790
Master Qi,

230
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,030
let’s just get to the point.

231
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,850
You remind me

232
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,820
of how Wen Cong used to be when he just came to Nandu.

233
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:18,050
I'm afraid it’s inappropriate

234
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:19,860
to mention Mr. Wen so flippantly.

235
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:22,450
Did the Yuntai Sect send you to take revenge?

236
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:23,840
Yes,

237
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,060
or no.

238
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,110
Is it also your idea

239
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,830
to let the Su family sell the deeds?

240
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:33,500
Exactly.

241
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,150
You should know

242
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,070
I will never let the raw silk be delivered to the city.

243
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,850
Business is similar to martial arts.

244
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,740
If you use too much force,

245
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,230
it might backfire.

246
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,220
I heard the cruel Taotie was carved

247
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,590
on the bronze ware of the previous dynasty.

248
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,670
Taotie likes eating people.

249
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,080
But due to a miscalculation, it was stuffed

250
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,690
to death.

251
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,240
Master Qi,

252
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,880
the Su's business is not that easy to swallow in one gulp.

253
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,230
Am I the only one who resembles the Taotie?

254
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,020
If the Su family surrenders now,

255
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,310
they'll only lose their commercial reputation,

256
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,620
or at most the title of the royal supplier.

257
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:19,590
But now, by selling deeds,

258
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,400
they're betting on the Su family's century-old foundation.

259
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:25,160
You

260
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:28,710
pushed the Su family to their doom.

261
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,160
You'll wait until both the Cao Sect and the Su family

262
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,740
are about to lose,

263
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,410
so you can reap the benefits easily, right?

264
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,600
Don’t you also wanna kill two birds with one stone, Master Qi?

265
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,820
You wanna destroy the Su family and me,

266
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,630
and replace us.

267
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,990
I think we'd better call it a day.

268
00:15:04,110 --> 00:15:05,510
When everything's clear,

269
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:07,590
we'll meet again.

270
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:09,590
Okay.

271
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,420
[Liansheng House]

272
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,100
I knew you were an orphan.

273
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:37,830
But I thought you grew up in a charity.

274
00:15:39,710 --> 00:15:41,950
I was lucky and met a good person.

275
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:44,590
But what will happen to those kids?

276
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,520
I can't imagine.

277
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,740
Anyway, listen to me.

278
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,700
You can't find those kids

279
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,050
all by yourself.

280
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:56,730
He's coming.

281
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,240
The light went out.

282
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,030
I thought you all left me behind.

283
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:03,260
How's it? Where's Miss Ke?

284
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,320
Didn't you point the finger at her idleness?

285
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,810
She went to hire the head dealer and servants early in the morning.

286
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:09,510
Are you satisfied, Boss?

287
00:16:10,380 --> 00:16:11,180
This is the right way.

288
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,000
If you have nothing else to say,

289
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,280
don't get in the way of our drinking.

290
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,990
The Su's trade caravan will set off tomorrow.

291
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,970
This time

292
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:20,750
we've assembled the best armed escort agencies in Nandu,

293
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,220
whose members all have their unique techniques,

294
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,650
but I still think

295
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:28,740
we need a commander with unparalleled martial arts skills.

296
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:36,750
Jin,

297
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:38,680
in my heart,

298
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:40,630
you're the perfect choice.

299
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,600
According to the news spreading out there,

300
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,200
for the Su's trade caravan,

301
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:48,390
over ten gangs of bandits along the river have gathered.

302
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:50,860
In this fight,

303
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,990
how many people have I gotta kill?

304
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:53,770
As usual,

305
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,020
10 taels of gold per person.

306
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,070
What’s the current price of silk in Yangzhou?

307
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:00,450
One tael of silver for three catties of silk.

308
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,790
And what’s the price of the Sus' deeds?

309
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,270
Two taels of silver per catty of silk.

310
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,030
The Su family has sold deeds of 80,000 catties of raw silk.

311
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,270
After this delivery, they're gonna earn

312
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,710
at least 100,000 taels.

313
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,720
But even if I fight so hard and break my sword,

314
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:20,650
do you think I can earn 1,000 taels?

315
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,050
Then Jin, how about you name a price?

316
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,940
I don't want any remuneration.

317
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,400
But you must get all the children

318
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,190
of Jishan Hall back.

319
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,730
How can I find them?

320
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,030
Backed by the Yuntai Sect,

321
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,460
you can definitely figure out a way.

322
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:55,020
Why are you looking at her?

323
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,990
I already know you so well.

324
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,230
Maybe I can find them.

325
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,260
But if I bring back such a large group of orphans,

326
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,100
how should they be accommodated and raised?

327
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,370
And who will take care of them?

328
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:08,920
You.

329
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,980
You pay to rebuild the charity

330
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,470
and hire a teacher to teach them how to read

331
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:14,500
when they're old enough for that.

332
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:17,710
Those overachievers will find their way naturally,

333
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,060
while the others

334
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:21,990
can stay in this Liansheng House and work here

335
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,600
so that they won't starve to death.

336
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,240
What?

337
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,620
Do you think the price is too high?

338
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:31,770
Too high to reach.

339
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:33,470
Then just cut the crap,

340
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,330
and find someone else.

341
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:37,640
Commander Jin!

342
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,410
Pack your bags now.

343
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:44,140
Cheers!

344
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,070
You let Jin name such a high price to me.

345
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:05,340
What if I refuse?

346
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:07,030
You would agree no matter what price he asked for.

347
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:08,430
Ten Taels of Gold and I must both be there

348
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:09,860
for the Su family's business this time,

349
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,570
because you need to let Qi Tianfeng know

350
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,800
you've staked everything you have.

351
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:16,470
Have you told him all my arrangements?

352
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,100
I just wanna help him get those children back.

353
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:20,030
I'll keep my mouth shut about what I'm not supposed to say.

354
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,750
You're a fast learner in how to coerce people

355
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,630
in a smart way.

356
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,670
It's just an eye for an eye.

357
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,420
It's not that I didn't want to help.

358
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:49,030
But we need to prioritize the tasks, right?

359
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:50,960
So you do have some human touch.

360
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:53,450
Where have you been today?

361
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:54,620
Why are you back so late?

362
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,470
I went to Qi Tianfeng's banquet.

363
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,040
Qi Tianfeng?

364
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:14,990
Qi Tianfeng already knew

365
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,300
it was my idea to use the raw silk deeds.

366
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,140
He just wanted to sound out the facts.

367
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,230
And I also wanted to know

368
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:21,750
what his next move would be.

369
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,780
If he starts to dump the raw silk now,

370
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,190
we can only see him

371
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,360
escape unscathed.

372
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:28,990
Will he

373
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:30,840
dump it now?

374
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,300
He wants more than these penny profits.

375
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:06,760
What is this?

376
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,100
I wanted to test his martial arts skills.

377
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:13,550
And I got this by accident.

378
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,810
If he didn't come for revenge,

379
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:17,420
then he's stirred up trouble

380
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,830
just to do what Wen Cong failed to finish back then

381
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,630
and control the business world in Nandu.

382
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,100
Isn't it the usual tactic of the Yuntai Sect?

383
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:26,550
Master,

384
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,070
it will take a great deal of money

385
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,230
to raise the price of the deeds.

386
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,990
We have nowhere to borrow money now.

387
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:42,720
[Luo]

388
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:46,690
What's wrong with you?

389
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,390
You, Young Master Xiang, never blink at any disaster.

390
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,830
If you panic even a little,

391
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:17,190
that means something big has happened.

392
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,150
Tell me about it. Maybe I can help you.

393
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,430
Yes, you can.

394
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,530
Can you leave me alone? Thank you.

395
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:50,110
Look at this character.

396
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,330
Luo...

397
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,070
The Luo family's village?

398
00:22:56,710 --> 00:22:57,750
He’s from the Luo family's village!

399
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,950
I kept observing him during the meal.

400
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,150
Still, I was almost cheated by him.

401
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:06,640
This is the evidence.

402
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:11,100
Yun Xiang is here for revenge.

403
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:13,510
His personal revenge.

404
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,000
[Cao Sect]

405
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,950
I didn't expect it to be you.

406
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:46,670
It was quite powerful,

407
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,810
but not accurate.

408
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:57,000
You remain cool in the face of shock.

409
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,910
You're really not the crying little girl

410
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,770
you used to be.

411
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:29,030
The Altair Swordplay is the Shu family's orthodox technique.

412
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,970
Unfortunately, it's not top-class.

413
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:53,750
Girl,

414
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:55,510
if you try again,

415
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:58,190
I'm afraid I won't be interested.

416
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,460
Sit down and have some tea.

417
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:13,960
Maybe we can talk about the past.

418
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:24,900
Why are you laughing?

419
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:28,110
I'm laughing at my useless sympathy

420
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,060
for not killing you back then.

421
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:34,760
Wen Cong took over Shu's Armed Escort Agency.

422
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,750
He ordered me to kill you all.

423
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,240
My Godfather is dead.

424
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,310
Don't talk nonsense about him.

425
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:48,750
He destroyed your whole family,

426
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,240
while he adopted you as his daughter.

427
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,670
He wiped away the blood

428
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:57,340
and blamed everything on me alone.

429
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:00,730
I've been holding back for revenge over the past decade.

430
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,280
I don't wanna wait any longer.

431
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:04,660
If you slander my Godfather ever again,

432
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,250
I will kill you

433
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,790
even at the cost of my life!

434
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:08,690
Enough.

435
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,800
You can't kill me.

436
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:14,710
Stop wasting time.

437
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,270
Besides,

438
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,680
you're not the one to fight in the end.

439
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:21,470
I guess you came here

440
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,360
for that thumb ring tonight.

441
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:25,990
Am I right?

442
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:30,940
Exactly.

443
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:34,820
But you will pay with your blood one day.

444
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,470
They're long dead.

445
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,870
Who else knows the truth?

446
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:41,960
Forget about it.

447
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,510
I'll let you go.

448
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:46,550
Send him a message.

449
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:49,870
The secret about this thumb ring.

450
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:52,570
The secret?

451
00:27:53,510 --> 00:27:54,060
What?

452
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:58,270
You've been staying by his side,

453
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,670
while you didn't even know

454
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,820
he had such a big secret hidden in him.

455
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,580
Did you stay up all night?

456
00:29:11,950 --> 00:29:12,930
Where are you going? Wait a second.

457
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:16,910
Give me your hand.

458
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:17,990
For what?

459
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:26,910
Do not lose it again.

460
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:29,880
How did you get it?

461
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,700
Did you go to meet Qi Tianfeng?

462
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,240
What did he tell you?

463
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,730
Shouldn't you have asked me

464
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,140
if he gave me a hard time first?

465
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,140
You shouldn't have acted without my permission.

466
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,190
If you ruined my plan,

467
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,800
we'll lose everything.

468
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,100
How heartless you are.

469
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,440
When you went to Qi Tianfeng's place,

470
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,210
did he give you a hard time?

471
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,390
Qi Tianfeng asked me to tell you something.

472
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,130
He said, so long as you stopped working with the Su family,

473
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,060
he'd tell you the whole story

474
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,240
you wanted to know.

475
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,950
I've told you everything.

476
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,010
No need to say goodbye.

477
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,830
Fortunately, the world is wide.

478
00:31:46,190 --> 00:31:47,230
And we don't need to meet again.

479
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,970
I'm not here to say goodbye to you.

480
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,070
My plans have never failed.

481
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:01,150
Why don't you believe me?

482
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,710
You don't believe in my strategies,

483
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,220
or me.

484
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,100
You

485
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:11,070
are not trustworthy.

486
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,940
But after I heard those stories,

487
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,640
I can understand you now.

488
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:36,010
You survived out of 313 people,

489
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,600
who were brutally murdered.

490
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:41,710
if you're not vigilant or sort of cold-blooded,

491
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:44,710
how can you resist the fear in your heart

492
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,860
and endure the nightmare every night?

493
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,260
Honestly, I'm quite envious

494
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:19,490
of you sometimes.

495
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,580
You and I are both survivors.

496
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,810
But your heart is warm.

497
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:29,700
You still have the guts to love.

498
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:33,420
Love your friends,

499
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:36,770
and those children.

500
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:40,470
You dare to try something impossible.

501
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:43,160
I'm really envious.

502
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,470
Thanks. I'm flattered.

503
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:50,010
No,

504
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,810
I'm the one who should say thank you.

505
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:53,550
Thank you.

506
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,650
Alright...

507
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:00,890
The armed escorts are about to set off.

508
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,620
Come back safely.

509
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:31,050
Look.

510
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,260
This knot is so tough.

511
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,030
It will never get loose again.

512
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,320
[Su]

513
00:36:37,870 --> 00:36:39,270
The Su's trade caravan

514
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:41,570
even outshines the Grand Coordinator's deployment to suppress the bandits.

515
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,590
Su Mingyu really led the team in person.

516
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:46,590
Jin Biao and Shu Yanan are also among them.

517
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:50,910
But the bandits of all the gangs have gathered,

518
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,800
with the help of the martial arts masters from our sect.

519
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,890
Even if these escorts boast their unique skills,

520
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,460
it’s not that easy to transport the raw silk

521
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,590
into the city.

522
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:02,950
Those bandits

523
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,550
are no more than a motley crew.

524
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:08,380
But we must make sure nothing goes wrong.

525
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,390
Then I'll choose 60 more good fighters from our sect.

526
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:13,830
Our men in the sect

527
00:37:13,830 --> 00:37:15,590
all follow us through fire and water.

528
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:19,070
Give them enough rewards before their departure,

529
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,570
and let them settle their families down.

530
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:21,670
Okay.

531
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:27,150
How long has this stone beast been here?

532
00:37:27,730 --> 00:37:28,860
Since our Cao Sect started to thrive

533
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,660
and moved here.

534
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:32,950
It's too old.

535
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:39,270
We should get a new one.

536
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,540
That guy didn't tell me his name, and he refused to leave.

537
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,550
He insists on meeting Mr. Mo.

538
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,350
How are you doing, Mr. Kang?

539
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:03,000
How's your injury?

540
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:05,590
Did we not open the main door today?

541
00:38:06,890 --> 00:38:08,660
I took a different road for something important, of course.

542
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,870
Can a rascal have anything important to talk about?

543
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,400
Mr. Mo said

544
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:15,840
he had nothing to do with you anymore.

545
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:19,480
Why don't you ask him one more time?

546
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,570
I can never talk about the assassination

547
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,420
of Ten Taels of Gold again.

548
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:41,960
But those kids who have been sold

549
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,160
are such poor things.

550
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:46,830
Kang Qiao,

551
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,530
you go arrange this.

552
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,590
Make sure to be considerate and keep the kids safe.

553
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:51,680
OK.

554
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:12,770
Mr. Mo,

555
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:15,600
I’m here to tell you that

556
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:19,580
I can pay back the 30,000 taels of silver I owe you.

557
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:21,210
Pay back?

558
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,780
How?

559
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,920
Did you bring the silver?

560
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,870
15 fast cargo ships,

561
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,100
plus the boatmen.

562
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,580
300 mu of prime paddy fields,

563
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:34,270
and more than 20 high-quality stores.

564
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,820
The properties along the river, and a lobby of the Cao Sect's headquarters.

565
00:39:40,350 --> 00:39:40,910
What do you think?

566
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,950
If the raw silk can’t be sent into the city,

567
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,240
the Su family will fall.

568
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,680
If it's transported into the city,

569
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:50,120
the Cao Sect will lose all their money.

570
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:52,060
Qi Tianfeng's estate

571
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,030
cannot be owned by you no matter what.

572
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:56,320
You're right.

573
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,660
I've spared no effort to set up a series of schemes

574
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,080
just to help you get something, Mr. Mo.

575
00:40:08,090 --> 00:40:08,510
Mr. Mo,

576
00:40:09,070 --> 00:40:10,950
whether the raw silk can be delivered to Nandu

577
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,620
is not up to me,

578
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:14,810
the Su family,

579
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,310
or Qi Tianfeng.

580
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,250
So...

581
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:24,560
It's all up to you, Mr. Mo.

582
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:27,440
Master,

583
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,380
Master Qi is here,

584
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,860
asking to talk to you about a big deal.

585
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:37,400
Master Qi,

586
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:39,950
you’ve borrowed

587
00:40:39,970 --> 00:40:40,920
from almost all the banks in Nandu.

588
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:43,000
Why did you come to our Guanghui Bank so late?

589
00:40:43,470 --> 00:40:44,620
For the last battle,

590
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:46,540
I need to turn to the No.1, of course.

591
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,920
How much do you wanna borrow? And what's the interest?

592
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:52,590
1% interest for all the other banks in Nandu.

593
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,570
But I'll give you 3%.

594
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,380
I can't give you more, or it will break the rule.

595
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:00,190
You've already borrowed money from all the banks in Nandu.

596
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,450
Are you talking about the rule now?

597
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:03,720
I'd like to say something.

598
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:06,410
You've fought against the Su family to this extent

599
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,720
not for profit, right?

600
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,460
What do you think?

601
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:14,490
I thought

602
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,010
this is your sink-or-swim battle.

603
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,210
If you win, you can replace them

604
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,460
and be the head of Nandu Chamber of Commerce,

605
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,340
with great wealth and a prominent reputation.

606
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:30,800
I heard the bandits are rampant on the post roads.

607
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:34,050
I’m afraid the Su family can't get their raw silk into the city.

608
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,680
But the overall situation in the city is still uncertain.

609
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:44,470
The Su family issued the deeds of 80,000 taels of raw silk

610
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:46,620
to lower the price of raw silk,

611
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,560
which was raised by you.

612
00:41:48,350 --> 00:41:50,150
Master Qi, you wanna borrow so much money

613
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:52,030
just to raise the price of the deeds too.

614
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,430
Mr. Qi, am I right?

615
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:59,010
So how much profit do you want, Mr. Mo?

616
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:00,980
I don't want any of it.

617
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:05,620
I only want 10% of the Cao Sect's monthly income.

618
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:10,100
10% of the income...

619
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:19,830
Everyone says that you are a ruthless profiteer.

620
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,720
Today, I saw you

621
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,590
even going further.

622
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,990
What's wrong with a merchant seeking profit?

623
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:31,540
I promise you

624
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:34,640
10% of the income.

625
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,240
Great!

626
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,110
You can borrow as much money as you like.

627
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,120
I can give you the key to the vault.

628
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,210
But Master Qi,

629
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,970
what will you give me as collateral?

630
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:48,930
Just tell me what else you want, Mr. Mo.

631
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:51,550
Master Qi,

632
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:53,810
I've given you everything I have.

633
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:56,770
Of course, you should mortgage something valuable with me.

634
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:58,750
I think,

635
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,360
the estate of your Cao Sect is quite suitable.

636
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:04,180
[Guanghui Bank]

637
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:10,910
Mr. Qi,

638
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:13,430
as the old saying goes,

639
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:16,520
do not forget me when you succeed.

640
00:43:19,250 --> 00:43:20,270
Mr. Mo, let's say goodbye here.

641
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:20,950
OK.

642
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:24,970
Master,

643
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:26,270
how much did you borrow?

644
00:43:26,930 --> 00:43:27,770
Let's talk about it when we're back.
