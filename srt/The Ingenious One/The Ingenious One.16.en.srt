Thank you.

I understand. The tribute cloth thing is more important.

to have you here.

40
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,190
Are you satisfied with

41
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:20,970
the musicians

42
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:21,970
you hired from me?

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,680
Of course.

44
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,940
The musicians at Zhaixing House are all top-notch.

45
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,190
But there was a misunderstanding.

46
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:30,100
I hope you don't mind.

47
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,490
Misunderstanding? What is it?

Please come in.

00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,790
Mr. Kang of Guanghui Bank did come to me

50
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:06,500
for the girl you mentioned just now.

51
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,450
I bought this girl

52
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,510
from the black market.

53
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,580
She's talented.

54
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,340
So, when Mr. Kang

55
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,670
asked to redeem her,

56
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,480
I didn't agree.

57
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:19,980
But this girl is the daughter of a good friend of mine

58
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,410
who died some time ago.

59
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,250
She got lost.

60
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,840
That's why she was sold into the black market.

61
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,380
I didn't expect her to end up in Zhaixing House.

62
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,500
A few days ago, another friend of mine went to look for her rashly.

63
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,120
I was afraid that he had disturbed you.

64
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,440
She's fine at Zhaixing House.

65
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,409
No one came to look for her.

66
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,890
My brother is a swordsman.

67
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:50,690
He went to see you with my jade pendant.

68
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,100
You didn't meet him?

69
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,050
No.

00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:04,150

attend to them.

00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,700
Keep things in order.

76
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,330

We're so busy today. You should go in and help.

79

Why are you sitting here and slacking off?

80
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:00,640
Miss,

81
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,250
I'm just taking a break.

82
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,590
I'll go now.

83
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:14,520
Mr. Tang.

84
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,370
Let me show you how it's done.

85
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,100
Mr. Tang.

86
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,260
I'll make this place bankrupt

87
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,830
within one day.

88
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:27,150
Just wait and see. Today is the day.

89
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,750
The present from Mr. Tang of the Tangs' Gambling House is a sword.

90
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:34,880
Wait.

00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,720
Yun Xiang.

92
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,300
What?

93
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,330
You aren't letting people in?

94
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,460
Why do you have Jin Biao's sword?

95
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,980
I don't want to talk to you.

96
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,610
Get me Yun Xiang.

97
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:56,590
Well,

98
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,780
it was I who condoned

99
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,360
Wen Cong opening a gambling house

100
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,000
in Nandu.

101
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:06,040
But after you came here,

102
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,230
you bought Liansheng House and refreshed it.

103
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,340
Now this place is even better

104
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,390
than Tang's House.

105
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:15,510
Impressive.

106
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,730
Mr. Tang, I know you are joking.

107
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,850
It's all for the prosperity of Nandu.

108
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:21,630
We're just doing business.

109
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,330
As an old saying goes,

110
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,920
"There is only one sun in the sky and one king in a country."

111
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:30,660
By the same logic, we can't have two leaders

112
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:33,360
in the same industry and in the same region.

113
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:35,250
Am I right?

114
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,310
Judging from what you said,

115
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,010
you want to battle it out with me?

116
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,130
Let's play.

117
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,000
What's the stake then?

118
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:48,820
You.

119
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,200
I'm the stake?

120
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,540
If you lose,

121
00:07:53,790 --> 00:07:55,760
write a contract to say

122
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,140
that you volunteer

123
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,409
to become my servant.

124
00:07:59,030 --> 00:07:59,510
Is that okay?

125
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,470
What if I win?

126
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:01,380
You can't win.

127
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:08,150
In my opinion,

128
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,330
you are actually a cruel person.

129
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,590
You knew I caught Jin Biao.

130
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,700
You've been chatting for so long.

131
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:17,980
But you didn't mention anything about him.

132
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:21,480
You're just like Wen Cong.

133
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:22,340
Exactly.

134
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:24,820
Poor Jin Biao.

135
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,630
Before we fight it out,

136
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,600
do you dare to hurt him?

137
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,250
Well, well.

138
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,350
You agreed to gamble with me, right?

139
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:36,700
I can't wait.

140
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,270
Let me tell you the truth.

141
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,070
The place where my family's servants live

142
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:45,500
is much more luxurious than the houses of common people.

143
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:47,250
There are plenty of girls like her.

144
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,030
Do you remember Qi Tianfeng?

145
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,980
What does he have in the end?

146
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,290
Don't compare him to me.

147
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,960
I want it to be big and exciting.

148
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:00,220
Just decide when and where.

149
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,980
I'm looking forward to it.

150
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:03,800
You seem to be anxious to gamble with me.

151
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:04,860
How about this?

152
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,990
Let's do it today.

153
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,060
Now and here.

154
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,260
That's what I think as well.

155
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,430
I'll wait for you downstairs.

156
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,580
Get ready and come down soon.

157
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:50,020
Tang Xiao only brought Meizhu this time.

158
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,350
That means Zhong should be guarding Jin.

159
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:08,210
You must keep in mind

160
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,470
you are going to find out whether Jin is safe.

161
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,890
Don't put yourself in danger.

162
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,590
Have you foreseen

163
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,690
the capture of Ten Taels of Gold?

164
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,460
I'm sorry.

165
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,520
I didn't mean it.

166
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,620
It's okay.

167
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:30,890
Don't worry. I know what to do.

168
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,480
Remember, don't try to

169
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:38,050
save Jin recklessly.

170
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,080
Protect yourself.

171
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,150
I already have a perfect plan.

172
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,050
You didn't nag when I went out in the past.

173
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,590
In the past? I was single back then.

174
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,090
All right. I can take care of it.

175
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,280
Tang Xiao must be

176
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,060
well prepared.

177
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,540
Don't lose.

178
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,590
If we want it in the bag,

179
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:08,000
we need the support of something.

180
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,510
What?

181
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:31,450
Don't move.

182
00:12:06,550 --> 00:12:07,680
You have so many sides.

183
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,730
Defeat Tang Xiao first.

184
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,560
Excuse me.

185
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,860
I heard a big joke just now.

186
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,420
I can't wait to share it with you.

187
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,440
Just now,

188
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,550
someone

189
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,070
wanted to compete with me

190
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,870
on gambling.

191
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,370
Who is this?

192
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Who else can it be?

193
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,180
It's the new owner of Liansheng House,

194
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,270
the arrogant Young Master Xiang.

195
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:08,060
He's seeking his own destruction.

196
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,880
Destruction?

197
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,220
How come you always

198
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,140
walk without any sound?

199
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,220
Tang Xiao is good at cheating.

200
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,140
By "he",

201
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:24,770
are you referring to Mr. Yun?

202
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:26,020
Of course not.

203
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:29,080
Tang Xiao has been pretentious for so many years.

204
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,870
It's time that someone taught him a lesson.

205
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:35,270
Since Mr. Yun is your friend,

206
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,210
then he is also a friend of the Su family.

207
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,930
I heard someone else say that before.

208

209
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:46,840
You've been with Ms. Su for so many years.

210
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,810
Why haven't you learned from her

211
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,840
to be elegant and magnanimous?

212
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,050

He used himself as the stake.

231
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:17,820
How long has it been

232
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,450
since we saw such a big gamble last time?

233
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,110
It's really exciting, isn't it?

234
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,370
Yes, it's going to be interesting this time.

235
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:36,580
Tang Xiao,

236
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,240
what if you lose?

237
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,040
I've never lost in my whole life.

I bet half of my fortune and you bet your freedom.

00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,480
Is that fair?

244
00:15:55,110 --> 00:15:57,310
I'm afraid you'll lose more than that.

245
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,900

-Young Master, please spare my life.
-Tang Xiao is too unruly.

00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,570
Just make a guess.

Please spare my life.

If we guess she can live past 18,

317
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,250
are you really going to kill her on the spot?

318
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,870
You already have Menglan,

320
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,260
Don't covet my girl.

It's none of your business.

322
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,830
What can I do?

323
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,240
What can I do to her?

324
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,530
For a flower-like girl like her,

325
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:54,360
a disease or an accident

326
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:55,950
can destroy her easily.

327
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,200
What do you think?

328
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:03,220
Mr. Tang is indeed bold.

329
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:07,780
I throw in the towel in this round.

330
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,150
No.

331
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,120
That's too hasty.

00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:19,530
You...

333
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:21,960
You're just trying to be the bigger man.

334
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:25,070
Even if you admitted defeat, you need to play by the rules.

335
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,400
Yun Xiang,

336
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,490
I'll ask you again.

337
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,700
And you need to answer me again.

338
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,780
Can she live to age 18?

339
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:48,200
I think she's haunted by evil energy.

340
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:50,530
She's been suffering.

341
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,440
I don't think she'll survive to 18.

342
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:01,900
Nonsense!

343
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:04,510
She works for the Tang family.

344
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,170
I'll treat her well.

345
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:08,860
18?

346
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,330
If I want her to live past 80,

347
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:12,290
she wouldn't dare to die at 70.

348
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,080
Look at you. I was just kidding.

349
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,450
Stand up.

350
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,330
How rude.

351
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:20,560
Here.

352
00:23:21,130 --> 00:23:24,280
Thank Mr. Yun for saving my life.

353
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,500
Thank you, Mr. Yun.

354
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,240
Move aside!

355
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:31,700
Yun Xiang.

356
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,910
Three rounds in total.

357
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:35,840
I've won the first round.

358
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,240
Winning you in this way

359
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,080
is fair, isn't it?

360
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,500
It's all about flexible strategies and tactics.

361
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:49,890
Mr. Tang, you really excel at this.

362
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:53,520
I'm impressed.

363
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:55,940
Mr. Tang, you are on our turf now.

364
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,360
You must be worried about using our stuff.

365
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:05,960
It doesn't matter.

366
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,070
If you want to cheat, make sure I can't tell.

367
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,700
As long as you can do that, you win.

368
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,280
Fine.

369
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:14,320
You seem very confident.

370
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,140
I don't want to make things too complicated.

371
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,240
Let's play something easy.

372
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:20,740
Let's have a game of luck.

373
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,540
How about word guessing?

374
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,650
Word guessing?

375
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,830
The easier kind or the more difficult one?

376
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:28,550
Let's take the easier form.

377
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,320
It's the simplest

378
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,770
but the most interesting.

379
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,920
The easy-level word guessing?

380
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:34,760
What is it?

381
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,740
You don't know?

382
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:39,760
Even a kid can play that.

383
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:40,490
Really?

384
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,180
You play instead of me then.

385
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:46,010
No, no, no. Mr. Tang, it should be you.

386
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:48,920
Word guessing it is.

387
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,110
I think you believe no one

388
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,770
here in Liansheng House.

389
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,610
How about this?

390
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:56,640
You can write the word yourself.

391
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,910
Choose one from spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

392
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,960
If I guess right, I win.

393
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,760
One word out of four.

394
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,210
Then before this game starts,

395
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,880
I already have a 75% chance of winning.

396
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,020
Before we know the outcome,

397
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,270
it doesn't matter even if you have a 90% chance.

398
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,310
How confident you are.

399
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:38,180
Tang Xiao,

400
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:39,380
don't go too far.

401
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:40,910
Have I gone too far?

402
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,800
It doesn't matter, Mr. Su.

403
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:51,820
He's worried that

404
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,730
we would tamper with the paper and ink.

405
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,330
It's reasonable.

406
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,420
Learn from him.

407
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:02,090
I want to use the paper and ink from your accounting office.

408
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:03,390
Pretty,

409
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:04,500
please get those for me.

410
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,120
Tianhu.

411
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,180
Mr. Yun hasn't agreed.

412
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:15,720
Go ahead.

413
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:20,360
Meizhu.

414
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,870
Go with her.

415
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:23,550
She looks dull,

416
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,030
but she's very cunning.

417
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:56,930
Jin.

418
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:20,620
Drunken Dragon!

419
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:53,620
Run!

420
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:56,160
Yanan, run!

421
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:21,490
She's not poisoned?

422
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:57,720
Master wants paper.

423
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:06,210
Are these clean?

424
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,240
Mr. Yun doesn't want that innocent maid

425
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,490
to die on the spot.

426
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,140
So, he lost the first round.

427
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,770
The second round is crucial.

428
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,130
Why is he still so careless?

429
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,820
It's very likely that he'll cheat.

430
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,950
How can he cheat at word guessing?

431
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:32,780
He...

432
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,830
You don't know him well.

433
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,670
He looks calm,

434
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,990
making you anxious.

435
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,770
In fact, he has been fully prepared.

436
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:53,180
This scene

437
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:57,360
reminds me of the poet, Li Bai.

438
00:29:58,370 --> 00:30:01,040
He once ordered senior officials

439
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,480
to remove his boots and prepare ink for him.

440
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,580
I also want to have a try.

441
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:07,710
If I take off the boots, it will be smelly.

442
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:08,350
Right?

443
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:09,960
Then just grind the inkstick for me.

444
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,210
What do you think, Mr. Su?

445
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,040
Will you

446
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:15,060
do that?

447
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,300
How dare you compare yourself to Li Bai?

448
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,940
If you don't want to,

449
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,570
then let the beauty do it.

450
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:25,340
I'll do it.

451
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,950
I must find a chance

452
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,140
to teach Tang Xiao a lesson.

453
00:31:01,510 --> 00:31:02,000
Qian,

454
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,920
you've been through all kinds of hardships.

455
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,040
Why can't you keep calm when things involve the Su family?

456
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,750
Don't worry. The evil will be punished.

457
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:11,280
He'll kick Tang Xiao's ass for you.

458
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,850
Mr. Mo. Mr. Qian.

459
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:17,700
Which round is it?

460
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,460
Round two.

461
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,430
Yun Xiang lost the first round.

462
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,020
We'll see the outcome of this round soon.

463
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,980
Why is Mr. Su serving Tang Xiao?

464
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,710
Tang Xiao has always been disorderly.

465
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,810
He's just trying to humiliate Mr. Su.

466
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:43,230
Then,

467
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,350
Mr. Su is better than Tang Xiao.

468
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,490
What do you mean, Miss Shu?

469
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,560
Mr. Su has been living a luxurious life.

470
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:53,540
He doesn't know how difficult normal people's life is.

471
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:55,920
After experiencing this,

472
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,560
he'll know compromise and endurance are fine.

473
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,500
He'll be more broad-minded.

474
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:09,750
Please.

475
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,160
Am I that pretty?

476
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,780
Don't you know you should recuse?

477
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,420
You can't just say my word out loud

478
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,130
after I finish writing, can you?

479
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:43,860
You. Come here.

480
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:46,770
You're kind of chubby.

481
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:48,780
Go up and block their view.

482
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,460
Be quiet.

483
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,280
Okay.

484
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,310
Go away.

485
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:20,850
You can guess now.

486
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:28,150
Guess.

487
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,020
Mr. Tang, calm down.

488
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:32,190
Let me think about it.

489
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,500
You made the rule yourself.

490
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:40,780
Take your time.

491
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,670
Beauty, come on.

492
00:33:46,390 --> 00:33:48,700
Wait there to open the box anytime.

493
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,830
This round is crucial.

494
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,040
If Young Master Xiang loses again,

495
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,670
he'll become a servant in the Tang family.

496
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:27,860
That's not right.

497
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,090
He has always been decisive.

498
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:31,790
Why is he hesitant suddenly?

499
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,580
He chose to play word guessing himself.

500
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,600
I'm worried that he would fail

501
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,710
if he planned poorly.

502
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:40,690
Girl.

503
00:34:41,350 --> 00:34:42,480
This is the second round.

504
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:43,699
He lost the first round.

505
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,460
If he loses again,

506
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:45,550
he will be Tang Xiao's servant.

507
00:34:47,139 --> 00:34:47,610
Don't worry.

508
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:49,929
He will surely win.

509
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:53,969
Mr. Mo,

510
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:55,500
I have a private request.

511
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,240
May I have a word with you?

512
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,570
I was just thinking about this.

513
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:09,820
Yun Xiang is betting his freedom on this

514
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,690
but you and Jin Biao were not here.

515
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,610
Jin Biao was captured. That's why.

516
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:15,300
But I was careless.

517
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,880
I failed to save him.

518
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:18,670
It's not your fault.

519
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,040
It's right to escape first in that situation.

520
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,010
Drunken Dragon?

521
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:33,300
You were poisoned by Drunken Dragon.

522
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,360
How did you manage to escape?

523
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,880
Why are you like Yun Xiang?

524
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,620
You both suspect your own people first.

525
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,180
Why are you like Yun Xiang?

526
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,450
You both borrow shadowmen from me when you need help.

527
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,740
Tang Xiao once brought people to Liansheng House to cause trouble.

528
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,530
I was almost injured by poisonous needles.

529
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,660
That's how I know he's a master of poison.

530
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,520
Therefore, I was fully prepared when I went to rescue Jin.

531
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,330
The medicine I brought couldn't detoxify the poison immediately,

532
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,170
but it could delay the effect of the poison

533
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:07,570
so that I could have enough energy to escape from Tang's Residence.

534
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,820
I'm just curious.

535
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,040
I didn't suspect you.

536
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:18,610
How about this?

537
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:20,950
I'll ask shadowmen to keep an eye on Tang's Residence.

538
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:22,380
If Jin Biao is transferred,

539
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,090
we'll know.

540
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,240
That's enough. Thank you, Mr. Mo.

541
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,440
Yun Xiang.

542
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:45,190
It's about sunset. Give your answer quickly.

543
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:47,770
Why don't you just go back to Tang's Residence with me?

544
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,630
I will definitely go to Tang's Residence.

545
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,640
But not now.

546
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:55,840
You are dragging your feet.

547
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,250
Yun.

548
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:01,640
I'm back. Are you more eased?

549
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,020
I feel more than that.

550
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,050
Upon your return,

551
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:10,040
I suddenly had an idea.

552
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,910
I've made up my mind.

553
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:22,570
Have you?

554
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,360
Think it through.

555
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,650
You only have one chance.

556
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,810
"Snowflakes are just like petals of pear flowers."

557
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:47,010
"In the heavy snow, I can barely see the village."

558
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:52,590
The world turns quiet when heavy snow falls.

559
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:55,160
I choose winter.

560
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,680
Manager Ke, please reveal the answer.

561
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:29,650
[Winter]

562
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:29,870
It's really winter.

563
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,240
He guessed right.

564
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,260
That's unexpected.

565
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,680
Tang Xiao was defeated.

566
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:48,450
You cheated.

567
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,300
Tang Xiao.

568
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,360
If you can tell me,

569
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,850
how I won,

570
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:54,840
I can make you the winner of this round.

571
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,670
I've seen so many eyes.

572
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,630
Yours are the most beautiful.

573
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,120
If you keep staring at me with them,

574
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,840
I'll take them home without you.

575
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:31,730
Did you cheat?

576
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,030
Maybe.

577
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:36,510
Maybe not.

578
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,270
Round three.

579
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:42,170
I can decide how to play this round, right?

580
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,120
We've finished two rounds

581
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,830
so quickly.

582
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,380
Mr. Tang, you think it's not fun enough, don't you?

583
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,780
What do you mean?

584
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,030
I'm thinking

585
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:01,410
how about making this bigger?

586
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,940
I'm listening. I'm afraid you can't make it big enough.

587
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:07,450
Let's see

588
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:08,680
if Liansheng House can make more revenues

589
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:11,570
than Tang's House

590
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,910
in the next three days.

591
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:23,350
Okay.
