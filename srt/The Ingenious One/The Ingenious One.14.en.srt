4
00:01:51,729 --> 00:01:52,229
Master!

5
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:56,640
Master! Master!

6
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,039
Master!

7
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,010
Did you kill him?

8
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,240
You couldn't do it?

9
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,170
I'll do it for ten taels of gold.

10
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,700
No one is allowed to touch him.

11
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,100
I'll make him suffer a fate worse than death.

12
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,970
He'll be like a stray dog for the rest of his life.

13
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,470
Yun Xiang.

14
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:13,910
Mr. Mo.

15
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,630
Thank you for your help.

16
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,540
Let's not talk about that.

17
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,540
Come with me to see Master.

18
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,540
It'll be hard to explain ourselves if we wait too long.

19
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,120
Let's go.

20
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,579
We're at the mountain gate.

21
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,820
You should stop here.

22
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,250
Master Wen,

23
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,420
I’ve been cultivating in the mountain for ten years.

24
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,080
I can't wait anymore.

25
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,400
I'm willing to give up on being Master's personal disciple

26
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,060
to go down the mountain with you.

27
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,720
You've been cultivating for ten years.

28
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,150
Why are you still so reckless?

29
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,700
Even if I tell you,

30
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,900
what could you do?

31
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,480
I'm not bragging,

32
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,760
but you may not be my match now.

33
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,550
Yes.

34
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,190
But in terms of wisdom,

35
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,310
you're right.

36
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,860
Those who are exceptionally gifted are allowed to stay in the Sect.

37
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,230
I was chased away

38
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,530
after less than seven years.

39
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,260
But let me ask you,

40
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,410
what do the members of the Yuntai Sect pride ourselves on?

41
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:43,820
We build our foundations on, and make something of ourselves through wisdom.

42
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,660
"Wisdom" can accommodate everything in the world.

43
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,160
Of course.

44
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:48,880
Okay.

45
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,030
You have cultivated your wisdom for ten years.

46
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:54,360
Why can't it accommodate the hatred in your heart?

47
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,380
The Yuntai Sect only teaches you your craft,

48
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,740
but how you act depends on your heart.

49
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,820
As the saying goes,

50
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,760
your heart should be placed before your craft.

51
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,300
To do the opposite would be to become a heretic.

52
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:10,570
Kid,

53
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,020
let bygones be bygones.

54
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,990
I hope you can remember this.

55
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,540
You haven't left the mountain yet,

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,490
and everything you're saying is already against the Sect's rules.

57
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,530
What? Are you going to report me?

58
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,340
No.

59
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,860
Look at me. I can neither let go of my sentimentality

60
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,220
nor my hatred.

61
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,690
Have these ten years of cultivation

62
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,200
been all for nothing?

63
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,659
One day, when you begin your quest for revenge,

64
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,480
don't forget to ask yourself

65
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,340
whether you are sacrificing what's important for petty gain.

66
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,710
We wouldn't have known this if we hadn't defeated the Cao Sect.

67
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,980
Qi Tianfeng is really capable.

68
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:01,440
The connections behind the Cao Sect are convoluted,

69
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,870
but he's managed to sort them all out.

70
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:05,050
If he didn't have a big appetite,

71
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,520
the Cao Sect would still be going strong.

72
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,720
You can't ask for more than your lot in life.

73
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,370
He didn't know that desires beget misery,

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,040
and having no wants brings strength.

75
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:15,740
By the way,

76
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,390
Qi Tianfeng said that the Lingyuan Sect is behind Tang Xiao.

77
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:19,790
What do you think?

78
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,130
Qi Tianfeng is vicious,

79
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,810
but he's a straightforward person.

80
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,060
If he said that,

81
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,540
it's probably true.

82
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,270
When did you hear that

83
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,040
the Lingyuan Sect has also started to get involved in trade?

84
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,110
Their foundation has always been in the martial arts.

85
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:35,580
And they hate

86
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,370
the Yuntai Sect's tactics.

87
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,450
But if Tang Xiao has no backer,

88
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,690
how does he dare to instigate Qi Tianfeng to provoke the Yuntai Sect?

89
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,110
Forget it.

90
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,400
I'll judge

91
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,480
after I take down Tang Xiao.

92
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,320
In other words,

93
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,560
there's no need to report to Master for the time being.

94
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,540
You must be afraid that if things get out of hand,

95
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,980
Master will make other arrangements

96
00:06:03,010 --> 00:06:04,250
and hinder your private investigation.

97
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,300
I'll have to trouble you, Mr. Mo.

98
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:06,900
Fine.

99
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:08,320
Thank you.

100
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:15,850
I promised you.

101
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,540
Why are you still pulling a long face?

102
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:23,100
I have been planning my every move through my skill of induction.

103
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,140
The moment Qi Tianfeng fell into my trap,

104
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:27,810
he was destined to fail.

105
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:30,520
Now that everything is settled,

106
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,120
it seems

107
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,190
I'm not feeling how I'd thought I would.

108
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,420
Seeing the people around you

109
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,760
go through all this for you

110
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,310
has made you soft-hearted?

111
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,970
At the end of the day, Yuntai's craft is to make use of everything.

112
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,040
As long as the ending is good,

113
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:54,190
the process is secondary.

114
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,470
You've been cultivating the longest, so you're the most deeply entangled.

115
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:57,130
It's not your fault.

116
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,540
Don't blame yourself.

117
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,080
Do you think I will lose everyone around me

118
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:03,710
if I go on like this?

119
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,000
You used me a lot.

120
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:08,910
Why don't you

121
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,370
feel any guilt towards me?

122
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,000
Yun Xiang.

123
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,010
Do you admit to your crime?

124
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,460
I did this

125
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,150
to follow your instructions.

126
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:27,050
You're talking nonsense again.

127
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:27,880
Tell me.

128
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,190
Let’s see how you’ll explain this time.

129
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,860
It’s easy

130
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,730
to defeat the Su family.

131
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,360
But it can only bring minor benefits to the Sect.

132
00:07:38,350 --> 00:07:39,770
What is most valuable about the Su family?

133
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:41,940
It’s neither their property,

134
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,680
nor their status as a royal silk supplier,

135
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,980
but the good name they have earned over the past 100 years.

136
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,890
Once their reputation is destroyed,

137
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:52,060
it won't be easy to rebuild.

138
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:53,920
Instead,

139
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,900
why don't we make the Su family work for us?

140
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,710
You think because you helped the Su family once,

141
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,050
they will submit to you?

142
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:02,980
How childish are you?

143
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,770
If the Su family reorganizes the business world in Nandu

144
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,660
and return peace and prosperity to this land,

145
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,970
does the Yuntai Sect

146
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,970
have to fixate on controlling the business world?

147
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:15,220
Why don’t we cooperate with the Su family?

148
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,710
Our interests will be secured,

149
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:21,050
and we will be saved of a lot of trouble.

150
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,780
So I thought it over,

151
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,660
and I think right now, protecting the Su family

152
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,180
is to protect the people of Nandu

153
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,039
and the proper way of the Yuntai Sect.

154
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,460
Mo Bufan.

155
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:36,000
Do you agree with what Yun Xiang said?

156
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,169
Yes.

157
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:43,820
Master.

158
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,740
Master,

159
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,340
please don't get angry because of this.

160
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,500
I think it's of no harm

161
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:53,370
to try it his way.

162
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,580
Mo Bufan.

163
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,390
You've worked with Wen Cong for 20 years,

164
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,630
but you never spoke up for him.

165
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,750
Yun Xiang is new here,

166
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,360
but he has already gotten your approval.

167
00:09:08,310 --> 00:09:08,890
Forget it.

168
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,790
You can give it a try.

169
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,660
Yun Xiang, watch yourself.

170
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,810
Yes, Master.

171
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,340
From today onwards,

172
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,650
Yun Xiang will take over Wen Cong's charge of Nandu.

173
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,900
Mo Bufan, you've been out in the world for many years.

174
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,980
You're shrewd and a smooth-talker.

175
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,790
Don't pass your bad habits on to Yun Xiang.

176
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,370
Understood.

177
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,480
You're the one who argued with Master,

178
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,940
but I'm the one who got scolded.

179
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,860
You don't understand Master's temper.

180
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,450
He didn't scold me because he's really angry.

181
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,910
Then you should have restrained yourself.

182
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,600
It would have been fine if only you two were here.

183
00:09:58,630 --> 00:09:59,530
I was there too.

184
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,100
You should have shown him some respect.

185
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,060
You being there

186
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,150
was exactly what I wanted.

187
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,740
So you were trying to provoke Master on purpose

188
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
to affect his judgment

189
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,580
so that he wouldn't notice

190
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,060
you had been avenging your personal grudge, right?

191
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,040
You have a clear mind.

192
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,620
Did you have to say it out loud?

193
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,820
Master was right.

194
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:24,870
Don't get yourself hurt.

195
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,130
Master scolded me for no reason.

196
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,050
I'm going to infect you

197
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:34,660
with all the bad habits I have.

198
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:37,360
What do you mean?

199
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,420
Let me ask you.

200
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:42,260
If you obeyed the Sect's rules in all your actions,

201
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,620
everything you do would be flawless

202
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,320
and everyone around you would respect and fear you.

203
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,080
Is that what you want?

204
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,180
to be left behind and isolated from the world.

205
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,820
Isn't that the highest level of attainment

206
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,340
us people of the Yuntai Sect pursue?

207
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:55,190
Bah!

208
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,180
You really want to become an immortal?

209
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,700
Then you shouldn't have any emotions.

210
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,530
Do I have any?

211
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,580
If your heart were really as calm as water,

212
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,610
I wouldn't have told you

213
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,220
anything I just did.

214
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,380
Alright.

215
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,670
Lower your defenses.

216
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,030
Aren't you tired having them up all the time?

217
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,940
When you feel relaxed,

218
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,280
you will find

219
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:19,580
the world is not as good as you think,

220
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,740
but it's also not as bad as you think it is.

221
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,950
[Liansheng House]

222
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,020
But to be honest,

223
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,480
I was really scared.

224
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:38,420
But I thought, "I cannot chicken out."

225
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,580
I don't care about other people,

226
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,160
but I have to take care of Shu.

227
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,140
Here.

228
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:48,860
Jin has always been loyal.

229
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,630
What happened next?

230
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,640
It got more interesting.

231
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,800
Before I rushed up with a knife,

232
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,660
Shu took two steps forward

233
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,060
and began talking to the pirate.

234
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:58,960
By the way,

235
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,620
what does “blood debt" mean?

236
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:03,770
And when did you save

237
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:04,950
the Master?

238
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,640
Blood debt is a custom of the pirates.

239
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,840
As long as a ship encounters a disaster at sea

240
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,800
and is rescued,

241
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:14,490
the Master will owe a blood debt.

242
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,550
No matter

243
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:18,450
which ship the benefactor runs into in the future

244
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,180
and no matter whether they are enemies or friends,

245
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:21,420
they can ask for compensation.

246
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:22,730
If they are refused,

247
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,700
the Master

248
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,110
will become the public enemy of all the pirates.

249
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,190
You are friends with pirates?

250
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,780
I just heard some rumors

251
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:34,850
and know some names.

252
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,660
We were desperate, so I wanted to trick Master Guan.

253
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,340
Cheers.

254
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,250
Here, fill me up.

255
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,220
You...

256
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,640
Yun Xiang led you astray.

257
00:12:58,940 --> 00:12:59,980
But you didn't learn the crux.

258
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,400
Jin.

259
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,530
What do you mean?

260
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,580
When it comes to lying,

261
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:05,980
when has Yun Xiang ever failed?

262
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:09,530
Shu is different.

263
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,100
What she said...

264
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,340
That pirate chief

265
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,620
didn't pay attention to her at all.

266
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:53,900
Sure enough,

267
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,780
children see everything.

268
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,360
They can tell who is kind and who isn't

269
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:00,220
from a glance.

270
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,300
She's right.

271
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:03,400
In your eyes,

272
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,600
everyone is a pawn.

273
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,220
You tried so hard to save Godfather,

274
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,560
but you didn't look sad at all that he's dead.

275
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,720
Death is final. Why beat ourselves up over it?

276
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,580
If you obeyed the Sect's rules

277
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,340
in all your actions,

278
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,580
everything you do would be flawless

279
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,430
and everyone around you would respect and fear you.

280
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,030
Is that what you want?

281
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,620
You are not worth

282
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:27,740
my loyalty.

283
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,260
Did I win

284
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:33,970
or lose?

285
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:37,860
Yes.

286
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,710
or not.

287
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:50,930
Is this

288
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:53,180
farewell wine?

289
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,500
What do you think?

290
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,100
There are so many interesting places.

291
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:10,460
Why do you have to sit here?

292
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,280
Let's go.

293
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,960
Rather than watching others from afar,

294
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,470
it's better to join them.

295
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,220
Do you get drunk easily?

296
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,859
What do you mean?

297
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,060
I envy those who get drunk easily.

298
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,500
Everyone is drunk, but you alone are sober.

299
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:13,500
Isn't it tiring?

300
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,260
Why didn't you go in when you saw us?

301
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,890
I didn't want to disturb you.

302
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:23,950
What happened today?

303
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,380
I know you've gotten your revenge.

304
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,070
Tell me when you're leaving.

305
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,470
Don't stay silent.

306
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:37,850
What?

307
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,020
Do I have to create an uproar

308
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:40,980
to celebrate?

309
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,140
Celebrate what?

310
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,220
To celebrate leaving those disputes

311
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,300
or to celebrate leaving me?

312
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,220
Sounds good.

313
00:17:53,010 --> 00:17:53,840
Let me think about it.

314
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:54,840
Okay.

315
00:18:13,330 --> 00:18:14,570
You really want me to leave?

316
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:31,660
If I say I will change,

317
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,460
will you believe me?

318
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,580
Change what? How?

319
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,690
Mr. Wen told me

320
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,960
that if I begin my quest for revenge one day,

321
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:47,500
to not mistake what's important for what's trivial.

322
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:50,180
I was fixated on revenge

323
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,140
and I never cared about the people around me.

324
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,340
I thought bringing Qi Tianfeng to justice

325
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,900
would make me happy.

326
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,000
But it turns out

327
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,900
I feel empty inside.

328
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,410
I'm afraid if this goes on,

329
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,580
I will lose everyone around me.

330
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,280
How can you see the people around you?

331
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:17,270
They are all pawns.

332
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,970
Have you ever seen a chess player's heart hurt

333
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,480
when he's about to sacrifice a pawn?

334
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,180
I want to live in another way.

335
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,440
Waiter.

336
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,280
Another jar of apricot blossom wine.

337
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,530
I can drink two more jars.

338
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,860
Why are we going back?

339
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:02,240
When I'm not around,

340
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,720
don't drink alone.

341
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,720
I thought you were a good drinker.

342
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:06,720
I feel great.

343
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,140
Let me ask you.

344
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,500
The next step is to deal with Tang Xiao.

345
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,740
Yes.

346
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,400
Do you have an idea?

347
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:19,500
Yes.

348
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,390
So fast?

349
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,940
As expected of my Young Master Xiang,

350
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:30,930
how brilliant.

351
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:33,920
You must really be drunk.

352
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,340
No, I'm not leaving.

353
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,780
I'll stay and help you.

354
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:43,800
I'll stay forever.

355
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,720
Stop talking nonsense.

356
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,160
Say it again tomorrow after you've thought it through.

357
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:51,750
It'll be the same thing tomorrow.

358
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,560
We agreed to take revenge together.

359
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,180
I got my revenge.

360
00:21:58,830 --> 00:21:59,970
But you haven't.

361
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,990
This time, I'll stay and keep an eye on you.

362
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:09,970
Keep an eye on me?

363
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,760
To see if you have changed,

364
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,760
if you've learned how to treat others.

365
00:22:21,290 --> 00:22:22,410
Thank you for not abandoning me.

366
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,950
Did you really lie to Master Guan?

367
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,190
I learned it from you.

368
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,950
Weren't you afraid the Heavens would punish you

369
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,140
for lying about a blood debt?

370
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,290
♫Yumen mountains stack together♫

371
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,310
I'm not a good person.

372
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,580
♫Beacon towers spread all over the mountains♫

373
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:44,500
It would have punished me long ago if it wanted to.

374
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,090
♫People depended on beacon fires on the frontier♫

375
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,290
♫Horses disappeared into the mountains♫

376
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:58,190
♫Spring and rain are in our hearts♫

377
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:04,280
♫Locking two doors to our hearts♫

378
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:07,560
♫More wrinkles appear on my forehead♫

379
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:10,850
♫I was so anxious♫

380
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:14,100
♫I feared the wind would blow away my fate♫

381
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:17,470
♫People come and go♫

382
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:20,830
♫Turning around once in a lifetime♫

383
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:23,870
♫From now on, the door to my heart♫

384
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,070
♫Will not entertain anyone else♫

385
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,610
[Liansheng House]

386
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:04,920
Are you awake?

387
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,780
My head hurts.

388
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:10,920
How did we come back?

389
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:12,670
You don't remember?

390
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:32,730
I only remember some things.

391
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:37,820
Which?

392
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,380
You said you wanted to turn over a new leaf

393
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,140
and be sincere to the people around you.

394
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,250
What else?

395
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,300
You...

396
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,170
want me to supervise you to keep your promise.

397
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,720
What? Did I say something else?

398
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,720
No, that's all.

399
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:22,940
Let's get down to business.

400
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,860
I've figured out a way

401
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,980
to deal with Tang Xiao.

402
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,260
But this time,

403
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,880
I'll need everyone's cooperation.

404
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:30,680
Also,

405
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,150
in the future,

406
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,530
if I do something

407
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,130
to hurts others' feelings,

408
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:36,780
just point it out.

409
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:37,910
I'll listen to you.

410
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:42,850
Let’s go.

411
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,700
Are you serious?

412
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,500
Actually, Su Mingyu and I

413
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,310
have already discussed it.

414
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:53,740
When Liansheng House reopens,

415
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:54,930
you will no longer be the head dealer,

416
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,840
but the manager.

417
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:00,330
But there has never been a precedent in Nandu

418
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,510
of a head dealer being promoted to manager.

419
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:04,130
So what?

420
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,380
I've heard from Tianhu that

421
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,220
even Chairman Su praises you for your talent at doing business.

422
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,270
Who in Liansheng House

423
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,530
is more capable than you?

424
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,580
Although they've bought Liansheng House,

425
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,280
Mr. Su knows nothing about gambling,

426
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,160
and Mr. Yun...

427
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:23,030
wouldn't care about it.

428
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,420
Without your meticulous management,

429
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,390
I'm afraid we'll lose Liansheng House to someone else

430
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,790
in no time.

431
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,920
But I'm of debased status, so I can only work in debased occupations.

432
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,870
I’m afraid

433
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:38,930
this is against the imperial law.

434
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,810
Liansheng House is my property.

435
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,970
Whether it's a manager or a head dealer,

436
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:46,410
it's just a post.

437
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:47,600
There's no such thing as nobility or debasement.

438
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,960
Don't worry.

439
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,960
But I really don't want to transgress.

440
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,180
Don't worry.

441
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,540
You will definitely

442
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,700
be able to handle being the manager.

443
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,260
This is a heavy responsibility.

444
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,050
I won't let you down.

445
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,340
Okay.

446
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,490
Do you know

447
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,060
who you have to thank

448
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:20,830
for this?

449
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,520
I am slow-witted.

450
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,260
Please enlighten me.

451
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,890
You should thank yourself.

452
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:30,990
Although you were of debased status,

453
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,450
you have never acted in a debased manner

454
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:34,780
nor belittled yourself.

455
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,400
You should also thank Mr. Su.

456
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:41,220
Su Mingyu often told us

457
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:44,220
about how even though your background was humble,

458
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,920
you act with more dignity and righteousness than many others.

459
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,570
After interacting with you for a while, I found that

460
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,670
even though Su Mingyu is naive,

461
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:55,260
he is a good judge of character.

462
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,700
Alright.

463
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,030
Thank you, Master and Shu.

464
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:09,980
Manager Ke,

465
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,320
I need you

466
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,700
to help me with something.

467
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,160
Please redecorate the hall within three days.

468
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,780
Bring these wooden furniture to be refreshed

469
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,460
and then put them back.

470
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:19,500
Also,

471
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,740
all the paintings, ornaments, and gambling tools

472
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:23,380
must be replaced with ones one level more sophisticated

473
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:25,060
than those the Tang family used.

474
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,510
Spread the news to the whole city

475
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,460
that Liansheng House is the most high end gambling house

476
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,940
in the whole of Nandu, and even Jiangnan.

477
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,130
Your management style used to be modest and reliable.

478
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,110
Why the sudden change?

479
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,020
Don't ask.

480
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,840
Just do it.

481
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:44,540
Things have changed.

482
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,740
I have my reasons for doing this.

483
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:48,220
It's better to explain after it's all done.

484
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,420
I’ll explain it all to you in the future.

485
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:55,500
Okay.

486
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,230
You must finish decorating within three days.

487
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,540
In the past,

488
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,740
even if Master wanted to demolish Liansheng House and rebuild it,

489
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,100
I would have obeyed.

490
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:08,220
But now, as the manager,

491
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,210
I must give you some advice.

492
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:21,800
Anything else?

493
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:22,490
That’s it.

494
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,220
You thought you could just change out the furniture,

495
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,030
but you didn't know that on such a scale,

496
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,980
it would change our manpower needs.

497
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,740
A servant is enough for a low-stakes gambling table.

498
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,860
If we change them out for high-stakes gambling tables,

499
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:42,680
we would need a head dealer watching over each table.

500
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:45,710
A head dealer costs multiple times of what a servant does.

501
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,620
We would also have to improve our service.

502
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,810
If we improve the quality of our food and drinks,

503
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:54,130
we would need to replace our chefs.

504
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:56,270
Then, there are also the musicians.

505
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,460
Manager Ke,

506
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:00,010
maybe I didn't make myself clear.

507
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:02,300
We're not operating at such a level permanently.

508
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,590
Just half a month is enough.

509
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,530
Half a month?

510
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,940
What happens after that?

511
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,260
Everything will return to normal after half a month.

512
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,460
Then why are you doing this?

513
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,130
You will explain it to us afterwards.

514
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,260
Yes.

515
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,070
That won't do.

516
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,540
The way of business is consistency.

517
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,320
It is difficult to go from extravagance to frugality.

518
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,860
Besides, it is inappropriate

519
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,940
to make the gambling house upscale and then change it back.

520
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:33,250
Moreover, Liansheng House was already in trouble before it closed.

521
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,620
It’s really inappropriate to do this.

522
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:37,910
Master,

523
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,020
I don’t mean to disobey you.

524
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,300
But...

525
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:42,890
I understand.

526
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,670
As a manager, you have the responsibility to advise your master.

527
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,420
Be frank.

528
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:52,820
How much money do you need?

529
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,900
At least 2,500 taels.

530
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,200
That much?

531
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,620
After comparing prices from different stores,

532
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,260
1,000 taels is enough to purchase the items.

533
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,450
If we want to put together a crew,

534
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:10,020
we need to pay them three months' salary as a deposit.

535
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,790
Can we pay them monthly

536
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,620
and make up for it when we turn a profit?

537
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:16,250
It's okay.

538
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,600
Manager Ke.

539
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,280
I'll have to trouble you

540
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,060
to get everything ready as soon as possible.

541
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,020
Remember.

542
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:26,180
Within three days, you must get the news out that

543
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,300
Liansheng House is far superior to the Tangs' Gambling House.

544
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,400
As for the money,

545
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:33,810
I will raise it all by today.

546
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:47,500
Upgrading Liansheng House is just like destroying Yufeng Warehouse.

547
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,940
It's a trick, right?

548
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,320
I destroyed one and am building the other one up.

549
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:53,600
Haven't I improved?

550
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:56,780
But 2,500 taels

551
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,720
is not a small amount.

552
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,610
Where are you going to get that money?

553
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,460
Guanghui Bank?

554
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,260
Guanghui Bank just took over the Cao Sect.

555
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,900
They are still processing the silver.

556
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:06,960
I don't think we can borrow any.

557
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:08,700
What should we do?

558
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,430
You were drunk last night.

559
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,720
You must be very sick now.

560
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,460
Do you want to go to the kitchen and have some hot soup

561
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:17,970
to warm up your stomach?

562
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,650
Okay. I'm actually not feeling well.

563
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:34,990
Come in.

564
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,550
Jin.

565
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,260
You're sleeping?

566
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,550
What do you want? Just tell me.

567
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,660
Liansheng will open for business soon.

568
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,660
I have an interesting idea.

569
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,300
It's different from before.

570
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,260
If we expand on it,

571
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,880
it will be very interesting.

572
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,220
How is it different? Tell me.

573
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,720
How about you give it a try?

574
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:12,870
It's just that no one is betting with me right now,

575
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,160
so I can't perfect the rules.

576
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,380
I thought long and hard about this.

577
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,350
Only your gambling skills

578
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,960
can compete with mine.

579
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:27,700
Let's go and have a try.

580
00:33:27,930 --> 00:33:28,260
Jin.

581
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,300
Since it's a new trick,

582
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:31,940
we'll need real gold and silver

583
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,660
to find the flaws.

584
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:34,830
But don't worry.

585
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:36,300
We'll be playing it safe.

586
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,340
We won't go overboard.

587
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:37,990
Nonsense.

588
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,270
How can we play it safe?

589
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,260
Let's go big.

590
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,020
Sure.

591
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:44,800
Let's go.

592
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:45,990
Ten Taels of Gold.

593
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,930
You really don't learn.

594
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,460
Didn't you go to have soup?

595
00:33:58,190 --> 00:33:59,600
You never change.

596
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,350
We agreed to treat each other with sincerity.

597
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:02,890
Hang on.

598
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,160
Didn't I treat Manager Ke with sincerity?

599
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,780
I have to go step by step

600
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,450
and take my time.

601
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:08,650
You asked me to remind you,

602
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,350
but you're going back on your word.

603
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,139
Girl.

604
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,679
If you hadn't come,

605
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,380
would my hard-earned money

606
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,699
have been swindled away by him?

607
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,659
You're shaking your head.

608
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,610
Jin, it's not true.

609
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,550
Just tell me if you need money.

610
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:33,219
Why are you beating around the bush?

611
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,090
Yes.

612
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,090
I do need some silver.

613
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:40,070
Please help me.

614
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:42,489
No problem.

615
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:45,620
We're brothers. Borrowing money isn't a big deal.

616
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,780
Come on, pay me back ten times.

617
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,429
Write me an IOU.

618
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,580
You're taking advantage of me.

619
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:54,590
You just met me today?

620
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:00,400
Master.

621
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,340
Mr. Kang of Guanghui Bank is here.

622
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,860
He also brought a little girl,

623
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,520
saying she got lost in Jishan Hall.

624
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:15,020
Ling'er, come after me.

625
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:16,360
Give it to me.

626
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:21,030
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

627
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,720
This is the best news I've heard of late.

628
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:26,200
I promised you, there's no need to thank me.

629
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,300
Give it to me.

630
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,180
Come after me.

631
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,230
Give me the windmill.

632
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:35,940
No.

633
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,140
Come on.

634
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:39,380
Yu.

635
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:42,140
Uncle Jin.

636
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,340
Uncle Jin, this is Ling'er.

637
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,760
She's my best friend.

638
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:50,730
Be good, Ling'er.

639
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,820
Let me hug you.

640
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:53,650
No!

641
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:59,260
Ling'er is amazing.

642
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,340
I'm sorry.

643
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,500
This is for you.

644
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,420
Sure.

645
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,220
Mr. Kang.

646
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,460
Mr. Yun.

647
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:20,640
Thank you.

648
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:21,970
Are you feeling better?

649
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:23,090
Much better.

650
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,390
Thank you for your concern.

651
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,390
Any news about the other children?

652
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,940
It's a bit complicated.

653
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:34,100
Those children have either been sold to the black market as slave labor

654
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,600
or to the rich and noble to be groomed.

655
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,800
There are still some we can't find.

656
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:42,970
Why not?

657
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,380
No clues at all?

658
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,980
Since Mr. Mo has an agreement with you,

659
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:47,820
I will do my best to investigate.

660
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,370
But you should know very well

661
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,390
that once the children go to those places,

662
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,150
they might not still be alive.

663
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:56,900
I won't disturb you any longer.

664
00:36:57,570 --> 00:36:58,600
I'll come and report to you if there's any news.

665
00:36:59,290 --> 00:36:59,680
Goodbye.

666
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,300
Did you ask the people from Guanghui Bank to help?

667
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,250
Jin,

668
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,220
don't worry too much.

669
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:11,820
It's just that we can't find them yet.

670
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,850
Guanghui Bank is well-connected in Nandu.

671
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,420
With their help, it's definitely possible.

672
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,960
Take the money.

673
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:19,810
30% interest.

674
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,080
I can't go any lower.

675
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:29,980
Look.

676
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,010
You're reaping what you've sowed.

677
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,050
You

678
00:37:33,410 --> 00:37:34,930
should do good deeds more often.

679
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:46,660
Young man!

680
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:52,410
The longer we wait, the more dangerous it is for the children.

681
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,100
Is there anything I can help with?

682
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:58,430
Indeed, a little girl was sold as a servant.

683
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,340
But the rich merchant didn't allow me to redeem her.

684
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,910
He's an old customer of Guanghui Bank.

685
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,470
I see.

686
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,490
Which bastard is he?

687
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,650
Leave him to me.

688
00:38:08,340 --> 00:38:09,180
So...

689
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:11,710
someone took away

690
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,740
the document of Miss Ke's debased status from the Music Office.

691
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,080
I was wondering

692
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,450
if it was the Young Master

693
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,250
who made that happen.

694
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,190
If he were that capable,

695
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,420
he would have married Miss Ke long ago.

696
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,620
I'll ask around

697
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:33,420
and figure this out.

698
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:36,780
Don't tell Mingyu about this today.

699
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:40,440
I have something important to entrust to him today.

700
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,790
Master, have some water.

701
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:54,770
Your breathing

702
00:38:55,090 --> 00:38:56,320
has stabilized quite a bit.

703
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:03,140
What I'm worried about now is the whole Cao Sect.

704
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:06,980
Master,

705
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,660
it doesn't matter if you have lost your martial arts skills.

706
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,160
You used to protect us.

707
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,820
We'll protect you from now on.

708
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:13,860
Okay.

709
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,660
We have gathered some money

710
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,130
for the travel expenses.

711
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,890
There are more than ten of our men outside.

712
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,470
You can make a comeback.

713
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,900
I’ve thought about it.

714
00:39:25,330 --> 00:39:27,380
Nandu is not a place for us to stay for long.

715
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:28,930
How about this?

716
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:32,420
Would the men be willing to travel upriver

717
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,850
to Ba Shu?

718
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,340
Sure.

719
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,850
The water network in Ba Shu is dense

720
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,580
and requires lesser labor than Jiangnan.

721
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:41,640
In less than three to five years,

722
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,220
we can build ourselves back up.

723
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:43,980
Who asked you to come?

724
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,530
Who is it?

725
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,100
Yufeng Warehouse

726
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:51,850
was burned by Miss Shu?

727
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:52,950
Most likely.

728
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,060
But if that's true,

729
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,590
it would also have been Young Master Xiang's order.

730
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,100
Why did Yun Xiang do that?

731
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,580
He caused such a big stir,

732
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,060
but the Su family benefited in the end.

733
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,370
You are wrong.

734
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:05,540
Mo Bufan was the biggest winner.

735
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:18,450
Master Guan.

736
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:19,840
What are you doing?

737
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,100
Take him out.

738
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:21,830
-Yes.
-Yes.

739
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,730
Let him go!

740
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:23,100
Go!

741
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,260
Don't hurt Master!

742
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,820
We have no grudge against you.

743
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,860
Why must you kill us all?

744
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,980
How can there be no grudge?

745
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,080
I betrayed you.

746
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,730
You're a man who always takes revenge.

747
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,650
If you make a comeback,

748
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:39,830
I'd be in trouble.

749
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,300
If you're worried about me,

750
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:42,620
you can kill me right now.

751
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:43,990
But spare my men!

752
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,000
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

753
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:51,300
It's too late.

754
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:53,140
You...

755
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:15,340
Forget it.

756
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:17,830
You're all alone, and a cripple.

757
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,720
You can't cause any trouble.

758
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,210
I'll spare your life.

759
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:31,980
Let's go!

760
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,020
Let's drink and eat meat!

761
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,960
I don't know how to treat Yun Xiang now.

762
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:49,670
That's exactly what I wanted to tell you.

763
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,940
Don't distance yourself from him,

764
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,100
and take advantage of your old friendship

765
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,060
to get closer to him.

766
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:57,880
But why?

767
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,550
I treated him as a friend,

768
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,390
but he used me.

769
00:42:04,170 --> 00:42:04,860
Mingyu.

770
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:09,110
Although Yun Xiang used the Su family's power,

771
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:12,900
he never put us at risk.

772
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:13,940
In my opinion,

773
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,800
he's not our enemy.

774
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:20,260
You want me to get close to him

775
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:21,740
to see what he'll do next?

776
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:23,900
No.

777
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,420
You can't

778
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,100
scheme against such a smart person.

779
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:28,960
So,

780
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,900
you should treat him with sincerity

781
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,500
as you always have.

782
00:42:36,290 --> 00:42:40,260
Only in this way can the Su family be safe.

783
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:25,620
Gui!

784
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:43,900
Brothers!

785
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:48,240
Is there anyone alive?
