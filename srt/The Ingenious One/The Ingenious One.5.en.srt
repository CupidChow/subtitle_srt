Are you scared?

Tang Xiao's two guards

20
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,200
are indeed capable warriors.

21
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,170
The male guard is Zhong.

22
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,300
I've never seen him fight before,

23
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:39,060
so I don't know his specific fighting style.

24
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:41,450
But I think he's Japanese.

25
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,340
Why?

26
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:44,960
Last year,

27
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,920
some veterans from the government

28
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:49,700
smashed up one of the Tang family's shops.

29
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:51,660
They were found dead at the riverside that night.

30
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,770
Their swords were all cleaved.

31
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,270
The cuts on their armor were clean.

32
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,380
Those were typically caused by Japanese swordsmen.

33
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,850
Tang Xiao killed those soldiers.

34
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:00,810
How come no one was after him?

35

And Tang Xiao

37
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,000
has many connections in the government.

38
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,600
Therefore, the government killed several prisoners as scapegoats.

39
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,390
That's all.

40
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,290
What about the other guard?

41
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,820
She dresses quite differently from us.

42
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,420
Her name is Meizhu.

43
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:17,820
It is said that she was born in the far north.

44
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,570
I even fought with her once.

46
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,290
This happened three years ago.

47
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:35,600
Back then, there was a man called Li Baiwan.

48
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:37,330
He was known as the best needle user.

49
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:39,680
He had a grudge against Tang Xiao,

50
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,400
so he summoned his men to fight Tang Xiao.

No, no. Continue.

53
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,890
Meizhu is good at using blunt weapons

54
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,900
and the method of martial arts she uses is unique.

55
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,940
Anyway,

56
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,410
she has something wrapped around her hands and arms.

57
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:02,430
Her attacking style is overbearing.

58
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,640
She's very strong.

59
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:04,910
But her movements are not sophisticated.

60
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,540
Even though she was attacked by a group of warriors,

61
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,250
she stayed unhurt.

62
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,190
How about Li Baiwan?

63
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:11,900
He went all out.

64
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,830
He used his Three Meteor Shower Moves.

65
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,930
Immediately, needles flew in the air, cutting raindrops and breaking stones,

66
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,910
just like the falling stars.

67
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,250
How did Meizhu react?

68
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,590
She just used her arms to cover her eyes.

69
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,260
She wasn't afraid of his needles at all.

70
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,990
Li Baiwan gave an evil grin.

71
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,630
He looked like a demon.

72
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:59,030
She's really a top warrior.

73
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,600
Without any hesitation, I used

74
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:05,820
my Wandering Step,

00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,030
jumping off from three stories high.

76
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,350
She was so immersed in killing

77
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:22,310
and attacked me without any reason.

78
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,860
I used the Dragon Sword to dissolve her momentum.

79
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,280
I was not afraid of her at all.

80
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,000
Anyway,

81
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,100
if you don't fight with her yourself,

82
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,000
you won't understand how strong she is.

83
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,659
You can't figure it out by only watching.

84
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:38,330
If you consider that as "fighting with her",

85
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,980
I can brag I conquered the martial world.

86
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,840
At least I had a combat with her.

87
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,070

00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,650

89
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,980

90
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,409
Qi Tianfeng?

91
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,130
He's really a top martial artist.

92
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:54,680
He's known as the Iron Hand Demon.

93
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,040
His Twelve Wave-breaking Palms are almost invincible in Nandu.

94
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,190
But all these years of fighting

95
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:01,300
left him injured.

96
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,970
I've never heard him fight with anyone again.

97
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:05,730
Why are you asking about Qi Tianfeng?

98
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,250
Qi Tianfeng is famous.

99
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,050

If I want to fight with Qi Tianfeng,

103
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,730
I have to practice for a few more years.

104
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:29,780
According to what you just said,

105
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,510

Don't worry.

109
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,090
No matter how arrogant Tang Xiao is,

110
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,630
he doesn't dare to provoke the Su family,

We had some misunderstandings.

116
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,850
But now I know you are a righteous man.

117
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,670
Although you don't know martial arts, you have a warrior's heart.

118
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:04,960
Here.

119
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,380
That's enough.

120
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,310
Cut the crap.

121
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,420
Let's get down to business.

122
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:17,930

I've handed my 3,000 taels to the Chamber of Commerce.

126
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,350
When you fill in the other 3,000 taels,

127
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,700
we can get the deed.

128
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:29,880
What's the deadline for that?

129
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,559
What do you mean?

130
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:35,380
Can't you understand?

131
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:37,049
Does he look like he's rich?

132
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,990
I'm just asking about the time.

133
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,390
As stipulated by the Chamber of Commerce,

134
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,470
all procedures should be done before five.

135
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,810
The deal will be canceled after five o'clock

136
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,650

137
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,160

Please forgive me.

148
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,640
You don't have other choices now.

149
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,180
Mr. Su, please calm down.

150
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,120
You can take a rest in the Chamber of Commerce.

151
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,760
I will get the money

152
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:36,840
and send it to the Chamber of Commerce in time.

153
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,670
Okay, I'll wait for you.

154
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:05,630
Waiter.

155
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:07,870
I have a task for you.

156
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,240
I'll tell you a place.

157
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,010
Send the food on the table and this

158
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,150
to that place.

159
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,090
Okay, thank you.

160
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:23,420
Su Mingyu

161
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,320
talked a good game about martial arts,

162
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,910
but he's just a lightweight.

163
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,670
I tried him just now.

164
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,460
He immediately flinched.

165
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:31,710
He's just like you.

166
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:34,120
Only 30% of what you say is true.

167
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,380
30%?

168
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,960
I'd say you think too highly of me.

169
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:40,990
None of you is completely honest.

170
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,460
How about this?

171
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,030
We terminate our agreement.

172
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,250
I'll take a few orders to make some money.

173
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,400
Then I'll pay you back, okay?

174
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,340
Will you leave

175
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,130
when you complete your revenge?

176
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:06,670
Of course.

177
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:13,570
What's wrong?

178
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,350
Nothing. I was just asking.

179
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,170
Every sentence you say

180
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,040
has a purpose.

181
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,040
What?

182
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:30,130
What?

183
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:30,890
Come here.

184
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,540
What do you want to do?

185
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,390
Don't mention Qi Tianfeng

186
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,500
in front of Su Mingyu again.

187
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,460
I can see you intentionally interrupted me.

188
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:57,030
But I don't know why.

189
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,850
Think about this. Meizhu once fought Su Mingyu.

190
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,470
Why didn't Tang Xiao, who is so unruly,

191
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,200
kill Su Mingyu?

192
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,320
He must be afraid of the Su family's status.

193
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:09,970
Yes.

194
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,230
What else did you notice

195
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,720
during the auction?

196
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,340
Although Tang Xiao was humiliated,

197
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,620
he didn't offend Su Mingyu.

198
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,990
It can be seen that the Su family has a high status.

199
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,440
So, we are not only using Su Mingyu

200
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,740
to help us cross the river.

201
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,590
I didn't want to say this.

202
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,220
But I'm really afraid that you'll be too impatient

203
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,120
and let the cat out of the bag.

204
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,530
But thanks to my question,

205
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:39,120
at least I know that Qi Tianfeng is suffering from old injuries

206
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,280
and he's not as powerful as he used to be.

207
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,700
Using force is not the only way to achieve revenge.

208
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:44,790
At this point, I can tell you

209
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:45,760
I'm only one step away

210
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,290
from finishing my plan.

211
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,450
Trust me.

212
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,080
Get the 3,000 taels

213
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:55,660
in four hours first.

214
00:12:59,180 --> 00:12:59,810
Sit back.

215
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:03,200
You sit over there.

216
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,580
I want to show you something.

217
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,440
It's very important.

218
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:57,750
We're here.

219
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,500
[Guanghui Bank]

220
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,740
Wait here for a moment.

221
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,480
Godfather is gone.

222
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,740
You want to get 3,000 taels

223
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,240
with those invoices?

224
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:21,470
Maybe. Maybe not.

225
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:25,570
So mysterious. I don't believe you can.

226
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,220
I think he just wants to buy time.

227
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,220
It's a mere formality.

228
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,320
Jin.

229
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,420
You wanna bet?

230
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,320
Bet?

231
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:43,630
On what?

232
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,800
If I can't get 3,000 taels

233
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,840
within two hours,

234
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,310
you and I will be even.

235
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,420
Don't fall for his trick.

236
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:58,730
Do you have money deposited here?

237
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,200
No.

238
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,490
Do you have any mortgageable property?

239
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,030
No.

240
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,330
You know any rich men in Nandu?

241
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,200
Only one. Su Mingyu.

242
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:10,550
Fine.

243
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:13,020
If you get 3,000 taels,

244
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,940
I'll work for you for several more months.

245
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:15,920
If you can't,

246
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:18,290
we'll be even.

247
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:20,790
Deal.

248
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,450
Don't shake your head for him.

249
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,110
You ask me for 3,000 taels of silver

250
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,890
with these old papers?

251
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:41,930
Ridiculous!

252
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,130
Mr. Wen is gone.

253
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,240
His assets should belong to Yuntai Sect.

254
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:46,260
But most of them

255
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,960
are now in your hands.

256
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,410
What do you think Master will do

257
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,220
if he knows about this?

258
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:09,800
Mr. Mo,

259
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,250
even if you've only taken back

260
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,390
70% of the loans Mr. Wen gave out,

261
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,120
that's tens of thousands of taels.

262
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,750
Even if I have tens of millions of taels,

263
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:19,810
it has nothing to do with you.

264
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:22,130
You came to Nandu without permission

265
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,540
and intervened in Wen Cong's affairs.

266
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:24,760
Yun Xiang.

267
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:27,230
I don't want to make you look bad

268
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,970
because you're Master's direct disciple.

269
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,610
Without permission?

270
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,360
Does that mean I need your permission

271
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,620
to come to Nandu?

272
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,320
Master asked you to take care of things in Yuezhou.

273
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,910
He never sent you here to make Wen Cong your business.

274
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,320
You're really well-informed.

275
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:46,710
Yun Xiang.

276
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,390
I'm being nice.

277
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:50,810
Don't push your luck.

278
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,820
Are you trying to blackmail me?

279
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,120
Behave yourself.

280
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,660
If I don't give you the 3,000 taels,

281
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,730
will you report me to Master,

282
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,690
accusing me of embezzlement?

283
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,280
Are you going to say I'm looking on

284
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,339
when Master's property is at risk?

285
00:17:07,990 --> 00:17:08,579
Brat.

286
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,280
I've been working hard for the sect

287
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,740
in Nandu for many years.

288
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,109
So what if you're Master's direct disciple?

289
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,700
You can't say Master trust me or you more.

290
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,589
Let's each write a letter to him

291
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,710
and see who he trusts.

292
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:21,910
Why are you smiling?

293
00:17:24,569 --> 00:17:27,230
Mr. Mo, you and I are the same kind of people.

294
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,110
I want power and you want money.

295
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,980
I already know your intention.

296
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,800
What's that about?

297
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:43,880
A 5% monthly interest rate.

298
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,290
I borrow 3,000 taels from you

299
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:49,500
at an interest rate of 5%.

300
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,640
I'll pay you back in a month.

301
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,560
What about 10%?

302
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,850
I can see you're truly desperate.

303
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,270
Even 10% is not intriguing enough to you?

304
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,930
How about this?

305
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,750
For every tael I borrow, I'll pay you ten back.

306
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,330
If I can't pay you back within a month,

307
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,570
I'm at your disposal.

308
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,050
Why hasn't he come out yet?

309
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,970
We can take bets as well. What do you think?

310
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,370
I don't think you stand a chance.

311
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,680
I didn't expect to part ways with you so suddenly.

312
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,260
Goodbye, Yun Xiang.

313
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,550
Are you really leaving?

314
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,540
A bet is a bet.

315
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,320
See you.

316
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:05,960
If you leave,

317
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:07,580
I'll be in danger without your protection.

318
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,260
You still have Shu Yanan.

319
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:13,910
Jin,

320
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:14,860
you are the real hero

321
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,300
in my heart.

322
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:24,560
Well...

323
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:25,700
Mr. Yun.

324
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,420
Mr. Yun.

325
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,020
This is from Mr. Mo.

326
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,620
You don't want to leave me, right?

327
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,110
Seeing you shaking your head is annoying.

328
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,750
Bite me!

329
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:06,770
Mr. Mo of Guanghui Bank is also on your side?

330
00:20:08,430 --> 00:20:09,210
That's not what matters.

331
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,050
What matters is that it's a money house.

332
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,610
Did you borrow the money?

333
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,370
You have assets that can be mortgaged?

334
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,130
I promised to pay ten times back.

335
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:22,620
What else should I mortgage?

336
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,690
Ten times?

337
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,610
That means you have to repay 30,000 taels.

338
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:29,410
In a month

339
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:33,990
You are too bold.

340
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,220
I just want to make it quick.

341
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,950
Tell me what your next move is.

342
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,610
There's something I need your help with.

343
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:49,230
Uncle, it's true that

344
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,060
some of Wen Cong's debt has been paid.

345
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,060
But I remember

346
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,940
because of the money he owed us back then,

347
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,980
you almost closed your business.

348
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,220
Why didn't you tell Yun Xiang about this?

349
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,140
Would it help?

350
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,380
Would he believe it?

351
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:03,460
Yun Xiang bought Liansheng House with six thousand taels.

352
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,280
To pay for that, he promised to pay you ten times back.

353
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,050
He is really strange.

354
00:21:09,870 --> 00:21:10,780
Anyway,

355
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,460
if he repays 30,000 taels as promised,

356
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,740
it will be an unexpected fortune.

357
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,450
What if he can't pay it back?

358
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:18,630
Will he really leave Nandu?

359
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,030
I can't see through him yet.

360
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,780
But after this,

361
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:28,290
we can't be friends.

362
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,340
That's all.

363
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:34,210
Okay.

364
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:35,700
After you go back,

365
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:36,950
thank Warrior Jin for me.

366
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,280
Thank you for your trouble.

367
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,210
We won't walk you out then.

368
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,720
May I use the toilet?

369
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,360
Isn't there supposed to be more than ten kids?

370
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,530
Uncle.

371
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:09,000
Please take me with you.

372
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,230
Little girl,

373
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,620
what's wrong with you?

374
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,250
So troublesome.

375
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,140
Dear.

376
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,050
I don't think Jin Biao

377
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,540
will leave Nandu soon.

378
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,800
It will be a problem if someone else comes again.

379
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,740
Let's leave then.

380
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:49,370
We can do our business anywhere.

381
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,180
Coward!

382
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:51,470
Even if we run away from Jin Biao today,

383
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:54,390
there is always someone else after us.

384
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:55,390
Then should we keep running?

385
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,180
It's not the first time that

386
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,990
a swordsman has targeted us.

[Nandu Chamber of Commerce]

388
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,630
Who knows how long he'll be in there.

389
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,250
Why don't you take a rest in the carriage?

390
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,590
I'll find a place to drink.

391
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,190
You wait here.

392
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,580
I have something to do.

393
00:23:29,350 --> 00:23:31,370
I've counted all the six thousand taels.

394
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,110
This is the deed of Liansheng House.

395
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,200
Please have a look.

396
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,850
If there is no problem,

397
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,080
you can sign it.

398
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,500
Qian, please stamp the official seal of the Chamber of Commerce.

399
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,730
Then come with me to the room inside.

400
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,550
The chairman is waiting for you too.

401
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:22,540
It's done.

402
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:30,790
Sister,

403
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,340
you look thinner.

404
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,250
You've been avoiding me

405
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,910
since you came back from Yangzhou.

406
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:44,730
Liansheng House is not worth 6,000 taels.

407
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:45,420
I know that. But...

408
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,420
Let's not talk about this.

409
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,350
Mingyu,

410
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,740
are you serious about that girl?

411
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,970
You insisted on buying Liansheng House

412
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,390
because you want to give that girl

413
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,080
a place to stay?

414
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,630
Yes. I mean it.

415
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,600
I only care about her.

416
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,750
I'm a commoner and she's not. Our marriage is not allowed.

417
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,300
I'll find a way to make her a commoner.

418
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:17,210
It's not an easy thing.

419
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:20,650
What do you plan to do now?

420
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,210
For now, I can only keep her from being bullied by Tang Xiao.

421
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,370
No other specific plans have been made.

422
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,930
I can help you.

423
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,120
Are you okay with it?

424
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,780
I've been strict with you

425
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:47,020
because I worried it's just a spur-of-the-moment thing to you.

426
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,720
But I've seen what you did in the past two years.

427
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:54,810
It's a good thing if you have someone in your heart.

428
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,460
It would be a pity

429
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,940
if you can't spend more time together

430
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,210
just because of differences in social status.

431
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,990
But you have to promise me one thing.

432
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,010
What is it?

433
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,070
I can help Miss Ke to be a commoner.

434
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:14,420
But you need to learn to do business.

435
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,550
Because in the future,

436
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,430
you have to take care of the business of our family.

00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:26,650
Mr. Su.

439
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:28,980
You're home.

440
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,600
You bought Liansheng House as you wished.

441
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,270
You can win her heart with that. Why are you unhappy?

442
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,660
Don't you like her anymore because you've got what you want?

443
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,420
If that's the case,

444
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,660
I'll...

445
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:48,520
You two gentlemen have saved Liansheng House.

446
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,410
I thank you on behalf of all the girls.

447
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,870
Mr. Yun, you are an amazing gambler.

448
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,770
I'm glad you are the new owner of Liansheng House.

449
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:05,980
I'm flattered.

451
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,740
I don't know how to thank you.

452
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,800
I prepared some wine.

453
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,310
Please go upstairs and enjoy.

454
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:20,380
Am I invited too?

455
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,360
Of course.

456
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:52,210
Miss Ke,

457
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,280
this is now my place as well.

458
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,330
You don't have to follow me.

459
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:57,550
I want to show Jin around.

460
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:00,480
Please go ahead.

461
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:02,970
Go.

462
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,890
I have something to tell you.

463
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:33,480
Please.

464
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,570
Menglan. Menglan.

465
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,240
Why are you not as close to me as before?

466
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:50,880
If I made you misunderstand in the past,

467
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,660
it was my fault.

468
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,180
I thank you very much

469
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,510
for buying Liansheng House.

470
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,450
I'll do my best to work for you in the future.

471
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,680
That's all.

472
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,060
I hope you can understand.

473
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:05,550
Why?

474
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,410
Why are you confused?

475
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,520
If some Mr. Zhang or Mr. Liu bought this place,

476
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:13,260
should I offer myself as well?

477
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,750
Is this a business regulation

478
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:17,450
or any unspoken rule?

479
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,750
But I'm not them.

480
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,650
Menglan.

481
00:29:31,530 --> 00:29:32,550
I never asked you before.

482
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,200
I'll ask you only once.

483
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:35,930
Do you like me?

484
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,530
Love in the world, in very rare cases,

485
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:45,660
is as firm as a rock.

486
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:48,780
Most of the time, it's like a floating cloud.

487
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,290
Don't bother yourself with it.

488
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:52,680
Menglan.

489
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:58,300
You don't have to trust others.

490
00:29:58,690 --> 00:29:59,620
But can you trust me?

491
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,620
Please let go of me.

492
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,530
Miss Shu.

493
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:09,900
You're back.

494
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:11,950
I'll go with you.

495
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:23,690
We accidentally entered that inn.

496
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,400
There were soldiers outside and bandits inside.

497
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,630
It was a mess. Sabers, swords, and arrows.

498
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,280
But with your martial skills,

499
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,600
you should be able to get out.

500
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,900
Of course.

501
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:41,360
But the two young men who were with me couldn't.

502
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,200
We were there together.

503
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:45,990
How could I escape on my own?

504
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,040
Right?

505
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,110
Here, fill it up for me.

506
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,660
I'm captivated by the story. Sorry.

507
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,130
It doesn't matter.

508
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,240
I told them,

509
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:57,930
"Guys,

510
00:30:58,810 --> 00:31:00,520
there's only one way out today.

511
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,940
Let's swim out of this latrine."

512
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:06,740
Then we swam out.

513
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,350
What are you talking about?

514
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,270
If it's a joke, tell it again.

515
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,560
Perfect timing.

516
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,430
Jin is sharing one of his experiences.

517
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,400
-He once... -Shut up.

518
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,950
How can you tell this to Miss Ke?

519
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,630
It's too rude for girls.

520
00:31:23,430 --> 00:31:25,160
I don't know what kind of joke it is,

521
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:27,360
but this is the first time

522
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:29,410
that I have seen Tianhu smile like this.

523
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:37,340
Miss Ke,

524
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,940
this toast is for you.

525
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:41,760
We hit it off.

526
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,970
I'll help you

527
00:31:44,310 --> 00:31:44,950
if anyone comes to make trouble.

528
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,010
Thank you.

529
00:31:47,230 --> 00:31:49,590
With Mr. Yun as the owner of Liansheng House,

530
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,470
I'm sure everything will go smoothly in the future.

531
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:56,290
Cheers.

532
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,960
The dulcet music and the bright moon.

533
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,870
How beautiful!

534
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,460
Such scenery is priceless.

535
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:21,410
A wonderful picture on such a lovely night.

536
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,260
But it seems to be a pity

537
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:24,480
without a beauty by your side.

538
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:25,850
You're wrong.

539
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:29,040
You said it

540
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,840
in a too flippant manner.

541
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,450
There are so many injustices in the world.

542
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,530
Sad love life is not a big deal.

543
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,060
I feel sad for you, in fact.

544
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,430
Look at you.

545
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,250
You don't have...

546
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,210
Your heart is stone.

547
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,670
Do you know

548
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:50,990
why Miss Ke is keeping a distance from you?

549
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,040
You're not an open-hearted person.

550
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,430
You have so many secrets.

551
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:59,350
But there are things only you can see through.

552
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:04,340
Maybe I can even provide solutions.

553
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:05,840
I do have one thing on my mind.

554
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,150
Can you keep it a secret for me?

555
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,420
My sister is willing to help Menglan be a commoner.

556
00:33:14,970 --> 00:33:17,650
She also agreed that I can marry Menglan.

557
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,790
Under what conditions?

558
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,210
She asked me to learn to do business

559
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,490
and take over the family business.

560
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,930
This problem can be solved.

561
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,560
Can you

562
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:43,790
help Menglan change her status

563
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:44,860
without the help of my sister?

564
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,780
To do that, you need connections in the Music Department.

565
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,750
As the big boss of the gambling industry in Nandu,

566
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,120
Tang Xiao definitely has the connections you want.

567
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,260
You want to ask Tang Xiao for help?

568
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,530
You're walking straight into a lion's den.

569
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:00,130
He wanted Menglan to be his concubine

570
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,550
if he made Menglan a commoner.

571
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,640
The conditions are negotiable.

572
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:04,530
Mr. Su.

573
00:34:05,890 --> 00:34:06,720
If you trust me,

574
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,780
why don't you leave it to me?

575
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:11,530
[Cao Sect]

576
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:25,710
[Su's Silk Warehouse]

577
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,159
[Yufeng Warehouse]

578
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:02,890
Here.

579
00:35:19,290 --> 00:35:22,930
Fire! Fire!

580
00:35:22,930 --> 00:35:24,250
Help!

581
00:35:25,950 --> 00:35:27,220
Actually, I've come up with an idea.

582
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,110
But I still need an opportunity.

583
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,130
Flames there are shooting up.

584
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,210
There seems to be a lot of flammable things.

585
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,090
This direction...

586
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,170
That's my family's silk warehouse.
