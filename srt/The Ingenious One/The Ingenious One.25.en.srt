00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,880
Let's follow this lead.

192
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,240
I think we'll find the rest of the children soon.

193
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,050
I'll call you Warrior Su from now on.

194
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,760
You learned a lot from one lesson.

195
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:36,060
I think you have the talent to be a teacher.

196
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,890
Brother Su is a good teacher.

197
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,420
I can't.

198
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,870
You're little troublemakers.

199
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,600
I've found a proper teacher.

200
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:46,710
He'll be here in a few days.

201
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,370
Aren't you producing the tributary cloth?

202
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,000
Why do you have time to come here?

203
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,500
Everything is ready over there.

204
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,230
I don't have to make it myself anyway.

205
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,760
Why didn't you visit Liansheng House?

206
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,190
I'm not going there.

207
00:15:59,660 --> 00:16:01,650
Yun will come and see me if he needs anything.

208
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,630
I don't want to remind him

209
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:05,120
that he can make use of me, right?

210
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,040
You boy.

211
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,660
You're finally smart.

212
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:11,600
Sister.

213
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,940
How did you braid my hair today?

214
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:16,810
Xiaoyu's hair is not long enough.

215
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:20,140
It needs to grow longer to be braided into styles.

216
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:24,270
So remember to eat well

217
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,350
and sleep well.

218
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,400
Then your hair can grow faster.

219
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,860
Then I need to grow up quickly

220
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:31,750
and grow my hair.

221
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,990
I still want Sister Shu to braid my hair.

222
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,880
Xiaoyu is the best.

223
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,950
Xiaoyu was the first one here.

224
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,200
You and Jiabao should take care of

225
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,140
other brothers and sisters.

226
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,840
Look at you.

227
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,550
You're so thoughtful today.

228
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:54,800
Let's build a swing in this yard.

229
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,600
Take good care of the teacher as well.

230
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,710
As long as he settles here,

231
00:16:58,810 --> 00:16:59,930
we can feel more assured.

232
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,390
These children have undergone many hardships.

233
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:05,599
The caretaker shouldn't change frequently.

234
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:09,550
You only talk

235
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,069
but you don't come and help out.

236
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,339
Come on.

237
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,819
Let's play cuju.

238
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,200
Come on.

239
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:20,390
Let's go.

240
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,410
My turn. My turn.

241
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,700
Pass it to me.

242
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,920
Sister went to the Jishan Hall to help.

243
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:00,750
Jishan Hall?

244
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:04,140
It's the new name of Jishan Hall.

245
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,220
Jin named it.

246
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:09,330
Good name.

247
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,690
When did Yanan go there?

248
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,510
About half past six.

249
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,430
Does Master miss Miss?

250
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,970
I know I shouldn't ask.

251
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,310
But these days,

252
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,200
why are Master and Miss

253
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,160
always avoiding each other?

254
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,060
No.

255
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,990
We were together yesterday.

256
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,220
Although you were together,

257
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:47,730
you were emotionally distant.

258
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,060
Master. Manager.

259
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,520
There is a guest.

260
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,570
It's obvious that she disguised herself as a man.

261
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,430
She lost 1,000 taels within half an hour.

262
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:06,820
She lost at every move.

263
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,860
It seems she did it on purpose.

264
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,800
I'm afraid she's here for trouble.

265
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,040
Let's have a look.

266
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,260
Sir, according to

267
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,730
the rules of the Chamber of Commerce,

268
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,670
we only accept silver taels or silver certificates.

269
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:24,950
You...

270
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,130
Ridiculous.

271
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,790
How am I going to recoup my losses like this?

272
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,470
Miss,

273
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,270
I guess you're out of luck today.

274
00:19:32,990 --> 00:19:33,970
Why don't you come another day?

275
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:34,850
Who are you?

276
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,360
I'm the Master of Liansheng House.

277
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:39,790
Master?

278
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:50,210
[King Fu's Family should not be interfered in and out of the palace when being on duty]

279
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,230
If Liansheng House wins this jade pendant,

280
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,590
I'm afraid I'll end up in prison.

281
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,290
Please show mercy, Your Highness.

282
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,660
My name is not written on it.

283
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,230
How did you know?

284
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,770
Since you already know who I am,

285
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,070
how dare you talk to me like that?

286
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:21,680
What if you'll be penalised for being disrespectful?

287
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,270
Sir,

288
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:25,880
would you like to

289
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,530
have a chat upstairs?

290
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,330
Since Young Master Xiang of Nandu invited me personally,

291
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:39,410
I won't refuse.

292
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,890
Come on.

293
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:45,700
Let's go on.

294
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,130
Enjoy.

295
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,400
Tell me.

296
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:10,180
How did you know who I was?

297
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,320
King Fu is known for being loyal to love.

298
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,630
When Her Highness was severely ill,

299
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:18,570
King Fu swore to never marry again.

300
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,680
He kept his promise until now.

301
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,380
Just now I saw "King Fu's Family",

302
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,560
which was carved on the jade pendant.

303
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,070
As far as I know,

304
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,800
the princess is the only female figure

305
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,770
in King Fu's family.

306
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,160
How dare you peasant

307
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,520
talk about the royal family affairs?

308
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,720
I dare not.

309
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,740
I just want to answer your question.

310
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,300
Will you answer

311
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:44,750
anything I ask you with honesty?

312
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,030
Of course.

313
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,060
What's your relationship

314
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:50,930
with that female manager?

315
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:54,990
She is the manager of Liansheng House.

316
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,220
I'm the Master of Liansheng House.

317
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:58,800
That's all.

318
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,730
Is Your Highness satisfied with my answer?

319
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,000
Sit down.

320
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:13,690
Thank you, Your Highness.

321
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,350
Don't say thank you.

322
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,050
Apologize to me first.

323
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,690
I came to visit you.

324
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,650
But several pages told me

325
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,480
Mr. Yun never meets guests.

326
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,590
Now I understand.

327
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,000
If Your Highness only wins and never loses,

328
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:46,440
you'll probably be treated as a cheater and get evicted.

329
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,330
But Your Highness only loses and never wins.

330
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:52,720
Your Highness spent a lot of money and had no intention to stop.

331
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,340
Such an unusual guest

332
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,690
will surely arouse the suspicion of the Master.

333
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,560
You lost 1,000 taels in a row

334
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,550
solely to draw me out.

335
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:05,380
You are indeed smart and sharp.

336
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:09,760
As expected of Yun Xiang.

337
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,000
In just over a month, you've become famous.

338
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,870
You're indeed quite clever.

339
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:17,050
But I still don't understand.

340
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:20,360
Why did you want to use this badge

341
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,050
as collateral?

342
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,970
If I hadn't found out in time,

343
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,360
I'm afraid I'd be in big trouble.

344
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,170
But no one has ever asked me to wait for an hour.

345
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,010
I wanted to teach you a lesson,

346
00:23:33,390 --> 00:23:34,810
but you were lucky.

347
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,840
You came at the right time.

348
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:38,550
I see.

349
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,220
Am I questioning you? Or are you questioning me?

350
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,070
I dare not.

351
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:46,600
I think Your Highness has a prestigious status.

352
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:49,260
It's too risky

353
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,440
to come here alone.

354
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:54,530
I wonder if Lord Liu came with you.

355
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,620
Why did Mr. Yun follow the pleasure boat last night?

356
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:11,180
It must be

357
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,770
because of the money in the boat.

358
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,080
As for the robbery of official silver,

359
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,000
it must be related to Mo Bufan, Mr. Yun's friend.

360
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,040
Your Highness really came prepared.

361
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:27,860
I also heard from Magistrate Shao

362
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,950
the official silver stolen a few days ago

363
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,340
was paid back by Mr. Su.

364
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,150
Yun Xiang,

365
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,300
how many accomplices do you have in Nandu?

366
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:39,630
The female manager

367
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,420
doesn't seem to have an affair with you.

368
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,930
Is she also your accomplice?

369
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,060
Your Highness.

370
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,100
She's not my accomplice.

371
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,680
We're just friends in business.

372
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:55,880
Enough with the excuses.

373
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,140
Yun Xiang,

374
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,980
it's better if you tell me now.

375
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,920
If my uncle comes,

376
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,050
you might not be able to survive.

377
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,120
Remember.

378
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,970
Yun Xiang is not an ordinary person.

379
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,050
He won't use ordinary means.

380
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,020
I understand. As usual.

381
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,070
My lord is the good cop. I'll be the bad cop.

382
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,670
Go upstairs and help.

383
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,530
Prepare the tea and dessert.

384
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,340
Be considerate and treat them well.

385
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,130
Girl.

386
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:01,800
Sir.

387
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:04,910
Is Mr. Yun here?

388
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:07,260
Mr. Yun is receiving his guest.

389
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,150
He specially asked us not to disturb him.

390
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,160
What kind of special guest?

391
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,200
Lead us the way.

392
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,220
If you keep barging in,

393
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,590
I'll tell the officials.

394
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:28,490
Move.

395
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,070
This is the place.

396
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:32,980
Move.

397
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,080
Move.

398
00:27:11,130 --> 00:27:12,600
Uncle, I'll leave this to you.

399
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:23,870
Leave now.

400
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,100
Your Highness.

401
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:31,620
My lord said it last time that

402
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,800
you can't get involved in these things.

403
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,400
I just wanted to help you

404
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:36,570
get more information

405
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,900
and close the case as soon as possible.

406
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,020
I want to solve these disputes.

407
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:42,860
I don't want to see anybody

408
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:44,230
die in front of me again.

409
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:48,970
Good evening, Lord Liu.

410
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,920
Since you know who I am,

411
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:02,350
let's be honest with each other.

412
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:03,540
Don't beat around the bush.

413
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:05,900
Good.

414
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:07,140
In that case,

415
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:09,330
do you admit to committing the crime?

416
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,190
I didn't report the information.

417
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:13,980
According to the law, I will be caned 30 times.

418
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,840
So it was indeed you

419
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
who followed me yesterday.

420
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,130
Do you have wine, Mr. Yun?

421
00:28:29,610 --> 00:28:30,560
To be honest,

422
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,460
compared to the bandits of Lingyuan Sect,

423
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,440
I hate those hypocrites of Yuntai Sect more.

424
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,500
I'm all ears.

425
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:49,690
Lingyuan Sect

426
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,580
is just a bunch of bandits.

427
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:53,910
They're calling for the resurgence of orthodoxy.

428
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:55,490
In fact, it's for power.

429
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,410
It's for the position above all people.

430
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,110
It's the same with Yuntai Sect,

431
00:29:02,170 --> 00:29:03,720
but they pretend to be sanctimonious.

432
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,910
They retreated and hid away from the city.

433
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,360
How pathetic.

434
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:13,150
If they are talented, why won't they work as officials?

435
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:16,670
To serve the people in the rightful way.

436
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:22,380
You can't cross a river without being covered in mud.

437
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,050
Yuntai's people are used to maintaining their integrity.

438
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:33,370
The officialdom is full of uncertainties.

439
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,760
A mix of good and evil.

440
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,850
But it is the officialdom.

441
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,220
Humans are hard to predict. Both good and bad exist.

442
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,820
The only thing we can rely on is the law.

443
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,210
I hate Yuntai

444
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,400
because they claim to be superior.

445
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,980
How could they be above the law

446
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,070
because of maintaining the integrity?

447
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,370
What do you think, Mr. Yun?

448
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,620
The world is so complicated.

449
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,160
Who is cleaner than who?

450
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:08,140
I'm talking to you about Yuntai Sect.

451
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:11,860
Yuntai's people are also people of the world.

452
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:12,830
Wrong.

453
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,320
No matter if you are in the officialdom or not,

454
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,030
there will be a river in front of you.

455
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,920
You must cross it to survive.

456
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,970
If you managed to cross it,

457
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:23,760
you might be covered in mud.

458
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,240
If you know you're covered in mud,

459
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,340
you're at least honest.

460
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:34,060
If you still pretend to be pure and innocent,

461
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:37,250
that would be really dirty.

462
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:47,740
Yuntai Sect.

463
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,710
It's dirty.

464
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,940
If you have something to say, say it now.

465
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,180
Otherwise, you won't have a chance

466
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,810
in the government dungeon.

467
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:12,700
To be honest,

468
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:15,930
even if Lord Liu didn't come tonight,

469
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:20,350
I would have visited you tomorrow morning.

470
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:23,970
Nothing else.

471
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:27,750
I just want to make a deal with you.

472
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:32,760
A deal between Yuntai and imperial guards.

473
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,620
It's a deal between Lord Liu and me.

474
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,190
I'm willing to do my best to help you

475
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:43,880
solve the water ghost robbery case.

476
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:48,300
Indeed.

477
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:52,360
With the ability of the best Detective of Jiangnan.

478
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,250
it's not difficult to catch

479
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,300
some fleeing towboat soldiers.

480
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,360
But if you leave it to me,

481
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:03,340
I will get it done within three days.

482
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,400
And my offer is simple.

483
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:09,240
I just need to be exempted from the 30 canes.

484
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,020
In that case,

485
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:15,620
you'd better follow me to the government office.

486
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,160
Don't force me to arrest you.

487
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,020
You think this is an insignificant deal.

488
00:32:30,980 --> 00:32:32,060
If you make a deal with strangers,

489
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:34,490
we have to start small.

490
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,860
We need to gain trust

491
00:32:39,670 --> 00:32:40,630
and strengthen our relationship.

492
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:46,700
Then there will be big business.

493
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:05,090
You're very eloquent.

494
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,400
Yun Xiang, the crime you committed

495
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,420
is more than not reporting the information.

496
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,300
After you entered the city,

497
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:23,190
you caused constant chaos in the business world.

498
00:33:23,570 --> 00:33:26,370
You also colluded with Mo Bufan from Guanghui Bank.

499
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,830
You're suspected of colluding with the pirates.

500
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,880
All of them.

501
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:33,610
Every one of them is a capital crime.

502
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,850
All the land belongs to the emperor.

503
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,870
Our imperial guards are the eyes of the emperor.

504
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:55,050
Do you really think you can hide

505
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,460
what you did from the world?

506
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,250
Since you came into the city,

507
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:04,900
you didn't try your best to arrest the robbers.

508
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:08,020
Instead, you kept an eye on me.

509
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:10,800
At first, I thought

510
00:34:12,489 --> 00:34:15,060
you wanted to use me to lead the way

511
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:17,030
and take advantage of it.

512
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,449
Compared to arresting the bandits of Lingyuan Sect,

513
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,489
I'm more curious

514
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:25,040
why you are always against them.

515
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:28,679
Since you can go against them,

516
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,340
you should have greater leverage.

517
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,429
So you're sure

518
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,040
you can find more clues

519
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:38,780
about Lingyuan from me.

520
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:43,780
To this point, I should be honest with you.

521
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:48,760
I can let you go for now.

522
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,290
But you and I

523
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:55,620
should make a real value deal.

524
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,620
Did you catch them alive

525
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,810
when you suddenly attacked the boat?

526
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,160
The bandits of Lingyuan would rather die than surrender.

527
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,780
We only caught a few silversmiths

528
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,790
who were tricked onto the boat.

529
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:28,280
According to Lingyuan's way,

530
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,620
it's impossible for the silversmiths to know the truth.

531
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,520
So there is no way to prove it.

532
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,360
But do you suspect

533
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,570
that this water ghost robbery case

534
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:40,650
could be fabricated into a mystery?

535
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,190
The robbers have secretly shipped

536
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:44,220
official ingots back to the inner lake of Nandu.

537
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,420
As long as the money sank,

538
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,080
the case would be closed.

539
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,900
But they chose to melt silver and sell the stolen goods.

540
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,170
That's why they left a loophole.

541
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,970
Maybe it wasn't because of money.

542
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,650
What if they did it intentionally?

543
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:01,120
Go on.

544
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,770
Recently, strange things have happened in Nandu.

545
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:07,800
Everything is related to Lingyuan Sect.

546
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,030
The connection is quite subtle.

547
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,360
For example,

548
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,630
why don't you and I start

549
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,920
investigating those fleeing soldiers?

550
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:19,180
I will explain everything to you during this time.

551
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:22,890
My Lord.

552
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,870
You are an official and I am a civilian.

553
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,330
Even if the deal is over,

554
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,970
and you want to target me,

555
00:36:31,210 --> 00:36:32,550
I can only surrender.

556
00:36:32,970 --> 00:36:34,150
I can't escape even if I have wings.

557
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:35,460
That means

558
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,470
you're sure that this deal

559
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,540
will change my view towards Yuntai?

560
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,180
I dare not.

561
00:36:41,930 --> 00:36:43,260
This has nothing to do with Yuntai.

562
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,190
It's just a deal between you and me.

563
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:48,740
Since you came here in person

564
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:50,660
to talk to me late at night,

565
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:53,520
I believe you agree with me.

566
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:54,770
In that case,

567
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:57,980
I will not let you down.

568
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:11,900
Girl,

569
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,260
are you going somewhere?

570
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,730
Why do you ask?

571
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,840
You sounded like

572
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,610
you were planning for your afterlife.

573
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:22,910
No, no, no.

574
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:25,380
It seemed like you were saying goodbye to us.

575
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,290
Don't be so sentimental.

576
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:33,110
Did the kids make your heart soft

577
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,590
or did Tianhu make you smart?

578
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,310
No, no.

579
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,100
You and Miss Ke, don't see us like that.

580
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:40,890
You...

581
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,430
You're clearly thinking about it,

582
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:44,340
but you don't allow others to say it.

583
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,460
Didn't you return to Liansheng House for Tianhu?

584
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,260
Was it for Yun Xiang?

585
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,340
Goodbye, sir.

586
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:52,950
No.

587
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,200
I...

588
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:57,700
Girl, you pinched me.

589
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:01,530
-Don't talk to me.
-Uncle, wait for me.

[Liansheng House]

591
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,240
What did you promise me that day?

592
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,550
How could you meet the suspect alone?

593
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,480
You've been working hard lately.

594
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,740
I want to share your burden.

595
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,660
What was the result?

596
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,550
You grew up in a high wall and deep courtyard.

597
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:20,540
Everyone is respectful to you.

598
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:23,280
But there is the martial world outside the walls.

599
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,020
People don't live by the rules you know.

600
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:28,100
Your princess identity couldn't protect you,

601
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,160
and could even put you in more danger.

602
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,230
But as you said,

603
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,910
people in Yuntai are not evil.

604
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,150
-That's why I…
-Do you believe anything I say?

605
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,210
Can't I believe what you've said?

606
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,090
I just hope

607
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,820
Your Highness could be more careful

608
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,410
and protect yourself.

609
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,150
Okay, I got it.

610
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,010
I got it.

611
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,540
Uncle, don't be angry.

612
00:38:59,560 --> 00:38:59,920
My lord,

613
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,500
what should we do with Yun Xiang?

614
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,100
It's hard to tell if he's good or bad. Not an ordinary man.

615
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,180
Just wait.

create turmoil to the world.

619
00:39:13,390 --> 00:39:14,730
I'm going out of the city tomorrow.

620
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:15,790
Li Bo will be with you.

621
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,910
Just take a rest in the villa.

622
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:24,990
Judging from your look,

623
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:27,040
your enemy is here.

624
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,270
It would be easier if they were enemies.

625
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,180
That is Liu Gongquan, the Detective of Jiangnan.
