00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,260
I have nothing else I can welcome you with.

5
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,280
This is the mung bean cake I made this noon.

6
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,340
Have a taste.

7
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:10,789
Thank you.

8
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:30,130
The mung bean cake you made is different from that sold in the shop.

9
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,450
What special ingredient did you use?

10
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,040
Nothing special. Just the usual ingredients.

11
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,650
You have to take care of so many children.

12
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,430
Yet you had time to make mung cake at noon?

13
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,980
I have a knack for time management.

14
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:47,780
In the past two years,

15
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,250
how much money has Jishan Hall received?

16
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,780
I don't know the total number.

17
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,630
But every amount of money

18
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,870
is clearly recorded.

19
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,490
You've just checked the books.

20
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,820
Three months ago,

21
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,040
Jin alone sent 60 taels of silver.

22
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,850
Considering current prices, this amount of money

23
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,350
can cover one year's expenditure of an average family.

24
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,100
But you used all that money in one month.

25
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,730
The money that Jin risked his life to earn

26
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,020
was entrusted to the wrong person.

27
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:26,290
What are the kids?

28
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,380
Why are you hiding like a coward?

29
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,579
Come out and fight with me.

30
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,160
Hand over the kids.

31
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:11,830
Then I might spare your life.

32
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,260
You got paid. You need to do your job.

33
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,810
I've paid you.

34
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,209
Don't come any closer.

37
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,170
You are going to pay for that.

38
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,020
Let me guess,

39
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:23,830
every time a donator found something wrong,

40
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,650
you would take them to the backyard

41
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,580
and kill them, just like what you did to Jin.

42
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:29,570

44
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,550
You must be badly injured.

45
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,620
You are really unlucky today.

46
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,610
Jin is in a bad mood today.

47
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,060

55

It smells so bad.

56
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,410
You can try it yourself.

63
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:55,680
Sold?

64
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,730
Don't be afraid. I'll get you out of here.

65
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:13,990
Turn around.

I'm curious

69
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,460
how you got this poison.

70
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,280
There's no point asking.

71
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:45,580
As the name indicates, the poison will flow in your blood until you die.

72
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:48,010
You'll be so painful that you want to me kill you quickly.

73

A good rider falls off the horseback.

74

A good swimmer drowns in water.

75
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,410
Because they are careless and arrogant.

76
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,480
You didn't touch me just now.

77
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:20,330
Is that so?

00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:43,620
Since you know a lot about Dragon series poison,

81
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:46,390
you know Red Dragon has different effects on different people.

82
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,100
This poison can kill people in thousands of different ways.

83
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:53,600
I think your liver will be melted

84
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,760

To do such business, the buyers are careful.

They will not reveal their names.

94

107
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,410
It's done.

108
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:50,180
Give me your hand.

If it hurts, you can pinch me.

It doesn't hurt.

120

I'm not afraid.

121
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:46,530
According to Mrs. Jia,

122
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,480
people go to Jishan Hall to buy children every month.

123
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,050
Girls are sold to be underage prostitutes,

124
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,170
and boys, servants.

125
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,580
Xiaoyu wasn't sold

126
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,570
probably because she hasn't fully recovered.

127
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,570
But where did those kids go?

128
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,460
I told you not to kill her.

129
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,460
She probably didn't know.

130
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,410
But since people bought kids from Jishan Hall regularly,

131
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,540
there must be a whole chain.

132
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,980
With a number of people involved.

133
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,580
It shouldn't be difficult to find clues.

135
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,220

00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,470
Not yet.

137
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,300

What else do you want?

144
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,860
I'll buy it for you.

157

He said I can sing it when I miss him.

But it turns out that he's very gentle.

180

I didn't think so when we first met.

00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,140
to Cao Sect's headquarters.

190
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,140
Did you find out

191
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,510
who set the fire?

192
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:14,720
We've been investigating.

193
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:15,980
But we don't have a clue.

194
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:18,660
All right, you may leave.

195
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:19,730
Yes.

196
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:21,630
Wait.

197
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,290
The three of your subordinates took an order

198
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,450
to kill Jin Biao without our permission.

199
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,450
Do you know that?

200
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,140
Jin Biao?

201
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,700
The swordsman together with Yun Xiang?

202
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,570
Yes.

203
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,810
Jin Biao is a martial arts ace.

204
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,120
Only one of the three survived.

205
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:36,930
And he's seriously injured.

206
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,370
This is a result of my lax supervision.

207
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,330
It's my fault.

208
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,900
I'll kill him so that no one can find out.

209
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,200
You...

210
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:42,760
Bastard!

211
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,230
Those people are your men.

212
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,170
Just keep an eye on him.

213
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,910
Take care of the funeral of those two.

214
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:03,660
Also,

215
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:06,420
this matter rests here.

216
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,740
Don't mention it again.

217
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:08,980
Yes.

218
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,080
You may leave.

219
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,760
Master, you've tasted at least a hundred kinds of tea.

220
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,030
The tea tree on the hill is still your favorite.

221
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,780
Tell me about the raw silk.

222
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,950
The silk price has risen to five taels per catty.

223
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,830
It's estimated

224
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:32,760
the price will double tomorrow.

225
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,520
We spent 8,000 taels to buy in silk today.

226
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:38,180
But even so,

227
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,970
we still don't have enough inventory.

228
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:45,180
The 15,000 taels sent by Mr. Tang

229
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:46,870
will run out soon.

230
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:49,550
Maybe it will be used up tomorrow.

231
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:50,750
I know it clearly.

232
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:52,940
Master,

233
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:54,900
I've been with you for so many years.

234
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:59,370
You've never done such business.

235
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,540
Someone from Yuntai is coming.

236
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,420
I have no choice.

237
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,450
I have to take the risk.

238
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,300
Ding Yi,

239
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,280
we can't afford to miss this opportunity.

240
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,450
If we can defeat the Su family

241
00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:15,980
and dominate the business world in Nandu,

242
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,020
Yuntai will be warier of us.

243
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,750
The Tang family will also restrain themselves.

244
00:19:23,470 --> 00:19:26,460
But the Su family is illustrious, notable,

245
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,630
and wealthy.

246
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,240
It's not that easy

247
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:30,870
to deal with them.

248
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,140
Just wait.

249
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:36,780
Just like this tea.

250
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:38,980
Drink slowly.

251
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,380
Only after three brews,

252
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,640
can its true flavor be revealed.

253
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,220
The three shadowmen

254
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,920
didn't know

255
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,980
what dirty business Jishan Hall did.

256
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,540
Take this as a lesson

257
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,400
and lay down strict rules.

258
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:57,820
Of course.

259
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,480
But I'm worried that...

260
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,610
According to sect rules, we can't recruit secret soldiers without permission.

261
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,490
And now Master is in Nandu.

262
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,300
Are you worried

263
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:09,690
Yun Xiang will report us to Master?

264
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,780
I don't know.

265
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,600
After all, even you can't see through him.

266
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:18,060
You don't need to see through everyone.

267
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,570
You just need to remember

268
00:20:19,930 --> 00:20:21,610
everyone is profit-orientated.

269
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:24,440
If he turns me in,

270
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,320
what benefits can he get?

271
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:45,980
Why can't the Chamber of Commerce in Nandu

272
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,540
be controlled by Nandu's businessmen?

273
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,750
Why does it have to be Wen Cong?

274
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,330
Uncle Jin, come and get me!

275
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,110
Give it to me.

276
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,130
Come and get me.

277
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,530
Give it to me!

278
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,420
Come and get me.

279
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,300
I'm here!

280
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,650
Come after me!

281
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:08,390
Chase me!

282
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,500
Give me the pinwheel.

283
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,120
Give it to me.

284
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,780
I'm teaching her how to throw darts.

285
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:34,230
Why did you suddenly come out?

286
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,130
She's just a kid. How can you teach her this?

287
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,290
Don't go out. Play in the room.

288
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:48,160
I...

289
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,440
How would I know what to play with kids?

290
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,870
Besides, what's wrong with teaching her this?

291
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:57,420
She can learn to protect herself.

292
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,540
What's wrong with you?

293
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,750
The future of the Su family is hanging by a thread.

294
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,390
Su Mingyu

295
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,960
tackled the government

296
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,780
just for what happened in Jishan Hall.

297
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,500
That "Ten Taels of Gold" is not better.

298
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,940
He has no foundation in Nandu.

299
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:24,910
However, he insisted on

300
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,700
looking for clues single-handedly.

301
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,400
In addition,

302
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,650
ever since I bought Liansheng House,

303
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,810
no one has been taking good care of it.

304
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,520
Xiaoyu gets along well with all of us.

305
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,160
You are the only one she avoids.

306
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:43,830
Have you ever thought about the reason?

307
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,460
We are facing so many dangers now.

308
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,510
How can I enjoy

309
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,440
playing with a kid like you do?

310
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:53,780
Sure enough,

311
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,660
children have sharp eyes.

312
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,740
They can tell who has a warm heart

313
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,660
and who doesn't at a glance.

314
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,150
I don't care

315
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:04,410
how a kid thinks of me.

316
00:23:06,890 --> 00:23:10,150
The price of raw silk will increase to 5 taels per catty today.

317
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,610
Most of the raw silk stocks in the city

318
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,360
has been controlled by Qi Tianfeng.

319
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:16,970
This is a life-or-death moment for the Su family.

320
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:18,950
In such a troubled situation,

321
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,250
it's okay if you don't want to help,

322
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,300
but can you leave me alone?

323
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:32,230
That ring looks ordinary to me,

324
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,640
but you treasure it.

325
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,000
You said those children had nothing to do with you,

326
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,690
but they are precious to "Ten Taels of Gold".

327
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,300
"Ten Taels of Gold" is anxious

328
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,750
because he doesn't know where the kids are

329
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,260
and what they are suffering from.

330
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,380
Mr. Su is trying his best to help.

331
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:49,810
What did they do wrong?

332
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,630
I'm trying to reason with you, but you're talking about love with me.

333
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,980
If there is only reason in the world,

334
00:23:58,090 --> 00:23:59,140
everything will be much simpler,

335
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,920
but it's more boring as well.

336
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,410
I heard people from Yuntai

337
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,030
don't engage in love or hatred.

338
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,550
But if you don't know hatred, how can you love?

339
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:11,850
If you don't know love,

340
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,840
what's the meaning of living?

341
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,610
I don't know why Godfather saved you.

342
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,260
But I'm sure part of that reason is sympathy.

343
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,260
Dad.

344
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,100
Dad!

345
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,750
What's wrong with you, Dad?

346
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:29,930
Dad!

347
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,230
What's wrong with you, Dad?

348
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:36,660
Dad.

349
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:44,130
If you're done, please leave.

350
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,380
I'm not finished.

351
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,700
I don't believe you don't feel sorry for the kids at all.

352
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,410
You've been restless since last night.

353
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:57,040
You watched the iron hook for a long time.

354
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,510
What's the secret behind it?

355
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,150
It's Guanghui Bank.

356
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,780
Why didn't you tell Jin Biao

357
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,600
such an important clue?

358
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,460
You know his personality.

359
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,760
If he knows,

360
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,420
he will definitely storm into Guanghui Bank.

361
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,030
But Kang Qiao and Jin Biao

362
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:42,640
are neck and neck.

363
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,330
If I join hands with him against Kang Qiao,

364
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,730
we might have a chance of winning.

365
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,440
Do I have to arm wrestle you

366
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,160
to remind you of your condition?

367
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,820
Maybe I'm no match for Kang Qiao.

368
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,660
But I can deal with you

369
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,610
even if I'm not doing well.

370
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,060
I underestimated you.

371
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,020
Can't you show me some mercy?

372
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:05,340
Considering how much I don't like you,

373
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,630
that's not an option.

374
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:11,210
Actually, if "Ten Taels of Gold" finds out the truth,

375
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,700
it will give me an advantage.

376
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:17,300
If I tell him the truth now, will you think I'm cruel?

377
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,400
What do you mean?

378
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,350
Maybe Mo Bufan did it on purpose,

379
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,870
or maybe it's a misunderstanding.

380
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,280
Whatever the truth is, he must be waiting for me

381
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,720
to question him.

382
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,340
If I let "Ten Taels of Gold" confront him first,

383
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,140
Mo Bufan will feel in the wrong.

384
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,090
Then it'd be easier to make him at my disposal.

385
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,620
As you said,

386
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,980
you didn't tell Jin for his own good.

387
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:45,660
If you mean what you say,

388
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,880
you still have a conscience.

389
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,400
I just want to wait a little longer.

390
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,290
When everyone is in panic,

391
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,500
the tide will turn in favor of me.

392
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,540
By then, you and Jin

393
00:26:57,780 --> 00:26:59,020
can smash Guanghui Bank.

394
00:26:59,630 --> 00:27:00,880
Then I'll step in to mediate,

395
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,560
forcing Mo Bufan to join my side.

396
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,880
What do you think of my plan?

397
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,300
I touched your hand just now. It felt warm.

398
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,370
I guess it's my illusion.

Have you seen Xiaoyu's injuries?

401

Have you ever thought about

402
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,940
how miserable those missing children would be?

403
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,120

You fought with your senior.

409
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:50,840
That's against sect rules.

410

Is that what all these years of hard cultivation taught you to do?

He took my thing.

412
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:58,550

Every tangible thing dies.

It's just an ornament.

418

It's just I've been wearing it for a long time.

419
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,740
Don't lie to me.

420
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,580
It's the only thing

Destroy it?

424
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:30,850
I won't unless I die.

425
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,380
If you can let go of your obsession,

426
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,820
you'll be at peace with yourself.

427
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,850
It's a taboo for people of Yuntai

428
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,620
to have obsessions or be trapped in emotions.

00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,300
Are you going to disobey my order?

430
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,190
If I expelled you from the sect because of this,

431
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,420
your cultivation for years will be in vain.

432
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,990
Will you regret it?

433
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:51,750
No.

434
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,000
Your worry deflects you from the truth.

00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,930

00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,060
I felt uneasy.

00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:38,100

Young Master,

458
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,850
are you going to sell

00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:39,400
all the raw silk?

460
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,550
Yes, all of it.

This time, all 11 escorted teams

462
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,390
were attacked.

463
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,130
Less than two-tenths of the raw silk got here.

464
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,810
The raw silk we have now

465
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:55,790
is not enough

466
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,900
for our own production.

467
00:31:59,210 --> 00:31:59,790
Qian,

468
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:01,950
I have my reasons.

469
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,300
How about this?

470
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,760
We should let your sister decide.

471
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,110
Although we don't have much raw silk,

472
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,700
it's enough to make tribute cloth.

473
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,660
That can also

474
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,940
solve our urgent problem.

475
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:17,770
Qian, the tribute cloth

476
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:19,890
isn't our most urgent problem now.

477
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:20,900
Our priority is to maintain our status

478
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,280

00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:26,910
Sister, are we still in touch with

00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,810
Eunuch Liu of the Textile Department?

481
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,180
That's great.

482
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,380
Eunuch Liu

483
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,480
has always been very close to us.

484
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,060
If he can help us,

485
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:39,370
we can deliver

486
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,370
the tribute cloth later.

487
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,860
Eunuch Liu can help us with the tribute cloth

488
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,670
but he can't control the silk market in Nandu.

489
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,300
There are many people in the Nandu business world

490
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:50,720
coveting the position of chairman.

491
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,380
If we can't lower the silk price

492
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:54,850
and fail to stabilize the silk market,

493
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,970
sister, you are to blame.

494
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:02,370
Then, you'll lose the position of chairman

495
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:03,990
and the Su family's reputation will be greatly damaged.

00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:07,500
Could we still be a royal supplier by then?

497
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:11,420
Sister, Qian,

498
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,090
you should know

499
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,280
what you are doing

500
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,580
and prioritize the problems we are facing.

501
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,020
Let me ask you.

502
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,220
How can we lower the silk price

503
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,960
with just more than ten carts of raw silk?

504
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:26,540
Well...

505
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,340
This...

506
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:35,500
Your sister will ask

507
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,160
how to use this small amount of raw silk

508
00:33:37,710 --> 00:33:38,910
to lower the silk price.

509
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:40,140
Then your answer should be

510
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,790
in the name of the Chamber of Commerce...

511
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:42,800
Yes.

512
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,100
We can sell raw silk at a low price

513
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,780
in the name of the Chamber of Commerce.

514
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:48,030
In this way,

515
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,370
we can stop the price of raw silk from rising.

516
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,040
Also, people can see

517
00:33:52,370 --> 00:33:54,450
you have

518
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,470
a strong sense of responsibility.

519
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,540
Anyway, making tribute cloth

520
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,410
is an effectual...

521
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,460
No.

522
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,430
Making tribute cloth is an ineffectual remedy.

523
00:34:03,890 --> 00:34:06,080
To reduce silk prices is to move the needle.

524
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:12,810
What's wrong?

525
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,500
Sister,

526
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:24,250

You're already deeply in love.

00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:28,929
How can you hide it?

529
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:30,900
Life is short.

530
00:34:31,429 --> 00:34:32,850
Time flies by.

531
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:35,020
You don't have to hide it.

532
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,699
Besides, there are only you and me in the Su family.

533
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,790
I consider Qian as a family member.

534
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,420

536
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,320
Sister.

537
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,020
Does it matter?

538
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:57,040
Do you think it makes sense too?

539
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,240

00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,880
Okay, I'll do it now.

546
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:25,460
Why don't you talk with me

00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,350
about Miss Ke?

548
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,530

A masterpiece dating back to the Southern Tang.

551
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,100
I didn't expect it to be in the Su family.

552
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:31,970
Some people think the story behind the painting is like this.

553
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,080
When the Southern Tang was in decline,

554
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:40,160
Emperor Li Yun ordered the imperial painter to sneak into Han Xizai's house.

555
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:42,120
He wanted to see

556
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,500
if the man he intended to appoint as Prime Minister

557
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,400

558

00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,650
as rumors said.

560
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,860
The painter's skills were excellent.

561
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,310
The painter portrayed the banquet vividly.

562
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,720
The emperor must have seen

563
00:36:59,330 --> 00:37:01,800
Han Xizai indeed led a life of debauchery

564
00:37:02,770 --> 00:37:03,640
and he was not an aspiring man.

565
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,440
Thus, the emperor didn't make Han Xizai an official.

566
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:11,460
But if you look carefully,

567
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,420
you can see that Han Xizai sat there alone

568
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,000
when others were singing and dancing.

569
00:37:16,330 --> 00:37:17,540
He was frowning.

570
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:20,580
Maybe the emperor saw

571
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,940
how hedonistic Han Xizai was.

572
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:26,340
Or, he actually understood Han Xizai's true purpose but didn't point it out.

573
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,320
What do you think?

574
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,310
I think this person is quite interesting.

575
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:39,100
Han Xizai was sitting by himself at this boisterous banquet.

576
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,970
He was the only one with a sober mind.

577
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:46,310
Then this monk seems to have entered the secular world by mistake.

578
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,450
He and Han Xizai were best friends.

579
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,010
He knew Han Xizai was ambitious

580
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:51,880
but Han couldn't realize his aspirations.

581
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,160
Therefore, Han Xizai could only indulge in wine

582
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:55,720
for the rest of his life.

583
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:00,160
The sigh of the monk could be heard clearly

584
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:01,770
even after hundreds of years.

585
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,220
The person with the most acute observation

586
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:07,520
should be the imperial painter.

587
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:09,940
It's not difficult to draw people's posture.

588
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,820
But he understood what was behind the posture.

589
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,410
No matter how brilliant the painter was,

590
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,450
he wouldn't know that after dynasties,

591
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,030
someone would

592
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,460
examine his work so carefully.

593
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,210
In this chaotic world, it's difficult to see things clearly.

594
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:34,360
In fact, you already knew

595
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,860
this isn't Gu Hongzhong's original work.

596
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,310
But you didn't point it out.

597
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,370
The world is chaotic.

598
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,310
Why bother to distinguish the true

599
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,620
from the false?

600
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:47,780
Just like this painting.

601
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,450
It may not be useful.

602
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,230
It's silent

603
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:55,420
but it's far better than the noise outside.

604
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,130
Mr. Yun,

605
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:59,910
unlike Han Xizai,

606
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,940
the Su family has many friends

607
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:04,110
and we are exactly what we appear to be.

608
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,770
We treat our friends

609
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:10,210
sincerely.

610
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:14,100
Since I'm here,

611
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,740
I know it clearly.

612
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:28,460
[High Quality Raw Silk, 2 Taels per Catty]

613
00:39:22,850 --> 00:39:23,230
Everybody,

614
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,030
the raw silk for today is sold out.

615
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:26,730
I'm really sorry.

616
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:27,970
Sold out?

617
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:29,530
Do you have more tomorrow?

618
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,120
Everyone,

619
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:31,630
recently the price of raw silk in Nandu

620
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,380
has soared to 6 taels per catty.

621
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:35,900
Six taels!

622
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,020
So if you want to buy

623
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,620
cheap raw silk,

624
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,100
why don't you come in

625
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,050
to learn what the Su family's plan is?

626
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:44,650
Okay?

627
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:45,800
Okay.

628
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:46,310
Let's go.

629
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,030
Thank you for coming.

630
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,500
I'm truly grateful.

631
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:52,480
Mr. Su,

632
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,140
we are here today for raw silk.

633
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:56,500
Yes.

634
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,000
Business is business.

635
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,950
Just tell us how much raw silk you have

636
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,270
and what's the price.

637
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:03,210
To be honest,

638
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:06,980
the Su family's silk is already sold out.

639
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,350
Sold out?

640
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:10,580
Why are we here then?

641
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,350
Let's go.

642
00:40:11,870 --> 00:40:12,270
Let's go.

643
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,140
Let's go.

644
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:13,860
Let's go.

645
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:14,720
Let's go.

646
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,700
Please wait.

647
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,100
Although we have no more inventory,

648
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:23,430
we'll keep selling the raw silk of the Chamber of Commerce

649
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:26,160
at the price of two taels per catty.

650
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:28,010
What does this mean?

651
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,420
He doesn't have any raw silk but he'll keep selling at the price of two taels per catty?

652
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,190
Let's listen to his explanation.

653
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,630
What's going on?

654
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:39,710
Everyone,

655
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,240
this is the deed endorsed by the Chamber of Commerce,

656
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,860
stipulating that the Su family

657
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,690
will sell its raw silk at 2 taels per catty.

658
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,980
There are 80,000 catties in total.

659
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,170
We'll deliver the order in 15 days.

660
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:54,410
Of course,

661
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,230
if we can't deliver it in 15 days,

662
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,760
we'll make compensation according to the silk price on that day.

663
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,470
[Deed]

664
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,470
[Two taels per catty. 80,000 catties in total. Promise to deliver in 15 days.]

665
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,470
[Nandu Chamber of Commerce]

666
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,710
It's clearly written behind the deed.
