What brings you here

7
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,350
in the morning?

8
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:24,350
We found the towboat's official soldiers.

9
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:27,770
Where are they now?

10
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:33,750
I heard that Tang's Gambling House had been reopened.

11
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,800
Can you leave it to me?

12
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,780
You're so drunk right now.

13
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:39,950
How can I trust you?

14
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,170
Greetings, Your Highness.

15
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,970
Although you're drunk,

16
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,980
it's much more pleasing to the eye than your scary countenance yesterday.

17
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,970
You'd better tell us where the soldiers are.

18
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,860
My uncle can't stand others bargaining with him.

19
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,580
Yes.

20
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,400
Lord Liu, to be honest,

21
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,120
the towboat's official soldiers

22
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,540
are at Liyun port in the eastern suburbs.

23
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:09,860
They've all been tied up.

24
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:11,560
You just have to go and finish it up.

25
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,890
You can deal with Tang family's business then.

26
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,240
Thank you, Lord Liu.

27
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,170
He's moody and drinks too much.

28
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,470
According to rumors, the people of Yuntai Sect shouldn't be like this.

29
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,120
Your Highness...

30
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,040
So, they took such great pains and made such a huge detour

31
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,360
with the silver robbery case...

32
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,640
all just for Tang family's business.

33
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,890
You're good at navigating through all the clues.

34
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,190
You're reading too much into it.

35
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:49,580
He's just playing by ear

36
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,890
and adapting to the circumstances.

37
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,570
He's just good at acting according to the situation.

38
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,450
Mr. Mo, you're wrong.

39
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,340
I bet Yun already had a plan in mind

40
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,640
before gambling with Tang Xiao.

41
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,040
Only this way of making repeated strikes,

42
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,470
coupled with the power of the government,

43
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,960
would we have reached today's outcome.

44
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:06,870
Stop talking.

45
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,560
Aren't you afraid he'll be more daring the next time?

46
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,650
Anyway, Tang Xiao's biggest mistake

47
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,750
was to go against Yun.

48
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,980
It's his fault for having connections with the Lingyuan Sect.

49
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,720
But forget it. It's all in the past.

50
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,870
What matters now

51
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,020
is for you to come up with a set of statements.

52
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,740
Tactful statements.

53
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,220
After all, Tang Xiao is a member of the Chamber of Commerce.

54
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,370
As the chairman,

55
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:40,030
you and Mr. Mo openly

56
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,490
devouring Tang's business together

57
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,500
would likely attract criticism.

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,500
Try the new lotus tea I made.

59
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,610
I melted winter gourd sugar into it.

60
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:54,620
It's delicious.

61
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,990
It's sweet but not cloyingly so, and smooth but not dry.

62
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:58,810
The two of you should have a taste.

63
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:00,990
I have my own drink.

64
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,120
How could he be in the mood to drink your tea?

65
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,260
Here, I'll have it.

66
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,200
Thank you, Miss Ke.

67
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,780
Have you come up with a plan

68
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,240
for what the two of them had just suggested?

69
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,640
Don't worry about that.

70
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,750
I'm sure the two of them already have a perfect plan in their minds.

71
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:19,880
You and Mr. Mo just need to

72
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,930
act according to my script.

73
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,460
It's delicious. It's sweet.

74
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,690
Cloyingly sweet.

75
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,310
Uncle.

76
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,440
How many people are there in one unit of the Cao Army?

77
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,280
32. They're all here.

78
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,960
Does that mean the case is closed?

79
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,440
You just woke up?

80
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:07,260
Since you've heard of my name before,

81
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,990
just tell me the truth.

82
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,070
Then, I might find a way for you to get out alive.

83
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,460
Lord Liu, what do you want to know?

84
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,560
The whole truth about the day of the incident.

85
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,390
That day, it was around midnight

86
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,790
when there was suddenly a huge cloud of fog above the river.

87
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,780
A vast, white cloud.

88
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,290
I only found out later

89
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,900
that it was poison and not fog.

90
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:40,530
Several buddies on the boat in front of us collapsed one after another.

91
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,450
When we woke up,

92
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,560
the official silver was already gone.

93
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,120
We didn't dare to go back and report about what had happened,

94
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,210
so we surrendered to the pirates with the tributary cloth.

95
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,070
But unexpectedly, they betrayed us

96
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,610
after we took a pledge.

97
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,600
Do you still remember the taste of the fog?

98
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:00,010
It was sweet,

99
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,630
with a putrid odor.

100
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,660
What kind of putrid odor?

101
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,310
It seemed like a fishy odor.

102
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,170
Uncle, you know what that is?

103
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,310
It should be the Lingyuan Sect's Dragon Scale Fragrance.

104
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,580
This misty smoke across the river...

105
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,150
What a masterstroke.

107
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,360
Dear members of the Chamber of Commerce,

108
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,640
I think

109
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,640
you've all recently heard about

110
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,510
how Tang's Gambling House is embroiled in controversy.

111
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:41,120
And because of that, Tang Xiao's whereabouts are unknown.

112
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:45,090
His property has also been seized by the government.

113
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,120
The Tang family has dozens of gambling houses.

114
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,730
If we don't have any money to support them after they reopen,

115
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm afraid they'll become defunct.

116
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,220
With timeliness,

117
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,050
over the past few days, Mr. Mo has repeatedly proposed

118
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,950
that he'd like to take over the business.

119
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:01,870
Everyone,

120
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,440
I think you all know

121
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,390
that Guanghui Bank had just ended a lawsuit,

122
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,690
so we don’t have enough cash.

123
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:10,540
I'm here today to discuss with everyone.

124
00:09:10,610 --> 00:09:11,730
Is anyone willing to invest

125
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,950
and join me in taking over the Tang family's business together?

126
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,580
We can't do this.

127
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,250
That's right. It's a bad bargain.

128
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:23,540
If nobody is willing to take the risk,

129
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,780
that's fine too. You can lend me the money

130
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,520
and just collect the interest in peace.

131
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:29,950
Tang Xiao was embroiled in the silver robbery case

132
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,990
and all of his property was seized by the government.

133
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:34,040
It's still uncertain when his business

134
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,290
would reopen.

135
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,430

138
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:41,770

Mr. Mo.

141
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:49,640
There's something I'm unclear about

142
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,290
that I'd like to consult with you in person.

143
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:53,670
Dare I ask

144
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,300
if there's any room for maneuver

145
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,110
with regards to the government's seizure of Tang's property?

146
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,040
As I said,

147
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,450
you're just lending money to me.

148
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,960
As for the current status of the Tang family's business,

149
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:08,580
you don't have to worry about it.

150
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,020
It makes no difference to the Nandu Government Office

151
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,230
whether this business is titled after the Tang or Mo surname.

152
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,040
But for us,

153
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,020
if the business can't be reopened,

154
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,890
not only will we not get any profit,

155
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:26,100
but we're afraid we won't even be able to get back our capital.

156
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,000
Am I right?

157
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,940
That's right.

158
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,030
Mr. Yun.

159
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,680
You know what they're talking about.

160
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,420
Don't be anxious.

161
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,550
Let's keep listening.

162
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,700
Since ancient times, people don't compete with officials for profit.

163
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,560
Mr. Mo, please don't blame us for being too cautious.

164
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,060
How about this?

165
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,240
As a fellow member of the Chamber of Commerce,

166
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,850
I'll donate 100 taels.

167

How about donating a few taels?

176
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,940
Yes, yes.

177
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,050
I'll donate 60 taels,

178
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,070
Mr. Mo.

179
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,180
I'm sincerely seeking benefits for you,

180
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,500
but no one believes me.

181
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,510
Don't say that, Mr. Mo.

182
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,600
Although they aren't many,

183
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,680
aren't they still real silver certificates?

184
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:41,160
Mr. Mo.

185
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,170
Look at this...

186
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:48,670
To be honest,

187
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,240
I'm also really fond of this business.

188
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,980
But as the chairman,

189
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:59,950
if I join hastily, it'll seem like I'm abusing my power for personal gains

190
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,940
and monopolizing the business.

191
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,210
Don’t worry, Chairman Su.

192
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,150
Even if the Su family offers to buy the business,

193
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:06,580
it’s to clean up

194
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:07,980
the mess Tang Xiao left behind.

195
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,020
This is a righteous act.

196
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,810
How could we misunderstand?

197
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:13,090
That's right.

198
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,450
Chairman Su.

199
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,160
You're willing to bear the responsibility of taking over the Tang's Gambling House.

200
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:28,180
You're really brave.

201
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:29,640
Yes.

202
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,990
You're like your sister now with this commanding demeanor.

203
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:33,710
It's a done deal.

204
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:35,650
In the future, as the chairman, I

205
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:37,850
will still need the support of everyone.

206
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:40,730
Of course.

207
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,150
See you.

208
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:41,930
-See you.
-I won't see you off.

209
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,670
See you.

210
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,540
See you.

211
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:49,860
Mr. Mo.

212
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:53,820
Look at how vivid their speeches are.

213
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,950
But deep down, they think I'm a fool.

214
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:01,180
This time, you've expanded your family property

215
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,440
and won the public's praise.

216
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,910
You've killed two birds with one stone.

217
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,710
They won't realize it later

218
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,320
and blame me for cheating, right?

219
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:16,030
They should commend you for hiding your ingenuity in clumsiness.

220
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,800
As the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce,

221
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,910
not only do you want them to respect you,

222
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:22,830
but also to fear you.

223
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,990
Your position in the business world is getting more and more stable.

224
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,590
I think it's time to send a letter to your sister

225
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,520
so that she can rest assured

226
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:32,920
and have fun on her travels.

227
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,100
Thank you for your guidance, Yun.

228
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,900
I think running a business requires

229
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,340
sophistication

230
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,500
and a kind heart.

231
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,140
You've imparted

232
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:45,770
the sophistication to me,

233
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:47,920
but I'll have to thank Menglan

234
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,970
for my kind heart.

235
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,010
You...

236
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,330
only know some simple methods.

237
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,460
You're still so kind and innocent.

238
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:02,530
You haven't changed.

239
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,710
You're the one that knows me best.

240
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,830
Enough.

241
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,410
Stop provoking that silly boy

242
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,180
with your intimacy.

243
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,400
I'll still have to trouble you with all the procedures.

244
00:14:15,710 --> 00:14:17,300
I'll take the silly boy for a walk.

245
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,020
I didn't expect

246
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,690
your plan to take control of the Tang family's business would really succeed.

247
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,320
Tell me.

248
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,100
Was my punishment

249
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,440
also part of your plan?

250
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:34,330
Mr. Mo.

251
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,810
I really have a headache today.

252
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,140
Why don't I go back first?

253
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,240
No need.

254
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,700
There's a teahouse ahead.

255
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,220
How about a cup of hot tea to relieve your headache?

256
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,560
What tea?

257
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,660
If you want a drink, let's drink wine.

258
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,900
Treat me to some wine to get over my hangover.

259
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,220
How about this?

260
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,840
Why don't you go back and rest?

261
00:14:49,570 --> 00:14:49,980
Great.

262
00:14:51,450 --> 00:14:52,480
Stop acting.

263
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:53,980
Why do I feel like

264
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,620
you're using emotional trauma to take personal revenge?

265
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,210
Tell me.

266
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,780
Are you going to look for Liu Gongquan?

267
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,400
Why would I?

268
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:02,810
That shrew of the Lingyuan Sect is in his hands.

269
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,160
Aren't you going to look for clues?

270
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,450
I told you

271
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,380
I'll help you to the end.

272
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,420
But right now,

273
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,230
I do have something more important to tell you.

274
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,470
About our sect?

275
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:22,060
Kid, you're becoming more and more extreme with how you deal with matters.

276
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,200
If it weren't for me

277
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,340
protecting you until now,

278
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,620
I don't know what might have become of you.

279
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,560
When Master left Nandu,

280
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,240
he strictly ordered me to report your every move.

281
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,130
Of course,

282
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,140
I've not provided any updates on all matters regarding you.

283
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,870
I just emphasized that

284
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,460
the Lingyuan Sect has repeatedly intervened in the Nandu Chamber of Commerce.

285
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:44,830
Then, what did Master say?

286
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,890
Since I've reported this,

287
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,820
I have yet to receive a reply.

288
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,480
Do you think he already knew?

289
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:03,800
I've thought about it for a long time.

290
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,100
Today, I'll tell you more about things that are taboo.

291
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,700
You just have to listen.

292
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,740
Imagine when the Yuntai Sect first appeared.

293
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,270
The reigning sovereign regarded the Yuntai Sect as a big threat

294
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,700
and continually tried to kill off everyone in the Sect.

295
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:18,770
But at that time,

296
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,220
the previous sect leaders

297
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,350
didn't hide their true identity from the people around them.

298
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,420
Hiding one's identity is no big deal.

299
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,330
It doesn't break the rules of the sect.

300
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,040
Stop feigning ignorance.

301
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,000
Think about it.

302
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,560
The tension between the current court and the Yuntai Sect

303
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,540
has long cooled down.

304
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,930
But why has our Master

305
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,430
become more and more secretive?

306
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,720
What if the Lingyuan Sect didn't steal our skills secretly

307
00:16:55,190 --> 00:16:57,580
but that someone from our sect is imparting the skills to them,

308
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:01,620
to deliberately blur the boundaries between the two sects?

309
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,740
Do you mean to say that

310
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,920
the person who wants to blur the boundaries

311
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,440
is our Master?

312
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,210
I dare not be so sure.

313
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,660
I'm just considering it.

314
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:24,260
They say God is watching us all the time.

315
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,089
What if someone did something

316
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:28,130
and God couldn't see it?

317
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,140
If a person is hiding in secret

318
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:34,090
without supervision,

319
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,620
he'll become even more reckless in his actions

320
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,470
and his desires will be hard to restrain.

321
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:43,780
Your words

322
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,830
remind me of what Liu Gongquan once said.

323
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,720
As an individual, people may be good or evil,

324
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:51,960
but when they gather together,

325
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,100
good and evil will inevitably be mixed together.

326
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:57,360
We can only rely on the law.

327
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,220
He hates our Yuntai Sect the most,

328
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,390
because our people

329
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,210
have always been outside of the law,

330
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,790
claim self-righteousness,

331
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,410
and consider ourselves flawless.

332
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:09,950
Forget it.

333
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,630
It's all speculation.

334
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,740
Who can discern the truth?

335
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,060
If it's true,

336
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,830
what should we do?

337
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,210
Do we go with the flow like this river,

338
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,740
or eventually return to the nest

339
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,710
like this pigeon?

340
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,910
Send this money to the Xishan branch.

341
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,170
Yes.

342
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:08,790
Greetings, Madam Kou.

343
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:14,040
There's no one here.

344
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,530
Why are you so courteous and rule-abiding?

345
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,020
It's strange.

346
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:20,900
You're reading?

347
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:22,570
You think I'm useless,

348
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,330
[Guiguzi]

349
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,300
so I'm turning over a new leaf.

350
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,630
These are strategies.

351
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,060
They can't be learned in a short time.

352
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,450
If you want to be successful,

353
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,670
learn to control your temper first.

354
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,830
Mother, you sure can tolerate anything.

355
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:39,320
But if I tone down my temper any more,

356
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,650
I'm afraid it won't just be Nangong Fang

357
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:43,050
who'd dare to double-cross our Kou family.

358
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:44,510
Yuanjie—

359
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,100
What? Can't I say it?

360
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:48,350
That outsider Nangong Fang encroached upon half of the Kou family's territory,

361
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,380
and you just stood by and did nothing.

362
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,820
Yet you're always wary of your own son.

363
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,910
You even sent Sister to be by Nangong Fang's side.

364
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,060
Do you want to inherit the position of Sect Master?

365
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:04,930
Fine.

366
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,140
As long as you can get close to me,

367
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:12,730
I will give up my position to you.

368
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,780
You're mentally unstable and distracted.

369
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,960
No matter how quick your moves are,

370
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,920
they're still just illusory.

371
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,100
Do you know that

372
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,450
your sister endured humiliation for the Kou family?

373
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:10,810
And you?

374
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:13,090
I've put so much effort in you.

375
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,220
If I'd put that effort in your sister,

376
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,700
she would be much stronger than you.

377
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,090
Thank you for your teachings, Mother.

378
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,060
Follow me.

379
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:28,020
Wait.

380
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,710
Send the money to the Xishan branch yourself.

381
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:36,110
From now on,

382
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:38,200
focus on completing the tasks I've ordered you to do.

383
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,860
Even if these things are insignificant,

384
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,360
once you've sharpened your character,

385
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,870
I'll return the Young Master seal to you.

386
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,250
Yes, Mother.

387
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,090
Go.

388
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,410
Keep an eye on Young Master.

389
00:21:58,840 --> 00:21:59,990
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

390
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:00,910
Yes.

391
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,500
Madam Kou has always been strict.

392
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:16,860
Don't take it to heart.

393
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,460
I've been by Madam Kou's side all these years.

394
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,720
I know you're the one she values the most.

395
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:26,810
If she really thinks highly of me,

396
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,640
why would she let me be humiliated

397
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:30,610
in front of Nangong Fang?

398
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,810
Madam Kou did it for the big picture.

399
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:34,830
The big picture?

400
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,950
Over the past century, the Lingyuan Sect has always been decisive.

401
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,180
When she took charge, everything had to be done with caution.

402
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,350
I went to Nandu alone

403
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,810
and killed Ye Xiao off with ease,

404
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,350
removing Nangong Fang's right-hand man.

405
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,440
But she doesn't acknowledge it at all.

406
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,110
Kou Lianyi has been outside for years, and what did she accomplish

407
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,220
to be able to win her recognition?

408
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,360
If I remember correctly,

409
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,000
you've been with Madam Kou for more than 10 years.

410
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,750
It's been 17 years.

411
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:03,100
In that case,

412
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,110
you must have witnessed the time

413
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,470
when Nangong Fang first came to offer his services.

414
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:11,010
I heard that his pledge

415
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:14,140
was to crush the power of the Yuntai Sect faction occupying Nandu,

416
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,590
that was to defeat Wen Cong.

417
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:16,960
That's right.

418
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,710
At that time, Madam Kou thought he was just talking through his hat,

419
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,600
but unexpectedly, he got it done.

420
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:23,620
Young Master.

421
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,260
Why are you suddenly mentioning

422
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,640
these matters of the past?

423
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,300
Nothing.

424
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,130
I just suddenly feel that

425
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,520
I haven't accompanied Mother enough for the past few years.

426
00:23:33,810 --> 00:23:34,720
I'm her son

427
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,220
but I'm nowhere near as considerate as a personal guard like you.

428
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:38,710
Young Master, you...

429
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,850
It's getting late. Let's go.

430
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,540
Madam Kou is also good to us.

431
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:51,530
It's just an exchange of kind hearts.

432
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:54,720
After all, blood is thicker than water—

433
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,220
An exchange of kind hearts?

434
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:23,880
Then let Mother feel this pain too.

435
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,180
I didn't expect that traveling for years

436
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,870
has resulted in you becoming more valiant than before.

437
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:45,550
Now, you're even more charming.

438
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,850
Mr. Nangong, you're generous with your praise.

439
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,930
Are you still thinking about the engagement before?

440
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:52,740
I dare not.

441
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,860
I'm just expressing how I feel.

442
00:24:55,710 --> 00:24:57,930
Looking back, I was young and energetic

443
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,740
and didn't know my place,

444
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,270
and dared to desire to be your partner.

445
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,440
It's ridiculous thinking about it now.

446
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,120
Now that we're going to work together,

447
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:08,810
we might as well make things clear

448
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,990
lest there be any concerns about each other.

449
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:13,010
Don't worry.

450
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,050
Although I'm not talented,

451
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,410
I have one positive quality,

452
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,250
which is that I don't dwell on the past

453
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,100
and only look forward to the future.

454
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:24,430
That's great.

455
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:28,190
Mr. Nangong, what do you have planned

456
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,200
for personally visiting Nandu this time?

457
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,570
Four words-

458
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,080
royal supplier of silk.

459
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,890
You want to deal with the Su family?

460
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,830
Not only do I want to deal with the Su family,

461
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,420
but also Mo Bufan and his Guanghui Bank.

462
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:42,300
Of course.

463
00:25:43,790 --> 00:25:45,870
There's one more that I don't have to mention

464
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,070
because you should be well aware of who that is.

465
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,900
If you were in Yangzhou,

466
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,300
you would surely be able to do anything you want.

467
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:55,870
But in the current Nandu,

468
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:58,060
the Yuntai Sect and the Su family have each other's back.

469
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,170
It won't be easy to take them down.

470
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:04,800
Unless... you've already laid out your plan?

471
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:08,920
Yes...

472
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,940
and no.

473
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,330

Mr. Yun.

You're still not sober?

478
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:14,170
The water ghost robbery case has been closed.

479
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,070
The truth of this robbery is worthless to you.

480

481
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,310
have been completed.

482
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,360
Let's talk about the third one now.

483
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,320
Since this case has been concluded,

484
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,210
I'm no longer

485
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,260
of value to you.

486
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,020
Why are you still willing

487
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,650
to proceed with the third deal with me?

488
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,390
Be straightforward and tell me what you want.

489
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,860
Don't push your luck by testing me.

490
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:59,340
I'm afraid you're confused.

As a member of the Yuntai Sect,

494
00:28:07,190 --> 00:28:08,630
even if I had to borrow the government's power,

495
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:10,730
I'd want to deal with the Lingyuan Sect.

496
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,020
It really goes against common sense.

497
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:14,480
You're right.

498
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,920
That's why I want to clarify

It must not have been easy to investigate it

511
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,950
Although I've heard the entire story of this unsettled case,

512
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,940
I've never once imagined that

513
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,020
it involved the Lingyuan Sect.

514
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,790
No wonder you took the risk

515
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,500

00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,620
no matter when,

549
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:30,280
and even if you have to pay a heavy price,

550
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,380
you can't refuse it.

551
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:35,720
For people in the martial world,

552
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,940
words must be honest, actions must be bold,

553
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:41,260
and promises must be fulfilled with sincerity.

554
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,900
If you need anything,

555
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:46,990
I'll definitely do it for you.

556
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,170
Okay.

557
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,760
I'll set off for the east coast tomorrow.

558
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:52,600
But for now,

559
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:55,570
come with me to another place.

560
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,520
If I'm not mistaken,

561
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,440
is it the government dungeon?

562
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,310
Is there anything that you can't foresee?

563
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,230
Let's go.

564
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:13,930
Help!

565
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,280
Behave yourself!

566
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:16,530
Don't move.

567
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:18,940
Hold her down.

568
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,310
Don't move.

569
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:23,950
Behave!

570
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:31,690
-My lord.
-My lord.

571
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,740
We've been keeping a close watch as you ordered.

572
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:34,740
She hasn't been untied for even a moment.

573
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,010
But when I came to deliver food to her,

574
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:38,510
who would have thought

575
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,430
this crazy woman would bite her tongue off—

576
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,360
Get a doctor to stitch up the wound and stop the bleeding.

577
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,850
Keep her alive no matter what.

578
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:45,570
Yes.

579
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,840
Have you ever expected this situation?

580
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,930
It doesn't matter. As long as she's alive.

581
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:06,780
My lord.

582
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:08,540
Do you think

583
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,010
Princess has ever suspected us these past few days?

584
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,550
With her intelligence,

585
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,420
I'm afraid she has already sensed that something's off.

586
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,880
After all, Prince Fu is her biological father.

587
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,159
No one can hide or escape from this matter.

588
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:25,080
My lord.

589
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,429
Are you going on this trip to avoid Prince Fu

590
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,989
or to really help Yun Xiang with his investigation?

591
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:34,340
I can handle this trip to the east coast on my own.

592
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,550
It's also just right to lure Prince Fu's spies away.

593
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,100
Go back to Nandu immediately.

594
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,710
I don't need to teach you how to investigate, right?

595
00:34:42,010 --> 00:34:42,570
Don't worry, my lord.

596
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:43,949
I know what to do.

597
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,380
One more lap! One more lap!

598
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:56,670
No.

599
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,870
Everyone's asleep. You're the only energetic one.

600
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:00,080
Let me tell you.

601
00:35:00,210 --> 00:35:01,120
This is the last lap, boss.

602
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,460
Lower your voice. Lower your voice.

603
00:35:18,050 --> 00:35:18,720
Are they all asleep?

604
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,440
Yes.

605
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:21,720
It's really not easy.

606
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:28,870
What happened to your arm?

607
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:34,110
These kids had a fight before.

608
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,460
I tried to stop them and got bit.

609
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,500
Look, these teeth aren't fully grown yet.

610
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,540
There are so many gaps.

611
00:35:40,550 --> 00:35:42,560
These kids have no manners.

612
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,210
Let me apply some medication for you.

613
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,830
No need. My skin is rough and my flesh is thick.

614
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:52,750
I'm fine.

615
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,290
No, you have to apply the medication.

616
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:09,450
Tianhu.

617
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,900
I'm not used to having someone

618
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,160
take care of me yet.

619
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,390
Tianhu, I...

620
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,870
What's wrong? Are you sad?

621
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:22,940
Tell me.

622
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,000
Let me be happy too.

623
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:27,470
Something sad?

624
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,670
Recently, everything has been going well for me.

625
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,040
Something great's about to be accomplished.

626
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,060
Really?

627
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:37,330
But why did I hear that Shu doesn't want you anymore?

628
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,460
It's only been a few days.

629
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:43,090
How have you become so gossipy?

630
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:46,660
Quick, tell me what happened.

631
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,410
In my opinion,

632
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,530
although Shu doesn't say it,

633
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,320
deep down, she's already completely devoted to you.

634
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:57,620
Did you do something unethical

635
00:37:57,970 --> 00:37:58,810
to piss her off?

636
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,160
Tell me quickly.

637
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,650
Listen, I don't care about others.

638
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,710
But Shu's like my brother.

639
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,810
I can't watch you two like this.

640
00:38:08,530 --> 00:38:11,670
If that brother broke your heart...

641
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,850
If my beloved ones hurt me,

642
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:18,990
I'll take it.

643
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,410
If Shu really hurt you this time,

644
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:25,590
there must have been a reason.

645
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,780
Apart from other things,

646
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,750
think about when you were protecting the raw silk,

647
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:30,700
or competing against Tang Xiao.

648
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,610
She risked her life to help you every time.

649
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,340
You can't always think about

650
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,810
how she's hurting you now.

651
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:38,780
Let me tell you.

652
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,550
There are many people wandering in the martial world.

653
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,170
You can't find many ones who'd risk their life for you.

654
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:49,730
How about this?

655
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,130
Where is she? I'll bring her here.

656
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:54,410
Whatever problems the two of you are having, talk it out in person.

657
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,990
Can you stop talking about me?

658
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,060
Look at yourself.

659
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,080
You take one step forward and then two steps back.

660
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,630
Stop nagging.

661
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,520
Right.

662
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,600
Let me ask you.

663
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,460
Is there true love in this world?

664
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:15,870
What?

665
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,280
Look.

666
00:39:20,130 --> 00:39:20,750
At first,

667
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:23,270
because you had to repay a small gambling debt to me,

668
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:26,620
I devised for you to stay and offer me thorough protection.

669
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,390
We settle the wages on a daily basis.

670
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,830
But by now, you should have already repaid

671
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,570
your whole debt.

672
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,670
I'm glad you know.

673
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:36,410
I cleared the debt half a month ago.

674
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:37,610
Then, I don't understand.

675
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,010
In the martial world,

676
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,590
you're known for being a lone wolf.

677
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:44,340
Since your debt is cleared,

678
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,800
why are you still here?

679
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,380
What do you mean by that?

680
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:51,190
I asked you first.

681
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,470
Answer my question, and then I'll answer yours.

682
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,050
I don't do business that incurs losses.

683
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,350
The foundling home isn't fully established yet.

684
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,800
I can't leave just yet.

685
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,980
And there's no other reason?

686
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:06,960
Other...

687
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,340
Why are you still the one asking questions?

688
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,910
It's your turn to answer my question.

689
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,930
My second query is still a part of the same question.

690
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,060
We'll talk about another question

691
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,340
after you're done answering mine.

692
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,220
In the ruthless martial world,

693
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,700
I've met some people I disdain.

694
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:36,010
With them, I only talked about business.

695
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,060
I never spoke more than I need to.

696
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:42,490
After a long time, life got boring.

697
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,480
But after coming to Nandu,

698
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,110
the people and things I've met were quite interesting.

699
00:40:55,810 --> 00:40:57,000
Since I've had a taste of this interesting life,

700
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,700
I don't want to go back

701
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:02,280
to living like I have no tomorrow.

702
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,330
In the past, when I closed my eyes,

703
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,200
I just thought about having survived another day.

704
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:07,880
It was a profit.

705
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:10,740
Whether I'd be dead or alive the next day

706
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,110
woul all be up to God.

707
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,700
Now, when I close my eyes,

708
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:24,110
I think about this person and that person.

709
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,180
It's all very interesting.

710
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:33,600
To be honest, I'm thinking

711
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,110
if I should live in a different way.

712
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,070
I don't need to wait until my next life.

713
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:53,760
I don't know about others.

714
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,280
But I know for sure that since you're by my side,

715
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:00,530
I must still be of value to you.

716
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:02,430
What?

717
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,160
Say that again.

718
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,140
You still won't admit it?

719
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:09,810
Yun.

720
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,380
I found you interesting,

721
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:12,640
so I thought highly of you and regarded you as a friend.

722
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,540
Don't be shameless.

723
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,960
Warrior Jin, please spare my life.

724
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:19,020
I still have important things that need your help in the future.

725
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,180
Don't even think about it.

726
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,480
I know you'll definitely help me.

727
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,810
Thank you, Warrior Jin.

728
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:20,520
The most fervent emotions in the world

729
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,090
are love and hatred.

730
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,870
Love makes one blind,

731
00:43:36,210 --> 00:43:39,210
and hatred disrupts the mind.

732
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,260
When people and emotions are intertwined,

733
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,220
they lose their perceptiveness.

734
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,890
Then, it'll be hard to have the world in one's mind.

735
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,430
How much did you drink?
