Leave!

6
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,080
That brute gave the order.

7
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,880
I'll have to kill myself after killing you.

8
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:10,690
I can only live if you're alive.

9
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,620
Leave.

10
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,010
Go!

00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,910
Mr. Yun is here.

13
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,500
Let's go. Hurry.

14
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,570
Mr. Yun, what's going on?

15
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:12,980
Jin.

16
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:13,940
Don't come near me.

00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,500
Run!

21
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,260
Let's go together.

22
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,540
You're so astute.

23
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:31,690
You should know one of us dying is better than all of us dying.

24
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:37,770
You should also know what I want to entrust.

00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,000
It's good that you escaped.

41
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,260
Don't leave yet.

42
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,670
I'll make you another bracelet.

Boss, no need.

44
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,380
I still have the one you made for me last time.

Listen to me.

46
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,020
You still have to be careful no matter how skilled you are.

53
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,100
Lady Kou, let me report to you.

54
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:07,620
Judging from the traces,

55
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,700
a total of three people broke into Datong Firm at night.

56
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,040
The traitor should be Yan San, who acted in concert with them from the inside

57
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,820
and attempted to steal the ledgers.

58
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:16,920
Yan San.

59
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,200
Do you know this person?

60
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:20,650
Go on talking.

61
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,100
Yan San was already killed when we arrived.

62
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:24,930
So we went after the swordsman immediately.

63
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,120
But we didn't expect that the swordsman has such great skills.

64
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,360
Approximately more than 20 people altogether died by his sword.

65
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:30,960
Have you checked

66
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:33,140
if the ledgers indeed haven't been swapped?

67
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,730
We've checked them carefully

68
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,450
and have destroyed them all.

69
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,580
What are the characteristics of the person who escaped by boat?

70
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:41,640
He's around 30 and looks like a scholar.

71
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,010
I haven't seen him fight.

72
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,590
I don't think he knows martial arts.

73
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,350
Has he been injured?

74
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,230
No.

75
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,220
But he's quite good at running for his life.

76
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,770
Lady Kou. May I ask where you're going?

77
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,510
Do I need to report to you where I'm going?

78
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,340
That's not what I meant.

79
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,190
It's just that such an incident happened,

80
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,220
why don't you stay in Yangzhou

81
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,690
and take charge of the situation for us?

82
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,670
Is this your thought

83
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,200
or Nangong Fang's thought?

84
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,600
Mr. Nangong sent us a letter a few days ago,

85
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,170
saying that if you come to Yangzhou,

86
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,410
you may as well stay for a few more days.

87
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,740
The swordsman you saw last night is called Jin Biao.

88
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,790
He's known as the Best Swordsman of Yangzhou.

89
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,390
He charges ten taels of gold for a single deal.

90
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,920
That's why he got the name "Ten Taels of Gold."

91
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:41,030
I've never had a chance

92
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,220
to compete with him.

93
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:45,410
I heard that he alone killed more than 20 of you.

94
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,590
I wonder how many I could have killed

95
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,170
if it were me.

98
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,290
When we arrived at the pier,

99
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,740
we saw blood everywhere.

100
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,670
The dead bodies were all cleared away.

101
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:48,300
We only found this sheath on the riverbank.

102
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:17,550
Mr. Yun.

103
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,340
You lost one thing.

104
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,230
Your favorite sword.

105
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,430
I only found the sheath,

106
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:31,980
but I don't know where I can go

107
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,060
to return it to you now.

108
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,440
You also lost one more thing.

109
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,730
You lost your life.

110
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,700
I don't know what I should give to you in return.

111
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,670
You once said that I'm warm-hearted.

112
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:07,810
I know it clearly

113
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,620
that I only care about my own interests.

114
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,260
I'm afraid of death.

115
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,390
I have absolutely no idea what brotherhood is.

116
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,450
Let Heaven be the witness.

117
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:55,900
I, Yun Xiang,

118
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:02,380
would like to become sworn brothers with you, Jin Biao,

119
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,060
known as Ten Taels of Gold,

120
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:11,540
at this moment of the day.

121
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,510
From now on, we'll trust each other with our lives,

122
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:19,480
share weal and woe,

123
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,950
and become sworn brothers.

124
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,240
How many times have I told you?

125
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,340
You're still so garrulous.

126
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,020
You and I have been like brothers long ago.

127
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,580
There's no need for such formalities.

128
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:40,100
Here.

[Shao's Residence]

130
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,530
Stop knocking. There's no one in the courtyard.

131
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,670
Prince Fu left Nandu yesterday morning.

132
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:19,840
How could it be?

133
00:20:21,190 --> 00:20:22,410
I haven't given him the register yet.

134
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,970
You and Lord Liu came to Nandu.

135
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:35,370
Who exactly do you want to investigate?

136
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,010
Lord Liu wants to see you.

137
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,250
I've gotten some results on the matter you asked me to investigate.

138
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:44,530
Thank you, Lord Liu.

139
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:46,940
I've also found out something during this period of time.

140
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,220
The mastermind behind the east-coast land purchase case back then

141
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,480
was Nangong Fang.

142
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:54,140
Maybe it was Nangong Fang.

143
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,430
But we should put the saddle on the right horse.

144
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,460
According to the clues I've been following and investigating,

145
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,490
the person behind him is your real enemy.

146
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,540
Fang Mingru, Censorate Censor,

147
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,880
was killed by bandits on his way back to his hometown.

148
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,160
No one from his family was spared.

149
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:13,210
Zhong Jingshan, Censorate Censor,

150
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,900
was convicted of collusion with the rebel party.

151
00:21:15,150 --> 00:21:15,850
His three clans were exterminated.

152
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,920
Fan Zhishu, Censorate Censor,

153
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,690
was convicted of forming a private clique, taking bribes, and perverting justice.

154
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,080
His three clans were exterminated.

155
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,710
All of them were officials in the Censorate.

156
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:29,750
Li Bo,

157
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,450
skip the ones in the middle.

158
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:34,140
You just need to know that I've found out about eight people in total in my investigation.

159
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,040
They all suffered the tragedy of family extermination.

160
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,560
Go on.

161
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,660
Luo Sizhong, Censorate Censor,

162
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,440
resigned from the official post in the 26th year of Tianqing

163
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,740
and returned to his hometown, Luo family's village in the east coast.

164
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:47,840
In the autumn of the same year,

165
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,330
the villagers of Luo family's village colluded with the pirates and disturbed coastal defenses,

166
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:54,100
so the Nandu Criminal Investigation Service Office sent troops to eliminate them.

167
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,420
Upon investigation,

168
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,390
the evidence was solid and the case was closed.

169
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,260
Luo Sizhong

170
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,190
should count as your granduncle from the same clan.

171
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:06,110
Do you still remember him?

172
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:11,350
Those censors all suffered family extermination.

173
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,700
I wanted to find out what they had in common.

174
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,320
In the end, I found that everything

175
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,350
can be traced back to the 21st year of Tianqing.

176
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:17,960
My lord,

177
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,130
are you really going to tell him about these?

178
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,920
I think, next, Lord Liu is going to talk with me

179
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,470
about the third deal, right?

180
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,220
Since you've guessed it,

181
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,570
why not go on to guess

182
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,470
what the third deal is?

183
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,820
You've come to Nandu this time

184
00:22:43,350 --> 00:22:45,280
for more than simply investigating the water ghost robbery case.

185
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,580
Why did you say so?

186
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:49,610
Lift up the fishing rod.

187
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:58,720
With Prince Fu's influence,

188
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,600
if he wants to deal with Nangong Fang,

189
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,370
he can have lots of means to do so.

190
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:04,860
Why did he choose me?

191
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,220
Because I myself was only too eager to seek revenge.

192
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,680
But then again,

193
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:13,010
why didn't Prince Fu ask you to do it?

194
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,280
After all, you've been his retainer for ten years.

195
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:15,960
How dare you!

196
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,650
In this case, it seems that there's only one answer.

197
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,160
That is, he's afraid of you.

198
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:32,110
And the real purpose of your trip to Nandu

199
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,860
is to investigate Prince Fu.

200
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,920
Such a smart person you are, Young Master Xiang!

201
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,870
Talk about it then.

202
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,610
Why do I need to investigate him?

203
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,170
Things that need you imperial guards to get involved

204
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,570
can only be important state affairs.

205
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:53,470
What counts as important state affairs then?

206
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,610
Plotting a rebellion.

207
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,610
The phrase determines the life and death of so many people,

208
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:07,750
but you were so indifferent

209
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:10,220
when you mentioned it.

210
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,590
By convention,

211
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,260
princes are not allowed to hold power.

212
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,730
But Prince Fu is a rare exception.

213
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,900
Back then, Prince Fu made every effort to help govern the country

214
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,770
and did his utmost to carry out reforms.

215
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,600
He once had the ear of His Majesty too.

216
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,280
Unfortunately, he went too far.

217
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:36,830
The new policy drafted by Prince Fu was too radical

218
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:38,320
and made too many enemies in the imperial court.

219
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,060
In the 21st year of Tianqing,

220
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:42,660
eight censors from the Censorate led officials of all ranks

221
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,260
to submit a joint report to the throne

222
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,480
that enumerated the mistakes of Prince Fu.

223
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:48,060
That was how the fief of Yangzhou came from.

224
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,810
And Prince Fu can never be in the imperial court again.

225
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,440
Now I understand

226
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,010
why you told me

227
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,900
that the third deal would kill me.

228
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,610
Now, the military power has long been in Prince Fu's hands.

229
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:04,720
Not only the officials in Yangzhou,

230
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,320
but half of the officials in Nandu also colluded with him.

231
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,540
He has already taken control of two strong cities, Jiangnan and Jiangbei.

232
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,100
He can both attack and defend.

233
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,540
Of course the imperial court can't allow him to rebel.

234
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:17,870
But once a war starts

235
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:18,810
and rages on,

236
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,020
those who are going to suffer the most are the common people.

237
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,330
So you want to join hands with me

238
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,820
in order to draw support from the Yuntai Sect?

239
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,540
I just want to do my best

240
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:34,510
to nip the upheaval in the bud.

241
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,640
Don't you Yuntai disciples also see it

242
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:40,820
as your duty to protect the common people?

243
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,060
You want to make an alliance with the Yuntai Sect.

244
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,320
Then, Lord Liu, how much do you know

245
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:51,360
about Prince Fu?

246
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,940
At most

247
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,010
fifty percent.

248
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:00,840
At most ten percent.

249
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,080
That's good then.

250
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,520
It means it's a wise move to choose to ally with you.

251
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,620
Mr. Yun, please tell me everything you know.

252
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,300
There are at least 100 businesses in Nangong Fang's name.

253
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,930
If we want to take all of them away overnight,

254
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,830
two thousand people won't be enough for the task.

255
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,060
Lady Kou.

256
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:21,740
Lady Kou.

257
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,870
Uncles, no need to stand on ceremony.

258
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,040
Why are you all here today?

259
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,770
Lady Kou, you've come at the right time.

260
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,210
There's a godsend.

261
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,360
We've been subject to Nangong Fang for so many years.

262
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,740
Finally, we can hold up our heads.

263
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,090
Yuanjie brought back the register of Nangong Fang's businesses?

264
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,140
Lady Kou,

265
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:39,660
how did you know?

266
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,210
No matter what order Madam Kou gave,

267
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,590
please give me a moment.

268
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,020
I'll go and discuss it first. It won't be late to obey the order after that.

269
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:49,140
Thank you.

270
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,210
It's right to take our time when the matter is urgent.

271
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,400
But Yuanjie got the register.

272
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,870
It's indeed a good opportunity for us to get rid of Nangong Fang.

273
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,720
Why wait any longer?

274
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:03,710
I don't think she has any new ideas.

275
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:05,110
Sister,

276
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:07,410
put aside your selfish motives

277
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:10,340
and talk about how well I actually did this time.

278
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,000
Mother.

279
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:15,360
I'm incompetent.

280
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,140
Although I've been following Nangong Fang all the time,

281
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,980
I failed to get a glimpse of his private thoughts.

282
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,400
I just feel that his behavior has been too abnormal recently.

283
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,780
He must have some evil intent.

284
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,520
If we go along with it,

285
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,140
I'm afraid we'll fall into his trap.

286
00:27:28,570 --> 00:27:29,600
Mother, there are things that you don't know.

287
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,460
In order to protect this register

288
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,540
from falling into others' hands,

289
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,970
I had no choice but to kill Ten Taels of Gold and Yun Xiang.

290
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,150
One of them is my sister's friend,

291
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,460
and the other is my sister's true love.

292
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,590
I think she must be heartbroken now.

293
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,330
So she simply wants to ruin my plan.

294
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,020
How foolish you are.

295
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,280
You said you have everything well-planned.

296
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:52,980
Are you sure they are both dead?

297
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:53,560
Of course.

298
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,920
I've never failed in using the Heart Devouring Powder.

299
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,840
But when I went to the pier to clean up the dead bodies,

300
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,520
I couldn't find Yun Xiang.

301
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:03,550
Later, I heard that he has fled back to Nandu by boat.

302
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:04,710
Mother.

303
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,110
Yun Xiang has an extraordinary retentive memory.

304
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,420
He must have memorized the ledgers clearly.

305
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,460
For the Lingyuan Sect, a slight move may affect the whole situation.

306
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,780
Mother, please make a careful decision.

307
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:16,700
If Yun Xiang is still alive,

308
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:17,860
we'll need to make our move even sooner.

309
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,480
I was hesitating over

310
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:28,540
whether we should directly rob Nangong Fang of his assets

311
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,300
or nurture a business talent in the sect

312
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:33,460
and gradually take over his businesses.

313
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,170
Mother.

314
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:36,630
Don't think too much if you want to make great achievements.

315
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:39,210
The Yuntai Sect has already known the details of Nangong Fang's businesses.

316
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,770
They'll definitely do something.

317
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:42,620
A delay would lead to changes in the situation.

318
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,900
Under the current circumstance,

319
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:46,600
it's about making a move sooner and faster than the other.

320
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:47,750
Mother.

321
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:51,060
I'm willing to go to Nandu personally and kill Yun Xiang.

322
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,570
Then, I'll take over Nangong Fang's businesses

323
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,810
so that our sect will have no more future trouble.

324
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,010
You're no match for Yun Xiang.

325
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:58,380
You…

326
00:28:59,090 --> 00:28:59,690
Enough.

327
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:00,860
Mother.

328
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,180
We've had more than ten captains

329
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,250
and their elite subordinates this time.

330
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:05,940
There's no need to let Yuanjie take a risk.

331
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:06,980
Mother, I…

332
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,300
Alright. Stop talking.

333
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,210
You can't go.

334
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:38,040
Sir, do you need a prescription for clearing summer heat?

335
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,010
It's not Minor Heat yet.

336
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,150
A country with two rulers will be dogged by misfortune. But there will be no shortage if you store supplies for future use.

337
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:47,860
You can feel at ease if you have a dose of medicine.

338
00:29:53,530 --> 00:29:54,680
He wants me to return to Yuntai's headquarters immediately?

339
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,390
Since I've delivered Master's order,

340
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,970
I'll leave now.

341
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:01,310
Senior.

342
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,180
A few days ago, Master urgently summoned Mr. Mo back.

343
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:09,570
And now you have to come here personally.

344
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,490
Was I left out last time?

345
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,700
Last time, Master only asked me

346
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,770
to summon back Mo Bufan and Kang Qiao.

347
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,290
He didn't mention you, Mr. Yun.

348
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:22,430
Then why did he leave me here for a few more days?

349
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,980
Master's order isn't something you or I can speculate.

350
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,260
Yun Xiang.

351
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,900
Even if you're Master's favorite direct disciple,

352
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,570
you can't be arrogant

353
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,640
or break the sect rules.

354
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,940
Yun, you want to see us?

355
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,490
In the past, you were most annoyed with these gamblers.

356
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:32,260
Why are you watching them so attentively today?

357
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,570
Mr. Yun is probably not watching them having fun.

358
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,250
It just suddenly comes to my mind

359
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,100
that there were several times that I was standing here,

360
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:48,350
watching Jin bickering with her.

361
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,380
At that time, Mr. Su

362
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,940
was still pursuing Miss Ke.

363
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,380
I couldn't stand the scene of bustle and excitement

364
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,480
back then.

365
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,030
But I don't know since when

366
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,400
I started to crave such bustle and nuances of life.

367
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,620
I used to think that numerous bright stars

368
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:23,720
can't compare with the lonely shining moon.

369
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:28,350
But in the end, in the whole Nandu City,

370
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,510
only the noisy Liansheng House

371
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,530
can make me feel a little sense of liveliness.

372
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:39,240
It's still lively here,

373
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:42,730
but things have already changed.

374
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,560
Everything has fallen apart.

375

Yun.

376
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,760
At least Menglan and I are still here.

377
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:57,610
Follow me.

378
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,530
Yun.

379
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:15,210
Are you leaving?

380
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,800
Do you remember we bought Liansheng House together at auction?

381
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:22,620
But you are the ones

382
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:24,160
who have been managing and operating it all the way.

383
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:28,820
Today, I'll transfer this asset to you,

384
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,470
so as to avoid a sense of guilt in my heart.

385

[Title Deed]

386
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:36,380
Where are you going?

387
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,600
Are you coming back?

388
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:47,700
I also have a 30% share in the property of Tang's Gambling House.

389
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:49,800
I'll transfer it to you too.

390
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,140
According to Jin, these two assets

391
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:53,850
are enough to cover the expenses of Jishan Hall

392
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,890
for more than a hundred years.

393
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:00,880
Mr. Yun.

394
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,730
Jin once told me

395
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,300
that he wanted you to personally educate the kids

396
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,159
in Jishan Hall.

397
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,489
I'm too ashamed

398
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:16,570
to face Tianhu and those kids.

399
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,360
I'll entrust Jishan Hall to you two.

400
00:34:20,989 --> 00:34:22,010
You are more reliable than me.

401
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,590
Next, I have a few words

402
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,030
that I hope you two can keep in mind.

403
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,530
I tried in every way to come into contact with the Su family

404
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:42,719
because I had no one to rely on

405
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:44,800
when I first came to Nandu City.

406
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,520
So I could only pretend to be friendly.

407
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,940
But then I turned around

408
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,489
and burned Yufeng Warehouse,

409
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,030
inducing the Cao Sect to fight with you.

410
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:03,440
By the time when you woke up to it,

411
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,720
it was already too late,

412
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,620
and you had no choice but to join hands with me.

413
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:10,640
All the deals after that,

414
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,200
I either lured you into them with benefits

415
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,960
or forced you into them with harm.

416
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,610
My relationship with the Su family

417
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,280
is not master and apprentice, let alone friends.

418
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,260
Everything in the past was about profits.

419
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,670
That's not the truth.

420
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,980
That's not the truth.

421
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:59,170
I caused all the trouble.

422
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,430
But now, you're the only ones

423
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:06,940
who are closest to me.

424
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,150
Maybe only when I completely break up my relationship with you

425
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:14,110
can you be kept safe.

426
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:16,090
But remember,

427
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,730
in the future, if anyone wants to give you a hard time,

428
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:22,420
you must tell him what I just said.

Please come back often.

Mingyu,

436
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,660
you've matured a lot after several experiences,

437
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:54,450
but I've never seen a trace of worldliness from you.

438
00:36:56,420 --> 00:36:57,650
Manager Ke is a person of great strength and softness.

439
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,260
She is also an extraordinary lady.

440
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,270
Jin always talks about money

441
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,060
but keeps righteousness in his heart.

442
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,520
I used to pride myself on understanding everything in the world thoroughly.

443
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,210
I thought all interactions are about profits.

444
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:14,710
Thank you.

445
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,120
You made me understand

446
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,110
that the most precious thing in the world

447
00:37:20,850 --> 00:37:22,280
is camaraderie.

448
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:29,820
I've been feeling guilty for what I did in the past for a long time.

449

Please feel free to tell me.

You're meticulous in planning.

Why did you become as impetuous as me?

481
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,290
I still remember when Mr. Wen went down the mountain,

482
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,450
we said our farewells here.

483
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,090

00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:13,440
that if I insist on taking revenge,

00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:16,600
I'll bring myself an unbearable price.

486
00:40:18,390 --> 00:40:19,830

Later I realized

that it was Nangong Fang

00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,020
who deliberately made us drop our guard

492
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:32,690
and made a scene in Nandu City.

493
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:35,740
Gradually, we began to be arrogant and willful.

00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,770
Doesn't such a ruthless trick

I was about to tell you about this.

504

Now, important people placed by the sect

00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:06,790
in every government office

506
00:41:07,010 --> 00:41:08,100
were all summoned back.

Such many people are involved.

508
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,620
Is it just to announce the identity of the sect master?

509
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,920
What matters is

510
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,660
what exactly he wants to do after announcing his identity.

511
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,520
I've asked a few close fellow apprentices.

512
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:25,200
They also think Master's arrangement

513
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:26,380
is very strange.

514
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:28,210
So, Mr. Mo,

515
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:32,770
have you ever thought about who Master really is?

516
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:17,050

517
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,420
Madam Kou.

518
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:28,260
We had more than 2,000 elite subordinates. All of them were annihilated.

519
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,580
All of them were annihilated?

520
00:42:53,030 --> 00:42:53,650
Here's a secret letter from Yuntai.

522
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:07,380
You really have a very careful plan.

523
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:09,880
I wonder how shocked the Kou family would be

524
00:43:09,910 --> 00:43:11,440
after hearing the news.

525
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:13,540
If it were me,

526
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:17,060
I definitely wouldn't have concluded that Kou Yuanjie sneaked back to Nandu this time

527
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:18,330
in order to join hands with Yun Xiang.

528
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,150
You took advantage of this relationship

529
00:43:20,830 --> 00:43:23,010
to convince them of the theft of the ledgers.

530
00:43:23,550 --> 00:43:24,100
Therefore,

531
00:43:24,700 --> 00:43:27,970
Kou Yan dispatched all her elite subordinates.

532
00:43:28,630 --> 00:43:31,440
Then the defense soldiers of Yangzhou besieged them and annihilated them with firearms.

533
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:37,820
I clearly told you

534
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,020
not to give Yun Xiang a hard time.

535
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:41,230
But what did your men do?

536
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:45,470
They almost killed him!

537
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:47,990
Please calm down.

538
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,010
Something must have gone wrong when transmitting the order.

539
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,230
I'll go back and investigate it now.

540
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:52,900
If only something had gone wrong.

541
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,200
Now the arrangement has been made.

542
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,120
I need not say more

543
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:02,490
about what to do next, right?

544
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:03,590
Yes.

545
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:07,980
Mingzhu.

546
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:09,580
Come in.

547
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,460
Here, have a seat.

548
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,330
How much of the conversation did you hear just now?

549
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,120
Father,

550
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,120
did you know long ago

551
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:44,010
that Nangong Fang is from the Lingyuan Sect?

552
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:53,150
Not only did I know,

553
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,780
but I was exactly the one who ordered him to join the Lingyuan Sect.

554
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:05,340
Mingzhu.

555
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:08,430
I've been hiding a lot from you these years.

556
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,300
But from now on,

557
00:45:11,010 --> 00:45:12,730
I'll gradually tell you about it all.

558
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:16,210
Father,

559
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:18,050
what exactly do you want to do?

560
00:45:22,420 --> 00:45:23,410
Come here.

561
00:45:29,550 --> 00:45:29,920
Sit down.

562
00:45:46,870 --> 00:45:47,720
What do you think?

563
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:53,680
If there's really such a day

564
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:55,430
that I'm going to stage an uprising,

565
00:45:55,740 --> 00:45:56,490
what will you do?

566
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:09,760
Mingzhu, as you know,

567
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:13,480
I've been summoned to Beidu many times over the years.

568
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:16,840
How could I not know what's in His Majesty's mind?

569
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:18,980
But I never told you,

570
00:46:19,220 --> 00:46:20,080
not because I couldn't tell you,

571
00:46:21,850 --> 00:46:22,630
but because I didn't have the heart to do so.

572
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:25,440
His Majesty is not feeling well lately.

573
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:26,700
The Crown Prince is still young.

574
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:27,880
Now

575
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,970
I've become the biggest hidden trouble of the imperial court.

576
00:46:31,890 --> 00:46:34,600
I'm now the target of public criticism in the imperial court.

577
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,170
It's impossible for me to escape.

578
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,230
Father.

579
00:46:39,490 --> 00:46:40,610
I already lost my mother.

580
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:42,730
I can't afford to lose you, Father.

581
00:46:44,450 --> 00:46:46,520
Just because I've promised your mother

582
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,100
I must protect you and let you grow up safely,

583
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:51,260
I have no choice but to do so.

584
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:54,350
Now, only if I take over the territory

585
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:55,910
and become the emperor

586
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:58,640
can you continue

587
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:00,320
to live a safe and carefree life.

588
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:02,570
Father.

589
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,230
You're not doing it for me.

590
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:07,820
We can forget the bubble reputation

591
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:09,100
and live in seclusion.

592
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:12,210
We can live a simple life too.

593
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,210
I just want you to live well, Father.

594
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:17,650
Mingzhu.

595
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:21,680
We can only live if we win.

596
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,590
Now, even if we flee to the end of the world,

597
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:26,810
it would be useless.

598
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:31,620
We might still survive only if we stage an uprising.

599
00:47:32,330 --> 00:47:33,450
If we follow the prescribed order,

600
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:34,980
when the Crown Prince ascends the throne,

601
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,260
to avoid any future trouble, the imperial court

602
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:40,820
will never allow me to keep my family line.

603
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,820
I can give up my life for this,

604
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:47,200
but how can I bear to lose you?

605
00:47:50,050 --> 00:47:53,410
Is there no other way for us?

606
00:47:56,860 --> 00:47:58,180
Being in the imperial family,

607
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,640
lots of our choices are involuntary.

608
00:48:11,810 --> 00:48:14,610
You can still shed tears to the fullest today.

609
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:20,140
But in the future, you'll need to be tough.
