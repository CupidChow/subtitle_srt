[Episode 23: The Detective Cracks the Mysterious Case]

4
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,520
The Grand Coordinator of Jiangnan

5
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:11,470
was afraid that he would have to take the blame,

6
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,510
so he preemptively filed a complaint against Magistrate Shao.

7
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,660
After Magistrate Shao heard about this,

8
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,810
he passed out on the spot.

9
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,980
Now he has no intention to investigate the case.

10
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,700
If I'm right,

11
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,079
all of the government offices in Nandu

12
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,530
are pushing the responsibility onto each other.

13
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,980
No one is willing to lead the investigation.

14
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:34,790
Indeed.

15
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,610
On the first day of the incident,

16
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,940
clues should have been gathered

17
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,240
to identify the suspect.

18
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,420
But that great opportunity was delayed

19
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,980
by their selfish intentions.

20
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:48,820
Yun.

21
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,280
Why do I feel like you don't want the government to solve this case?

22
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:57,790
Clever.

23
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,860
Indeed.

24
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,130
I'm just sighing for the people of Nandu.

25
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,620
What else did he say?

26
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:06,850
Tell me in detail.

27
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,690
Don't leave anything out.

28
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:09,120
Okay.

29
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,700
This is what Constable Wang said.

30
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:14,810
This case is really strange.

31
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,220
There is no trace of any fighting on the boat.

32
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,900
There were more than 30 official soldiers on this towboat.

33
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,440
None of them could be found, dead or alive.

34
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:26,010
So this must have been an inside job.

35
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,660
Young Master, watch what you say.

36
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,680
Careless words may cause disaster.

37
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,060
People are in a state of panic now.

38
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:36,640
Don't mention those words that you've just said again.

39
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,640
The more one is not allowed to talk about it,

40
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,370
the more suspicious it is.

41
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:50,310
If

42
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,500
it really were an inside job, it would be a heinous crime

43
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,980
in which the soldier's family will be executed.

44
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,620
I think their wives and children

45
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:02,610
are still in Nandu.

46
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,040
But an official soldier's annual salary

47
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,600
is less than 300 taels.

48
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,670
It’s possible that a soldier abandoned his wife and son

49
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,530
in the face of 100,000 taels of official silver.

50
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,890
There are over 30 people on a boat.

51
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,779
Even if they all abandoned their wives and children,

52
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:18,950
it's impossible that not a word

53
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:19,779
came out of it.

54
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,959
What else did he say?

55
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,720
100,000 taels of official silver

56
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,030
and your family's tributary cloth

57
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,740
couldn't have been transported away easily.

58
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,909
As long as they came ashore,

59
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,909
evidence of skid marks and horse hoof prints should have been left behind.

60
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,140
The four patrol camps of the Grand Coordinator's office

61
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,590
have searched over 40 km

62
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,300
along the river shores,

63
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,550
but there was no trace of evidence.

64
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,360
If so,

65
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,760
maybe they didn't go ashore at all

66
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,780
and directly transported them along the river?

67
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,500
Even if he sailed throughout the night,

68
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,090
how far could he have gone before dawn?

69
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,520
Once the day broke,

70
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:57,610
the boat would have had nowhere to hide.

71
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,780
We've asked around at all of the fisheries and wharfs

72
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,700
in the surrounding.

73
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:04,330
No one has seen a boat with a deep draft carrying heavy things.

74
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,740
This matter is indeed strange.

75
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,980
Even the rumors on the streets are varied.

76
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,110
There's even a rumor about the silver being stolen by some water ghost.

77
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,140
Do you think it's related to the government robbery case?

78
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,810
Mr. Su, what do you think?

79
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,280
It's not a chaotic time now.

80
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,100
All over the world,

81
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,130
there are not many people who can take action against the government.

82
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,540
If it's really the same group of people,

83
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,630
there's indeed something puzzling about it.

84
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,960
Go on.

85
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,460
I think the perpetrators

86
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,940
of the government robbery case

87
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,120
weren't after money,

88
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,930
but were trying to frame Guanghui Bank.

89
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,530
But if that's the case,

90
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,110
and if this robbery of the official boat

91
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,909
were to frame Mr. Yun and Mr. Mo,

92
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,159
it should be absolutely impossible.

93
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,700
You have a point.

94
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,990
But what if you think about it one step further?

95
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,700
I was only able to figure it out to this stage.

96
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:55,650
Two groups of robbers appeared at the same time in Nandu.

97
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:57,760
Their methods are very similar

98
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,370
and equally brilliant.

99
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,460
I don't believe it's just a coincidence.

100
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:04,810
They must be of the same group.

101
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,700
So it wasn’t their purpose

102
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:09,130
to frame Guanghui Bank before,

103
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,700
but just a means.

104
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,120
Then, according to your opinion,

105
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,820
the last time Guanghui Bank was framed

106
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,340
was not to take down Mr. Mo,

107
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,400
but for some other motive.

108
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,040
Mingyu.

109
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,960
It's not that I don't want to tell you more.

110
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,400
But I'm afraid this water ghost robbery case

111
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,090
may cause a huge uproar.

112
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,270
I don’t want you to get too involved.

113
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,220
But we don’t know where the tributary cloth is now.

114
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,480
How can I just stand by and watch?

115
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,920
I just don't know what I should do.

116
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,780
The reputation as the century-old royal silk supplier

117
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,620
is the foundation of the Su family.

118
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,900
The tributary cloth is also of the utmost importance.

119
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,340
Have you taken care of the Textile Department?

120
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,080
Don't worry about this.

121
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,950
I've taken care of it by having some familiar eunuchs

122
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,340
pay them off generously.

123
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,720
They also said they could delay the deadline for me

124
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,420
and have found a new batch of weavers

125
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:11,510
to rush the production of the tributary cloth.

126

Why are you back?

00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,090
Look.

185
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:58,130
The clouds have been dispelled and the sun has emerged. This is God's will.

186
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,900
Sister, you want to kill me?

187
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,650
Since you repeatedly refused to listen to my advice,

188
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,180
I'll just have to kidnap you back to Jiangbei.

189
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,480
Sure. Come on.

190
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,920
Let Bi Yuewu take my dead body back.

191
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,410
Lady Yanan, if you blame him,

192
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:42,790
please kill me.

193
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,120
Don't hurt Young Master.

194
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:51,650
Follow me.

195
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,610
I stayed here when I first came to Nandu.

196
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,220
There was a murder in this house.

197
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,390
There are also some exaggerated rumors.

198
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,290
Few people come around in this vicinity.

199
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,340
You stay here for now.

200
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,650
Don't go back to the inn

201
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,020
in case the official soldiers see you.

202
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,370
Sister.

203
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,250
Don't go yet.

204
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:27,770
It's been a long time since we've had a proper conversation.

205
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,790
Yuewu, go outside and stand guard.

206
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,560
Sister, here.

207
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:48,790
Have this.

208
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:58,580
We siblings grew up without a home,

209
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,960
traveling all around with Mother.

210
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,170
She was busy with the affairs of the sect.

211
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,590
Outside, we encountered poisonous insects and beasts,

212
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,610
or were hunted by the official soldiers.

213
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,980
There were countless close calls

214
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,250
but you always helped me avoid and prevent disaster.

215
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:24,500
Sister.

216
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:27,190
Why did you leave then without saying goodbye?

217
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,580
Do you know how my life was like for the past three years?

218
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,340
You don't know

219
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:36,460
why I left then?

220
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,710
[Three years ago]

221
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,200
My lord.

222
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,020
Lingyuan Sect's token.

223
00:15:06,290 --> 00:15:07,340
It's indeed Lingyuan Sect's rebel faction.

224
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,050
I don't want to kill you all today.

225
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,470
Get lost.

226
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,620
Young lady.

227
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,570
Surrender and we'll spare your life.

228
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:51,470
Mother.

229
00:15:56,690 --> 00:16:00,060
[Lingyuan Sect's Master, Kou Yan]

230
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,310
Three years ago,

231
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:09,270
you betrothed me to Nangong Fang.

232
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,610
I wanted to leave secretly and never come back.

233
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,270
I didn't expect you to chase me down.

234
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,700
Do you have to leave?

235
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:25,020
The people of the Lingyuan Sect are not attached to living and not afraid of death.

236
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,930
They also don't know what they'll descend into.

237
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,600
I'm unfilial.

238
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,410
I've let you down.

239
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,320
But I'll never agree to this marriage

240
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,030
with Nangong Fang.

241
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,720
You knew how to prioritize the general interest since you were young.

242
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:43,670
Why are you so willful today?

243
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,430
Mother.

244
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,450
Nangong Fang's proposal

245
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,260
seems like a display of loyalty to the Kou family,

246
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:51,130
but he's clearly overstepping his authority.

247
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,260
If he succeeds once,

248
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:55,710
he'll think the Kou family is afraid of him.

249
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,040
In the future, he'll become even worse

250
00:16:58,270 --> 00:16:59,100
and more reckless.

251
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:02,620
How could you not have figured out his motive?

252
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,920
You're indeed my daughter.

253
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,950
I can see the situation clearly.

254
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,180
Nangong Fang has indeed overstepped his authority

255
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,089
by daring to make a marriage proposal.

256
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:20,410
If I rejected him in public

257
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,190
and humiliated him,

258
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:23,420
he would have been aggrieved.

259
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:26,069
Instead, we could take this opportunity

260
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,089
to have you next to him,

261
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,490
so we can monitor his every move.

262
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,060
Then, we can control him

263
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,090
and this would serve the Kou family.

264
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,850
Isn't that better?

265
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:40,110
But do you think Nangong Fang won't see through your ploy?

266
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:42,330
Then, how will he treat me?

267
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,250
It's a little dangerous.

268
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:50,730
But for the interests of the sect,

269
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,600
I have to give it a try.

270
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,460
You won't let me down, will you?

271
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,670
For the interests of the sect,

272
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:09,570
we have to choose the lesser of two evils, right?

273
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,580
But I'm your biological daughter.

274
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:28,840
I know.

275
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,390
Nangong Fang has become too big a deal to ignore.

276
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,530
In order to prevent internal strife,

277
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,330
we must be extremely cautious.

278
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:41,100
I didn't leave this time just to escape the marriage.

279
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:43,190
I'll definitely find a way to deal with him.

280
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,580
You've always had a strong personality since you were young.

281
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,910
If I insist on taking you back,

282
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,980
will you threaten me with your death?

283
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,540
I'll figure something out on this trip. I won't let you down.

284
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:09,270
I won't be disappointed.

285
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:14,130
I'll just pretend that I'd never given birth to you.

286
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:27,930
She really went senile!

287
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,700
Who was the one who put Nangong Fang in an important position in the first place?

288
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,110
Then, when the situation went out of control,

289
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,870
she wants to use her own daughter to make a deal?

290
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,780
Don't talk nonsense.

291
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,740
Did I say anything wrong?

292
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,210
If she hadn't been indecisive

293
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:37,330
and caused this disaster,

294
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,020
how would you be in such an unbearable situation?

295
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:42,120
Mother has always prioritized general interests

296
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,150
over personal affections.

297
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:46,440
She had no choice back then.

298
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,850
What do you mean she had no choice?

299
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,100
Back then, she initiated one rebellion after another.

300
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:52,120
Many martyrs were brutally killed by the imperial official soldiers.

301
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,520
As a result, Lingyuan Sect suffered a heavy blow.

302
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,280
That's why Nangong Fang was put in an important position to raise funds

303
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,030
in order to stabilize the situation.

304
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,700
It's all her fault.

305
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,400
Don't mention this ever again.

306
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,260
Back then, Mother initiated one rebellion after another

307
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,510
to secure the Kou family's status in the sect.

308
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,310
Those things are complicated.

309
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,540
They can't be explained in a few words.

310
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,200
Sister,

311
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,850
she was so cruel to you,

312
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:13,060
but you're still trying so hard to defend her.

313
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:17,640
She is my mother.

314
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,630
The two of you are my only family.

315
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,390
Yanan.

316
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,770
You're the only person

317
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,360
I can trust now.

318
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:52,860
Sister.

319
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
There's one more thing I don't understand.

320
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:56,770
What?

321
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,970
You and I both fought against Nangong Fang

322
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,450
to help the Lingyuan Sect break the deadlock.

323
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,400
Now that Ye Xiao's on the edge of the cliff,

324
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,270
I could've killed him without any effort.

325
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,720
Why did you stop me?

326
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,980
If you push Ye Xiao off the cliff,

327
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,750
where will you stand?

328
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,420
I...

329
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,030
Do you know that Young Master Xiang has already guessed that

330
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:21,180
you had another motive for framing Mo Bufan?

331
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,100
He's certain that the official boat robbery wasn't just for money.

332
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,600
So what if he guessed it correctly up to this point?

333
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,850
Do you still not understand?

334
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,690
If this goes on,

335
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,220
he'll soon discover that there's another faction of the Lingyuan Sect

336
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:38,750
in Nandu besides Ye Xiao.

337
00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:39,580
Sister.

338
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,830
You make him sound like a genius.

339
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,720
This level of intelligence is like that of a demon's.

340
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,720
If you know even a little about him,

341
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:49,720
you'll know I'm not exaggerating.

342
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:54,140
Sister.

343
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,220
Are you bewitched by him?

344
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,500
But even if he's exceptionally capable,

345
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:01,950
he was still fooled by you.

346
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,400
I think he cares a lot about you.

347
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:08,080
Let's not talk about this anymore.

348
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:10,630
Listen to me for this matter.

349
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:11,860
Fine.

350
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,850
I'll just wait and see.

351
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,320
But if something unusual happens,

352
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,390
I'll leave the city with Bi Yuewu.

353
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,190
Then you’d better leave now.

354
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:19,930
No.

355
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,220
I can't leave you alone to deal with them.

356
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,160
Think about it.

357
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,260
I know about all of Ye Xiao's plans.

358
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,550
You have control of Yun Xiang's every move.

359
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:29,860
If we work together,

360
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,150
we'd definitely achieve great things.

361
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,640
[Shundong Inn]

362
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,790
Are you going to see Magistrate Shao?

363
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:50,750
Of course.

364
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,550
According to the official rules,

365
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,860
shouldn't we send a name card first?

366
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,980
We'll need the government's cooperation often with this case.

367
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,070
We can't be enemies with Magistrate Shao, can we?

368
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:58,730
Bo.

369
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,730
How long have you been at the Imperial Security department?

370
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,950
Your Highness, it's been over six years.

371
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:05,700
Six years?

372
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:07,850
What's wrong with that?

373
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,740
When imperial guards make visits,

374
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,180
there's only one situation that involves sending a name card first.

375
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,260
That's when you have good news to report.

376
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,760
Right now, in Nandu, serious cases are happening one after another.

377
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,320
Shao Yiheng is to blame.

378
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,640
If we send a name card first,

379
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,330
he'll find an excuse to avoid meeting up with us.

380
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:25,720
Then when will we be able to see him?

381
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,910
Besides, with this case,

382
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,070
we don't just want his cooperation.

383
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,620
We've to do whatever it takes

384
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,660
to make his power available to us for now.

385
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,370
So, to deal with him,

386
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,700
we have to alternate kindness with force.

387
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,790
We can't just be friendly.

388
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:42,110
I get it now.

389
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,990
Your Highness is right.

390
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:45,980
Am I right, Uncle?

391
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,670
Did His Highness teach you all of these?

392
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:49,800
I don't need to be taught.

393
00:23:50,510 --> 00:23:52,700
Officials come in and out of the palace every day.

394
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,700
I simply learned through observation.

395
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,330
Uncle.

396
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,790
Is there not much work in your Imperial Security department?

397
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,900
Otherwise, how has Bo been there for six years

398
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,310
and yet is still a common official?

399
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:08,610
Go easy on him.

400
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,540
But he's indeed only half as smart as you,

401
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,010
so he's being bullied by you.

402
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,280
[Order]

403
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,950
All right, let's go.

404
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:18,780
[Shao’s Residence]

405
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,820
I'd like to propose a toast to Your Highness

406
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,270
with Linjiang Restaurant's Drunken Flower wine.

407
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,940
Your Highness came all the way to Nandu

408
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,340
but I failed to give you a proper welcome.

409
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,830
Please forgive my breach of etiquette.

410
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:38,350
When I got off the carriage, I recalled that

411
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,950
I used to travel around Nandu with my father when I was young.

412
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,260
I lived in this yard for a while.

413
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,770
It's like I'm returning home today.

414
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,230
You don't have to welcome me.

415
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:53,630
I didn’t expect that Your Highness and I share this experience. It's a kind of fate.

416
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,370
To be honest,

417
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,390
I came to Nandu this time because

418
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,000
firstly, no written statements were sent to the palace,

419
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:01,260
and secondly, no official documents were sent to the Imperial Security office,

420
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,980
even though we found out that the Nandu Prefecture Treasury had been burglarized.

421
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,330
So I came to investigate.

422
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:08,650
However, I heard about the water ghost robbery case on the way.

423
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,130
It's my duty to investigate.

424
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:11,540
I just want the truth.

425
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:15,990
This matter is creating a great deal of anxiety for me.

426
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:19,610
But, for this case,

427
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:21,560
I’m afraid it’ll inconvenience you.

428
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,530
What do you mean?

429
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:26,000
This case should be handled by the Nandu Government.

430
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,480
Since Lord Liu has no warrant,

431
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:30,290
according to the imperial court's laws and regulations,

432
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,580
you should follow my dispatch orders.

433
00:25:34,850 --> 00:25:35,480
Mr. Shao.

434
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,910
I heard an interesting story about you from my father.

435
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,440
I don't know if it's true.

436
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,260
Five years ago, when my father was traveling around Nandu,

437
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,120
it was you who hosted a banquet and showed hospitality.

438
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,540
That's true.

439
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,810
During this period, you two exchanged multiple toasts

440
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:50,850
and had a great conversation.

441
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:54,330
Not long after, you got really drunk.

442
00:25:55,150 --> 00:25:57,020
There's nothing wrong with getting drunk. It's very common.

443
00:25:57,850 --> 00:26:00,800
But do you know

444
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,030
what you said when you were drunk?

445
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:08,140
Uncle.

446
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,550
Do you want to write this down?

447
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:11,340
Write this down.

448
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,510
Mr. Shao talked about the laws of the Taizu Dynasty

449
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,360
from ancient to modern times.

450
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,350
He lamented that when an official was caught

451
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:21,010
for embezzling a mere 20 taels of silver,

452
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,170
he'll be punished by having his skin peeled and made into a bag, which is then filled with straw for public display.

453
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,820
That was too cruel.

454
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,410
I absolutely would not have dared to criticize Emperor Taizu.

455
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:32,170
What's interesting is that you said that

456
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,180
if those corrupt officials were born in the years of Tianqing,

457
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,390
you'd definitely have a way to make a fortune with them

458
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,770
without letting anyone find a single flaw.

459
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,660
Mr. Shao, what was your brilliant plan?

460
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:45,360
Tell us and enlighten the imperial guards.

461
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,540
That's absolutely not true.

462
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,020
I would never

463
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,060
have said such treacherous things.

464
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,200
No?

465
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,280
Then my father lied.

466
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:55,860
No, no, no.

467
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:57,680
This...

468
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,290
How could Prince Fu have lied?

469
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:05,530
Stop writing it down, please.

470
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,820
You shouldn't write about this.

471
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:08,530
Mr. Shao.

472
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,400
This is the duty of the Imperial Guard office.

473
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,480
You won't interfere, will you?

474
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,080
Mr. Shao, don't take it to heart.

475
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:17,630
Didn't Your Highness just say that

476
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,220
it's all just drunken talk?

477
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:19,670
Li Bo.

478
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:21,420
Did you write down everything that was just said?

479
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,340
Yes.

480
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,740
Then keep it and take good care of it.

481
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,510
Mr. Shao.

482
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,220
Let's talk about the investigation.

483
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,350
You're the great magistrate that governs Nandu.

484
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:34,880
You are ranked third.

485
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,460
I am just an idle commoner.

486
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,490
I'm an honorary fifth-rank imperial guard.

487
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,730
I'll be at your disposal for this investigation.

488
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:44,210
Mr. Shao, I'm looking forward to your guidance.

489
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,330
I'll need you to be fully in charge of the water ghost robbery case.

490
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,500
If you need my cooperation,

491
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,680
I'll give my all and do my best.

492
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:52,110
Okay.

493
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,310
I'll respectfully accept your offer then.

494
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,370
[Shao’s Residence]

495
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,350
Wait up, please stay.

496
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:58,980
Lord Liu.

497
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,200
Mr. Shao, this is inappropriate.

498
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:04,710
Won't we be inconveniencing you by occupying your residence?

499
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,820
It's nothing.

500
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,450
The inns outside

501
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,770
are not clean.

502
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,900
Only if Lord Liu and Your Highness stay here,

503
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,820
can I be at ease.

504
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,010
I'll respectfully accept your offer then.

505
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:20,670
Mr. Shao, I appreciate your kindness.

506
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:21,960
I won't see you off then.

507
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:23,780
Close the gate!

508
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:30,660
My lord.

509
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,160
How did this happen just after a drink?

510
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:44,410
My lord.

511
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,650
About that Liu Gongquan,

512
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,710
although he's a hanger-on of Prince Fu's family,

513
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,770
he is still the Emperor's man.

514
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:55,980
Did he bring Princess Mingzhu to Nandu this time

515
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:58,280
for Prince Fu's affairs

516
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,040
or the Emperor's?

517
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:00,990
How dare you!

518
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,020
Are you fit to ask about this?

519
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,060
Slap yourself.

520
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,700
I'm sorry.

521
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,550
I'm sorry.

522
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:10,970
Whether it's Prince Fu or the Emperor,

523
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,640
aren't they all the same?

524
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,880
Uncle, how was I?

525
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,230
I'm sure I don't have to pester you

526
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,300
to take me along with you the next time.

527
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,700
What's wrong with him?

528
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:28,900
He didn't even say thank you.

529
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:29,950
Your Highness, please forgive him.

530
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,200
If you work with him more, you'll know that

531
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,990
every time he asks about a case

532
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,160
and starts organizing his thoughts,

533
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:36,590
he's impenetrable

534
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:37,470
no matter who tries.

535
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,710
He has always been like this?

536
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:40,470
Yes.

537
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,310
Fine.

538
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:46,140
Sure enough, only people with quirks are worth being friends with.

539
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:12,690
Yun Xiang?

540
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:20,100
Why are you alone in Liansheng House?

541
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,860
Su Mingyu took Ke Menglan to inspect the tributary cloth.

542
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,460
Jin took Tianhu and the kids

543
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,100
to clean up the old house

544
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,240
so as to prepare for the charity hall's reopening.

545
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:40,170
Why have you never cared to ask about me?

546
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,590
What's wrong?

547
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:48,720
What should I ask about?

548
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:51,700
You never cared about where I go

549
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,350
or who I meet every day.

550
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,610
You must have your reasons for not telling me.

551
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,770
And I won't need to ask about what you want to say.

552
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,210
I understand.

553
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:11,080
I might have been a little troubled these days,

554
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:13,170
so I haven't been able to consider your feelings.

555
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:18,180
Don't be mad at me.

556
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,260
I'm not angry.

557
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:28,250
Why would I cause you more trouble at this time?

558
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,110
All right, let's get down to business.

559
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:35,730
About the silver robbery case,

560
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,140
at first,

561
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,630
I wanted to go look for the families of the towboat's official soldiers

562
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:45,080
to see if there are any signs of

563
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,470
premeditation.

564
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,190
Their families

565
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,140
should have already been detained by the government.

566
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:52,360
Not necessarily.

567
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:54,760
There are more than 30 official soldiers per boat.

568
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,350
There are at least hundreds of relatives.

569
00:31:58,250 --> 00:32:00,930
It's reasonable that a few had managed to escape.

570
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,190
Have you found any of them?

571
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:03,680
No.

572
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,000
I heard that an official soldier's younger brother

573
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,990
once went to jail for petty theft.

574
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,750
When he heard that the government wanted to arrest him again,

575
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,770
he got scared and went into hiding.

576
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:15,310
These petty thieves

577
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,870
usually hide in Zhushan Street

578
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,050
and sell silver secretly.

579
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,110
Although I haven't found him,

580
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,640
I've unintentionally learned about another piece of information.

581
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:23,650
What is it?

582
00:32:25,970 --> 00:32:28,600
This Silversmith Zhang was hired by Ye Xiao to melt silver.

583
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:31,040
[Zhushan Street, Silversmith House]

584
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:32,810
Thank you.

585
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:35,960
He's a good worker. Don't rush him.

586
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,670
Don't get rough with him too.

587
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,050
All right, go back to your room.

588
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,150
I'll be back after I'm done.

589
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,220
That masked man is called Yuan Ye.

590
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,620
He is Ye Xiao's trusted aide.

591
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,010
This clue

592
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,540
should be enough to help Yun Xiang start off his investigation.

593
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,170
I'm afraid he'll get suspicious of me.

594
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,120
I hope I can fool him once more.

595
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,120
I have to stay by his side for the next few days.

596
00:32:59,150 --> 00:32:59,670
You must not...

597
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,810
Don't worry.

598
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:03,880
I won't act rashly.

599
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,540
Those silversmiths in Zhushan Street,

600
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,710
that specially help petty thieves sell stolen goods and melt silver,

601
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,330
were all hired in one night.

602
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,030
Do you know where they were hired to?

603
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,350
I haven't found out about that yet.

604
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:27,510
This information that you brought is very important.

605
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,230
It proves that my previous guess is right.

606
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:32,920
Thank you.

607
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:39,330
It's also for my own good.

608
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,960
I feel uneasy seeing you worry.

609
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:53,920
You...

610
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,390
Close your eyes.

611
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,500
Why?

612
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:06,950
Be good.

613
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:17,219
I don't know what you're going to do,

614
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,880
but I just want to stay like this for a while.

615
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,470
I heard from Jin that

616
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,550
your hairpin was broken.

617
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,030
From now on,

618
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:14,860
wear this hairpin.

619
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:25,550
About the hairpin,

620
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,910
I just mentioned it to Jin in passing.

621
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:36,500
In the future, remember to tell me

622
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,730
about your past.

623
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,590
I want to know everything

624
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:43,980
that I wasn't a part of.

625
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,050
Yun Xiang.

626
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:34,660
What were you thinking about in that moment?

627
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,600
I wish everything would end soon.

628
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,340
I want to stay with you like this,

629
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,410
and ignore the commotion outside.

630
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,540
I feel the same.

631
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:12,920
They captured all of the silversmiths in Zhushan Street.

632
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,570
This proves my guess.

633
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,730
Transporting such a large amount of official silver

634
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:18,820
would be too conspicuous.

635
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:22,630
The best way would be to melt the silver again.

636
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,930
But the city gate is closed now,

637
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:25,850
and it's hard to get external assistance.

638
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:29,330
So they can only recruit silversmiths from the city.

639
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,030
But there is one thing

640
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,770
that will affect our further investigation.

641
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,500
What is it?

642
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,890
The Nandu government has issued a Market Closure Order

643
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,520
and dispatched soldiers to patrol throughout the day.

644
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,770
Naturally, the perpetrators wouldn't dare to act rashly.

645
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,430
But if they dare not take action,

646
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,290
we wouldn't be able to get more clues.

647
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,730
But even if they melt the silver ingots into small bits,

648
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,360
100,000 taels will still result in a huge bulk

649
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,980
and that's still hard to transport.

650
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,840
So I think they'll definitely split them up.

651
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,370
Through the bank?

652
00:38:03,730 --> 00:38:05,070
Of course the bank should be considered.

653
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:09,060
But they should have a better way out.

654
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:11,450
Tang's Gambling House?

655
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,000
That's right.

656
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,990
Qi Tianfeng also mentioned that

657
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:17,400
the Lingyuan Sect has been using Tang's Gambling House

658
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,280
for money laundering.

659
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:25,110
It seems that as long as the government lift the Market Closure Order,

660
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,950
we'll be able to anticipate their next moves.

661
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,600
But I think

662
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:32,450
there may be more challenging issues this time.

663
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,840
In the past, whether we were dealing with the Cao Sect

664
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,410
or Tang Xiao,

665
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,140
because the Su family was involved,

666
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,160
the government had never interfered.

667
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,060
But this time, while dealing with the Lingyuan Sect,

668
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,530
we'll also need to be prepared to deal with officials.

669
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:51,870
Yanan.

670
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:54,470
This silver robbery case

671
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,390
is definitely not as simple as a case of petty theft.

672
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,210
I don't want you to get too involved

673
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,940
and bring yourself trouble.

674
00:39:04,290 --> 00:39:06,730
Those people of the Lingyuan Sect are all outlaws.

675
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:08,760
I can't let you face them alone.

676
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,020
Yun Xiang.

677
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:12,700
I can help you.

678
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:15,480
Don't leave me out of this.

679
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:36,050
What are you planning to do

680
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,530
by turning all these new silver ingots into small bits?

681
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,110
Shut up if you want to live.

682
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,150
Stop talking.

683
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,090
Hey you, don't ask so much.

684
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,300
The sooner you finish your work, the sooner you can rest.
