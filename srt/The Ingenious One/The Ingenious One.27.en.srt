00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,220
you've had a great time

43
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,300
in Nandu.

44
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,620
When are you going back?

45
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,950
Not now. I haven't enjoyed myself to the full.

46
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,240
Besides,

47
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,320
even Father didn't urge me to go back to Yangzhou.

48
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,700
Prince Fu was ordered to meet His Majesty in Beidu.

49
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,640
I'm afraid he doesn't have time to care about you.

50
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:49,000
I don't care.

51
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,510
Since Father didn't urge me,

52
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,659
you should just leave me alone.

53
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,510
But your words make sense.

54
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:58,790
Since Father went to Beidu to meet with His Majesty,

55
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,170
I haven't heard from him.

56
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,340
I wonder if someone complained about him again.

57
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,650
I hope His Majesty wouldn't give him a hard time.

58
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,210
His Majesty is wise and benevolent.

00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,150

63
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:30,850

it's not Li Bo's fault.

147
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,250
It was my idea.

148

You're not allowed to go anywhere else tomorrow.

149
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,240
Just stay with the Princess in the courtyard.

150
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,220
Calm down.

151
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:00,930
Please don't be mad at me anymore.

Consider it a small gift to compensate you.

153

I really like your outfit today.

This is exactly as the saying goes, "Feminine charm concealing chivalry,

I hope all of this can end soon.

160
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,240
I want to stay with you like this forever

161
00:13:57,990 --> 00:13:59,320
and not care about the chaos outside.

162
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:19,690

164
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,160
Look at the dress.

165
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:25,720
Is it of top quality?

166
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,410
She only wore it once.

167
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:29,600
Why don't we give it to Tianhu?

168
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:30,700
That's right.

169
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,180
How could Tianhu wear other people's old clothes?

170
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,280
Throw these away.

171
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:41,340

173
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:54,370

By the way, Miss Ke,

177
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,740
her leaving is also beneficial to you.

178
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,420
The house you're living in down there is too small.

179
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,120
From now on, you'll move up here

180
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,420

181
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,510

and tell him to go to Guanghui Bank

187
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,130
and meet Mr. Mo tomorrow morning.

188
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:43,840
Mr. Mo,

189
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,890
why do you keep sighing today?

190
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,040
I've never seen you like this.

191
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,840
I've been keeping a low profile all my life.

192
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,930
That was the only secret I had,

193
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,100
but Yun Xiang revealed it all.

194
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,770
We need to verify the authenticity of the tributary cloth later.

195
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:56,520
It's better for me to do it.

196
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:01,860
Mr. Mo,

197
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,660
how did you find out the whereabouts of the tributary cloth?

198
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:06,780
Don't ask anything you shouldn't.

199
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:08,730
Rest assured.

200
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,900
I know what to

201
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,860
and what not to say later.

202
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:12,960
That's good.

203
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,680
If this matter is exposed,

204
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,900
not only will I be beheaded,

205
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:17,560
but your Su family will also suffer a lot.

206
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,040
Whom are we meeting with today?

207
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,230
Fine, I won't ask anymore.

208
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,830
Remember, don't talk as you wish.

209
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:47,710
Understood.

210
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,130
Please.

211
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:12,359
How many do you have?

212
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:13,720
I'll take them all.

213
00:17:14,130 --> 00:17:14,910
You didn't even inquire about the price.

214
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:16,650
I can afford it.

215
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:18,440
Come again tomorrow.

216
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,329
Wait.

217
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,250
I have to ask

218
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,490
where the goods came from.

219
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:26,880
According to the rules of our business,

220
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,530
we don't question the source of the goods.

221
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,570
I've known Guan for years.

222
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,270
Even if I ask a question, it's no big deal.

223
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,700
I'll ask you one last time.

224
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:37,650
Where did you get the goods?

225
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:43,070
No problem. I'll fulfil your wishes.

226
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,300
What kind of a fool

227
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,440
would be looking for trouble here?

228
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,980
Isn't this Mr. Mo?

229
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:08,960
Guan.

230
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,470
How have you been?

231
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:18,730
Come on.

232
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,300
Stop beating around the bush.

233
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,610
Do you really want the goods

234
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,440
or do you have other intentions?

235
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,990
Fine, I'll cut to the chase.

236
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:31,510
I do have another purpose.

237
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,700
I want to know who owns the goods

238
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:35,870
and where those people are.

239
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:37,860
Can you let me into the details?

240
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,680
I didn't want to take over the hot potato.

241
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
It's hard to get rid of it.

242
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,800
Only the royal members of the Japanese dare to accept it.

243
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,740
But you know how stingy those Japanese are.

244
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,850
But now that I think about it, it's a business without cost.

245
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,220
So I bit the bullet.

246
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,440
A business without cost?

247
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:57,220
That means someone used the goods

248
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,310
as a pledge.

249
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,860
Did they come over to you?

250
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,380
Mo,

251
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,190
don't force me to break the rules.

252
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,100
You may have outsmarted yourself.

253
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,940
I think Master Guan has

254
00:19:11,210 --> 00:19:12,530
only hundreds of bolts of tributary cloth.

255
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,660
If you agree to hand them over,

256
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,490
I promise to sell you

257
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:19,120
5,000 bolts at a low price in a year.

258
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:24,450
How arrogant you are!

259
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:26,800
You offered 5,000 bolts of tributary cloth without hesitation.

260
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,130
With that arrogance,

261
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,310
are you from the Su family in Nandu?

262
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,420
Judging from your age,

263
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,370
are you the second son of the Su family?

264
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:44,690
Great. You came at a good time.

265
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,700
Thank you for the gift, Mr. Mo.

266
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,000
I'll let my fellows down if I don't accept it.

267
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,540
Guan, listen.

268
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,720
Don't...

269
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,530
Master Guan.

270
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,580
How much do you want after kidnapping me?

271
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,720
Let me put it this way.

272
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,060
I'm not only the second son of the Su family

273
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,980
but also the chairman of the entire Nandu Chamber of Commerce.

274
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,620
It turns out that I'm more valuable than you thought.

275
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:11,550
Interesting.

276
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:13,710
I've never seen a hostage

277
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,710
raise the price for himself.

278
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,740
If you cooperate with me,

279
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,980
I'm sure I can double the profit

280
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,780
Mr. Mo promised you.

281
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,330
Okay, see you.

282
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,380
Come on. Let's go.

283
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,230
Mr. Mo, why didn't you tell me earlier that we were meeting the pirates?

284
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,340
We were just here to inquire.

285
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,780
I didn't expect you to be so impulsive.

286
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,800
Are you really going to work with Guan?

287
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,420
Let's get out of the gate alive first.

288
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:57,230
Besides, if they really want to cooperate with the Su family,

289
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:59,080
they must kidnap me again.

290
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,880
The pirates

291
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,780
have no future at all.

292
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,400
I don't mind giving them an empty promise.

293
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,320
You have indeed learned a lot from Yun Xiang.

294
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,350
You'll perform well as the chairman in the future.

295
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,220
A strong general does not lead weak soldiers.

296
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,460
An accomplished master has no unqualified disciples.

297
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:15,730
By the way, Mr. Mo,

298
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,070
do you know what's wrong with Yun recently?

299
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,890
What's wrong with him?

300
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,680
He seems to be mad at Miss Shu.

301
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,630
In the past, even if they had disputes,

302
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,670
they wouldn't be like this.

303
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,070
Miss Shu is acting weird too.

304
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:30,030
There's something behind everything she says lately.

305
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,720
It's like saying goodbye.

306
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,020
Saying goodbye?

307
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,760
Please help me ask him

308
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,320
to come to Guanghui Bank as soon as possible.

309
00:21:59,140 --> 00:21:59,790
Mr. Yun.

310
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,780
Mr. Yun.

311
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,900
I've prepared hangover soup for you.

312
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,250
Please get up and have some.

313
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,180
Hangover soup?

314
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,090
You should prepare wine for me to get sober.

315
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,790
Go and get it.

316
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,720
If you have something on your mind,

317
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,840
you can pour it out to me.

318
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:26,680
It's not a good idea to drown your sorrows in drinks.

319
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,940
I've been doing well lately.

320
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,880
I have no sorrows at all.

321
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,050
Leave it to me.

322
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,730
You're back so soon.

323
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,580
The wine is good, Yun.

324
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:16,840
Unfortunately,

325
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,660
it's a pity that you had such a wonderful time

326
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:21,920
but not a beautiful lady by your side.

327
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:25,970
Listen.

328
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:28,230
Jin has called Tianhu

329
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,380
to go to Jishan Hall.

330
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,650
Yet you are pestering Menglan every day.

331
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,570
Are you still going to operate Liansheng House?

332
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,880
Listen, I'm also one of the owners.

333
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,980
Go ahead and manage your business.

334
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:40,920
Leave me alone.

335
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,800
You're occupying my place.

336
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,060
Aren't you afraid that Miss Shu will return and get even with you?

337
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:50,550
Or she won't come back anymore?

338
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:58,140
Do you still remember what you said

339
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,400
when I was trapped in love?

340
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,420
Why are you so helpless

341
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,030
when it comes to yourself?

342
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,070
I'm different from you.

343
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:08,690
How?

344
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,410
Forget it.

345
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,100
Even you can't figure it out,

346
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,310
let alone me.

347
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,700
But you need to get up quickly.

348
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,510
Mr. Mo asked you to go there as soon as possible.

349
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:29,370
Have you found the tributary cloth?

350
00:24:31,050 --> 00:24:31,580
Yes.

351
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,610
The soldiers used the tributary cloth as a pledge

352
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,230
to become pirates under Master Guan.

353
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,570
But I've made a deal with them.

354
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,580
Master Guan promised to hand over the soldiers.

355
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:48,780
It tastes so bad. That's it.

356
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:55,980
Yun.

357
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,920
I won't ask about you and Miss Shu.

358
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:01,030
But when you want a drink, can you invite me?

359
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,280
I'm always at your disposal.

360
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,900
You won't tell me if I don't ask, will you?

361
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,290
How dare you hide it from me for so long?

362
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:27,120
Yun Xiang knows everything about me.

363
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:29,810
He's already obsessed with Shu Yanan.

364
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,860
Who knows what he told her?

365
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,160
Since you're sure

366
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,190
she's from the Lingyuan Sect,

367
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,740
how could you let her go?

368
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:42,110
Uncle, I...

369
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:44,590
I begged Kang

370
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,320
to hide it for me.

371
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,810
You have been drinking my wine since you came.

372
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,130
Say something.

373
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,920
How much did you tell her?

374
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:22,330
I told her everything I could

375
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,450
and couldn't say.

376
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,790
Look at you.

377
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,960
You are reluctant for her to leave.

378
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,450
You joined the Yuntai Sect in your teens

379
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,740
and studied in the mountains for 15 years.

380
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,190
But you still fell for beauties after leaving the mountain.

381
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:51,070
However, it's not your fault.

382
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,190
I yearn so much...

383
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,980
To tie her back and be with her forever.

384
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:00,840
Forget it.

385
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,590
Love is ruthless.

386
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:04,840
You are that calculative,

387
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,550
but you didn't expect you couldn't get over the unattainable love.

388
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,670
Anyway,

389
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,280
if that girl really works for Lingyuan,

390
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:17,230
then the one stopping you two

391
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:20,150
will be the hundred-year grudge between Lingyuan and Yuntai.

392
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,660
I know.

393
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:33,740
I don't hate her for being a member of the Lingyuan Sect.

394
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,690
So what if she lied to me?

395
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,040
Even if she ends up killing me,

396
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:54,660
it's better than

397
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:58,370
leaving without saying goodbye.

398
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,180
It's fine that you tell me that.

399
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,310
But you should keep her in your heart only, from now on.

400
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,790
There are some words

401
00:28:23,590 --> 00:28:24,840
I only dare to say to you.

402
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,020
It's somehow hilarious.

403
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,190
If you hadn't been that conscientious,

404
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,830
I wouldn't have been so close to you.

405
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,410
Forget it. Let's change our thinking.

406
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:39,880
You asked me to...

407
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,300
You asked me to help you locate

408
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,480
the whereabouts of the soldiers on the towboat.

409
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,160
What are you planning?

410
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,020
The Tang family's property

411
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,160
is already in your pocket.

412
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,640
Really?

413
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,810
[Lingyuan, Kou Lianyi]

414
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:31,860
Where is Bi Yuewu?

415
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,980
I'm asking why you are here alone.

416
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,000
Where is Bi Yuewu?

417
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:40,800
My dear sister.

418
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,830
Are you surprised that I managed to escape?

419
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:45,890
What?

420
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,860
The moment you left,

421
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,030
we were surrounded by the shadowmen.

422
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,700
More soldiers came in less than an hour.

423
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,100
Can you tell now?

424
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:56,430
Yun Xiang has never trusted you.

425
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,710
I wonder how many times

426
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,610
he used you all this time.

427
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,230
Didn't Bi Yuewu manage to escape?

428
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,080
If she hadn't distracted the pursuers,

429
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,090
I wouldn't have escaped so easily.

430
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
Immediately cross the river and report this to Mother.

431
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,640
I'll go back to the city to gather the information.

432
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,800
Maybe I can save her.

433
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:15,930
No need.

434
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,440
She must have already died.

435
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:21,180
She made a lot of contributions to our sect.

436
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,110
Are you going to leave her in danger?

437
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,200
Her life was used to redeem mine.

438
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,900
She has served her proper purpose.

439
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:29,930
There's no need for you to take another risk.

440
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,470
She has been with you for seven years.

441
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,920
That's right. I've got tired of her.

442
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,720
Bi Yuewu was in trouble because of you.

443
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,050
If we weren't related by blood,

444
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:42,510
I wouldn't stop you.

445
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,600
Go if you want to sign your own death warrant.

446
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:45,990
No one cares about you.

447
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,330
Yuanjie,

448
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,740
when did you become so heartless?

449
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,180
If you are that soft-hearted,

450
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:55,170
how can you be the master of the sect?

451
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:06,560
Let's go.

452
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,980
We can't stay in Nandu anymore.

453
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,600
Mother will also blame me when we go back.

454
00:31:25,030 --> 00:31:25,460
Set sail.

455
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:30,830
Set sail!

456
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,640
Mr. Nangong.

457
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,350
Young Master Kou.

458
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,460
Lady Kou.

459
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,680
Why aren't you eating?

460
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:56,700
Mother,

461
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,460
are you angry?

462
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,780
What rights do I have to be so?

463
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:06,120
I am already on tenterhooks

464
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,460
to have dinner with the three of you.

465
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,420
How dare I be angry?

466
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:12,890
Madam Kou,

467
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:15,730
we can't afford that.

468
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,510
You're too modest.

469
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,430
I'm honoured

470
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,750
to have dinner with you.

471
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,830
Did you send Yuan Ye,

472
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,460
who was under Ye Xiao, to me?

473
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:38,220
Madam Kou,

474
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,470
since he had my token,

475
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:43,000
of course, he was ordered by me.

476
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:45,650
Talk nicely.

477
00:33:58,730 --> 00:34:00,740
Yuan Ye told me a story

478
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,180
that happened in Nandu.

479
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:05,290
I couldn't tell if it was true.

480
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,330
So I could only ask you to make the final call.

481
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:11,179
Yes, he told me

482
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:14,190
my useless children

483
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:17,370
got the Yuntai Sect and the government

484
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,530
to kill Mr. Ye.

485
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:25,190
It's ridiculous if they harmed our people using other forces.

486
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,739
Maybe he was so eager to protect his master

487
00:34:29,969 --> 00:34:30,810
that he talked that nonsense.

488
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,469
I've already executed him.

489
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:39,520
Madam Kou is indeed wise.

490
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:45,190
One threw herself at someone from the Yuntai Sect,

491
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:49,889
and the other was keen to do the dirty business.

492
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,810
How about you kill me first

493
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:55,860
and fight for the position of master?

494
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,360
What do you think?

495
00:34:59,770 --> 00:35:01,210
Mother, we are aware of our mistakes.

496
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,260
Call me Madam Kou.

497
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,550
Yes, Madam Kou.

498
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,340
I am too incompetent

499
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,570
to discipline you two,

500
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,530
that's why you caused the trouble.

501
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,750
Mr. Nangong,

502
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:31,740
do you know how to punish them?

503
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,890
Madam Kou, this is your family matter.

504
00:35:35,410 --> 00:35:37,840
I shouldn't intervene in it.

505
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:42,670
I'm asking you about how to deal with them.

506
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,480
In my opinion,

507
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,170
Lady Kou approached the Yuntai's disciple

508
00:35:53,530 --> 00:35:54,780
to learn more about the enemy.

509
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:57,220
There's no point in punishing her.

510
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,080
Young Master Kou stole official silver

511
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,020
for the benefit of our sect.

512
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,270
It's just that he didn't plan well.

513
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:06,100
Enough with your false display of affection.

514
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:06,820
How dare you!

515
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:07,640
Mother.

516
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,420
Madam Kou.

517
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,430
I am aware that revolution

518
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,750
will surely arouse the fellows' resentment.

519
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:17,100
It's just a matter of time.

520
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:20,140
Although the situation in Nandu City is still unclear,

521
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,620
the Yangzhou merchants

522
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,030
are already under Lingyuan's control.

523
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,350
How about I transfer my business to Young Master Kou

524
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,980
so that I can have a carefree life?

525
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,160
Don't speak with sarcasm.

526
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,720
-I don't care about your money.
-Yuanjie.

527
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:33,770
Mother.

528
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:49,360
From now on,

529
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,290
you are not allowed to use the Young Master's seal.

530
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,630
Return to Jiangbei immediately.

531
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,500
You can't cross the river without my order.

532
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,200
All of you, leave.

533
00:37:00,950 --> 00:37:01,630
Yes, madam.

534
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,110
Lianyi, stay here.

535
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,650
Do you still remember your last name

536
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:30,690
and whose daughter you are?

537
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,950
I dare not forget it, not even a day.

538
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,470
Since you haven't forgotten,

539
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:36,570
why did you leave home and go to the South?

540
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:39,180
You even swore that

541
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,960
you could find a good way to deal with Nangong Fang.

542
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:46,980
Is the current situation what you want?

543
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,540
You both think I'm an old fool

544
00:37:52,550 --> 00:37:54,590
who didn't notice Nangong Fang's ulterior motive.

545
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,260
Are you cold?

546
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,140
No.

547
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:03,990
It's cold by the water.

548
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:05,670
Mother, it's okay.

549
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:07,780
Listen to me.

550
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,700
I'm afraid you'll catch a cold.

551
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:14,450
I will protect you both no matter how old I am.

552
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,810
I always turn a blind eye

553
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:25,130
to Nangong Fang

554
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,530
and let him do what he wants

555
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,100
and outshine the others.

556
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,970
Do you know why?

557
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:33,220
You have no choice.

558
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:36,530
Elaborate it.

559
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,250
A sturdy tree will be cut down, a strong army will be annihilated.

560
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,340
In order to restore the throne,

561
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,640
Lingyuan fought for almost a century.

562
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,040
I'm afraid before you became the master...

563
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,490
Go ahead.

564
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,760
The sect had almost been doomed.

565
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:56,980
If you didn't accommodate to circumstances,

566
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:59,100
I'm afraid we wouldn't have been able to survive till today.

567
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,820
Not to mention standing above all in Jiangbei

568
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,300
and fighting with Jiangnan.

569
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,220
Who do you think contributed to this?

570
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,730
Mother is good at discerning people and using people.

571
00:39:12,860 --> 00:39:16,180
But Nangong Fang did contribute a lot.

572
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:17,400
In this case,

573
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,070
you can only watch Nangong Fang

574
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,860
expand his territory every day

575
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:23,290
until it's hard to control.

576
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:26,930
Now the power of Jiangnan seems to be under the Lingyuan Sect,

577
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,730
but he's already in control of it.

578
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,040
That's one of the reasons.

579
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:40,420
Second, the mountains of Lingyuan are all over the country.

580
00:39:40,950 --> 00:39:43,280
Every mountain needs money and food.

581
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,540
Without him,

582
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:47,870
who would support the food and accommodation of over 10,000 people?

583
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,580
He said he wanted to hand over

584
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:54,010
the business in Jiangnan to Yuanjie.

585
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,840
If you were him, would you dare?

586
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,420
What should we do?

587
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,710
Whoever controls Jiangnan

588
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:12,240
is working for Lingyuan.

589
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,890
As long as he can be of use to Ling Yuan,

590
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,240
there is no harm in using him.

591
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,200
I was right about you.

592
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:23,150
You should know that Lingyuan doesn't belong to the Kou family.

593
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,680
If one day I'm gone,

594
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:28,040
and you have no means of suppressing him,

595
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,180
he will not spare your lives.

596
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:39,840
Yuanjie is brave and smart

597
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,960
but too arrogant.

598
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:46,410
On the contrary, you are gifted

599
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,190
and meticulous.

600
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,900
You must assist Yuanjie in the future.

601
00:40:53,010 --> 00:40:55,160
If Yuanjie takes over the position of master,

602
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:57,630
you have to take over the position of Nangong Fang.

603
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,160
If so,

604
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,600
I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

605
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,140
Why?

606
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:07,110
Nangong Fang has different means from Lingyuan,

607
00:41:07,450 --> 00:41:08,250
but the same as Yuntai's.

608
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:09,740
I'd been observing

609
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:12,090
the people of Yuntai in Nandu

610
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,300
about how they plan and set up.

611
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,620
But I was always slow in understanding.

612
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,250
I couldn't figure out

613
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,260
or learn their essence.

614
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:21,460
There's no need to learn from Yun Xiang.

615
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,860
I want you to follow Nangong Fang back to Nandu

616
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,160
and see how he can deal with the people of Yuntai.

617
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,750
Have you forgotten

618
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,100
why I left home and went south back then?

619
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,290
The engagement has been broken off.

620
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:35,260
I want you to keep an eye on him

621
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:37,540
and learn from him by his side.

622
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:40,130
That way, you can deal with him one day.

623
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,550
But Nangong Fang

624
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,800
will see through you.

625
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,090
If I give him the order,

626
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,620
he won't dare decline.

627
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:49,900
I'm old now.

628
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:53,190
There's not much I can do for you.

629
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:55,180
Don't let me down.
