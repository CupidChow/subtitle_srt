00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:16,940
are the eyes.

192
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,290
And the pufferfish's eyes

193
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,730
are precisely the most poisonous part.

194
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,050
So we must be careful to remove them completely.

195
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,950
Your Master, are you referring to...

196
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,800
Wen Cong?

197
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,410
Try it.

198
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:45,180
Right now, you have to run away quickly

199
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,680
and settle down safely.

200
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:51,680
Senior.

201
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,870
Do you remember Shu Yanan?

202
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:58,420
My lord.

203
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,390
Have you found the girl?

204
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,580
By the west wharf,

205
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,190
wild dogs have dug up many corpses.

206
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,250
It's Li and the others.

207
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,820
Follow me.

208
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:10,750
Yes.

209
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:28,760
Wen Cong.

210
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,550
My people were killed for no reason.

211
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,510
Did you deliver the news outwards

212
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,830
such that your disciples came to me?

213
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:37,530
I'm imprisoned in this dungeon.

214
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,620
How can I deliver the message?

215
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,230
Stop playing tricks.

216
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,540
Qi Tianfeng only told me to keep an eye on you,

217
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,680
but he didn't tell me to keep you alive.

218
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,310
Lord Yan!

219
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,510
My lord.

220
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:53,380
Speak!

221
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,080
All of your secret accounts

222
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,230
were pasted at the entrance of the Yangzhou prefecture.

223
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:02,780
Tell me!

224
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,490
Was it you?

225
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,210
Lord Yan.

226
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,850
You two colluded

227
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:13,590
and embezzled the government's salt.

228
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,480
Once this news spreads,

229
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,730
you know what the consequences will be like.

230
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,270
If you offend Qi Tianfeng,

231
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:24,880
you still have places to hide.

232
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,570
But if you offend Yuntai Sect,

233
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,440
there will be no place for you

234
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:33,580
in this world anymore.

235
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:36,430
Let's go.

236
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:37,700
Go!

237
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,350
Lock the door well.

238
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:42,870
Yes.

239
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:45,960
My lord,

240
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,110
we can't stay in Baiju Town.

241
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,340
Hurry and pack your things.

242
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,300
Okay.

243
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,080
[Zhang Kui, Cao Sect]

244
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,750
Zhang Kui, what's the meaning of this?

245
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,640
Lord Yan,

246
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,150
Master Qi has set up a tomb for you.

247
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,630
I’ll personally send you in.

248
00:16:24,710 --> 00:16:25,510
Lord Yan,

249
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:28,020
the sooner you die, the sooner you'll be reincarnated.

250
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,210
Stop chasing.

251
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:55,970
The most important thing now is to destroy the salt farm's official accounts.

252
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:56,710
Go.

253
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,540
Light the fire while the wind is blowing.

254
00:16:58,900 --> 00:16:59,610
Light the fire in more spots,

255
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,560
so we don't raise suspicions about how only the accounting office caught fire.

256
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,040
Yes.

257
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,330
Yes.

258
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,460
Make it quick!

259
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,040
Go report to the government yourself.

260
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,220
I want you to pay

261
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:56,430
for Godfather's suffering bit by bit.

262
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:11,690
You asked for your death.

263
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,420
Fire! Run!

264
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,230
Hurry!

265
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,640
Fire!

266
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,440
Did you set the fire?

267
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:16,410
Yes...

268
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,060
or no.

269
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,070
You disclosed Yan Luowang’s salt trafficking

270
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,140
and made him panic.

271
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,690
If he wants to completely destroy the evidence,

272
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,920
he needs to destroy the official accounts.

273
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,940
Soon, the fire will spread with the sea breeze.

274
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,550
Baiju Town will be in chaos.

275
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,620
This is our chance to escape.

276
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:39,310
You've indeed learned your deduction skills from our Sect's teachings.

277
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:41,420
But in order to save me,

278
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:43,870
you've put Baiju Town's people in calamity.

279
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,090
Is this the way of Yuntai Sect?

280
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,590
If we don't get rid of Yan Luowang,

281
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,310
how can the salt workers and salt businesses make a comeback?

282
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,670
I just hope this big fire

283
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,060
can burn down the injustice of the past.

284
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,690
Only in this way can the whole Baiju Town

285
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:57,510
have a chance to start anew.

286
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:02,200
The members of Yuntai Sect

287
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:04,940
win and stay upright

288
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,420
with wisdom.

289
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,070
Although you've broken both your legs,

290
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:12,600
you can still despise me.

291
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,420
I've been waiting for 15 years

292
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:16,700
just for today.

293
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,670
You've learned for 15 years.

294
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,460
How much have you had figured out?

295
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,200
Senior, what exactly happened in Luo Family's village that year?

296
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,040
I was the one who ordered Qi Tianfeng to bribe the soldiers.

297
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,400
They entered the Luo Family's village in the name of investigating pirates

298
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,680
and forced the farmers to hand over their land.

299
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:33,230
However, I didn't expect the soldiers to slaughter

300
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,390
and massacre the entire village.

301
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,760
When I arrived,

302
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:37,630
I only had time to save you.

303
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,550
The soldiers massacred my family's village.

304
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,180
Who else is behind this?

305
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,820
The truth you've been waiting for 15 years

306
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,790
turned out to be worse than you imagined.

307
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:51,760
Enmity is of the mortal heart.

308
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:53,980
A mortal heart cannot master the way of Yuntai Sect.

309
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:56,930
Yun Xiang, are you still unable to let it go?

310
00:20:57,470 --> 00:20:59,200
Do you still want to investigate the case?

311
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,170
My surname is Luo.

312
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,300
My name is Luo Wenjia.

313
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,740
You are extremely talented.

314
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,970
If you can let go of the past—

315
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:32,980
Put me down and run!

316
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:33,630
Mr. Wen.

317
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:34,930
Don't bother about me.

318
00:22:35,990 --> 00:22:37,120
Run!

319
00:22:58,590 --> 00:22:59,580
Yanan...

320
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,630
Take care of her.

321
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:12,530
Mr. Wen!

322
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:07,390
What did Godfather say before he died?

323
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:09,920
He said nothing.

324
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,530
Godfather, I'm sorry I couldn't fulfill my filial duties.

325
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,440
I was late.

326
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,230
As gratitude for raising me,

327
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:23,910
I swear I'll repay you with the blood of your enemy.

328
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:30,440
An eye for an eye.

329
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,900
New and old hatred...

330
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,460
when will they end?

331
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,260
If you were young and homeless,

332
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,620
and had to face the tragic death of your benefactor

333
00:24:48,710 --> 00:24:49,810
who was also like family,

334
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,310
your hatred would be greater than mine.

335
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,300
Don’t be too sad.

336
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,710
If Mr. Wen was alive,

337
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,230
he wouldn’t want to see you like this.

338
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:41,330
The fire has burnt out and only ashes are left.

339
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,180
It seems like only ashes are left,

340
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:49,780
but they're actually marking another beginning.

341
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:55,630
The entire area along the river

342
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:58,440
is now under Qi Tianfeng's control.

343
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,800
Have you thought about what to do next?

344
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:03,680
Not yet.

345
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,100
Speaking of which, it's absurd,

346
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:10,200
that I know nothing about you.

347
00:26:13,330 --> 00:26:14,910
Actually, there's also a deep grudge...

348
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,310
I've to settle between Qi Tianfeng and me.

349
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,420
How about this?

350
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,010
Why don't you join hands with me?

351
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,340
Think about it.

352
00:26:20,950 --> 00:26:23,310
If you are alone,

353
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:24,700
your power is limited.

354
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,290
If we work together,

355
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:29,420
with my wisdom and your martial arts skills,

356
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,350
we make up for each other's shortcomings, like a perfect match.

357
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,510
Why do I feel like you've planned this beforehand?

358
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,050
Sort of.

359
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,010
Let's go.

360
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,480
Where are we going?

361
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:46,470
Yangzhou.

362
00:26:48,550 --> 00:26:50,490
Yangzhou is the biggest commercial port north of Yangtze River.

363
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:52,510
There are Cao Sect's spies everywhere.

364
00:26:53,670 --> 00:26:54,230
Let's go.

365
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:02,320
[Drunken Willow Inn]

366
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,110
Warrior Jin.

367
00:27:12,150 --> 00:27:13,790
It's the same price as an Armed Escort's life.

368
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:16,430
Ten taels of gold per life.

369
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,230
No problem.

370
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,840
I want him killed even if I have to borrow money.

371
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:19,990
I wasn't home for months

372
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,460
and that shrew actually fell in love with the neighboring village's butcher.

373
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,700
I offer 20 taels.

374
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,090
Please help me kill these adulterers.

375
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,760
I don't kill women and children.

376
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,930
If she's with the butcher now,

377
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,720
why can't you just marry another woman?

378
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:32,300
This...

379
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,250
Jin Biao.

380
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,340
There's a reckless kid in the West Village

381
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,170
who is recklessly targeting the County Magistrate

382
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:43,770
for owing some workers' wages.

383
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,110
The County Magistrate wants to invite you over.

384
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,240
As long as no one finds out,

385
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,220
we can negotiate the price.

[Swordsman, "Ten Taels of Gold"]

387
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:55,640
What a corrupt official.

388
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,460
He doesn't want to pay wages,

389
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:00,010
but is willing to pay to have someone killed.

390
00:28:00,230 --> 00:28:00,750
Get lost.

391
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,370
Sorry, Warrior Jin.

392
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:02,950
Goodbye.

393
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:05,640
Jin Biao, "Ten Taels of Gold".

394
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:10,150
Twenty taels for him dead.

395
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,680
Let me have a look at him.

396
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,110
I can't accept this deal.

397
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,820
If it's too low,

398
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,470
just name the price.

399
00:28:24,070 --> 00:28:24,870
You're too late.

400
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,140
He just hired me.

401
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,010
I need to do something.

402
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,050
Thirty taels.

403
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,050
Forty taels.

404
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:36,850
Fifty taels?

405
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,910
How many times do I have to tell you?

406
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,310

407
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,790
Don't overestimate yourself.

My business is priced at 10 taels of gold per life.

409

Do you know what it's based on?

410
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,770
First, I keep my promise.

411
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,060
Second...

412
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,250
I'm quick.

413
00:29:19,990 --> 00:29:20,950
Two lives.

414
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,130
Twenty taels.

415
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,510
You tried so hard to save Godfather.

416
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:47,680
Yet you're not at all sad

417
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,810
over his death.

418
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:53,380
Why cry over spilt milk?

419
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:55,870
By the way,

420
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:57,750
how much do you know

421
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,270
about Qi Tianfeng?

422
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:03,180
I only know that he's from Cao Sect.

423
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,790
He used to be a wharf laborer,

424
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,700
but he was ruthless and decisive.

425
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:10,410
Back then, Godfather broke into the commerce world of Nandu

426
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,110
and caused a stir among the local forces.

427
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,140
He needed someone to appear in public for him

428
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:15,740
and chose Qi Tianfeng.

429
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:16,930
In return,

430
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,690
Godfather helped him secure the position

431
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:20,020
of the Sect leader of Cao Sect.

432
00:30:20,630 --> 00:30:21,270
Have you seen him before?

433
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,580
A long time ago.

434
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,170
He looks weak,

435
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:28,900
but he's actually a martial arts expert in Nandu City.

436
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:32,620
And he went straight up to a prestigious official position from such a humble one.

437
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,510
It's unfathomable how scheming he is.

438
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:39,510
Qi Tianfeng and Mr. Wen were so close.

439
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:41,620
As his goddaughter,

440
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:43,370
you should have seen him often.

441
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,540
If I had known Cao Sect was after you,

442
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,490
I would have asked for more than 10 taels.

443
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,460
Did they look for you?

444
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,240
He offered

445
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,020
20 taels of gold.

446
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,520
Do you think I accepted it?

447
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,500
From what you've just said, I don't think

448
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,980
you have the intention to kill me.

449
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,170
Of course.

450
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,550
There are rules in my industry.

451
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,160
But they kept insisting me to do it.

452
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,230
So I warned them

453
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,360
by killing two of them.

454
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:37,630
Do you want more money?

455
00:31:37,910 --> 00:31:39,470
I like you, so I'll give you a 50% discount.

456
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,080
Please spare your effort.

457
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:47,860
If you kill all your way to Nandu,

458
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:49,770
I'll go bankrupt.

459
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:58,610
Miss, you said your back hurt just now.

460
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:12,390
Look at you.

461
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,650
You want to cross the river yet you offended Cao Sect.

462
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,660
This river belongs to them.

463
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:19,070
I reckon you already had a plan.

464
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:19,800
Speak up.

465
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:23,250
Miss, are you familiar with Yangzhou?

466
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,430
In terms of prosperity along the river,

467
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,430
Nandu comes in first and Yangzhou comes in second.

468
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:30,860
The two cities divide the country into the South and the North.

469
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:31,640
Facing each other from afar,

470
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,620
both are hubs frequented by groups of traveling merchants.

471
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,960
You crossed the river from Yangzhou

472
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,220
because you want to set up a group of traveling merchants,

473
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,940
so it'll be harder for the opponents

474
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:43,600
to attack you in public.

475
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,180
The biggest raw silk market in Yangzhou is ahead,

476
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,030
filled with groups of traveling merchants from Nandu.

477
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:57,030

It won't hurt to check out a few more.

They are all raw silk from Yangzhou.

I don't think there will be any difference.

500

In business, it's better to

501
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:04,470
be more meticulous.

We have a friendly relationship with these silk merchants.

505
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,110

There's no need to nitpick.

00:34:15,389 --> 00:34:16,290
this isn't the martial world,

My sister said

511
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,340
I have the say on this silk purchase.

512
00:34:22,870 --> 00:34:24,860
It is said that the Young Master of the Su family is chivalrous and brave.

513
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,179
It’s an honor to meet you today.

514
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,000
I really admire you.

515
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:29,360
Since Mr. Su is so chivalrous,

516
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:31,230
I'll sell my 500 catties of fine raw silk

517

Thank you, then.

Young Master.

521
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,100
Purchasing 500 catties at a time

522
00:34:39,810 --> 00:34:41,150
is not in accordance with Su family's rules.

523
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,199
Rules are set by people.

00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,650
In the future, if I were to take the helm

525
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,940
and change all the rules—

526
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,120
If this deal is done,

527
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,770
you'll not only break the rules,

528
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,440
but also lose the favor of the people.

529
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,989
Who are you? And why do you say that?

530
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:58,990
Mr. Su.

531
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:02,050
You accept medium-quality silk at the price of high-quality silk.

532
00:35:02,530 --> 00:35:03,860
This goes against the rules of commerce.

533
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,230
Readily believing those smooth talkers

534
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,300
will only disappoint the meticulous silk merchants.

535
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:12,180
The natural way of commerce is to retain by fair means what was acquired by foul.

536
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,190
No matter how big your family or business is,

537
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:15,720
if your words and actions are this rash,

538
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,770
I’m afraid your reputation as the royal supplier won’t last much longer.

539
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,450
My family is the century-old royal supplier of silk.

540

Who are you to interfere?

542
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:27,800
In that case,

543
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:29,960
you must have done that intentionally.

544
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:37,930
I was too impatient just now.

545
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,450

00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,430
we just agreed...

549
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,620
Do you still want to do business with the Su family in the future?

550
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:48,550
Okay then. Mr. Su, take your time to look around.

00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,030

You seem extraordinary and proficient in commerce.

00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,540
on my way to Nandu.

559
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:05,830
You're going to Nandu?

560
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,320
That's great, you should come with us.

561
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,230
Let's go together.

562
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:19,950
I'm sorry.

563
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:22,870
Sure.

564
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:24,470
I happen to have two friends with me.

565
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,340
Can they join us too?

566
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,150
Since they're your friends, of course.

567
00:36:44,430 --> 00:36:45,630
This journey is boring.

568
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:47,670
I haven't even seen a thief.

569
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,230
It's good to have a safe journey.

570
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,920
We are businessmen,

571
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:52,660
not people of the martial world.

572
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,470
You are the only son of the Su family.

573
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,130
You’ve to take over the family business sooner or later.

574
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:59,130
It’s good to know more about the raw silk industry

575
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,350
prior.

576
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,830
It's more practical than looking for

577
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,570
those martial arts books.

578
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:05,180
I know, Qian.

579
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,900
What's your relationship with Cao Sect?

580
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,830
I have a grudge against Qi Tianfeng for exterminating my family.

581
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,250
More than 10 years ago,

582
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:39,460
Shu family's Armed Escort Agency took a business deal.

583
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,500
The Armed Escort's capital was a whopping 300 taels of gold.

584
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,680
Naturally, the security deposit was also high.

585
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:47,840
[More than 10 years ago]

586
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:47,290
If anything went wrong,

587
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:49,710
Shu's Chief Armed Escort would go bankrupt.

588
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,240
In the end, he ran into pirates.

589
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,920
[Shu's Ancestral Hall]

590
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,090
Three generations of Shu family's property was destroyed in one go.

591
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,790
My father committed suicide in resentment.

592
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,770
Qi Tianfeng was the one who offered this business deal.

593
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:09,220
I see.

594
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,120
In just this one round,

595
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:12,850
Qi Tianfeng usurped all of Shu family's property.

596
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,860
I'm guessing he must have already been in contact

597
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:15,810
with those pirates beforehand.

598
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,310
After my father died,

599
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:20,700
Qi Tianfeng wanted to get rid of every member of the Shu family

600
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,740
to eliminate all future troubles.

601
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,240
It was Mr. Wen who saved me

602
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,450
and took me in as his goddaughter.

603
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:29,380
After I became an adult, I traveled around and practiced martial arts.

604
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:32,380
I only found out Godfather was in trouble when I returned to Nandu half a month ago.

605
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:35,710
But it was still too late.

606
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,570
No wonder you said you haven't seen Qi Tianfeng in a long time.

607
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:41,570
With his power today,

608
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,220
he must be much stronger than before.

609
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:44,830
How sure are you that you can take him down?

610
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,640
Let's just go to Nandu first.
