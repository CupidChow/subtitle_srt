Step back.

86
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,300
Are you bluffing?

87
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,280

but let the master behind you show up.

105
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,540

109

Are you exhaust internal strength?

110
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,280
He doesn't have any internal strength,

111
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,490
he's terrified.

112
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,850
Let's go find him. That's right

113
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:03,690
It's so expensive.

114
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,820
Tell us.

115
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,760
One tael of silver could buy

116
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,220
four catties first-class silk before.

117
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:08,980
Yeah.

118
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,820
Now, we have to pay one and a half taels of silver for one catty.

119
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,100
How many times have you doubled it?

120
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,490
Right, right? right!

121
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,100

122
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:18,980
I'm sorry.

123
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:19,690
If you think it's too expensive,

124
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,530
please go somewhere else to take a chance.

125
00:15:22,180 --> 00:15:23,510
How could you say that?

126
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,580
You are losing sight of clients!

127
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:27,580
Yes, indeed!

128
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,580
Excuse me.

One and a half taels of silver for one catty.

130
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,390
Boss,

131
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,380
please give me fifty catties.

132
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,340
Got it, wait a moment, please.

133
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:41,410
Buying it at such a price is so...

134
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,140
How could you let him raise the price?

135
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,340
There was a fire in Yufeng warehouse

136
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,490
and burned half amount of raw silk in Nandu City.

137
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,330
There's some silk, why not buy them?

138
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,430
Indeed.

139
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,200
Boss, give me fifty catties.

140
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,470
Me too. Me too.

141
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:10,560
Mr Ding.

142
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:17,740
Now all we need is to wait for other merchants to come.

143
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:18,960
Before the market is closed today,

144
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,820
double the silk price.

145
00:16:21,810 --> 00:16:22,210
Understood.

146
00:16:25,070 --> 00:16:27,560
You're intelligent and good at business.

147
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,170
You sold 30% amount of land to me

148
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:32,040
and charged me 15,000 taels of silver.

149
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:38,770
What are you looking at?  Afraid of getting short measure?

150
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,010
Don't worry.

151
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,600
I can't be bothered to do something as petty as this.

152
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:50,900
You could have sent someone

153
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,500
for the 15,000 taels of silver.

154
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,120
Why did you come here yourself?

155
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,000
There must be something else.

156
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:01,900
Yes.

157
00:17:04,339 --> 00:17:05,960
I have something to ask.

158
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:10,220
Wen Cong's adopted daughter is Shu Yanan.

159
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,640
I think you already knew it.

160
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:16,930
Are your two masters

161
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:18,849
no match for that girl?

162
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,579
She's nothing.

163
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:25,560
But you didn't mention that Yun Xiang is an extraordinary master.

164
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,300
What do you mean? Think I'm a joke?

165
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,740
Yun Xiang.

166
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,070
It seems that

167
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,200
your cheating trick that was claimed to be invincible

168
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,840
met a match.

169
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,560
Cheating trick?

170
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,360
How is that cheating trick?

171
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:48,980
I can see that he's skilled

172
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:49,880
and experienced.

173
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,650
He's not an ordinary master.

174
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:52,360
Yes.

175
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,380
My men fought him before.

176
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,730
Although he's skilled,

177
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,940
I heard that he only defended but didn't attack.

178
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,150
Really?

179
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,700
And he didn't want to fight but ended it quickly.

180
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:05,900
Is that so?

181
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:07,350
Yes.

182
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:08,820
What do you mean?

183
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,450
He doesn't know how to fight.

184
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,300
Mr Qi,

185
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:25,550

Don't waste it.

00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:01,910
♫We must watch the fire♫

193
00:19:01,930 --> 00:19:05,010
♫The horse goes deep into the mountain and disappears♫

194
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:10,980
♫Spring and the rain are in our hearts♫

195
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:17,110
♫Lock our hearts♫

196
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:20,340
♫There're wrinkles on my forehead♫

197
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,640
♫I was so anxious♫

198
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,880
♫I was afraid the wind would blow away my fate♫

199

♫Don't allow anyone to ask♫

203
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,670
Are you wondering why did you lose last night?

204
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,160
That woman is invincible.

205
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,540
I didn't know her weakness at that time.

206
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,470
The softest

207
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,960
can beat the hardest.

208
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,830
Sometimes, the best way

209
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:18,840
is not to go head-to-head.

210
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,590
I didn't lose.

211
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,340
I just haven't won yet.

212
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:34,660
Rubbing shoulders with me,

213
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,590
do you really take me as your brother?

214
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,270
If you don't reduce dislocation correctly,

215
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,910
there will be an endless relapse.

216
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,790
I'll do it myself.

217
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:44,500
Hey, trust me.

218
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,960
I know a lot of

219
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,290
injuries like this.

220
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:49,880
Trust me.

221
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,010
I mean it.

222
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:08,020
Her timing was wrong.

223
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,700
She was blocked by Zhong,

224
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,730
and then she was hit on the back by Mei Zhu.

225
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,170
She got a dislocation of her left shoulder.

226
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,500
I hit him in the same position too.

227
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,220
It's not easy for him.

228
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:17,800
Here.

229
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,600
The back.

230
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,080
I'm gonna do it.

231
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:30,670
[Liansheng Workshop]

232
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,000
It hurts.

233
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,700
Do you want to die?

234
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:40,570
No.

235
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,110
Look at you now, so strong!

236
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,500
Is it because I'm good at it?

237
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,710
You're cranky.

238
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,250
Only I can live with it.

239
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:14,780
After taking this elixir,

240
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,490
your internal strength will be recovered within two days.

241
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,400
This is the secret elixir in my clan.

242
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,640
You still don't trust me?

243
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,920
Then you don't trust yourself.

244
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,660
Fooling me with syrup.

245
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,560
This elixir is extremely bitter.

246
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,210
I added honey in it.

247
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,510
If you have ointment for blood circulation,

248
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,640
you should put some on it.

249
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:54,970
Well.

250
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,320
It's a gift from you,

251
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,810
I'll keep it for a few more days.

252
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,700
That's just great.

253
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:06,330
Everyone knows my wife is a spitfire.

254
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:08,270
You...

255
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,620
What is the elixir?

256
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,660
Do you feel there's anything else uncomfortable

257
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:19,540
except for the weakness?

258
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,120
That's good.

259
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,020
I didn't tell you earlier.

260
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:27,700
After taking this elixir,

261
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:29,210
your meridians will be locked

262
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,650
and your internal strength will be dispersed.

263
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:32,580
For how long?

264
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,900
I told you,

265
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,860
you'll recover in two days.

266
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,770
I really want to kill you.

267
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,070
Can you handle Tang Xiao by yourself if he comes?

268
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,410
No matter how powerful Tang Xiao is,

269
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,920
he has to fear the law.

270
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,500
If he succeeded last night,

271
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,530
he would have deceived the whole world and destroyed the evidence.

272
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,080
But now that his plan is exposed,

273
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,030
he won't ask for trouble.

274
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,090
You know everything.

275
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:57,650
Tell me who is the one behind Tang Xiao?

276
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,410
Here, sit.

277
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:08,160
Okay.

278
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:10,600
Let me ask you first.

279
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,280
Were you the one

280
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,620
who followed Mo Bufan and me yesterday?

281
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,770
And the scar on your left shoulder

282
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:26,710
was from an injury Kang Qiao inflicted on you with a stone, right?

283
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:34,980
You fooled me to take the elixir,

284
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,060
because you were afraid that I'd hurt you.

285
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,740
I was helping you with your wound.

286
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:41,140
Yanan,

287
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,800
answer me honestly.

288
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,090
Why did you do that?

289
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,770
You are ambiguous

290
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,840
and unrealistic.

291
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,780
I wasn't sure about the situation so I wanted to figure it out.

292
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,510
That's all.

293
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,140
I tried my best to win Mo Bufan over.

294
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,460
I just wanted to work with him

295
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,280
to deal with Qi Tianfeng.

296
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,760
But you hurt his people at the crucial moment.

297
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,450
If he gets suspicious,

298
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,560
my chance of winning will be less.

299
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,470
You should have told me earlier.

300
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,100
Haven't I told you enough?

301
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:43,430
But what you asked me to do is over the line.

302
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,010
I didn't know what you want to do.

303
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,270
You must hide it well.

304
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,820
You'd better hide it until it's forgotten and

305
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,070
impossible to be exposed again.

306
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,910
If I were killed yesterday,

307
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:01,230
wouldn't it be safer for me to disappear with the secret?

308
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,750
How could I not save you?

309
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,220
I've plotted so much this time.

310
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,870
The show is about to start.

311
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:22,230
You,

312
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,810
don't make any more trouble.

313
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,380
Do you hear me?

314
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:58,400
Jin,

315
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,410
I'll pay fifty taels of silver for Tang Xiao's head.

316
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:06,660
Are you insulting me on purpose?

317
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,450
If it was that easy,

318
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,470
was from an injury Kang Qiao inflicted on you with a stone, right?

319
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,340
Then we work together.

320
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,230
He provoked us,

321
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,610
I can barely sleep without revenge.

322
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,900
With your kung fu,

323
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:26,450
what can you do even if there are ten more like you?

324
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:30,710
Stop sharpening.

325
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:33,000
I knew I was late.

326
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,230
You didn't dare to draw your knife but now mock me instead.

327
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:37,610
They say you're a hero,

328
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:39,310
it turns out you just bully the weak and fear the strong.

329
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,880
You sound tough.

330
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,280
Do you mind a fight?

331
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,220
Sure.

332
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,790
I told you that you're not flexible.

333
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:52,150
I'll let you know

334
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,020
how unstable your lower body is.

335
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,630
Why did you make a sneak attack?

336
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,230
How could you ask such a question?

337
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,010
Your martial arts skills are really promising.

338
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:15,650
Enough.

339
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,460
That's what your strength is used for.

340
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,040
It's just a competition,

341
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:29,610
why did you hit him so hard?

342
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:33,240
Let's go.

343
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,770
Jin.

344
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,570
Thanks for saving our lives.

345
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,610
Thank you for my sister.

346
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,240
Tian Hu.

347
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,320
What are you doing?

348
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:57,880
Get up.

349
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,080
Last night, my sister told me

350
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:02,380
that you said you love money,

351
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:04,980
but you risked your life for us when we were in danger.

352
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:05,920
You are a true master.

353
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,940
She was in a hurry just now.

354
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:10,980
Please forgive her.

355
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,730
She got angry with me for Su Mingyu.

356
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,860
I don't know who risked his life yesterday.

357
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,050
She knows it clearly.

358
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:18,130
Why are you kneeling again? Get up.

359
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:19,780
I...

360
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,010
I don't want to kneel,

361
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,070
but there's no other way to thank you.

362
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,250
It's good that you know what I mean.

363
00:29:29,730 --> 00:29:30,310
Forget it.

364
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:41,600
Don't worry. It's just a minor injury.

365
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,650
I couldn't be there yesterday.

366
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,580
I felt so regretful.

367
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,920
That's why I spoke harshly to Jin.

368
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,090
He was drunk yesterday,

369
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:57,820
so he didn't win.

370
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,060
You even add fuel to the fire.

371
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,450
He should have hit you harder.

372
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,730
You didn't say that just now.

373
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:19,910
Why do falling flowers pine for love?

374
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,510
Why is flowing water heartless?

375
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:24,760
I don't know about that.

376
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,840
I only know

377
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:29,460
I'm always thinking about you.

378
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,300
I don't know what day it is.

379
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,980
Your uniform is old.

380
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,290
I'll make you a new one.

381
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,570
I like the old one too.

382
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,680
If you give me a new one,

383
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:00,120
I'll keep this

384
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:01,080
and preserve it.

385
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,360
Yesterday, Tang Xiao

386
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,500
didn't seem to come at me,

387
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:12,340
but at Jin and Miss Shu.

388
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:13,620
Them?

389
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,180
So they're coming at Mr Yun?

390
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,280
I wonder

391
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:23,760
what boss Yun thinks of the arson case.

392
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,890
If, as you said, the arsonist wasn't Tang Xiao,

393
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:37,990
who could it be?

394
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,170
I suspect this is their first move.

395
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,480
By the way,

396
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,340
what does President Su think of this matter?

397
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:46,460
She didn't say much.

398
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,800
Your sister has been the President of the Chamber of Commerce for many years.

399
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,420
She is not an ordinary woman.

400
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,470
Since you don't want to tell me,

401
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,910
listen to me

402
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:57,830
and check with her words.

403
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,630
Maybe today, tomorrow at the latest,

404
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,610
the business community of Nandu City will be in chaos.

405
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:06,370
As the century-old silk merchant,

406
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,560
your family should take the lead,

407
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,350
and you will be involved in this turmoil.

408
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,490
Nothing is going on now.

409
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:12,830
How can I trust you?

410
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:15,890
Where are we going?

411
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,350
Although you don't want to go into business,

412
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,460
but you are not stupid.

413
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,500
Let's take a look first.

414
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,640
It's completely sold out.

415
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:26,830
It's hoarding and speculation.

416
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,270
Why would I lie to you?

417
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,140
I'll offer a high price.

418
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,900
How about two taels of silver for one catty?

419
00:32:32,230 --> 00:32:33,240
Two taels of silver for one catty raw silk.

420
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,180
I've never heard of it.

421
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,550
This is just the beginning.

422
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:37,870
You can check it in a few days.

423
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,700
It's Mr Su.

424
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:42,080
Let's go.

425
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:43,950
Go.

426
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,330
Mr Su, Mr Su.

427
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,340
Mr Su, don't run!

428
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:49,260
Hurry!

429
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:50,860
Run!

430
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,150
Mr Su! Mr Su!

431
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,300
Wait, Mr Su.

432
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,490
It's horrible.

433
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:10,080
How did this happen?

434
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,500
Do you trust me now?

435
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,220
So, raising the silk price is the second move.

436
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,790
The person who set fire is the one behind all the things.

437
00:33:20,910 --> 00:33:23,120
You're intelligent, that's true.

438
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,350
But there are so many merchants,

439
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,930
who is the one?

440
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,740
I'm afraid it's impossible to tell.

441
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,850
[Juxing Tea House]

442
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:34,960
Normally,

443
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:38,840
One catty raw silk costs three or four qian of silver.

444
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:40,060
But now

445
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,660
it costs two taels and six of silver.

446
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,350
It may increase by three taels of silver before the market is closed.

447
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,010
Your guess

448
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:53,150
is not much different from what Miss Su said.

449
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,900
Uncle Qian, you didn't see that.

450
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,650
I was surrounded by

451
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,480
most of the silk merchants in Nandu City.

452
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,680
They must think we are short of silk,

453
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,250
and we have to accept the price.

454
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,540
You will turn cloth over to the imperial court,

455
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,739
it's reasonable to buy silk at a high price.

456
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,830
Be in charge of the Chamber of Commerce,

457
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:16,880
your family don't lower silk price,

458
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,850
but take part in raising it.

459
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:19,639
That's impossible.

460
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:21,110
If my sister disturbs the silk market,

461
00:34:21,469 --> 00:34:22,460
she will be convicted by the government.

462
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:23,469
In this way,

463
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,580
they get what they want.

464
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:29,320
Did I prove their rumors

465
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:31,440
in the silk shop earlier?

466
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:32,699
If not you,

467
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:34,219
there will be someone else

468
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,469
who buy the silk at a high price by your name.

469
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:39,120
Mr Yun,

470
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,820
you seem to know this very well.

471
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,360
It's just a little trick.

472
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,820
So sister is going to Yangzhou

473
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,940
to purchase a large amount of raw silk,

474
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,130
and also lower the silk price.

475
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,310
Uncle Qian.

476
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,040
When will the caravan depart?

477
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,240
Tonight.

478
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,140
I've arranged the roads and waterways.

479
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,030
Butler Qian,

480
00:35:01,950 --> 00:35:03,350
I'm afraid we won't be able to use the wateaway.

481
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,760
Do you want to go to the Water Gang again?

482
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:09,380
Don't you remember when we came back from Yangzhou last time,

483
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,090
the robbers went straight to the raw silk.

484
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,420
Who were they after?

485
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,730
I think you know it.

486
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:29,490
If the waterway doesn't work,

487
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,680
the roads will take three more days.

488
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:34,660
The soldiers and bandits must be dangerous along the way.

489
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:36,130
Uncle Qian.

490
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,270
I must go this time.

491
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:39,020
No.

492
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,500
Uncle Qian.

493
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,660
Miss Su has made up her mind.

494
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,150
Stop arguing.

495
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,410
Mr Yun,

496
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,250
Miss Su said,

497
00:35:51,710 --> 00:35:52,600
she hopes

498
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,550
you can be a friend of our family.

499
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:56,800
I didn't know what it means.

500
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,510
But today, I really understand.

501
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:29,640
Yun Xiang,

502
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,140
you're right.

503
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,790
I'm afraid that my family will be in trouble.

504
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,250
If you can help us get through this,

505
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,330
I will repay you

506
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:41,350
with gratitude.

507
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,290
We met by chance.

508
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,250
We had many misunderstandings, but treated each other with sincerity in the end.

509
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,270
If the Su family is in danger,

510
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:50,930
I will definitely help.

511
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,620
But President Su and Boss Qian

512
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,320
don't seem to have trusted me yet.

513
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,440
This is why I hate business.

514
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:58,420
They've run a business for a long time,

515
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,130
so they don't trust anyone.

516
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,330
Yun Xiang.

517
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:10,720
I trust you.

518
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:14,410
Great.

519
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:16,520
Since you trust me,

520
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,140
you can't go to transport raw silk.

521
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,940
I will need you in the future.

522
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,550
Your brother hasn't come back.

523
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,870
Why are you looking for me?

524
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,820
Mr Jin, did you forget?

525
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:34,940
Mr Su and you were eating in our restaurant that day.

526
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:37,070
You asked my brother to pack up the leftover

527
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,170
and send it to a place.

528
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:40,220
Yes.

529
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,560
Hasn't he come back yet?

530
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:42,420
No.

531
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,800
It's been 3 days, Mr Jin...

532
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,370
Don't worry.

533
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:46,660
I'll go check it out.

534
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:48,730
I'll let you know tomorrow morning.

535
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:49,880
Thank you, Mr Jin.

536
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,100
Thanks a lot!

537
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:12,400
Girl,

538
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,680
do you know how to read the ledger?

539
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,480
Check the ledger.

540
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:15,670
Miss Ke can handle it.

541
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,350
Why am I looking for her?

542
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:18,690
Come with me.

543
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,320
I'll buy you a drink later.

544
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,220
What ledger do you want to check?

545
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,270
You'll know when we get there.

546
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:53,460
Master Jin.

547
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,390
Jia.

548
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,350
Please, come in.

549
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:57,990
Madam.

550
00:38:58,770 --> 00:38:59,590
Master Jin is here.

551
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:02,980
Master Jin.

552
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:06,800
Did kids like the desserts

553
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,060
sent the day before yesterday?

554
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,040
They loved it.

555
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,550
Thank you, Master Jin.

556
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:13,380
It was not enough for them,

557
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:15,370
so I made something similar at night.

558
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,480
After the young man sent the desserts,

559
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,270
did he leave directly?

560
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,630
He wanted some money at first.

561
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,170
And then he saw that we did it for the kids,

562
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,750
so he left directly.

563
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,810
You entrusted kids here?

564
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,130
You don't know about it.

565
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,180
Master Jin

566
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,640
has been sponsoring us for more than two years.

567
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:42,520
He's the most generous donor in our Jishantang.

568
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,210
Yes, yes.

569
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,880
Are they asleep?

570
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,680
Not yet.

571
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,630
Go and bring them out.

572
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,390
OK, please wait a moment.

573
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,890
Master Jin, you don't know about it.

574
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,060
These kids are very naughty.

575
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:08,870
I'm afraid he can't do it alone.

576
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,750
I'll go take a look. Have a seat.

577
00:40:11,370 --> 00:40:12,010
Thank you.

578
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,540
How is it? Have they arrived?

579
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:37,520
I sent a signal.

580
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,650
They should be here soon.

581
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,420
Have you paid enough money?

582
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,120
Of course.

583
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:40,690
We can't

584
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,030
beat Jin Shiliang.

585
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,800
There should be three people.

586
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:59,620
do you know how to read the ledger?

587
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:00,950
All have arrived.

588
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,620
There is one more woman.

589
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,910
No need to waste the money.

590
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,900
That woman is weak.

591
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:11,750
I can handle it.

592
00:41:20,030 --> 00:41:20,390
Girl!

593
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,760
Your own kid is here?

594
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:37,080
Take the kid back and we'll take care of him.

595
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:38,740
What are you talking about?

596
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,060
If the swordsmen in Jiangnan get into trouble,

597
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,000
and their families can't raise the orphans,

598
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,000
they will send them here.

599
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,470
You're already in danger.

600
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,140
How can you care about others?

601
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,570
Shut up. Just check the ledger.

602
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,450
Tell me, is this ledger correct?

603
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:55,410
I know it's not correct without checking it.

604
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:57,440
Why?

605
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:00,650
Those two have taken care of over 20 kids.

606
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,930
They must have tons of housework to do.

607
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:03,760
But I just saw their hands.

608
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,320
They are not rough at all.

609
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:10,140
No wonder I feel something is wrong.

610
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:14,350
Let's go.

611
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,210
Come with me.

612
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:16,970
No.

613
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:19,540
Yun Xiang fooled me to take an elixir.

614
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,740
My meridians are locked and my internal strength is weak.

615
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:22,800
I'll be a burden to you.

616
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:24,190
This guy!

617
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,430
Is there anyone he doesn't fool with?

618
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:27,720
Stay here.

619
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:28,600
By the way,

620
00:42:29,470 --> 00:42:31,210
if anyone comes out, keep him alive.

621
00:42:59,150 --> 00:42:59,700
Jia Chang'an.
