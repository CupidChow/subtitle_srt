00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:56,100
Four to one.

5
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,420
15 bets.

6
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,640
2,200 taels were bet.

7
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,660
We need to pay 8,800 taels.

8
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,340
Five to one.

9
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,890
17 bets.

10
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:09,300
3,050 taels were bet.

11
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,070
We need to pay…

12
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,340
Just give me the total number.

13
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,300
No way.

14
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,880
After paying Mr. Yun,

15
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,960
it's time to pay us.

16
00:02:22,450 --> 00:02:23,180
Coming through.

17
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:36,270
Sit.

18
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,260
I've been wondering

19
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:48,120
where you got the nerve

20
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,160
to put so much money at stake.

21
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:52,820
It turns out you got such a rich sponsor to back you up.

22
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,390
Mr. Tang, you're wrong.

23
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,000
It's just business.

24
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,920
Guanghui Bank just gave Mr. Yun a loan.

25
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,750
That's what banks do.

26
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,110
Besides,

27
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:04,330
you run a gambling house.

28
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,060
Where your customer got his money

29
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,940
shouldn't be your concern.

30
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,000
Are you done calculating?

31
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,800
A total of 17,700 taels were bet.

32
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,380
W-We need to pay

33
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,340
75,300 taels.

34
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,260
Manager Qi,

35
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,170
you seem to have missed a bet.

36
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,150
I bet 10,000 taels more before all bets were closed.

37
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:26,650
Seven to one.

38
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,970
You should pay me

39
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:31,329
145,300 taels in total.

40
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,700
No more wagers should be accepted then.

41
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,370
Be a good sport.

42
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,910
Don't lose your cool just because of a bet.

43
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:41,120
Yes.

44
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,540
You started it.

45
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,190
Who'd have known Mr. Tang is a deadbeat?

46
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,140
Right?

47
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,100
Yes.

48
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:46,920
Mr. Tang,

49
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,510
we also owe more than 50,000 taels of silver to the other gamblers.

50
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,960
We don't have much silver left.

51
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:10,830
Since we're in the same business,

52
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,540
I don't mind taking a step back.

53
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:14,850
Mr. Tang.

54
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,320
You can pay me those 70,000 taels

55
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:19,899
with three things.

56
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:21,899
First,

57
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,590
according to the contract,

58
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,080
I lost and should be a slave to the Tang family.

59
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,220
I wonder

60
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,580
if you still want me to be your slave now.

61
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,100
[Contract]

62
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:49,970
Good.

63
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:51,830
Second,

64
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,590
I need you to release Ten Taels of Gold.

65
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,440
I want him to be unscathed.

66
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,560
You have to pay 10,000 taels

67
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:00,190
for each wound on him.

68
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,760
I can let him go,

69
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:05,820
but I have no money to pay you.

70
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:06,800
Okay.

71
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,570
Third,

72
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,080
my manager Miss Ke

73
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,820
has sent you the message as planned.

74
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:19,250
Have you prepared the document

75
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,630
that elevates her out of the lowly status?

76
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,040
Yes.

77
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,650
And the antidote to Heart Devouring Powder.

78
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,880
Tianhu needs it.

79
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,540
You'll speak when spoken to, stupid woman!

80
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,490
You said three things.

81
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,050
That's four.

82
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,620
You can refuse,

83
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,140
but I'll take the people outside

84
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,460
to your basement in the backyard

85
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:49,550
and show them what the famous Mr. Tang

86
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,060
enjoys doing when no one is watching.

87
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:08,410
Step aside.

88
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:10,910
It's fine.

89
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:11,970
Let her in.

90
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,220
Miss Shu.

91
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,700
There are many traps down there.

92
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,820
You'd better stay here.

93
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,930
If anything happened to Ten Taels of Gold,

94
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,460
I'd make you pay with your lives.

95
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,640
You know what's going on down there.

96
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,700
You're a woman too.

97
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,070
Why would you work for him?

98
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,390
Are you under his control as well?

99
00:06:48,409 --> 00:06:49,409
I need something from him.

100
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,670
I heard you can't feel pain and are immune to poison.

101
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,710
You must need some secret medicine

102
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,909
to stay that way.

103
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,950
Is that your deal with Tang Xiao?

104
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,260
Do you know the consequence of working for a scoundrel?

105
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,700
The strong don't fear consequences.

106
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,460
The weak,

107
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,340
like those women down there, only deserve to grovel.

108
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,230
You're just as hopeless as Tang Xiao.

109
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,330
I'll kill him one day.

110
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,040
Before that, I'll kill you.

111
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,159
Those 70,000 taels are written off,

112
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,120
but you still need to pay me 75,300 taels.

113
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:49,080
When can you give them to me?

114
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,420
Or do you need more time?

115
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,220
Young Master Xiang,

116
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,720
you're really a madman.

117
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:58,900
Why?

118
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,390
When it comes to gambling,

119
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,140
one should only place a bet

120
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:06,660
when winning is a sure thing.

121
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,660
But look at you.

122
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,660
You did

123
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,090
the opposite.

124
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,430
You stood to lose

125
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,100
and tricked me into the game.

126
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:18,700
Both of us ended with great losses.

127
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,280
Young Master Xiang.

128
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,070
You look so composed now,

129
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,270
but have you ever calculated

130
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,130
how much money Liansheng House lost this time?

131
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,380
No matter how much Liansheng House lost,

132
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,710
Guanghui Bank will cover it.

133
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,230
But I bet the money in your account

134
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,190
belongs to someone you answer to.

135
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,580
You have to take so much money out this time.

136
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:43,539
How will you explain things to the person behind you?

137
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,940
What on earth has Qi Tianfeng

138
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,910
told you about me?

139
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:50,050
What he said doesn't matter.

140
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,520
What matters

141
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,650
is how many secrets you're keeping.

142
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:56,990
To keep those secrets,

143
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,970
you pitted yourself against me and risked everything you have.

144
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,790
The secrets I want to know

145
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,520
don't include you joining hands with Qi Tianfeng

146
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,570
to kill Wen Cong,

147
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,260
or you colluding with the Lingyuan Sect secretly.

148
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,170
We may be eavesdropped here.

149
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,330
How about this?

150
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:19,990
Let's meet at Shangxin Pavilion tomorrow at 3 p.m.

151
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,910
If you show up on time,

152
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,960
I can give you more time

153
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,220
to collect those 75,300 taels.

154
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,910
You just said one should only bet

155
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,200
when winning is a sure thing.

156
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,700
But let me tell you.

157
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,620
The best way to win

158
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,870
is through losing.

159
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,270
With despair comes hope.

160
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:03,900
Move.

161
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,150
Jin.

162
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:07,250
Leave him alone.

163
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:11,980
The key.

164
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,200
Where is my sword?

165
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:21,660
Let's go back first.

166
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,310
I can't wait.

167
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,680
Then let's settle the scores here.

168
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,620
Bring it on.

169
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,940
There's no rush, Jin.

170
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,810
They're scumbags.

171
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,940
The fact that they're still breathing sickens me.

172
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,650
I'm with you.

173
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,300
But think about Tianhu.

174
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,670
The poison could kill her at any time.

175
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,820
I've got the antidote.

176
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,390
Let's send her the antidote first.

177
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:47,490
Let's go.

178
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,070
If it weren't for Tianhu,

179
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,730
I'd tear that pest Tang Xiao into pieces

180
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,810
before going back.

181
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,100
Calm down, Jin.

182
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,990
It doesn't hurt to let him live for one more day.

183
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:08,810
One more day?

184
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:09,880
What?

185
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,170
You're going to meet him again tomorrow?

186
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,010
Show me the antidote.

187
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,620
Tang Xiao is unscrupulous.

188
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,420
What if this is poison?

189
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:28,950
Let me smell it.

190
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:34,580
Skullcap root.

191
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,470
Phellodendron.

192
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:37,770
Great burdock achene.

193
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,450
And…

194
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,250
Rhododendron molle. Carpesium fruit.

195
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:49,950
Rhododendron molle?

196
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,580
It's highly toxic.

197
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,360
A proper amount of it

198
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,060
has a mind-calming effect.

199
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:56,660
Carpesium fruit is the same.

200
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,110
Both of them are detoxifying.

201
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:03,990
Miss Ke.

202
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,220
Tianhu.

203
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:06,800
Tianhu.

204
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:08,870
Miss Ke.

205
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,460
Hang in there. The antidote is coming.

206
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,620
Miss Ke.

207
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,560
Tianhu.

208
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,150
It hurts.

209
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:15,870
I know.

210
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:19,340
I...

211
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,340
Am I going to die?

212
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:21,940
No.

213
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,480
The antidote will be here soon.

214
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,450
Hold on.

215
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:25,740
Here's the antidote.

216
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,620
Jin.

217
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,740
Give it to me.

218
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,760
Here, Tianhu.

219
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,260
I won't take it.

220
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,100
I'd rather die.

221
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:35,870
Tianhu.

222
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:38,440
You must eat it.

223
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,850
Open your mouth.

224
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,130
It hurts.

225
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,510
All right.

226
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,990
All right.

227
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,100
You'll be fine.

228
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,220
You'll be fine.

229
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:03,370
Look around.

230
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:04,880
It's only been three days,

231
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,580
but it looks like a tornado has been here.

232
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,820
No one bothers to clean it up?

233
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,760
The staff stayed up for three days,

234
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,320
so once there was no more suspense,

235
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,140
I asked them to go back and rest.

236
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,990
Do you know that kindness is useless on the battlefield

237
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,250
and in business?

238
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,100
My sister told me that,

239
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,860
but I don't agree.

240
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,490
Are you going to plead for Ke Menglan?

241
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,800
You know things were hard for Menglan.

242
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,570
If you want to fire her,

243
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,180
I'll find her somewhere else to stay.

244
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:37,980
Please don't be hard on her.

245
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:39,020
Fire her?

246
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,500
Then tell me who will run Liansheng House

247
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:42,560
for me in the future.

248
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,660
You'll let it slide?

249
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,580
You two are a great match.

250
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,310
Cherish her.

251
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,910
Are you feeling better now?

252
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,120
Let me see.

253
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,220
Her pulse is stable.

254
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,300
She's in the clear now.

255
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,380
Are you still feeling uncomfortable?

256
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,500
I wish I had died.

257
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,860
She keeps saying that.

258
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,660
Don't cry.

259
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:01,560
Tianhu.

260
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,100
That day...

261
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,290
Forget it.

262
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:16,000

263
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,340
What did you do to Tianhu?

264
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,790
Am I that kind of person?

265
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,740
I heard

266
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,730
that Tang Xiao is marrying Tianhu to Jin.

267
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,660
Miss Ke, stop talking.

268
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,600

269
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:30,850
What did you do?

270
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,150
I didn't do anything.

274

Come with me.

276
00:15:41,010 --> 00:15:41,950
I can't explain.

I'm tired. Let's talk tomorrow.

278
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:45,390
Don't go. Tell me.

279
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,850
What did you do to Tianhu?

280
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,250
Tianhu.

281
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,970
Can you explain things to her for me?

282
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,980
This crazy girl

283
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,770
is capable of anything when she's angry.

284
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,130
Why can't we talk inside?

285
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:18,560
Yun said

286
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,430
you can still be the manager of Liansheng House.

287
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:27,540
No boss would use someone who betrayed him.

288
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,500
I think Mr. Yun just didn't want to embarrass you.

289
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,510
After Tianhu recovers, I'll leave

290
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:38,970
so that you two won't be on bad terms.

291
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,130
You think too much.

292
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:42,950
Not only did he not blame you,

293
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,320
he also prepared a generous gift for you.

294
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,050

Stay alive.

301

After you grow up, do everything it takes to get elevated out of lowly status.

302

Remember that. Menglan.

303

Actually, Yun

309
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,170
is not narrow-minded.

310
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,910
He's really good at strategies.

311
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,060
He's hard to understand

312
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,180
but not cold-hearted.

313
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,930
When he made plans,

314
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,290
he had our best interests in mind.

315
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,370
He knows what we care about the most.

316
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,460
It turns out

317
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,230
that I'm the most despicable person here.

318
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,110
That's nonsense.

319
00:18:17,630 --> 00:18:18,310
That's true.

320
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,960
I made friends with Miss Shu

321
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,530
and treated Mr. Yun respectfully.

322
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:33,890

00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,570
Open all the doors and windows.

376
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,530
Light the incense too.

377
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:12,700
Go get ready.

378
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:13,350
Okay.

379
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,490
Use rosin.

380
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:16,610
It's refreshing.

381
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,320
Yes.

382
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:21,930
Did you sleep well last night?

383
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:26,660
Mr. Yun.

384
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,360
Yun.

385
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,390
Didn't you say we'll be closed for a few days?

386
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:30,650
Why did you reopen so soon?

387
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:31,840
Menglan is the manager.

388
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,930
She calls the shots.

389
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:41,660
Running a gambling house is like panning for gold in flowing water.

390
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,500
If we take a break,

391
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,600
we'll miss the gold.

392
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,970
Manager Ke, do you know

393
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,780
that many people here are Tang Xiao's spies?

394
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,990
You may get in trouble for doing this.

395
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,020
Since the competition is over,

396
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:05,410
Tang Xiao's trusted men will not come back.

397
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,120
Those who stay were just paid to do their job.

398
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,200
They are in no way

399
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,760
more untrustworthy than me.

400
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,790
If you trust me,

401
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,840
please trust them as well.

402
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,350
Manager Ke,

403
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:24,270
Liansheng House is lucky

404
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,880
to have you as its manager.

405
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,580
I'm lucky to have you work for me.

406
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:29,880
Thank you for staying.

407
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:41,570
Where are we going to meet them?

408
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,590
You'll see.

409
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,090
Then what are we waiting for?

410
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,600
You may have to fight tooth and nail today.

411
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,200
Do you need to bring more men?

412
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,520
You said Manager Ke burned that document.

413
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,450
She burned it once she got it.

414
00:26:19,390 --> 00:26:20,430
Was she out of her mind?

415
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,530
With that burned,

416
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:24,340
she'll be of the low lot for her whole life.

417
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,680
What an interesting woman.

418
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:28,860
She's staked her whole life

419
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,030
on that guy Su Mingyu.

420
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,530
Menglan is proud.

421
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,890
She probably just didn't want to be trapped by her parentage.

422
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,860
That's a real gamble.

423
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,380
I don't have the guts to do that.

424
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,340
You never risked anything.

425
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:44,800
Your gambles are all fake.

426
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:45,860
Jin.

427
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,690
Yun Xiang is scheming.

428
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,520
But has he ever done you wrong?

429
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,530
Girl,

430
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,290
are you blind or stupid?

431
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,900
I'm not the only one he took advantage of.

432
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:55,330
He used you a lot of times too.

433
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:04,070
You're right.

434
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:08,310
It's fair to say that I'm selfish.

435
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,500
But after I met you guys,

436
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,360
I found Jin straightforward, Mingyu sincere,

437
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,460
Manager Ke resilient.

438
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,110
And you...

439
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,260
What?

440
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,430
Anyway, only after I met you guys did I realize

441
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,690
that this is a colorful world

442
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,160
where people care for each other.

443
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,420
I want to be part of this world.

444
00:27:44,290 --> 00:27:45,330
Don't change the subject.

445
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:46,220
You found me what?

446
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,630
Enough flirting.

447
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:27,970
Yun Xiang.

448
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,170
You were right about fighting.

449
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,890
But we don't have to fight tooth and nail

450
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,710
to beat those two scumbags.

451
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:37,360
You're good at using poison,

452
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,100
but poison doesn't work on Meizhu.

453
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,860
If you exchange opponents with Jin…

454
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,570
No way.

455
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,640
I don't beat women.

456
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,180
And I don't fight men.

457
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:49,460
I'll tell you what I didn't finish

458
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:51,460
after you come back.

459
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,300
I've been waiting for a long time.

460
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,240
I can wait a bit longer.

461
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:03,930
Jin.

462
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,330
Clear a path for me.

463
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:31,400
Hyah!

464
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,120
I told you

465
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,770
I'll kill you.

466
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:55,920
We'll see about that.

467
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:25,320
I told you

468
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,300
I'm immune to your poison.

469
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,880
You're indeed invulnerable to poison.

470
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:31,760
But these darts are not poisoned.

471
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,790
They're laced with herbs that can get your blood flowing.

472
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:49,430
Most people avoid being hit by my darts,

473
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,020
but you didn't bother to dodge

474
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,460
because you're extraordinarily strong

475
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,720
and can't feel pain.

476
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:57,460
You can hardly notice that you're bleeding.

477
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,100
You hit me low again.

478
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,310
Try something new.

479
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,850
You fought well, but not well enough.

480
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,700
You'll see

481
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,580
that I fight better than you.

482
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:34,690
You should've taken my advice.

483
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,980
What's holding you back?

484
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:44,270
Tianhu remembered

485
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:47,090
you giving her those beads to suppress the poison.

486
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:49,650
You said the weak only deserve to grovel.

487
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:52,010
Does it sound ridiculous

488
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:53,640
to you now?

489
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,550
I'm controlled by Tang Xiao.

490
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,450
You're controlled by Young Master Xiang.

491
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,000
Both of us are weak.

492
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,090
You're wrong.

493
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:09,889
Yun Xiang never controls me.

494
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:13,460
You've bled too much. No one can save you.

495
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:15,719
Since there's still good in you,

496
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:17,449
I can give you a quick death.

497
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,560
Only the strong deserve to live.

498
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:26,480
I don't need your pity.

499
00:34:54,699 --> 00:34:55,800
How many rounds did you fight?

500
00:34:56,310 --> 00:34:57,020
Looks like you had a hard time.

501
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,780
Says someone whose sword was broken in half.

502
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:06,330
Hold this.

503
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,420
You look better now. Let's go.

504
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:18,510
Where are we going?

505
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:21,020
We have a score to settle.

506
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,180
That lackeys are dead.

507
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,570
Who do you think will be the next?

508
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,920
Where is Yun Xiang going to meet Tang Xiao?

509
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:33,910
You're the coachman. You tell me.

510
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,450
He only told me to go east after leaving the city.

511
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,990
He didn't want me to kill Tang Xiao.

512
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:42,700
He knew this would happen halfway.

513
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,350
We've been set up!

514
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,640
Stop shaking your head.

515
00:36:05,590 --> 00:36:07,110
What a surprise!

516
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,420
Are you here to check out the view too?

517
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,230
You must have been waiting for me for a long time.

518
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:13,660
The road ahead is bumpy.

519
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,580
Let's ride.

520
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:17,710
What?

521
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,920
You planned to meet Tang Xiao without me.

522
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:21,000
Am I an outsider to you?

523
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:22,780
We'll be talking about some private matters.

524
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:24,020
About the Luo family's village, right?

525
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,780
I know something about what happened.

526
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:26,450
If I go with you,

527
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,280
I can tell you whether he's lying.

528
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:28,860
Let's go.

529
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:29,860
Wait for me here.

530
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:30,650
Okay.

531
00:36:56,850 --> 00:36:58,320
Please have a seat.

532
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:04,600
Why are you still alive?

533
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:06,310
It's a long story.

534
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,760
Let's sit down first.

535
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,860
Here. Leave us.

536
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:13,800
Don't let anyone come close.

537
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,180
Okay.

538
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:15,110
You're so generous.

539
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,630
Thank you so much.

540
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,650
Nandu has numerous bars and tea houses.

541
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:25,730
We can meet in any of them.

542
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,320
But I asked to meet you here

543
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,290
because I knew you'd ambush me.

544
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,260
You think you're smart,

545
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,820
but when you're desperate,

546
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,980
you can't even see through such a lousy trick.

547
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,760
You're bluffing.

548
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,220
I don't believe

549
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,140
Zhong and Meizhu

550
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:46,260
can't beat those two losers working for you.

551
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,900
If I'd known you wouldn't believe me,

552
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,580
I would've brought them along.

553
00:37:53,290 --> 00:37:54,080
But if I had,

554
00:37:55,530 --> 00:37:56,940
I'm afraid you would lose your head

555
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:58,710
before you even say a word.

556
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,610
Young Master Xiang!

557
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,300
If you want to lead the gambling business in Nandu,

558
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,980
I can step down.

559
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,310
Do you have to push me this hard?

560
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,910
Mr. Tang, do you remember the Luo family's village?

561
00:38:15,490 --> 00:38:16,140
The Luo family's village?

562
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,200
You put me through hell

563
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,150
just to ask about that?

564
00:38:25,410 --> 00:38:26,160
The Luo family's village.

565
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,770
A village near the east coast.

566
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,150
You remember it.

567
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,690
Is it because there's something special about that village?

568
00:38:31,830 --> 00:38:33,040
It's a poor and remote place.

569
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,700
What does that village have to do with you?

570
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:40,710
Mr. Mo.

571
00:38:41,690 --> 00:38:43,050
You know what happened in that village.

572
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,710
Why don't you tell him?

573
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,570
I only know that village

574
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:49,910
was rumored to be a pirates' den,

575
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:51,310
which was not true.

576
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:52,810
I don't know whether it was true or not.

577
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,650
But all the villagers there

578
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,220
were killed as pirates.

579
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,930
So,

580
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,840
we ordinary people

581
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,910
should never go against the court.

582
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,470
Am I right?

583
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:07,150
That had nothing to do with you?

584
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:11,100
What crazy things did Qi Tianfeng say to you?

585
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,060
That matter

586
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,360
truly had nothing to do with me.

587
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,520
You're innocent.

588
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:19,490
It surprises me.

589
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,660
There's no need for you

590
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,040
to throw shade on me.

591
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:23,970
I'm not a good person.

592
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:25,450
But I swear I had nothing to do

593
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,840
with that matter.

594
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,980
If you wouldn't be frank with us here,

595
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:30,850
it's okay.

596
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:31,970
We can give you three days.

597
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,090
Within three days,

598
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,240
pay Mr. Yun the 75,000 taels you owe him.

599
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,200
Otherwise, he'll complain to the Chamber of Commerce

600
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,910
and you'll have to pay with your family assets.

601
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,930
Then just tell me

602
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,440
what you want to know.

603
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,360
Everything about the Luo family's village.

604
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:49,680
Mr. Tang, please tell me everything you know.

605
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:58,470
Back then, rumor had it that the court was to lift the sea ban.

606
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,600
Every businessman in Nandu

607
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,970
hurried to the east coast to buy land.

608
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,100
Inevitably,

609
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,900
some land was acquired

610
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,460
by force.

611
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:10,980
You know what I mean, Mr. Mo.

612
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,420
The same tactics were used again and again.

613
00:40:14,330 --> 00:40:14,670
Yes.

614
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,570
Some land was acquired by force,

615
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,310
but slaughtering a village

616
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,360
had never happened before.

617
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,080
I have no idea how that happened.

618
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,710
You know pretty well.

619
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,980
All the money we used to buy land

620
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:30,380
was borrowed from your bank.

621
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,240
You raked in fortunes

622
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,550
and Guanghui Bank became the largest bank in Nandu.

623
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,000
Just talk about the Luo family's village.

624
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:52,540
I collaborated with Wen Cong to buy land.

625
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:55,300
Most landlords there

626
00:40:55,430 --> 00:40:56,870
could be intimidated

627
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:58,470
into selling us their land.

628
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,570
But the Luo family

629
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:02,360
said their ancestors' graves were there

630
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,540
and wouldn't relent no matter what we did.

631
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:06,040
They were dead set on keeping the land.

632
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,860
So you spread rumors that the villagers were pirates

633
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:11,830
and bribed the soldiers to slaughter the village.

634
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,300
In that way,

635
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,780
you didn't even have to pay for the land.

636
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:18,180
I didn't do that.

637
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:21,270
It was a guy working for us. We called him…

638
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:22,800
Sheriff Liu.

639
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:24,870
He said to us

640
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,010
that he'd help us get the land

641
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,270
even if he had to kill the entire village.

642
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,320
No one expected him to really do that.

643
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:34,330
Sheriff Liu?

644
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,300
Where is he now?

645
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,300
He got a promotion for killing the pirates

646
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,000
in the Luo family's village.

647
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:46,460
In less than half a year, he was sent to the front line

648
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,580
in Fujian

649
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,780
with a whole battalion.

650
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:53,900
There, he encountered true pirates and got killed.

651
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:57,970
So,

652
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,370
he just took all the proof to the grave.

653
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:02,800
Unfortunately, yes.

654
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:17,620
Who spread the rumor about lifting the sea ban?

655
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:22,980
I can't answer that question.

656
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,520
Who can?

657
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,800
If I tell you,

658
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,450
the 70,000 taels I owe you…

659
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,700
I can give you one more week without interest.

660
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,400
To get the answer,

661
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,900
you should ask your friend,

662
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,210
the other owner of Liansheng House,

663
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:43,940
Su Mingyu.

664
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,100
He was just around ten years old at that time.

665
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,540
It had nothing to do with him.

666
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,930
It was his father.

667
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:57,240
The one who led us to buy land

668
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,960
was his father,

669
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:05,410
Su Linghe, a member of Nandu Chamber of Commerce.

670
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:21,690
Do you have any evidence to back up your story?

671
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:22,220
The deeds.

672
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,590
The deeds to all the land we bought

673
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,060
were recorded

674
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,040
on the ledger

675
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:30,300
of the Chamber of Commerce.
