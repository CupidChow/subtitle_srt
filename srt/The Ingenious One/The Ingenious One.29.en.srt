For so long,

12
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:25,000
I've confirmed a suspicion that I'd long had.

13
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:30,110
From the beginning,

14
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,250
it was your plan to show up

15
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,270

Then, you showed up

22
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:04,070
It was too coincidental.

00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,620
You know how to lie through your teeth now, yeah?

188
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:15,820
Follow me.

189
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:19,460
Look.

190
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,980
You're talking nonsense during the day. Look.

191
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,290
Why do they have so many people there?

192
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,900
It's their opening day today.

193
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:27,330
They must have hired someone to support the scene.

194
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,220
Let's take a look.

195
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,850
Sir,

196
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,820
what are you doing here?

197
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,890
I'm making a deposit. Obviously.

198
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,510
Guanghui Bank is on the opposite side.

199
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:45,900
Why do you have to wait here?

200
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,980
Haven't you heard about it?

201
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,030
Stop asking.

202
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,300
Go back home and get the money.

203
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:50,600
Deposit it here.

204
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:51,980
The owner of Dafeng Bank

205
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,930
came from Yangzhou.

206
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,100
He said he wanted to make friends with the people of Nandu.

207
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,180
Within three days,

208
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,500
anyone who deposits money in his bank

209
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,100
for a fixed term of three months

210
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,580
will receive ten percent of interest.

211
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,680
I've never heard of

212
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,920
a bank offering ten percent of interest.

213
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,220
Since ancient times,

214
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:07,100
It's already a huge benefit that banks are not charging handling fees.

215
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,600
Why would they give out interest?

216
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:09,370
It's up to you to believe it or not.

217
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:21,350
Lady Yanan, please don't worry.

218
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,070
Mo Bufan will accept the challenge.

219
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,540
How is he doing business?

220
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:30,090
We do business for money.

221
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,820
He's obviously targeting me.

222
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,840
What's happening lately?

223
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,550
It's so hard to live a peaceful life.

224
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:36,830
At this rate,

225
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,770
all of the money in our bank will be withdrawn,

226
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,560
and moved to his bank.

227
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,580
Yeah.

228
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,610
Take out all the money and keep it in his.

229
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,150
Let's see if he can accept it.

230
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,650
To confront Yun Xiang,

231
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:47,800
you have to deal with Su Mingyu and Mo Bufan.

232
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,310
It’s reasonable

233
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,440
to start with Guanghui Bank.

234
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,180
But Mo Bufan is very sophisticated.

235
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,640
I'm afraid he won't take the bait so easily.

236
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:56,920
Lady Yanan.

237
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,200
I've never failed

238
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,070
when I take action personally.

239
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,490
If he finds out,

240
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,060
he'll ask the customers to come to us

241
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,300
and withdraw their money.

242
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,569
Then we will...

243
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,550
He clearly has ill intentions.

244
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,500
Should I...

245
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,660
I stay here

246
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,460
and wait for it to happen?

247
00:17:19,369 --> 00:17:20,800
Why don't we discuss it with Mr. Yun?

248
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,430
What? Do you have a backup plan?

249
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,800
I can't tell you.

250
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,240
I heard that Lady Yanan

251
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:36,000
had a great conversation with Mr. Yun last night.

252
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,720
If you accidentally leak the news,

253
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,700
my efforts will all be in vain.

254
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,650
I had my reasons to see him.

255
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,470
Mr. Nangong, please don't worry.

256
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:53,930
The priority is the interest of Lingyuan Sect.

257
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,420
Since I was ordered to assist you,

258
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:57,890
I will devote myself to it.

259
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,140
You're clearly enemies,

260
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,490
but you still wanted to meet him.

261
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,640
So affectionate.

262
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,910
I'm so jealous.

263
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,180
Don't be bitter.

264
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,710
I always speak in this manner.

265
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,190
Please forgive me.

266
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,550
That day, you said you came for the title of the royal supplier of silk

267
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,680
But even if we defeat Mo Bufan,

268
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:30,140
the foundation of the Su family won't be affected at all.

269
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,910
Don’t worry.

270
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:35,560
Right now,

271
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:36,750
the Su family

272
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,290
is already in danger.

273
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,790
In the name of the Emperor, the imperial edict says

274
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,970
Su Mingyu, the chairman of Nandu Chamber of Commerce,

275
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,430
delayed the capital tribute

276
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,930
and then lost it.

277
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:53,800
Here.

278
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,240
From now on,

279
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,500
the Su family's royal silk supplier procurement certificate

280
00:18:57,590 --> 00:19:00,920
will be suspended immediately.

281
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,860
We will evaluate and pick the best textile mill in Nandu

282
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:07,060
and retitle them as the royal supplier

283
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,180
to deliver the royal tribute.

284
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,320
The end of the announcement.

285
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:14,870
It is my honor to accept it.

286
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,700
Mingyu, come.

287
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,010
Mingyu.

288
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,500
I know

289
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,940
this time,

290
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:39,540
you were wronged.

291
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,380
I wonder

292
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:45,740
who provoked His Majesty.

293
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,160
Actually beforehand,

294
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,370
I even submitted a statement

295
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,010
to plead for you.

296
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,260
But

297
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,430
I can't disobey His Majesty's order.

298
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:01,890
Don't blame me.

299
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:04,540
Uncle Liu,

300
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,300
what are you talking about?

301
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,160
His Majesty has shown mercy

302
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,860
by giving the Su family a chance

303
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:13,410
to compete again in the future.

304
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,020
You didn't know.

305
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,830
Actually, there are

306
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,760
two edicts.

307
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:27,980
Mr. Yun.

308
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:32,420
Mr. Yun!

309
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,220
Mr. Yun!

310
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:50,980
What's wrong?

311
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:51,940
Something happened to Mingyu.

312
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,140
It happened.

313
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,320
In the name of the Emperor, the imperial edict says

314
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,720
Su Mingyu, Chairman of Nandu Chamber of Commerce,

315
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,070
has recently neglected his duty.

316
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,470
You merchants were engaged in farming,

317
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,820
only to make profit.

318
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:14,980
The imperial court was generous enough

319
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,240
to allow the convenience of trade.

320
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,350
[Nandu Chamber of Commerce]

321
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,650
You weren't grateful and content at all,

322
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,630
and colluded with the Chamber of Commerce.

323
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:25,240
causing the silk price in Nandu to skyrocket.

324
00:21:25,380 --> 00:21:26,780
The people are complaining.

325
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,460
Therefore,

326
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:31,490
from today onwards, the Nandu Chamber of Commerce will be closed down

327
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,610
as a warning to others.

328
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:36,860
[May 30, 1941, Tianqing]

329
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,950
The end of the announcement.

330
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,260
Don't be afraid.

331
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,260
Even if you want to start over,

332
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:49,940
I'll be with you.

333
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:56,270
Mingyu,

334
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,420
you're so calm.

335
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,230
I didn't expect you to be so calm.

336
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,190
But

337
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,360
the current crisis

338
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,260
can't be resolved

339
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:11,930
by us comforting each other.

340
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,620
But this is His Majesty's edict.

341
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,630
How else can we solve it?

342
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,660
Two imperial edicts in a row

343
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,340
have affected the foundation of the Su family.

344
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:29,520
But have you ever thought

345
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,290
of the third

346
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:34,870
and fourth imperial edicts?

347
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:38,540
What should we do then?

348
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,780
You mean...

349
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,120
someone is targeting the Su family?

350
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,070
Only government officials can ask

351
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,110
His Majesty to issue the imperial edict.

352
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,870
But we're in business.

353
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,740
We focus on harmony and wealth.

354
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:58,990
The Su family especially

355
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,060
has been carefully maintaining

356
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,360
the relationship with the government.

357
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,540
Mr. Yun, in this case,

358
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,730
is there anyone who's suspicious?

359
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,350
Manager Ke,

360
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,740
please take a break from work

361
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:14,680
for the time being,

362
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,320
and spend more time with Mingyu.

363
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,190
I'll investigate it now.

364
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:21,860
I'll let you know if there's any news.

365
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,240
His name is Nangong Fang.

366
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,420
He is not weaker than you are.

367
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,390
Be careful.

368
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,010
Yun Xiang.

369
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:49,980
Did you come from the Su Residence?

370
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:50,930
You know about it?

371
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,620
I can’t help you

372
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,260
on the Su family's matter.

373
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,680
I have an urgent matter to solve.

374
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,110
A bank was built overnight

375
00:23:58,190 --> 00:23:59,680
right accross Guanghui Bank.

376
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:00,940
He came with ill intentions.

377
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:01,860
He's very aggressive.

378
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:04,480
The owner of the bank is Nangong Fang.

379
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,940
Have you seen him?

380
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,020
I saw him once.

381
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,440
He was hiding malice behind his smile.

382
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:11,600
He's not an ordinary person.

383
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,520
I asked someone to investigate him.

384
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:15,090
He may be living behind the scenes,

385
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,250
but he’s one of the richest businessmen in Yangzhou.

386
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:18,700
In this case, he must be the one

387
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,770
copying Yuntai's approach in Lingyuan.

388
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,700
That's him.

389
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,530
Now you, Mingyu and I

390
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,900
are the top alliance in Nandu.

391
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,960
But overnight,

392
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,140
both families suffered greatly.

393
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:33,960
Is this just a coincidence?

394
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:36,220
No.

395
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,940
No matter how capable Nangong Fang is,

396
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,410
can he use the imperial edict to confront the Su family?

397
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,380
What if that’s the case?

398
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,830
The situation is unclear.

399
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,110
If we act rashly,

400
00:24:52,790 --> 00:24:54,630
it will only cause more trouble to ourselves.

401
00:24:55,090 --> 00:24:55,840
Let's wait and see.

402
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,620
No, this is serious.

403
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,590
I must report it to Master.

404
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:03,470
[Guanghui Bank]

405
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,420
Uncle, you're finally back.

406
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,460
I was looking for you.

407
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,700
We have a guest,

408
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,980
who has been waiting for you until this time.

409
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:14,740
What guest?

410
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,060
Can't you do business without me?

411
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,400
From across the sea.

412
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,350
That's a large sum.

413
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,060
No wonder you came in person.

414
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,700
When will the fortune arrive?

415
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,540
The day after tomorrow.

416
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,380
Three days from now at the latest.

417
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,780
As usual,

418
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,090
trade it in for food, weapons and medicine.

419
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,830
Launder the rest

420
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:44,420
and put them in my account.

421
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,080
Sure, as usual.

422
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,090
I'll take ten percent of the profit.

423
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,460
For half a year.

424
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,220
I promise your money...

425
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,630
Guan,

426
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,310
do you want to launder it faster or slower?

427
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:02,770
What?

428
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,560
Do you have a faster way?

429
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,940
I do have a faster way now.

430
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:08,300
But let me be clear.

431
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:10,390
It's risky and you might lose your money.

432
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:13,380
Tell me.

433
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:15,230
A new bank opened.

434
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,140
Ten percent of interest back for all deposit.

435
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:20,400
What is he up to?

436
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,600
He's giving back ten percent of interest.

437
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,170
It's the Dafeng Bank across the street.

438
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,770
But I don't know what the risks are.

439
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:29,860
He dares to do business like that

440
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,330
because he knew his competitor would take advantage of him.

441
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:34,030
To be suspicious of each other.

442
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,720
It depends on who's right on the timing.

443
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:41,830
That means

444
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,580
we might lose all of it.

445
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,630
It's still on me if you lose money.

446
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,180
You brat.

447
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:53,380
You want to use me to do business.

448
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,960
How about this?

449
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,500
I'll pay for the loss.

450
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,540
Give me two years. There won't be any interest.

451
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:01,660
I'll pay you back all of the sum.

452
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:06,770
But I'll get the ten percent profit.

453
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:07,680
Nonsense!

454
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:09,770
What's in it for me?

455
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:10,940
Within ten days,

456
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,380
Within ten days,

457
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,500
I promise I’ll get all your money

458
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,200
clean and refreshed.

459
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:19,860
Deal.

460
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:22,760
Deal.

461
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:28,720
OK.

462
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:32,540
We'll pick up the goods at the same place the day after tomorrow.

463
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,450
Mr. Xiang,

464
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,930
we finally meet.

465
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,140
It's late at night.

466
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,400
I don't know if you're a friend or foe.

467
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,180
Please tell me your name.

468
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,870
There are so many people in this world.

469
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,340
It doesn't have to be either friend or foe.

470
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,130
Why don't you make a guess, Mr. Yun?

471
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,140
You're not an enemy?

472
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,750
We are, sort of.

473
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,570
Are you here to take my life?

474
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,670
It depends on you.

475
00:29:17,850 --> 00:29:18,460
In that case,

476
00:29:19,310 --> 00:29:20,250
I'm quite sure.

477
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,860
Are you from Lingyuan Sect?

478
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,720
It seems that you have an intention.

479
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,220
Otherwise, you would've taken out the dagger.

480
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,220
You are really smart.

481
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:41,320
No wonder my sister was attracted to you.

482
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:45,450
Lingyuan Sect's master gave birth to a son and a daughter.

483
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,700
The son's name is Kou Yuanjie.

484
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,420
Nice to meet you, Mr. Kou.

485
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,440
You're such a talent.

486
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,600
With a few tactics,

487
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,860
plenty of girls will fall for you.

488
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,340
Why did you mess with Lingyuan's people?

489
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,000
If my sister hadn't protected you,

490
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,530
I would have killed you long ago.

491
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,220
But now even if I don't do it,

492
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,730
you'd be in great trouble.

493
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,430
I'm the only one who can save you.

494
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,320
Since that's the case,

495
00:30:31,810 --> 00:30:33,410
Mr. Kou, why don't you cut to the chase?

496
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:35,900
Are you causing chaos in Nandu

497
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,980
because of Wen Cong?

498
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,530
Nangong Fang is the instigator.

499
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:47,750
You don't have to tell me about it.

500
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:52,780
I'm not only talking about Wen Cong being set up.

501
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:54,870
Their real grudge

502
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,780
could be traced back to 15 years ago.

503
00:30:57,520 --> 00:31:00,370
Back then, it was Nangong Fang who secretly caused

504
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:03,620
Wen Cong to lose control of Nandu's business sector.

505
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,390
They are huge enemies.

506
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,460
Getting rid of him

507
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,090
will be very beneficial to you.

508
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,330
It does more good than harm to Yuntai.

509
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:19,130
My father met an unknown guest.

510
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,060
I'm afraid it's a name

511
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,980
we both don't want to hear.

512
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,030
It's called

513
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:27,820
Lingyuan.

514
00:31:31,070 --> 00:31:31,900
In that case,

515
00:31:32,870 --> 00:31:35,380
Nangong Fang planned the east-coast land purchase case.

516
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,760
Exactly.

517
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,980
Your sister wanted to use me to restrain Nangong Fang.

518
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,180
But why didn't she

519
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,010
mention this past to me?

520
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,450
15 years ago, how could

521
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:53,150
my sister and I get involved in Lingyuan Sect?

522
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:54,780
Besides, she has never had

523
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:56,220
an ambition since she was young.

524
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,130
She never cared about the affairs in Lingyuan.

525
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,240
And even if she knows,

526
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:02,970
she might not tell you.

527
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:03,980
Why?

528
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:07,060
How could she have the courage like a tough man?

529
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,220
She used you

530
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,460
to restrain Nangong Fang.

531
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,170
How could she have the guts to tell you the conflicts in Lingyuan,

532
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,130
let alone deciding to get rid of Nangong Fang?

533
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,210
Get rid of Nangong Fang?

534
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:20,810
Do you have the determination?

535
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,740
I've said a lot,

536
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,750
but I don't know if you are capable of going against him.

537
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,220
Yun Xiang,

538
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,670
if we don't form an alliance,

539
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,280
you will die tonight.

540
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,290
Getting rid of Nangong Fang.

541
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,320
I can complete it by tomorrow.

542
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:03,380
Really?

543
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,840
Didn't your sister tell you

544
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:09,460
I never break a promise?

545
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,500
Since we want to form an alliance,

546
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,700
I hope you can answer two questions.

547
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:20,380
First,

548
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,220
what is Nangong Fang's background?

549
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,070
Second,

550
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,860
your sister wanted to restrain him.

551
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,940
Why would she join hands with him

552
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:30,790
to confront me?

553
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,970
How can I explain it in a few words?

554
00:33:34,730 --> 00:33:37,110
Take your time. I want to know.

555
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,060
So you mean

556
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,460
there are still remnants of Lingyuan in Nandu?

557
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:49,080
Yes.

558
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:50,900
As soon as I got the news,

559
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,060
I went to the government office to find Mr. Shao.

560
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,180
I came here hastily

561
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,180
as soon as I knew you're visiting Her Highness.

562
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,460
Do you have any evidence?

563
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,120
No.

564
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,260
Ridiculous.

565
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,090
If they randomly testify like you,

566
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,220
wouldn't that be...

567
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,090
Mr. Shao,

568
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,820
Mr. Yun has played a crucial role

569
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,930
in the water ghost robbery case.

570
00:34:08,489 --> 00:34:09,639
But there's one thing I don't understand.

571
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,699
Why are you trying so hard

572
00:34:12,730 --> 00:34:14,090
to go after these rebels of Lingyuan?

573
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,179
Lingyuan's people are outrageous.

574
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,560
They disregard the law.

575
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,820
If we can get rid of this group of people

576
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:22,370
by ourselves,

577
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,500
we can bring peace to the people of Nandu.

578
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:27,219
Isn't this what Your Highness, Magistrate Shao

579
00:34:27,980 --> 00:34:30,550
and Prince Fu want to see?

580
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,540
Indeed.

581
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,620
If Father knows the rebels of Lingyuan

582
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,780
are still secretly hiding in Nandu,

583
00:34:35,969 --> 00:34:36,969
he would investigate it thoroughly as well.

584
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,040
But you have no evidence.

585
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,980
How can I trust you?

586
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,889
I don't have solid evidence yet,

587
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,580
but I've already set up a bait.

588
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,090
This can't be delayed.

589
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,600
Would you like to arrest the suspect

590
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,570
with me?

591
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:57,720
What exactly is the bait?

592
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:39,970
Someone asked me to save you.

593
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:42,900
It's Kou Yuanjie.

594
00:35:44,660 --> 00:35:45,230
He's back.

595
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:58,510
That's right.

596
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,710
I might be using you.

597
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:12,780
You're not afraid of death.

598
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:15,170
I'm giving you a chance to live.

599
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,810
Don't tell me you don't want it.

600
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,430
He's been waiting for you.

601
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,440
He asked you to wear this cloak.

602
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:34,820
I only bribed the guards.

603
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,590
The rest is up to you.

604
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:48,490
[Shao's Residence]

605
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,100
Keep the meat away

606
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,340
so that he won't eat too much again.

607
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,200
You should leave a space in the center.

608
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:04,550
It's for the drunken crab.

609
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,900
It's Father's favorite.

610
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:06,730
Yes, Your Highness.

611
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,420
By the way,

612
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,330
the wine is a bit cold.

613
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,780
Father has a poor stomach.

614
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,100
He needs to drink something warm.

615
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:12,980
Yes, Your Highness.

616
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,250
I’m very sorry.

617
00:37:20,490 --> 00:37:21,840
-I bumped into the dish in her hand.
-I’m very sorry.

618
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,210
Prince Fu is here.

619
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,620
Mingzhu.

620
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,130
Mingzhu.

621
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:33,710
Where is she?

622
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:35,740
Mingzhu.

623
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,200
All right, get up.

624
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,190
No need for courtesy.

625
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,460
Get up.

626
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,320
[Prince Fu]

627
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:44,190
Father.

628
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:47,570
My daughter, come here.

629
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,960
Let me see if you've changed.

630
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,460
Father.

631
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,260
You finally came to see me.

632
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,180
Really?

633
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:54,900
Who wrote a fake letter

634
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,650
and sneaked away?

635
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,730
I'm fine,

636
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,040
other than missing you.

637
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,140
Okay.

638
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,140
Only Gongquan can grant you full autonomy

639
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,360
and take you to solve cases.

640
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,380
Share with me when you have time.

641
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,300
What trouble did you get into?

642
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,340
Father.

643
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,320
You know better than me about

644
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:13,870
what I did in Nandu.

645
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,790
You don't need me to tell you.

646
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,870
But I can tell you

647
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:20,370
about my progress recently.

648
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:23,380
It's great that you made progress.

649
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,380
I won't let you go until you finish.

650
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:26,710
What's going on?

651
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,030
Look.

652
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,780
Father, your favorite drunken crab.

653
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,070
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

654
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:33,860
It's all my fault.

655
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:34,590
Enough.

656
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,780
Don't think that the Prince

657
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:36,840
is as harsh as you think.

658
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,390
Right, Father?

659
00:38:37,530 --> 00:38:39,090
Yes. Get up.

660
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,130
It's okay.

661
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:41,480
Get up.

662
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:43,620
Get up.

663
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:47,360
Get up.

664
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,680
Clean it up.

665
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:50,060
Yes.

666
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:52,780
Isn't it settled now?

667
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,960
You like to meddle a lot.

668
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:56,080
Let me see what delicious food you prepared.

669
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,080
Let's see.

670
00:38:58,980 --> 00:38:59,460
How is it?

671
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:01,740
Aren't these your favorite?

672
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:03,910
It smells so good.

673
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:05,690
Father, have a seat.

674
00:39:06,430 --> 00:39:06,840
Here.

675
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:08,940
It's really good.

676
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:09,890
Father.

677
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,500
Beidu is good,

678
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,260
but it's not as good as the taste of our hometown.

679
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,060
Sit down.

680
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:18,340
Tell me about it.

681
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:21,180
Do you feel at ease staying here?

682
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,660
Yes.

683
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:23,940
Father, don't worry.

684
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:24,860
Father.

685
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,660
The dishes are getting cold. Hurry up and eat them.

686
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,200
Mingzhu.

687
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:29,620
Here's the thing.

688
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,960
I just arrived in Nandu today,

689
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:32,920
and accepted an invitation.

690
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,750
I do have something important to do.

691
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,160
I'd better eat with the others.

692
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,380
Father.

693
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,980
Who are they?

694
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:41,050
Sit down.

695
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,080
You're leaving before spending enough time with your daughter.

696
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,010
No, see.

697
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,740
I have something important to tell you.

698
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:47,820
It's just a friend,

699
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,140
who I haven't seen for a long time.

700
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:50,140
How about this?

701
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:51,740
Don't go there,

702
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:53,510
or take me with you.

703
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:54,400
No.

704
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,350
I do have something important to do.

705
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,140
Father.

706
00:39:58,290 --> 00:39:59,230
Let me go with you.

707
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,090
Fine. Fine. Fine.

708
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,460
I'll let you

709
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,780
come with me.

710
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,100
I think Gongquan

711
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:10,080
is probably hiding from your unruly temper.

712
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,270
Am I right? Right?

713
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,200
Father.

714
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,290
He doesn't need to go so far to hide from me.

715
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,720
He went to the east coast to investigate a case.

716
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,170
What's the case about?

717
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,610
I don't know.

718
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:25,490
Maybe it's related to the water ghost robbery.

719
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,030
But he can really live up to

720
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,260
his reputation of the Detective of Jiangnan.

721
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,190
He really can infer from the tiniest clue.

722
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:33,980
But Father,

723
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,440
have you been in touch with him lately?

724
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,760
I don't know what he's investigating.

725
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:41,550
He's an imperial guard.

726
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,780
I'm an idle prince.

727
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,180
Why would I have the time to ask him about it?

728
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,110
Let's go.

729
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,460
Let's go together.

730
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,980
Don't worry. I'm here.

731
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,170
It's okay. It's okay.

732
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,170
It's okay.

733
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,110
It's all in the past.

734
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,100
Yun Xiang told me

735
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,880
you would rather kill yourself than speak.

736
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,050
I didn't believe it at first.

737
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:07,130
Yuewu, why are you so foolish?

738
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,750
How could I not save you?

739
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:16,930
I know official soldiers are following you.

740
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:17,980
It's okay.

741
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:19,460
Have a seat.

742
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,900
Yuewu, you've suffered a lot.

743
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:31,020
Don't worry.

744
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,200
I have a well-prepared plan.

745
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,940
Listen to me carefully.

746
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:36,130
You will be safe tonight.

747
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,810
Do you remember the bank

748
00:42:41,450 --> 00:42:42,380
opposite to Guanghui Bank,

749
00:42:42,950 --> 00:42:44,590
called Dafeng Bank?

750
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,490
I ordered someone to establish it.

751
00:42:47,490 --> 00:42:49,490
Go there to avoid official soldiers.

752
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:51,570
Go to the second floor from the southeast corner.

753
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,020
Leave the rest to them.

754
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:22,730
Don't worry about me.

755
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,370
We'll meet outside the city tomorrow morning.

756
00:44:09,990 --> 00:44:11,790
Come, let's drink.

757
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:12,580
Come on.

758
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:20,020
Please.

759
00:44:31,090 --> 00:44:33,810
This must be Princess Mingzhu,

760
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:34,930
Prince Fu's daughter, right?

761
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:35,580
Yes.

762
00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,030
I heard that

763
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,700
Your Highness is gifted

764
00:44:40,150 --> 00:44:41,150
and gorgeous.

765
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,250
I didn’t expect that after seeing Your Highness today,

766
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,980
the rumor didn't even describe a fraction of your charm.

767
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:48,800
Mingzhu.

768
00:44:49,380 --> 00:44:50,780
Let me introduce.

769
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:54,380
This is Mr. Nangong.

770
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,390
Only a few people

771
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,380
can compete with him

772
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:03,180
in the business sector in Nandu.

773
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:07,380
He was my business friend.

774
00:45:07,640 --> 00:45:08,520
No wonder.

775
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,820
I prepared a table of delicious dishes.

776
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:13,020
Father turned them down.

777
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:17,700
But I'm more interested in

778
00:45:17,870 --> 00:45:18,750
the girl next to you.

779
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:23,340
What is the reason, Your Highness?

780
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:26,930
The hairpin on your hair is very exquisite.

781
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,850
I wonder where you got it from.

782
00:45:29,900 --> 00:45:31,140
It's just an ordinary object.

783
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:32,180
If you like it,

784
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:34,080
I can buy it for you next time.

785
00:45:35,950 --> 00:45:37,250
I’m sorry.

786
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:37,940
I didn't introduce her.

787
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:41,260
This is my right-hand man in Nandu.

788
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:43,610
Miss Kou, Kou Lianyi.

789
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:16,300
My lord.

790
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:17,460
it's time to close the net.

791
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,560
Yun Xiang is very suspicious.

792
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:24,190
What should we do?

793
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:26,760
Since Her Highness has agreed,

794
00:46:27,100 --> 00:46:28,310
just do as she said.

795
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:29,170
Yes, My lord.

796
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:46,830
Mr. Nangong,

797
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,660
arguably, I shouldn't question the sum of money

798
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:51,380
you have earned for me these years.

799
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:53,180
Why are Nangong Fang and Lady Kou here?

800
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:55,280
Isn't it a bit absurd for a bank

801
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,750
to give back interest?

802
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,990
Don't worry, Your Highness.

803
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,380
This is a trap for the enemy.

804
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,390
The business world is like a battlefield.

805
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:09,380
Who is it?

806
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:50,960
How dare you!

807
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:52,770
How dare you assassinate Prince Fu?

808
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:06,780
What is the bait you just mentioned?

809
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:09,420
The bait I mentioned

810
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:12,690
is the female bandit from Lingyuan.

811
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:21,540
Arrest them all!

812
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:22,700
Don't let anyone go!

813
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:30,590
Your Highness.

814
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:32,110
I'm late to the rescue.

815
00:48:32,230 --> 00:48:34,030
Death penalty!

816
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,100
Shao Yiheng.
