♫One journey, one glance, one thought about missing you♫

172
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,380
When you bought Liansheng House at the auction for Su Mingyu,

173
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,350
you knew this was going to happen.

174
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,000
To be honest,

175
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,880
I had already known when we first met in Yangzhou.

176
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,960
You have no grudge against the Su family.

177
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,750
Indeed.

178
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,980
It wasn’t raw silk that was destroyed,

179
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,690
but it was half of the Su family's lifeline.

180
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,140
The Su family has been prosperous for 100 years.

181
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:45,870
All good things must come to an end. It's the cycle of life.

Is this the righteousness of Yuntai?

183
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,980
A benevolent person may not look like one, and the greatest benevolence takes no sides.

184
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,290
Don't you dare talk about benevolence.

185
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,500
I've had enough of your dirty tricks.

186
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,180
You said you wanted revenge

187

and wanted to dissolve the Cao Sect within a month.

188
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:02,130
Now, only the Su family is falling apart.

189
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,080
Did you even put in any effort to deal with Qi Tianfeng?

190
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,860
If I can't even fool you,

191
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,170
how can I deal with Qi Tianfeng?

192
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,800
You must explain yourself clearly today.

193
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:12,620
Didn't we agree on the terms right at the start?

194
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,440
You will only execute and not ask questions.

195
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,050
You forgot about it so soon?

[The map of Yufeng Warehouse]

197
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:24,980
Set it on fire.

198
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:26,860
Are you crazy?

199
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,530
The Su family has never been our enemy.

200
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:31,380
What kind of conspiracy is this?

201
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,040
Look at the endless night.

202
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,080
Many homes may be lit up,

203
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:43,350
but we do not know how many families are happy and how many are sad.

204
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,860
Just like how you do not know me well,

205
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:52,370
my plan may not be a conspiracy.

206
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:54,240
Stop talking all these nonsense.

207
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,580
If you don't make it clear,

208
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,490
I won't go.

209
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,970
What did we promise before?

210
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,460
But this time, you went too far.

211
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,400
Fine, let me ask you.

212
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,810
Do you want revenge?

213
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:12,490
Do you want to kill Qi Tianfeng?

214
00:12:22,150 --> 00:12:24,320
If so, trust me.

215
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,950
Stop asking anymore.

216
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,130
I regret it.

217
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,940
You have such a temper.

218
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,420
I will be honest with you.

219
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,460
Not only did I not target the Su family,

220
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,080
but later,

221
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,660
I will be the only hope of the Su family.

222
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,320
Don't just talk about the Su family,

223
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,550
tell me how you plan to deal with Qi Tianfeng.

224
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,260
The marketplace is like a vast ocean.

225
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,520
Just a waft of the smell of blood

226
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,200
will attract a group of sharks to attack.

227
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,090
I've thrown the Su family down as the bait oozing with blood,

228
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,400
and the unknowing, evil shark that is about to swim here

229
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,820
is Qi Tianfeng.

230
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,650
When that happens, this dagger will stab through his head

231
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,120
instead of pointing at me.

232
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:29,670
Can you be more gentle next time?

233
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,160
I don't know how you are so willing.

234
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,260
Since it's a group of sharks,

235
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,220
Qi Tianfeng may not be the one who takes the bait.

236
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,730
Oh, I will consider you smart.

237
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,550
That’s why I tied myself up with the Su family.

238
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,850
On one hand, I’m a thorn in the flesh.

239
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,960
On the other hand, the Su family presents itself as an attractive piece of meat.

240
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,560
Qi Tianfeng will be more aggressive than anyone else

241
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,450
as he gets to kill two birds with one stone.

242
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,820
You're talking your head off.

243
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,730
You should be careful as you might get eaten up too.

244
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:54,820
Will you save me?

Get in.

249

as a form of my apology.

255
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,250
What did you do wrong?

256
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,220
I made a beauty angry. That is an unforgivable sin.

257
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,240
The background of the swordsman surnamed Jin is clean.

258

Where is this girl from?

259
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,620
Mr. Mo, since you've checked,

260
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,050
you must know more than me.

261
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,880
She should be the orphan of Shu family's armed escort agency.

00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:29,820
Wen Cong took her in as his adopted daughter.

263

Shu Yanan is the exception.

269
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:53,850
There is no way to verify her identity as an orphan of the Shu family.

270
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,800
Why? You also suspect her?

271
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,370
I'm a little worried,

272
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:04,230
but I haven't see any flaws.

273
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,230
Why don't you keep an eye on her for me?

274
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,500
Help you?

275
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,400
I think she should have sliced you by your neck.

What are you doing?

277
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:23,420
You told me not to meet you before I clear the accounts.

278
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,660
Now, you are inviting me personally.

are you feeling better?

283
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,750
I was about to ask you.

284
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:41,950
Are you hurt?

285
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,050
Sister, I'm fine.

someone set this fire on purpose.

If so,

when we were previously clearing the corpses of the thieves

294

who were involved in the highway robbery,

Mr. Yun said they appeared to be members of the Cao Sect.

296
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:14,839
If

297
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:17,619
the Cao Sect really wants to be our enemy,

298
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,619
it makes sense for them to set fire and burn the raw silk.

299
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:24,500
Don’t jump to conclusions.

300
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:28,730
I just don't know how trustworthy Mr. Xiang is.

301
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,170
I'm not sure either.

302
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,070
I don’t even know whether he’s a friend or foe.

303
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,080
But why would the Cao Sect  make things difficult for us, the Su family?

304
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:42,790
Anyone who is ambitious will be competitive.

305
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:44,760
It is not unusual

306
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,220
to kill or be killed when doing business.

307
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,740
But there is also a rumor spreading around

308
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,490
saying that it was Tang Xiao who set the fire.

309
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,050
He said he wanted to see me?

310
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:58,660

we've been waiting for half an hour.

Exactly what is keeping Mr. Tang up?

Well...

I will trouble the both of you to wait a while more.

Goodbye.

324
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:49,420
I think they are making us wait on purpose.

Ding Yi,

326
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:55,970
what do you think of this piece of land?

It's good.

328
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,810
I am just afraid that you try your best,

only to reap 20 to 30% in yield.

330
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,760
It's not worth it.

331

Water flows where land is low.

332
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:11,120
It doesn't matter if it's just 20 to 30%,

348
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:57,150
Why not?

Besides, I've been practicing martial arts for years.

00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,500
or the head of the Su family,

367
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,710
would you guys have been officially together

368
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,080
for a long time by now?

369
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,390
My sister's suggestion

370
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,330
seems to resolve the obstacles between me and Menglan.

371
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,450
But if one day I become the Chairman,

372
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,600
and I become the head of the Su family,

373
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,750
I’m afraid I will be left with very little choice.

374
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,760
Uncle Qian,

375
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,030
I don’t want to end up like you guys.

376
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:21,770
Mr. Qi! Mr. Qi!

377
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,690
Sorry to keep you waiting.

378
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,810
Sorry to keep you waiting!

379
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,510
Things are just as you wished.

380
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:33,230
What did I say? The older one is still the wiser one.

381
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,110
This big fire at Yufeng Warehouse

382
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,070
can only be described with one word,

383
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:39,300
and that is, "wonderful!"

384
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:40,960
This big fire

385
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,030
was not set off by us, right?

386
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:46,870
Well if not, was it me?

387
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,510
Well, I'm afraid everyone in Nandu knows that

388
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,590
Mr. Su had no foresight and

389
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:56,520
took a slice of your pie.

390
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,820
Are you here today

391
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:08,350
just to frame me?

392
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,980
It's okay.

393
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,600
Let's get down to business.

394
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,650
You bought such a big piece of land.

395
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:21,500
Mr. Qi, you deserve a great deal of credit.

396
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,570
I thought about it all night.

397
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:28,340
I think this plot of land across the street has a good location.

398
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:30,040
I'll give it to you.

399
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,700
You can sit back and enjoy the benefits,

400
00:22:39,890 --> 00:22:41,590
but it should be convenient for us.

401
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:47,270
Well, I came up with the money and the idea.

402
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:51,060
You are just a follower. What kind of convenience are you asking for?

403
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,750
Fifty-fifty. That will be fair.

404
00:22:55,490 --> 00:22:56,890
Now that you have said so,

405
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:59,470
I might as well say a few words more.

406
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,030
Qi Tianfeng,

407
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,800
do you know how much trouble you've caused me?

408
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,220
I asked you to kill Wen Cong but you didn't.

409
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:06,520
You insisted on keeping him.

410
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,860
Well, that's great because now,

411
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,690
the people from Yuntai have found their way here.

412
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:11,080
Mr. Xiang and the Su family

413
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,720
are working together as one against me.

414
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:14,570
Do you know why I don't want to see you?

415
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,390
I am so annoyed when I see you now.

416
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,920
How dare you even talk to me about your covenience?

417
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,980
Qi Tianfeng, Qi Tianfeng,

418
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,700
you sure have your ways to even drive the heaven crazy.

419
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,900
If you just have a little conscience left,

420
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,860
you can touch it and ask yourself.

421
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:33,080
Is there anyone else in Nandu

422
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,100
who dares to work with you?

423
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:38,220
Who doesn't know that you, Qi Tianfeng,

424
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,750
are just a traitor who betrays others?

425
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,010
- What are you doing?
- Your Master?

426
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,270
The Cao Sect and the Tang family

427
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:55,140
have always been allies.

428
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,140
Why don't we each take a step back?

429
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,980
We just want 20% of the land that is near the water.

430
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:01,530
What do you think?

431
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,240
Drop the idea of wanting any piece of land.

432
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:15,700
Mr. Tang, I see you are ready to take things to the extreme?

433
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,740
Since we are allies,

434
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:19,290
why should I make things difficult for everybody?

435
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,180
I have a brilliant plan.

436
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:23,680
Let me tell you about it.

437
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:26,990
Right now, the various industries in Nandu

438
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,360
are all industry leaders across Jiangnan.

439
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,200
But just one thing is missing.

440
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,130
A brothel.

441
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,880
I want to turn this body of water

442
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,270
into a tender place of sumptuous entertainment,

443
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,230
and create an unforgettable wonderland

444
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:45,520
for all men in the world.

445
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:49,500
So I ask, how can we make money without water?

446
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,430
Mr. Tang,

447
00:24:52,310 --> 00:24:54,880
the Chamber of Commerce doesn't allow us to do such business.

448
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,470
That's why I said your boss set the fire well.

449
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,610
Now, Ms. Su

450
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,220
must be hard pressed from the destruction of the fire.

451
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,220
Half of her body is already in the coffin.

452
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,080
If I don't take advantage of her now,

453
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:12,490
she will have to marry me in order to thank me.

454
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,090
Mr. Tang has a grand vision.

455
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,870
We should be supporting you.

456
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,630
How about this?

457
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:31,530
If you can convert the land that should be given to us into cash,

458
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,630
I will consider us even.

459
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:37,690
What do you think?

460
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,620
You want cash and not the land?

461
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:43,610
That's right.

462
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,110
Your Master!

463
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:44,790
Deal.

464
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,140
Deal.

465
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,540
Mr. Tang, you have many highly capable aides.

466
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,110
It shouldn't be a problem

467
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,680
to take out the two people surrounding Mr. Xiang, right?

468
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,620
We are indeed allies

469
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,800
as we are all thinking about the same thing.

470
00:26:08,370 --> 00:26:09,590
I will consider those two damned people

471
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,520
as free gifts from buying the land.

472
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:18,120
Let me ask you, what is Yuntai?

473
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,090
All wisdom and karma are caused by Yuntai.

474
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,000
The people of Yuntai abandoned the mortal heart

475
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,740
to embrace the Yuntai heart.

476
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,460
Because the mortal heart will decay,

477
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,530
while Yuntai has a heart for the people, the society,

478
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,290
and the world.

479
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,970
What is a mortal heart?

480
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,630
Although people are the foundation of wisdom,

481
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,430
they are often trapped in worldly affairs.

482
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:43,780
And the most passionate things in this world

483
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:48,620
are love and hate.

484
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,780
Love dazzles,

485
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,720
while hate messes with the heart.

486
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,510
As emotions intertwine,

487
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,460
it is unavoidable to close off one's ears and eyes.

488
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:00,800
Without wisdom,

489
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:05,660
there will be no world in one's heart.

490
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:10,670
You know clearly what's in your mind, but you still knowingly broke the rules.

491
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,830
I didn't.

492
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,590
No?

493
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:16,780
I ordered you to have jurisdiction over Yuezhou,

494
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,850
but you entered Nandu without permission instead.

495
00:27:24,850 --> 00:27:25,450
Yun Xiang,

496
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:29,540
we have our plans within the sect to deal with Wen Cong.

497
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:31,620
It’s none of your business.

498
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:35,160
You saved my life.

499
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,930
I can’t be ungrateful.

500
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:41,170
If you have yet to break away from your mortal heart, you cannot enter Yuntai.

501
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,060
Since you still have a mortal heart,

502
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:46,410
you shall return to the mountains and restart your cultivation.

503
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,820
Once the mortal heart is broken,

504
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,700
one will never understand the desires of the people,

505
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,550
nor understand love and hate.

506
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,590
Who are we then, to talk about benefiting the people and the society?

507
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:04,260
I thought people who enter Yuntai should have a mortal heart,

508
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,840
but not be trapped by the mortal heart.

509
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,620
What a sophistry.

510
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,270
Actually, I came to Nandu

511
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,230
not just for revenge,

512
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,650
but to settle unfinished matters for you.

513
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,700
Wen Cong is more than a genius.

514
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,020
How can you accomplish what he couldn't?

515
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:24,730
To be honest,

516
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,540
I have a 50% chance of winning.

517
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:29,390
50%? Then that's a bet.

518
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:32,180
Yuntai's technique is one that is full of surprises and risks.

519
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:33,730
My plan is already in motion.

520
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,470
If we stop now,

521
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,530
I'm afraid our sect will reap no benefits and instead, it will bring about much harm.

522
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:41,570
Besides, I have no roots

523
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:42,810
nor have anything that I am concerned about.

524
00:28:43,670 --> 00:28:44,460
Even if I lose,

525
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,460
I won't drag the sect down.

526
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,180
You want them to fight against each other and then take advantage of it?

527
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:51,760
Yes,

528
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:53,570
or not?

529
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,740
It seems like you have mastered it.

530
00:28:58,110 --> 00:28:59,390
You even posed me a question as your Master.

531
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,090
I dare not.

532
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:02,650
Forget it.

533
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,970
It's up to you this time.

534
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:07,800
Let's see how you can control the business of Nandu

535
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,470
with your bare hands.

536
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,160
But don't be blinded by a single leaf

537
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,590
and forget your mission.

538
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:15,190
Remember,

539
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,180
what Qi Tianfeng did is not worth mentioning.

540
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,740
The real obstacle is the Nandu Chamber of Commerce.

541
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,740
It's the Su family.

542
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:24,460
Yes.

543
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,700
I will live up to my mission and not let you down.

544
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,210
Direct disciples are sure different.

545
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,380
How dare you talk back to the Master?

546
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,030
You heard it?

547
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,690
Master only said that he didn't want to see me.

548
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,060
I thought there's no harm listening in.

549
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,580
I thought I could kick you out of Nandu,

550
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:01,730
but now I can't.

551
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,220
The cash cow

552
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,970
has grown right in front of Guanghui Bank.

553
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:07,370
Are you willing to pull it out?

554
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:11,150
I shouldn't have allowed you to borrow money with heavy interest back then.

555
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,240
Without that 3,000 taels,

556
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,960
I'll see how you can get close to Su Mingyu.

557
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,620
Anyway,

558
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,950
the Su family's fire is indeed strange.

559
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:24,720
Does this mean you have a new idea?

560
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,660
I've been working with Tang Xiao and Qi Tianfeng for years.

561
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:29,330
But this is the first time

562
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:30,860
I have seen such an underhanded approach.

563
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:36,250
It's all because of you.

564
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:38,580
You've made a mess in Nandu the minute you entered.

565
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,000
These two chaps are now impatient.

566
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:41,780
I'm flattered.

567
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,650
Uncle, let's talk somewhere else.

568
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,040
Don't disturb the Master.

569
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,300
Your Master,

570
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,240
by changing the land into cash,

571
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,980
we will lose everything.

572
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,910
Besides, Tang Xiao now thinks we have a shallow vision,

573
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,540
and will definitely be more savage in the future.

574
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:06,050
Your Master, do you have other plans?

575
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,470
We indeed have to change.

576
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,140
Instead of the small profits from those plots of land,

577
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,530
what I want is actually

578
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,250
all of Su family's assets.

579
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:26,860
Look.

580
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,420
Why did Yun Xiang seek out the Su family?

581
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:32,570
Because that family is rich.

582
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,130
But the fire has left

583
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,470
the Su family barely alive.

584
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:40,940
If we take down the Su family,

585
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:42,980
we'll also take down Yun Xiang's pillar of support.

586
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,040
We are killing two birds with one stone.

587
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,260
But the Su Family only lost some raw silk.

588
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,260
There are plenty of silk shops in Yangzhou.

589
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,670
They can just transport them again.

590
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,060
That's why

591
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:54,460
the lifeline of the Su family

592
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,020
is now firmly in our hands.

593
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,900
Are you saying that to ship the silk from Yangzhou to Nandu,

594
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,790
they have to go through our Cao Sect?

595
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,140
Of course.

596
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,300
If raw silk can’t enter Nandu,

597
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:09,660
the Su Family can’t deliver on the tributary cloth.

598
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:10,930
Also,

599
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:13,570
all the silk merchants in the Nandu

600
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,330
will be in utter chaos.

601
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,500
Your Master, in this way,

602
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:20,270
we’ll become complete enemies with the Su family.

603
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,480
A thick skin is meant for others to see.

604
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,220
You have to tear it when you need to.

605
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:35,650
That spy just now

606
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,140
just happened to be the Master's bodyguard.

607
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,900
If it was a spy that you and I brought with us

608
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,000
and exposed our Master's identity,

609
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,400
both of us will be executed.

610
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,290
Don't worry.

611
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,590
Our Master has been in charge of Yuntai for over 20 years.

612
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,760
No one has seen his actual face.

613
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,780
Not even you?

614
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,240
I've been cultivating for 15 odd years,

615
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,670
and I have only heard his voice.

616
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:56,070
Let's get down to business.

617
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:57,930
Based on what Master said just now,

618
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,400
besides dealing with Qi Tianfeng,

619
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,180
he also wants to destroy the Su family.

620
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:01,820
That’s right.

621
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:03,590
What's your plan?

622
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,660
Since it's the Master's order,

623
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,010
I'll follow it.

624
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:09,350
Unlike you,

625
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,140
who doesn't follow the ways of Yuntai

626
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,460
and only think about your own happiness.

627
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,760
Watch your mouth.

628
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:15,740
What did I say wrong?

629
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,520
What do you people who cultivate deep in the mountains know?

630
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,180
Seven years ago when Sinan Mansion encountered a locust attack

631
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,080
and had no harvest,

632
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,120
who was it who sent seeds for the next spring?

633
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,590
Four years ago, there was a drought at the De'an Mansion,

634
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,080
and the disaster relief grains were embezzled by dirty officials.

635
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:33,570
Yet, not a single one of them in the mansion starved to death.

636
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,500
Were the grains given by the Lord of the Land?

637
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,090
Two years ago when the dike breached at Anqing Mansion,

638
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,150
a hundred or so pirate speedboats came to save the people.

639
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,720
Did the money to hire the speedboats fall from heaven?

640
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:44,820
Mr. Mo,

641
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:47,130
I didn't expect you to have a way with the pirates.

642
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,460
I did all of these.

643
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:49,620
What did that Wen Cong do?

644
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,280
If I don't earn enough money for myself,

645
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:52,940
how can I save those victims?

646
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,330
I had a momentary lapse in my speech.

647
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,200
Please forgive me.

648
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,530
Actually, I've been thinking about

649
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,400
something you previously said to me.

650
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,080
The business in Nandu

651
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,790
should be controlled by the merchants of Nandu.

652
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:11,889
Don't beat around the bush.

653
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,480
Our Master has his orders.

654
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:15,969
I have my difficulties too.

655
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:19,239
If I don't get the Su family through this crisis,

656
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:21,960
there will not be money for me to seize.

657
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,760
You just said you'd obey the Master's order.

658
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:28,810
I believe you must have let out the secret

659
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,949
in order for Master to personally come to Nandu to find me.

660
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,090
If I don't know what you really think,

661
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:37,620
how would I dare to be honest with you?

662
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,219
That makes sense.

663
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,350
In that case,

664
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,440
let's wipe out the Cao Sect first then support the Su family,

665
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:48,810
and return the business of Nandu to the Nandu merchants.

666
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:49,460
What do you think?

667
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:17,780
If you're my fellow apprentice, just tell me your name.

668
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:22,050
If you're an outsider, prepare to die.

669
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:00,670
Red Dragon?

670
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,290
I even thought

671
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,390
our Master was holding a grudge against me,

672
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,590
and sent you to investigate me.

673
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,220
In ancient times, when Wu and Yue were in the same boat,

674
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:16,940
it was only when they encountered strong winds that they helped each other.

675
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:20,200
You and I aren't as bad as we thought, just like the Wu and Yue people.

676
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,260
Why don't we work together

677
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:23,630
and get what we each want?

678
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,060
Well, tell me how you intend for us to work together?

679
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,610
Uncle Mo.

680
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,160
Uncle.

681
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:30,580
You...

682
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,350
You fought that spy?

683
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,340
I'm fine. I've used the antidote.

684
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,070
He was hit by me over here too.

685
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:36,860
That will be enough for him to bear.

686
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:37,970
Did you see his face?

687
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,120
No.

688
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:40,860
The person has a light stature

689
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,500
but he's extremely powerful.

690
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:43,500
It's rare.

691
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,100
I've been in Nandu for more than 20 years

692
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,460
and I've never encountered such trouble.

693
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,580
You must have attracted him here.

694
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,620
Let's go home.

695
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:51,630
Mr. Mo!

696
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:52,630
Don't follow me.

697
00:37:29,930 --> 00:37:31,370
Jin! Jin!

698
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,450
Jin, wake up!

699
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,490
Jin! Jin!

700
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,230
- Tianhu?
- Mr. Jin!

701
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,170
What's wrong?

702
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:44,260
Let's go, Jin.

703
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,120
Sister is in danger.

704
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:46,450
Tang Xiao is here.

705
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,820
Liansheng House has just changed hands.

706
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:39,460
We are not open today.

707
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,020
Please come another day.

708
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:46,860
Sure.

709
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,370
Are you going to follow me on your own

710
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,360
or are you going to let Meizhu help you?

711
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,850
Menglan is the head dealer at Liansheng House.

712
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,630
If I want to go to the Tang's Gambling House,

713
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,420
I will need to discuss with my owner.

714
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,030
Your owners have no time for you.

715
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,320
Liansheng House will be out of business soon.

716
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,010
What kind of achievement can you get

717
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,380
by staying here as the head dealer?

718
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,370
Come over to my place.

719
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:28,660
I recently opened a brothel.

720
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,100
Get used to it for a few days,

721
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,260
and be immediately promoted to the top.
