You know how to wash your clothes too?

6
00:01:58,550 --> 00:01:59,740
I'm not familiar with the servants here.

7
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:00,750
I'm not comfortable letting others wash my clothes.

8
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,250
We've left home. Why are you still so particular?

9
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,830
It's just a few inches of shabby cloth to protect from the cold.

10
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,870
The rest is,

11
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,380

13
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,120
Is it made of gold?

14
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:15,350
Gold?

15
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,340
How can gold compare to this Yulan magnolia?

16

Take the last words of our names, Su Mingyu and Ke Menglan,

19
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:26,550
and you get this flower, Yulan magnolia.

20
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,550
Miss Menglan gave this to me.

21
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,150
Fine.

23
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,290

-It doesn’t matter what it's called.

61
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,390
The deed costs 4 taels and 2 coins.

62
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,660
It’s 9 coins higher than yesterday's price.

63
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,020
The price of raw silk has reduced by 2 coins.

64
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:16,140
In that case, the deed's price actually

65
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,990
increased by 1 tael and 1 coin.

66
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,930
Miss, what are you calculating?

67
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,270
I’m calculating the probability of the Su family's success.

68
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,710
If the deed follows the loss ratio of raw silk,

69
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,750
deducting one catty by two taels of silver per catty...

70
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:35,230
40,000 taels?

71
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,150
Then wouldn't 80,000 taels be 360,000 taels of gold?

74
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,270
I wouldn't have the energy to think about these.

75
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:50,430
Right now, the fall in the price of raw silk is obvious.

76
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,790
The upward trend of the price of the deed...

77
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,230

81
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,850
I heard you are proficient in business.

82
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,640
So, tell me

83
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,230
how much this deed for 80,000 catties of raw silk

84
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,380
can lower the price of Nandu's silk by.

85
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,250
Right now, compared to the deed,

86
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:25,150
actual goods are more reassuring to the merchants.

87
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,880
So I guess the market price of raw silk will drop.

88
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,750
It could drop down to 4 taels of silver per catty.

89
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:39,860
I estimate a drop of at most 4 taels and 5 coins.

90
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:43,130
Chairman Su, have you hedged your bets?

91
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:44,909
Hedged my bets?

92
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:47,390
Right now, the deed's price is on a rapid upward trend.

93
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,159
I'm guessing Chairman Su is also involved.

94
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,350
With the solid foundation of the Su family,

95
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,730
if you resell secretly,

96
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,880
it won’t be difficult to earn over 100,000.

97
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,470
If raw silk can’t enter the city

98
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:01,290
and you need to make compensations,

99
00:06:01,990 --> 00:06:03,470
they will be meager.

100
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:05,470
Chairman Su is Nandu Chamber of Commerce's supervisor.

101
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,470
The deeds are issued by the Chamber of Commerce.

102
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,530
How could the Su family get involved in embezzlement

103
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:10,900
by contributing to the rise of the deed's price?

104
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,530
I've overstepped my bounds.

105
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,230
I shouldn't have speculated without authorization.

106
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,390
What Mr. Qian said is true.

107
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,920
Even if I want to do it,

108
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:23,210
it's not the right thing to do.

109
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:26,110
Miss Ke is so familiar with business.

110
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:28,910
I'm really surprised.

111
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,970
I'm flattered, Chairman Su.

112
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,040
My knowledge is shallow.

113
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:37,400
All right, enough about this.

114

One is seriously injured.

133
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,710

140

I will never forget this.

141
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,039
The situation is clear now.

142
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,950
You might as well tell us your identities

143
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,590
and who the mastermind is.

144
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,280
Then, we might spare your lives.

Which one do you think will give in first?

148
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:00,990
I think so too.

149
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,800
Do you want to tell me now

150
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,210
or after I beat you up?

151
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,430
I’ll tell you now.

152
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,850

Fifteen villages, about 400 people,

and dozens from Cao Sect.

161
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,650
He's bluffing.

162
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,520
If they had 400 people, why didn't they come together in full force?

163
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,260
Why did they just send a few men?

164
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,320
It's not unusual.

165
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,590

167
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,730
It's unchivalrous to kill those in captive.

If you fall into his hands,

169

do you think he'll let you go?

170

Let's keep him as a witness and bring him back to the government office.

171

You can even use him to convict Qi Tianfeng.

172
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:07,590
Fine.

173
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,710
We can also use him as a hostage.

For now, lock him up and watch him closely.

176
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,340
No.

00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,890
Let me go.

178

Let me go.

179
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,710
Got it?

180
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,670
There's only one way to treat these people.

Since we're like family, the tuition fee is half-price.

Put down the knife!

Master Qi,

187
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,370
I, Wu Laosan, will be your brother in my next life!

188
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,210
Is this the martial world you've been

189
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,610
dying to explore?

190
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:18,820
Let's go.

191
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,360
It seems like only ashes are left,

192
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,160
but they're actually marking another beginning.

193
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,750
Chief Armed Escort Wang, you're back.

194
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,540
Mr. Jin.

195
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:04,710
We're back from exploring the route.

196
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,470
How's the situation?

197
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,320
Look.

198
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,300
The journey tomorrow will be treacherous.

199
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,500
Look here, and here.

200
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:12,510
These terrains make it easy for ambush.

201
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,750
There are at least seven or eight routes like this.

202
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,420
But we don't have enough men

203
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:17,520
to break through the defense.

204
00:12:18,410 --> 00:12:19,010
Let me have a look.

205
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:24,980
Be alert!

206
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,110
He has already used several methods

207
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,950
to deceive us thrice,

208
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,720
in order to make us restless.

209
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:49,590
What kind of place is this?

210
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,600
It's a deserted relay house.

211
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,480
It's two hours away from here.

212
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,710
Are the exterior walls sturdy?

213
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:56,690
You'll have to make do with it.

214
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,140
Right now, we're under siege.

215
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,830
They're trying to exhaust us completely

216
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:02,820
before launching the main offense.

217
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,750
There's no tenable defense position we can take in this wilderness.

218
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,990
There's not a moment when we can be at rest.

219
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:06,860
At this rate,

220
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:08,870
their wishes will really come true.

221
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,850
Even if we hide in the relay station,

222
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,810
we're not much stronger.

223

Miss Shu.

224
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,460
There's only 15 days left on the deed.

225

We don't have much time left.

226
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,110
Don't worry. We'll make it.

Everyone,

228
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:22,070
let's stay up for another night.

229
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,750
We'll set off for the relay house at dawn.

230
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,330
Anyway, let's rest and reconsolidate first.

231
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,550
I'll make further arrangements later.

232

What are you worried about?

238
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,590
I just find it strange.

239
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,630
Even if something happened to Su’s group of traveling merchants,

240
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,010
someone would still escape and return.

241
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,590
How could there be no news?

Those who made contributions will get additional rewards.

In three days, the deed will expire.

Time is tight, and the bandits are strong.

If we just continue to deplete our resources,

272
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,180
we'll only stay at a disadvantage.

273
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:06,710
So instead of just defending,

274
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,470
why don't we lure the snake out of hiding

275
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:09,830

Once the battle begins,

282
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,180
one of us has to fight against four or five of them.

283
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,340
How can we withstand that?

284
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,240

If we're outnumbered,

why don't we separate them into groups

289
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,740
and break through them one by one?

290
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:32,900

by exchanging the clothing of half of the servants with half of the armed escorts'.

294
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,980
Then, we split our group into two.

295
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:43,310
It'll seem like we split up accordingly,

296
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:45,530
but in actuality, one group is full of servants

297
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,710
while the other group is full of armed escorts.

298
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,750
In this case, since our two groups will take separate routes,

299
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,630
our opponents will also have to split up to chase us.

00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:21,150
Jin.

366
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:23,140
Where is Miss Shu from?

367
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:24,470
Why do you ask?

368
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,990
I've seen many famous young people,

369
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:29,910
but this is my first time seeing

370
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,190
a strategist like her.

371
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,710
She began roaming the martial world at a young age.

372
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,590
If she wasn't ruthless, she wouldn't have survived until now.

373
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,720
But I've also just found out about

374
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,230
her knowledge on military tactics.

375
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:43,050
No wonder. Amazing.

376
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,330
In time, she'll surely become famous in the martial world.

377
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:28,400
Everyone, watch out!

378
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:45,060
Mr. Su! Mr. Su!

379
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:46,630
Chief Armed Escort Zheng.

380
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:47,630
Where are the others?

381
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,720
As instructed, upon attack,

382
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,980
we abandoned the freight wagon and ran away.

383
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:51,990
But those bandits didn't go back to help the other group.

384
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,360
They came after us instead.

385
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:55,230
I was afraid all the bandits would be led here,

386
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,700
so I asked everyone to disperse.

387
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,230
How many people were after you?

388
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:58,990
More than 20.

389
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:00,440
Finally, it's time.

390
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,520
Close the gates and trap them in.

391
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,110
Don't let anyone escape.

392
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,640
Drag him here!

393
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,330
Get up!

394
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,180
Please don't kill me.

395
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,180
Don't kill me.

396
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,640
How are you an armed escort when you're so afraid of death?

397
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:27,910
Exactly!

398
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:32,120
Which Armed Escort Agency are you from?

399
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,750
You're not an armed escort, right?

400
00:23:35,850 --> 00:23:37,000
I'm not.

401
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,860
I'm just a servant.

402
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:40,540
A servant?

403
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:47,980
Tell me!

404
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,980
Where is the raw silk?

405
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:51,550
They're all at the relay station.

406
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:25,630
Are you Su Mingyu, the Young Master of the Su family?

407
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,730
Interesting.

408
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,690
It's the first time I've seen a small group trapping in a larger group of opponents.

409
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,570
Let's find out

410
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:49,910
who's really being trapped in today.

411
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,500
Brave warrior,

412
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,220
may I have your name?

413
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,010
What are you up to?

414
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,930
I've robbed countless wealthy people.

415
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:01,550
No one has ever asked for my name.

416
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,710
According to the martial world's rules,

417
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,390
no matter if we're enemies or friends,

418
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,580
we should know each other's names.

419
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,230
You must have watched too many dramas.

420
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,870
Young Master Su, listen.

421
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,520
We came all the way here

422
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,660
just for raw silk,

423
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,860
not to hold you hostage.

424
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,020
It's out of the question if you want our raw silk.

425
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,910
Surrender now and your lives might be spared.

426
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,380
Keep the raw silk and hostage safe,

427
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:35,040
and kill off the rest!

428
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,860
He's even a martial artist.

429
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:19,270
The weirder the weapon, the faster he dies.

430
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:21,740
You're as blind as a bat!

431
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:23,780
Do you want to die?

432
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:51,900
Get them to stop if you want to live.

433
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,390
Mr. Su.

434
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:42,070
Come with me quickly.

435
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,240
Mr. Su! Mr. Su!

436
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:47,340
I'm not going anywhere!

437
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,630
Steward Qian repeatedly asked for me

438
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:49,810
to protect your life

439
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:50,940
even at the expense of the raw silk.

440
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,300
Raw silk is the lifeblood of our family!

441
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,870
Dear ancestors,

442
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:54,200
it was my incompetence

443
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,720
that put the Su family

444
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,870
and Mingyu's life in danger.

445
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,780
May the ancestors bless me

446
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,660
so I can draw an auspicious divination stick for our Su family.

447
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,940
The rain has come and gone, and there's still hopes to continue transportation.

448
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:19,860
The woman is fierce.

449
00:29:21,070 --> 00:29:21,910
The full moon is near,

450
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:24,670
yet the gentleman continues on. It's dangerous.

451
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,110
This is an ominous divination.

452
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,360
If you persist in your opinions,

453
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,310
I'm afraid there'll be a calamity.

454
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,190
If you want peace,

455
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,340
you must call for a ceasefire.

456
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,210
Zhou. Zhou!

457
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,710
Have you seen Shu?

458
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,680
No.

459
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:30,790
Shu Yanan!

460
00:30:43,470 --> 00:30:44,140
Shu Yanan!

461
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:51,390
Shu Yanan!

462
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:55,140
Shu Yanan!

463
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:09,560
"Ten Taels of Gold"!

464
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,030
I thought you were dead.

465
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,070
I was thinking about how

466
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,630
Yun Xiang would have to deduct my pay when we go back.

467
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,660
Let's go now.

468
00:31:17,390 --> 00:31:17,870
Where are we going?

469
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,230
Haven't we killed them all?

470
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,310
It's been several hours

471
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:21,960
but not one bandit has come as reinforcement.

472
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,930
I'm worried that they went directly to the relay house.

473
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:25,770
Su Mingyu.

474
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,640
Guard the walls!

475
00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:54,900
Yes.

476
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:55,590
Save whoever you can quickly.

477
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:55,950
Yes.

478
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:56,360
Yes.

479
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:06,250
It's us.

480
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,950
Miss Shu, you're finally here.

481
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,750
We followed the tail end when we retreated.

482
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,360
Two groups of bandits surged in, front and back.

483
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:14,580
Where is Su Mingyu?

484
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,300
On the second floor.

485
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:15,930
On the second floor.

486
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:27,820
Su Mingyu?

487
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,150
Su Mingyu! It's me!

488
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:38,960
He's killing on autopilot now.

489
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:01,990
Are you clear-headed now?

490
00:33:02,610 --> 00:33:03,450
Have you regained your senses?

491
00:33:04,910 --> 00:33:06,190
You've sort of had your first kill this time.

492
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:08,950
Have you counted? How many did you kill?

493
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,160
The flesh was peeled open.

494
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:19,110
It felt like the sword came to my hand.

495
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,470
Stabbed in until the bones were reached.

496
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,480
It felt like stabbing hard rocks.

497
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:28,990
The blood is hot when it sprays on your face.

498
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,260
I didn't like it.

499
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:34,910
Not at all.

500
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:36,950
This is normal.

501
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,340
You'll be fine after you've regained your senses.

502
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:43,130
Take a good rest for a while.

503
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:44,840
Leave everything to us.

504
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,360
They're here again!

505
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:39,810
Withstand the pressure!

506
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,060
Withstand the pressure!

507
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:42,980
Go! Go!

508
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:48,080
We can't withstand the pressure like this!

509
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,190
Hang in there for a while more!

510
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,530
Those who can move, get up!

511
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:53,929
We must protect the courtyard wall.

512
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,790
Yes.

513
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,350
Withstand the pressure!

514
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,060
The carriage is here!

515
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,230
Have you figured it out?

516
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,790
You're right.

517
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,950
This is the real martial world.

518
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,020
From now on, you are my brother.

519
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,430
The real martial world is full of bloodshed.

520
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:08,280
You have to kill to live.

521
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,330
Later, when we fight,

522
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,050
don't show any mercy.

523
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:13,410
Hang in there!

524
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,460
Withstand the pressure!

525
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,790
The lifeblood of my family!
