Don't worry.

5
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:06,930
I'll investigate the matter for you later

6
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:07,920
to see whether Sheriff Liu

7
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,750
perished on duty at the frontline at Fujian.

8
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,270
It's no use to identify the exploited ones.

9
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,540
I'm looking for the mastermind.

10
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,079
Then why are you leaving in a hurry?

11
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,380
Tang Xiao is cornered now.

12
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,340
Once you push him again,

13
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,600
he will surely tell the truth.

14
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,240
He has already pleaded guilty.

15
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,150
There's no need to interrogate him anymore.

16
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,829
If Tang Xiao had nothing to do with the case,

17
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:36,260
why would he know so much about the details?

18
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,760
Tang Xiao cares so much about Sheriff Liu

19
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,450
only because

20
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,430
he wants to do away with the witness.

21
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,220
Does that mean

22
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,430
Tang Xiao is the mastermind?

23
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,329
He is just a guard dog.

24
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,450
Did you keep him alive

25
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,440
to lure out the person behind him?

26
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,150
I shall not have the chance.

27
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,220
I think someone will shut him up soon.

28
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:05,820
Fine.

29
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:07,910
I'd give you the shirt off my back.

30
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,970
I'll ask the Shadowman to keep an eye on Tang Xiao.

31
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,420
Thank you, Mr. Mo.

32
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:20,510
Did you come back in a hurry

33
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,570
to confront the Su family?

34
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,940
At this point, I have no way back anymore.

35
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,480
I can only get to the bottom of the case

36
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:29,710
by investigating all the guilty ones.

37
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,500
With the benefit of hindsight,

38
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,329
the news of the Imperial Court unbanning on maritime trade

39
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,460
was indeed from Su Linghe.

40
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:38,700
That caused the dispute when purchasing land on the east coast.

41
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,960
But you've been supporting

42
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,270
the Su family with all your heart.

43
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,130
Do you really want to destroy it personally?

44
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,140
Whether it is destroyed or kept

45
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,520
depends on whether it is guilty or not.

46
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,980
You only care about the truth.

47
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,440

60

But if there were no justice in the world,

61
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,850
wouldn't it be even more absurd?

62
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:43,260
The world is full of absurdity from the very start.

63
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,370

64
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,620

You've been staring at it for a long time.

73
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,920
Your sword is worthless too.

74
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,920
This was left to me by my foster father.

75
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:02,460
This is also the only thing my mother gave me.

76
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:09,460

No.

Let's talk about us then.

Tang Xiao compensated me.

86
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,670
But then, Liansheng House utilized my money to make their accounts balanced.

87
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:51,580
What did I get in return after all of these?

88
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,600
I promised to give you all the Tang family's property.

89

90
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,440
Have you ever calculated how much money they are worth?

91
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,180
How can I get them? Tell me.

Do you need to report to Chairman Su?

No need.

117
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,450

I admire you very much for that.

128

It was impressive.

However, even if you have won,

130
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,170

Regarding this issue,

161
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,290
you have to ask your close friend,

162

the other owner of the Lianfang House, Su Mingyu.

163
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,930
You intend to find out the truth about the Luo family's village killings.

164
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,880
But before that, you will have

165

00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,160
Miss Su.

187
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,620
From the moment I burned the document,

188
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,440
I figured it out.

189
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:28,580
Rather than saying

190
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,600
I burned the chance for me to be unenslaved,

191
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:36,900
I'd say I burned

192
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,090
the shackles that had locked me up for years.

193
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,980
If I always feel inferior and humble,

194
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,350
even if I am unenslaved,

195
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:50,800
I will still be troubled because of being a sinner's daughter.

196
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:56,420
Sister,

197
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,410
without the document,

198
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,140
can't we really be together forever?

199
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,760
I have seen the prosperity of the world

200
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,770
and experienced the fickleness of human nature.

201
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,980
Now I just want to live in the present.

202
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,100
I don't want to leave any regrets in this life.

203
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,500
As for the legal status,

204
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,110
it doesn't matter to me.

205
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:44,590
I don't want it.

206
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:01,650
Since you don't care about

207
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,600
the common customs and the legislations,

208
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,580
I won't

209
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,060
make arrangements for your wedding then.

210
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,940
Thank you for fulfilling our wishes.

211
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,400
Thank you, miss.

212
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,300
Rong,

213
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,180
why were you in such a hurry?

214
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,090
When the Chamber of Commerce was closing,

215
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,660
Xiang suddenly came.

216
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,790
He insisted on reviewing the business deed files.

217
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,290
He requested to check on the files in the 24th year of Tianqing.

218
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,620
So what do you think

219
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,560
he is up to?

220
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:51,480
Rong.

221
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:55,570
The trend is changing like the tides.

222
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,630
If the Su family were no longer prosperous,

223
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,210
what would you think?

224
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,560
Open the door.

225
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,830
Hurry up!

226
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,510
Open the door!

227
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,120
Open the door!

228
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,980
Leave me alone. Close the door.

229
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,120
Close the door.

230
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:37,470
Mr. Tang is finally back.

231
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,020
You work for Mr. Ye?

232
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,070
Guess again.

233
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,350
Are you from that side?

234
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,120
Which side?

235
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:52,710
Why don't you just tell me your identity?

236
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,560
Why did you break into my mansion?

237
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:59,690
Mr. Tang, you've cooked the books, haven't you?

238
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:58,900
[Account Book]

239
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,830
Although I don't quite understand the content,

240
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,620
the texture of these account books is similar to the new ones.

241
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,490
I can smell the paper mulberry scent once I open them.

242
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,670
You didn't even tell me who you are.

243
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,700
Yet you are asking questions about this and that.

244
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,460
On what ground should I tell you?

245
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,140
Fine.

246
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,710
Tell him then.

247
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:25,840
Mr. Ye.

248
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,750
This is the young master of the Lingyuan Sect,

[The Young Master of the Lingyuan Sect, Kou Yuanjie]

250

251

Pardon my ignorance.

252
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:37,100
Greetings, Young Master.

253
00:19:37,470 --> 00:19:39,230
Now, tell me the whole story.

254
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,020
Why did you cook the books?

255
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,910
Don't be so aggressive.

256
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,520
All these years, Mr. Tang

257
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:51,260
has laundered that much money for the Lingyuan Sect.

258
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,940
He should be rewarded for his hard work.

259
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,140
Mr. Tang,

260
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,250
let me have a look at the treasure in your cellar.

261
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,500
Mr. Ye,

262
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:25,840
I've spent tens of years on the pharmacopoeia.

263
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,010
[Pharmacopoeia]

264
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:30,260
Every prescription inside has gone through multi-party verification.

265
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,050
It's really valuable.

266
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,960
I am honoured to present it to you and Young Master

267
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:37,870
as well as the Lingyuan Sect.

268
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,430
Every ingredient here is a rare treasure.

269
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,940
They are all priceless.

270
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,110
Mr. Tang,

271
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,420
how many tricks did you use

272
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:51,350
in the accounting

273
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,620
and how much money did you embezzle from the Lingyuan Sect

274
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,660
to get such an account book?

275
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,700
Mr. Ye.

276
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,780
At this point,

277
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:05,490
I d-don't dare to make such jokes.

278
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:09,880
Really?

279
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,270
Mr. Tang's collection

280
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,340
can already offset the interest.

281
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:37,730
It's more than enough.

282
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:40,760
Come here.

283
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,820

Please spare my life.

Tang Xiao.

287
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,170
Do you know what you did wrong?

288
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,020
Stealing money and cooking the books.

289
00:21:59,300 --> 00:21:59,650
No.

290
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,660
It's fine to embezzle money and cook the books,

291
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,870
but it's your fault for being discovered by me.

292
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,150
It's the same as you acted on your own

293

to deal with Xiang.

294
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,080
Your mistake was losing to him.

295
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,630
I've always been tolerant,

296
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:17,160
but I can't stand your failure.

297
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,300
I... I was wrong. I admit my mistakes.

298
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,470
Please.

299
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:24,280
Give me one last chance.

300
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,590
Fine.

301
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:27,500
I'll give you one chance.

302
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,020
Mr. Tang,

303
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,900
if you can't even defeat a few women,

304
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,550
you can't blame me for being merciless.

305
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:05,600
Mr. Mo has given an order.

306
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,520
Someone will visit Tang Xiao today.

Do keep an eye on him.

Do we have to keep Tang Xiao safe?

309
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,330
Tang Xiao's life is of no great importance.

310
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,650
You must pay attention to the visitors.

311

370
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,400
It is hot and humid.

371
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,550
You might be prone to lose your cool.

372
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,870
You'd better calm yourself down.

373
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,060
I don't need to calm down.

374
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,520
I want to take a drastic measure instead.

375
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:37,960
If too drastic,

376
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,670
it'll not only harm your enemy but also you yourself.

377
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:46,260
So it's not worth it.

378
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:48,100
You are not me.

379
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,100
How do you know whether it's worth it to me or not?

380
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:56,800
I have some past stories to discuss with Mr. Yun.

381
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,580
Go ahead. It's fine.

[Records of Land Purchase on the East Coast in the 24th year of Tianqing]

383
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:38,900
That's right.

384
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:41,430
As recorded in the file,

385
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,300
the Su family

386
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:47,040
caused the dispute about the land purchase on the east coast.

387
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,990
But back then, my late father

388
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,760
didn't do that for his own benefit.

389
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,080
He had no choice

390
00:28:55,170 --> 00:28:55,930
but to protect himself.

391
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,230
What do you mean?

392
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:00,680
In the 20th year of Tianqing,

393
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,770
Wen Cong barged into Nandu alone.

394
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,980
In just a few years, he created chaos

395
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,510
among the Nandu merchants with his own strength.

396
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,190
The rich merchants in Nandu were all defeated.

397
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,150
The Nandu Chamber of Commerce was nearly falling apart.

398
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:19,930
I knew about it already.

399
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,550
You only know the parts,

400
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,220
but not the whole.

401
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:29,830
Although Wen Cong is your senior,

402
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,540
he's very ruthless.

403
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,520
He insisted on defeating all merchants in Nandu

404
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,360
so that he could corner the market.

405
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,350
Mr. Yun,

406
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:44,570
I heard that Yuntai always sees it as your task to protect the people.

407
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,860
But didn't Wen Cong's doings

408
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,800
violate your rules?

409
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,940
Mr. Wen must have his own reason to do so.

410
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,580
Do you mean the Su family should just await our doom?

411
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:01,910
On April 20, the 24th year of Tianqing.

This is to certify that the following person has purchased a 120-acre land,

located at Qingfengpu on the east coast,

417
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,340
It's the name of my late father.

your father sold the land

to Liu Qi.

422
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:28,260
Liu Qi is also the owner of Zhaixing House.

423
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,660
According to Mr. Su,

424
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,950
your families have been friends for generations.

[Land Ownership Certificate]

429
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,430
at a high price of 5,200 taels.

430
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,430
The land property was sold twice within two months.

431
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,560
And the price tripled.

432
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,410
In this case, there is only one reason for that.

433
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,890
Your father spread the rumour

434
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:53,760
that the Imperial Court would unban the maritime trade on the east coast.

435
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,490
Then he quickly bought

436
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,900
a lot of land on the east coast at a low price.

437
00:30:58,250 --> 00:30:59,990
When Mr. Wen took action,

438
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:02,460
most of the properties along the coast had been purchased.

439
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,410
Under the circumstances,

440
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,230
he could only purchase the property from other merchants at a higher price

441
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,660
and hoped that land prices would keep rising.

442
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,200
So that he could get rid of it.

443
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:12,040
But during the spring of the next year,

444
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:14,620
the rumour about unbanning the maritime trade was no more tenable.

445
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,330
The land prices dropped drastically.

446
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:17,940
I did a rough calculation.

447
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,250
Mr. Wen lost about 200,000 taels in the incident.

448
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:23,640
After that incident,

449
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:26,980
he can no longer corner the market in Nandu

450
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,460
on his own.

451
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:33,180
But your Su family became famous because of that.

452
00:31:34,210 --> 00:31:35,140
Your father

453
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:38,570
even secured his position of being the Nandu Chamber of Commerce's chairman.

454
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,980
I won't deny what you said.

455
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:52,850
Mr. Qian.

456
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,950

It's noon already.

458
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,360
She'll get sick if she doesn't eat anything.

459
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,160
You may leave first.

460
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,440
Yes.

461
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:11,660
If Mr. Yun came back for revenge,

462
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,770
it'd be enough to punish someone and give a warning to others.

463
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,470
To punish who?

464
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:23,950
You?

465
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:27,540
Chairman Su,

466
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,310
are you trying to repent or threaten?

467
00:32:38,930 --> 00:32:40,540
I've admitted everything I should.

468
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,770
It's inevitable that we neglected something.

469
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,550
Let me help you recall.

470
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,490
On September 13, the 24th year of Tianqing,

471
00:32:54,410 --> 00:32:56,180
Tang Xiao bought a 207-acre land

472
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:59,030
from Jiangnan Administration Bureau.

473
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:00,430
On the third day of October,

474
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,290
he sold the property to Mr. Wen.

475
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:05,110
Chairman Su, do you remember?

476
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:09,720
Back then, we only bought one real estate from Jiangnan Administration Bureau,

477
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,150
which was the Luo family's village.

478
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,190
It was exactly Tang Xiao and Luo family's village

479
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,480
that you never spoke a word about.

480
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:21,960
It's written clearly on the land ownership certificate.

481
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:25,370
The deal was between Tang Xiao and Wen Cong.

482
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,580
It had nothing to do with the Su family.

483
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:32,830
Your father spread the rumour about the Imperial Court unbanning the maritime trade

484
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,650
and caused chaos in purchasing land on the east coast.

485
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:37,160
But your father didn't intend to defeat Mr. Wen,

486
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,460
but to make Mr. Wen

487
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,770
have no more chance to make a comeback in Nandu.

488
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:43,650
So in the second half of the game,

489
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:47,320
Tang Xiao became the best pawn.

490
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,470
At that time, coastal estates on the east coast

491
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,790
were traded frequently among merchants in Nandu.

492
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,390
But not even a few land ownership certificates

493
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,340
was with the name of Tang Xiao.

494
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,220
That caused the false appearance of

495
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,740
Tang Xiao having no agreement with the Su family.

496
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,290
That's why Mr. Wen let his guard down

497
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,920
and dared to cooperate with Tang Xiao.

498
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,650
Mr. Yun,

499
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,130
I'll say it again.

500
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,659
Tang Xiao has nothing to do with our Su family.

501
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:14,270
Next is the most brilliant

502
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,330
and the most vicious trick of your father.

503
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,090
There wasn't much real estate on the east coast.

504
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:22,659
The isolated Luo family's village was one of them.

505
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:26,300
Mr. Wen ordered Qi Tianfeng to purchase it.

506
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:27,360
But then,

507
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,989
someone proposed a plan to Mr. Wen,

508
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,840
saying that if he falsely accused the people,

509
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,770
he could bribe the soldiers to slaughter the villagers.

510
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:37,020
So that he could cut the cost of purchasing land.

511
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,920
That's how the murder of the Luo family's village happened.

512
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,650
And the person who came up with the plan

513
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,449
was Tang Xiao.

514
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:52,500
Tang Xiao was just the owner of a gambling house.

515
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,080
Even if he could

516
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:56,780
bribe Sheriff Liu and other soldiers to kill the villagers,

517
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:59,360
there was no way he could control the Imperial Court's order

518
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,380
and deploy them to the frontline of Fujian to eliminate the pirates.

519
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,620
Actually, it was to silence them.

520
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,240
But on the contrary, the Su family

521
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,710
had so much correlation with the Imperial Court.

522
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,340
It was a piece of cake

523
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,780
for you to do so.

524
00:35:12,290 --> 00:35:13,720
The truth is obvious to be known.

525
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,200
Do I need to explain further?

526
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,590
What is the truth

527
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,040
you're referring to?

528
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,400
The truth is

529
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,500
Mr. Wen was set up

530
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,180
and destroyed step by step.

531
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:30,690
In the end, he broke the rules of our sect and became greedy.

532
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,030
He also took the blame

533
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,920
for the murder of the Luo family's village alone.

534
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,350
He could only watch the Su family take over the Chamber of Commerce

535
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,730
and establish your foundation step by step.

536
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,850
As the mastermind behind all of this,

537
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,190
your father behaved in such an inhumane manner.

538
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,770
Wasn't he afraid of being slapped by evil spirits in the middle of the night?

539
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,370
Don't insult my father.

540
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:02,730
Since you entered the city,

541
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,080
I've always been kind to you.

542
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:07,370
Don't push your luck

543
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,690
and mistake me for being weak.

544
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:11,580
All the evidence

545
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:15,510
is in front of you.

546
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,210
Who benefited the most in the game?

547
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,410
It could only be the Su family

548
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,320
which is so influential that you can lose your conscience.

549
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:27,290
Xiang,

550
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,730
I think you're done with the Su family.

551
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,200
Please take your leave.

552
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:47,100
Who are you?

553
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,970
You can guess the answer.

554
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,740
Even if the Yuntai Sect is impeccable,

555
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,780
after all,

556
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,090
it's just a shady sect.

557
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,840
If there's one day we have a deadly duel,

558
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:19,510
I'll find a way to deal with them.

559
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,290
He's not from Yuntai.

560
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:27,800
He is from Luo's family village.

561
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:40,570
Xiaoyu,

562
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,600
when I grow up,

563
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,220
will I be as pretty as Miss Ke?

564
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:44,930
No, you won't.

565
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,340
Even so, I'm still prettier than you.

566
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,140
I don't care.

567
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:49,790
When I grow up,

568
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,900
I want to be a heroine like Miss Shu.

569
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,110
I don't need to be pretty.

570
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,900
You two go elsewhere to play.

571
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:07,090
Do you like kids very much?

572
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,530
Children are naive.

573
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:11,770
Everyone likes them.

574
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:16,090
But these two girls are so cunning.

575
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:18,650
I'm afraid they'll have bad habits

576
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,720
if they stay in Liansheng House for too long.

577
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:24,140
It's indeed not a long-term solution.

578
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:28,570
I've discussed this with Mingyu.

579
00:38:29,930 --> 00:38:32,290
The Su family still has an old house left unoccupied.

580
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:35,590
We plan to turn it into a charity hall.

581
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:37,820
That's great.

582
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,740
You always call him Mr. Su.

583
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,620
When did you start to call him Mingyu?

584
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,580
Tell me.

585
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:51,910
Are you two engaged in marriage without permission from your parents?

586
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,130
Su Mingyu is indeed reliable.

587
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,830
If he dares to betray you,

588
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,070
I'll break his legs.

589
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,770
Although I am reluctant for that,

590
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,760
we are family after this.

591
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:12,660
How about this?

592
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,420
Nothing here suits me.

593
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:18,020
No wonder men like you.

594
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:19,980
Even the kids say

595
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,300
I don't look like a girl.

596
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,070
Don't you have Mr. Yun?

597
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:26,090
He...

598
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,280
He didn't even inform me when he went out last night.

599
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:33,160
I still have no idea about where he is.

600
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,280
Your thoughts are still full of Mr. Yun every day.

601
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,080
Maybe you like him being that.

602
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:45,710
Maybe.

603
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,440
He is like a kite.

604
00:39:50,490 --> 00:39:52,270
If he landed on the ground,

605
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:53,760
there would be no point in that.

606
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:00,370
It's fine as long as the kite string

607
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:03,040
is always in your hands.

608
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:06,800
How about this?

609
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:13,770
Why don't I just take this?

610
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:16,510
No way.

611
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:19,570
This one.

612
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:21,920
It's elegant and neat.

613
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,890
Okay, I'll listen to you.

614
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:26,680
Okay.

615
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:30,630
The hairpin still doesn't work for me.

616
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,560
The silver colour shines at night.

617
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:33,970
It's so obvious that my whereabouts will be revealed.

618
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:37,500
Miss Shu, you aren't fighting all the time.

619
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,210
Miss.

620
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,010
The city gate is closed.

621
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,740
The vendors can't get in and the market is closed too.

622
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,920
I went out just now and couldn't buy anything.

623
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,270
The city is having a lockdown?

624
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:50,510
Why?

625
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,580
I don't know.

626
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,220
I just heard that some soldiers had gathered at the city gate.

627
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,420
When I came back,

628
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,860
I saw many patrolmen patrolling the streets.

629
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,260
We still have enough ingredients.

630
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:00,160
Let's go tomorrow.

631
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:01,780
Where is Ten Taels of Gold?

632
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:04,130
No idea.

633
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,080
We tried to match them together with good intentions.

634
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:12,140
But it turned out to be our wishful thinking.

635
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:16,290
Is this the first time Jin has been liked by a girl?

636
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:18,020
He needs to get used to it.

637
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,230
Is this his first time?

638
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:20,650
How would I know?

639
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:23,710
Is Yun Xiang back?

640
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:25,740
Where's Su Mingyu?

641
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,230
He went to the Weaving Division

642
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,070
for the tributary cloth.

643
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,220
Tang Xiao has sent the money here.

644
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:31,030
Let's go and pick it up.

645
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,340
Why are you standing there?

646
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:42,640
Are you reluctant to do so?

647
00:41:49,370 --> 00:41:49,840
Wait.

648
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,240
The money from the Tang's Gambling House

649
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,240
should be sent to Guanghui Bank first.

650
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:05,160
It doesn't matter.

651
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,140
Since the money is here,

652
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:07,940
let's keep it for now.

653
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,060
We'll deal with it when Yun Xiang comes back.

654
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,170
That's right.

655
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,150
Mr. Yun will handle it.

656
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,140
Miss, please don't make it difficult for us, the servants.

657
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:32,420
Wait.

658
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,140
Miss.

659
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:36,460
Did I say anything wrong?

660
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:39,370
Who is this hooligan?

661
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:40,910
Stay away from Liansheng House.

662
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:42,100
Girl.

663
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,540
What happened?

664
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:48,230
She has a bad temper.

665
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:52,010
People might think I'm not giving her money

666
00:42:52,650 --> 00:42:54,010
but something dirty.

667
00:42:54,810 --> 00:42:56,450
Liansheng House doesn't accept the money.

668
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:02,310
Girl...

669
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:04,150
Don't argue with me about this.

670
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,250
I'll explain this to Yun Xiang when he is back.

671
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:08,950
Miss.

672
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,060
I'm curious about

673
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:12,860
how you will explain it.

674
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,910
If you stay any longer,

675
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,350
you'll suffer the consequences.

676
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:27,420
Fine, I'll leave.

677
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:28,800
Let's go.

678
00:43:44,650 --> 00:43:46,780
Miss Shu, do you know this servant?

679
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,460
Tang Xiao is very cunning.

680
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,980
Don't get yourself into trouble.

681
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,700
What do you want to do in Nandu?

682
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:56,490
Long time no see, sister.
