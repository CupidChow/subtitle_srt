4
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,530
Who am I?

5
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:07,820
Master.

6
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:14,450
Heart Devouring Powder is such a good thing.

7
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:21,590
Sit.

8
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,360
Now that I look at you closely,

9
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,390
I have to say you're pretty.

10
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:53,890
It's a pity

11
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,200
that Yun Xiang got you before me.

12
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:13,530
I can do whatever I want with you now.

13
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,990
Although it's less fun,

14
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,280
when I think of Yun Xiang's face

15
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,980
when you meet him in disheveled clothes

16
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,020
after I get everything I want,

17
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:27,640
I'm filled with excitement.

18
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,779
I've had many enemies in my life.

19
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,170
None of them has ever underestimated me.

20
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,930
Where do you get the nerve to assassinate me?

21
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,440
No time for trash talk.

22
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:29,400
Get her!

23
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:28,840
Yuanjie.

24
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,920
Mother, leave this to me.

25
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,120
Keep yourself safe.

26
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:32,820
Stay out of it!

27
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,050
Even if it may cost me my life,

28
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,510
I won't allow anyone to mess with the Lingyuan Sect!

29
00:05:49,409 --> 00:05:50,340
Yuanjie!

30
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,690
You had lots of nerve

31
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,480
to poison a poison master.

32
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,490
This poison is called Hidden Cold Scale.

33
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,070
Whether you eat it or inhale it,

34
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,820
you'll stop breathing

35
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:45,700
as if you're dead.

36
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,030
Do you want to know

37
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,730
where you'll wake up in three days?

38
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,980
I'm itching to slice your throat now,

39
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,710
but you're still of use to me.

40
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,010
What you said just now disgusted me.

41
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:10,070
How should I teach you a lesson?

42
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,910
You're effeminate.

43
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:18,750
How about

44
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,660
I take something that you don't need?

45
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:48,210
Kou Yuanjie gave you the Heart Devouring Powder, right?

46
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,040
Mother, don't blame me.

47
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,800
They gave me no choice.

48
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:37,210
I wish I could gouge out my eyes.

49
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,930
I wasted my whole life

50
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,920
chasing fame

51
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,980
and didn't raise you well.

52
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,470
Mother.

53
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,450
I did it for the Lingyuan Sect.

54
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:37,250
Mother.

55
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:39,650
Mother!

56
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,000
Mother!

57
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,940
If Kou Lianyi finds out,

58
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,540
she won't let me get away with it.

59
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:00,850
She won't let me get away with it.

60
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,510
Master Kou, leave this place now.

61
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,940
I'll take care of the rest.

62
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,120
Mother.

63
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:40,980
Mother!

64
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:43,460
Mother.

65
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,580
Mother.

66
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,360
-Mother. -Both you and I are late.

67
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,450
Do you recognize this knife, Lady Kou?

68
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,200
Your brother has run away with the seal.

69
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:11,290
You saw through my plan last time.

70
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,000
I was so surprised.

71
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,270
Why don't you take a guess again?

72
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,380
What do you think I'll do next?

73
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,390
You'll tell all the branches of the Lingyuan Sect

74
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,600
to get prepared for wars

75
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,970
so that you can rise up when it's time.

76
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:33,370
Go on.

77
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,690
To the north of Yangzhou is the Central Plain.

78
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,320
Roads there lead everywhere.

79
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,610
So when the war starts, it'll definitely come under siege.

80
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,730
Nandu, on the contrary,

81
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,340
has the river as a natural barrier

82
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,830
and supplies are abundant.

83
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,000
So next, you'll

84
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,740
order the troops in Yangzhou

85
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,290
to cross the river and guard Nandu.

86
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,750
You'll be able to sustain a prolonged war and expand your reach.

87
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,510
Then what?

88
00:12:58,510 --> 00:12:59,450
I don't know.

89
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,030
You don't?

90
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:06,560
No.

91
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,220
You guessed right.

92
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,520
I'll go to Yangzhou to deploy the troops soon.

93
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,360
Come with me.

94
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,370
Prince Fu.

95
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,020
What's it?

96
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,670
Something happened to Mr. Nangong.

97
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,260
Where is Kou Yuanjie?

98
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,580
I couldn't find him anywhere.

99
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,570
I'm afraid he's run away.

100
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,760
It's the Kou family's family business that he killed his mother.

101
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:53,970
I won't interfere with it.

102
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,270
But Kou Lianyi

103
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,100
killed an important disciple of the Yuntai Sest.

104
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,690
That can't go unanswered.

105
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,070
Your disciple tried to poison me and assault me

106
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,700
when I came to meet him.

107
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,660
I don't think the Yuntai Sect needs a pest like him.

108
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,060
Yun Xiang.

109
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,510
Kou Lianyi killed your senior.

110
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,910
What should we do about her?

111
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,060
She should pay with her life.

112
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:30,780
But if Kou Lianyi dies,

113
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,400
Kou Yuanjie won't last long.

114
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:33,770
In that case,

115
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,950
the Lingyuan Sect will be left without a leader.

116
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,600
I'm afraid that would be a problem.

117
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,850
So you want me to let it slide?

118
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,550
I just don't want you to be seen as uncaring and reckless.

119
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:49,710
Kou Yuanjie is so ambitious.

120
00:14:50,450 --> 00:14:51,620
That's surprising.

121
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:53,400
Forget it.

122
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,020
Nangong Fang indulged in lust.

123
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,510
He violated the sect rules.

124
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,180
But given that he was a disciple of the Yuntai Sect,

125
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:05,190
let him be buried in the back mountain

126
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:06,450
with Mo Bufan and Kang Qiao.

127
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,100
Kou Lianyi, you have to know

128
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,450
that death is too severe a punishment for Nangong Fang.

129
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:21,280
What's done is done. I won't punish you.

130
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,590
If you see your brother after going back,

131
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:24,690
have a nice talk with him.

132
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:28,830
You have your ways of holding Madam Kou's funeral.

133
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,810
Do it properly and don't let grief consume you.

134
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,240
The Lingyuan Sect

135
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,010
will depend on you in the future.

136
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:37,150
Yun Xiang.

137
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,100
Come with me.

138
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:54,800
What do you think of what happened today?

139
00:15:57,220 --> 00:15:59,120
A candle is supposed to light the dark,

140
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,390
but the darkest place

141
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,200
is right under the candlestick.

142
00:16:03,890 --> 00:16:04,970
I'm relieved for you

143
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:07,650
that Nangong Fang died.

144
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,630
I wasn't hard on Kou Lianyi.

145
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,240
I don't see the need for you to defend her.

146
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,170
It has nothing to do with her

147
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:18,360
but with something in the past.

148
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,420
What's it?

149
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,730
It's related to me

150
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:24,550
and you.

151
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,560
Around the 20th year of Tianqing,

152
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,870
eight censors together with many other officials

153
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,570
complained to His Majesty

154
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,740
that your reform was too radical.

155
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,100
His Majesty expelled you from the capital because of that.

156
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,340
I guess since then,

157
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,010
you've been biding your time

158
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,600
for this big plan.

159
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,340
Not long after you left,

160
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,220
those eight censors and their families

161
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:49,900
either died in accidents

162
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,220
or got murdered.

163
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:56,980
Really?

164
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,990
If that were true,

165
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,130
the imperial court would have brought me to book.

166
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,420
I studied in the Yuntai Sect for 15 years.

167
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,079
I know you have wisdom and a big heart,

168
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:11,010
so I'm sure you didn't do that.

169
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,510
Then who did it?

170
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,470
And how did you know about it?

171
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:19,000
Liu Gongquan always wants to use the Yuntai Sect

172
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:20,569
to find evidence of your treason.

173
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,410
I agreed to help him on the condition

174
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,640
that he'd help me get to the bottom of this matter.

175
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,690
So Liu Gongquan went to the east coast

176
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,220
to investigate this case.

177
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:33,940
Yes.

178
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,410
Nangong Fang was the mastermind

179
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:39,380
of the east-coast land purchase case in the 26th year of Tianqing.

180
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,470
He took down Mr. Wen

181
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:43,640
and submitted his pledge to the Lingyuan Sect.

182
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,900
Then why did he kill the whole Luo family's village

183
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,420
on the pretext of buying land?

184
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,450
Because one of the eight censors

185
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,610
was about to retire and return to his hometown.

186
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:57,140
His hometown was the Luo family's village.

187
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:58,480
Over the years,

188
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,530
Nangong Fang never mentioned it.

189
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:01,970
There's only one explanation.

190
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,320
Once the time was right,

191
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:08,660
he would blame that atrocity on you.

192
00:18:08,930 --> 00:18:11,540
You wouldn't be able to prove yourself innocent.

193
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:22,780
You are

194
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:26,830
from the Luo family's village?

195
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:29,920
Yes.

196
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,500
Now I know the whole story.

197
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,740
It explains why you didn't listen to me

198
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,890
after you left the mountain

199
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:39,060
and caused quite a stir in Nandu.

200
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,780
So it's all about a blood feud.

201
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:42,840
Yes.

202
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,300
Why didn't you tell me

203
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,700
about Nangong Fang until today?

204
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:48,920
I didn't want to put you in a dilemma.

205
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,470
Aren't you afraid of him telling on you to me?

206
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:53,690
No.

207
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:00,890
You know that in my heart

208
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,090
you're more important than him.

209
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,050
I won't assume that.

210
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,090
You're right.

211
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,610
I need all hands on deck now.

212
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,160
I wanted you to go to Yangzhou with me.

213
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,380
But now it seems

214
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,700
that you should go to Nandu

215
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,220
and make arrangements in advance.

216
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,620
I'll go where you want me to go.

217
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:27,380
Take your Kou Lianyi with you.

218
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:30,140
Get prepared after you arrive in Nandu.

219
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:30,900
Yes.

220
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,740
All right. Go.

221
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,810
Do you really trust Yun Xiang

222
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:44,300
and plan to put him in an important position?

223
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,310
Take your best men

224
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,310
and escort him to Nandu.

225
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:52,860
You want me to protect him and watch over him?

226
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,670
Don't hurt yourself.

227
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:55,700
Yanan.

228
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,740
You still have me.

229
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,940
There are so many things I haven't done for her.

230
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,700
I can't do them for her anymore.

231
00:21:31,670 --> 00:21:33,050
My father passed away when I was young.

232
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:38,550
I always hoped that I could grow up sooner

233
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,620
to share Mother's burden.

234
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,330
Mother was a tough woman

235
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,540
and a disciple of the Lingyuan Sect.

236
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,130
I thought a lot about how she might die,

237
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:56,230
but never in this way.

238
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,610
How could someone's heart be so corrupt?

239
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:19,740
That guy,

240
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,100
how do you want him to pay?

241
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:37,730
Prince Fu.

242
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,520
Did you get the seal?

243
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:40,850
All branches of the Lingyuan Sect

244
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,460
can be deployed with this seal.

245
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,310
Now that we have it,

246
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,170
all branches are yours to command.

247
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:52,810
Your sister has found out what you did to Madam Kou.

248
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,580
There's no Madam Kou anymore.

249
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,340
You're right.

250
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,960
Master Kou,

251
00:23:11,750 --> 00:23:14,700
I'll depart to Yangzhou tomorrow to gather the troops.

252
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,960
You'll wait at the Lingyuan branch.

253
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,120
After I arrange everything,

254
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,900
you'll rise up when I tell you to

255
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:25,500
and catch the border barracks off guard.

256
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,460
Why don't we rise up together?

257
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,690
Winning the first battle at the border

258
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,380
is a great honor.

259
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,980
I never doubt

260
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,260
that you're trustworthy.

261
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,820
But there are people who object

262
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,170
to my joining forces with you.

263
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,780
You need a great deed to shut them up.

264
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,320
Rest assured, Prince Fu.

265
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,030
I won't fail you in this.

266
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,480
Master Kou.

267
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,170
You're very talented.

268
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,010
You'll make great achievements in the future.

269
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,540
After we succeed,

270
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,360
how about you rule the north and I rule the south?

271
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,250
We can discuss this

272
00:24:09,430 --> 00:24:10,550
after I break through the border defenses.

273
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:12,520
Okay.

274
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,250
Father.

275
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,830
Did you stay up all night again?

276
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,770
I told you

277
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,770
that you don't have to worry about those things.

278
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,180
I know.

279
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,900
I'll go to Yangzhou.

280
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,740
You stay here.

281
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,280
I'll ask someone to keep you company.

282
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:00,180
Father.

283
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:02,780
I've packed my things.

284
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:04,220
I'll go with you.

285
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,260
Mingzhu.

286
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:16,020
You know why I'm leaving for Yangzhou.

287
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,060
War is coming.

288
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,170
This is the safest place.

289
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,610
If all my family is gone,

290
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,230
what's the point of staying somewhere safe?

291
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:28,540
Father.

292
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,040
I've made up my mind.

293
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:33,470
Do you remember me going to Nandu all alone?

294
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,810
If you insist on leaving me behind,

295
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,240
I’m afraid I'll go to Yangzhou alone to find you again.

296
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,320
But if you go with me,

297
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,240
I'm afraid...

298
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:44,990
It doesn't matter.

299
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:50,880
Fine.

300
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,540
Let's do as we planned.

301
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:05,720
You must be careful.

302
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,960
Miss Kou, is Yun Xiang here?

303
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:14,650
Yes.

304
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:22,940
Your Highness.

305
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:24,430
Let's talk somewhere else.

306
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:42,410
Actually, I came to say goodbye.

307
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,780
After we part ways today,

308
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,920
I don't know what it'll be like when we meet again.

309
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,340
I didn't expect you to go to Yangzhou too.

310
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,190
I thought Prince Fu

311
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,700
would let you stay here.

312
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,670
I begged Father

313
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,640
to take me with him.

314
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,180
So many things happened recently.

315
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,650
I find it hard to tell right from wrong.

316
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,580
I'm just taking it one day at a time.

317
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,040
At this point,

318
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:12,660
I can only cherish what I have now.

319
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,940
Yes. Take it one day at a time.

320
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,510
That's good.

321
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:19,220
Yun Xiang.

322
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,700
I want to ask you one last time.

323
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,260
Do you have any ways to stop my father

324
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,150
and help him get out of this intact?

325
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,970
Prince Fu's plans have always been foolproof.

326
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:33,600
He'll be fine.

327
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:36,910
Alright.

328
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,980
Take care of yourself and Miss Kou.

329
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,160
You too.

330
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,970
Actually, I always have the feeling

331
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,240
that you've already got a plan.

332
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,460
But after all that's happened,

333
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:54,540
I don't know what I can say

334
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:55,830
or what I can do.

335
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,710
I just hope you can

336
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,070
look out for him

337
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,050
for old times' sake.

338
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,930
It'll be a long journey. Take care.

339
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,380
You once said Yun Xiang is genius

340
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:52,890
but too high-profile

341
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:53,910
and sophisticated

342
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,710
to be on a long leash.

343
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,660
Why did you let him go so easily?

344
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:01,270
Nangong Fang is dead.

345
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,080
Nandu needs to be in the charge of someone capable.

346
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:06,730
Besides,

347
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,830
I had a talk with him last night.

348
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,530
I finally knew

349
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:14,220
why he was always so wayward.

350
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,660
Compared to Nangong Fang,

351
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:23,360
Yun Xiang understands better the core beliefs of the Yuntai Sect.

352
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:45,020
Does he really trust you?

353
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,920
I just wanted to leave here.

354
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,560
I don't care whether he trusts me or not.

355
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,400
Tell me how you want

356
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,950
to hold your mother's funeral.

357
00:29:59,250 --> 00:29:59,800
I'll help you.

358
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,090
She's gone now.

359
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:06,090
I'll just give her one last ride.

360
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:19,880
Mingyu.

361
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,870
Although the Su family is not as prosperous as before,

362
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,100
it still owns

363
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,160
a sizable amount of properties in Nandu.

364
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:33,420
How come you're reduced to selling all of them?

365
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,940
What happened?

366
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:36,580
Mr. Liu,

367
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,510
I'd rather not say,

368
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:41,320
but I do need money for something urgent.

369
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,790
I'd be grateful if you could help me out.

370
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,160
Every business of the Su family is making profits.

371
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,460
I think you'll be able to make money

372
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:55,910
the very day you take over them.

373
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,120
There's nothing to lose.

374
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,990
Mr. Su, you're so efficient.

375
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,770
I heard that all the supplies we need

376
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,210
have been purchased.

377
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:06,660
You gave me an order.

378
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,180
Of course I'd do my best to carry it out.

379
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,520
But I heard

380
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,160
that you're selling your family assets.

381
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,710
Please have a look, Mr. Xu.

382
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:25,570
You can see that the value of the military supplies I bought

383
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,410
is way more than

384
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,810
the 400,000 taels you approved.

385
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,410
When it comes to wars,

386
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,770
abundant supplies are the most important.

387
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,260
I've made up my mind

388
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:36,040
to take my chances.

389
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,320
I don't care if I'll be broken.

390
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,570
Even if I have to risk my life,

391
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,410
I'll give Prince Fu my full support.

392
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:45,700
I'm impressed by your insight and courage.

393
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,560
You flatter me, Mr. Xu.

394
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,740
I just hope you can put in a good word

395
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:53,610
for me with Prince Fu.

396
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:54,890
To be honest,

397
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,350
I'm really not good at business.

398
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,690
It'd be great

399
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:01,750
if Prince Fu could give me an appointment.

400
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,230
No problem.

401
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:08,890
I'll see myself out.

402
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:10,160
Take care, Mr. Xu.

403
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:19,290
[Jishan Hall]

404
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:23,500
These should be enough to fund the foundling home for a while.

405
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,450
Not just for a while.

406
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,980
They're enough to support the children for years.

407
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,460
Miss Ke, what happened?

408
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,720
Stay away from Liansheng House for a while.

409
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,300
Did something happen?

410
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,270
Nothing serious.

411
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:43,980
We can handle it.

412
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:46,410
Just take good care of the children.

413
00:32:50,070 --> 00:32:51,550
If riots break out,

414
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:53,580
close the gate

415
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:54,950
and wait for them to blow over.

416
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:56,460
Also,

417
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,300
no matter what happens in the future,

418
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,590
make sure the foundling home stand.

419
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:05,810
I will.

420
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,540
I promised Jin to do that.

421
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,290
Take me to see the children.

422
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:20,840
Water and fire don't have lives.

423
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:24,670
Water and fire don't have lives.

424
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:26,620
Plants have lives but don't have emotions.

425
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:29,660
Plants have lives but don't have emotions.

426
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,400
Animals have emotions but don't have minds.

427
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:35,500
Animals have emotions but don't have minds.

428
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:38,220
Humans have lives, emotions,

429
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,660
and minds.

430
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,250
Humans have lives, emotions,

431
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:44,890
and minds.

432
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,350
After Jin died,

433
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,300
they seem to have grown up overnight.

434
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,420
They've all been very sweet.

435
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,700
If Jin were still alive,

436
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,180
he'd be so relieved

437
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,960
to see this.

438
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,300
Tianhu.

439
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,090
Take care of yourself

440
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:16,130
and take care of the kids.

441
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,620
Remember what I said.

442
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,150
I have to go.

443
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,380
The jade in the mountain nourishes all the plants.

444
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:26,940
The pearl in the river keeps the flowers on the band from withering.

445
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,580
The jade in the mountain nourishes all the plants.

446
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,639
The pearl in the river keeps the flowers on the band from withering.

447
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,770
If one keeps doing good things.

448
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:38,270
You wouldn't tell me what happened,

449
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,080
so I won't pry into it.

450
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,500
But no matter what, stay alive.

451
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:48,380
I'll be waiting for you.

452
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:50,770
Okay.

453
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,400
The pearl in the river keeps the flowers on the band from withering.

454
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:56,929
I'll go.

455
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,820
The pearl in the river keeps the flowers on the band from withering.

456
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,100
If one keeps doing good things.

457
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,340
If one keeps doing good things.

458
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,980
How's it possible that they'll stay obscure forever?

459
00:35:06,090 --> 00:35:08,410
How's it possible that they'll stay obscure forever?

460
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:12,830
Master Kou.

461
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,150
Master Kou.

462
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:18,440
It's time to set off.

463
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:19,860
Master Kou.

464
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:22,660
It's time to set off.

465
00:35:25,270 --> 00:35:27,170
It's just visiting the Lingyuan branch.

466
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,110
There's no need to rush.

467
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:32,870
Master Kou.

468
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,610
I found this when I cleaned Kou Lianyi's room.

469
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,760
No one can tell what's in it.

470
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,740
Of course you can't tell what it is.

471
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,620
This is Hidden Cold Scale.

472
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,140
After ingestion, the skin turns livid

473
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,450
and breathing ceases.

474
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,880
The victim becomes like a hibernating snake.

475
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,680
They won't wake up until three days later.

476
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:02,410
Come with me to the back mountain now.

477
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,530
Bring some men with you.

478
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,220
Yes.

479
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:11,500
Careful.

480
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:12,340
Careful.

481
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:16,010
Okay.

482
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:16,790
Put it down.

483
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,380
Where is Mr. Nangong?

484
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,010
They haven't gone far.

485
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:41,560
Go after them!

486
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,220
Mr. Yun.

487
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:00,750
Why did we stop?

488
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,990
His Highness ordered us to go to Nandu without delay.

489
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,550
Report it to Prince Fu now!

490
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,930
Are you sure you can handle him?

491
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,340
He and his men will catch up soon.

492
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,520
It's okay.

493
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:32,800
I just hope he comes sooner.

494
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,750
Master Kou, why are you here?

495
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,780
I found this in your room.

496
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,890
I dug Nangong Fang's grave.

497
00:39:21,380 --> 00:39:22,220
His coffin is empty.

498
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,120
You're already the Sect Master.

499
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:26,280
Why can't you leave her alone

500
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:28,400
and spare her that false accusation?

501
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:29,780
False accusation?

502
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:33,340
We'll know if it's false after we open the coffin.

503
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:34,310
Stop!

504
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:40,710
Think twice.

505
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:43,210
It's your mother who's lying inside.

506
00:39:46,030 --> 00:39:47,200
Don't be fooled by him.

507
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,190
Nangong Fang knows lots of Prince Fu's plans.

508
00:39:50,630 --> 00:39:53,290
He needs to be either dead or with us.

509
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,250
Go get her!

510
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:54,350
Watch out!

511
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,450
Go catch Yun Xiang!

512
00:41:06,830 --> 00:41:07,310
Yes.

513
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:19,000
Leave it to me. You go first.

514
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,930
I move fast and this dagger is poisoned.

515
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:33,680
I may be able to kill some of them.

516
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,900
If we have to die, we die together.

517
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,590
Then I'll grant your wish.

518
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,200
Kill!

519
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:14,310
Bring it on.

520
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:15,580
Bring it on!

521
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:21,510
Don't you want to die together?

522
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,260
I'll chop off his hands and feet first.

523
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,880
He'll wish he were dead!

524
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,530
Don't kill me, Lianyi.

525
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:46,120
They gave me no choice.

526
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,370
I was forced to do all this.

527
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,220
The seal.

528
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:51,610
The seal.

529
00:43:52,070 --> 00:43:52,500
Lianyi.

530
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:53,820
Here is the Sect Master's seal.

531
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,730
I'll give the position of the Sect Master to you.

532
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,260
I'm selfish and greedy.

533
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,280
I deserve to die.

534
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:00,010
But Lianyi,

535
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,830
I'm your brother.

536
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:04,610
And Mother.

537
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:05,900
If Mother were here…

538
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,070
How dare you mention her?

539
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:09,030
The thing I hate most

540
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:11,680
about living in this world

541
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:15,500
is having a despicable brother like you.

542
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:13,100
Thank you for your help, Lord Liu.

543
00:45:14,390 --> 00:45:15,500
Any time.

544
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:20,780
Have you seen Yun Xiang?

545
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,880
The imperial edict has been drafted.

546
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:38,200
As long as the Lingyuan Sect stays out of this,

547
00:46:38,810 --> 00:46:39,800
when the dust settles,

548
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:41,940
the court will make things right

549
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:43,360
and no longer treat its disciples as rebels.

550
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,260
Thank you, Lord Liu.

551
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,000
Save it.

552
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,480
I just fulfilled my promise to you.

553
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:59,020
Time is pressing.

554
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,580
She has to go now to stop the Lingyuan Sect's branches from joining the uprising.

555
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:04,080
So she can't go with us

556
00:47:04,110 --> 00:47:06,040
to meet Her Majesty.

557
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:06,940
Okay.

558
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:08,980
If you need assistance,

559
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:10,410
I can provide you men.

560
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:12,780
I can do it on my own.

561
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,380
Then I'll leave it to you, Miss Kou.

562
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,090
Please keep the Lingyuan Sect's branches in check.

563
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,580
Otherwise, when the war begins,

564
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:20,660
numerous people will die.

565
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:23,290
Neither Yingyuan, Yuntai, nor the court

566
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:25,530
can be the so-called winner.

567
00:47:55,550 --> 00:47:57,090
The fire in Yufeng Warehouse back then

568
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,690
drew the Su family into perpetual conflict.

569
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:04,010
Hope this fire can put an end to everything.

570
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:08,500
Let's go.

571
00:48:18,750 --> 00:48:19,310
Mr. Xu.

572
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:20,490
There's another fire in the city.

573
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:21,290
Where?

574
00:48:21,620 --> 00:48:22,500
The Su family's warehouse.

575
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:58,850
That's it?

576
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,950
People in the Lingyuan Sect never take death too seriously.

577
00:49:04,170 --> 00:49:05,490
We don't believe in the afterlife either.

578
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:10,580
Our secret soldiers are always ready to die.

579
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:12,350
Mother was the same.

580
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,300
This is a beautiful place.

581
00:49:19,820 --> 00:49:22,460
If her ghost were still around, she'd find peace of mind here.

582
00:49:24,770 --> 00:49:25,970
There's no coming back from the dead.

583
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,500
She's part of the mountain now.

584
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,460
Mother lived an eventful life,

585
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:36,090
but she's six feet under now like we all will be.

586
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:46,620
Yun Xiang.

587
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,600
Do you know what it means

588
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:52,450
to continue on this path?

589
00:49:55,730 --> 00:49:56,700
Of course.

590
00:49:59,650 --> 00:50:00,460
But I'm tired.

591
00:50:02,980 --> 00:50:04,330
When it dawns,

592
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:05,860
I'll have to face

593
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,280
unceasing tumult

594
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:10,980
and conflict again.

595
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:12,810
Plot against others and be plotted against.

596
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:16,480
I'm so fed up with all that.

597
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:22,330
I'll personally order all the branches to dismiss the secret soldiers,

598
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:27,550
but this is the last time I help you.

599
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:34,250
Are you leaving?

600
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,330
You've allied with the court.

601
00:50:41,090 --> 00:50:44,240
After the rebellion is quelled, you'll surely be recruited by the court.

602
00:50:46,220 --> 00:50:47,410
You should avoid getting involved with us bandits.

603
00:50:50,230 --> 00:50:51,960
So I guess we have to say goodbye.

604
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:55,360
♫It's dark but friends are not back♫

605
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,530
♫The night breeze can't understand sadness and heartache♫

606
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:04,850
♫Rain falls all night long and I stay awake♫

607
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:10,330
♫The night rain can't conceal the sorrow♫

608
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:14,830
♫Memory is a book♫

609
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:20,000
♫Who wrote all those stories♫

610
00:51:19,420 --> 00:51:20,190
Take this.

611
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:24,600
♫Without realizing it♫

612
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:29,870
♫So many years have passed♫

613
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,160
What's this?

614
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,980
♫Flowers fall into the garden♫

615
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:33,580
Just trust me.

616
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:38,780
♫Dear friends, why haven't we met earlier♫

617
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:47,790
♫Destiny is so cruel♫

618
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:51,700
♫The cloud disperses and mountains are seen♫

619
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,920
♫How many old friends are gone♫

620
00:51:54,130 --> 00:51:56,460
♫I raise my cup to beckon the bright moon♫

621
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:58,780
♫People I miss are thousands of miles away♫

622
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:03,510
♫We let go of the past♫

623
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:08,020
♫Stories take place thousands of miles away♫

624
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:10,950
♫The cloud disperses and mountains are seen♫

625
00:52:10,990 --> 00:52:13,230
♫How many old friends are gone♫

626
00:52:13,350 --> 00:52:15,710
♫I raise my cup to beckon the bright moon♫

627
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:18,070
♫People I miss are thousands of miles away♫

628
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:22,710
♫We let go of the past♫

629
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:27,570
♫Stories take place thousands of miles away♫

630
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:37,980
♫Stories take place thousands of miles away♫
