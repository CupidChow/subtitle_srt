[Episode 34: A Critical Moment]

4
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:17,500
It was you who brought Kang Qiao into the sect.

5
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,940
And you've worked together for many years.

6
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:24,220
I know how close you two were.

7
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,220
But the dead can't come back to life.

8
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,650
Don't let grief get the better of you.

9
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,620
With his reckless nature,

10
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:38,540
this was going to happen sooner or later.

11
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,910
Kang Qiao is not exactly qualified,

12
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,020
but he may be buried in Beishan Cemetery.

13
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,320
It's OK, Master.

14
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,770
The dead are dead.

15
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,270
Funerals are just for the living.

16
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,450
I don't care about those things.

17
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,970
Let's keep it simple.

18
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,540
Mo Bufan,

19
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,800
if you have a grievance,

20
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,650
why can't you be frank about it?

21
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,000
I have no grievance.

22
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,760
Kang Qiao had it coming to him.

23
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,250
You don't need to console me.

24
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:23,570
Your Highness.

25
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,080
It's just the death of a nobody.

26
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,840
Why bother consoling him personally?

27
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,380
What was the order that I gave you?

28
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:34,320
To get rid of Zhong Beidou

29
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:35,820
as a warning to others.

30
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,560
But why did you draw so much attention to it?

31
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,030
You see, Your Highness,

32
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,280
if it's meant as a warning to others,

33
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,340
why shouldn't we draw attention to it?

34
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,820
Besides, I also deliberately

35
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,570
lured Kou Yuanjie in.

36
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,980
The Kou family will make a decision soon.

37
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,220
Nangong Fang,

38
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,510
you and Yun Xiang are equally talented.

39
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:00,550
But you're too confident.

40
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,190
You'll get yourself into trouble if you go on like this.

41
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,640
You're here to talk me out of it too?

42
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,190
Do you really have to do this?

43
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,710
It's indeed very cowardly

44
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:18,740
to die in such a way.

45
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:25,750
But I can see no way out.

46
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:33,310
Or maybe you could help me find one?

47
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:47,940
It's my determination to right past wrongs

48
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,640
that's got me through these years.

49
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,190
I'm not like you.

50
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,350
You can live on your determination.

51
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:01,880
But the hatred inside me has burned all my internal organs.

52
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,510
I'd rather die.

53
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,580
If we work together, we can save people from disasters.

54
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,900
Isn't that a reason for living on?

55
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,800
That day in the mountains,

56
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:26,620
you told me you knew who Master was

57
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,670
and wanted me to join you in foiling his plot.

58
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,360
I agreed then

59
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,570
for the sake of Yuntai.

60
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:43,280
But now I am utterly disappointed in Yuntai

61
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,610
and have no desire to fight.

62
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,580
Fine. You don't have to do anything.

63
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,409
We don't need to work together.

64
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,070
Just live on.

65
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:57,170
OK?

66
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:59,570
Do you really think Master trusts you?

67
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,790
You think he knows nothing about

68
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,010
your dealings with Liu Gongquan?

69
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,900
If he has the slightest suspicion about you,

70
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,050
you can't expect him

71
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:11,530
to spare your life at a critical moment.

72
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,310
You think I don't know that?

73
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:17,660
It's precisely because I know there's no turning back

74
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,710
that I keep on going forward.

75
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,059
Drink it up,

76
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:40,700
and let our friendship in Nandu

77
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,750
end here.

78
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,280
Out of all the fellow disciples at Yuntai,

79
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,730
you are the only one that I can trust now.

80
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:17,100
I won't let you die.

81
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:19,470
You must live.

82
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,070
For you,

83
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,070
I'll live for a few more days.

84
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:37,670
You're such a fool.

85
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,580
Why did you meddle in Yuntai's affairs?

86
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,810
I rendered a great service.

87
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:43,450
Why are you scolding me again?

88
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,230
Nangong Fang knew you were eager to render a great service,

89
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,440
so he used you as a weapon

90
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,280
to warn others.

91
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,450
Zhong Beidou absconded.

92
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,180
Prince Fu wasn't going to keep him anyway.

93
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,600
Since we were going to join forces,

94
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:55,590
I did that to show our sincerity to Prince Fu.

95
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,520
What's wrong with that?

96
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,980
Who said I'd decided to join forces with them?

97
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,800
Do we have any other option?

98
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,640
Lingyuan has become the way it is now

99
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:04,430
all because of your indecisiveness!

100
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,280
Shut up!

101
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,480
Don't let me see you again.

102
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,450
It's my fault he's the way he is now,

103
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,010
and I'm paying the penalty.

104
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:20,370
Mother,

105
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,510
Prince Fu will probably call us to account

106
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:24,630
and force you to agree to join forces.

107
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,500
Actually,

108
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,030
joining forces isn't our only option.

109
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,280
I know what you mean.

110
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,900
But how can you be sure

111
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,330
that Yun Xiang isn't here to spy on us

112
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:43,170
on Prince Fu's order?

113
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,270
Mother,

114
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:45,670
I know our situation

115
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,070
and am not being swayed by emotions.

116
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,410
I trust him

117
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,370
because I have considered the pros and cons

118
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,610
as a member of Lingyuan and the Kou family.

119
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,290
Father,

120
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,380
I heard that those elders of the sect

121
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,500
will be executed soon.

122
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,440
Didn't you say

123
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,460
you would handle this without bloodshed?

124
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,620
Mingzhu,

125
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:22,020
great undertakings entail sacrifices.

126
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:22,630
We kill

127
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,450
so that we won't have to kill in the future.

128
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,080
So how many more people will die

129
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:28,230
for the sake of your great undertaking?

130
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,150
If this is how you do it,

131
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,660
how are you different from those in the imperial government

132
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,340
who purge dissidents for their selfish desires?

133
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:35,130
How dare you!

134
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,160
Mingzhu,

135
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,210
I have explained to you

136
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:44,050
what is at stake in all this.

137
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:46,220
If I don't kill them now,

138
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:48,520
won't we be giving them the opportunity to kill us?

139
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:50,790
I'm afraid

140
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,080
you're only going to see more killings

141
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,530
in the days to come.

142
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,880
Are we going to kill everyone

143
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:02,280
who disagrees with us?

144
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,560
Mingzhu,

145
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,330
we are all flesh and blood.

146
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,370
The more lives you take,

147
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,270
the deeper you are in karmic debt.

148
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:21,700
I'm only doing it because I have no choice.

149
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,180
Do you think

150
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,370
I am really a heartless person?

151
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,040
Take Yun Xiang, for example.

152
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:34,840
I know he has objections,

153
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,510
but I'm not entirely willing

154
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,630
to get rid of him.

155
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:43,420
But Yun Xiang said that

156
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,880
he would do his best to help.

157
00:12:48,620 --> 00:12:49,300
Mingzhu,

158
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,270
don't ever believe what people say.

159
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,410
He's claiming to be on my side

160
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,340
in order to protect himself.

161
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,160
You know that.

162
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,320
He's close with Gongquan.

163
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,300
How can I be sure

164
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,700
that they're not hatching a conspiracy?

165
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:08,790
Yun Xiang's life

166
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,020
is as much in his hands as it's in mine.

167
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,220
I'm sending him to Nandu this time

168
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,840
to let him make his own choice.

169
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,270
Your Highness, you wanted to see me?

170
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:28,530
Yun Xiang,

171
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,700
if my father sends you to Nandu,

172
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,940
you must not refuse.

173
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,510
Why is His Highness sending me to Nandu?

174
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:38,470
I can't really give you any details.

175
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,800
Anyway, remember what I said.

176
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,870
It can save your life.

177
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,180
If His Highness doesn't trust me,

178
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,360
he can kill me.

179
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,790
As a member of Yuntai,

180
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,470
I have no place in this world.

181
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,000
Please tell His Highness

182
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:55,960
that I'm absolutely loyal to him.

183
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,710
My father asked me to test you.

184
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,130
Those who achieve great things in the world

185
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,350
must sever their personal relationships

186
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,980
and only keep the most trustworthy people by their side.

187
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,290
That's normal.

188
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:11,010
Those who aspire to achieve great things...

189
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:12,700
Including you?

190
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:14,840
Including me.

191
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,050
I don't believe it.

192
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,990
They all said

193
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,130
you're unpredictable

194
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,660
and evil.

195
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,450
But as soon as I met you,

196
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,470
I knew they were wrong about you.

197
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,360
You're too kind, Your Highness.

198
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,090
I was taught by Master himself.

199
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:59,640
You mean the royal supplier selection

200
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:01,850
is rigged?

201
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,720
I'm now in charge of the affairs of Nandu Government Office.

202
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,610
Why would I lie to you?

203
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,200
But Advisor Xu...

204
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,000
Lord Xu.

205
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,130
I remember in the past the selection results

206
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,860
were presented to His Majesty first,

207
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,780
so that His Majesty could confer the title himself.

208
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:19,740
Of course,

209
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,510
I mean no disrespect.

210
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,380
But how is Nandu Government Office

211
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,420
able to rig the result?

212
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,580
Well... Here's how it works.

213
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,160
Mr. Su, are you close with Yun Xiang?

214
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,700
If someone tries to make things difficult for you,

215
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,310
be sure to tell him

216
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,170
what I've just said.

217
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:52,150
Yun Xiang is a business partner of ours.

218
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,410
That's all?

219
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,760
To be exact,

220
00:15:57,770 --> 00:16:00,600
Yun Xiang is our enemy and friend.

221
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,960
He tends to use both tempting promises

222
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,160
and threats

223
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,440
to make me throw in my lot with him.

224
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:08,840
Of course,

225
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:10,870
although he's always taking advantage of us,

226
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,520
we do manage to make a modest profit from it.

227
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:18,860
I see.

228
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,810
As befits a family of merchants,

229
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,540
you know how to make the most of any situation.

230
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,100
Lord Xu,

231
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,290
maybe you could just tell Mr. Su?

232
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,020
Appointing your family as the royal silk supplier

233
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:35,280
is a generous gift from Prince Fu.

234
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,020
But while it's a gift,

235
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,000
you are expected to reciprocate.

236
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:46,560
Right.

237
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,140
Right.

238
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,290
Be sure to do the thing

239
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,350
that I've just asked you to as soon as possible.

240
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:56,280
Remember,

241
00:16:56,810 --> 00:16:57,670
keep it a secret.

242
00:16:58,460 --> 00:16:59,260
People are orderly

243
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,660
as long as merchants are.

244
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,420
Your family is the leader of Nandu Chamber of Commerce.

245
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:05,869
From now on, no matter what you hear

246
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,869
or see,

247
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,599
you should always speak or act

248
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:11,930
with caution.

249
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:13,510
I will.

250
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,160
Who are you?

251
00:17:31,730 --> 00:17:33,030
How dare you trespass on my property!

252
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,220
Mr. Su, how have you been?

253
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,520
What did Xu Qingwen tell you?

254
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,260
I'm just a merchant

255
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,710
running a normal business.

256
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,470
Why am I getting visits

257
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,840
from Nandu Government Office and Imperial Security Office

258
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,230
within one day?

259
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,200
Just answer the question.

260
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,620
Yun Xiang told me a lot about you.

261
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,000
Did he tell you to distance yourself from him

262
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,430
before he left Nandu?

263
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,290
Do you know Shao Yiheng is dead?

264
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,800
So that's why it was Advisor Xu who came.

265
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,730
How did Magistrate Shao die?

266
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,640
The announcement says it's a sudden death caused by

267
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:25,930
excessive drinking.

268
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:27,820
It's probably not true.

269
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,460
Prince Fu ordered to kill him.

270
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,170
Not only Shao Yiheng,

271
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:33,450
but all the officials in Nandu

272
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,380
have been replaced by Prince Fu's men.

273
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:36,770
You're right.

274
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,330
It's indeed Prince Fu's rebellion.

275
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,350
But I've joined forces with Yun Xiang

276
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,330
in the hope of ending this turmoil.

277
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:47,000
Otherwise, there'll be endless misery inflicted by war.

278
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,030
Where is Yun now?

279
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:50,680
He's with Prince Fu,

280
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,250
trying to find out his plans for the rebellion

281
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,950
and biding his time before we can work more closely together.

282
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,600
In that case, isn't Yun...

283
00:18:59,090 --> 00:19:00,080
In great danger.

284
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:03,710
My lord,

285
00:19:04,430 --> 00:19:05,790
we can't stay in the city for long.

286
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,390
Mr. Su,

287
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,050
as this is urgent, I'll be frank.

288
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:13,010
If you accept Xu Qingwen's offer and participate in the rebellion,

289
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,990
you'll most certainly die. So now...

290
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,290
I'm giving you a chance to survive.

291
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,850
I'm the young master of Lingyuan.

292
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,370
How can you order me around?

293
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,210
Are you really not going?

294
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,630
I didn't kill Zhong Beidou alone.

295
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:45,850
Young Master Kou,

296
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,530
we're just passing the message.

297
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,060
Why make things difficult for us?

298
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:52,700
You saw it.

299
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,230
Although I wounded Zhong Beidou,

300
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,350
it wan't fatal.

301
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,760
Besides,

302
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,090
Xu Lang joined in as well.

303
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,760
His Highness checked it himself.

304
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,380
The stab you delivered was the fatal one.

305
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,800
Yuntai's martial arts master died for nothing.

306
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,040
If we ignore this,

307
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,740
I'm afraid it'll disappoint our sect members.

308
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,920
Yun, what do you think?

309
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:20,880
I'll abide by Master's decision.

310
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
Lingyuan has been slow

311
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,490
to decide on joining forces.

312
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:28,340
What does Madam Kou intend to do?

313
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:28,840
I...

314
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:31,740
I tried to persuade her many times.

315
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,320
Young Master Kou,

316
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:35,380
what else can we do to help you

317
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,680
besides waiting?

318
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,470
In that case,

319
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,740
we'll do everything we can

320
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,110
and use more bargaining chips.

321
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,790
You only need Madam Kou's seal

322
00:20:53,790 --> 00:20:55,120
to have the branches at your disposal.

323
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,560
I'll just steal it.

324
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,370
W-Why are you laughing?

325
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,140
Your Highness,

326
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,090
I'm truly willing to join forces.

327
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,240
I'm not the one who's trying to stall it.

328
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,060
Why take it out on me?

329
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,530
It's easy for you to steal the seal.

330
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,140
But won't Yuntai be accused of instigating you?

331
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:20,680
Even that won't work?

332
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,690
Are you expecting me to usurp the position of Sect Master?

333
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:23,930
Young Sect Master Kou...

334
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,740
is indeed decisive.

335
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:29,460
I...

336
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,780
Let me see who's there!

337
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,240
Go away!

338
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,940
Kang Qiao and Mr. Zhong have just died,

339
00:21:47,530 --> 00:21:49,940
and you're having a good time here?

340
00:21:49,940 --> 00:21:50,940
Mr. Mo, you are drunk.

341
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:51,560
Go away!

342
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,730
You've really grasped the essence of Yuntai.

343
00:21:57,490 --> 00:21:58,570
No love or hatred.

344
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,790
What a walking corpse!

345
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,500
Mo Bufan,

346
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,810
why are you doing this anyway?

347
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,850
Who do you think you are?

348
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,470
This is Yuntai's headquarters!

349
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:14,240
What right do you have to sit here?

350
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,810
Master ordered you to take charge of Yuezhou.

351
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,870
You turned your nose up at that barren place

352
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,870
and insisted on coming to Nandu.

353
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,130
And what a mess you've made of Nandu.

354
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,660
If I had known it would come to this,

355
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,950
I would have reported it truthfully!

356
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,220
Mo Bufan,

357
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:44,200
you're drunk.

358
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:49,680
Right.

359
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,070
You're right.

360
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,560
What difference would it have made?

361
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,800
Because you lot

362
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,450
were already colluding

363
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,540
in playing this shady big game.

364
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:06,080
But you kept the two of us in the dark!

365
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,850
-Mr. Mo, let me take you back to rest. -Get lost!

366
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,910
Stay away from me.

367
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,510
Don't dirty me.

368
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,350
What sacred place is this?

369
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,520
You are all crooks!

370
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,050
Prince Fu,

371
00:23:26,010 --> 00:23:27,930
you seriously want to usurp the throne?

372
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:33,230
It's such a shame that despite all your schemes,

373
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,700
you fail to see the fact

374
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:36,690
that these people around you

375
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:39,450
all have their own intentions.

376
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,570
Him?

377
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,230
How can he be willing to play second fiddle?

378
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:46,780
Him?

379
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,270
You think he's a good one?

380
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,260
Do you know how close he is

381
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,180
with the imperial guards?

382
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:55,240
He can take your life in a flash.

383
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,250
Let go of me!

384
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,690
You're seemingly in agreement, but actually at odds.

385
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,620
And you want to do big things?

386
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,400
Young Master Kou.

387
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,000
Stop making me wait.

388
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,930
[To perch on bamboo]

389
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,820
Joining forces concerns the lives

390
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:40,660
of tens of thousands of members of Lingyuan.

391
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,420
I have to be very cautious.

392
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,900
I'll trust you this time.

393
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:50,980
Mother, you've finally...

394
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,900
Why are you giving the seal to her?

395
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,200
What has she done for the sect in all these years?

396
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:03,710
She's done better than you

397
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,370
to have not made things worse.

398
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,330
Have you really made up your mind?

399
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:10,600
How many chances have I given you?

400
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:13,280
You're just not cut out for it.

401
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:15,640
Get out.

402
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,160
I have things to discuss with your sister.

403
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,430
Get out!

404
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,900
Yuanjie is becoming increasingly irritable.

405
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:34,330
It might be better not to provoke him.

406
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,620
I deserve it.

407
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:40,990
Lianyi,

408
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,690
go to Yun Xiang

409
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,630
and tell him what we have just discussed.

410
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:47,710
OK.

411
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,440
How is Mo Bufan?

412
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,040
Mr. Mo?

413
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,270
Get lost!

414
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,710
Get lost!

415
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,500
Mr. Mo, it's Yun Xiang.

416
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:18,180
I'll kill you if you come in!

417
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:05,590
My mother has agreed to dispatch Lingyuan's branches

418
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,680
according to your plan.

419
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:09,420
I think we're halfway there.

420
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:12,830
I heard that the Yuntai members who were trying to escape

421
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,150
are now locked up in the dungeon.

422
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,790
Will Prince Fu let Mr. Mo off?

423
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:19,680
It's impossible.

424
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:24,930
Mr. Mo is now hell-bent on killing himself.

425
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,010
But I'm going to save him, come what may.

426
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,550
I have an idea.

427
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,020
Very good.

428
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,460
This way

429
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,690
I'll be able to get Mr. Mo out of the headquarters

430
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,430
under the pretext of taking him back to his hometown.

431
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,050
It will also help me solve a big problem.

432
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:48,980
What problem?

433
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,170
I've actually always wondered

434
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,210
how they deployed the pirates.

435
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,530
As things stand,

436
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,840
I'll have to use Nangong Fang,

437
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,850
for only he can get in touch with Master Guan.

438
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:04,460
You want to do the same with Nangong Fang

439
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,590
and get him out as well?

440
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,080
That's right.

441
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:10,990
But to use Nangong Fang,

442
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,760
I'll need your help.

443
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:26,880
As usual,

444
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,900
just trust me.

445
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,990
Why does this feel so familiar?

446
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:38,940
From start to finish, you give the orders,

447
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,130
and I carry them out.

448
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,820
I miss this feeling so much.

449
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,380
Does this feel familiar?

450
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:01,480
Get lost!

451
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,180
Don't be rude.

452
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,300
Let him through.

453
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:13,870
Judging from the look on your face,

454
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:17,010
you didn't reach an agreement with Madam Kou, did you?

455
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:22,030
Why don't you sit down and go into detail?

456
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:27,360
Is Prince Fu going to keep his word?

457
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,660
Which word are you talking about?

458
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:47,130
I'll command Lingyuan.

459
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:48,800
Congratulations, Master Kou.

460
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,480
You've finally made up your mind.

461
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:20,280
Advisor Xu must have come on Prince Fu's order,

462
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:26,820
asking you to stock up on army provisions, cloth and minerals.

463
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,870
But what did Lord Liu ask you to do?

464
00:30:31,990 --> 00:30:35,130
He asked me to pretend to help Xu Qingwen

465
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,410
and stock up on military supplies,

466
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,190
but then destroy them all

467
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,260
and leave Prince Fu with an empty city.

468
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:46,170
We have no choice.

469
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,610
My family has been a royal supplier for over a century

470
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:50,540
by the grace of His Majesty.

471
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,910
We won't help Prince Fu stage a revolt.

472
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,540
Nor will I sit by and watch this place

473
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:00,620
become a living hell.

474
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:01,920
Why...

475
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:05,520
Why does all this feel so unreal?

476
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:06,930
Indeed.

477
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,410
Lord Liu also said

478
00:31:11,390 --> 00:31:12,310
that Yun told him

479
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,140
not to get my family involved

480
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,270
for any reason.

481
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,410
But how can I stay out of it,

482
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:19,880
holding a candle to the devil

483
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,770
and watching the people of Nandu suffer from war?

484
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,500
If we follow Lord Liu's plan,

485
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:30,870
what are our chances of saving Mr. Yun?

486
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:35,640
We lost everything and were able to start all over again.

487
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,790
But now we're going against Prince Fu.

488
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:42,400
I'm afraid we'll end up losing our lives.

489
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,300
Xu Qingwen told you

490
00:31:49,930 --> 00:31:53,050
that Dafeng Bank's 400,000 taels of silver is at your disposal?

491
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,690
If we're to cut off Prince Fu's retreat,

492
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:01,110
we'll have to buy all the goods in Nandu?

493
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:02,380
That's right.

494
00:32:04,330 --> 00:32:08,330
We'll have to leave absolutely nothing

495
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:10,930
so as to defeat him completely.

496
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:13,090
Four hundred thousand taels won't be enough.

497
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:16,580
Maybe you'll even lose your...

498
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,350
We have never betted like this before.

499
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,450
Since it's a bet,

500
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,540
the result is uncertain.

501
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,870
Follow your heart.

502
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,110
I'm so lucky

503
00:32:48,990 --> 00:32:49,620
to have you.

504
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,100
What are you

505
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,290
going to do with this wine?

506
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,140
It's poisoned.

507
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,230
There are 4 people in the dungeon,

508
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:26,100
but there are 5 cups.

509
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,920
What you've said to me since your return,

510
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,900
to what extent is it true, or false?

511
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:38,010
It's as true as it's false.

512
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:42,820
To what extent was what Mo Bufan said true, or false?

513
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:45,710
I think

514
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,340
you know it better than me, Master.

515
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,030
It's a good thing

516
00:33:56,930 --> 00:33:59,430
you didn't give Liu Gongquan the location of our headquarters.

517
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,150
Otherwise he would have been ambushed and killed.

518
00:34:04,830 --> 00:34:07,200
Yuntai gave me a second chance at life.

519
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:09,989
I will never betray the sect.

520
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,340
I'm going to Yangzhou tomorrow to reorganize the troops.

521
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,460
Are you going with me?

522
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,610
Yangzhou and Nandu are both important cities.

523
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,880
I wonder what we're going do about Nandu.

524
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,230
I'm leaving the headquarters soon.

525
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,750
I shall not leave any chance

526
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:37,949
for those who've betrayed me to exploit.

527
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:42,300
Come in.

528
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,790
You must have guessed

529
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,450
who this is for.

530
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,020
You two are close.

531
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,350
Bid him farewell.

532
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,500
[Prince Fu]

533
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:19,430
There you are.

534
00:36:25,660 --> 00:36:27,610
This is "Flower of Death."

535
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:29,600
Flower of Death?

536
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,610
One will look pale and bleed after drinking it.

537
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,660
This here will make you look dead,

538
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,160
and it will last for 3 days.

539
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,950
I'll find a way to get you out then.

540
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:51,600
Will I look as if I've taken Flower of Death?

541
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,040
Just drink it.

542
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,280
I'll take care of the rest.

543
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,640
You always think you're smarter than anyone else.

544
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:03,990
Yun Xiang,

545
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,590
it's cold in here.

546
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,580
Warm it for me.

547
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,770
Would you like a green plum in it?

548
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:10,410
Sure.

549
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,570
Not a bad mood for someone whose life is at stake.

550
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,220
Mr. Mo!

551
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:38,840
Why do you have to do this?

552
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:42,540
You fool.

553
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,330
Master is testing you.

554
00:37:47,830 --> 00:37:49,350
If you make any mistake,

555
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:51,830
you'll die.

556
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,850
I'll keep Kang Qiao company.

557
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,030
I've finally tricked you once.

558
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,960
Why do you have to do this?

559
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,740
It's the last thing I can do for you.

560
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:21,820
Hang in there.

561
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:23,890
You're not like them.

562
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,760
You, Luo Wenjia, will follow the way of Yuntai.

563
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:33,670
I'm off.

564
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:36,530
Don't cry.

565
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:13,350
Your Highness,

566
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,270
Mo Bufan is dead.

567
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,150
Looks like

568
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,740
Yun Xiang is someone we can trust.

569
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:42,490
What can I do for you?

570
00:40:43,370 --> 00:40:45,820
I have something important to discuss with you.

571
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:48,580
And you must come alone.

572
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:50,110
Please.

573
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,110
You brought me here

574
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,000
to talk about joining forces, right?

575
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:45,190
Lingyuan and Yuntai have the same root,

576
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:46,710
but we've also been apart for over a century.

577
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:48,210
If we can help

578
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:50,290
bring the two sects together,

579
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:53,780
maybe we'll realize this old ambition of our ancestors'.

580
00:41:55,330 --> 00:41:56,150
This wasn't necessary.

581
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,570
Madam Kou has already agreed to join forces.

582
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,260
I had a whole speech prepared.

583
00:42:05,930 --> 00:42:07,410
But that's great to hear.

584
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:12,000
We'll drink to the alliance then.

585
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,440
Actually,

586
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:30,880
joining forces isn't the most important thing to me.

587
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:33,890
Of course not.

588
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,740
It's only a beginning.

589
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:37,180
How can someone as ambitious as you

590
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:39,070
be happy to keep playing second fiddle to Prince Fu?

591
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,830
Please don't make fun of me.

592
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,650
But it's true that there is something

593
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,680
that's been bothering me.

594
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,460
I wonder what it is about Yun Xiang,

595
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:04,630
my fellow disciple,

596
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,350
that makes Master favor him.

597
00:43:08,070 --> 00:43:08,790
And it's not just Master,

598
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:11,470
but even you favor him, don't you?

599
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:14,210
What do you want?

600
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:20,940
Back when I was begging you to marry me,

601
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:23,860
you chose to leave Lingyuan

602
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,970
just to turn me down.

603
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,110
I haven't been able to get over it.

604
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,270
You're helping me take over the position of Sect Master.

605
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,660
I should return the favor.

606
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,590
Let me help you with what's between you

607
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:51,250
and my sister.

608
00:43:57,390 --> 00:43:58,230
Heart Devouring Powder?

609
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:05,440
Why don't we get intimate today

610
00:44:06,190 --> 00:44:07,540
to celebrate the alliance?

611
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:08,840
Don't you dare!

612
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:50,180
I'm actually not that interested in you.

613
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:55,530
What really interests me is,

614
00:44:57,270 --> 00:45:00,020
when Yun Xiang learns that you've become my woman

615
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,010
and have been under me,

616
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,110
how is he going to feel about it?
