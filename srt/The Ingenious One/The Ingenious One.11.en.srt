Yes.

This is such a big loss.

What should we do?

Everyone.

10
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,570
I've sent someone to investigate the rumor

11
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,460
about the attack on the trade caravan.

12

There is no conclusive news yet.

Any merchant who fails to redeem the raw silk

16
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,010

Why do you sigh?

00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,800
Since ancient times, planners have always

187
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,910
pretended to be bad at the things they are good at

188
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,740
and concealed what they have utilized.

189
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,880
A planner's intentions must be hard to read

190
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,400
and he must only strike after he has planned.

191
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:06,590
Only then, can he win in a single move.

192
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,110
No matter how you avoid the topic,

193
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,410
you cannot hide the fact that people from Yuntai are hardhearted.

194
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,840
My lady was right.

195
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,200
In your eyes,

196
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,910
everyone is a pawn.

197
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,360
No one who has achieved greatness in history

198
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,700
has done so by prioritizing one moment over another.

199
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:31,930
As for the Su family's caravan, the coachmen drove

200
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,630
the carriages and the escorts protected them.

201
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,600
Everyone was doing their job.

202
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:37,610
It was no different from what they usually do.

203
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,580
It's just that they happened to walk into

204
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,670
a part of my plan.

205
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,970
If something had really gone wrong,

206
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,400
I would have heavily compensated for it.

207
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,840
In your eyes,

208
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,410
money can solve everything.

209
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,280
You can make up for lost pawns with money.

210
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:58,700
But what if you lost close pawns like

211
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,860
Shu Yanan and Jin Biao?

212
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,010
How will you make up for them?

213
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,580
Do you have a better way, Mr. Qian?

214
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,380
Or

215
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,710
even if Qi Tianfeng wins the battle of raw silk,

216
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,070
the Su Family

217
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:19,930
still has a way to escape unscathed

218
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:21,530
and safe?

219
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,100
So you mean

220
00:14:35,170 --> 00:14:36,390
I should thank you instead?

221
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:38,860
Shouldn't you?

222
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,470
That remains to be seen.

223
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,220
If the raw silk can safely

224
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,820
arrive at the dock today,

225
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,170
you'll be safe.

226
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:57,160
Otherwise, I will take that

227
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,120
intelligent head of yours.

228
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,120
Have you checked the raw silk inventory

229
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,420
of the Cao Sect?

230
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,000
We've done it as you said.

231
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,440
But we don't understand.

232
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,400
Now that the pledge cannot be fulfilled,

233
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,220
the price of in-stock raw silk will increase.

234
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,220
Why are you in a hurry to sell them now?

235
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,000
An item bought at a discount is already cheaper.

236
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,290
An item sold during a price hike is already more expensive.

237
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,170
This is a business trick.

238
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,610
You don't need to understand it.

239
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,000
Just do as you're told.

240
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:55,770
Yes.

241
00:15:56,170 --> 00:16:01,760
[Nandu Chamber of Commerce]

242
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,370
Mr. Qian.

243
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,190
Steward Ding.

244
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,750
Have a seat.

245
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,230
The deadline on the 15th has arrived.

246
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,480
Here's the pledge for 30,000 catties of raw silk.

247
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,800
According to the pledge, you need to pay 195,000 taels of silver.

248
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,520
I didn’t expect the Cao Sect

249
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,370
to acquire almost half of the pledge

250
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,320
distributed by the Chamber of Commerce.

251
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,440
Cash on delivery.

252
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,310
Mr. Qian, I'm sure you won't make things

253
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,830
difficult for an errand runner like me.

254
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,060
Please go back and tell Master Qi,

255
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,040
if he can make a comeback one day,

256
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,890
I hope he knows that

257
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,270
there's no guarantee of winning in this world.

258
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,550
His ambition has blinded him.

259
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:00,520
He didn't notice that he was in imminent peril.

260
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,070
Steward Ding,

261
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:06,569
take your 30,000 catties worth of pledge

262
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,150
and exchange them for raw silk outside the Eastern City gate.

263
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,180
All 30,000 catties of them

264
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:14,750
are top-quality silk.

265
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:22,119
[Pledge]

266
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:22,990
Later,

267
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:25,079
Steward Ding will bring tailor Wang over.

268
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:26,940
Don't stand on ceremony.

269
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:28,319
Pick the best fabric.

270
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,280
Everyone gets a new set of clothes.

271
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,490
If you have a wife and kids,

272
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,430
they get new clothes too.

273
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,000
Tell everyone.

274
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:35,980
OK.

275
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,730
Thank you, Master.

276
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,310
Steward Ding.

277
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:41,180
Your Master.

278
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:44,970
We're in trouble.

279
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,300
I held the pledge and thought about it while walking.

280
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,460
I thought the Su family must be bluffing.

281
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,500
But when I arrived at the city gate,

282
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,700
the containers were piled up higher than the walls.

283
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,090
How did they manage to import the goods?

284
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:03,770
The Su's caravan was burnt to crisps.

285
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,630
It's impossible to use the river channels.

286
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,980
The only option left was the sea route.

287
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,930
But the imperial court has banned sea activities for decades.

288
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,900
Even without the military guards,

289
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,660
where did the Su family

290
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,980
get so many cargo ships?

291
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:18,890
No, wait.

292
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,990
There was a rumor this morning

293
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,090
that pirates entered the river last night.

294
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,170
Could it be them?

295
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:32,530
Your Master.

296
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,110
We guarded against land and river transport,

297
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,290
but we never thought they would take the sea route.

298
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:40,900
This is bad.

299
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,120
We betted with everything Cao Sect has.

300
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,380
Get up!

301
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:51,800
Stand up!

302
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:56,870
The Cao Sect does not shed tears.

303
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,310
For this deal,

304
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:14,320
the raw silk took 30,000 taels.

305
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,330
As for hiring the pirate ships...

306
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,580
That bastard, Master Guan, dared to blackmail me.

307
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:22,340
He demanded 20,000 taels for payment.

308
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,920
Qi Tianfeng borrowed about

309
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,700
50,000 to 60,000 taels in total.

310
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:30,090
We...

311
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,380
We invested over 100,000 taels of silver.

312
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:37,600
How much is the business of the Cao Sect worth?

313
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,040
You don't understand.

314
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,090
The Cao Sect's business

315
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,770
can't be bought with money.

316
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,020
Besides,

317
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:47,700
the Su family owes me a big favor this time.

318
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:49,890
It can’t be repaid with money either.

319
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,490
Anyway, in the war of raw silk,

320
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:58,270
the biggest beneficiary is us, Guanghui Bank.

321
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,900
What benefit did Mr. Yun get?

322
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:12,860
Was all this just to deal with Qi Tianfeng?

323
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,950
You've raised a good point.

324
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,890
He planned everything with utmost care.

325
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:24,170
In the end, what did he leave for himself?

326
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,910
He left a message before leaving.

327
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,160
But I don't understand it.

328
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,490
What did he say?

329
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,700
He told me to keep you safe.

330
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:41,660
Master.

331
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:47,660
Master Qi of the Cao Sect is here.

332
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:48,620
He wants to see you.

333
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,530
Tell him to wait.

334
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:50,700
Yes.

335
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,630
Yun Xiang must be referring to him.

336
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,160
The Iron Hand Demon.

337
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,860
I finally get to face him in a fight.

338
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:05,950
Kid.

339
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,550
Look at you, all raring to go.

340
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,810
Let me tell you.

341
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,330
This person is no ordinary master.

342
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,090
How about this?

343
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,650
Let the shadowman suppress him first.

344
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:16,100
Then, you can take him down when you get the chance.

345
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:17,320
Uncle,

346
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,650
I'm looking forward to it.

347
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,990
His palms technique is known for its vicious strength.

348
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,170
By fighting him,

349
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:26,060
I can improve on my Transforming Palms.

350
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,270
Mingyu.

351
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,850
Where are you hurt?

352
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,050
Sister.

353
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,310
I'm fine.

354
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:58,980
It's all somebody else's blood.

355
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,660
I'm tired.

356
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:06,860
Mingyu!

357
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,030
What's wrong with Mingyu?

358
00:22:12,690 --> 00:22:13,530
Something's wrong with him.

359
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,900
I think he should be fine.

360
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,040
Young Master has always been kind.

361
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,300
He must have killed someone.

362
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,010
Let's give him some time to himself.

363
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:30,300
By the way, my lady.

364
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,810
Warrior Jin and Miss Shu

365
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,130
are waiting for you inside.

366
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:40,980
This is...

367
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,220
A  small leader of the Cao Sect.

368
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:43,930
He's called Xie Guang.

369
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,730
He set fire to the raw silk.

370
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,250
Which fire?

371
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:53,300
The one in Yufeng Warehouse,

372
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:54,770
or the one with the caravan?

373
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,300
What does it have to do with the Yufeng warehouse?

374
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:07,300
Of course it's this time.

375
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,660
Your brother is also stubborn.

376
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,730
He won't give up even without the goods.

377
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,810
He insisted that we follow the Cao Sect

378
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,160
and nab a member back with us.

379
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,540
Mr. Su said we can only report

380
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,940
to the authorities if we have a witness.

381
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:21,180
By doing that, even if you go bankrupt,

382
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:22,460
Qi Tianfeng won't be able to rest in peace.

383
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:23,980
But I told him that

384
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,620
this person wouldn't talk so easily.

385
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,490
He refused to believe me.

386
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:27,430
Forget it.

387
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:29,200
It's nothing important.

388
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:31,700
Chairperson Su,

389
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,570
we almost died this time.

390
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:36,980
We didn't bring the raw silk back.

391
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,660
I won't ask for the goods escorting fee.

392
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,610
But I killed at least 30 people

393
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,670
to protect your brother.

394
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:45,010
That will be 10 taels of gold per kill.

395
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,730
Hero Jin, you risked your life in the fight.

396
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,980
I'm willing to pay double.

397
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,530
Thank you, Chairperson Su.

398
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:54,540
Miss Shu.

399
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,000
How should I repay you?

400
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,760
According to the trade contract,

401
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,630
if the armed escorts lose the goods,

402
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,070
not only do they not get any payment,

403
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,360
they must also pay for the lost goods.

404
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,610
But they lost a lot this time.

405
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:15,800
If they still have to compensate for the goods,

406
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,760
I'm afraid the Armed Escort Agency will close down for good.

407
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:20,270
Once a contract is made, it must be followed.

408
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,480
This is the rule of business.

409
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,360
But I can thank you in my own name.

410
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,760
I will return the compensation sum

411
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,140
and make the agreed payment.

412
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:30,930
As for any dead or injured escorts,

413
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,310
I'm willing to compensate their families.

414
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,290
No wonder you've been in charge of the Chamber of Commerce for so many years.

415
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:40,290
You're a chivalrous person.

416
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:41,810
I admire you.

417
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,940
Please keep your promise.

418
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,060
We'll be leaving now.

419
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:51,930
Did you know about this before?

420
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:56,840
This caravan was a bait for Yun Xiang to make a diversion.

421
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,150
If you knew,

422
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,420
why did you risk your life for it?

423
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:03,690
Yun Xiang...

424
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,130
is capable of anything.

425
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:07,980
Fortunately, the result is not bad.

426
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,400
You'll get used to it.

427
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:23,350
Young Master.

428
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,270
Two ladies have been waiting for you

429
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,060
at the backyard door for a while now.

430
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:50,540
Miss.

431
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:03,980
I shall go back first.

432
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,170
You're hurt.

433
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:17,460
Don't touch it.

434
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,260
It's all blood.

435
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:22,780
It's dirty.

436
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,330
You've never seen me like this, have you?

437
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,480
Don't worry.

438
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:36,860
It's all minor injuries.

439
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,150
Your magnolia protected me.

440
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:46,680
You sound so calm.

441
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:51,540
But you must have suffered a lot.

442
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,070
Tell me about your trip

443
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,340
someday.

444
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,850
You might not like it.

445
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,340
The world is full of heroic emotions.

446
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,700
I used to love

447
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:16,090
reading about them in books.

448
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:23,140
I didn't expect you to be a hero too.

449
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,180
It's been some long tiring days.

450
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,140
Let me buy you a drink.

451
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:39,220
It'll relieve your fatigue.

452
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,240
You're only buying me a drink after earning so much?

453
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:44,000
You should at least treat me to a boat dinner.

454
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:45,850
Let's do that next time.

455
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,100
I'll go back to Liansheng House first.

456
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:49,730
I know why you're going back.

457
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,540
You're probably wrong.

458
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:53,310
You're either going to meet someone,

459
00:27:53,450 --> 00:27:54,530
or wait for someone.

460
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,140
Miss.

461
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,020
I think you have one too.

462
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,000
Your hands never shake when you behead people.

463
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,870
Yet you blush when she smiles at you?

464
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,160
Let's go. I'll lend you some courage.

465
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:13,590
Miss Shu.

466
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:18,410
Jin.

467
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,500
I'm glad you're back safely.

468
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,320
She insisted on coming with me.

469
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,980
But she doesn't say anything now that she's here.

470
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,700
How about I buy everyone a drink?

471
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,960
I need to tend to some chores at the Liansheng House.

472
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,670
Go ahead.

473
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,170
I'm tired too.

474
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:48,670
Let's drink.

475
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,700
You're busy. You can't go.

476
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,650
What am I busy with?

477
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,180
Rest early.

478
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,450
You must be tired.

479
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,470
You can just treat Tianhu to a drink instead.

480
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:08,990
Miss Ke, let's go back to Liansheng House.

481
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,500
Jin.

482
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:25,300
I won't drink today.

483
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,120
I have to help with work when I get back.

484
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:30,360
Okay, it's up to you.

485
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,720
For now, we...

486
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,290
Let's take a walk.

487
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:39,870
I've been in Nandu City for years.

488
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,710
But this is my first time

489
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,180
strolling on the street like this.

490
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,030
You're not in a rush,

491
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,340
why can't you take a stroll?

492
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,890
It's a little embarrassing,

493
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:52,780
but people of our background

494
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,300
don't feel completely safe

495
00:29:54,750 --> 00:29:55,790
even in broad daylight.

496
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,860
Let's stroll to your heart's content today.

497
00:29:59,230 --> 00:29:59,910
I'll protect you.

498
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:11,550
[Peace and Virtuous]

499
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,470
Jin.

500
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:08,690
Where is your hometown?

501
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,700
It's a bit complicated.

502
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,240
[Liansheng House]

503
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:51,980
Mr. Yun.

504
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,540
Miss Shu is taking a bath inside.

505
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,180
I was just leaving for a brief moment,

506
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,360
so I didn't lock the door for her.

507
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:08,460
Tianhu.

508
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:10,720
Give him the hot water.

509
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:12,300
Go back and rest.

510
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,310
Slide the bucket in.

511
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,700
My life-long innocence,

512
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,330
ruined in an instant.

513
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,960
Have you ever been innocent?

514
00:32:28,730 --> 00:32:29,890
You called me here in such a hurry.

515
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,360
You must have something urgent to tell me.

516
00:32:32,030 --> 00:32:33,440
I met Su Huairou just now.

517
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,500
Although she didn't say it outright,

518
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,030
I think

519
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:41,540
she has figured out the whole story.

520
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:43,580
What makes you think so?

521
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,090
I don't know. It's just my instinct.

522
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,490
But my instincts are always accurate.

523
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,440
Yanan.

524
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,020
Can you promise me one thing?

525
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,660
Just tell me what you want to do.

526
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,860
If Qian Rong wants to kill me,

527
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,860
don't do anything.

528
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,350
In case you lose your life.

529
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:30,260
Did he come to you?

530
00:33:32,590 --> 00:33:34,230
I thought with my skills,

531
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,840
I could protect myself within ten moves.

532
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,710
But I couldn't even last one exchange with him.

533
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,310
I didn't expect

534
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,970
him to be such a skilled fighter.

535
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:49,090
So...

536
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,580
You must...

537
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,670
Why are you looking at me like that?

538
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:47,080
I'm fine.

539
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:50,909
What about you?

540
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,699
I'm still in front of you.

541
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,170
What if I didn't come back?

542
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,580
I shouldn't have asked.

543
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,500
I've been like this for decades.

544
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,780
I've never been safe.

545
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,340
My survival depends on luck.

546
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,240
This time was no exception.

547
00:35:28,610 --> 00:35:29,700
I just want to know.

548
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,260
If I did not make it back.

549
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,820
Neither did Jin Biao

550
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,990
nor Su Mingyu make it back.

551
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:40,940
Will your heart

552
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,750
still remain unmoving?

553
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,770
You're right. You're insanely smart.

554
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:57,950
You want revenge,

555
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,680
so you must focus on the big picture.

556
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,260
It doesn't matter if others die in vain.

557
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,400
As long as your wish comes true.

558
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,210
Did you know?

559
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:27,840
These past few days,

560
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,660
I couldn't sleep well.

561
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:32,730
I've always been calm.

562
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:35,760
So I kept imagining

563
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,880
what would happen to me

564
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:39,700
if something happened to you.

565
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,060
I thought I would be numb

566
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,580
to the pain after a few times.

567
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:48,440
But no.

568
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:51,780
I don't believe you.

569
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,890
Who knows how many people you've deceived

570
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,010
with your sweet talk.

571
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,280
Do you ever speak the truth?

572
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,700
You still think I'm lying to you now?

573
00:37:04,530 --> 00:37:06,020
You said your instincts are the most accurate.

574
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,690
Look at me and answer me.

575
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:15,280
Am I lying to you?

576
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,780
I can't tell.

577
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:36,500
How about now?

578
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,710
People from Yuntai must not fall in love.

579
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:50,500
You broke a rule.

580
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,080
Maybe I've lost

581
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,580
ever since that gaze in Baiju Town.

582
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:00,800
Nonsense.

583
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,530
If someone from Yuntai wants to hide something,

584
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,940
they can hide it till they die.

585
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:09,350
I thought I knew everything.

586
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,200
I thought I could devise a strategy for every situation.

587
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,530
But you, and only you.

588
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,440
You're too hard to figure out.

589
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,240
Have you figured me out now?

590
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,610
You always say that I only know how to lie

591
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:30,690
and set up everything.

592
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,760
Then why are you willing to risk your life

593
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:34,450
for such a person?

594
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:43,940
What are you doing?

595
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:47,960
I'm a little afraid to

596
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,230
look into your eyes.

597
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,330
Forget it.

598
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,970
There's no need to say it if you don't say it now.

599
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,500
♫Yumen mountains stack together♫

600
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,800
♫Beacon towers spread all over the mountains♫

601
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,310
♫People depended on beacon fires on the frontier♫

602
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:33,510
♫Horses disappeared into the mountains♫

603
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:39,410
♫Spring and rain are in our hearts♫

604
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:45,500
♫Locking two doors to our hearts♫

605
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,780
♫More wrinkles appear on my forehead♫

606
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:52,060
♫I was so anxious♫

607
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:55,320
♫I feared the wind would blow away my fate♫

608
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,690
♫People come and go♫

609
00:39:58,910 --> 00:40:02,050
♫Turning around once in a lifetime♫

610
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:05,080
♫From now on, the door to my heart♫

611
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:10,110
♫Will not entertain anyone else♫

612
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,480
♫The fading sunlight is reflected in the water♫

613
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,750
♫Half the river was seemingly red♫

614
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:20,280
♫A pity in the third night of September♫

615
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,350
♫The dew looked like pearls and the moon like a bow♫

616
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:28,620
♫Rain poured in our hearts♫

617
00:40:28,970 --> 00:40:32,150
♫Locking two doors to our hearts♫

618
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:33,110
People may look at us as companions

619
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:35,310
♫More wrinkles appear on my forehead♫

620
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:35,210
or partners.

621
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:38,600
♫I was so anxious♫

622
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,370
At first, I also thought that

623
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:40,230
we were just returning the favors.

624
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,960
♫I feared the wind would blow away my fate♫

625
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,270
You helped me and I helped you.

626
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,380
♫People come and go♫

627
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,570
How about now?

628
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:49,430
♫Memories that cannot separate are the most regretful♫

629
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,050
What do you think?

630
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:56,570
♫The deeper the love, the more fate tortures us♫

631
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:54,810
You broke a rule.

632
00:40:56,810 --> 00:41:00,090
♫The wind blows tens of thousands of miles♫

633
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:03,330
♫Swinging the whip, I ride the horse into battle♫

634
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:08,800
♫I only hear sighs tonight in the tall building♫

635
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,670
I have no regrets.

636
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:12,430
♫People come and go♫

637
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,730
♫Leaving only two disappointing lines of poetry♫

638
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:24,060
♫The deeper the love, the deeper one falls♫
