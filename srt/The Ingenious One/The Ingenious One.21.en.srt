Uncle,

5
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,449
why is the letter to Master so hard to write?

6
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,260
If you have decided to form an alliance with Young Master Xiang,

7
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,590
you just have to leave out the details.

8
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,270
If you still don't trust him,

9
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,820
then just tell Master everything.

10
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,250
Based on what he has done recently,

11
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:22,000
are you still afraid Master will sit back and do nothing?

12
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,329
How could I not know that?

13
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,350
I just don't know

14
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:31,130
whether I should trust him or not.

15
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:34,620
But when the both of you came back from Shangxin Pavilion yesterday,

16
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:35,970
you guys were clearly chatting happily.

17
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,060
I thought you have already made up your mind.

18
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,660
You know exactly what Yun Xiang is up to,

19
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,010
right?

20
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,900
After investigating this for so long,

21
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:47,980
things are finally coming to light.

22
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,290
But the more I investigate,

23
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,060
the more I think the real murderer

24
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,640
is no ordinary person.

25
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:55,620
Either it involves the court,

26
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,650
or it involves the Lingyuan Sect,

27
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,340
or both.

28
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,040
If that's the case,

29
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,760
if we let Young Master Xiang continue investigating,

30
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,300
we will attract a lot of trouble.

31

Uncle,

32
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,830
why don't you tell Master

33
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:12,100
and drive him out of Nandu

34
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,030
to prevent any further troubles?

35
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,890
If Yun Xiang is really like Wen Cong,

36
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,200
I wouldn't hesitate.

37
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,680
But somehow,

38
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,340
I always want to protect him again and again.

39
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,180
You are a man from Yuntai who has yet to break off from your affections.

40
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:31,860
No wonder you are not valued by Master.

41
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,940
Who cares?

42
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:39,510

43
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,800
you are compassionate and loyal.

44
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,640
You did not hesitate to deceive the Master a few times.

45
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,260
But how much do you know about Yun Xiang?

46
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,890

47

Didn't Mr. Tang say to hand over the money in silver certificates?

Why is it all in silver taels?

58

These silver taels are 50 taels per ding.

00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,330
I know.

189
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,010
It's my honor

190
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,040
to share your burden.

191
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:19,570
I have no choice.

192
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,970

Didn't you hear?

195
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,420
This place is a thieves' lair.

196
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,670
They are all a bunch of bandits!

197
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:29,360
No way. This place has been running for more than ten years.

198
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,520
It looks like a proper business.

199
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,220

201
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,570
How can you tell that?

202
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,630
They burglarized the Nandu Prefecture Treasury.

203
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,240
They were caught red-handed this time.

204
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:38,660
Really?

205
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,500
I was going to find you.

206
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,670
You left for an entire day without telling me.

207
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:52,920
What happened?

208
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,080
I'm fine.

209
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,180
Something happened to Guanghui Bank.

210
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,040
Kang Qiao is waiting for you.

211
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,300
Was the money sent here first?

212
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:02,740
Yes.

213
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,140
I thought something was amiss,

214
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:05,090
so I drove them away.

215
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,960
Yun, you are finally...

216
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,930
You said Mr. Mo was arrested at 9AM.

217
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,160
You only came to Liansheng House at 3PM.

218
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,580
Where have you been for the four hours in between?

219
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,470
Mr. Mo asked me to find you immediately.

220
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,980
But I ascertained that the first priority was to take down Tang Xiao,

221
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,420
so I took my men to Tang's Residence.

222
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:34,250
That's wise.

223
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:36,350
Tang Xiao is dead.

224
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,780
He died in the Tang's Residence cellar.

225
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,000
He was dismembered with a knife and died a tragic death.

226
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,650
There were several female corpses next to him,

227
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,250
who all died with knife wounds on the neck.

228
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,130
Judging from the wound, it looks like suicide.

229
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,460
All of these don't matter.

230
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,430
What matters is what you did with the bodies.

231
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,270
They were all taken away.

232
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:51,930
Good.

233
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:55,540
There's room to turn this around.

234
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,760
Mr. Mo will definitely defend himself,

235
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,000
saying that Tang Xiao framed him.

236
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,100
According to the law,

237
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,940
Tang Xiao must show up in the court

238
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,380
and testify against Mr. Mo,

239
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,370
before the court can convict him.

240
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,180
If the officials found

241
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,410
Tang Xiao's body first,

242
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,680
they would most likely think that

243
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,490
Mr. Mo wanted to kill him in order to silence him.

244
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,160
Stealing from the treasury is not an ordinary case.

245

The Magistrate of Nandu, Shao Yiheng,

246
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,020
is a well-known corrupt official.

247
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,730
It's very likely that in order to protect his position,

248
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,070
even if he can't find Tang Xiao,

249
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,390
he will fabricate imaginary charges

250
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:29,700
to make Mr. Mo take the blame.

251
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:32,390
Don't worry. Let me think of a solution.

252
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,070
When will you come up with a solution?

253
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,520
Mr. Mo is suffering in prison.

254
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,870
He's not as relaxed as the both of us.

255

256
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,030
you know who is behind Tang Xiao.

257
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,460
You're the one who provoked Tang Xiao,

258
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,500
but the one who is imprisoned is Mr. Mo.

259
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:52,770
What would you do

260
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,380
if I can't come up with a plan?

261
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,920
I don't want to say anything more.

262
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,620
I'll go back and gather the shadowmen.

263
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:00,370
If you don't have a plan,

264
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,580
I will personally see to it before dawn.

266
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,730
if you go against the government,

267
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:08,330
you are breaking the rules.

268
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,120
How dare a person like you talk about rules with me?

269
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,430
Stop waiting here.

270
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,190
Get back to work.

271
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,590
He'll tell us when he comes out.

272
00:15:38,890 --> 00:15:40,680
But I've never seen him like this.

273
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,950
Something must have happened to Mr. Mo.

274
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:49,640

275
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:54,680
Tang Xiao is dead.

276
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:17,370
Mr. Yun.

277
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,120
Mr. Yun, this...

278
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:05,970
What happened?

279
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,230
The theft of the silver taels and the framing

280
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:09,730
wouldn't be a serious enough issue to make you this upset.

281
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,530
Have you ever had a dream where

282
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:19,440
you kept trying to open your eyes,

283
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,240
you thought you were awake,

284
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,880
but later you realised

285
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,040
you are still in the darkness,

286
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,630
again and again.

287
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,780
I seldom dream,

288
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:39,860
but I want to hear you talk about it.

289
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,000
I can see the truth.

290
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,330
I saw that it was very close to me.

291
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,190
It was very clear.

292
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:56,340
I reached out my hand, grabbed it,

293
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,610
and clutched it in my hand.

294
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:07,060
I want an answer.

295
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,940
I want a clear answer.

296
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:10,800
It either is,

297
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,640
or it isn't.

298
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,010
There should be only one answer.

299
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,230
Then I open my hand,

300
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,200
and it's empty.

301
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,180
Did you find the murderer behind the massacre at the Luo family's village?

302
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:12,090
Tell me who it is.

303
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:15,030
I'll kill him to avenge you.

304
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,210
If so,

305
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,410
it means that I'm extremely foolish.

306
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,840
I can't even tell a friend from a foe.

307
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,720
What do you mean?

308
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:34,950

315
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:04,080

But I bet she didn't expect that

336

her dearest daughter is already used to her new identity.

337
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,040
I'm afraid she even forgot her surname is Kou.

He has no time to think about other things.

346
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,730
Why would he vent his anger on you?

347
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,920
You have no idea.

348

He's so cold that

it gives me chills.

350
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,050
Instead of guessing blindly on your own,

351
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:18,760
why don't you ask him directly?

352
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,660
There'll be less misunderstandings.

00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,500
receiving generous love from you and Mingyu

373
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,360
is more than enough.

374
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,810
I can't accept this betrothal gift.

375
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,060
Don't be silly.

376
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,660
After receiving this betrothal gift,

377
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,220
you are now the daughter-in-law of the Su family.

378
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,670
Thank you, Sister.

379
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:37,210
No need to thank me.

380
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,900
I have always known that

381
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,610
you are smart and sensible.

382
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,740
After what happened last time,

383
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:46,200
Mingyu has indeed grown up a little,

384
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,960
but the world of business is ruthless.

385
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:53,520
Therefore, the Su family will still depend on you.

386
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,060
With you around,

387
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:00,020
Mingyu has become more and more responsible.

388
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,400
Don't worry, Sister.

389
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:03,090
Yes, Sister.

390
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,560
I've also learned a lot recently.

391
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,910
I will learn well from you by being at your side in the future.

392
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,390
I will definitely make great progress.

393
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,190
This is for you.

394
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:20,400
[Nandu Chamber of Commerce]

395
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:25,400
[Official correspondence from the Nandu Chamber of Commerce]

396
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,350
There is no faster way to improve

397
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,700
than to put in hard work in the business world.

398
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:29,380
Sister,

399
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,000
why did you

400
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,790
give me the chairmanship for no good reason?

401
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,370
How am I supposed to do a good job?

402
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,680
I also didn't immediately know everything at first.

403
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:38,820
Don't worry.

404
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,190
I've found a teacher for you.

405
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,520
Take me to Young Master Xiang.

406
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,420
Mr. Luo.

407
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,270
Chairman Su, you don't look like you are here to ask for forgiveness.

408
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,000
That's not the point.

409
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:18,190
I've prepared two generous gifts for you.

410
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:22,980
Sister, Yun,

411
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,490
what are you all talking about?

412
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:27,800
Just listen.

413
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,150
There's a past incident that

414
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,580
I had planned to keep to myself forever.

415
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,310
Because once it's exposed,

416
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,240
the Su family's enemies

417
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,230
will be more than just Yuntai.

418
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,450
I would like to hear more about it.

419
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,090
On the 1st day of February, in the 24th year of Tianqing,

420
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:01,730
my father

421
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,460
met a guest of unknown origin.

422
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:11,170
[15 years ago]

423
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,450
Your plan is indeed brilliant.

424
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:13,770
But how dare I easily spread rumors of

425
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,220
the Imperial Court starting a sea ban?

426
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,070
Besides the fact that it's a serious crime that will exterminate my entire family,

427
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:24,710
I don't even have a single piece of evidence.

428
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,870
Wen Cong won't be fooled easily.

429
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:34,420
Who says there's no evidence?

430
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,200
Whether to open up sea trade

431
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,500
has been a focal point of discussion

432
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,120
within the court these past few years.

433
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,300
What you are holding is the petition letter of

434
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,970
nearly 100 officials from last month.

435
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,850
I was too young back then,

436
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,510
so I wasn't interested to hear more.

437
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,890
According to what happened afterwards,

438
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:03,340
I guessed my father

439
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,790
did not trust the petition.

440
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:08,210
The events afterwards were just as you expected.

441
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,270
The merchants knew that if there was going to be a sea ban,

442
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,530
it will certainly set off a storm.

443
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,260
Hence, there was a wave of land buying.

444
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:16,380
Of course,

445
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,360
Wen Cong, who was blinded by greed, would never miss it.

446
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,540
But after the refutation letter came from Beidu,

447
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:26,160
Wen Cong had already taken a great hit

448
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,720
and had no way back.

449
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,710
Therefore, even though you had deduced about 80% of what happened,

450
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,620
you had no way of knowing

451
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,180
how my late father spread the rumor of the sea ban.

452
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,270
I guess the past I had mentioned just now,

453
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,940
has a clear cause and effect.

454
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,790
You have told a great story.

455
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,640
But even with this information,

456
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:51,440
it can't prove that the massacre at the Luo family's village

457
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,410
wasn't done by your father.

458
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:57,070
Yun,

459
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,180
why would my father be related to the Luo family's village?

460
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,800
So you also know about the Luo family's village?

461
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,440
How much do you know?

462
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:05,350
Young Master Xiang,

463
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:07,660
you promised me.

464
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:09,650
Don't worry, Chairman Su.

465
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:13,180
You don't have to interrupt.

466
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,600
After listening to your deduction,

467
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,120
I would be lying to say that

468
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:25,660
I don't have a single doubt about my father.

469
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,810
Businessmen tend to be greedy for profit.

470
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:30,910
But, I can guarantee that

471
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,640
Mingyu and I know nothing about this.

472
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,010
If this was really the actions of my father,

473
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,290
what is your intention?

474
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,260
Are we supposed to make up for our father's mistake?

475
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:44,330
It is hard to say.

476
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:48,110
I came here alone today

477
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,820
because I'm sure you're a reasonable person.

478
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,460
You know a little about Qian Rong's skills.

479
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,290
If the officials come to know that

480
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,300
the fire at Yufeng Warehouse was caused by you,

481
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,420
it's going to be difficult for you to leave unscathed.

482
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:06,800
Are you threatening me?

483
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,230
So what if I am?

484
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,540
The fact that you came to seek your personal revenge

485
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,890
is already against the rules of the sect.

486
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,280
Yuntai will never interfere.

487
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,590
Sister, Yun,

488
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,460
there must be a misunderstanding.

489
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:21,650
How could things be like this?

490
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:22,850
Misunderstandings

491
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:25,460
can't undo the current dead knot.

492
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:26,970
That's true.

493
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,550
But I brought two gifts.

494
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:34,110
Maybe you'll be more interested in that.

495
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,280
I also want to know what kind of gift

496
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,720
can revive the 313 innocent lives

497
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:41,830
of the Luo family's village back then.

498
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:49,290
At this point, I hope you can still consider the present.

499
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,810
As I expected,

500
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,950
although you may have a thousand ingenious ideas,

501
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:55,620
you have nothing against the officials.

502
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,740
My first gift to you is therefore,

503
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,470
to help you save Guanghui Bank's Mr. Mo.

504
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,420
Sure.

505
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,530
Chairman Su,

506
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,070
can you do me this favour?

507
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,420
Sister,

508
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:19,960
this is no child's play.

509
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:20,940
It can't be taken seriously.

510
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,980
You've already heard

511
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:24,590
a good deal of what's been said.

512
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,180
If you go to Uncle Qian,

513
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,390
he will tell you

514
00:32:27,550 --> 00:32:29,880
how to get Mr. Mo out of prison.

515
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:33,750
Why are you hesitating?

516
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:35,990
You call yourself a martial artist?

517
00:32:36,390 --> 00:32:37,660
There's no sense of responsibility from you at all.

518
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:38,500
No...

519
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,600
Go immediately.

520
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:48,760
Yun,

521
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,980
I don't know why things turned out this way,

522
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,380
but she is my sister after all.

523
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,670
Please don't...

524
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:02,850
Don't you worry.

525
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:19,940
The second gift from Chairman Su

526
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,600
is to make Su Mingyu the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce.

527
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:24,910
That's right.

528
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,100
The tragedy of the Luo family's village

529
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,650
did happen during the land purchasing fiasco in the east coast.

530
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,150
The Su family can hardly absolve ourselves from the blame.

531
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,580
I can’t give you the truth you seek,

532
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:44,480
so I can only compensate you with all my property.

533
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,050
I hope you'll be satisfied.

534
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,010
I've transferred all of the Su family's assets

535
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,640
to Mingyu.

536
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,000
Also,

537
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,020
the paperwork for the Chamber of Commerce has just been completed.

538
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:58,940
Mingyu will be the chairman on my behalf.

539
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,490
However, he is still young.

540
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,860
He can't convince the public.

541
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,930
He will still need someone to assist.

542
00:34:06,340 --> 00:34:09,550
Therefore, you are free to use

543
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,300
all of Su family's connections and money,

544
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:12,790
Of course,

545
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,860
if you want to replace him,

546
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:17,880
that is also not completely out of question.

547
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:22,860
That is very sincere.

548
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,070
But before I decide whether or not to accept,

549
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,630
I have one last question.

550
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:40,020
I'm afraid neither of us

551
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:45,190
want to hear that name.

552
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,159
That is...

553
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:50,610
the Lingyuan sect.

554
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:01,320
Young Master.

555
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,200
How could a place as quiet and remote as the Luo family's village,

556
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,350
have anything to do with Lingyuan?

557
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:17,760
I've said everything I can.

558
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:21,290
Indeed,

559
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,160
in all possible sense,

560
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,820
my father was the prime suspect.

561
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:30,780
But it's hard to investigate the past.

562
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,330
The truth may not be what you think it is.

563
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,540
Now that you have my Su family's lifeline

564
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,860
in your hands,

565
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,180
why can't you let it go

566
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,270
and look for other possibilities?

567
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:02,970
Miss Su,

568
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:07,130
I admire how you conduct yourself

569
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:10,540
with such wisdom and broad-mindedness.

570
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:23,950
You may leave.

571
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,220
Yes.

572
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,960
Young Master, the dishes are all here.

573
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:45,820
Sister,

574
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:49,370
this Longjing shrimp is known as the best in Nandu.

575
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:50,320
Try it.

576
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:52,480
Just two people,

577
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:54,630
but twelve dishes?

578
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,750
You don't find it enough?

579
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:57,970
Let's order some more.

580
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:58,920
Yuewu.

581
00:36:59,010 --> 00:36:59,260
Yes, Sir.

582
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,180
Stop right there.

583
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,200
What do you want exactly?

584
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,250
It's been three years since my sister left.

585
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,450
It's a rare meeting.

586
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:16,030
I want to treat you well as your brother.

587
00:37:16,930 --> 00:37:17,730
What's wrong with that?

588
00:37:18,530 --> 00:37:19,380
I want to ask

589
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,090
why are you here?

590
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:23,830
Why did you suddenly appear in Nandu?

591
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:26,530
What exactly do you want to do?

592
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,460
That's an interesting question.

593
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,240
Half a month ago, someone sent word that

594
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:36,090
someone from Yuntai came to Nandu again,

595
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:37,780
and caused a lot of chaos.

596
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:38,850
As for this matter,

597
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:41,480
I obviously hate Nangong Fang for letting it go

598
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:42,240
and doing absolutely nothing about it.

599
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:44,380
But surprisingly,

600
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,520
that girl beside Young Master Xiang

601
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,390
seems to look just like the eldest daughter of the Lingyuan Sect's master.

602
00:37:58,910 --> 00:37:59,540
Sister,

603
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,680
you approached Young Master Xiang

604
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,450
for the benefit of our sect, right?

605
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,420
My alliance with Young Master Xiang

606
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,880
is to obviously suppress

607
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,380
the expansion of Nangong Fang's influence.

608
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:13,590
Well said!

609
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:16,700
Nangong Fang is getting more and more presumptuous.

610
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,270
Even his lackey,

611
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,720
the captain of Nandu, Ye Xiao,

612
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,630
dares to pay me lip service.

613
00:38:24,950 --> 00:38:27,310
If we let them establish their foundation step by step,

614
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:30,260
the master of Lingyuan sect might just really change.

615
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,920
So you burglarized the treasury,

616
00:38:32,330 --> 00:38:34,070
in order to seem like you are helping Ye Xiao deal with Yuntai,

617
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:35,840
but you are actually just disturbing Nandu,

618
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:38,080
so as to disrupt Nangong Fang's deployment.

619
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,580
Isn't it such a good plan?

620
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,470
How foolish!

621
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,230
What kind of person is Nangong Fang?

622
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:45,350
The Kou family and him has always kept each other in check,

623
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,610
carefully balancing our powers between a fine line.

624
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,800
Whatever you are doing is just declaring war to him.

625
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,410
If he makes any changes,

626
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,220
there will definitely be internal strife within Lingyuan.

627
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:56,660
But what Young Master did is all for the sake of the sect.

628
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,180
Shut up.

629
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,240
My sister has been away from home for three years,

630
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,190
traveling around all alone.

631
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:07,750
Before you left, you said that

632
00:39:07,930 --> 00:39:10,620
you would find a good way to have checks and balances against Nangong Fang.

633
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:12,710
You think I'm stupid?

634
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:15,050
Is your so-called good idea

635
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:18,140
that weak Young Master Xiang?

636
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,440
Of course.

637
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,630
I also heard that he has some tricks up his sleeve.

638
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:25,960
I just want to remind you that

639
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,150
although Nangong Fang is our enemy,

640
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,840
the Yuntai Sect is even more so.

641
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,730
Why don't you let me stay in Nandu to assist you?

642
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:37,470
Once that Young Master Xiang completes his mission,

643
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,360
I'll kill him for you.

644
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:41,900
What do you think?

645
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:53,970
[Liansheng House]

646
00:39:52,450 --> 00:39:55,590
You cannot afford a single mistake when dealing with the government.

647
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,460
Remember what Uncle Rong taught you.

648
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,160
Don't worry, I have remembered it all.

649
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:03,660
Are you really leaving?

650
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:05,670
The luggage is in the car.

651
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,060
If we set off now,

652
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,420
we will leave the city before it turns dark.

653
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:10,930
You're leaving today?

654
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,160
You don't care about me anymore?

655
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:16,870
Look, you are being childish again.

656
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,910
I know you always settle matters decisively

657
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:23,470
without regret.

658
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:24,900
But this time,

659
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,780
can we wait a little longer?

660
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,300
This time, it's my turn to be willful.

661
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:34,780
I want to travel around the world.

662
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,840
We share the same blood.

663
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,270
You loved going around all corners of the country,

664
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,730
and so do I.

665
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:44,690
This time I can go out

666
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:46,880
and see the mountains and rivers.

667
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:51,490
Got it, Sister.

668
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:54,720
Miss Ke,

669
00:40:56,540 --> 00:41:00,160
from now on, you are the mistress of the Su family.

670
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,390
You must take care of yourself.

671
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,930
Overseeing the entire Su family is a really difficult task.

672
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,480
I feel assured

673
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,790
to leave Mingyu in your hands.

674
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,770
Don't spoil him.

675
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:21,930
Sister, come back often.

676
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:27,310
If you feel uneasy when you are out and about,

677
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:30,150
come back early.

678
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:34,680
Home is wherever my heart is at ease.

679
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:39,720
Perhaps one day, I may come back.

680
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,000
Maybe,

681
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,210
I will never come back.

682
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:53,850
But no matter where I am,

683
00:41:56,790 --> 00:41:58,480
both of you will always be in my heart.

684
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,600
My lady, it's time to go.

685
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:07,460
Otherwise, we can't leave the city.

686
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,260
Uncle Qian,

687
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,460
you must ensure Sister's safety.

688
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,100
Take care of yourself too.

689
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:49,450
You liked to admire the sunset ever since you were a kid.

690
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:53,530
You liked reciting Li Yishan's poems.

691
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:58,810
Now, I enjoy the tranquility after the sun sets.
