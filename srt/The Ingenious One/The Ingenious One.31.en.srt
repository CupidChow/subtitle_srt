00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:46,950
In this way,

6
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,150
I cut off the cash flow of Mo Bufan

7
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,259
and destroyed Guanghui Bank.

8
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,580
The rumor spread.

9
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,890
The reputation of the Su family was ruined.

10
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:59,729
I think no merchants in Nandu dare to cooperate with them now.

11
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:01,480
Wonderful.

12
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,860
It is said that merchants in Nandu

13
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,140
are very smart.

14
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:07,390
But when compared to you,

15
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:09,880
they are all dwarfed.

16
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,470
Should we think about what to do

17
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,820
with the royal supplier selection?

18
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,290
Exactly.

19
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,180
But there is a problem.

20
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,790
I wanted to take this opportunity to buy

21
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:25,120
the Su family's craftsmanship of silk organza.

22
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,130
Unexpectedly, Su Mingyu

23
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,350
was too resistant

24
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,490
to hand it over.

25
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,920
Then this should be

26
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,680
a piece of cake for you.

27
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,250
I have a plan.

28
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,530
But I need your help.

29
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:47,050
The Su family is still hanging on

30
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,390
because it has many businesses under its name.

31
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,420
It can regain its cash flow sooner or later.

32
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,530
All we need is an order from the government

33
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,400
that uses rectifying the market order as a pretext,

34
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,690
forcing the Su family to close its businesses.

35
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,970
I believe within half a month,

36
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,940
the Su family will collapse.

37
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:09,410
Do you know the current situation

38
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,900
for the government and for me?

39
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,590
I know a little.

40
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,470
I'm walking a tightrope.

41
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,700
Last time I asked for the two imperial decrees for you

42
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,760
to suppress the Su family.

43
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:25,020
It triggered a lot of criticism.

44
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,060
Sorry for implicating you

45
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,160
because of my incompetence.

46
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:31,270
Get up.

47
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:31,960
Get up.

48
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:33,890
Get up.

49
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,260
It's because of the changes of the situation

50
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,090
but not you.

51
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,350
It's just that we need to stay as far away as possible from

52
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,380
all the government departments

53
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,170
and the Weaving Division.

54
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:46,620
I understand.

55
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,980
In fact, the Su family is barely afloat.

56
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:51,800
One more strike can tear it down.

57
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,310
However, although Dafeng Bank

58
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,810
still has 400,000 taels in the treasury,

59
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,380
I have to be prepared for Mo Bufan's counterattack.

60
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,510
So I can't use this money for now.

61
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,660
Therefore, please allow me

62
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,020
to mobilize money from Yangzhou

63
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,620
to prepare for the royal supplier selection.

64
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,430
How much do you need?

65
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,340
Since it's a duel with the Su family,

66
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,150
I've decided to win over silk providers and weavers

67
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,019
in Nandu with a high price

68
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,250
so that Su Mingyu can find no one to use.

69
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,209
Plus, we need money for connections.

70
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:23,030
I need more than 150,000 taels.

71
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,040
For things concerning money, you can be in charge.

72
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:32,520
But it involves a large amount of money.

73
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,260
I hope you can keep a low profile

74
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:38,070
so that there won't be any gossip.

75
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,840
What should I do?

Please give me some advice.

77

Why don't you sort out

78
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:46,730
all your businesses in Yangzhou

79
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,940
and gather all the spare money

80
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,940
of each business.

81
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,920
In this way, it won't disturb the business of Yangzhou

82
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:00,840
or attract the attention of the merchants.

00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,520
made such a request before.

86
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,700
Is there anything fishy about this?

87
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,440
What's more suspicious is that

88
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,620
you agreed without any hesitation.

89
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,150
Good. You've made some progress.

90
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,120

91
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,630

96

Just as you predicted,

97
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,840
he decided to do as I said.

98

Your Highness's eloquence.

100
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:53,510
I didn't expect Nangong Fang

101
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,080
would agree so easily.

102
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,720
Nangong Fang may be despicable,

103
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,830
but he has to obey

104
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,970
my father's orders.

105
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,540
But Nangong Fang...

106
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,520
You wanted him to gather all his assets.

107
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:10,480
What for?

108
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,510
Nangong Fang has countless businesses.

109
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,400
It will be time- and energy-consuming

110
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:15,700
to tackle them one by one.

111
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,570
Also, it'll be easy to alert Nangong Fang.

112
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,340
I see.

113
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:22,740
The process of gathering all his money

114
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,670
to one place

115
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,510
is very complicated.

116
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:27,350
Nangong Fang needs to sort things out

117
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,510
and keep a record.

118
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,760
So, we just need to get this

119
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,100
account book,

120
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:35,850
and we can know all his businesses.

121
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,020
This is a good idea.

122
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,870
And it's easy to implement.

123
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,630
Nangong Fang agreed to do so.

124
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,100
But judging from his temperament,

125
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:46,700
he will be fully prepared.

126
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,610
If anything happens,

127
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,920
he will destroy the evidence.

128
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:53,520
It will be hard for us to find out his businesses then.

129
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,060
So, we can only take this account book by strategy.

130
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,300
We don't have to take it.

131
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,580
There are other ways.

00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,140
Mr. Yun.

133
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,990
Thank you for your help.

134
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:12,160
But there's one thing I don't understand.

135
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,140
If Nangong Fang is from Lingyuan Sect,

136
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,370
aren't you afraid of his revenge?

137
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,460
It's my honor

138
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,900
to share your burden.

139
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,630
I hope you

140
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,510
can fulfill my wish

141
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:27,170
as we agreed.

142
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,340
Don't worry.

143
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:32,110
I've always kept my word.

144
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,220
But Yun Xiang,

145
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,970
Nangong Fang must be fully prepared.

146
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,830
Are you sure you want to go alone?

147
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:42,300
Don't worry.

148
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,090
I have a perfect candidate to go with me.

149
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:47,990
You want me to go to Yangzhou with you?

150
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:48,790
Yes.

151
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,750
Do you really think I don't know about

152
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,480
what happened in Guanghui Bank last night?

153
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,950
You can't deal with Nangong Fang in Nandu.

154
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,070
And now you're going to his base.

155
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,080
In a crisis, we should try to win with unexpected methods.

156
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,100
I have a plan.

157
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,840
It's risky.

158
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,400
But if it works,

159
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,920
we'll defeat Nangong Fang once and for all

160
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,860
and make sure you can become the next

161
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,930
Lingyuan Sect's master.

162
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,020
But for this plan to work,

163
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,190
I need your help.

164
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:20,900
Tell me about

165
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,660
how to make me the next master.

166
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:27,860
First, we need to find out what businesses Nangong Fang has

167
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,560
in Yangzhou and even the entire Jiangnan.

168
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,180
If you can control

169
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,570
all his businesses

170
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,789
and hand them over to Madam Kou,

171
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,770
what kind of feat will it be?

172
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,550
What's the plan?

173
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,480
Tell me about it.

174
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,050
This is the situation you want.

175
00:09:03,670 --> 00:09:04,740
What's your next plan?

176
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,660
Take a rest and wait.

177
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,320
Based on your understanding of Yun Xiang,

178
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,240
what will he do next?

179
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:16,200
He's good at turning failure into success.

180
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,010
He's unpredictable.

181
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:21,140
His opponents are often caught off guard.

182
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,720
Turning failure into success?

183
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,180
It sounds intimidating.

184
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,020
I can only stay put.

185
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,480
I'll deal with him when he makes moves.

186
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,500
I'm waiting.

187
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,520
You must be waiting too.

188
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,790
Mr. Nangong.

189
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,620
Stop talking nonsense.

190
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,310
Aren't you waiting

191
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,580
for Madam Kou's reply?

192
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,120
Don't blabber.

193
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,770
To be honest,

194
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:58,800
even if you tell Madam Kou my every move,

195
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,660
and even if she knows

196
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,520
I allied with Prince Fu,

197
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,770
so what?

198
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:20,670
Uncle.

199
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:22,810
What?

200
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,420
People are here to recover their debts?

201
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:25,620
No.

202
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:27,270
Master summoned us urgently,

203
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,370
demanding we go back now.

204
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,570
How many secret reports did I send him?

205
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:33,950
He didn't reply.

206
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,700
As soon as something happened to Guanghui Bank,

207
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,220
he wanted me to go back to punish me?

208
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:37,700
No.

209
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,460
Let's go, uncle.

210
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,090
Don't be so petulant.

211
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,120
If we're late,

212
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,400
it'll be harder to explain to Master.

213
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:46,010
Hurry up. Let's go.

214
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,610
Master urgently summoned us.

215
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,260
Kang Qiao and I will go back to Yuntai first.

216
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,030
Take care.

217
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:09,880
I was asked to protect you.

218
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,330
But I always can't find you.

219

If you die,

220
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,720
should I return

221

222

223
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,270
would you like to drink with me?

224
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,380
Didn't you quit drinking?

225
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,440
Today is special.

226
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:30,110
Cut to the chase.

227
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,280
What's going on?

228
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,890
Are you willing to risk your life with me?

229
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,620
You're quite straightforward this time.

230
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:45,930
Make it clear.

231
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,020
Why are we risking our lives?

232
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,500
I need to go to Yangzhou.

233
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,300
This trip is going to be very dangerous.

234
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,420
I wanted to bring Kang Qiao.

235
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,420
But he and Mr. Mo have left Nandu.

236
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:59,300
So, I had no choice but to come to you.

237
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,020
Cut the crap.

238
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,030
Since we're risking lives,

239
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:01,950
who can be faster than me in swordsmanship?

240
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:06,550
But you have attachments now.

241
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,890
If you don't want to go, I won't force you.

242
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,310
Maybe I can find more escorts.

243
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:13,430
Come on.

244
00:12:14,990 --> 00:12:15,300
How about this?

245
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,830
Tell me

246
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,420
all your secrets.

247
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:23,470
If you can't,

248
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,660
then entrust your life

249
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:26,840
to those escorts.

250
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:30,090
My secrets can't be explained

251

within a few cups of liquor.

252
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:33,780
Wait.

253
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,040
I'll get two more jars.

254
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:53,620
I'm done.

255

We have to hit the road tomorrow.

256
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,830
So, you agreed?

257

Now you know

the whole story.

259

You should be aware of

how dangerous this trip is.

261
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,520
I knew you have secrets.

262
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:14,250
I didn't expect so many.

263
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,180
Your surname should be Luo.

264
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,230
Yes.

265
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:22,990
My name is Luo Wenjia.

266
00:13:28,450 --> 00:13:29,470
When can we come back

267
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:31,420
from Yangzhou?

268
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,340
If it goes well,

269
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,590
we can be back in three days.

270
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:36,590
Fine.

271
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,760
Ten taels of gold a day.

272
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,070
Shouldn't it be

273
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:42,700
10 taels of gold every mission?

274
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,190
You can't find swordsmen easily nowadays.

275
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,150
Can't I increase the price?

276
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:49,860
Of course you can.

277
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:54,720
Deal.

278
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:11,900
It has been a long tour.

279
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,770
Did you find anything this time?

280
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:15,810
Yes.

281
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,020
Let's meet Yun Xiang later.

282
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,600
Yun Xiang left the city with his swordsman.

283
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:22,570
Where did they go?

284
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,700
The people around him are very discreet.

285
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,320
I haven't found their whereabouts yet.

286
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:29,880
After I entered the city,

287
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,350
I noticed that everyone's talking about Guanghui Bank.

288
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:32,370
Yes.

289
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,990
Because of the bank run,

290
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,190
Guanghui Bank went bankrupt overnight.

291
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,610
Mo Bufan has gone missing.

292
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,520
The Su family was also deeply implicated

293
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:39,360
and suffered huge losses.

294

Any other information?

295

On the night Prince Fu arrived in Nandu,

296
00:14:43,700 --> 00:14:44,710
he was almost assassinated.

297
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:46,810
The assassin was the woman of Lingyuan

298
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,460
who was imprisoned.

299
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,050
What about Princess...

300

How are Princess and Prince?

301
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:54,990
Are they hurt?

302
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,950
They are safe and sound.

303
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,970
The suspect is injured.

304
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,930
Without help,

305
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,760
how could she escape from the prison?

306
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,410
Has Yun Xiang been there?

307
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:09,410
Before the incident, Yun Xiang went to Shao's Residence to look for Princess.

308
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,320
Magistrate Shao was there at that time.

309
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,100
You can tell me about

310
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:16,340

311

317
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,210
have you figured out how to explain to Master?

318
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,610
Even if I can come up with 10,000 solutions,

319
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,690
I can't fool him.

320
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:46,580

so I hurried back.

328
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,680
Were other disciples summoned back too?

329
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,030
I heard that Qin Shiyi in Yuezhou,

330
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,880

377
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,420
You seem careless.

378
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,940
But actually, you remember everything.

379
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:17,080
I've seen shameless people like you.

380
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,250
But I've never met anyone

381
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,630
who's shameless but not obnoxious

382
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,700
other than you.

383
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:26,100
I'm flattered.

384
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:27,680
But don't worry.

385
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:29,320
I'll pay you

386
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,790
this time.

387
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:32,420
You...

388
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:36,190
You always appear to be cunning

389
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,580
and afraid of opening your heart to others.

390
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,100
I didn't understand you before.

391
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,370
But I knew although you're ruthless and brutal,

392
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,010
you never hurt your friends.

393
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,540
After knowing your sad life last night,

394
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,670
I realized why you disguised yourself in this way.

395
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,470
Your heart

396
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,040
is still warm.

397
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,260
Trust me.

398
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,090
I've never misjudged people.

399
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,230
Only after I met you did I realize that

400
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:09,560
there is loyalty towards friends in this world.

401
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,800
Fine.

402
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:12,840
Don't say those cheesy words.

403
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:17,330
From now on,

404
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:18,830
be honest with me.

405
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:19,810
Say what you want to say.

406
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,240
Don't try to trick me.

407
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,600
Okay, I promise.

408
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:25,780
How? Tell me now.

409
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,990
How about we become sworn brothers?

410
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:31,400
You are my elder brother.

411
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,080
I'll buy you a drink after we come back.

412
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:44,020
Is he that girl's younger brother?

413
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,160
What's his name again?

414
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,990
Young Master of Lingyuan Sect, Kou Yuanjie.

415
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,380
We need to make an alliance with him for our mission.

416
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,110
But you must be careful.

417
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,300
He is also the greatest danger during this journey.

418
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,220
Don't worry.

419
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,910
He can't hurt you under my watch.

420
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,680
Look at him.

421
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,330
He doesn't look like his sister at all.

422
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,790
If that girl has a sister

423
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,840
instead of a brother,

424
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:13,980
do you need me to protect you this time?

425
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,770
I don't want to talk to you about this.

426
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:17,700
You don't understand.

427
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:19,660
I didn't.

428
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:20,900
But I'm different now.

429
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,100
[Yangzhou City]

430
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:43,510
We just want to find a place to stay.

431
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,640
What are you doing wandering

432
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,400
in these alleys off the beaten track?

433
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,980
Spies of Nangong Fang

434
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,690
are all over the bustling places in Yangzhou.

435
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:51,710
We can't go to those places.

436
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:52,990
Is it safe here?

437
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,510
I more or less know

438
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,850
his deployment in Yangzhou.

439
00:20:57,530 --> 00:20:58,990
This road is absolutely safe.

440
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,100
You have your own informants?

441
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,700
Otherwise, why did Mr. Yun bring me along?

442
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:11,610
Here we are.

443
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:22,320
It's a bit shabby.

444
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,650
Hope you don't mind.

445
00:21:24,410 --> 00:21:26,010
It's okay. This is only for a temporary stay.

446
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,700
Shall we take action tonight?

447
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,530
Let's wait.

448
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,640
Let's figure out what's going on first.

449
00:21:33,730 --> 00:21:34,800
Then eat and drink

450
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,180
to refresh.

451
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,100
Here.

452
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,220
You have liquor here?

453
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,380
I have safehouses

454
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,020
in every city of Jiangbei,

455
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,940
each with different uses.

456
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:06,990
But one thing in common is that I have good liquor there.

457
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:13,510
Cheers.

458
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,320
By the way,

459
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,690
you only told me

460
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,250
Nangong Fang would gather money from his businesses

461
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:38,690
but you didn't tell me where the money would go.

462
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:41,800
This is the first thing I need to find out.

463
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:43,830
Do you have any connections? No, thank you.

464
00:22:45,910 --> 00:22:46,740
It's not difficult.

465
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,440
I'll get some rest and contact my informant.

466
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,020
He left alone.

467
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,700
Will he play tricks?

468
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,570
Are you going to drink all the liquor here?

469
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:14,780
Don't worry.

470
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,360
I've observed him carefully.

471
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,460
His martial arts skills are ordinary.

472
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:21,010
Even if I get drunk,

473
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,850
I can take him down in three moves.

474
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,440
Don't forget the people of the Lingyuan Sect

475
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,170
are best at using poison.

476
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,240
Can this work?

477
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,580
It should be able to detoxify all the poison of Lingyuan Sect.

478
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,140
It's settled.

479
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,070
The spy I planted

480
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:04,380
around Nangong Fang is called Yan San.

481
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,690
We'll meet here tomorrow morning.

482
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:07,910
It went so smoothly?

483
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:08,810
Yun.

484
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:10,010
If this works out well,

485
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,580
I should thank you.

486
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,190
I hope you can leave Nangong Fang to me

487
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,730
as you promised.

488
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:16,800
Of course.

489
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,090
All these years, I've been helping my mother

490
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,570
supervise the internal affairs of the sect.

491
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,260
My sister has been traveling around

492
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,350
to look for talents and secret techniques,

493
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,830
hoping to find a solution one day

494
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,990
to deal with Nangong Fang.

495
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,300
That day will come soon.

496
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,400
By the way, Yun,

497
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,110
by helping me,

498
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,440
you are saving

499
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:45,390
Lingyuan Sect from misery.

500
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,580
Then why don't we take the opportunity to break the division

501
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,720
between Lingyuan and Yuntai?

502
00:24:50,770 --> 00:24:52,580
My sister loves you so much.

503
00:24:53,180 --> 00:24:55,350
Then you can be together

504
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:56,480
after we are reconciled.

505
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,410
Do you have to rub it in?

506
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:01,610
Come here.

507
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,430
Drink more and talk less.

508
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:04,660
Here.

509
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:56,970
Young Master.

510
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:58,680
Have a seat.

511
00:25:59,100 --> 00:25:59,400
Yes.

512
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,450
It seems Nangong has treated you well.

513
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,270
Thanks to you,

514
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,860
I can get two salaries.

515
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,200
This is for your tip-off last time.

516
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,570
I heard that Nangong Fang is collecting money.

517
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:27,860
Is that true?

518
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,720
Where is he sending the money?

519
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,040
Young Master, to Nandu.

520
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:35,200
No way.

521
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:38,370
I heard that before he sends the money to Nandu,

522
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,880
he should pool it in one place first.

523
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:51,250
Thank you, Young Master. I shouldn't stay too long.

524
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:51,980
So...

525
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,520
Human nature is really unpredictable.

526
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:57,470
Do you really regard Nangong Fang as your master?

527
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,350
We grew up together

528
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,380
and practiced martial arts together.

529
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,840
Are you leaving the friendship behind?

530
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,480
I heard

531
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:08,080
your seal was taken away by Madam Kou.

532
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,260
So what?

533
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:12,970
Actually, it doesn't matter.

534
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,540
But even if you have the seal,

535
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:18,660
I'm afraid you have no right

536
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,460
to know information about Mr. Nangong.

537
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:26,170
Please don't make it difficult for me.

538
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:27,650
I'll leave now.

539
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,500
I won't tell anyone about this.

540
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,340
Can you leave?

541
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,250
I shall take my leave.

542
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,790
Can you leave?

543
00:27:59,040 --> 00:27:59,810
Young Master.

544
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:00,950
Young Master.

545
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,190
Mr. Yun, please wait a moment.

546
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:04,060
We'll find out very soon.

547
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,380
Please spare my life, Young Master.

548
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,140
I'll tell you everything.

549
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:22,730
That brat

550
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:24,140
is really scary.

551
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,150
Your Highness, you came to Su's Residence

552
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,340
with these banknotes today.

553
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,950
I'm confused.

554
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,620
Don't be so reserved.

555
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:00,720
Sit down and then we can talk.

556
00:29:04,950 --> 00:29:06,650
There were many misunderstandings about what happened before.

557
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:08,750
After thinking about it,

558
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:10,540
my father thinks the Su family

559
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,250
is the best candidate to be the royal supplier.

560
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,560
So, he asked me to send these banknotes

561
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,650
to help the Su family in the selection.

562
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:18,870
Your Highness.

563
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,380
We've heard that

564
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,100
it is your father

565
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,650
who got those two royal decrees.

566
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,870
Although we are just humble businesspeople,

567
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:29,110
we don't want to be manipulated.

568
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,990
I'm sure we have to return the money one day

569
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,840
if we accept it today.

570
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:43,700
Your Highness,

571
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:46,690
I apologize for what we said just now.

572
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:50,080
But I really don't understand your intentions.

573
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:51,430
I dare not

574
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:54,050
accept this money.

575
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,480
You two have your pride.

576
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,480
No wonder Yun Xiang wants to help you.

577
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:09,380
To be honest,

578
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:10,810
it is my father

579
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,070
who got those two royal decrees.

580
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:15,300
He wanted to find a place in the business world of Nandu.

581
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,880
Unfortunately, he trusted the wrong person.

582
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,460
Therefore, he had to change plans.

583
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,500
You just said that this has something to do with Yun?

584
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:22,250
That's right.

585
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,540
Young Master Xiang is helping my father solve a problem.

586
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,640
The reward he wants

587
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:30,420
is to let my father help the Su family get through this.

588
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,980
You just need to prepare for the royal supplier selection carefully.

589
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:36,400
Tell me if you need help.

590
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,110
But remember,

591
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,380
don't tell anyone about this.

592
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:41,920
Your Highness,

593
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,290
what deal did Yun make with your father?

594
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:47,930
Is it dangerous?

595
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,770
You'd better not know about this.

596
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,050
Why does Princess Mingzhu's visit to Su's Residence

597
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,680
make you so nervous?

598
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:10,960
Can't you tell what's going on

599
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:12,770
or are you playing dumb with me?

600
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:16,040
Has Princess Mingzhu been in touch with the Su family?

601
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:21,350
Her visit to Su's Residence is definitely Prince Fu's idea.

602
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,330
Prince Fu asked for royal decrees to suppress the Su family.

603
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:25,760
But now he's supporting the Su family.

604
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,320
Aren't you worried

605
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:29,150
that Prince Fu is giving you up?

606
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:35,270
This reminds me of something.

607
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,740
Prince Fu had never asked about the process

608
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,110
but only cared about the result when he wanted me to mobilize funds.

609
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,340
But this time, he said that he wanted me to keep a low profile,

610
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,680
so I can only use the spare money I have.

611
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,380
What if his true purpose

612
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,170
is to find out

613
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:56,970
how many businesses I have?

614
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,660
If you lose control of these businesses,

615
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,010
Prince Fu will not be the only one to trouble you.

616
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,590
When did you send the order?

617
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,440
The day before yesterday.

618
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,340
I'm afraid the money

619
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:15,820
has been gathered together.

Nangong Fang,

621
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,570
I've warned you.

622
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:20,230
Then who's the one that used Bi Yuewu

623
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:21,710
to lure the official soldier to me?

624
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,760
There is only one way now.

625
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:41,330
Please take my token

626
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,720
and go to Yangzhou immediately.

627
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,710

I'm afraid...

633
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,880
I was just thinking about how to send her away.

634
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,470
The result is certain.

635
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,200
We can't stay in Nandu for long.

636
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,540
While she is not here,

637
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,310
we should pack up

638
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,030

Since Yan San came here,

the rules are getting messier.

Don't mention it.

that Nangong Fang is raising money?

748
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,280
Our men are waiting for us at the pier ahead.

749
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,390
Don't use your internal force.

750
00:43:30,520 --> 00:43:32,000
Otherwise, the poison will spread faster.

751
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:33,940
If I don't use the internal force,

752
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:35,690
should we just wait for being chopped into pieces?

753
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:37,100
Stop talking.

754
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:41,820
Jin, hold on.

755
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:42,860
Kill him!

756
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,230
Jin!

757
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,020
Jin!

758
00:43:56,810 --> 00:43:57,850
Control yourself.
