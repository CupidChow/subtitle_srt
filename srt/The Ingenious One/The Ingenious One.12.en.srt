How did you get it?

00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,750
You went to see Qi Tianfeng?

00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,150
Mr. Yun.

It's the real work of Wang Xizhi.

00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,800
This coral is so beautiful.

13
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,670
I bet it's a tribute to the royal family.

14
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,160
This...

15
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,860
Qi, what is this one called?

16
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,870
The Cauldron of God Gu.

17
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,940
It reminds me of an old friend.

18
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,240
I remember seeing this cauldron at Wen Cong's house

19
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,260
when he feted the merchants in Nandu.

20
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,670
Yeah.

21
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,440
He later gave it to the Chamber of Commerce for auction.

22
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,170
It cost me a fortune

23
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,350

If any government official catches me owning one of them,

27
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,320
my whole family will be beheaded.

28
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,470
Now you're giving them to me as gifts.

29
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,000
I have to doubt your motives.

30
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:48,720

we are both businessmen.

35
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,950
So save me your little trick.

36
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,460
Tell me.

37
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,430
What brought you here?

38
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,390
Just speak your mind.

39
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,580
You're well-informed

40
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,110
of what's going on in the market.

41
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,029
So you should know

42
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,740
that the raw silk of the Su family has entered the city.

43
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:22,780
I lost everything

44
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,140
in this big gamble.

45
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,370
I've heard about it.

46
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,140
So I have no choice

47
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,100
but to give you these treasures

48
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,780
in exchange for something else.

49
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:38,860

If you take them back,

53
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,900
you'll have to

54
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,430
reorganize everything

55
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:55,830

56

earn as much as we do now.

57
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,320
So I have a suggestion.

00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,650
Why don't we make a new deal?

59
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,340
Mr. Mo,

60
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:17,870
if you can lend me some money

61
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:19,420
to help me pay off the debt,

62
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,440
I promise to cut you in for 30%

63
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,220

64
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,620
from today onwards.

65
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,540
Mr. Mo.

66
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:32,900
50-50!

67
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:34,950
In that way, you can get all your money back

68
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,550
in less than three years.

69
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,180
After that, you can sit it out and have a share

70
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,100
of every dime we make.

71
00:05:49,909 --> 00:05:50,620
Qi Tianfeng,

72
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,870
you don't seem to know the score here.

73
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,020
All the assets of the Cao Sect

74
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,150
are in my hands now.

75
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:02,010
I can even say your life

76
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,390
is mine too.

77
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,820
In other words,

78
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,980
every penny I let you keep is a reward.

79
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,920
How could you call this a deal?

80
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,440
I advise you

81
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,510
not to burn your bridges.

82
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,580
Don't burn your bridges.

83
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,090
Isn't that something

84
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,910
Mr. Wen once said to you too?

85
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,610
Have you ever considered cutting him some slack?

86
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:37,180
I am where I am today

87
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,700
because I never believe in fate!

88
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:03,700
Sit down and have some tea.

89
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:15,810
It's exciting.

90
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,940
Why don't you watch it with me?

91
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,140
Once this matter is over,

92
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,159
we'll be even, right?

93
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:36,659
Not even close.

94
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,650
You still need to find the orphans in Jishan Hall.

95
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:40,420
I know. I'll get it done.

96
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:42,140
Tell me.

97
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,790
You caused quite a stir.

98
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,180
What's in it for you?

99
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,540
Besides,

100
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,409
Master ordered you to take down the Su family,

101
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,340
but you helped them make a big fortune.

102
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,220
Don't worry.

103
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,280
I'll explain it to Master.

104
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:57,840
Yun Xiang.

105
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,780
If we join hands again in the future,

106
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,460
I hope you can be honest with me,

107
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:02,550
so I won't make assumptions.

108
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,220
Transforming Palms.

109
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:24,820
Correct.

110
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:29,100
You're so young but have mastered

111
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:31,130
such an evil skill.

112
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,390
What can Transforming Palms do?

113
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,120
Transform.

114
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:38,419
They transform your opponent's power into yours.

115
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,200
So the punch Qi Tianfeng threw just now

116
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,270
ended up landing on himself.

117
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,580
So Kang Qiao is invincible?

118
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,430
One may beat him with weapons with sharp edges.

119
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:48,980
Kang Qiao is lucky.

120
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,540
Qi Tianfeng fights with bare hands too.

121
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:54,710
Back off.

122
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,700
I'll tackle him myself.

123
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,150
If I exert all my strength,

124
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,100
can you still transform it into yours?

125
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,900
Let's find out.

126
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,910
Shadowmen, attack!

127
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,350
Kang Qiao!

128
00:10:10,130 --> 00:10:10,730
Kang Qiao!

129
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,590
K-Kang Qiao!

130
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,010
Sister, help me!

131
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:36,480
Young Master.

132
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,700
Your clothes are dry.

133
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:09,420
Young Master.

134
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,340
Young Master.

135
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,580
The bloodstain won't wash off.

136
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,690
Don't worry, Mr. Mo.

137
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,870
Kang Qiao was protected by his internal force.

138
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,400
The power of that blow was greatly decreased.

139
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,900
He just needs some time for the broken bones to heal.

140
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,400
By the way,

141
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,640
here is a secret medicine.

142
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,820
It's a miracle cure for broken bones.

143
00:13:14,990 --> 00:13:16,280
You're not the one who's in pain.

144
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,560
Here, drink it.

145
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:23,780
No.

146
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,820
It'll disperse my internal force.

147
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,980
Drink it and have a good rest.

148
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,410
Your internal force will come back soon.

149
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,500
No.

150
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:33,620
Without my internal force,

151
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,820
how can I fight Qi Tianfeng if he comes back?

152
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:37,840
Just drink it.

153
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:39,560
I'll take care of the rest.

154
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,830
I didn't raise you to be so reckless.

155
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,760
All you do is get in fights.

156
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,170
You're so combative.

157
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,320
Mo.

158
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,390
Sorry to make you worry.

159
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,820
What should I do if something happens to you?

160
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,830
I don't want to bury you!

161
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:06,700
Mr. Mo, I've got news.

162
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:09,490
Mr. Mo.

163
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,100
Leave Kang Qiao to rest.

164
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,850
Let's talk outside.

165
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,820
Qi Tianfeng fled to one of the Cao Sect's docks

166
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,300
and is hiding in a boat.

167
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,940
He was stumbling,

168
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:24,270
so he must have been badly injured.

169
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,230
He didn't return to the base.

170
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,530
Looks like he's planning to run away.

171
00:14:32,590 --> 00:14:33,340
When I came back,

172
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,580
I saw Ding Yi heading to the dock with a bunch of people.

173
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,220
They are all Qi Tianfeng's trusted aides.

174
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:38,680
Keep a close eye on them.

175
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,220
Report to me immediately if anything happens.

176
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:40,910
Yes.

177
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:51,240
Sorry for what happened to Kang Qiao.

178
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:54,500
I'll go back and find more medicines

179
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,140
that can help him recover sooner.

180
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:02,570
Qi Tianfeng is at the end of his rope.

181
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:05,700
You don't need to do anything now.

182
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,580
I'll take over from here.

183
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,100
Of course.

184
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,220
You'd better not cause me more trouble.

185
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,520
Kang Qiao can't get injured again.

186
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,830
It'd be too much for him.

187
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:18,540
Listen. You should thank god

188
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,760
that the Iron Hand Demon didn't give him a critical hit today.

189
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,250
Or you wouldn't be standing here

190
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,460
and chatting with me now.

191
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,660
It seems that you and Kang Qiao

192
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,670
have a deep connection.

193
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:39,310
Is there a story?

194
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,420
It's none of your business.

195
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:44,950
Wait.

196
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,730
You just said

197
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,420
we need to be honest with each other

198
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,890
if we want to work together again.

199
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,580
Kang Qiao was an orphan.

200
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,820
I pitied him and adopted him.

201
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,890
I later found that he was kind and honest,

202
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,280
so I sent him to study in Yuntai Sect.

203
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,170
He was so talented

204
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,980
that the old weirdo Zhong Beidou

205
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,790
noticed him

206
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:18,410
and insisted on taking him as his last disciple.

207
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,040
Since Kang Qiao was in Yanwu Master's good graces,

208
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,800
he should've stayed at our headquarters.

209
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,300
Yeah.

210
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,540
But Kang Qiao didn't want to.

211
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,740
Five years later, he insisted on coming back

212
00:16:29,770 --> 00:16:31,150
and has stuck around since then.

213
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,890
That old weirdo was so mad.

214
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,390
He went through lots of hardships

215
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,570
but still has a kind and pure heart.

216
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,230
You're lucky to have him

217
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,300
as your right-hand man.

218
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,710
My right-hand man?

219
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,900
I've long regarded him as my son.

220
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,080
What? Don't tell me

221
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,100
you're to remind me that the sect rules

222
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,730
forbid us from forming bonds with others.

223
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:06,710
We indeed have such rules.

224
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:07,980
Nonsense.

225
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,609
We're human.

226
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,720
We have feelings.

227
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:12,670
These feelings are real.

228
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,069
If one doesn't care for the people around him,

229
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,280
how can we count on him to save the world?

230
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:15,819
Mr. Mo.

231
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,810
Careful. The walls have ears.

232
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:19,579
You have ears.

233
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:23,300
You're right.

234
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:26,329
Thank you for your trust.

235
00:17:28,150 --> 00:17:29,620
I'm willing to tell you so much

236
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,180
because you had the guts to disobey Master

237
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:33,010
and let the Su family go.

238
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,360
I think we're the same.

239
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,110
We don't follow rules.

240
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:37,450
Now it's your turn.

241
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,990
Be honest with me.

242
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,140
Tell me about you.

243
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,940
Actually, my story

244
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,340
is similar to Kang Qiao's.

245
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:56,180
That's all you can tell me?

246
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,730
Mr. Wen saved my life.

247
00:18:02,050 --> 00:18:03,410
So Mr. Wen is as important to me

248
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:05,320
as you're to Kang Qiao.

249
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,090
What happened to you?

250
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,110
To tell you the truth,

251
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:15,990
my whole family was killed.

252
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,180
Mr. Wen told me repeatedly

253
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:24,510
that I can't mention my past to anyone.

254
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,580
So you're the only one in the sect who knows about it.

255
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,710
Master doesn't know either?

256
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:38,590
You've been studying in the sect for 15 years.

257
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:42,260
The family that was killed 15 years ago…

258
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,980
You're from the Luo family's village?

259
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:49,740
You know about that massacre?

260
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:53,630
The massacre in the Luo family's village was a sensation.

261
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:55,150
Everyone in Nandu knew about it.

262
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,300
But don't ask me for details.

263
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:57,950
I don't know any.

264
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,080
I told you

265
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:00,540
I'm not close to Wen Cong.

266
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:01,700
I know nothing.

267
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,320
Fine.

268
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,410
Then please

269
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,190
keep this secret for me.

270
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:15,540
It makes sense now.

271
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,190
You raised a lot of dust

272
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,780
with one scheme after another

273
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:23,280
not only to avenge Wen Cong

274
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,700
but also to find out

275
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,730
the truth about the massacre.

276
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,180
I knew it.

277
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,490
It's impossible for anyone

278
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,360
to have no feelings at all.

279
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,510
You're Master's direct disciple,

280
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,100
but you feel hatred just like everyone else does.

281
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:40,920
Mr. Mo,

282
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,100
I told you about my past

283
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:46,830
because I'm sure

284
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,200
that I'll need your help in the future.

285
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:50,430
Wait.

286
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,830
Did I just cause problems for myself?

287
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,050
I won't let you

288
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,050
help me for nothing.

289
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:57,410
Really?

290
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,810
Check carefully.

291
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:04,180
All assets must be recorded.

292
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:05,490
Don't miss anything.

293
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,860
Mr. Tang.

294
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:18,660
Mr. Mo.

295
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,290
What a rare visitor to the Cao Sect.

296
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,860
I'll be a regular here in the future.

297
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,860
What brought you here, Mr. Tang?

298
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,490
Who are you to ask that?

299
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:33,700
Where is Mr. Qi?

300
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,210
He ran away.

301
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,420
If I'm not mistaken,

302
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,660
you're here to collect

303
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:40,760
the large sum of money

304
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:41,980
you lent to Qi Tianfeng, right?

305
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,420
It's a long story.

306
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,570
I'll just grab a few valuable things to cut my losses.

307
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,060
Be careful.

308
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,980
Everything inside is mine.

309
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:54,460
You'll have to pay if you break anything.

310
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:55,700
What do you mean?

311
00:20:57,620 --> 00:20:58,230
Mr. Tang, come here.

00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:04,470

316
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,690
Don't be so conceited.

317
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,930
You're getting carried away.

318
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,180
Mr. Tang,

319
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,420
don't be exasperated.

320
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,900
I'm not exasperated.

321
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:27,760
I heard that Mr. Qi became a total failure

322
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:31,300
all thanks to Mr. Yun's

323
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,620
ingenious strategies.

324
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:34,690
What?

325
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:39,650
Has Guanghui Bank colluded with him?

326
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:40,910
Mr. Tang.

327
00:21:41,990 --> 00:21:43,300
It's just about business.

328
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,500
Collude is not the right way to put it.

329
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,170
You have a point.

330
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:49,940
You have a point.

331
00:21:51,030 --> 00:21:51,800
How about Mr. Qi?

332
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:55,210
Is he dead?

333
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:57,210
Do you wish he were dead?

334
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,840
What a funny question.

335
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,310
[Cao Sect]

00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,220
You guys must find Qi Tianfeng.

337
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,720
Some dirty hands have gotten on the Cao Sect.

338
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,580
We need to wipe it clean.

339
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,220
Understood.

340
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:24,300
Let's go.

[East of town, Qi Tianfeng's old house]

00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:45,590
Master Qi.

343
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,770
You've gotten internal injuries.

344
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:54,430
You need to take a good rest.

345
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,700
I underestimated Kang Qiao.

346
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:01,240
I didn't expect so young a man

347
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,820
to be a master of martial arts.

348
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,160
Mo Bufan is so conniving.

349
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,400
He laid low when we dealt with Weng Cong.

350
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:14,310
Who'd have known he's from Yuntai Sect?

351
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,630
Yeah.

Don't worry.

355
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:29,880
Be careful with the table.

00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:35,920
Don't scratch the tables.

The old furniture is fine.

358
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,000
Why did Mr. Yun dump all of them

359
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,910
and buy new ones?

360
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:45,460
Liansheng House has been closed for too long.

361
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:47,030
It's long been forgotten.

Besides, most gambling houses in Nandu

363
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,680
are under Tang Xiao's name.

364
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,660
If we want to be successful,

365
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:55,190
we have to be creative.

366
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,150
But what purpose can these new tables serve?

367
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,250
These tables are smaller.

376
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,690
so we'll start with small wagers they think little of.

377
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:21,020
Bit by bit,

378
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,080
we'll be popular again.

379
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:23,630
Smart.

380
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,740
We take what is dumped

381
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,270
and offer what is needed.

382
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,180
Mr. Yun brushed us off.

383
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,180
I thought he didn't care about

384
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,150
Liansheng House.

385
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,620
I'm afraid he's up to something else

386
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,980
and we just don't know about it.

387
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:52,140
Well, we haven't made a penny

388
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:55,390
but already spent a lot on the furniture.

389
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:00,740
It's fine.

390
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:03,350
If we do a remodel in the future,

391
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:06,320
these tables can be used as desks for the children.

392
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:08,780
Children?

393
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:10,240
Whose children?

394
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,810
Did You forget what Mr. Yun promised you?

395
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,430
Yun Xiang mentioned those children to you?

396
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:19,180
Is he really going to help me find them back?

397
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:28,330
He's taken it seriously.

398
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,300
He's changed.

399
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,870
What are you thinking about?

400
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,540
I'm thinking about you.

401
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,050
I don't believe that.

402
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:09,930
Let me look at you.

403
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,320
You look much better.

404
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:26,830
Really?

405
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,570
Yes.

406
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,030
Now that you've had enough rest,

407
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,830
maybe you should start looking for Qi Tianfeng.

408
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:44,250
He has nothing now.

409
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:46,090
This is your best chance to take revenge on him.

410
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,410
I'm not in a hurry.

411
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,980
I know you'll need him

412
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,450
to find out what happened in the Luo family's village.

413
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,630
You won't let him escape.

414
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,540
Why don't you tell me more

415
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:58,490
about that incident in the Luo family's village?

416
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,300
So I won't kill Qi Tianfeng

417
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,300
the second I see him.

418
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,580
You won't do that.

419
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,260
You've become much less reckless recently.

420
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,950
But you're still the same.

421
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,830
If I changed for the better too,

422
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,100
would we be together forever?

423
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,390
Alright. Let's get down to business.

424
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,640
Have you already found

425
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:32,620
where Qi Tianfeng is?

426
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,580
There's a dock

427
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,590
20 miles east of town.

428
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:43,740
It was abandoned years ago.

429
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,550
There is a deserted house

430
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,530
near that dock.

431
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,750
It's said to be Qi Tianfeng's first property

432
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:51,960
when he started from scratch.

433
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,220
He's hiding there.

434
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:55,110
20 miles? So close?

435
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,850
Maybe he was injured by Kang Qiao and couldn't travel very far.

436
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:58,980
He may escape again.

437
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,550
I'll go with Ten Taels of Gold

438
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,370
to bring him back right away.

439
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,180
Wait.

440
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,270
He's desperate now.

441
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,460
We must not underestimate him.

442
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:07,430
I can't let just you and Ten Taels of Gold go there.

443
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,900
If that guy from the Su family could join you,

444
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,920
I'd have nothing to worry about.

445
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,040
Mr. Yun.

446
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:19,540
Mr. Yun.

447
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:20,660
Chairman Su is here.

448
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,040
He wants to see you and Miss Shu.

449
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:31,890
Mr. Qian.

450
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:33,730
Go.

451
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:34,800
Okay.

452
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,940
Is Warrior Jin in Liansheng House?

453
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:39,470
Yes.

454
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:40,610
This way, please.

455
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,530
Mr. Yun appears cold-hearted,

456
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:56,990
but after the dust settled,

457
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,590
it turned out

458
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,410
that he pretended not to care

459
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,720
but has arranged everything for us.

460
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,600
He set us up and helped us out.

461
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,800
Don't be fooled by him so easily.

462
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,890
Like you were?

463
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,840
You little brat.

464
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,210
Mr. Qian.

465
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:22,890
Mr. Qian.

466
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,000
Hello, everyone.

467
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,230
Liansheng House is ready to open.

468
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:30,710
Yes.

469
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,610
Are you here to get your money?

470
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,540
Gold is heavy,

471
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,190
so I took a few banknotes.

472
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:42,780
If there's anything improper,

473
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:43,820
please let me know.

474
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,270
It's fine.

475
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:47,380
Banknotes are more convenient.

476
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:47,900
Thank you.

477
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:51,850
Miss Meng Lan,

478
00:29:53,010 --> 00:29:53,680
I need to ask you about something.

479
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,140
What did you say to Mr. Su at the back door

480
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,070
of Su's Residence the day before yesterday?

481
00:30:03,290 --> 00:30:04,770
Sorry. I presumed too much.

482
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,710
I shouldn't have come over uninvited.

483
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,440
Don't get me wrong. That's not what I mean.

484
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:11,260
I just want to know

485
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:13,950
whether there was anything off with Mr. Su that day.

486
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,850
He seemed a bit distracted.

487
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,840
I thought he was tired from the journey.

488
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,120
He didn't say anything special.

489
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,460
He would rather feel sad himself

490
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,580
than make you worry.

491
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,800
Is Mr. Su all right?

492
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,020
What?

493
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,380
He hasn't gathered himself yet?

494
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,040
Warrior Jin, you're used to bloodshed,

495
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,030
but Mr. Su had never seen that before.

496
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,700
After he came back, he couldn't eat

497
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,020
and couldn't sleep.

498
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,550
It's just killing someone

499
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,920
and getting some blood on his hands.

500
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:51,720
How about this?

501
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:53,920
I'll talk to him.

502
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:56,500
You paid me double.

503
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:58,100
I have to do something.

504
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,920
Both I and Miss Su

505
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,730
prefer someone else to do it.

506
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,740
Can I go now?

507
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:13,770
Of course.

508
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,980
The sooner, the better.

509
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:17,260
Thank you, Mr. Qian.

510
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,780
By the way, Miss,

511
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,220
Miss Su said

512
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,060
this time you'll walk in through the front door.

513
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,700
Thank you, Mr. Qian.

514
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,400
Go now.

515
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,860
Chairman Su, I guess you're here

516
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,780
to ask about Qi Tianfeng's whereabouts, right?

517
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,220
He's out of his depth now. I'm in no rush to go after him.

518
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,860
Then what else can I do for you?

519
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,030
I've been interested in business since I was young.

520
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,600
The strategies you used this time

521
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,160
impressed me greatly.

522
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:54,980
I've been trying to put the pieces together.

523
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,500
May I ask you a few questions?

524
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,470
I'm sure you've long

525
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,020
seen through my little tricks.

526
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,390
You flatter me.

527
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,250
It looked like the Su family was cornered by Qi Tianfeng,

528
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:18,140
but I think it's just a plot of yours

529
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,590
to lure him into the trap.

530
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:30,310
The rise of silk price was indeed a big problem.

531
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,610
I could've been voted out as the chairwoman.

532
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:34,520
Things could get worse.

533
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,910
The Su family might not be able to submit the tribute cloth

534
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,060
and lose His Majesty's rewards.

535
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,190
No matter what,

536
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,720
losses were inevitable

537
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:45,180
but the Su family could surely survive.

538
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,900
However, we heeded your advice

539
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:57,010
and sold the deeds.

540
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,460
That was when we put the future

541
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,130
of the Su family at stake.

542
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,160
After Qi Tianfeng knew about it,

543
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,100
he rolled the dice

544
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:15,500
and bought lots of raw silk deeds.

545
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:16,900
As a result, the price was raised.

546
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:21,460
Only one of the Cao Sect and the Su family could survive.

547
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:27,300
Qi Tianfeng easily goes to extremes.

548
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,760
I knew it would work for him

549
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,680
and I didn't have better options.

550
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,700
Fortunately, we won.

551
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:40,240
So let's put it behind us.

552
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:42,730
But there's one thing I don't understand.

553
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,940
Now that we're the winners,

554
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,380
why don't you just let it go?

555
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,020
It's not easy to take the Su family down.

556
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,500
No matter how ambitious Qi Tianfeng was,

557
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,660
he needed to gain the upper hand to succeed.

558
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:01,780
What gave him the upper hand

559
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:04,020
was the fire in Yufeng Warehouse.

560
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,660
I thought since Qi Tianfeng

561
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:08,570
benefited the most from that fire,

562
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,489
he should be the one who set the fire.

563
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,120
Are you implying that someone else did it?

564
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:18,489
I don't have evidence.

565
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,460
But after you capture Qi Tianfeng,

566
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:24,290
please do me a favor and ask him about it.

567
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:26,810
Of course.

568
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,480
Miss Shu.

569
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,500
Your wish has been fulfilled.

570
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:40,340
I returned the compensation from the four Armed Escort Agencies

571
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,580
and paid 20,000 taels of silver

572
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,060
to the escorts' families.

573
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,330
It's very kind of you, Chairman Su.

574
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,310
I merely did what I promised.

575
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:53,050
Miss Su, you almost

576
00:34:53,409 --> 00:34:55,210
lost your life this time

577
00:34:55,820 --> 00:34:58,100
and gave all the escort fee

578
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,620
to those escorts.

579
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,220
You're so much kinder than me.

580
00:35:03,190 --> 00:35:06,230
I know you did that just because you have a warm heart,

581
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:07,940
but others may think

582
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,320
you showed sympathy

583
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,940
because you experienced

584
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:15,860
something no one knows about.

585
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,270
Don't make innuendos.

586
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,570
Just get to the point.

587
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,790
If Qian Rong tries to kill me,

588
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,720
don't fight him.

589
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,370
I don't want you to die for nothing.

590
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,560
Have you heard of

591
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:57,770
Shu's Armed Escort Agency?

592
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,730
It used to be the most famous Armed Escort Agency in Nandu.

593
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,070
Then you should know what happened to the Shu family.

594
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,020
You should also understand

595
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,980
why I treat the dead and wounded escorts so well.

596
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:10,280
Yanan,

597
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,400
don't be rude.

598
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:20,020
So, you're the only one left of the Shu family.

599
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:23,290
If I said anything that offended you,

600
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:24,430
please forgive me.

601
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:41,600
Chairman Su.

602
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,850
She's been through a lot

603
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:45,940
and only survived thanks to her fierce personality.

604
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,660
Please don't take it to heart.

605
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,500
Mr. Yun,

606
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:50,960
I came today to thank you.

607
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,170
I didn't mean for that to happen.

608
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,230
I can't win this game

609
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,820
even if we play until it's dark.

610
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,600
Beat the drum and pass the flower.

611
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,060
Guess how many pine nuts are in the fist.

612
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:06,730
What's so hard about this simple game?

613
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,980
Fill the glass.

614
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,120
I'll show you how to win.

615
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:09,640
Great.

616
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,670
Girl.

617
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:16,080
Is she crazy?

618
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:24,980
Rong,

619
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,490
do you think what Shu Yanan said

620
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,310
is the truth?

621
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,780
I'm not sure.

622
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,700
But if Shu Yanan

623
00:37:34,730 --> 00:37:36,180
really were an orphan of the Shu family,

624
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,850
it would explain

625
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,340
why she helped those escorts.

626
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,550
If that were the case,

627
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,540
it'd be very likely

628
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,920
that she set the fire in Yufeng Warehouse.

629
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:50,870
Shu's Armed Escort Agency was destroyed by Qi Tianfeng.

630
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,040
Yun Xiang may have told her

631
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,460
that by burning down Yufeng Warehouse,

632
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,370
she could avenge her family's deaths.

633
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,420
That would give her enough reason

634
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:04,620
to do something even more terrible.

635
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:06,560
This matter is complicated.

636
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,130
To avoid future troubles,

637
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,640
why don't we find a chance to capture Shu Yanan?

638
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:14,890
No need.

639
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,080
I made myself very clear just now.

640
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,090
Yun Xiang used us this time,

641
00:38:22,770 --> 00:38:23,680
but we got the profits

642
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,910
we deserve.

643
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,790
So it's time

644
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,310
to put the whole thing to an end.

645
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,350
Do you want to kill Qi Tianfeng?

646
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,420
If you do, trust me.

647
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,580
Don't ask anything.

648
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,900
[Yufeng Warehouse]

649
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,510
[Shu's Ancestral Hall]

650
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,280
You did well just now.

651
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,600
Su Huairou came here

652
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,870
to let us know

653
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,470
that she's not a pawn that we can manipulate.

654
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:55,320
Given the circumstances,

655
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,540
even if she knew the truth,

656
00:40:58,780 --> 00:40:59,800
she wouldn't pursue it.

657
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:03,270
Do you think I'm afraid of being killed by Qian Rong?

658
00:41:06,820 --> 00:41:08,090
In the past, I only killed criminals

659
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:10,180
and never hurt innocent people.

660
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:12,140
I'll say it again.

661
00:41:12,770 --> 00:41:14,900
You didn't kill those escorts.

662
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,480
Don't tell me to delude myself.

663
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:22,070
You said that so easily

664
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,750
just because you weren't there

665
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,830
seeing swords going through their hearts.

666
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,180
Their warm blood

667
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:32,350
didn't splash on you.

668
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,600
Because of the fire I set,

669
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,670
they ended up dead in the wilderness.

670
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,580
Many women lost their husbands.

671
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,290
Many children lost their fathers.

672
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:45,850
Calm down.

673
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:48,840
Calm down!

674
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:55,990
Haven't we made an agreement?

675
00:41:57,330 --> 00:41:58,400
You'll just carry out orders

676
00:41:59,100 --> 00:41:59,900
without asking any questions.

677
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,940
So when you went to Yufeng Warehouse that day,

678
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,390
you had no idea what would happen.

679
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,220
But I'm different.

680
00:42:04,970 --> 00:42:06,500
I knew everything from the beginning.

681
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:12,570
That's why I keep telling you

682
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,360
Qi Tianfeng was the one who killed those escorts.

683
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:22,580
I'm not just trying to comfort you.

684
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,140
I'm also lying to myself.

685
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:33,890
If one day,

686
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,080
the ghosts of those escorts come back for revenge,

687
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,920
they won't come at you.

688
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:41,660
They'll come at me.

689
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:47,100
I hope you understand

690
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,460
that many innocent people

691
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,060
were killed by Qi Tianfeng.

692
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,780
If we hadn't taken this opportunity to get rid of him,

693
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:55,810
yeah,

694
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,820
those escorts wouldn't have died,

695
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:00,590
but more innocent people

696
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,300
would've been killed by that bastard.

697
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:07,920
Do the lesser evil to eliminate the greater evil.

698
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,640
Is that how the Yuntai Sect does justice?

699
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:19,830
Before Su Huairou left,

700
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,790
she said the four Armed Escort Agencies in Nandu

701
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,790
are willing to take this chance to kill Qi Tianfeng.

702
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,530
I've asked Ten Taels of Gold to contact them.

703
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,340
But don't worry.

704
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,440
This time,

705
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:37,530
I'll kill him without a single drop of blood being shed.

706
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:42,830
How can you be sure?

707
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:51,810
I have my ways,

708
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,870
or I wouldn't have given you my word.
