Sit there.

5
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:49,570
We sent out all the shadowmen.

6
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,009
And Kang Qiao is leading them personally.

7
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,900
You and I just need to wait here without worry.

8
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,380
They won't return empty-handed.

9
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,450
Mr. Mo,

10
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,770
people who injured their sinews and bones usually have no appetite for food.

11
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,610
Mr. Mo doesn't seem to be one of them.

12
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,110
Food can act as medicine.

13
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,060
One trotter a day

14
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:12,120
will help the wounds heal faster.

15
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,890
Fine, keep eating then.

16
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,510
You'd better buy horse hooves and sheep hooves

17
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,630
and taste them all.

18
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:19,640
Don't try to fool me.

19
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,690
Sheep hooves are considered hot in nature.

20
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:22,870
It's not good for the wounds.

21
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,810
I can't just eat recklessly.

22
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,340
Your days are numbered anyway.

23
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,780
Just do whatever you want.

24
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:30,920
What did you say?

25
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,530
It's true that food can act as medicine.

26
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,810
But Mr. Mo, you know only part of it.

27
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,250
Your wounds were caused by a whip.

28
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,180
You must still be applying the Golden Medicine for injuries, right?

29
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:39,820
Yes.

30
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,500
It's a miraculous medicine used to stop bleeding,

31
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,940
because it contains black cohosh,

32
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,100
sweet flag, and myrrh.

33
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,500
But the most important ones

34
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,020
are the fossilized bones and the male ground beetles.

35
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,190
But the oily collagen of the trotter

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,360
can diminish the efficacy

37
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,780
of the male ground beetles most easily.

38
00:02:58,430 --> 00:02:59,910
So, according to what you said,

39
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,120
you've eaten trotters for so many days;

40
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,660
it seems that pyemia caused by the whip wounds

41
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,270
would be inevitable.

42
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,830
Don't scare me.

43
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,480
I'm fine.

44
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,780
Look at your fingers.

45
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,830
This…

46
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:16,220
What's going on?

47
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:19,520
This…

48
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,300
Pyemia begins exactly with blood stasis.

49
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,070
It looks like the disease has just begun.

50
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,810
Unfortunately, once the disease is developed,

51
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,920
I'm afraid there's no cure for it currently.

52
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:30,820
Mr. Mo,

53
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:32,760
why don't we get down to business?

54
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,280
What business?

55
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,079
Look at me.

56
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,450
Help me.

57
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:38,790
Well,

58
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,700
there are some things in the world that we humans can deal with

59
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,970
and some that we cannot.

60
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,850
We have to deal with them one by one.

61
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,390
Look.

62
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,060
There are more than ten private banks in Nandu, big and small.

63
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,980
Plus, there's Tang's Gambling House and its branches.

64
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,670
Mr. Mo, how many shadowmen do you have

65
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,420
to keep an eye on so many places at the same time?

66
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,450
Don't hit me when I'm down.

67
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,160
Are you trying to find out my situation?

68
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,400
There's no harm in talking about it.

69
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,980
For now, we just need to keep an eye on the Tang's Gambling House.

70
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:11,580
Got it.

71
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,010
Even if they melt the official ingots into silver of small bits,

72
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,660
those will still be some glittering bits of silver.

73
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,760
At this critical moment,

74
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:21,120
depositing such a great amount of new silver into a private bank all of a sudden

75
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,140
will definitely raise suspicions.

76
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,020
So they're most likely to transport this sum of money

77
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,470
to the Tang's Gambling House

78
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,580
in exchange for new money, right?

79
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,740
Is there anything that you don't know?

80
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,580
Besides, there's one more thing

81
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:35,920
that is quite interesting.

82
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,980
Are you going to say that since the silver robbery case hasn't been solved,

83
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,340
why did the government open the city gate

84
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,180
and order to ban the market closure?

85
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,560
Mr. Mo, you are the only one who knows me.

86
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:47,690
The government must be doing so

87
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:49,810
to lure the suspects to appear.

88
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,600
This is quite an ingenious plan.

89
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,860
But if the case can't be solved in the end,

90
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,370
the decision-maker will surely be criticized.

91
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,510
He might even

92
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,230
be accused of neglect of duty.

93
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,480
Shao Yiheng is such a useless person.

94
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,880
He doesn't have that kind of courage or insight.

95
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,820
It must have become a big deal

96
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,860
and the court sent someone here to investigate.

97
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,250
Since you've guessed everything,

98
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,010
are you still going to rob the official silver?

99
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:15,960
Of course.

100
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,400

105
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:24,720
that will be my business.

so I drizzled them over the trotter.

00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,530
You should be clear

186
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,190
that the only person who can join hands with you now

187
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,520
is the person right in front of you.

188
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:17,820
For revenge,

189
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,330
are you really not afraid of anything?

190
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:22,650
Mr. Mo, you are with me.

191
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:24,860
That's also a source of my confidence.

192
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,740
You knew long ago that this would happen.

193
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:29,770
Yes.

194
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:31,910
Or no.

195
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,820
The fanatics of the Lingyuan Sect are extremely vicious.

196
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,510
They framed Mr. Mo and killed my brothers.

197
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,830
I can't just let it go.

198
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:46,100
Now we've already alerted them.

199
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,880
The only clue can no longer be followed up either.

200
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,150
Although the clue we currently have cannot be followed up,

201
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,070
there's still a new clue

202
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,420
that is waiting for us to investigate.

203
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,230
What clue?

204
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,380
Charcoal.

205
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:02,320
Right.

206
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,420
Melting silver requires charcoal.

207
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,550
A lot of charcoal has to be burned in order to melt 100,000 taels of silver.

208
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,750
Mr. Yun, please wait a second.

209
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,170
You and I are fellow apprentices.

210
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,720
Feel free to say what you want to say.

211
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,990
Do you find anything strange about what happened today?

212
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:33,100
I don't know whether the Lingyuan Sect has arranged a master-hand

213
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,970
to secretly protect people who transported the silver

214
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,210
or they knew from the beginning that they would be shadowed

215
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:38,590
and arranged the deployment beforehand.

216
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,190
Are you suspecting that someone divulged the information?

217
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,150
The shadowmen under Mr. Mo

218
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,390
were all born and raised in Nandu.

219
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,860
Our spies are all over the city.

220
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,870
Unexpectedly, Miss Shu was the first

221
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,590
to find a clue about the silversmiths in the black market.

222
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,820
I didn't find the person,

223
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,860
but I stumbled across another piece of information.

224
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:00,570
What is it?

225
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,740
Those silversmiths in Zhushan Street

226
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,020
who helped the robbers dispose and melt the stolen silver

227
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,700
were all hired away overnight.

228
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,210
Do you know where they went after being hired?

229
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,580
I haven't found out yet.

230
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,310
I've already verified the ins and outs

231
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,640
of what happened.

232
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:18,950
There's nothing suspicious.

233
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,830
What is suspicious is that it was too coincidental.

234
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,510
Since you're so suspicious about it,

235
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,430
why didn't you talk about it in Mr. Mo's presence just now?

236
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,470
We should work together when we face a strong enemy.

237
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,090
Mr. Mo is an impatient person.

238
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,160
I'm afraid that if I talked about this in his presence, it would drive a wedge between you two.

239
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,380
Mr. Kang, you are meticulous and thoughtful.

240
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,670
But I have my own judgment

241
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,860
about those around me.

242
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,340
Why are you in the mood to invite me

243
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,410
to drink and enjoy the moon today?

244
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:25,910
I've been feeling tired lately,

245
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,430
but I keep thinking of the wine that night.

246
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,210
I still remember we were by the riverside that day.

247
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,750
You came to see me with some wine.

248
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,930
You meant to comfort me,

249
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,340
but unexpectedly you got drunk yourself.

250
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,830
Just forget these embarrassing things.

251
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,840
Originally, we said we would take revenge together.

252
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,410
I've taken my revenge,

253
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,250
but you haven't yet.

254
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,410
This time, I need to stay

255
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:22,630
and keep an eye on you.

256
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,160
Whatever I said, they were all drunk words.

257
00:15:27,390 --> 00:15:28,280
Stop thinking about them.

258
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,050
It seems that they lost nearly 100 taels again.

259
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:46,380
They probably won't make much profit today.

260
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,730
You're even caring about the revenue of the gambling house today.

261
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,540
This is my shelter.

262
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,510
Of course I care about it.

263
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:57,170
With your ability,

264
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,700
you can find a place to stay anywhere.

265
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:04,780
In fact, to me, Liansheng House

266
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,260
has long been more than simply an ordinary gambling house.

267
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,990
When I was cultivating in the mountains,

268
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:14,090
I always thought I liked peace and quiet.

269
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:15,670
But now,

270
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,140
I miss the bustle and nuances of life here.

271
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,970
If one can forget all the burdens they carry and be a worldly person,

272
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:28,140
of course it would be great.

273
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,030
Yes.

274
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:52,850
Actually, have you ever thought about

275
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,300
where we would be now

276
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,680
if we haven't met each other

277
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,660
in Baiju Town

278
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,430
that day?

279
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,620
Those who are destined to meet will meet someday.

280
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,990
Then, for the encounter between people,

281
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,430
how much of it do you think is the will of Heaven

282
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,130
and how much of it is humans' intentions?

283
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:22,819
I don't know.

284
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,880
I only know that it's hard to go against the will of Heaven.

285
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,610
It's hard to go against the will of Heaven.

286
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,830
It's hard to predict a human's mind.

287
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,120
It's true that we should fully enjoy ourselves when we feel pleased.

288
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:56,760
But I'm a person

289
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,980
who takes drunk words seriously.

290
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,400
What's the matter with you?

291
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:16,330
How was your talk with Mr. Mo?

292
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,710
I haven't heard you mention him for days.

293
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,290
They can no longer follow up the clue they currently have.

294
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,320
Mr. Mo's men were killed.

295
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,460
According to Kang Qiao,

296
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,230
the killer was a young lady.

297
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,010
The weapon she was holding was very strange.

298
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,510
But I've found a new clue.

299
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:43,740
So soon?

300
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:45,050
Yes.

301
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:52,150
Although the Tang's Gambling House is now sealed off,

302
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,210
I found another perfect place

303
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:58,230
to wait for windfalls,

304
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,380
where we can certainly catch the bandits of Lingyuan Sect all at once.

305
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,510
They aren't people of goodwill.

306
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,580
What's your way that makes you

307
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,020
have the matter well in hand?

308
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:35,010
Come with me tomorrow

309
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,290
and you'll see.

310
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,800
Let's drink.

311
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:45,400
Save some for me.

312
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,780
Young lady.

313
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:09,010
Lady Yanan, I failed to protect you.

314
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:10,760
Sorry to let you get frightened.

315
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,470
You're disregarding people's lives.

316
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,600
Young Master often teaches me

317
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,370
that we can't show our mercy

318
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,170
if we don't use tough means.

319
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,740
Lady Yanan, please don't worry.

320
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:24,100
I will dispose of the dead bodies.

321
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,760
You are not my subordinate,

322
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,260
but I still need to teach you today.

323
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:29,330
A fierce wolf kills only for food.

324
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,910
A mad dog kills for no reason.

325
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,660
Everyone is afraid of fierce wolves

326
00:21:32,690 --> 00:21:33,770
and everyone hates mad dogs.

327
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,650
They will all die under the rod.

328
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,950
I'll keep that in mind.

329
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:38,330
Young Master has been waiting.

330
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,730
Lady Yanan, please don't lose track of time.

331
00:21:51,890 --> 00:21:53,480
Sister, I'm really sorry for troubling you again

332
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,030
to deliver the letters late at night.

333
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,390
I wonder if you have changed your taste

334
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,330
after all these years.

335
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:00,930
Kou Yuanjie,

336
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,010
don't put on an act.

337
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,410
You promised me you would sit tight.

338
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:08,210
Why did you order Bi Yuewu to stop the Yuntai Sect from investigating?

339
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,630
If she hadn't interfered,

340
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,580
Ye Xiao would have died by now.

341
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,060
Right, it was my order.

342
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,890
But how would I have thought

343
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,420
that Yun Xiang was so fast?

344
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:21,300
If we don't stop him now,

345
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,370
aren't we going to bury the 100,000 taels of silver

346
00:22:23,630 --> 00:22:24,530
along with Ye Xiao?

347
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,390
Yun Xiang might have become suspicious of me.

348
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:33,700
If he threatens you,

349
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,680
I'll kill him.

350
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,850
I promise no one will know.

351
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:39,600
No need.

352
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,870
I'll just make use of the opportunity

353
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,680
to investigate Ye Xiao.

354
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,250
It's a good chance to dispel his suspicion.

355
00:22:57,870 --> 00:23:00,270
Do you find anything strange about what happened today?

356
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,830
I don't know whether the Lingyuan Sect has arranged a master-hand

357
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,570
to secretly protect people who transported the silver

358
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,330
or they knew from the beginning that they would be shadowed

359
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,620
and arranged the deployment beforehand.

360
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,500
Unexpectedly, Miss Shu was the first

361
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,620
to find a clue about the silversmiths in the black market.

362
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:17,510
What is suspicious is that it was too coincidental.

363
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:20,150
If the person who betrayed you is someone closest to you,

364
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,630
you would also think of her first,

365
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,140
wouldn't you?

366
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,660
You admit that you're one of the Lingyuan rebels?

367
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,850
Three years ago, I traveled around in Ganzhou

368
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,180
and saved a dying disciple of the Lingyuan Sect.

369
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,780
Did you secretly learn their martial arts skills

370
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,000
before finding an opportunity to escape?

371
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:38,870
Yes.

372
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,060
They aren't people of goodwill.

373
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,800
What's your way that makes you have the matter well in hand?

374
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,090
Shu Yanan is the only person I can think of.

375
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,530
It's just that I can't verify that she's an orphan of the Shu family as she said.

376
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,330
I tried many times to test her,

377
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,220
but she didn't give herself away.

378
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,220
Mr. Mo, even if you don't trust her,

379
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:04,900
you should trust me.

380
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:06,500
But I have my own judgment

381
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,030
about those around me.

382
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,140
Yanan.

383
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:13,890
You're smart.

384
00:26:15,610 --> 00:26:16,460
By doing so,

385
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,520
even if he's suspicious of your identity,

386
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,060
it would still be hard for him to guess that you're the eldest daughter of the Lingyuan Sect's master.

387
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,700
If you're related to the Lingyuan Sect,

388
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,310
why would you help him deal with your own fellow apprentices?

389
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:29,910
Sister,

390
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,390
why don't you just stay here?

391
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:35,460
You can cross the river by boat tomorrow morning.

392
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:38,300
Leave the rest to me.

393
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,350
From what I know about you,

394
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,770
this is your real purpose, right?

395
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,460
I'm just worried about your safety.

396
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,800
Worried about my safety?

397
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,940
Mother is old now.

398
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,720
You're worried that I'll compete with you for the position of Sect Master, right?

399
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,250
If you want to compete for it, I can't stop you.

400
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,260
What if I'm really going to compete with you?

401
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,740
Sister, do you remember when we were young,

402
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,380
you brought back a fawn from the forest?

403
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,220
We competed to feed it and held it in our arms to play with it.

404
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:14,680
Later, you were afraid that I would do something out of line.

405
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:16,420
So you didn't allow me to touch it again.

406
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:16,990
Stop talking about it.

407
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,160
Then, I dropped it to death right in front of you.

408
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:28,500
You've really never changed since childhood.

415
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,140

416

and is just waiting for Ye Xiao to buy charcoal.

422
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:06,880
Take care, Sister.

423
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,780
I heard from Jin

424
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,120
that the hairpin you had before was broken.

425
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,040
Use this one from now on.

426
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,420
You need to remember to tell me

427
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,810
about your past later.

430
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,800
Young Master, why are you visiting me late at night?

431
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,240
I'm here to ask about the silver.

432
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,260
A small half of it was melted just now.

433
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,470
This is different from what you said before.

434
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:37,360
Not to mention other things,

435
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,060
the key problem is there's not enough charcoal.

436
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,820
The amount of charcoal in one delivery is only enough for one or two days of burning.

437
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,350
But if the charcoal is delivered frequently,

438
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:44,010
others will easily notice the anomaly.

439
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,230
That's easy to solve.

440
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,450
Just find a couple more places to buy charcoal. You know very well where to buy it.

441
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:52,350
The government has lost silver twice in a few days.

445
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,380
Hurry up and buy charcoal.

Xingyuan Firm is the largest charcoal factory in Nandu.

At this time of the year,

454
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:40,770
no households would need to use a great amount of charcoal

455
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,580
but Xingyuan Firm received a big purchase order.

456
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,160
I reckoned the amount of charcoal

457
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:45,830
they bought before.

458
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,020
It should have almost been used up by now

459
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,040
and it's time for them to buy more.

00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,320
Su Mingyu comes from a family of merchants

545
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,310
but has no interest in business.

546
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,580
How could he be scheming?

547
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:33,370
Look at that man. He walks with a calm gait

548
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:34,350
and maintains his poise.

549
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,720
He must be experienced and astute.

550
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,170
It must be Young Master Xiang.

551
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:38,500
Your Highness.

552
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,510
It is indeed Young Master Xiang.

553
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:41,420
All kinds of people show up

554
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,700
as we shadow the suspects.

555
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,370
Don't underestimate them.

556
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,020
They were most likely the ones who fought with the robbers

557
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:49,500
outside the gambling house yesterday.

558
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,770
As long as we keep an eye on Young Master Xiang, we'll find something.

559
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,070
Split up into two groups.

560
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,310
We need to keep a close eye on both the charcoal wagons and Young Master Xiang.

561
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:00,120
Uncle.

562
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,300
If I had known that shadowing the suspects

563
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,100
takes several hours and is so boring,

564
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:06,100
I wouldn't have come.

565
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,910
Since it's not dark yet,

566
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:10,780
can I go walk around?

567
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,540
If you do this again,

568
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,060
I won't let you come with me next time.

569
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:17,910
Go. Go.

570
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,430
Li Bo, stay with her.

571
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,210
Yes, Sir.

572
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,500
Your Highness.

573
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,490
I've spent all my money.

574
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,490
Let's shop another day. Is that okay?

575
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,310
No way.

576
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:31,680
Find some money if you have no more.

577
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,320
[Liansheng House]

578
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,060
Liansheng House.

579
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,920
Is this Young Master Xiang's gambling house?

580
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:42,620
Yes, this is the one.

581
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,330
I've never been to a gambling house.

582
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:46,460
It's exactly a good opportunity to win some money.

583
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,030
Let's go.

584
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:47,950
Your Highness.

585
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,110
Your Highness, please don't.

586
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:50,980
The imperial court decrees

587
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,140
that females aren't allowed to enter a gambling house.

588
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,190
That is referring to ordinary females.

589
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:00,630
Go away.

590
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:03,710
Miss.

591
00:39:04,030 --> 00:39:05,500
You're so beautiful.

592
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,630
I'll leave him to you.

593
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:19,750
What?

594
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:20,840
You want to stop me too?

595
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,210
Miss, you misunderstood.

596
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,760
The imperial court has imposed a curfew recently.

597
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,800
We are closing.

598
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:27,690
You Highness.

599
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,330
Lord Liu asked you to go back quickly.

600
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,000
They bought charcoal to melt silver.

601
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:03,360
Who would have thought that it's hidden in a pleasure boat on the inner lake?

602
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,230
It's dark under the lamp.

603
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:09,520
They are really bold.

604
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:11,730
My lord, you really deserve your reputation.

605
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,540
The water ghost robbery case is now solved.

606
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:15,810
Who said it's solved?

607
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,200
Detective Liu.

608
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,670
Pass down my order.

609
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,980
Quickly gather some men. We'll make the arrest tonight.

610
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:27,970
Yes, my lord.

611
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,290
Uncle.

612
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,390
How is it?

613
00:40:57,110 --> 00:40:57,670
We've found it.

614
00:40:58,050 --> 00:40:59,890
It's hidden in a pleasure boat on the lake.

615
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:00,620
Has everything been deployed?

616
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,180
We're just waiting for your order.

617
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,100
Okay.

618
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,320
Mr. Mo,

619
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:05,760
please wait for her a little longer.

620
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:06,890
For what?

621
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,460
Do you think those losers from the Nandu Government Office could have thought of this?

622
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,390
Don't get overly nervous about everything.

623
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,060
Don't forget

624
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,850
these losers were exactly the ones

625
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:15,230
who risked being dismissed from office

626
00:41:15,410 --> 00:41:16,570
and lifted the Market Closure Order.

627
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:18,710
In my opinion,

628
00:41:19,260 --> 00:41:20,920
even if Miss Shu brings back the information,

629
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,130
it's not necessarily…

630
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:22,960
Things have changed.

631
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,030
Just as you've guessed,

632
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,570
people from the government are also shadowing them.

633
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:30,180
And they've been following the fleet

634
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:31,180
all the way to the dock.

635
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,140
While it's still dark,

636
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,900
take control of the pleasure boat before those losers do.

637
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,770
The 100,000 taels of silver was originally mine.

638
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:42,960
Wait a second.

639
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,140
It would be fine if it's just an ordinary official.

640
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,280
The one who came is the Detective of Jiangnan,

641
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:48,680
Liu Gongquan.

642
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:01,620
Lord Liu.

643
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,220
The robbers are now drifting on the lake.

644
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:09,550
We've also set up an ambush.

645
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,560
But those who stalk the robbers seem to be aware of us.

646
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,540
They probably won't come tonight.

647
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,080
It's weird.

648
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:18,740
Apparently, Young Master Xiang and Mo Bufan

649
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,300
are also aiming for the pleasure boat.

650
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,940
But at the critical moment, they withdrew in a hurry.

651
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:24,880
That's not strange.

652
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,940
When I first arrived at the lake,

653
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,450
I noticed that a master-hand has been tailing us.

654
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,640
Uncle, why didn't you capture that person then?

655
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,260
In war, one should make a move when it's advantageous.

656
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:38,060
If I'm not fully confident and it would alert the enemy,

657
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:39,120
of course we shouldn't make the move.

658
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,930
I think the person who tailed us must be someone under Young Master Xiang.

659
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,410
That's good too,

660
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,200
at least we can capture the fanatics all at one stroke.

661
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:49,260
As long as we catch them red-handed,

662
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,400
the case can be closed.

663
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:53,160
Can it be closed?

664
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,210
Who is it? Watch your step!

665
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:15,660
We've expropriated the boat here.

666
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,720
Don't let the spy escape.

667
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:53,660
Let's go.
