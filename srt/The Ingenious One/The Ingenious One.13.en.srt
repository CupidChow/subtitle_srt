4
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,960
This is not a place to stay.

5
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:55,990
Don't bother

6
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:57,000
going to look for more puffer fish.

7
00:01:58,520 --> 00:01:59,270
It's easy to catch them.

8
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,390
It's just that no one other than you

9
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,930
dares to cut them open.

10
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:04,870
You have to prepare them yourself.

11
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:07,940
We are all looking forward to your recovery.

12
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:10,750
With you around, the Cao Sect won't fall apart.

13
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,010
That physician told me that in the long run,

14
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,540
healing yourself with the weaker poison of pufferfish

15
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:21,140
will be fighting poison with poison.

16
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,090
You will become impervious to poison.

17
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:25,540
That is why over the years,

18
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,420
I've been fighting head-on.

19
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:30,590
I'd never thought about taking it slow.

20
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,020
Everyone in the Cao Sect comes from poverty.

21
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,030
We need someone tough, like you, to lead us.

22
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:38,040
By the way,

23
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,200
one of our men came back this morning

24
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,260
saying that Tang Xiao has been looking for you all over the city.

25
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,980
All these years,

26
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,620
how much have you done for him?

27
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,470
How much money have you earned for him?

28
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,060
He didn't show any mercy when things happened.

29
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,030
It's precisely because I've done a lot

30
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,070
and I know a lot

31
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,210
that he's the most worried

32
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,930
about me being alive.

33
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,510
What do you mean?

34
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,060
Are you resorting to underhanded tactics

35
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,210
because beating and torturing me was useless?

36
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,420
I will never testify against the Sect Leader.

37
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,110
Even if you threaten me with my life,

38
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,470
I will still say robbing and killing the traveling merchants

39
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:28,760
was my idea alone.

40
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,000
Xie Guang.

The raw silk has entered the city

42
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,290
and Qi Tianfeng has been defeated.

43
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,550
Qi Tianfeng is ruthless.

44
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,900
Why are you all so loyal to him?

45
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:41,480
Is human life

46
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:45,410
worth nothing in your eyes?

47
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,640
Shut up and kill me!

48
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,200
You don't even care about your own life.

49
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,780
I can't sleep at night.

50
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,780
As soon as I close my eyes, I can...

51
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:10,510
Coward!

52
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:18,630
Yes.

53
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,990
How will you find the answer here?

54
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,780
Why haven't you been eating well

55
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:47,600
and taking care of yourself these days?

56
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:54,659
You never came when I invited you to.

57
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:58,920
My sister must have called for you this time.

58
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:01,790
Don't worry about me.

59
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,160
I'm fine.

60
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,700
You don't have to pretend around me.

61
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,590
I happened to run into your maid.

62
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,600
She said she had finished sewing your clothes

63
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,350
and was bringing them to you.

64
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:36,010
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,330
I couldn't wash the blood off,

66
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,950
and I accidentally ripped it.

67
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,690
I have been fighting to uphold righteousness

68
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,260
and I've traversed the martial world.

69
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:52,060
But once I see blood,

70
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:57,800
I became like this again.

71
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,810
You are kind and righteous.

72
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,670
You see people as people.

73
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,190
This is what I know about you.

74
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:19,180
If you could sleep well the moment you came back,

75
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,150
I would feel a little scared.

76
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:24,480
It's okay.

77
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,220
This robe is damaged.

78
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,800
How about I make you a new one?

79
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,360
No.

80
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,400
This is a token of our love.

81
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,540
It has to accompany me until I grow old.

82
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:51,460
Then I'll embroider over where it was ripped.

83
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,710
As for the bloodstain,

84
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:55,710
I'll dye it black.

85
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,970
You will definitely look good

86
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,530
when you wear it.

87
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,780
There's a dyeing workshop at home.

88
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,170
Let's go now.

89
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,340
My lady, are you relieved now?

90
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,190
Have you talked to the workshop?

91
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,130
Although we don’t have much time to make the tributary cloth,

92
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:24,480
the craftsmanship mustn’t be careless.

93
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,460
Don't worry.

94
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,560
You don't need to remind me of this.

95
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:32,130
Are you tired of me nagging too much?

96
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:33,890
I dare not.

97
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,980
I just meant you've been tiring yourself out over these things.

98
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,680
Don't worry about them anymore.

99
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,860
But there's another thing

100
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,820
I need you to do.

101
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,340
It won't be easy.

102
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:51,770
Can you go to the Music Office

103
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,110
and see if you can help get Ms. Ke's name off their register?

104
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,820
Are you serious about this?

105
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,580
What's wrong?

106
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,100
Ms. Ke is smart.

107
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,790
Although she's of lowly status,

108
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,570
she's a gracious person.

109
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,850
What's wrong with that?

110
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,080
Nothing.

111
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,460
It's a great thing.

112
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:18,670
I'm just a little surprised.

113
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:21,810
At me?

114
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,160
Yes.

115
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,700
It's your fault.

116
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,610
My fault?

117
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,220
It's your fault for being too beautiful.

118
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,450
Why do I feel I've heard that before?

119

Don't seek your own doom.

130

The Cao Sect

131

The Cao Sect has been defeated.

133
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,590
It was completely and utterly defeated

134

If you want revenge, come for me.

Taking a defenseless woman hostage

137
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,570
isn't the Cao Sect's style.

How about I concede three more moves to you?

144

Watch who it is you're touching.

145

Cut off my head

150
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,620
and let my blood splatter on your face.

151

It's piping hot.

152
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,630
You'll be fine after getting wet.

153
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,880
I've killed people before.

154
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:02,820
Mingyu!

155
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,180
Don't listen to him. Put the knife down.

156
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:09,820
Kill me!

157
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,580
You'll recover if you kill me.

158
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,810
Do it!

159
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,420
Mingyu, don't listen to him. Put down the knife.

160
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,700
Come on.

161
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,410
If you had hurt her just now...

162
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,120
Leave.

163
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:40,820
I'm not the one

who should be repaying your debt.

165
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,800
Coward.

166
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,370
You're just a coward.

167
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:54,990
It's okay.

168
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,420
This is my choice.

169

[Zhang’s Pharmacy]

172
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,460
Young Master,

173
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,860
this medicine is supposed to act as an aide.

174
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,700
You must avoid spicy and oily foods.

175
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,570
Don't break the rules before you recover.

176
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,620
You broke the rule?

177
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:23,340
Willingly so.

Young Master,

180

Take care.

181

Count carefully.

182

Don't panic, got it?

183
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,160
Hurry up.

184
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,420
You're always so slow.

185
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,270

Aren't you in a hurry to go home?

187
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:48,270
Close the door.

188
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,820
Look at you.

189
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:51,300
I have something important to do today.

190
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,310
-Wait.
-Can you work carefully?

191
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,780
Hurry up.

192
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,180
You look so energetic, Mr. Mo. You look good.

193
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,010
Why are you here?

194
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,360
I was going to go look for you.

195
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,270
I brought some herbs that are rare on the market.

196
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:07,160
They can stabilize and supplement your essence, and are good for relaxing your muscles.

197
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:09,100
Tell Kang Qiao to avoid oily and spicy foods

198
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,370
while taking them.

199
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,970
Do you want something from me?

200
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:19,390
Mr. Mo,

201
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,390
you said you had something important to tell me.

202
00:14:21,410 --> 00:14:21,930
What is it?

203
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,650
Didn't Master tell us

204
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,380
to report to him once things are settled?

205
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:27,620
You disobeyed the order and let the Su family go.

206
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,100
Let’s go and explain as soon as possible.

207
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,600
You can still pretend to be sincere and frightened.

208
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:31,680
If you drag it out,

209
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,980
it will be hard for you to put on an act.

210
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,620
Not tonight.

211
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,860
Qi Tianfeng hasn't been apprehended yet.

212
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:37,980
This matter is not over yet.

213
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,880
Didn't I tell you

214
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,120
where he's hiding?

215
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,340
I'm short-handed.

216
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,500
Don't come to me for this.

217
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,450
Kang Qiao hasn't fully recovered.

218
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:49,830
We lost quite a few shadowmen too.

219
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:50,900
I don't have anyone for you.

220
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,690
You said

221
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,100
we can work together in the future.

222
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,160
You changed your mind?

223
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,940
Mr. Mo, you're not that kind of person, right?

224
00:14:59,310 --> 00:14:59,810
Besides,

225
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:01,520
I only want to borrow your shadowmen

226
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,100
to appear more intimidating.

227
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:05,230
To subdue those stragglers,

228
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,460
we'll still need your eloquence.

229
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:11,900
I have to go too?

230
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,570
Of course.

231
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,180
Qi Tianfeng killed Mr. Wen.

232
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,620
He is the Yuntai Sect's enemy.

233
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:18,100
Subduing him

234
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,130
will be a greatly meritorious act.

235
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:21,850
How would I dare monopolize something like that?

236
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,260
Gui.

237
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,170
Any news?

238
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,460
The ship has moored at the fishing port in the east.

239
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:57,020
Really?

240
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,420
But there's at least ten li to go.

241
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,860
Why isn't it at a dock nearby?

242
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:01,980
It's a long story.

243
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,580
But they have promised

244
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,590
to send someone to help us.

245
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,340
We need to get ready to set out as soon as possible.

246
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,580
Master.

247
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,420
Since the pirates' fleet entered the river a few days ago,

248
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,620
the River Defense Office has stepped up its patrols.

249
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,330
Master Guan didn't want to take the risk,

250
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,820
so he moored the ship at the fishing port in the east.

251
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,680
He didn’t want to take the risk?

252
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,860
Wasn’t he the one who entered the river

253
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,100
to transport raw silk into Nandu?

254
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,300
He didn't deny this.

255
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,040
But he asked me to tell you

256
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,570
that he only transported the silk for money.

257
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:30,550
Now, he is desperate for talented aides

258
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,770
and needs someone like you,

259
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,820
who knows the riverways well, urgently.

260
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,250
Okay, you may leave.

261
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
We'll be on standby.

262
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,030
Master.

263
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,960
I have an internal injury at a time like this.

264
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,190
Is the Cao Sect fated to be destroyed?

265
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:59,080
The men guarding outside are skilled.

266
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,060
With Master Guan's help,

267
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,260
we can definitely get out of here.

268
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,460
I think there are only 15 people in the yard.

269
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:13,740
We were careless just now

270
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:14,530
and exposed ourselves.

271
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,220
They are already on guard.

272
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,319
What a good time for you to be careless.

273
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:20,900
How can we launch a sneak attack?

274
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:21,490
It doesn't matter.

275
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,520
We have twice as many men as they do.

276
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,030
Even if we attack by force, we'll still win.

277
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,560
Yes.

278
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,140
Even a wall can't stop us.

279
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:28,870
Even so,

280
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,900
when we guarded the relay station,

281
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,920
we were also heavily outnumbered.

282
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,980
There's only one wall,

283
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:34,100
so it might not be appropriate to force our way in.

284
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,700
Yun Xiang promised

285
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,120
we will take Qi Tianfeng down without bloodshed.

286
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,620
Let's just stand guard here first.

287
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,210
It's boring to wait.

288
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,300
Let's give him a hard time

289
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,430
by announcing our presence.

290
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:49,370
Good.

291
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,500
-Okay.
-Let’s go.

292
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,700
How many shadowmen have you brought?

293
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,980
You're rich

294
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,700
and you have strong men and sturdy horses at your disposal.

295
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:12,930
I'm envious.

296
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:13,680
Come on.

297
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,220
Let me ask you.

298
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,850
How did you know

299
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:17,980
I can contact the pirates?

300
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,380
You said it yourself after meeting Master last time.

301
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,680
You once hired hundreds of pirate ships

302
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,440
to rescue victims in Anqing Prefecture.

303
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,620
That’s when you set your eyes on me?

304
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,320
Of course.

305
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,380
Okay.

306
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,240
In the future, I'll be careful

307
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,310
when I'm talking to you.

308
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,460
What are you up to now?

309
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,220
Qi Tianfeng's hideout

310
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:48,820
is near a smuggling port.

311
00:18:49,810 --> 00:18:50,300
Yes.

312
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:54,020
Smugglers collude with pirates too, right?

313
00:18:56,020 --> 00:18:57,300
No matter how badly injured he is,

314
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,230
he can still escape by boat.

315
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:01,730
But he chose to stay

316
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,180
somewhere near Nandu City

317
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,520
to wait for backup.

318
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,980
Maybe we were careless.

319
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:09,980
There might be unforeseen circumstances today.

320
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,640
Full speed!

321
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,780
Boss, someone is coming.

322
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,260
Old dog!

323
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,640
You don't even dare to show your face.

324
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,680
You call yourself the Iron Hand Demon?

325
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,650
Come out and fight us!

326
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,060
That's right! Come out!

327
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,260
Come out!

328
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,770
Come out!

329
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:43,310
Are you hungry after hiding for such a long time,

330
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,250
so you roasted your own balls for food?

331
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,150
No wonder you're all cowards.

332
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,890
I'll kill them all!

333
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,410
Ba.

334
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:53,700
Don't go out.

335
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,220
Don't fall into their trap.

336
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,940
Even if I die,

337
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,550
I can't let Master suffer this kind of humiliation.

338
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,830
Master ordered us to stand guard in the courtyard.

339
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,540
Brothers.

340
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,180
Calm down.

341
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,330
If they knew we had reinforcements,

342
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,080
they would have attacked us.

343
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:13,890
It's not too late to take revenge

344
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,130
after Master Guan comes.

345
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,780
They're Yun Xiang's reinforcements.

346
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:37,570
That's a sea bugle.

347
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,900
They should be pirates.

348
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,020
Pirates?

349
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,970
Will we come back from this alive

350
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:44,880
to get paid?

351
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:53,740
Brothers.

352
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,830
I'm afraid we've run into pirates.

353
00:21:56,430 --> 00:21:57,790
If we try to escape, we'll die for sure.

354
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,830
Kill them with me!

355
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:06,860
Kill them! Kill them!

356
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,330
Don't panic. I'll check it out first.

357
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:30,140
How dare you draw your swords when I, Guan, am here?

358
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,480
[Pirate, Master Guan]

359
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,050
Everyone,

360
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,830
we're here to settle a score.

361
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:37,370
We won't get in your way.

362
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,790
I am a man of the sea.

363
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,490
I don't understand your nonsense.

364
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:53,220
When the people of the sea come ashore,

365
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,730
you must follow the rules of the land.

366
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,260
Master, it's Master Guan.

367
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,530
Since he's here, we should meet.

368
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:11,570
Open the door.

369
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,620
Master Guan, how have you been?

370
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,640
I'm good, of course.

371
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,820
How did you end up like this?

372
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:45,700
I made a miscalculation.

373
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,010
I'm afraid I'll have to rely on you in the future.

374
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,430
No problem.

375
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,020
Let's fight into the courtyard

376
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,160
before making any further plans.

377
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:55,780
Master Guan.

378
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,600
Which of the Masters of the Three Oceans and Seven Islands

379
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:35,250
do you know, Lass?

380
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,500
Master Liu of Baisha Island.

381
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,500
Five years ago, I traveled across the East Sea

382
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,900
and saved his ship.

383
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,860
Since it's a blood debt,

384
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,930
you may live today.

385
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,300
According to the rules,

386
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,950
I have the final say

387
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:52,620
on how this blood debt is to be repaid.

388
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,770
You have a temper.

389
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,060
Tell me then.

390
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:00,930
Master.

391
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,400
Should we start fighting? If this goes on—

392
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,970
Leave Qi Tianfeng to me

393
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:11,260
and let us go.

394
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,780
Are you kidding me?

395
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,420
This is the rule of the sea.

396
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,780
If you refuse to repay a blood debt, you will suffer a shipwreck.

397
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,960
That’s right.

398
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:25,700
But I have already killed Master Liu.

399
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,140
It's no one's debt now.

400
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,270
Do I need to pay you back?

401
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,780
If you don't follow the rules of the sea,

402
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,740
then follow the rules of the martial arts world.

403
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:44,980
Stop!

404
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,090
Ms. Shu.

405
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,620
Don't be rude to Master Guan.

406
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,180
Mo!

407
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,420
Guan.

408
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,530
Why are you here?

409
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:04,020
-That Lass…
-Master, it's not looking good.

410
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,450
Let's retreat.

411
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:10,350
How have you been?

412
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,140
Master Qi.

413
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,180
We meet again.

414
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,460
Brothers!

415
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,060
Withdraw!

416
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:58,880
Master Guan!

417
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:02,060
You're not a man who goes back on your word.

418
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:03,330
Ridiculous!

419
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:05,220
When have I ever had a good reputation?

420
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,280
Qi Tianfeng.

421
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:15,790
Let's settle our score

422
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,320
once and for all.

423
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,580
If you break your meridians and destroy your internal force,

424
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:22,640
I guarantee your brothers won't be hurt.

425
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,690
The worst is death.

426
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,860
How can we let Master suffer humiliation?

427
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,580
You are willing to die for him,

428
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,830
but your Master is a righteous man.

429
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,010
He might not be willing to let you do that.

430
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:44,470
Yun Xiang.

431
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,270
Don't go too far.

432
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,150
Master Qi,

433
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:07,100
you came to Guanghui Bank to give me pointers.

434
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,020
You must have expended a great deal of energy.

435
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:11,860
What? Do you want to have another duel today?

436
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,060
Mo Bufan.

437
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,530
You're a lackey to an evildoer.

438
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,470
You'll have it coming to you!

439
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,900
Yun Xiang.

440
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,220
Are you willing to protect my brothers in the Cao Sect?

441
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,810
You still care for your brothers at this juncture?

442
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,140
Okay, I promise you.

443
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:00,470
I believe you.

444
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:15,420
-Don’t, Master.
-Go away!

445
00:29:50,370 --> 00:29:51,250
-Master!
-Master!

446
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:52,140
Master!

447
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:25,740
Guan.

448
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,500
Not bad.

449
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,650
You have all of the Three Oceans and Seven Islands under your command.

450
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,020
Even Wang Wufeng hadn't managed to do that

451
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:33,980
at his peak.

452
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,220
You're amazing.

453
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,690
Things have changed.

454
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,310
There aren't many in this business now.

455
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:40,470
Anyone who has a few lousy ships

456
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:43,260
and is brazen enough calls himself a Master.

457
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,490
What's the point of subduing them?

458
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,220
Master.

459
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,540
Master.

460
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,570
Here.

461
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,640
How are our men?

462
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,650
Don't worry. They're fine.

463
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,050
What did Mo Bufan give you

464
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,630
to make you turn against me at this juncture?

465
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,820
To be honest,

466
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,920
even if they hadn't shown up,

467
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,980
you wouldn't have gotten to live.

468
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,860
Why are you looking at me?

469
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,380
You have yourself to blame for messing with too many people.

470
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:32,060
Someone offered me a huge sum to silence you.

471
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,420
I wanted to lure you onto my ship first.

472
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,290
Who offered you money?

473
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,940
Who wants to silence you? Don't you know?

474
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:43,250
Do I have to say it here?

475
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,280
Tang Xiao, right?

476
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:56,570
Let's go.

477
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,780
We have nothing to do with this place anymore.

478
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:02,760
Let's go.

479
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,620
Lean on me.

480
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,050
Who is that young man?

481
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:27,020
Yun Xiang, what's wrong?

482
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,660
This guy is interesting.

483
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:30,140
I have been to Nandu twice.

484
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,850
I hear people talking about him everywhere.

485
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:35,390
I am in need of a smart subordinate.

486
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,930
Why don't you talk to him for me?

487
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,800
Guan, forget it.

488
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:42,420
He's not easy to deal with.

489
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:43,570
Don't have designs on him.

490
00:32:43,790 --> 00:32:44,200
Fine.

491
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,210
You made me come here for nothing.

492
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,450
How will you compensate me?

493
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,640
I'll prepare a big gift for you.

494
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:50,640
Okay.

495
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,460
I'll be off now.

496
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:53,790
Let me see you off.

497
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:56,710
Have some water.

498
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,120
So you've been following Tang Xiao's orders?

499
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:05,730
Ding Yi.

500
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,220
-Master.
-Leave us.

501
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:08,940
Master.

502
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:09,870
Go.

503
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:19,250
Yun Xiang.

504
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:22,220
You want to investigate the massacre in Luo Family's village?

505
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:25,100
Let me ask you first.

506
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,870
How deep will you look?

507
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:31,920
Anyone who was involved must pay the price.

508
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:37,160
Good.

509
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,380
Very good.

510
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,200
I've been

511
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,610
in a risky trade all my life.

512
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,860
At times, I have done unrighteous acts.

513
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,660
But to be honest,

514
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,860
it wasn't just to make money.

515
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,960
I also want to see those arrogant

516
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:04,920
and prestigious families

517
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:06,360
fall from grace

518
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,350
and experience how the rest of the world lives.

519
00:34:08,739 --> 00:34:10,679
So you wanted to use me to deal with the Su family

520
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,920
to fulfill your wish?

521
00:34:13,389 --> 00:34:14,030
Yes.

522
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,170
You can keep investigating

523
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,380
the Luo Family's village case.

524
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,500
But Nandu CIty

525
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:25,190
will be ruined by you first.

526
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:37,760
Qi Tianfeng.

527
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,350
You've said many useless things.

528
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,270
Why don't you explain what happened to my family first?

529
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:44,900
Okay.

530
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,900
I've already talked about your family's armed escort agency.

531
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,420
At this point,

532
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:52,820
you're still pinning it on Wen Cong?

533
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,430
You used to call him Godfather,

534
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,580
but now you call him by his name.

535
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,580
That means what I said just now...

536
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,610
Y- You believed me.

537
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,620
Ms. Shu.

538
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,680
Wen Cong destroyed the armed escort agency back then.

539
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,420
But now,

540
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,460
Yun Xiang has provoked

541
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,630
the bet between the Su family and me.

542
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:21,210
Aren't the tactics similar?

543
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,560
Think about it.

544
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:27,300
Of course,

545
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:31,220
I did all these.

546
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,570
If you kill me now,

547
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:37,290
that's right too.

548
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,180
Keep talking about Luo Family's village.

549
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,300
What was the relationship between the massacre and Tang Xiao?

550
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,900
It was a complicated relationship.

551
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,010
What about Wen Cong's imprisonment?

552
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,510
He moved it along.

553
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,980
Tang Xiao is a tyrant in Nandu City,

554
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,020
but he's just a puppet.

555
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,690
Who is behind him?

556
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:09,030
I've been investigating this for years.

557
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,290
But I'm not sure what is true.

558
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,510
Go on.

559
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:19,130
Tang Xiao laundered his dirty money using the gambling house

560
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:22,540
and then transported the money north of the Yangtze River.

561
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,040
Since he wants to cross the river,

562
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,100
he must use the Cao Sect's ships.

563
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,500
One of my trusted subordinates

564
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,320
accidentally heard their secret.

565
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,390
The Lingyuan Sect.

566
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,490
Do you have any evidence?

567
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:05,390
Where is the henchman you mentioned?

568
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,660
He was ordered to rob the traveling merchants

569
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:09,620
and never returned.

570
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,220
Since you have no evidence,

571
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,400
keep talking about Luo Family's village.

572
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,130
What did Wen Cong tell you?

573
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:21,980
He said he just wanted to buy the land.

574
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,360
What happened after that

575
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,340
was totally beyond his expectations.

576
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,810
He wasn't lying.

577
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,000
What happened after that?

578
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,820
What did you do after that?

579
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,900
What did Tang Xiao do?

580
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,410
It was a common way of acquiring land.

581
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:40,180
They bribed the soldiers and threatened the villagers.

582
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:42,850
But I don't usually deal with the government

583
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:44,490
and nor do I have such connections.

584
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,560
So Tang Xiao came to me and said

585
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:49,830
he had a deep relationship with the Government Office

586
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,820
and offered to mediate.

587
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:52,860
In other words,

588
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:58,190
you didn't know a single thing

589
00:37:58,810 --> 00:38:00,150
about the massacre of the village?

590
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,810
I heard about it.

591
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:08,040
I heard about it before the incident.

592
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,840
But I didn't pay attention to it,

593
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,200
and I didn't tell Wen Cong.

594
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,330
Those were 313 lives.

595
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,980
How could you ignore them?

596
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:34,810
Yun Xiang.

597
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,660
I was an itinerant

598
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,150
who couldn't even guarantee my own survival.

599
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:42,420
How could I offend Tang Xiao

600
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:43,340
for the sake of people I hadn't even met,

601
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,660
much less offend

602
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,320
those soldiers who killed so many people?

603
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,300
That's all I have to say.

604
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,980
I've told you everything I know.

605
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:04,010
If you follow this lead,

606
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,820
you will find out the truth

607
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,350
about the massacre of Luo Family’s village.

608
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,700
If you manage to catch Tang Xiao,

609
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:16,340
you can gorge out my eyes

610
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,180
so that I can see

611
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,020
him being destroyed.

612
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,340
I've said everything I need to say.

613
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,420
Please keep your promise

614
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,950
and don't hurt my men.

615
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,940
Let them go.

616
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:09,780
It's time to end this.

617
00:40:11,730 --> 00:40:12,290
Ms. Shu.

618
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:16,980
Go ahead.
