Greetings, Master. I'm disciple Mo Bufan.

00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:01,790
Mo Bufan.

00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,690
Do you think I can't see you?

7
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,240
Master, your are extremely skillful.

8
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,810
I admire you immensely.

9
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,440
Do you know

10
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,620
why I summoned you here alone?

11
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,140
It's because of Yun Xiang?

12
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,340
He declared

13
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:17,460
to make the No.1 gambling house in Jiangnan.

14
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:19,810
On this ridiculous matter,

15
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,260
do you have any knowledge of the inside information?

16
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:28,240
It began with Qi Tianfeng admitting that

17
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,220
Tang Xiao assassinated Wen Cong.

18
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,380
Since Yun Xiang has taken over

19
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,450
the post of Nandu General Governor,

20
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,060
of course he'd want to put an end to the bygones.

21
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,420
This is also for the sake of irritating Tang Xiao

22
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,710
so that he would bite the hook himself.

23
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,100
As long as he defeats Tang Xiao,

24
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,900
he could take the throne in gambling

25
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,620

28
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,240
I was worried that the sect was not big enough for the two of you.

And he wouldn't let us redeem him.

93
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:09,080
Now he's sent the kid to the ancestral house in Yin County.

94

95

Why do you seem a bit sweaty today?

123
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,460
I kept a promise. I still need to get used to it.

the topic we'll be talking about

129
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,590
is going to be a bit awkward.

130

But if you have anything to say,

131
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,510

If I say I had no feelings about it,

135
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:00,020
that would be a lie.

You are really sincere, I would say.

147
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,820

148
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,260
if I have ulterior motives,

149

I can't hide it from you.

150
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,299
It's better to be frank.

151
00:08:43,549 --> 00:08:45,830
This way, maybe we can get rid of our grudges.

152
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:50,750
It's not a bad idea to be sincere.

153

00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,070
Come on. Take her away.

187
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:35,300
Is this the one who ran away and got caught three times in three days

188
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,840
and hung herself after she got back?

189
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,440
My lord.

190
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,410
You simply like other men's women.

191
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:45,010
Well, I really do.

192
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:47,250
My lord.

193
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,460
The spy reported that

194
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:51,190
Yun Xiang's next target is you.

195
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,360
He wants to be the head of gambling in Nandu.

196
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,100
How about I get rid of Yun Xiang?

197
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,060
I'm warning you. Don't try him.

198
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:03,700
Follow the plan and decrease his power first.

199
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:04,910
Also,

200
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:06,340
is Qi Tianfeng dead yet?

201
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,350
All his men are dead.

202
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,150
Who did that? We had the same plan.

203
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,830
But he himself is nowhere to be found.

204
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,770
Why does he have so many enemies?

205
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,620
Today's reeves shad is very fresh.

206
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,760
Here, have some more.

207
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,550
Sister.

208
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,620
I think Tang Xiao

209
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,110
might become the next Qi Tianfeng.

210
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,710
Tang Xiao has really been insolent and conceited these years.

211
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,490
He's been ignoring the rules of the Chamber of Commerce.

212
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,000
If someone could break his spirit,

213
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:44,160
it's a good thing for the Nandu Chamber of Commerce as well.

214
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,640
You don't have to say that, Sister.

215
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,590
Right now, Tang Xiao

216
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,680
is not our only trouble.

217
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,320
Yun Xiang is still the one who worries me the most.

218
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,050
The Tang family gives you six taels per month.

219
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:07,380
How about I give you eight taels?

220
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,080
Eight taels is a lot.

221
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,230
But I can't do Liansheng House's work.

222
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,800
Tell me the truth.

223
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:17,810
Why is that?

224
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:19,670
Tang Xiao told us before that

225
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:22,930
if anyone from the Tangs' Gambling House dares to work for Liansheng House,

226
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,540
he/she will be dead before their salary can be spent.

227
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,700
In my early years in Liansheng House,

228
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,220
you've taken good care of me, Miss Ke.

229
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,590
I'm really sorry.

230
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,670
I understand. I won't make things difficult for you.

231
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,220
Please leave.

232
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,150
Miss Ke, take care.

233
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,120
Miss.

234
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,620
If you ask me, they are all traitors.

235
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,080
Why do you want to give them a raise instead?

236
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:58,520
There are only few gambling houses in Nandu

237
00:13:58,540 --> 00:13:59,550
that are not under Tang Xiao's name.

238
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,780
They have no other choices.

239
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,870
How are things going with you?

240
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:08,000
The waiters and pages are easy to find.

241
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,210
They are almost fully recruited.

242
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,790
Go on. Don't slack off.

243
00:14:12,330 --> 00:14:13,350
Come help me when you're done.

244
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,100
Got it.

245
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,280
Little boy, come here.

246
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,740
Be careful, little boy.

247
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,180
Uncle, help us please.

248
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,820
My sister is almost beaten to death.

249
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,380
Where is she? Take me there.

250
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,410
Over there.

251
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,660
Hurry up.

252
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,070
She's right inside.

253
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:12,740
Stop!

254
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,120
What a coincidence.

255
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,330
We meet again.

256
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,910
You two really put in a lot of effort into this despicable scheme

257
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:42,320
to get me here.

258
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,500
I've been wanting to practice my swordsmanship with you.

259
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:47,970
No time is better than today.

260
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:51,150
Great.

261
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,770
You are a master.

262
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,130
But only a half.

263
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,320
You want to die?

264
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,740
Let me.

265
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:49,260
Despicable you. Play the dirty tricks.

266
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,700
Still, you can't beat your senior Jin.

267
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:20,369
Miss.

268
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,390
Master saw how hard you've been working,

269
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,260
so he asked me to bring you a pot of jasmine tea.

270
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,470
Thank you. Please thank Master for me.

271
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,520
Next. Come in.

272
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,220
Miss, please.

273
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,430
This is not lime powder.

274
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,940
How much poison did she take?

275
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,570
Young Master, she took it all.

276
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,650
Take a closer look.

277
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,410
Who am I?

278
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,940
You are my master.

279
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,980
Your Heart Devouring Powder is really magical.

280
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:05,460
It's worth it. So many beauties died for it.

281
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,380
This poison

282
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,740
has finally succeeded.

283
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,150
Am I right, Tianhu?

284
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:11,900
With the Heart Devouring Powder,

285
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,690
you don’t need to worry if Miss Ke doesn't obey.

286
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:15,960
That's the woman I love.

287
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,870
Watch your mouth.

288
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,220
Besides,

289
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,480
the poison's effect is still unstable.

290
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:24,630
Who's going to pay for it if I poison her to death?

291
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,130
Ke Menglan, that bitch.

292
00:19:27,970 --> 00:19:30,850
I'll make her submit to me with her whole body and heart sooner or later.

293
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,870
There'll be no need for poison.

294
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,480
Come on.

295
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:35,870
Tianhu.

296
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,250
Do you know

297
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,500
who the "bitch" I was talking about is?

298
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,860
It's my sister.

299
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,380
Is your sister

300
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,060
a bitch?

301
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,920
If Master says so, no doubt she is.

302
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:53,740
Is everyone here?

303
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,200
Sorry to keep you waiting.

304
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,430
Come with me.

305
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,220
Aren't we going to see Mr. Ke?

306
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,500
It's the same talking to me.

307
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:01,580
Come with me.

308
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,130
According to rough estimation,

309
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,640
2,500 taels.

310
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,020
It's really not enough.

311
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,140
Why didn't you knock?

312
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,130
You're getting more and more unruly.

313
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:48,650
Long time no see.

314
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,430
How many times have you missed me?

315
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,700
Mr. Tang.

316
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:57,810
What are you looking at?

317
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:01,020
Do you prefer there's someone out there

318
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:02,460
or not?

319
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,600
In broad daylight,

320
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,160
this is not the Tangs' Gambling House.

321
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,000
Please behave yourself, Mr. Tang.

322
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,220
You really don't know me.

323
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,670
In my whole life,

324
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,190
what I love the most is someone else's house,

325
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,340
and someone else's woman.

326
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,420
Forget it. I won't tease you today.

327
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:27,430
I came here

328
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,690
to discuss something serious with you.

329
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,320
Here, let me show you something.

330
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,240
Open it.

331
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:49,710
[Elevation Certificate]

332
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:56,910
It really took me a lot of effort

333
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,430
to get your elevation certificate

334
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:00,980
from the Music Office.

335
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,430
Take this to any government office,

336
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,000
and you'll be elevated out of lowly status.

337
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,590
Beauty.

338
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,660
You must be careful.

339
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,110
This is the only copy.

340
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,080
If there is any damage,

341
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:22,710
there will be no turning back.

342
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:29,250
Tell me.

343
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,350
There are so many men in the world

344
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,380
who admire you,

345
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:38,550
saying they'd steal the moon and stars for you.

346
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,530
How many of them can be like me,

347
00:22:40,970 --> 00:22:44,510
knowing what you really want?

348
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,780
Why don't you tell me frankly, Mr. Tang?

349
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:02,180
What do you want me to exchange it for?

350
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,020
After the renovation,

351
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,450
our Liansheng House is indeed more magnificent.

352
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:09,820
It'll be more beautiful when the red lanterns are lit

353
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,340
when it gets dark.

354
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,360
Right.

355
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,070
Tianhu.

356
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:24,540
What's the matter, Miss?

357
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,640
Are you a little tired?

358
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,660
A little.

359
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,020
I went to see you at the box between 3 p.m. and 5 p.m.

360
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,540
Where did you go?

361
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,490
You are tricking me again, Miss.

362
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,870
I've been in the box the whole time.

363
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,400
Miss.

364
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,540
Xiaoyu.

365
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:58,850
Where's Ling'er?

366
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:03,090
She's sneaking food in the kitchen.

367
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,100
If you tell on her, you are not a good friend.

368
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,190
Be my spy

369
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,740
and help me win the bet of Young Master Xiang.

370
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:19,730
Mr. Yun never set a bet.

371
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,460
It's exactly Mr. Yun whose motive is exerable.

372
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:27,450
He asked you to make Liansheng House

373
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:30,620
better than the Tangs' Gambling House in every aspect.

374
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,620
My life-or-death bet with him

375
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:38,420
has started a long time ago.

376
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,240
But she's the one who's not obedient.

377
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,300
All right.

378
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:14,140
Xiaoyu, Ling'er. You can eat anything you want

379
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:15,550
in Liansheng House from now on.

380
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:16,320
Okay?

381
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:18,450
Are you hungry now?

382
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,220
Go.

383
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:22,830
Have some snacks with Tianhu in the kitchen.

384
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:24,760
Watch them.

385
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:25,750
Don't let them get burnt.

386
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:12,460
Mr. Yun.

387
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:18,670
You've worked hard, Manager Ke.

388
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,020
Have you recruited all the people we need?

389
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,180
The handymen and chefs are fully recruited.

390
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:27,550
We've hired seven head dealers. We still need some more.

391
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:30,600
I'll meet with the musicians tomorrow.

392
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,360
I'm sure I can pick some good ones.

393
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,620
I don't know how long I'd have to work

394
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,030
on these complicated matters

395
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,630
without you, Manager Ke.

396
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,220
I'm really tired.

397
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,050
If there's nothing else you need me for, Mr. Yun,

398
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,340
can I go back to my room to rest?

399
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:51,290
Sure.

400
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:09,760
As you expected,

401
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:11,190
Tang Xiao went to Shengxingyuan

402
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,650
and stayed there for two hours.

403
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:13,780
Did you alert him?

404
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:14,980
I didn't follow him in there.

405
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,700
So I don't know what he did.

406
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,390
Sometimes,

407
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:22,000
you don't have to hear or see with your own ears and eyes.

408
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,890
Menglan is not a betrayer.

409
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,510
After Godfather got in trouble,

410
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,480
she managed Liansheng House all by herself.

411
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,060
I never saw her being selfish.

412
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,620
Why did I ask you

413
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,230
to inquire about her whereabouts today?

414
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,450
Qian Rong sent a secret letter,

415
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:40,450
saying someone took away Menglan's elevation certificate

416
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,300
from the Music Office.

417
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,340
That's right.

418
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,980
Who do you think did it?

419
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:52,890
Yun Xiang.

420
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:55,360
No matter what Tang Xiao said to Menglan,

421
00:27:55,730 --> 00:27:56,710
I don't think she'll do anything bad.

422
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,620
How about I talk to her,

423
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,560
or let Su Mingyu talk to her?

424
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:08,190
Let me ask you this.

425
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,400
If you're in the dark right now,

426
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,360
what would you want the most?

427
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,240
To see light.

428
00:28:19,930 --> 00:28:20,330
That's right.

429
00:28:21,930 --> 00:28:22,630
To see light.

430
00:28:24,090 --> 00:28:25,550
Perhaps for Ke Menglan,

431
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,660
it's her lifelong wish

432
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,910
to be elevated out of lowly status.

433
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,350
It might be the light in her heart.

434
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,980
Now this opportunity is right in front of her.

435
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:42,620
So if she chose to side with Tang Xiao,

436
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:43,860
I wouldn't blame her.

437
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,090
But have you thought about it?

438
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,390
Once you make it clear,

439
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,550
it's like forcing her to

440
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,030
make a choice between friendship and freedom.

441
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:57,980
How cruel is that?

442
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:10,660
If we don't make it clear, we can make use of her

443
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,600
to deliver wrong news to Tang Xiao.

444
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,130
You want to use the same trick again?

445
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,550
If Menglan decided to help Tang Xiao,

446
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,840
how could she and Su Mingyu keep their relationship?

447
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,250
Have you ever thought

448
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,220
why Qian Rong gave the secret letter

449
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,220
to me first,

450
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,230
instead of asking Mingyu directly?

451
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:34,640
Think about it.

452
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,780
What would Su Mingyu do if he knew about this, given his temper?

453
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:39,500
If he forces Miss Menglan to make a choice,

454
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,850
what will Miss Menglan do?

455
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,270
Is it really the best choice

456
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,320
to tell Su Mingyu?

457
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,220
Did Tang Xiao

458
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,360
just force us into a dead end like this?

459
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,410
Of course not.

460
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,230
As long as I win this bet,

461
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,970
everything will be solved.

462
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:09,900
And I want to tell you that

463
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:11,860
I'll definitely win

464
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,040
this bet.

465
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,380
How much Drunken Dragon Powder did you use?

466
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,460
I used all that I brought.

467
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,040
How prodigal!

468
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,700
If you changed it to taels,

469
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,610
they could've smashed him to death.

470
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,180
Stop pretending.

471
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,900
The antidote should take effect immediately.

472
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:43,900
Get up.

473
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,010
Tell me.

474
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,830
What's Yun Xiang's plan?

475
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:57,960
Tell me all about it.

476
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,890
Yun Xiang is the one who wants to beat you.

477
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,340
Go get him.

478
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,220
What are you arresting me for?

479
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:04,130
Ten Taels of Gold.

480
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:05,560
I think

481
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,040
you are a sensible person.

482
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,010
So,

483
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,580
let's get straight to the point.

484
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,430
Have some of this.

485
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:21,160
You should have heard about me.

486
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,780
I'm a businessman.

487
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,860
I want to treat everyone equally.

488
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,900
So those who fall into my hands

489
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:28,930
won't end well.

490
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,410
You know that too.

491
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:31,970
So...

492
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,160
So, if you want to die a decent death,

493
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,550
let's make it quick.

494
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,140
Fine.

495
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,740
Is Qi Tianfeng at your place?

496
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:50,700
I don't know.

497
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,280
You don't know anything, right?

498
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,760
You're the man Yun Xiang trusts the most.

499
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:55,640
I'm flattered.

500
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:58,460
The men he trusts the most are Shu Yanan

501
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,130
and Su Mingyu.

502
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:03,070
I'm just a swordsman who goes by paycheck.

503
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,600
How much does he pay you,

504
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,790
killing people for him?

505
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:09,640
Ten taels for each person, for real?

506
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:10,630
Of course.

507
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:13,340
How about this? Come work for me.

508
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,750
I'll pay you more.

509
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:15,800
How much?

510
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,140
20 taels.

511
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:23,200
I won’t do it even if you give me 10000 taels.

512
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,180
Ten Taels of Gold!

513
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,780
If you want to die, I'll grant your wish.

514
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,770
I'll grant your wish.

515
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,650
If I become an evil spirit,

516
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,060
none of you

517
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,110
will make it out alive.

518
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,110
Take him down.

519
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:10,600
[Lingyuan Sect Ye Xiao]

520
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,170
Mr. Ye.

521
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,820
Recently, the gambling house has cleared another sum of money.

522
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:26,780
Although the Cao Sect is gone,

523
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,560
I will transfer the money to the north of Yangtze River

524
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,220
at all costs.

525
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,150
It's just that,

526
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,930
according to your order,

527
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,150
I've killed many people from Yuntai Sect.

528
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,860
If I really irritate them,

529
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:52,460
I'll need Lingyuan Sect's help.

530
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,590
Before the matter of Young Master Xiang is solved,

531
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:05,540
you don't need to transfer the money anymore.

532
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,250
In case someone follows you

533
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:10,120
and gets us involved.

534
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:17,360
You've done a great job all these years.

535
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,980
If you can defeat Yuntai Sect and make another contribution,

536
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,580
I won't mind you become a disciple of our sect.

537
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:27,550
This way, no matter what trouble you get into,

538
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:30,480
someone will have your back.

539
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,920
Thank you for your help, Mr. Ye.

540
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,810
Before that,

541
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,860
you'd better keep your identity a secret.

542
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:43,150
If you dare to tell anyone about Lingyuan Sect,

543
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,570
you'll suffer the consequences yourself.

544
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:50,900
I understand.

545
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:04,310
Since we don't miss each other every day, we miss each other now.

546
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,760
That's why I miss you.

547
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,680
I got to know that my Menglan was promoted to manager.

548
00:35:08,890 --> 00:35:09,930
I was more than happy to hear that.

549
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,500
But I also saw you working hard all day,

550
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,450
so I didn't dare to disturb you.

551
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,850
I could only prepare a few dishes

552
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:18,110
to express my love for you.

553
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:22,250
It's my fault for being stupid

554
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:25,150
and making my beloved suffer alone.

555
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:27,020
From now on,

556
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:29,080
I'll be with Menglan forever.

557
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,330
A heart for a heart.

558
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:38,590
[Mingyu]

559
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:15,700
[No regret once the move is made]
