I'm sure you'll like it.

7
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,620
I wondered why Mr. Yun

8
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:58,479
chose to play word guessing in the second round.

9
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,940
It turned out that he had made a perfect plan.

10
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,020
Indeed.

11
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:08,699
Yun adopted a risky way this time.

12
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,259
He had no choice.

13
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,970
He knows Tang Xiao got people inside Liansheng House.

14
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,390
Even if we use our own things,

15
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,090
it's hard to make sure nothing would go wrong.

Your little master is really capable.

But Yun Xiang saw that coming.

Therefore, he proposed to play word guessing.

71
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:31,970
In this way,

72
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:34,830
he can prevent you from cheating.

73
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,659
It's reasonable for him to see that coming.

74
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,610
But how could he cheat in word guessing?

75
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,670
With the help of iron filings and magnetic powder.

76
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,690
The inkstick was specially made.

77
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,330
There was magnetic powder in the compartment.

78
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,210
When Mr. Su opened it,

79
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,830
he could see the word

00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,120
That is a fresh approach.

But...

83
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:14,900
I remember you brought the paper, inkstick,

84
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,780
ink brush, and inkstone in person.

85
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,160
They were labeled "used in accounting office".

86
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,900
I only found out later that

87
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,880
in order to make sure nothing would go wrong,

88
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,090
Yun Xiang changed all the inkstones in Liansheng House.

89
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:28,700
Besides,

90
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,770
if you sent someone to buy one,

91
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,250
you would get the same result.

92
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,620
Yun Xiang swapped all the inkstones nearby for ones with iron filings.

93
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,440
That's impressive.

00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:09,450
Even if you don't have a close tie with Yun Xiang,

102
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,800
you shouldn't betray Ke Menglan.

103

She's not a traitor.

114
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:48,140
She lost her mind because I poisoned her with Heart Devouring Powder.

115
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,270
She has to obey my order even if I ask her to die.

You can't intimidate me with that.

119
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,550

00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,700
Don't let emotions cloud your judgment.

193
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,280
Don't worry.

194
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,900
I have a very thorough plan.

195
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,350
Trust me.

196
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:48,800
By the way,

197
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,020
you have to teach me

198
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,700
how to get down from here

199
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,180
without getting hurt.

200
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,240
Why don't you take the front door?

201
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,450
If others know

202
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:59,150
I leave Liansheng House alone,

203
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,280
it will undermine my plan.

204
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,020
I have to make sure nothing goes wrong.

205
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:05,080
How about this? Give me a demonstration.

206
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:06,380
I can imitate you.

207
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,600
I can do it.

208
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:13,510
Trust me.

209
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:15,490
Come on.

210
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,290
I didn't see anything.

211
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,800
Just jump. What are you waiting for?

212
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,840
Even if you fall to the ground, you just need to rest for a few days.

213
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,020
I believe in you.

214
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,370
Why are you standing so far away?

215
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,920
Catch me.

216
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,550
Don't even think about it.

217
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:06,460
I'm gonna jump.

218
00:15:38,010 --> 00:15:40,460
You have a small figure but you're strong.

219
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:53,570
The weather is dry. Beware of fire.

220
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,260
Miss, are you alright?

221
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:04,820
Good.

222
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:13,590
The weather is dry. Beware of fire.

223
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,140
All right, go back now.

224
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:17,620
I'm leaving.

225
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:19,930
Are you going to Guanghui Bank?

226
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:21,790
You're quite smart.

227
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,960
What? What do you mean?

228
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:27,110
Mr. Mo will definitely say something.

229
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,180
You'll know when you get there.

230
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,220
Oh,

231
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:31,570
about Jin.

232
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:33,450
I've sent shadowmen to keep an eye on him.

233
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,900
They are waiting for the right moment to rescue him.

234
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,710
You're quite strong.

235
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,660
Jin Biao is still in the dungeon of Tang's Residence.

236
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,690
In addition, Ke Menglan and Tianhu

237
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:53,700
entered Tang's Residence.

238
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,650
But Ke Menglan stopped outside the courtyard

239
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,260
while Tianhu went into Tang Xiao's room.

240
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:58,210
She was there for about an hour.

241
00:16:58,910 --> 00:16:59,900
Go back and keep watching.

242
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:00,900
Yes.

243
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,510
How many people in Liansheng House

244
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,490
can you trust now?

245
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,430
I knew about Miss Ke.

246
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:14,740
But I didn't expect Tianhu to be controlled by Tang Xiao as well.

247
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,630
Now the people who are running Liansheng House

248
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,900
are all Tang Xiao's people.

249
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:19,609
But you chose to compete with him.

250
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,450
What chance is there of you winning?

251
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,690
What's the point of winning all the time?

252
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,520
What if I want to lose?

253
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,050
I'm all ears.

254
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,350
It's boring to know the answer now.

255
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,060
Don't worry, Mr. Mo.

256
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,540
I can guarantee Guanghui Bank

257
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:40,020
to be the biggest beneficiary of this competition.

258
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,290
You seem pretty sure about it.

259
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:48,180
Actually, the betrayal of these people

260
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,820
is not important.

261
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,780
It's very likely you'll turn Tang Xiao's trick against him.

262
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:57,280
But if someone who's very close to you

263
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,710
turns against you,

264
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,860
you'll be doomed.

265
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,420
That girl was poisoned by Drunken Dragon.

266
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,090
But she said she had a secret medicine

267
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,000
that could delay the poison from taking effect.

268
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,110
That's how she escaped from the dungeon of Tang's Residence.

269
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,130
She is good at using poison.

270
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,370
Of course, she is good at detoxifying as well.

271
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,690
That's the poison from Lingyuan Sect.

272
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,420
You and I have long suspected Tang Xiao colludes with Lingyuan Sect.

273
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,170
It's not surprising that he uses the Dragon series poison well.

274
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,840
You're burying the lede.

275
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,490
You know I'm not talking about Tang Xiao.

276
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,620
Tell me the truth.

277
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,200
The first time I took you to see Master, we were tailed.

278
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,700
Kang Qiao got poisoned with Dragon series poison

279
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:45,060
in a fight with a mystery person.

280
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,030
Is that person her?

281
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,330
Why do you think it was Miss Shu?

282
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,010
It's just my hunch.

283
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:03,380
That's right.

284
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,670
Miss Shu has had a rough life.

285
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,730
She had many adventures while traveling.

286
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,220
When I first met her,

287
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:17,680
I knew she was proficient in the Dragon series poison.

288
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,260
I tried many times to test her out.

289
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,830
But I didn't see anything wrong.

290
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,600
Even if you don't believe her,

291
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,130
you should trust me.

292
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:29,430
I just want to remind you.

293
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,090
You don't have to explain so much.

294
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,730
But just now, when I asked

295
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,270
what if the person closest to you betrays you,

296
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,570
she's the one you thought of first,

297
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:42,250
right?

298
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,060
Last time, at Liansheng House,

299
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,120
you said there was something we couldn't talk about there.

300
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,010
What is it?

301
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,880
From now on, keep me informed

302
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:06,180
of everything Yun Xiang does.

303
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,360
I have so many things to tell you.

304
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,910
It's too late today.

305
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:15,370
I'm sleepy. I'm going to bed.

[Liansheng House]

307
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,770
Yun Xiang gave me three pouches.

308
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,100
One pouch a day. We need to act according to the plan inside.

309
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,060
Pouches?

310
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:39,430
What's wrong with Yun?

311
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,890
Why can't he arrange this himself?

312
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:42,200
I don't know.

313
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,180
He would stay in his room every day and wouldn't see anyone.

314
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:48,060
He asked me to send food and daily necessities to his room.

315
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:54,960
Why are you smiling?

316
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,360
I smiled because you're blinded by love.

317
00:20:59,070 --> 00:21:00,060
In the past,

318
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,880
you wouldn't do such a thing.

319
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,280
He's always playing tricks.

320
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,580
I don't want to ask about details.

321
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,840
That being said,

322
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:11,580
since I met Yun,

323
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,940
he has never failed.

324
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,730
I admire him very much.

325
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:17,860
It's natural that you like him.

326
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,640
Like him?

327
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,420
I know you've been working hard lately.

328
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,860
This is the second day since Liansheng House's opening.

-Everyone, pull yourselves together. -This is the most important thing now.

330
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,570
You're not only blinded by love.

331
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,720
Your soul is stolen by her.

10% rebate for promotion?

341
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,060
Mr. Su,

342
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,260
the highest rebate offered

343
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,190
by gambling houses in Nandu is 1%.

344
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,350
You can offer 10%?

345
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,620
You must have heard

00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,130
we are competing with Tang's Gambling House

347
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,410
on revenues.

348
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:29,810
So in order to attract more customers,

349
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,440
we decided to offer a 10% rebate,

00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,400
but only for three days.

351
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,140
Just three days?

352
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,960
Then we have to hurry up.

353
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,930
What are we waiting for?

00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,730

00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,780

Is he insulting me?

359
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,280
He wants to beat me

360
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,790
with a 10% rebate?

361
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,420
Maybe...

362
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,640
Maybe he has a backup plan?

363
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:58,130
Or maybe he's diverting our attention.

00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,050

00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:49,360
Menglan.

376
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:07,410
I lost seven to eight customers in an hour.

377
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:09,740
I know.

378
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:11,700
But there's nothing I can do.

379
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,270
There are a few dealers

380
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,220
who are planted here by Tang Xiao.

381
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:23,880
They made customers lose in a row

382
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,540
and drove them away in this way.

383
00:24:27,290 --> 00:24:27,830
Menglan.

384
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,660
You are experienced.

385
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:31,690
You can see what they are trying to do.

386
00:24:35,870 --> 00:24:37,550
But we are really short of hands now.

387
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:40,920
I don't have enough people to replace them.

388
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,160
What if we offer a higher rebate?

389
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,950
We'll lose money then.

390
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,800
Tang Xiao and Yun Xiang are competing on revenues.

391
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,880
It's not about net profit.

392
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,270
Why are you confused?

393
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:02,280
Help me.

394
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:04,850
Mr. Su and I know little

395
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,650
about running the gambling house.

396
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,430
I can only rely on you now.

397
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:10,920
I'm afraid Yun Xiang has underestimated his rival.

398
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,210
By convention,

399
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,150
the banker wins in a draw.

400
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,830
We can change the rule for these three days.

401
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,130
Players are considered winners in a draw.

402
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,120
This is more attractive to players

403
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,190
than the 10% rebate.

404
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,290
I knew you could find a way.

405
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,170
This is not a long-term solution.

406
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,030
As long as these dealers are here,

407
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,740
they'll continue to play tricks.

408
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:41,220
Leave it to me.

409
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,060
Thank you, Menglan.

410
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,690
I'm glad you're here.

411
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,930
I'll deal with them.

412
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:06,490
Everyone,

413
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,500
are you having a good time?

414
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,100
If you want more fun,

415
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,980
we can change the rules.

416
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,820
In these three days,

417
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:19,480
in a draw, players take all.

418
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,830
Great! Nice!

419
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,120
Someone just said

420
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,400
some of our dealers are cheating.

421
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,690
I want you to do me a favor.

422
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:31,660
Please tell me

423
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,550
if you find any dealer who's playing tricks.

424
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,830
You'll be rewarded with ten taels of gold.

425
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,860
Ten taels! Ten taels!

426
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,970
For a dealer, reputation is everything.

427
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:44,700
If you want to break the rules of Liansheng House,

428
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,000
you can have a try.

429
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,520
Sir, please come in.

430
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:10,770
Mr. Su, you are back.

431
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,140
It's after curfew now.

432
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,370
Why haven't we closed yet?

433
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,260
You don't know?

434
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,620
We just got permission

435
00:27:19,770 --> 00:27:21,240
to stay open overnight these three days.

436
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,740
Really? That's nice.

437
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:23,980
Go.

438
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,130
Mr. Qian was here this afternoon.

439
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:29,050
Chairman Su asked him to use connections in the government to make an exception for us,

440
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,760
allowing us to stay open overnight for three days.

441
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,960
My sister said she would prepare a gift for our opening ceremony.

442
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,180
I didn't expect it to be so unique.

443
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:37,670
This came in handy.

444
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,670
I'd like to thank the Su family on behalf of Yun Xiang.

445
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,270
Yun's concerns are my concerns.

446
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:44,990
You don't need to say thank you.

447
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,350
Have you found out how much

448
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:52,500
Tang's Gambling House has earned today?

449
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,260
Of course.

450
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,530
We should get Menglan.

451
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,700
She's good at calculating.

452
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,290
Up to today,

453
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,180
we have earned 1,328 taels and 7 cents.

454
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,340
-So little?
-That much?

455
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,220
How much has Tang's Gambling House earned?

456
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,260
Over 2,900 taels.

457
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,330
How did they do that?

458
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:25,020
Tang Xiao has more than ten gambling houses.

459
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,490
Customers of those gambling houses

460
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:28,670
got free chips today.

461
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,840
The chips can only be used in Tang's Gambling House.

462
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:35,430
In this way, more people went to Tang's Gambling House.

463
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,990
But even without the free chips,

464
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,810
the daily revenue of Tang's Gambling House

465
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,960
is about 1,000 taels.

466
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,680
Even if we stay open all night,

467
00:28:48,990 --> 00:28:49,810
at most, we can earn as much as they do.

468
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,980
Is there any other way?

469
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,980
We don't have to follow Tang Xiao's rules.

470
00:28:58,860 --> 00:28:59,860
What do you think?

471
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:01,150
The so-called revenue

472
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,720
is actually just a few pages of the ledger.

473
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,940
But the government stipulates that

474
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,080
all gambling houses need to record their revenues by real names.

475
00:29:09,650 --> 00:29:11,210
It's very easy

476
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,600
to find any falsification.

477
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,240
That's right.

478
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,460
Also, in this competition,

479
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,220
the ledgers of Liansheng House

480
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,180
and Tang's Gambling House must be made public.

481
00:29:19,850 --> 00:29:21,640
Many eyes are watching us now.

482
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,020
Lots of people are plotting against us.

483
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,780
If they find out that we tamper with the ledger,

484
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,540
we'll lose this round.

485
00:29:38,970 --> 00:29:39,520
Miss Shu.

486
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,640
The second day is coming.

487
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:44,500
Yes.

488
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,750
Mr. Su.

489
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:02,860
[If Liansheng House wins, the bet-to-payout ratio will be 1:7.]

490
00:29:57,110 --> 00:30:02,860
[If Tang's Gambling House wins, the bet-to-payout ratio will be 1:2.]

491
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:59,700
If Liansheng House wins, the bet-to-payout ratio will be 1:7.

492
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,280
If Tang's Gambling House wins, the bet-to-payout ratio will be 1:2.

493
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:03,970
Mr. Su,

494
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,300
what is this?

495
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,940
Liansheng House and Tang's Gambling House

496
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:08,160
are competing on revenues.

497
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,850
I believe you all know that.

498
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:11,920
Don't you want to bet on

499
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,650
who will win in the end?

500
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,940
But the bet-to-payout ratio of 1:7 is too high.

501
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,200
You are all savvy players.

502
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,970
I believe you can tell that if we rely on our usual operations only,

503
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:23,660
it will be hard for us to beat Tang's Gambling House.

504
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,220
The probability of winning is low

505
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:26,990
and of course, the payout rate is high.

506
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:31,880
But no matter how high the payout rate is,

507
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,230
if Liansheng House can't win, we can't earn the money.

508
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,120
This is tricky.

509
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:35,010
Yeah.

510
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,040
But no matter which party you bet on,

511
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,700
your bets are part of our revenues.

512
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,180
I'd like to thank you in advance.

513
00:30:42,950 --> 00:30:44,560
If that's the case,

514
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,420
the more we bet, the more revenue you can make.

515
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,590
Then there is a greater chance of winning.

516
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,320
Let's go.

517
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:55,700
Master.

518
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:57,140
You also want to set up the external game?

519
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,050
Yes.

520
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,420
Tang's Gambling House

521
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:01,430
and all its branches are going to do so.

522
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:02,550
Master.

523
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:03,780
Brilliant idea.

524
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:06,460
There is only a certain number of gamblers in Nandu.

525
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,150
If you set up external games in all your gambling houses,

526
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,940
gamblers will have more options.

527
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:12,740
In this way,

528
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,710
Liansheng House won't make much money.

529
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,420
What's wrong with Yun Xiang?

530
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,220
I admit

531
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,990
he's quite resourceful.

532
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,700
But the key to winning this competition is wealth.

533
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:24,540
Right?

534
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,640
With how little money he has,

535
00:31:27,710 --> 00:31:29,190
he can't achieve anything

536
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,130
no matter how smart he is.

537
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,570
That's right.

538
00:31:31,810 --> 00:31:32,160
Do it!

539
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,000
There are so many plants in our yard.

540
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:39,800
But you favor this one.

541
00:31:54,890 --> 00:31:55,350
Miss,

542
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,980
I can do it in person.

543
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,620
I'll make sure no one knows.

544
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:04,890
Rong,

545
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,950
you made the promise

546
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,300
when you were dying.

547
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,530
You promised that if you could survive,

548
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,820
you would hang it up

549
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,840
and would never hurt anyone again.

550
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:18,300
I remember.

551
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:20,860
Of course I remember.

552
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,760
Even if we put aside Tang Xiao,

553
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,070
in order to protect Mingyu,

554
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:30,020
it's nothing

555
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,210
if I break my promise.

556
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,520
But now Tang Xiao is confronting Yun Xiang.

557
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,940
They are fighting with wisdom but not violence.

558
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,250
What's wrong with that?

559
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:46,300
But there's one thing I don't understand.

560
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:50,060
Why did Yun Xiang choose to compete

561
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,160
with Tang's Gambling House on revenues?

562
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:55,370
This is clearly against the common sense of business.

563
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:58,640
He used the Tang family to take down Qi Tianfeng.

564
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,540
And now he's confronting Tang Xiao aggressively.

565
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:06,320
His enemies are the biggest merchants in Nandu.

566
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,870
If he wins again,

567
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,620
what will he do next?

568
00:33:15,250 --> 00:33:16,530
He'll deal with the Su family.

569
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,380
I give up.

570
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,860
You're having fun.

571
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,940
I have no one else to play go with.

572
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,630
I can only kill time in this way.

573
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,120
Do I dare to play go with you?

574
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,200
I lost every time I played with you.

575
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,460
I've learned my lesson.

576
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:03,730
Here.

577
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:08,800
When playing go,

578
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,350
you can't retract your moves.

579
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,270
First, don't be greedy.

580
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,370
Second, don't rush blindly into the opponent's territory.

581
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,580
Third, be well-prepared while attacking the other.

582
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,750
Four, sacrifice to gain sente.

583
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:22,360
Five, discard the small to save the big.

584
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:25,540
Every move is very interesting.

585
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,040
Why are you laughing?

586
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,929
Things are chaotic

587
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,139
and disorderly out there.

588
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,610
The Tang and Su family and your Miss Shu

589
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,710
are turning Liansheng House upside down.

590
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:48,449
But you are having fun here.

591
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,800
You consider this as chaotic?

592
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,330
I want to make things worse.

593
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:38,790
To suppress the poison.

594
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,440
Master.

595
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:52,750
Let me see.

596
00:35:54,210 --> 00:35:54,800
Does it hurt?

597
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,730
You can like anyone you want.

598
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,090
But you have to choose that rough.

599
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,220
Have you learned your lesson?

600
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:09,140
Yun Xiang is really a tough guy.

601
00:36:09,810 --> 00:36:11,870
He attracted people to bet on our competition.

602
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:12,870
Well, I have to admit

603
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,540
it's a good way to increase the revenue.

604
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,140
Master, will you lose?

605
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,140
What do you think, Tianhu?

606
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,390
Liansheng House stayed open last night.

607
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:32,140
They aren't lagging behind too much.

608
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:34,960
Come on.

609
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,420
You're so cute.

610
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:41,650
Speaking of Ke Menglan,

611
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,370
as she keeps an eye on you every day,

612
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,740
how did you manage to come here?

613
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,380
You are my master.

614
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,030
I should be by your side.

615
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,820
It would be nice if she

616
00:36:58,610 --> 00:37:00,650
can be half as sweet as you.

617
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:03,820
Miss Ke obeys your orders.

618
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,830
But why is she helping Liansheng House?

619
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,420
I also want to know why.

620
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,720
Ask her for me

621
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:15,270
if she still wants her Elevation Certificate.

622
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,680
If she doesn't want it,

623
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,110
I'll burn it

624
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,140
since I don't need it anyway.

625
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,460
She wants it.

626
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:27,700
Come back.

627
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,980
After you go back, check on Yun Xiang for me.

628
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,340
Since the third round started,

629
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,060
he's been hiding in his room.

630
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,820
Go and check if he's in his room

631
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,560
and if he is, what he's doing.

632
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,520
Master, please teach me what to say

633
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:49,430
and what to do.

634
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:08,050
You may leave.

635
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:11,870
What's wrong?

636
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:13,970
Tang Xiao imitated us

637
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,530
and ordered all his gambling houses

638
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,940
to set up external games.

639
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:18,570
Then,

640
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:20,660
fewer players

641
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,560
will place their bets here.

642
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,690
You stayed up all night. Go back and rest.

643
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,660
The competition is so fierce.

644
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,840
In such a situation,

645
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,240
how can I sleep?

646
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,860
It is at this crucial moment that you can't be flustered.

647
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,580
Go and have a rest.

648
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,550
I'll take care of this.

649
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,480
Tianhu.

650
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:11,260
Didn't I tell you

651
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,660
not to disturb Mr. Yun?

652
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,300
Miss Shu.

653
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,490
The cook just made some soup.

654
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:19,960
I thought Mr. Yun would like it.

655
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,740
Did you really injure your face

656
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,100
because you fell down?

657
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,720
Yes, I wasn't paying attention while walking.

658
00:39:37,050 --> 00:39:38,350
Is Mr. Yun inside?

659
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,390
Is that what you should ask?

660
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,160
Don't you know the rules?

661
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:44,720
What are the rules?

662
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:46,660
To help Mr. Yun win,

663
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,680
Liansheng House has changed the rules several times.

664
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:50,550
We also set up external games.

665
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,990
We are losing money. This is so ridiculous.

666
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,880
If Mr. Yun had run away,

667
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,420
who would take care of the mess?

668
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,020
Tianhu.

669
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,010
How rude!

670
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,780
Apologize to Miss Shu.

671
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,740
Miss Shu, I'm sorry.

672
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,440
Miss Shu.

673
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:16,270
We've been very busy these days.

674
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,700
It's inevitable that we'll make some mistakes.

675
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,460
Please forgive us.

676
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,260
I will discipline her.

677
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,340
Let's go.

678
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,360
What happened?

679
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:39,050
When did you switch to Tang Xiao's side?

680
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:41,200
Miss,

681
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,590
you are really a bitch.

682
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,220
You are also on Master's side

683
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:50,280
but you always help Liansheng House.

684
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,230
This is not something you would say.

685
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:01,980
Tell me.

686
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,760
Is Tang Xiao forcing you?

687
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,910
Is he threatening you with Jin's life?

688
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:14,100
Tianhu.

689
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:16,900
Tang Xiao kidnapped Jin

690
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,640
to threaten Mr. Yun.

691
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,090
As long as Mr. Yun wins,

692
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,300
he will find a way to save Jin.

693
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:26,040
Understand?

694
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,010
Master won't hurt Jin.

695
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,750
Master also said

696
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,500
he would make Jin marry me

697
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,480
if he could win Yun Xiang.

698
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,300
Stop calling him Master.

699
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,490
Master wanted me to ask you

700
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:52,340
if you want the Elevation Certificate or not.

701
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:53,140
You...

702
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,830
You want the benefits of both sides.

703
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,020
How despicable!

704
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,050
You...

705
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,060
I see.

706
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:32,520
It looks like Master can burn the certificate.

707
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:48,310
Tianhu.

708
00:42:50,890 --> 00:42:52,310
Tianhu. Tianhu.

709
00:43:12,430 --> 00:43:13,300
You're poisoned.

710
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:18,660
Poisoned?

711
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:21,830
You must be kidding.

712
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,810
Master found out that I have an incurable disease.

713
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:28,320
I must take his medicine every day to stay alive.

714
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,140
Master also said

715
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:37,760
if he loses this round, he won't give me any more medicine.

716
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:40,960
Miss.

717
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,180
If I die,

718
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,360
bury me.

719
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,140
Don't talk nonsense.

720
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,220
I won't let you die.

721
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:54,050
I won't let you die.

722
00:43:57,410 --> 00:43:59,180
Then, let's help Master, okay?

723
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,090
Let's help him win this game.

724
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,750
So that Master can win,

725
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:07,780
and you can be elevated out of lowly status.
