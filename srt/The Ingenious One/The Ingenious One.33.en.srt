[Episode 33: Meeting the Real Yuntai]

4
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,280
With such a crisis within the sect,

5
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,039
and Yuntai suddenly inviting us to an alliance,

6
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,979
I'm afraid it's not a coincidence.

7
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,750
Mother,

8
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,060
how about we just find some excuse and refuse it?

9
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,120
There's no turning back

10
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,890
for Lingyuan.

11
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,340
Mother,

12
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,300
I've thought about it many times.

13
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,150
I still don't want you to take the risk yourself.

14
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,079
Why not I head over myself,

15
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,930
while you guys wait outside the mountain gates?

16
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:20,960
No.

17
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,060
The situation today

18
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,660
is a result of my own decision.

19
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,070
I won't let you take the risk for me.

20
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,290
We can let Sister sound out what is the situation really like,

21
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:31,590
while Mother and I can plan and respond accordingly outside the mountain gates.

22
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:35,530
Two thousand of the sect's elites died in Yangzhou.

23
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:37,370
After that, Yuntai followed us closely.

24
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,440
Isn't it clear that they are hiding something?

25
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,770
If any of you do not dare to come with me,

26
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,250
you can leave now.

27
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,620
Death is just death.

28
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,190
Mother,

29
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:00,780
I'm not afraid of death.

30
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,420
I just don't understand

31
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,410
why we must follow Yuntai's wishes.

32
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:07,470
What a fool.

33
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,440
The chaos in Yangzhou

34
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,580
has drained all of Lingyuan's money.

35
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,020
The rations at each branch have already been cut.

36
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:18,270
It's hard to say if they can survive this winter.

37
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,240
An alliance with Yuntai

38
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,230
can bring us a glimmer of hope.

39
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,120
It's better than the destruction of Lingyuan.

40
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,150
So what

41
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,350
if I just suffer a little?

[Yuntai]

43
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,440
You have never met our Master in person

44
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,230
even as a direct disciple?

45
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,220
You have learned to be cunning.

46
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,750
The skill that I taught you, Run for Ten Breaths, has indeed been proven useful.

47
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,320
It's all thanks to you Mr. Zhong.

48
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:15,710
This skill alone has helped me escape death many times.

49
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,529
Do you think everyone here

50
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,190
doesn't know the real identity of our Master,

51
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:23,590
just like us?

52
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,490
I'm not sure.

53
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:28,610
I think they all have their own concerns.

54
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,410
Senior Mo,

55
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,160
how much do you know?

56
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,740
Master is here.

57
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,980
You ignored the rules of the sect

58
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,030
and fought with your senior.

59
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:04,840
How could you let down the many years of tough training?

60
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,780
Greetings, Your Highness.

61
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,980
How do you know this is Prince Fu?

62
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,820
Are you not afraid that you could have mistaken him for someone else?

63
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,900
This is Mr. Yun?

64
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,860
Just as I have heard,

65
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,020
your presence is indeed quite extraordinary.

66
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,630
What are you planning

67
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,780
when you got him to gather all his assets?

68
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,710
Nangong Fang has countless properties.

69
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,480
If we break them up one by one,

70
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,740
it will not only take time and effort,

71
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,340
but it will also easily raise their suspicion.

72
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:46,640
This is a good idea.

73
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,120
Don't worry.

74
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,790
I have always kept my word.

75
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:57,870
I wonder how much you

76
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,790
actually know about Prince Fu?

77
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:01,890
About five points?

78
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:02,700
At most one point.

79
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,240
Please tell me everything you know.

80
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,330
How can it be Prince Fu?

81
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:16,060
What prince?

82
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:30,700
Rise.

83
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,060
Everyone,

84
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,330
some of you may know who I am,

85
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,740
but most people had no chance of knowing.

86
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,470
I am the fourth brother of His Majesty.

87
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,520
I have been bestowed the title of Prince Fu.

88
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,200
I've been the Master of Yuntai

89
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,940
for over 20 years.

90
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,120
Because of my identity as a prince,

91
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:57,710
it has been inconvenient for me to meet all of you in person.

92
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:01,430
There are many rules within Yuntai,

93
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,040
one of which is to not have any dealings with the officials.

94
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,280
From now on, do I address you as Master

95
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,780
or Prince Fu?

96
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,330
Mr. Zhong,

97
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,950
your question

98
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,250
must also be on the mind of many others.

99
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,450
How many more secrets are there in this mountain?

100
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,400
It's not appropriate for me to tell you,

101
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:37,900
and I cannot tell you.

102
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,610
There's no need to say anything.

103
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:48,330
Don’t any of you have anything to say?

104
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,159
Am I just old and stubborn,

105
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,830
or are you guys just following the trend?

106
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:57,970
Mr. Zhong,

107
00:07:58,810 --> 00:07:59,690
that's a bit harsh, isn't it?

108
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,630
I've been devoted to martial arts all my life.

109
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:06,790
I don't like to listen to things that are ambiguous.

110
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,230
So, why not you come clean

111
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:11,350
and tell us why are you revealing your true identity today?

112
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:13,310
Of course, there is a big deal.

113
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:14,820
Everyone,

114
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,240
if our country

115
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,230
was run in the ways of Yuntai,

116
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,210
it would definitely have been a better country.

117
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,180
My brother is now old

118
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,470
and seriously ill.

119
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,430
The Crown Prince is still young.

120
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,370
When he ascends to the throne,

121
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,730
it will definitely be the Empress who takes the rein.

122
00:08:29,490 --> 00:08:30,530
The country will be in chaos.

123
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,419
If we use our power

124
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,340
to secure the country,

125
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,789
we are saving the world from danger and hardship

126
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,120
with the heart of a Bodhisattva.

127
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,530
I already have a perfect plan.

128
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,490
You need to make your own decision

129
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,700
on whether or not you want to follow me.

130
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,370
Those who have objections,

131
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,920
please leave now.

132
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,390
Stop! Stop right there!

133
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:52,940
Where are you going?

134
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,790
I have to stop Master.

135
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:56,880
With his temper,

136
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:58,180
he will definitely be impulsive.

137
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,620
Use your brain.

138
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,300
Who is Zhong Beidou?

139
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,870
He is the patriarch of the seniors.

140
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,030
Unless he assassinates Prince Fu,

141
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,710
no one dares to hurt him.

142
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,140
Besides, if we really fight,

143
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,840
who can be an opponent of that old monster?

144
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,340
But...

145
00:10:11,430 --> 00:10:12,500
Can you really change

146
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,960
this situation?

147
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,210
Listen to Yun Xiang.

148
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:16,720
Don't be the one that stands out.

149
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,110
Do you remember?

150
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,180
Now, the arrow is already on the string.

151
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,210
I have no choice but to pull it.

152
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,310
Will you be willing to help me?

153
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:38,370
You already have the support of the seniors in the sect.

154
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:41,980
It doesn't matter if I help you or not.

155
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:43,940
How can you tell that

156
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,860
I have already convinced the seniors in the sect?

157
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:49,030
Everything you said today

158
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,140
goes against the rules of the sect.

159
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,360
If they are all going to be against the idea,

160
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,420
it'll be hard to put an end to it.

161
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,930
If it were me,

162
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,800
I would also have set the big picture first,

163
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:04,270
and then put on a show to gather the hearts of the masses.

164
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,010
In other words,

165
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,230
those who don't know about what is going on,

166
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,180
are people you can't trust.

167
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,060
I just want to know

168
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:14,110
what are you planning to do with us?

169
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:22,520
Mingzhu,

170
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,610
tell me what we should do.

171
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:32,930
It's okay,

172
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,240
I will still need your help in the future.

173
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:36,630
Just tell me.

174
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,370
Those who want to achieve great things

175
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,610
cannot do it all on their own.

176
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,500
They cannot do without the help of competent people.

177
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:50,210
Should we then put an end

178
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,790
to those who are disloyal?

179
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,020
Father,

180
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,520
you said we must embrace the world with benevolence.

181
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,780
Of course, you'll remain benevolent in your means.

182
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,580
Yun Xiang.

183
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:11,030
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

184
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,340
You forced me to do it.

185
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,610
I asked you to go to Yuezhou to handle the affairs there,

186
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:22,050
but you insisted on seeking justice for Wen Cong.

187
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:25,220
You went to Nandu without permission and caused trouble,

188
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:27,480
which messed up my plans.

189
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:29,740
If I’m not wrong,

190
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,310
you arranged for Mr. Wen's death, right?

191
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:35,400
Wen Cong met into trouble

192
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:37,690
because he couldn't distinguish between good and bad people.

193
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,330
After Mr. Wen died,

194
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:41,720
Nangong Fang should have been stationed in Nandu, right?

195
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,000
It seems you have figured out a few points.

196
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:49,960
Not just a few,

197
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,960
I have seen through the entire plot.

198
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,260
You are being arrogant.

199
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,030
After all, my master is famous.

200
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,030
Don't you dare be rude to Prince Fu!

201
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:05,100
Father,

202
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,600
Yun Xiang was just... being careless.

203
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:10,680
It doesn't matter.

204
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,870
There is no prince here,

205
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,980
but only a pair of Yuntai's master and disciple.

206
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,960
I’ve been thoroughly investigating Mr. Wen’s death.

207
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:30,250
When I found out that Nangong Fang is the culprit behind the scenes,

208
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,470
I kept pressing him.

209
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,110
That was what forced Lingyuan to let Nangong Fang come to Nandu,

210
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,390
in order to compete with me.

211
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,060
Nangong Fang then took advantage of the situation,

212
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,150
and transferred Lingyuan's assets to Yuntai.

213
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:47,550
And all of this is part of your plan, right?

214
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:50,620
That's right.

215
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,040
I asked Nangong Fang to hide within Lingyuan for 15 years,

216
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:56,860
and we finally achieved great results.

217
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,610
The transfer of their assets

218
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,530
has basically disintegrated their foundation.

219
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,740
But, you added more to it.

220
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,740
Under the guise of stealing accounts,

221
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,360
you forced the elite of Lingyuan to sneak into Yangzhou,

222
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,280
where they were severely injured.

223
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:13,460
There's no need to verify the past.

224
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:16,510
I want to guess what's going to happen in the future.

225
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,750
Well then, tell me

226
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,820
how you think I will make use of Lingyuan.

227
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,970
There are many people in the Lingyuan Sect,

228
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,890
and they are scattered everywhere.

229
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,250
If they attack separately,

230
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:35,010
the court will surely disperse troops to suppress them.

231
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,740
With this opportunity,

232
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,590
you can easily mobilize

233
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,980
the troops of Nandu and Yangzhou.

234
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,280
By leveraging on the perils of the Yangtze River,

235
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:45,210
we can attack or defend.

236
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,740
Master Guan has taken control of the Three Oceans and Seven Islands.

237
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,020
We must not underestimate his current power.

238
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:56,110
I believe you will not let his assistance slip through your hands.

239
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,820
Can mere pirates be of great use?

240
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,080
You're mistaken.

241
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:03,070
With the help of the pirates,

242
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,420
you can grasp the imperial court's deployment of the coastal defense.

243
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,570
I wonder

244
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,790
if there's anything wrong about what I just said?

245
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:16,820
You've been training for 15 years

246
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:18,250
and have seen all kinds of things in the world,

247
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,470
but you're still so proud and arrogant.

248
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,330
You don't know how to hide your brilliance.

249
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:27,660
Are you not worried that I might have my concerns?

250
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,620
As you have said just now,

251
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,580
you should at least have someone useful by your side

252
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:40,400
if you want to do something big.

253
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,300
I was right about you.

254
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,830
All right, take a rest.

255
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:52,950
I'll take you to meet some old friends later.

256
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,070
His talent is truly unmatched.

257
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,790
If he can be used by me,

258
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,480
the great plan will be successful.

259
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:18,570
Father,

260
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,740
when I first came to Nandu,

261
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,320
I saw that Yun Xiang and Uncle Liu were very close.

262
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:27,100
Now that Yun Xiang has guessed your plans,

263
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,280
what should we do if

264
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,900
he really goes to form an alliance with Uncle Liu?

265
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,290
You've made progress in just a few days.

266
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,620
But don't worry,

267
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:43,700
I have thought this through.

268
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:46,040
Yun Xiang is from Yuntai.

269
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:48,130
He's never been tolerated by the imperial court.

270
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,940
Even if they had colluded,

271
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,710
they only know of one of my plans,

272
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,490
but not the other.

273
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,520
Thank you for your help in this matter, Eunuch Liu.

274
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:11,500
Actually, there is one thing I don't understand.

275
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,710
In the past, it has always been the case that we wait for His Majesty's decree

276
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:18,819
for the selection of royal silk suppliers.

277
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,619
So, why is the magistrate making a decision now?

278
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,500
Well...

279
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,300
Of course, this is not Mr. Shao's idea.

280
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,830
Eunuch Liu, you haven't heard of it, have you?

281
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,640
Mr. Shao died from an alcohol overdose yesterday.

282
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,870
It was Prince Fu's decision

283
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,730
to pick the Su family.

284
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:45,120
You don't need me to tell you exactly

285
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,830
what you should be doing, right?

286
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,470
Well, I understand it now.

287
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,710
Since this is Prince Fu's order,

288
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:58,220
I'll see to it right away.

289
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:04,100
I will still need to trouble you

290
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:08,020
for the position of magistrate in the Nandu Prefecture.

291
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:10,450
How about this?

292
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,790
I'll write a letter immediately.

293
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,610
Pick a fast horse and

294
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:17,550
make the trip to Dongting Post personally.

295
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,930
Eunuch Liu, sorry to scare you.

296
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,500
No...

297
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:42,840
What's this?

298
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:44,620
If we were one step late,

299
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,940
I'm afraid there would also be news

300
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,140
about your sudden death today.

301
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,540
Except for Shao Yiheng,

302
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,220
Chief Army Wu, who was guarding the government office yesterday,

303
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,430
also died of sudden illness.

304
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:53,920
His deputy general took over the role of the Chief of Army,

305
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,200
and as soon as he took office, he switched the guards at each gate.

306
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,330
In that case,

307
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,110
I am afraid the entire military power of Nandu

308
00:19:02,730 --> 00:19:04,930
has fallen into the hands

309
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,050
of Prince Fu.

310
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:09,450
The present situation is still uncertain.

311
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,000
Will you be willing to trust me?

312
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:37,670
[Empress Guo]

313
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,710
I am Liu Gongquan.

314
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,740
Greetings, Your Majesty.

315
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,020
Your Majesty!

316
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,440
I, Liu Chen,

317
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:52,260
send my greetings to you, Your Majesty.

318
00:19:54,410 --> 00:19:55,150
Rise.

319
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:56,960
This is not the palace.

320
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,430
Let's keep things simple.

321
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,650
Thank you, Your Majesty.

322
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:07,870
I'm incompetent.

323
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,280
I was only in time to save Eunuch Liu.

324
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,620
Any important official in Nandu

325
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,220
who does not collude with Prince Fu,

326
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:18,560
is likely to have all been killed.

327
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,570
Your Majesty,

328
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,710
my heart is filled with fear.

329
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,550
You are a lady of great wealth,

330
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:31,830
yet you have condescended to

331
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,560
wearing such a simple dress today.

332
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:38,440
Has the Beidu Palace also...

333
00:20:41,330 --> 00:20:42,090
also...

334
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:45,700
Lord Liu,

335
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,750
I will need Eunuch Liu to provide a helping hand from now on.

336
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,660
Update him about the current situation.

337
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,280
Yes.

338
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,960
I managed to gather another piece of information.

339
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,740
Prince Fu may have another identity.

340
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,390
He is the current master of Yuntai.

341
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,620
All these years, Prince Fu's power

342
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,250
has already penetrated the whole country.

343
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,340
Many of his accomplices are lurking

344
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,030
and working for him,

345
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,730
even in the courts of Beidu.

346
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,220
No wonder he could always

347
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,660
retreat entirely from Beidu every single time.

348
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,650
The Emperor is getting older and he's indisposed.

349
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,080
But in consideration of their brotherhood,

350
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,570
he has yet to make up his mind to get rid of the hidden danger.

351
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,190
I found out that Prince Fu has bribed

352
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,440
officials from each state and prefecture,

353
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,530
when I was visiting all over Jiangnan

354
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,780
under the guise of investigations.

355
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,290
Among them, the Nandu prefecture in Yangzhou is the most important.

356
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,950
He often uses the bait of higher ranks,

357
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,070
which he can never get in his lifetime,

358
00:21:40,130 --> 00:21:42,480
to win over those lower-ranking official for his own use.

359
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,690
And his methods are extremely well-hidden.

360
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,810
When he rebels,

361
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,230
those officials who are loyal to the court

362
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,740
would have become figureheads a long while ago.

363
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,420
It's all a sham.

364
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,010
Young Master Xiang is also from Yuntai.

365
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:58,400
Why do you trust him so much?

366
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:00,670
Young Master Xiang has an agreement with me.

367
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:03,580
He is my spy I planted next to Prince Fu.

368
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,070
Are you very sure that

369
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:07,610
Lingyuan will fall into Prince Fu's hands?

370
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,780
He has ordered Nangong Fang to pull the carpet from under Lingyuan

371
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,450
by cutting off Lingyuan's financial resources.

372
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:14,470
There's no better time than this.

373
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,460
But, there's still a bigger problem.

374
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:18,540
The coastal defense.

375
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,320
The coastal border guards change their posts

376
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,050
and commanders every year.

377
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,460
How could they be easily bribed over by Prince Fu?

378
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:26,790
He meant the problem of pirates.

379
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:28,500
Eunuch Liu.

380
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,850
Yes, Your Majesty.

381
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:32,200
Take over the position of Imperial Envoy immediately,

382
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,200
go to the various border garrisons,

383
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:36,180
and pass on the order for the warships to leave the port and form up,

384
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:37,400
in order to be ready for battle anytime.

385
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,540
I'll do anything and not resign from death.

386
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,130
What you said just now is very clear.

387
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,820
My knowledge of Prince Fu

388
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,700
is indeed very shallow.

389
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,210
But where will Lingyuan cause chaos?

390
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,040
Where will the pirates attack?

391
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,700
If we can't find out what's going on,

392
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,030
I am afraid we can't help.

393
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,040
By that time, the court can only suppress the rebellion with heavy troops.

394
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,540
The various prefectures in Jiangnan

395
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:01,900
will still be inevitably caught in the disaster.

396
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,890
Master should be recalling me back to the headquarters by now.

397
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,400
Once I find out anything,

398
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,610
I'll tell you right away.

399
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,000
With your devotion to help,

400
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,810
are you truly not afraid of being killed?

401
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,550
One must act on their words and keep to their promises.

402
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,050
With all due respect,

403
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,910
you were not a righteous man in the past.

404
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,030
Do you have any other considerations,

405
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,980
or is this really still about avenging your family?

406
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:36,970
I don't believe that

407
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,620
you do not have a trace of guilt for Prince Fu.

408
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,250
But, you still chose justice.

409
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,970
In view of the bloodshed of our brothers,

410
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:42,750
or framing it on one's father,

411
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,050
it's hard to justify

412
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,840
not getting rid of him.

413
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:20,220
Yuntai's disciple Nangong Fang welcomes Madam Kou.

414
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:26,200
I have just been following orders all these years.

415
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:27,960
I seek your forgiveness

416
00:24:28,210 --> 00:24:29,490
if I have offended you in any way.

417
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,780
The fact that I am willing to come this time around,

418
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,220
means that I have let bygones be bygones.

419
00:24:35,950 --> 00:24:38,380
Mr. Nangong, please lead the way.

420
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,180
Please.

421
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,060
This alliance is of great importance.

422
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,440
Why don't you let me share the full details with you?

423
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:48,440
Alright.

424
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,640
[Yunhe Realm]

425
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,820
Prince Fu,

426
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,260
you have set up a really big game.

427
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,820
I see this is why the master of Yuntai

428
00:25:12,430 --> 00:25:13,430
hasn't shown up for over 30 years.

429
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,810
I didn't lose too terribly, didn't I?

430
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,780
Madam Kou, you are indeed an exceptional character.

431
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:31,650
Since you already know my identity,

432
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,220
there's no need to say more

433
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:35,290
as to why I am here, right?

434
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,360
I have already known for a long time.

435
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:40,520
Otherwise, why would I

436
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:41,860
take some interest in this alliance?

437
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:43,570
Mother,

438
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,200
he is the prince of an illegitimate reign!

439
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:45,890
Shut up!

440
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,300
You have no right to speak.

441
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,730
Madam Kou, calm down.

442
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:54,930
Only the winner has the final say as to whether it is legitimate or not.

443
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,880
Do you really think you are the winner?

444
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,970
To be honest,

445
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:05,980
if you are willing to help me,

446
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,100
I'm 70% sure.

447
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:12,800
You are interested in the branches of Lingyuan, aren't you?

448
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,560
The people of Lingyuan are all brave and righteous fighters.

449
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,850
They are the kind of help I require urgently.

450
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,310
It's beneficial, isn't it?

451
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:31,230
Madam Kou, you worry too much.

452
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,300
I've plotted this for more than ten years.

453
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,980
When I regain power of the world,

454
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:37,920
I will definitely tell everyone the truth of what happened.

455
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,260
I will tell everyone that the people of Lingyuan are loyal and righteous.

456
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,820
Lingyuan will no longer be despised

457
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:48,390
or suffer from the misery of being displaced.

458
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,640
Madam Kou,

459
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:53,520
isn't it an outcome that generations of Lingyuan's ancestors

460
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,830
have been pursuing?

461
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,670
This is an important matter.

462
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,350
You don't have to rush into giving an answer.

463
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,530
We didn't serve you well.

464
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,810
I asked them to bring some tea.

465
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,300
If you have something that you want to say, just say it.

466
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:58,660
No need for tea.

467
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,830
Is it too much to ask

468
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,320
for old friends to catch up over tea?

469
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:09,720
Let's get down to business.

470
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:10,980
You came

471
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,920
to ask me something.

472
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,700
What does the Kou family think

473
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:19,620
about the alliance?

474
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,800
Lingyuan fought for 100 years

475
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,350
just to clear our ancestors from

476
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,670
the accusation of being rebels.

477
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:27,960
If we form an alliance with Yuntai now,

478
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,190
it would be a great opportunity to survive.

479
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,460
What about you, Yanan?

480
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:37,470
What do you think?

481
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:43,860
My name is Kou Lianyi.

482
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:44,710
It doesn't matter.

483
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,400
I'm Kou Lianyi.

484
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,110
I just want the best for the Kou family.

485
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,000
Since we're forming an alliance,

486
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:15,670
I also want to do my best as a host.

487
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:17,730
Why don't we

488
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:19,210
go admire the moonlight of Yuntai together?

489
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:25,850
How about I order two more jars of wine?

490
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:29,580
I'll carry you back when you're drunk.

491
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,220
Let's go.

492
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,080
Actually, there were many times,

493
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,540
I thought of bringing you here.

494
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,110
I wanted you to see the place where I was training at for 15 years.

495
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,620
I just didn't expect

496
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:33,860
it would happen under such a circumstance.

497
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:35,510
I never realized it is actually

498
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:40,000
so challenging to climb this mountain.

499
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,580
Let me carry you.

500
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:51,230
Sure.

501
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,430
Prince Fu said the chaos this time

502
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,730
will be bloodless.

503
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:34,800
What do you think?

504
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,460
Since ancient times,

505
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,470
was there ever a battle of power that

506
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,820
did not result in corpses strewn all over the field?

507
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,380
What are you thinking?

508
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,880
I am thinking about how it has been years

509
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,200
since I got a moment of peace like this.

510
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,310
Indeed.

511
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:14,930
Back then, I came to Yuntai to train

512
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:17,450
so that I could have better certainty over my revenge.

513
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:19,140
But later I found out,

514
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,800
Yuntai also promoted the principles of using one's self-cultivation to help the world

515
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:24,830
and stabilize the country.

516
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,740
What I yearned for was that

517
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,300
if I am able to provide for

518
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,390
the old and the young,

519
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,920
and if just one person in this world have a peace of mind because of me,

520
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:37,890
my life would have been worthwhile.

521
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,490
But unfortunately,

522
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:44,180
if one wants revenge, he will definitely bleed,

523
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,400
and he will definitely plant many seeds of hatred in his heart.

524
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,410
This destroys the peace of the world without a doubt.

525
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,180
I may be the eldest daughter of Lingyuan,

526
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,450
and I've been used to bloodshed since I was young,

527
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,430
but I have no ambition.

528
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,130
I just wanted to wander in the martial world and be chivalrous.

529
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,660
You and I...

530
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:12,340
You want revenge, yet you want to protect the people.

531
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,660
I can't abandon my family,

532
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:17,690
but I desire to be free.

533
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:22,240
All our wishes run contrary to what we have.

534
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:26,330
Not really.

535
00:33:27,810 --> 00:33:30,160
Maybe, there is a way to have the best of both worlds.

536
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,950
I've found the enemy I've been looking for.

537
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:36,590
Who?

538
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,740
Nangong Fang,

539
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,940
and maybe Prince Fu.

540
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,650
But when you were with them today,

541
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,250
I didn't notice anything unusual about you.

542
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,460
I was devoted to revenge

543
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,870
and sacrificed so many people around me.

544
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:56,280
It's a big price to pay.

545
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,820
When I saw Nangong Fang again,

546
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:02,050
I just felt that he was very insignificant.

547
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:04,180
The pain that I had suffered from

548
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,960
has already long exceeded the hatred in my heart.

549
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,199
Let's get down to business.

550
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:38,830
You address him as Prince Fu,

551
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,290
but never as Master.

552
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,810
On the way here, you have been talking about how the human heart is greedy.

553
00:34:47,969 --> 00:34:48,560
What do you want

554
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:51,139
to see me for?

555
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,699
What is this perfect plan

556
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:55,389
that you just mentioned?

557
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:04,110
There are two choices in front of Lingyuan.

558
00:35:07,610 --> 00:35:08,840
You either join hands with Prince Fu,

559
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,710
and enable him to make use of the entire Lingyuan,

560
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,880
or join hands with me

561
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:20,130
to nip this catastrophe in the bud,

562
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:24,170
where we can even clear Lingyuan's name from being a rebel faction.

563
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,090
Even if I manage to persuade Mother,

564
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,980
Lingyuan is still in a difficult position to protect ourselves.

565
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:33,300
Besides, you're just one person.

566
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:35,970
How can you fight against Prince Fu who has been planning for years?

567
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,350
I have my own ways.

568
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,330
How can you tell me such things?

569
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,380
Have you forgotten how I deceived you?

570
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:04,560
All that Lingyuan needs to do to surrender is to take a pledge.

571
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,410
If I pass your words to Prince Fu,

572
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,220
you will die without a complete body

573
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,260
even if you are his direct disciple.

574
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:15,850
You won't.

575
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:18,850
You won't lie to me.

576
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:21,350
I trust you.

577
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,520
I have always trusted you.

578
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,550
I'll pretend I didn't hear

579
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:37,840
what you said tonight

580
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,300
♫It's dark but friends are not back♫

581
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:09,580
♫The night breeze can't understand sadness and heartache♫

582
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:13,840
♫Rain falls all night long and I stay awake♫

00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:19,380
♫The night rain can't conceal the sorrow♫

584
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:23,880
♫Memory is a book♫

585
00:37:25,070 --> 00:37:29,050
♫Who wrote all those stories♫

586
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,070
What took you so long?

587
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:33,650
♫Without realizing it♫

588
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,530
I have been waiting for you for so long.

589
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,070
Have you really forgiven me?

590
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:38,920
♫So many years have passed♫

591
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:42,030
♫Flowers fall into the garden♫

♫Destiny is so cruel♫

594
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:54,340
How can I blame you?

♫The cloud disperses and mountains are seen♫

596
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,970

♫Stories take place thousands of miles away♫

608
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:01,270
You are up.

609
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:02,600
Mother.

610
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,470
I woke up at dawn,

611
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,450
and practiced for a while.

612
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:07,770
Have you had your breakfast?

613
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,100
All these years,

614
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,360
I have never seen you sleep in.

615
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,920
Actually, I just realised that

616
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:23,020
it was your intention to stop Yuan Jie from going to Yangzhou.

617
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,060
If he did go,

618
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,120
I'm afraid he wouldn't come back.

619
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,230
All these years,

620
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,700
I've been focused on matters within the sect,

621
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,470
and I have been very strict with you.

622
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,310
I hope you don't blame me.

623
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:45,450
I am just glad that I can be with you.

624
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,050
Is this hairpin

625
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:59,170
given to you by someone you like?

626
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,420
It's just nice to use.

627
00:40:02,450 --> 00:40:03,420
I picked it out randomly.

628
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:07,540
You can't hide it.

629
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:09,470
Mother, let me do it myself.

630
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,900
Let me help you.

631
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,480
Don't keep it from me.

632
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,360
You've been in the sect for so long,

633
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,070
but I've never seen you wear this hairpin before.

634
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,550
You treat it as a treasure.

635
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:30,390
I've neglected you all these years.

636
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,410
Actually, I really hope

637
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:37,730
you can find someone who takes good care of you.

638
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,410
Mother,

639
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:46,660
what are your thoughts

640
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,480
regarding the alliance?

641
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,360
I haven't decided yet.

642
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,340
Lingyuan's power is long gone.

643
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:03,120
Your brother

644
00:41:05,530 --> 00:41:06,850
is still unreliable.

645
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,290
You called me here early in the morning

646
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:18,790
just to find out more about the alliance, right?

647
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,630
Does Lingyuan

648
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,900
have other choices besides the alliance?

649
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,340
You're here to humiliate me.

650
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,720
Why do you say that?

651
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:36,310
You and I are also considered rivals.

652
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,330
Now that we've finally made peace,

653
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:41,380
why don't we sit down and have a drink,

654
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:43,800
and turn disputes of the past

655
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,060
into jokes we can tell today?

656
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,510
Isn't that interesting?

657
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,710
Besides, aren't you the one

658
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,230
who first raised suspicions about me?

659
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,020
There were several times in the following years,

660
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:58,930
where you tried your best

661
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:00,950
and almost trapped me in a dead-end situation.

662
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,860
If it weren't for the fact that there are people who were in the way,

663
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,120
I'm afraid you won't live to see this day.

664
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,090
I didn't expect that even you as a Young Master would be held back by others,

665
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,560
and be trapped in the mundane rules of ethics.

666
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,750
How can I do something treacherous?

667
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:15,510
You're wrong.

668
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,020
The laws of heaven are supreme.

669
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,710
The Tao and the human nature are second.

670
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,540
Even within a family,

671
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,910
it should also be controlled by the wise and capable members of the family.

672
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:26,300
You're the only one who is enlightened within the Kou family.

673
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,890
Why can't you replace the Master?

674
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,970
Those who want to achieve great things need to be cold-hearted.

675
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,600
You're both virtuous and talented,

676
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,270
but you are still soft-hearted.

677
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:57,860
[Yunhe Realm]

678
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:10,470
Disobeying Prince Fu's order

679
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,010
is as good as violating Yuntai's rules.

680
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,460
If they dare to continue disobeying, take them down.

681
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,060
How dare you talk to me about Yuntai's rules

682
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,630
as an outsider?

683
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:22,290
Mr. Zhong, why are you in such a hurry to leave Yuntai?

684
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,160
Don't tell me you are on your way to report Prince Fu?

685
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,100
So what if I am?

686
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:33,900
What's wrong?

687
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:36,310
Nothing.

688
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:38,600
It's just that some chaos within my sect.

689
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:45,090
Are you interested

690
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:46,620
to go take a look with me?

691
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:58,640
He has betrayed us.

692
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,170
I wonder if Xu Lang can take him down.

693
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,460
It's a pity that my martial arts skills are mediocre.

694
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:08,710
I can only sit back and

695
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:10,270
watch myself give up on this great achievement.

696
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:12,300
What a pity.

697
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,060
It's a rare opportunity

698
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,540
to learn from Yuntai's Yanwu Master.

699
00:44:22,390 --> 00:44:23,710
How can Brother Xu claim this opportunity exclusively for himself?

700
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:28,710
You little brat.

701
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:34,540
This headquarter of Yuntai

702
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,660
is now truly notorious.

703
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:41,310
I'll take over for Mr. Zhong.

704
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:42,720
Leave.

705
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:05,420
Kang Qiao!

706
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:10,960
You don't have to go over.

707
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:14,720
Mr. Zhong is the Yanwu Master of Yuntai.

708
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:16,500
They are not his match.

709
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,240
Master!

710
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:43,050
- Master! 
- Mr. Zhong!

711
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,510
Master!

712
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:47,620
Master!

713
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:50,170
Kang Qiao.

714
00:46:51,930 --> 00:46:53,350
There is poison on the sword.

715
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,290
Master!

716
00:46:58,750 --> 00:47:00,190
Are you also going to disobey the order of Yuntai?

717
00:47:00,950 --> 00:47:03,960
To me, my Master will always come before Yuntai.

718
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,420
Then you don't have to live either.

719
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:07,180
Kang Qiao!

720
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:49,900
Stop!

721
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:55,390
How dare you!

722
00:47:55,670 --> 00:47:57,030
Surrender now!

723
00:47:58,020 --> 00:47:59,750
This is the holy land of Yuntai!

724
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:08,040
Kang...

725
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:10,300
Kang Qiao!

726
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,330
Go! Leave me alone!

727
00:48:27,930 --> 00:48:28,480
Kang Qiao!

728
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:32,980
Kang Qiao!

729
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:36,980
Kang Qiao!

730
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,500
Don't worry.

731
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,560
I'll send you down to accompany him now.

732
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,250
Stop!

733
00:49:11,730 --> 00:49:12,300
Kang Qiao!

734
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:21,340
Kang Qiao!

735
00:49:22,150 --> 00:49:23,800
How could this happen?

736
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:30,060
Give my Yuntai warriors a grand burial.
