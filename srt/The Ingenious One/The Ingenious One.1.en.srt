00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:48,910
We can play again if you don't like it.

191
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,480
You cheated!

192
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,050
I already told you.

193
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,860
Don't get yourself involved.

194
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,650
Not bad.

195
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:25,740
Catch her!

196
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:26,210
Yes.

197
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:47,420
Get her!

Stop!

Stop!

Stop!

00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:16,900
Stop!

205
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:30,290
Go after her!

[Chai’s Pharmacy]

207
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:17,600
Dr Chai.

208
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:21,050
Can I pay for the medicine a few days later?

209
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,500
[Dr. Chai, Yuntai Sect]

210
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,600
100 pence. No credit.

211
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:24,970
It's on me.

212
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:26,370
Take the medicine and leave.

213
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,490
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

214
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:33,340
Doctor,

215
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,090
I'd like to ask for a folk prescription for heatstroke.

216
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,030
It is still early spring,

217
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,250
and you're asking for a prescription for heatstroke?

218
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,080
An extra king will make the country a mess;

219
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:44,940
while spare stuff makes us prepared.

220
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:48,260
I'll feel more secure keeping some medicine at hand.

221
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,160
You're lucky.

222
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:53,020
I happen to have this medicine ready at hand.

223
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,500
Please come with me.

224
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:04,710
I haven't had guests for a long time. It's a bit shabby here.

225
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,280
Please.

226
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:06,220
It's okay.

227
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,730
You've been based in Baiju Town

228
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,400
for more than ten years, right?

229
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,589
I was wondering what brought you here.

230
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,880
Have you heard of a fellow disciple

231
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,020
imprisoned on the salt farm in Baiju Town?

232
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:22,599
Who?

233
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,010
Senior Wen who's in charge of Nandu.

234
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,079
Wen Cong?

235
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,080
I was negligent.

236
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,820
I didn't know about it.

237
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,830
You never see any prisoners out

238
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:40,330
of the dark prison on the salt farm.

239
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:44,240
Besides, it's said that the mining supervisor is extremely violent.

240
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:46,630
The title of the King of Hell is not unfounded.

241
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,030
King of Hell?

242
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,500
He's just a fool and a reckless man.

243
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,340
You can't say that.

244
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,370
They have a batch of soldiers.

245
00:17:55,390 --> 00:17:56,400
I've killed most of them.

246
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,720
Then what did you

247
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,310
look for Wen for?

248
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:05,690
Nothing else.

Keep looking for her today.

Even if that girl is a ghost,

265
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,260
I don't believe she can disappear.

266
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:04,570
Yes.

267
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,210

Who is it?

270
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,170
Yan Luowang colluded with the Water Gang

271
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:28,480
to kidnap and rob the salt merchants.

272
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,420
The government didn't even

273
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,240
notice such a big incident.

274
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:35,120
His official account book was meticulous.

275
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,320
That means there must be another secret account.

276
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,460
I guess the secret account

277
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,140
is hidden in Yan Luowang's house.

278
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,420

It's only been a few days. Why are you here again?

284
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,290
It's not peaceful lately.

285
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:07,460
Master asked me to help you.

286
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,630
Master asked me to remind you

287
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,220
the government's been stricter and stricter on checking illegal salt.

288
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,690
Don't act rashly.

289
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:21,370

No.

Your accounts are getting fewer every month.

305
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:47,270
The salt merchants are also getting shrewder.

306
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,780
They often move in scores or hundreds.

307
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,670
Even if we want to rob them,

308
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:53,620
how can we do it?

309
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,190
You slaughtered the caravan at will.

310
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,680
You've gone too far.

311
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,470
How can salt merchants not unite?

312
00:22:58,470 --> 00:22:59,750
Blood is on my hands,

00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,970
while you, Master Qi, live a relaxing life.

314

Watch your mouth.

315
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,330
If it weren't for the Water Gang,

316
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:09,040
Lord Yan wouldn't be able to be so carefree.

317
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,280
Where is the official account?

318
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,880
I'll put away the secret account.

319
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:32,660
Do keep it safe.

320
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,750
This is for you to check.

321
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,370
Okay, I'll take my leave.

322
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:40,990
Let me see you off.

323
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,910
Since you brought me here,

324
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,960
just say what you want.

325
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:53,630
What are you looking at?

326
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,520
You've been following me.

327
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:57,220
Shouldn't I ask you first?

328
00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:59,830
If it weren't for me,

329
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,340
you would have been killed by Yan Luowang.

330
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,700
Look at the sunset.

331
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:08,540
What some people see is

332
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,590
"The sunset and the lone duck fly together,

333
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,190
and the autumn water reflects the same color as the sky."

334
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,870
But what some other people see is the setting sun with the color of blood.

335
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,760
Who is your friend in the dark prison?

336
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,200
I was so close to you on the beam.

337
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,220
I smelled the perfume of

338
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,390
plum blossom in your sachet.

339
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:36,780
After so many years,

340
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,760
Mr. Wen still likes this kind of perfume.

341
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,030
You know my godfather?

342
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:44,010
Are you also from Yuntai?

343
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,000
Yes, or no.

344
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,910
Are you or are you not?

345
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,720
He saved my life.

346
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:57,420
I heard he's become a cripple in prison.

347
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,100
It's not easy to save him.

348
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,310
But Miss,

349
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,590
if you cooperate with me,

350
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:06,370
I can be 100% sure.

351
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,260
What? You don't trust me?

352
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,080
Or do you have a better choice?

353
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,470
You don't know any martial arts.

354
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,110
How can you join hands with me?

355
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,630
As long as I'm smart, it's enough.

356
00:25:22,690 --> 00:25:24,440
If you go down this post road for 20 miles,

357
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,050
there is a dock.

358
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:27,710
Beside the dock are buried

359
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,850
the official bandits under Yan Luowang.

360
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,500
I killed them all.

361
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:36,540
You're boasting.

362
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,530
You just used others to kill them.

363
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,220
I witnessed the battle at the riverside.

364
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:45,630
If I wasn't sure that you and Yan Luowang were rivals,

365
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,400
why would I have helped you?

366
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,170
I see.

367
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:55,940
You risked your life to steal the secret account.

368
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,540
What's the use of it?

369
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:01,130
If you trust me,

370
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,710
do as I say.

371
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,790
My name is Shu Yanan.

372
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,090
Tell me your name too.

373
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:14,170
Yun Xiang.

374
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,360
Take the account

375
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:26,890
to Yangzhou.

376
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,030
Do everything according to our plan.

377
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:29,800
What about you?

378
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,400
I'm going to meet Wen Cong.

379
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,500
Sir, please come in.

[Hongyun Casino]

381
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:57,860
Lord Yan is having bad luck tonight.

382
00:26:59,160 --> 00:26:59,820
Boy,

383
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,270
why do your dots always outnumber mine by one?

384
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,310
One more is enough to win.

385
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:12,370
You were here last night, right?

386
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,950
You have a good memory, Lord Yan.

387
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,960
But I haven't seen you before.

388
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:22,230
Are you a spy sent by the pirates?

389
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,600
Why? Do I look like a pirate?

390
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,460
Pretty boy,

391
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:32,580
how about we change the rule of the game?

392
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:34,310
How do you want to bet?

393
00:27:34,430 --> 00:27:35,830
Let's bet who has a smaller number of dots,

394
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,880
on all the money you have.

395
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,440
Such a big stake!

396
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:44,760
My lord,

397
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,400
I don't have that much money.

398
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,030
It doesn't matter.

399
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,350
As long as you win,

400
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:52,190
you can take this ingot of gold.

401
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,550
But I have a condition.

402
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:55,880
I'll go first.

403
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,190
What do you think?

404
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:01,470
Okay.

405
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,910
Are you sure?

406
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,820
If we're even, the one who goes first wins.

407
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,400
Okay.

408
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,560
You have some guts.

409
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:36,390
Three. That is the smallest.

410
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:37,320
There's no smaller number.

411
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,680
He's lost for sure.

412
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:39,190
Wait!

413
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:40,700
My lord,

414
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:42,840
you're not leaving room for me.

415
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,050
Cut the crap.

416
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,120
Take the money.

417
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,000
Yes.

418
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:46,900
Wait.

419
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,060
I haven't shaken the dice yet.

420
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,250
Shake then.

I want to see

422
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,540
what you will get.

423
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:57,610
Right?

Yes.

You're playing tricks.

I'm done.

427
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,200
Really?

428
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:46,110
How is that possible?

429
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,270
Lord Yan, I won.

430
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,000
Wait.

431
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,670
Are you going back on your words?

432
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,310
Going back on my words?

433
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,720
Everyone knows

434
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,500
I'm the most reasonable man in Baiju Town.

435
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,520
Am I right?

436
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,060
Yes.

437
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:22,190
It's just that your method is not very smart.

438
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:26,740
It's against the rules.

439
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,110
Yes.

440
00:30:29,210 --> 00:30:30,850
How about this, Lord Yan?

441
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,360
let's make another bet.

442
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:33,310
Still, you go first.

443
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,640
You're sensible enough.

How about this, Lord Yan?

445
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,450
To show fairness,

446
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,390
I want to use your dice.

447
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:03,230
I also want to ask this young man beside you

448
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,490
to shake them for me.

449
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:16,500
Shake them well.

If we draw, the one who goes first wins.

453
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,170
Take the money.

454
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,690
Wait.

You tampered with them.

459
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,860
Lord Yan, you cheated but slander me instead?

460
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,890
Although we're in Baiju Town,

461
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:20,390
we have to play fair.

462
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:20,950
Yes.

463
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:21,560

465

Take him back.

466

Why are you arresting me?

467
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,950
Is there justice?

468
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:42,230
Behave yourself.

469
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:43,550
Let's go.

470
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,790

471
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,350
