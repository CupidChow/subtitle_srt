[Episode 26: Love and Farewell]

4
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:42,340
I...

5
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,460
I-I just left for a few days.

6
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,020
How did you offend Liu Gongquan?

7
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,410
I didn't expect you'd heard of him.

8
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:55,220
You don't say.

9
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,970
Everyone in the martial world knows him.

10
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,510
Rest easy. I didn't provoke him.

11
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,660
I just made a deal with him.

12
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:04,880
Let me make it clear.

13
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,480
I won't go against the government.

14
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:07,740
I understand.

15
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:10,430
Just take good care of your Jishan Hall.

16
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,080
Really?

17
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,450
Then I won't care about anything else.

18
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,600
I prepared a little something for you.

19
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,700
It's now in your room.

20
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:25,890
Why don't you take a look?

21
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:07,890
How's it going?

22
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,430
Have you got things squared away in Jishan Hall?

23
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,690
I'm not in the mood to talk about this.

24
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:15,790
Did Liu Gongquan come here to see you?

25
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:19,070
What was he up to?

26
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,270
Did he give you a hard time?

27
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:24,920
Let's talk inside.

28
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:42,610
Liu Gongquan

29
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,610
knew I was from Yuntai.

30
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,909
The Best Detective in Jiangnan is indeed capable.

31
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,730
But he was so eager to investigate the case

32
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,940
that he played right into my hands.

33
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,060
Don't worry.

34
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:56,420
I've solved the crisis.

35
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,409
You haven't.

36
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,150
Once you help him locate the soldiers' whereabouts,

37
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,100
he can give the order to arrest you anytime.

38
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:04,970
It's all right.

39
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:16,400
I know

40
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,350
something he wants to know.

41
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,590
Forget it.

42
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,100
I don't want you and Ten Taels of Gold to get involved.

43
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,810
I'd better cut it out now.

44
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,290
You're taking a risk

45
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,590
to avenge the murder of your family, right?

46
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:52,340
But have you ever thought that

47
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,460
if you had really gone against Lingyuan that day,

48
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,300
even if you found the person you'd been looking for

49
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,420
and got the answer you'd been searching for,

50
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,890
in the future, you would have opposed

51
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,480
the entire Lingyuan Sect?

52
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,070
So what?

53
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,460
Yun Xiang.

54
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,480
You taught me before

55
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,140
to protect ourselves before taking revenge.

56
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,450
If you take the risk recklessly,

57
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,480
you may lose the chance to revenge forever.

58
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:18,630
I know.

59
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,770
I'm well prepared.

60
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,960
Have you really made up your mind?

61
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,830
You're not the kind of person who rushes headlong into danger.

62
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:53,840
When did you turn back into

63
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:56,580
a secretive person like you used to be,

64
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,460
always hiding something?

65
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,540
I don't know which of your words is true

66
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,530
and which is not.

67
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,930
I don't know what you're planning either.

68
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,040
I've always treated you with a sincere heart.

69
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,290
Don't worry.

70
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,659
I won't be threatened by Liu Gongquan.

71
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,250
Only when I know the whole story can I be reassured.

72
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:04,540
As a matter of fact,

73
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,230
I heard that in Nandu City,

74
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:12,780
there was another force of Lingyuan.

75
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,400
When the time is ripe,

76
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,090
I will hand them over to Liu Gongquan personally.

77
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,580
Another force of Lingyuan?

78
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:29,670
What do you think Lingyuan is?

79
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
Mr. Mo has found out

80
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,720
where the ringleader of Lingyuan is hiding.

81
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,429
He can round them up in one fell swoop.

82
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,760
I capitalized on that to ally with Liu Gongquan.

83
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,850
Do you feel more relieved

84
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:18,840
after knowing these?

85
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,710
Have you forgotten what you said

86
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,880
when I was carrying you on my back?

87
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,530
I said I wouldn't leave

88
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,910
and I'd stay by your side forever.

89
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,620
You said those were drunk words.

90
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,460
Then I said I would always

91
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,010
keep my promises.

92
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,220
I lied to you and said I didn't remember

93
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,420
because...

94
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,090
I understand.

95
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:47,150
That was the only lie

96
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,850
that I was not afraid of being seen through by you.

97
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:57,860
That was also the only time

98
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,800
I was willing to be deceived by you.

99
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:06,760
I'm sorry.

100
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,300
You don't have to.

101
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,020
Yun Xiang.

102
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,180
Where did she go last night?

103
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,540
She boarded a pleasure boat,

104
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:10,460
but even the songstress was sent away.

105
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:12,130
She drank alone until midnight at 1 am.

106
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,140
Who did she meet with?

107
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:15,960
She didn't talk to anyone.

108
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,580
No markings were left along the way either.

109
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,740
I looked into the owner of the pleasure boat.

110
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,550
He had nothing suspicious.

111
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,920
Yun Xiang, what do you think?

112
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,450
You must have figured it out already.

113
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,120
It's more suspicious for not having any doubtful points.

114
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:33,790
Maybe she was checking if she was being watched.

115
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:36,470
Was the shadowman discovered?

116
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:37,290
Not a chance.

117
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:39,420
Once she confirms she is safe,

118
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,160
she will make her next move.

119
00:14:44,390 --> 00:14:44,740
Keep an eye on her.

120
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:45,830
Got it.

121
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:52,890
Tell me.

122
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,530
Why did the young master do such a ridiculous thing?

123
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,900
I dare not speculate on his mind.

124
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,710
You dare not say it, right?

125
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,820
I'll say it for you.

126
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:07,380
The young master seems to be dealing with the Lingyuan Sect's Nandu Branch,

127
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,810
but he actually wants to deal with me.

128
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:12,240
Am I right?

129
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,550
But it's a pity that Mr. Ye

130
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,980
died for me.

131
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,430
Mr. Ye was rounded up by soldiers

132
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,420
and committed suicide by taking poison.

133
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:23,580
That's impossible.

134
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,340
Mind your manners.

135
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:29,160
I received the secret letter just now.

136
00:15:29,950 --> 00:15:31,700
What? Do you want to have a look?

137
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:36,360
[Mr. Ye was rounded up by soldiers and committed suicide by taking poison]

138
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,100
Mr. Nangong,

139
00:15:45,490 --> 00:15:46,890
since the Kou family wants to deal with you,

140
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,840
why don't you rebel against them first?

141
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,450
Don't mention such unfaithful words anymore

142
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,840
in the future.

143
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,610
You must remember that

144
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,730
Mr. Ye

145
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:09,160
and all the heads of bases in Jiangnan, including me,

146
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,850
owe our today's success

147
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:13,400
to Madam Kou.

148
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,520
Does that mean we should do nothing about the death of Mr. Ye?

149
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:21,460
Madam Kou is wise and mighty.

150
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,120
Since someone has a grievance, he will surely redress for them.

151
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,680
Yuan Ye,

152
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,440
do you really want to avenge Mr. Ye?

153
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,550
Take my token to meet with Madam Kou

154
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,190
and report this to her.

155
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:38,380
Remember,

156
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,830
do take care of the sect's reputation.

157
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,730
Don't mention it to others.

158
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,570
I suppose Yuan Ye

159
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:53,310
is going to sign his own death warrant.

160
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,460
Why did you give him the token then?

161
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:58,610
Aren't you afraid of being implicated by him?

162
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,430
Stupid.

163
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,090
Since I had given him the token,

164
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,140
it implied that I was privy to the matter.

165
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,250
I was privy to it, but I didn't meddle in it.

166
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,010
That means I've put up with it.

167
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,640
By doing so, the master will trust me more.

168
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,300
Ye Xiao is somehow your right-hand man.

169
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,460
It's a pity

170
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,339
for him to die in that way.

171
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:26,300
And now,

172
00:17:26,609 --> 00:17:27,740
our businesses in Nandu

173
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,780
are almost all ruined.

174
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,890
Maybe Yun Xiang

175
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,180
has figured out your plan.

176
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,410
It's not a big deal.

177
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:40,330
I want him to win every battle

178
00:17:41,570 --> 00:17:43,450
so that I can trap him easily.

179
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:54,270
Mr. Yun, here we meet again.

180
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,440
Don't look at my uncle.

181
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,800
I came to Nandu to learn how to solve cases from him.

182
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,480
Greetings, Your Highness.

183
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:05,820
Greetings, Lord Liu.

184
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:09,750
This is Qi.

185
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,180
He has been patrolling the river for over 30 years.

186
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,370
He was also involved in the investigation of the Grand Coordinator's case.

187
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:14,740
According to him,

188
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,640
no tracks of carriages and horses were on the shores of the Cao River,

189
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,860
but there were traces of someone walking ashore.

190
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,760
Lord Liu, you didn't bring any guards?

191
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:24,260
With the crowd present,

192
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,780
how can the culprit show the cloven hoof?

193
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,380
Let's go. We shall talk on the way.

194
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,210
It's a bit odd.

195
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,130
You said that the soldiers on the towboat robbed the tributary cloth.

196
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:45,650
What evidence do you have to prove it?

197
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:53,700
Your Highness,

198
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,040
you can think about it.

199
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,450
If you were one of the soldiers

200
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,440
and committed a crime that could result in your beheading,

201
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,870
what would you do next?

202
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,510
I'll die anyway.

203
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:04,600
Of course, I'll run away.

204
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,660
You'll need money to run away.

205
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:09,140
And the tributary cloth was the only valuable thing on the boat.

206
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,160
That's why we found neither the goods

207
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:12,900
nor the people on the boat.

208
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,300
That makes sense.

209
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,660
But I think there is something wrong.

210
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,210
The tributary cloth has the design of the dragon and phoenix on it.

211
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,640
No one would dare to accept it.

212
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,320
How could they trade it for money?

213
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,380
It's not impossible

214
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,930
to sell the cloth.

215
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,520
Do you even have such connections?

216
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:29,560
Of course.

217
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,170
Think carefully before you answer.

218
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,660
Since you have such connections,

219
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,270
you must have been involved in

220
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,100
many killings.

221
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,090
Since I've decided to cooperate with Lord Liu,

222
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,870
I shall go all out and tell you everything I know.

223
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,820
Sir, we found it.

224
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,710
Sir.

225
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:57,740
We found more than ten traces of walking ashore along the river.

226
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,280
This spot stands out the most.

227
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,810
It should be here.

228
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,220
But how did they know?

229
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:08,040
At least dozens of people

230
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,380
are needed to open up a path like this.

231
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,200
Look.

232
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:17,990
There is burnt yellow at the cut of the grass leaf.

233
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,300
It should have been broken for days.

234
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,690
At least four or five days.

235
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:22,320
It matches the day of the incident.

236
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,160
We looked into the trace before.

237
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,810
There is a stream over 300 meters ahead.

238
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,970
No more traces are to be found after that.

239
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,210
They must have used the stream to cover their footprints.

240
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,310
But the footprints are so obvious.

241
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,590
Why didn't you investigate them before?

242
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,530
Your Highness,

243
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:48,200
Magistrate Shao is looking for the whereabouts of the tributary silver.

244
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,070
There is no way for them to

245
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,330
transport the 100,000 taels of tributary silver on foot.

246
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,410
So there is no need to investigate this spot in particular.

247
00:20:57,810 --> 00:20:59,020
Here, smell it.

248
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,160
It should be a greaseproof paper used to wrap the tributary cloth.

249
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,560
But silk has no smell.

250
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:11,300
Silk hasn't, but the dye has.

251
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,920
This is the smell of purple gromwell and alum.

252
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,880
You can tell that by smelling?

253
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,720
I don't even know

254
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,440
what they smell like.

255
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,860
Not only talent is needed to solve cases,

256
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,780
but also accumulated experience.

257
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,750
Keep everything you see and hear in mind.

258
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,570
That's so troublesome.

259
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,320
What?

260
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:33,290
Are you giving up?

261
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:34,460
Of course not.

262
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,440
I will achieve what I want to do.

263
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,710
Your Highness is gifted.

264
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,220
You've also gained a lot recently.

265
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,170
Lord Liu,

266
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:45,520
shall we go back?

267
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:48,150
Mr. Yun, today...

268
00:21:59,540 --> 00:21:59,930
Open up!

269
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,320
I've lost for three days in a row.

270
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,090
Did you cheat in the games?

271
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,410
Exactly.

272
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,690
It indeed makes sense.

273
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,360
One more round.

274
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:11,410
I think so too.

275
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,200
Come with me.

276
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,220
Manager.

277
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,060
Mr. Deng has lost for three days.

278
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:23,220
How about we rebate him 20% of the profit

279
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:24,510
to keep him?

280
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,290
If we give him rebates, what will other customers think?

281
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,220
Inform Head Dealer Wang

282
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,870
to take care of him today

283
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:33,940
and let him win more.

284
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,820
Play some tricks?

285
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:35,610
What else?

286
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:36,630
Yes, miss.

287
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:47,700
Miss Shu.

288
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:15,530
Young Master.

289
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,650
Ye Xiao is now dead.

290
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:20,670
Now we have got rid of Nangong Fang's right-hand man.

291
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,130
Why don't we quit while we're ahead?

292
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,360
Quit?

293
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:28,100
Isn't this a chance to show my capabilities?

294
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:31,790
When the time is ripe, I'll kill Liu Gongquan first

295
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,680
and Yun Xiang next.

296
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,950
With the merit,

297
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:37,730
who else in the sect can compete with me?

298
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,840
Why didn't you use the secret code this time?

299
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,860
Check on the surrounding to see if there is anything unusual.

300
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:34,580
Do be cautious.

301
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,070
What happened?

302
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,270
Leave Nandu immediately

303
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:42,210
and never come back.

304
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,140
What do you mean?

305
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,060
I told you long ago. Why didn't you listen to me?

306
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,220
Yun Xiang and Liu Gongquan

307
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,540
are now targeting you.

308
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,980
Is Yun Xiang a deity?

309
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,250
How could he foretell everything?

310
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,380
It turns out you tried so hard

311
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:10,030
to drive me away.

312
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,330
I'll leave,

313
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,470
but you have to come with me.

314
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,950
Mother also gave me an important task

315
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,110
to take you back.

316
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,600
The situation is still unclear.

317
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:22,850
I can't leave.

318
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,720
Yun Xiang is really cunning.

319
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,450
He must have set you up long ago.

320
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,460
When will you leave if not now?

321
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:36,000
Don't tell me he took your heart away.

322
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,440
How about I help you get it back?

323
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:47,130
Don't you dare lay a finger on him.

324
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:51,500
You assaulted your birth brother for your lover.

325
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,520
You've been good at martial arts since you were young.

326
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:05,340
Even I am no match for you.

327
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,440
Shame on me.

328
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,050
I wonder how good Yun Xiang is at martial arts.

329
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:13,980
I don't believe

330
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,980
you can protect him 24 hours a day.

331
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,870
I'm warning you again.

332
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,230
Don't hurt him, even a little.

333
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,550
Fine, I can leave him alone.

334
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,380
But it depends on you.

335
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,360
If you follow me back,

336
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,870
I may send someone to keep him safe and sound.

337
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,380
But if someone stops me from taking you back,

338
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,910
I must kill him.

339
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:51,930
Tomorrow at 9 a.m.,

340
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,510
we shall meet at Guichuankou Pier.

341
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,860
Shu Yanan has already left.

342
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:10,910
Do we still need to follow her?

343
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,350
Was the woman the one

344
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:16,850
who caused the deaths of our fellows?

345
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:17,980
Yes.

346
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,410
I'll kill her.

347
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,080
There's no rush.

348
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,140
I'll go after Shu Yanan.

349
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,270
You must surround the house.

350
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,090
Understood.

351
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,370
Don't let go of anyone inside.

352
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,610
Also, inform our fellows

353
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,170
not to tell anyone that Shu Yanan came here.

354
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,770
How many years have you been in the Yuntai Sect?

355
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,040
The longer a disciple stays in Yuntai,

356
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,320
the higher his status is.

357
00:27:58,130 --> 00:27:58,480
My Lord.

358
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,430
Please allow me to keep some information for now.

359
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:03,730
Look.

360
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,660
He is indeed cunning.

361
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,390
Do keep your distance from him.

362
00:28:08,910 --> 00:28:10,370
But in terms of cunning,

363
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:11,360
you are not inferior too.

364
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,120
When we arrive at the city gate,

365
00:28:16,590 --> 00:28:17,660
I shall get off there.

366
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:20,280
I'll report to you as soon as I hear anything.

367
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,460
Actually, I'm very curious about

368
00:28:23,650 --> 00:28:25,900
who dares to sell tributary cloth without permission.

369
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,400
How about you take me with you?

370
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:30,500
My Lord, you must have been occupied today.

371
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,570
Rest easy and leave it to me.

372
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,250
If so, take me there. I'm available.

373
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:40,250
I'm just kidding.

374
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,580
I know you won't allow me to go.

375
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,290
Mr. Yun,

376
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,740
we have three deals.

377
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:50,920
I am confident that you can achieve the first deal.

378
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,220
Now we can talk about the second one.

379
00:28:58,130 --> 00:28:58,860
All this time,

380
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,600
Lingyuan has hated Yuntai's tricks the most.

381
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,680
But now, in Nandu City,

382
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,980
they started to imitate Yuntai and intervene in business.

383
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,570
Their cahoots with Tang Xiao are the best proof of this.

384
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,590
This is very different from the previous Lingyuan.

385
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,120
Not only Nandu,

386
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,730
I've handled several major cases.

387
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,780
Merchants are colluding with Lingyuan everywhere.

388
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:23,630
What?

389
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,380
Lingyuan had such an act,

390
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,780
but Yuntai didn't know about it?

391
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,340
What's weird is

392
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,370
they started to steal the treasury and rob the official silver.

393
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,020
And they targeted the official silver twice.

394
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,990
Don't they fear

395
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,300
their flagrant doings

396
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,450
will ruin their business foundation in Nandu City?

397
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:43,060
They only robbed 100,000 taels of official silver.

398
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,550
If the foundation is ruined,

399
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,650
the loss is far more than that.

400
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,180
It does not make sense.

401
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:51,540
So I suspect two Lingyuan forces

402
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,580
are in the city at the moment.

403
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,740
One goes into business and the other values martial arts.

404
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,160
The disagreement between the two

405
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,930
led us to the current situation.

406
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:02,710
If what you said is true,

407
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,900
can you locate the other Lingyuan force

408
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:05,980
hidden in Nandu?

409
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,460
Of course.

410
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:10,030
Uncle,

411
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,100
it's a good deal.

412
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,950
Whether it's a good deal or not depends on what he wants.

413
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,740
I hope Lord Liu

414
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,840
can open up the Tang's Gambling House.

415
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,930
So that I can buy it.

416
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,610
That's all?

417
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:28,350
I think there's something wrong here.

418
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,000
You've indeed improved a lot in your vigilance.

419
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:35,670
Mr. Yun,

420
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,530
Yuntai has always had a grudge against Lingyuan,

421
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,370
but you rarely fight each other.

422
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:43,300
Now you turned the Lingyuan Sect's Nandu Branch upside down

423
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,100
to get only a property?

424
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,420
This is just my second deal with you.

425
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:52,740
Once you know the third one,

426
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:55,830
you will figure out

427
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,400
what I want.

428
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:11,660
Didn't we agree that I won't be involved?

429
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:13,270
Why are you asking me for help now?

430
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:15,910
Do you think everyone in the grey market wants money more than their lives?

431
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,370
How dare they accept the tribute cloth?

432
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,750
Leave the deal with Liu Gongquan to me.

433
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,290
Now you just have to gather the information.

434
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,580
Tell me first.

435
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,290
What are you up to with Kang Qiao?

436
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,730
He transferred all the shadowmen away

437
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,700
and often didn't come home.

438
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,540
I asked him to help me look into another clue.

439
00:31:36,090 --> 00:31:37,620
Don't worry. It's not risky.

440
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,620
What's the clue I can't know?

441
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,540
I didn't mean to hide it.

442
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,590
All I can say is that if things go well,

443
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,330
I'll take over the entire Tang family's business.

444
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,940
But can money solve the problem we're facing now?

445
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:05,130
So the news in the grey market is very crucial now.

446
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,170
If we find the tributary cloth,

447
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,310
we can locate the fleeing soldiers.

448
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:11,310
The deal between Liu Gongquan and me

449
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,530
can then continue.

450
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,090
I'm counting on you.

451
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:16,730
Please.

452
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:27,320
How was it? Who did she visit?

453
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,310
Someone from the Lingyuan Sect.

454
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,110
Are you sure?

455
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,390
I fought that woman from Lingyuan before.

456
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,380
I couldn't be mistaken.

457
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,740
I will keep the secret

458
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,270
about Shu Yanan from the sect.

459
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,400
But I'm afraid you can't hide it from Mr. Mo for long.

460
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:48,040
I understand.

461
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:49,680
Thank you.

462
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:52,790
Yun Xiang,

463
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,600
Mr. Mo and I are not sticklers for stereotypes.

464
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,300
We won't blame you for that.

465
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,380
Shu Yanan really hid it too well.

466
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:01,890
She accompanied you all the way.

467
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,860
It's reasonable for you to break the rules and fall for her.

468
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,140
Don't blame yourself.

469
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:07,690
She didn't hide it well,

470
00:33:09,090 --> 00:33:09,780
but I...

471
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:10,940
It doesn't matter anymore.

472
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,550
No matter what she's up to,

473
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,540
you're still more intelligent than her.

474
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,630
You used her

475
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,400
to locate their hideout.

476
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,910
Either way, she won't bother you anymore.

477
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:25,750
What do you mean?

478
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,220
She must have been wary of you.

479
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,850
After tipping those people off,

480
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:31,280
she disappeared.
