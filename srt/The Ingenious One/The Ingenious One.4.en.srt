00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,350
Hello, Mr. Mo.

11
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,610
I wonder which one you look forward to,

12
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,520
a beauty, or a noble man?

13
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,210
A noble man is dull, and a beauty is distractive.

14
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:49,470
I want neither of them.

15
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,280
I didn't expect you, Master's last disciple

17
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,180
would be so young and handsome.

19
00:02:58,329 --> 00:02:59,520

As soon as you came to town,

31
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,720
You came to Nandu

32
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,090
for these, right?

33
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,030
You're indeed very resourceful, Mr. Mo.

34
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,840
I suppose it would be against the rules

35
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,510
for me to take away these ledgers.

36
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:48,470
Of course.

Don't worry, chum.

It's OK.

40
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,780
I developed a photographic memory

41
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,040
a long time ago at Yuntai.

Of what happened to Mr. Wen...

43
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,440
Are you aware?

00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,850
Nourishing a viper in his bosom

45
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,900
was exactly what Wen Cong had been doing.

46
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,570
Was there anyone behind Qi Tianfeng?

47
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,860
Have you ever wondered

48
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,270
why I was not involved

49
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,000
in this Wen Cong incident?

50
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,340

Confidentiality is of top priority for Yuntai.

54
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,520
I never asked about his affairs.

55
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,550
And he never asked about mine.

56
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,480
No wonder this tragedy happened to Mr. Wen.

57
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:53,170
Resourceful though you are, Mr. Mo,

58
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,360
you were not at all alert to it.

59

Now I see.

60
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,560
I suppose these old accounts of Mr. Wen's

61
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,820
do need some looking into.

you'll show me a receipt and claim that

97

98
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:33,750

00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:08,910
Take care of yourself.

374
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,110
Mr. Su.

375
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,340
-Join us... -What are you doing here?

376
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,510
Jin.

377
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:27,790
Did you sleep well last night?

378
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:30,200
Miss Shu.

379
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,500
Miss Shu looks different today.

380
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,050
Looks strange, doesn't she?

381
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,520
Shut up!

382
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,050
You all get obsessed with Ke Menglan

383
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:38,780
when you see her,

384
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:39,700
and I can't dress like this?

385
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,640
Come on, have a seat.

386
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:42,590
OK.

387
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,210
Why?

388
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,450
I'm not obsessed.

389
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,740
Fellow Nandu merchants,

390
00:27:02,090 --> 00:27:02,750
I hope you're well.

391
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,770
I'm honored to have been appointed by Chairman Su

392
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,190
to be the host of the auction today.

393
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,260
I'm sure you are eager to see the lots,

394
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,050
so I won't go on.

395
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,810
Let's get started then.

396
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,260
Yeah, let's get started.

397
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,510
Please bear with me, Mr. Tang.

398
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,160
We still need to spell out the rules.

399
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:30,150
As this is an auction,

400
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,640
when the gong sounds, the highest bidder gets the lot.

401
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,900
So please follow the way we do business

402
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:37,480
and let fate decide.

403
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:42,770
Miss.

404
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,510
Tomorrow,

405
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,920
the world outside will be the same,

406
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,220
but the future of Liansheng House is uncertain.

407
00:27:56,980 --> 00:28:00,120
If it falls into the hands of Mr. Tang...

408
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,650
I met many like Tang Xiao

409
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,390
when I was in the brothel.

410
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,370
Miss,

411
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,640
there is an army of wealthy young men

412
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,960
who want to marry you.

413
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,740
If you can marry one that's somewhat to your liking,

414
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:11,970
it'd be better than being bullied by Tang Xiao.

415
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,340
We're of the low and degenerate lot.

416
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,040
It will always be a hard life.

417
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,720
Besides, the imperial government decreed that

418
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:27,060
this status must be kept for generations,

419
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,090
and we're not allowed to marry a commoner,

420
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,270
not even as a concubine,

421
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,510
but can only be slaves.

422
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,310
But Mr. Su does seem to be infatuated with you.

423
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,110
The third lot is Liansheng House.

424
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,280
We're starting at 1,200 taels of silver.

425
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,430
Please start bidding.

426
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:56,950
Thirteen hundred taels.

427
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:00,570
Thirteen hundred taels, by Table A2.

428
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,770
Fourteen hundred taels.

429
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,120
Sit down.

430
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,270
-Fourteen hundred taels, by Table C1. -Two thousand taels!

431
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,800
Two thousand taels, by Table A2.

432
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,070
If you're here for Liansheng House,

433
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:29,900
why aren't you bidding?

434
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,460
Do remember

435
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,250
to do the unexpected

436
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:38,870
and wait for the right time.

437
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,780
Two thousand taels, second time.

438
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,690
Three thousand taels.

439
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:59,980
Three thousand taels, by Table B2.

440
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,360
Mr. Qian,

441
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,940
the Su family is a respectable and wealthy family.

442
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,940
Since when are you so interested in these

443
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:09,860
niche businesses

444
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,160
with little profit?

445
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,900
Or are you trying to drive up the price?

446
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,410
Three thousand five hundred taels.

447
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:22,960
Mr. Tang,

448
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,180
please speak with caution.

449
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,800
Three thousand five hundred taels, by Table A2.

450
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,820
Three thousand five hundred taels, second time.

451
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,450
Can you lend me 1,000 taels?

452
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:58,040
I'll pay you back with interest within half a month.

453
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,040
Normally the interest rate is 3%.

454
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,710
For you, Mr. Su, I'll make it 1%.

455
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,100
Deal.

456
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:09,910
Four thousand taels.

457
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,310
Four thousand taels?

458
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:19,920
Have you really got 1,000 taels?

459
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,780
Four thousand taels, by Table B2.

460
00:31:27,770 --> 00:31:29,140
Liansheng House

461
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,700
is worth no more than 3,000 taels

462
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:34,260
so far as market price goes,

463
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,000
right?

464
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,350
Mr. Su,

465
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:40,280
got a deep affection for it, eh?

466
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:52,780
Mr. Su is fond of it.

467
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,020
So am I.

468
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,700
What a coincidence!

469
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,890
Four thousand five hundred taels.

470
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:25,850
What are you waiting for?

471
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,160
Table A2

472
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,390
bids 4,500 taels.

473
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,770
Mr. Su,

474
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,460
if you want Liansheng House so much,

475
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,030
I could make an investment.

476
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,500
We can bid for it together.

477
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,020
OK.

478
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:49,420
Mr. Su bids 6,000 taels.

479
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,270
Six thousand taels, by Table B2.

480
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,500
Six thousand taels, second time.

481
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:39,460
Six thousand taels, third time.

482
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,880
May I know your name?

483
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,200
Why haven't I seen you before?

484
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:05,720
I'm Yun Xiang.

485
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:07,380
I'm new here.

486
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,900
Yun Xiang?

487
00:34:33,670 --> 00:34:34,350
Nice to meet you.

488
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:36,870
This is Nandu.

489
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,590
I'm Tang Xiao.

490
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:58,800
There's someone over there!

491
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,640
Take Zhang Kui away now.

492
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:23,390
Give him a proper burial.

493
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,130
-OK. -OK.

494
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,320
You only found out a name?

495
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,380
There's nothing else?

496
00:35:30,170 --> 00:35:31,090
Zhang Kui said that

497
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:33,220
although Yun Xiang was highly skilled in martial arts,

498
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,370
he had never demonstrated it.

499
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,350
When the news came yesterday

500
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:38,920
saying he was alone,

501
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,790
Kui immediately gathered the men.

502
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,070
Little did he know that it was Yun Xiang's trap.

503
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:46,730
The whole dozen men of ours just vanished.

504
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:49,690
Even if Yun Xiang had killed them all on his own,

505
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,890
he wouldn't have been able to clean it up so fast.

506
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,680
Yuntai probably has other supporters in Nandu.

507
00:35:56,470 --> 00:35:57,950
Go prepare a banknote of 5,000 taels of silver

508
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:00,010
and bring it to the Tangs' Gambling House.

509
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:01,400
Master,

510
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,840
we gave them 3,000 taels of silver at most in previous years.

511
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,380
The extra 2,000 taels...

512
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,930
It's half a month's worth of our profit.

513
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,360
It's been decades.

514
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:18,520
I've had enough of relying on others.

515
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,200
That's the reason

516
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,830
we had to get rid of Wen Cong.
