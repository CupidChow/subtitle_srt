[Episode 36: As If We Meet Again]

4
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,090
Nandu reported that

5
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,150
Su’s over 20 storehouses

6
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,100
were burned to the ground.

7
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,030
The arsonist was Su Mingyu.

8
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,259
He has escaped.

9
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,530
He is now a wanted man.

10
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,380
Causing huge damage to oneself while trying to take down one's enemy.

11
00:01:54,789 --> 00:01:56,710
That's what Yuntai normally does.

12
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,110
Su Mingyu has a good master.

13
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:00,520
Not only Nandu,

14
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:02,500
all military supplies in neighboring provinces

15
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,260
have been bought out.

16
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:07,180
We can only go to the rural north to look for supplies.

17
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,479
Go make the deployment.

18
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:09,430
Yes.

19
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:11,310
Your Highness.

20
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:13,750
Your Highness.

21
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,060
I just received the news

22
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,090
that Master Kou has been killed

23
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:17,710
by Yun Xiang and Kou Lianyi.

24
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,220
Also,

25
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,060
Lord Nangong's tomb is empty.

26
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:22,760
It's suspected that he's faking his death.

27
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,030
Young Yun Xiang and Kou Lianyi have brought him down the mountain.

28
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,030
Where are they now?

29
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,490
We haven't found them yet.

30
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,510
Keep investigating.

31
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:34,640
Yes.

32
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:40,680
The mastermind of Yuntai is brilliant.

33
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,570
In the end,

34
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,880
the disciple laid out traps for their master instead.

35
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,100
Fine.

36
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,000
The direct disciple.

37
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,740
They match each other.

38
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,890
I wonder if this is good or bad.

39
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,500
Yun Xiang is naturally gifted.

40
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,050
But I don't understand

41
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,670
why he would abduct Nangong Fang.

42
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,220
They have a deep grudge.

43
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:17,790
He has been hiding his identity for more than ten years

44
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,530
to seek revenge.

45
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,420
But if he wants revenge,

46
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,810
he can just kill Nangong Fang.

47
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,120
Why did he kidnap him?

48
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,010
Where is Kou Lianyi?

49
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:04,740
Give her to me.

50
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,100
I'll tell you everything you ask.

51
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,220
You harassed Miss Kou first.

52
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,380
You brought this upon yourself.

53
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,019
What you should think about now

54
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,820
is how to save your own life.

55
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,240
Prince Fu's plan to use Lingyuan's chaos

56
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:25,010
has been disintegrated.

57
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,470
After the incident,

58
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,140
Prince Fu was planning to take Nandu.

59
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,180
But he couldn't do it.

60
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,790
The garrison supplies in the city

61
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,250
have been burned down.

62
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,600
Nandu now is but an empty town.

63
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:43,310
The only people Prince Fu can rely on now

64
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,780
are the pirates.

65
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,900
You've been in contact with Master Guan, right?

66
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,430
Is this why you and Kou Lianyi

67
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,659
went through so much to kidnap me here?

68
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,360
Stop mentioning Miss Kou.

69
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:02,130
Nangong Fang,

70
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,640
if you tell us the plan of the bandits,

71
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,760
the imperial court will be lenient to you.

72
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,350
If I tell you,

73
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,030
how can I survive?

74
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,380
Why don't you let me go?

75
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,390
When I see Master Guan,

76
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,240
I could persuade him to retreat.

77
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,070
Isn't my state right now

78
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,220
what you want to see anyway?

79
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:36,610
My lord.

80
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,920
Tell him.

81
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:41,909
Yes.

82
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,060
Eunuch Liu just returned from the coastal defense.

83
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:47,320
The bandits tried to attack the wharf the night before.

84
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:49,170
Fortunately, the coastal defense had taken precautions.

85
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:50,990
The bandits retreated without fighting.

86
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:53,620
It means it's useless to keep him alive.

87
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:57,930
If this is true,

88
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:00,850
just kill me.

89
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,060
You've solved the urgent matter.

90
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:19,540
It's all thanks to Your Majesty's timely dispatch.

91
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,610
At this critical period,

92
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,760
I hope you won't just report the good news and not the bad.

93
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,100
Don't be rude in front of Her Highness.

94
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,560
Just speak your mind.

95
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,570
The bandits retreated without a fight.

96
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,310
There must be a conspiracy behind it.

97
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:34,780
Young Master Xiang,

98
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:36,340
please don't hold back what you say.

99
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,659
Your Highness,

100
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:40,430
since the bandits are working with Fu Fan,

101
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,350
they must be ready to risk their lives.

102
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,700
They won't give up without even trying.

103
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,510
It is said that the bandits

104
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,180
have gathered at Guiyu Island.

105
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,400
How many warships are there?

106
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,210
There are over

107
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:57,420
500 warships.

108
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,670
His Majesty is ill.

109
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,980
The situation in the court is already unstable.

110
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,220
In addition to that, the north border is in chaos.

111
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:10,690
The elites of the North leaving town.

112
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,950
If the bandits go on to stir up the south...

113
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,010
How can Fu Fan be so vicious?

114
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,210
With a situation like this,

115
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,990
I haven't been able to sleep in days.

116
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,570
Do you have any good ideas?

117
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:33,760
I'm injured.

118
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,950
I can't kneel and bow.

119
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:37,900
Please forgive me, Your Highness.

120
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,220
No need.

121
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:42,659
Aren't you going to thank Her Majesty?

122
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:46,630
I heard that you failed to attack Master Guan at night

123
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,180
and has retreated.

124
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,450
In that case,

125
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,220
why did you come here?

126
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,140
Although the night raid failed,

127
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,340
the pirate ship

128
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,820
is still far better than the Navy in the southeast.

129
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:01,170
If they attack us,

130
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:03,030
the result is still uncertain.

131
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,140
But if the government deploys the Navy from the north to cause chaos,

132
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:11,150
the bandits will take advantage of the chance to go north to take the Beidu.

133
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:13,220
Is that right?

134
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,780
Yun Xiang knows me well.

135
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:22,620
Yun Xiang said that you must have a backup plan.

136
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:26,530
Perhaps you're the only one who can stop the bandits from attacking.

137
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,740
Although you are a criminal,

138
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,820
but if you make such a great contribution,

139
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,100
I'll guarantee you a promotion

140
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,690
and be rich for hundreds of years.

141
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,150
Be rich for hundreds of years?

142
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,410
I have to see what would happen in this chaotic world.

143
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,750
How dare you!

144
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:48,290
You...

145
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,820
Now I'm a cripple.

146
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,120
I have no offspring.

147
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:59,110
What is hundreds of years to me?

148
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,750
Then let me hear your thoughts.

149
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,170
It's simple.

150
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,850
Give me a speedboat.

151
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,010
I'll meet Master Guan

152
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,920
and persuade him to retreat.

153
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,340
No way.

154
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,510
If we let you leave now,

155
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,930
with your mouth,

156
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,280
who knows what you'd say when the time comes?

157
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,270
Either let me go,

158
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,400
or kill me.

159
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,550
Yun Xiang is here.

160
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,070
Your Highness.

161
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:32,740
Your Highness, don't trust him.

162
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,980
At this point, why not give it a try?

163
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,410
I could have tried.

164
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:38,900
However,

165
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,650
you didn't listen to my advice

166
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,060
and lowered yourself to come here.

167
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,380
This can't be tried anymore.

168
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,670
I lowered myself

169
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,790
to save the people.

170
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,220
Your Highness just revealed

171
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,080
your feelings.

172
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,860
If we let him go to see Master Guan,

173
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,060
it will only make the bandits come faster and become more ruthless.

174
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:09,320
You may leave.

175
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:10,860
Your Highness.

176
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,740
I asked if you have any good ideas, and you couldn't reply.

177
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,730
Yet you're pointing fingers at what I want to do.

178
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,300
You keep saying you care about the people.

179
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,580
But you don't want to let him go.

180
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,020
I'm afraid it's for your personal grudge.

181
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,900
I didn't expect Your Highness to think of me so lowly.

182
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,290
Eunuch Liu.

183
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,230
Yes, Your Majesty.

184
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,380
I'm afraid Young Master didn't understand me.

185
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,020
Yun Xiang.

186
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,000
You should leave now.

187
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:43,620
Don't make Her Highness angry again.

188
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,140
Her Highness said...

189
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,050
Yun Xiang wouldn't let me go because of his personal grudge.

190
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,730
But after thinking about it,

191
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:09,150
I don't know since when I have a deep grudge with him.

192
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,100
Are you really willing to persuade the bandits to retreat?

193
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,100
Your Highness.

194
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,150
What do you mean

195
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,040
by the personal grudge Yun Xiang has?

196
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,880
How do you think

197
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,220
I will persuade Master Guan when I see him this time?

198
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,300
Actually, I didn't expect this at all.

199
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,300
When I saw you for a few times previously,

200
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,860
it did seem like you were hiding something under your eyes.

201
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,680
So your surname is Luo?

202
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,070
I will take your life sooner or later.

203
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:24,390
Now I've escaped again.

204
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,920
We don't know who will take

205
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,960
whose life in the future.

206
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:52,680
Let's go.

207
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:11,880
I didn't expect

208
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:15,270
we could persuade Her Highness to put on an act together

209
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,700
and let Nangong Fang go?

210
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,440
We can only take the risk now.

211
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,860
If you're wrong,

212
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,930
and he really instigates Master Guan to attack,

213
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,280
what would you do?

214
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,800
You still don't trust me.

215
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,030
I don't like gambling.

216
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,580
Neither do I.

217
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,620
But I like winning.

218
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,730
But after he leaves this time round,

219
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:42,000
I'm afraid you won't have a chance to revenge anymore.

220
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,020
Can you people from Yuntai

221
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,200
really hide their grudges?

222
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,100
I'm not hiding it. I'm letting it go.

223
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:58,460
Killing Nangong Fang

224
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:01,220
can help me get over my own personal grudge.

225
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,560
But leaving Nangong Fang

226
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,500
and letting him play a game of chess with me

227
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,940
can help save the lives of the people.

228
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,020
Isn't it more worth it?

229
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:34,540
[Shao’s Residence]

230
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,580
How much provisions do we have?

231
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:38,890
Not even enough for half a month.

232
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,260
Take him away and behead him.

233
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,880
Spare my life, Your Highness!

234
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,220
Spare my life, Your Highness.

235
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,680
As you expected,

236
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,460
Kou Lianyi disbanded all branches.

237
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,950
Any news from Nangong Fang?

238
00:14:56,470 --> 00:14:57,180
No.

239
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:14,690
It's another victory within risks.

240
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:16,550
We actually turned the tide.

241
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,340
Yet I have no idea anymore.

242
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:28,620
Your Highness.

243
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:32,890
Turning the tide?

244
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,700
Yun Xiang took Nangong Fang who pretended to be dead.

245
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,940
He must have figured out my next move.

246
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,340
Take money to see Master Guan.

247
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:53,980
We can't let this rascal have any chance.

248
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,740
The alliance

249
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,950
can't be taken lightly.

250
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,500
I heard that these were sent

251
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,810
by Prince Fu from Yangzhou.

252
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,330
Is this a rebellion?

253
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:07,060
Exactly.

254
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:08,220
It's been less than half a month,

255
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:09,940
and Nandu has completely changed.

256
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,410
The city gate is closed too.

257
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,200
We can't escape even if we want to.

258
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,060
Come out.

259
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,180
Your Highness, please forgive me.

260
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:27,500
I've been following orders.

261
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,100
But at this critical moment,

262
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,210
why did Your Highness come out alone?

263
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,410
If I don't do this, how can I lure you out?

264
00:16:48,990 --> 00:16:50,370
Nandu is not safe now.

265
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:55,390
Please don't go out alone.

266
00:16:57,150 --> 00:16:58,150
What are you afraid of?

267
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:08,460
Actually, it's... It's me.

268
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:08,980
Mingzhu.

269
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,660
From now on, you shall stay here.

270
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,349
I can ensure your safety.

271
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:17,829
Uncle,

272
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,290
I've never begged you.

273
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:22,540
Have you ever cared about my father?

274
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,569
Can you let my father go?

275
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:30,740
Even if it's not for my father,

276
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:33,230
but for me?

277
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:35,850
I can't do as you say.

278
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,810
His Highness is on his way to hell.

279
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,860
I can only protect you

280
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,080
if you stay here.

281
00:17:58,970 --> 00:17:59,380
Let go.

282
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,030
Let go!

283
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,210
- Let go!
- I used to obey you.

284
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:09,960
But today, I can't let you be willful anymore.

285
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,230
You've never treated me like this before.

286
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,030
Do you know what it means to go back?

287
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,570
I can't persuade His Highness.

288
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,170
I can't watch you

289
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,980
walk to the end of the day too.

290
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,770
Are you really going to be so cruel to my father?

291
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:36,010
Don't you care about kinship at all?

292
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,290
His Highness treated me so well.

293
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,000
How can I bear to do that?

294
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:03,460
But this matter concerns the people.

295
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,460
Yet His Highness...

296
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:10,850
is indeed in the wrong.

297
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,900
Did the people take you in?

298
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,580
Have the people ever treated you well?

299
00:19:20,270 --> 00:19:22,590
I trusted you so much since childhood.

300
00:19:23,850 --> 00:19:25,780
I thought you'd hurt anyone but me.

301
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:29,220
I'm not letting you leave today

302
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,210
is to protect you.

303
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,090
Your Highness!

304
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:45,830
I won't blame you if you refuse.

305
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,030
But I will never let my father be alone.

306
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,520
Whether I'm alive or dead,

307
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,600
I want to be with my father.

308
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,620
Just think that

309
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,480
I've never been here before.

310
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,270
The pursuers came so fast.

311
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,000
We have nowhere to run.

312
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,670
I don't want to drag you down anymore.

313
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,080
Zhushan Street should be safe.

314
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,300
It's right ahead.

315
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,220
I can't take it anymore.

316
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:42,990
Where do you think you're going?

317
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,800
You go first. I'll handle this.

318
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:49,070
Mingyu!

319
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:50,280
Run!

320
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,410
Go!

321
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:14,550
Stop!

322
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:19,880
Stop!

323
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:22,130
Stop!

324
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,460
Stop!

325
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,220
Stop!

326
00:21:27,850 --> 00:21:28,330
Stop!

327
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:32,410
Menglan!

328
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,040
Who dares to hurt my brother?

329
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:14,880
Brother Jin!

330
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,240
Brother Jin.

331
00:23:02,170 --> 00:23:02,920
The antidote works.

332
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,670
It's 90% healed.

333
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,930
Tell me, what do you want me to do this time?

334
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,980
Just follow the instructions on the satchet.

335
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,220
You're still alive.

336
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,750
Do you dare to take me in?

337
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,270
These are my swordsmen.

338
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,740
I heard that someone is picking a fight with the owner of Jishan Hall.

339
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:24,220
So I came without any further ado.

340
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,540
Please take her away first.

341
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:34,730
Be careful.

342
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:35,580
Go!

343
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:39,380
Kill them all! Go!

344
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:08,790
Be careful.

345
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:49,410
Mo Bufan has been killed by Prince Fu.

346
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,730
Yet you still work for him?

347
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,080
Uncle Qian?

348
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:37,940
Sir.

349
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:39,370
It's solved.

350
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,190
Sir.

351
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,390
Uncle Qian, why are you here?

352
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:49,140
Of course it's your master, Mr. Yun's idea.

353
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,110
Mingyu.

354
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,070
Isn't this your residence's steward?

355
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,130
By the way,

356
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:57,710
I killed people this time.

357
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,220
You sister will definitely scold me.

358
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,680
So please put in a good word for me when you go back.

359
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,060
Don't worry.

360
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:08,170
Where's Yun Xiang?

361
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:11,240
[Shao's Residence]

362
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,060
I want to see Prince Fu.

363
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,840
You came alone thinking you'd win?

364
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:26,550
You have a clear mind.

365
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,460
You have your own judgment.

366
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,900
Do you remember last time you asked me

367
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,730
what I would do next?

368
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,500
I said I don't know.

369
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,220
The so-called killing move

370
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,700
is your only bet now.

371
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,420
The pirates.

372
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,280
You didn't waste

373
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,400
the 15 years I've taught you for.

374
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,450
I will never forget the things you've taught me.

375
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:05,520
But those pirates may not come.

376
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,160
Let’s go. Master has been waiting for you.

377
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:41,640
Please.

378
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:02,380
At this time, even if Xu Lang brings an entire ship of treasures

379
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,410
to meet Master Guan,

380
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,820
it won't help.

381
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,680
It's just that Nangong Fang will meet Master Guan first.

382
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:13,780
Come.

383
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,080
Master Guan.

384
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,660
Xu Lang?

385
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:23,680
Have a seat.

386
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,260
You're so generous, Your Highness.

387
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,950
Can you persuade him

388
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,450
to make Master Guan not deploy his men?

389
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,820
You are the master of Yuntai.

390
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,220
You should know that

391
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,100
what Nangong Fang will first do

392
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:40,080
after meeting Master Guan.

393
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,720
Since Nangong Fang is with Master Guan,

394
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,660
according to our agreement,

395
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,100
he'd persuade him to deploy troops.

396
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,320
I came in a hurry.

397
00:28:52,710 --> 00:28:54,190
I brought three ships of gold and silver.

398
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,640
The gifts that Prince Fu prepared for you are still in the back.

399
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:57,670
Master Guan.

400
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,720
I saw the warships were assembled on my way here.

401
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,690
But why are they all anchored at the port?

402
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,500
His Highness has taken over Yangzhou

403
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,570
and Nandu, these two cities.

404
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,570
As long as you give the order,

405
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,980
we can shift the power to us.

406
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:11,300
But the moment the power has been reshuffled,

407
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,940
the first person I want to see is Young Master Xiang.

408
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,400
What's the use of meeting him?

409
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,320
Can you bring back what's gone?

410
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,600
As long as you give an order,

411
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,380
Mr. Nangong can take revenge.

412
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,660
After you take over the country,

413
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,210
Master Guan and Prince Fu can divide the north and south among yourselves.

414
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,680
There's no rush.

415
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,350
Let me think about it.

416
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,820
Didn't you have a deal with His Highness?

417
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,480
This isn't a one-sided deal by him!

418
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:37,270
He wanted me to dispatch hundreds of ships

419
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,780
just for a few chests of gems?

420
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,870
How can there be such a cheap deal?

421
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:47,550
Let's talk inside.

422
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,460
Master Guan.

423
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,150
Who is this Xu Lang?

424
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,350
He is Prince Fu's personal guard

425
00:29:57,620 --> 00:29:58,670
and right-hand man.

426
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,190
Is he a man of his word?

427
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:04,300
How many bargaining chips

428
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,140
can I get with what you taught me?

429
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:08,620
Prince Fu and him are the ones in a hurry.

430
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,260
You can ask for the price at will.

431
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:15,500
But in my opinion,

432
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,830
this is not that simple.

433
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:20,260
What do you mean?

434
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,530
After careful consideration, I found something amiss.

435
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,220
First,

436
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,220
I have a grudge against Yun Xiang.

437
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,280
With his rigorous personality,

438
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,000
it doesn't make sense that he'd let go of his hatred

439
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,640
and send me across the sea.

440
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:38,660
Second,

441
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,940
the southwest coastal defense has always been fictional.

442
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,820
If anyone were to attack,

443
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:46,070
the guards will be defeated.

444
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,370
How could Yun Xiang not know about this?

445
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,080
He must have predicted that...

446
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,710
even if he killed me,

447
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,540
you may not send troops.

448
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,660
But he just had to let me go.

449
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:04,220
As we agreed,

450
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:05,630
it's not difficult

451
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,380
to persuade him to send troops.

452
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,940
Besides, it's beneficial to him.

453
00:31:14,130 --> 00:31:14,900
That's right.

454
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,950
So before Nangong Fang was released to cross the sea,

455
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:21,860
I begged Her Majesty to put on a show with me.

456
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,720
If we want to be even more sure about this,

457
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,780
we need Your Highness to follow our plan.

458
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,200
Could we?

459
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,860
Since you two have made up your mind,

460
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,300
I believe you.

461
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,590
Nangong Fang volunteered

462
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,040
to ask the bandits to retreat.

463
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,320
I have a blood feud with him.

464
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:42,920
I can't let him go.

465
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:44,740
But I didn't expect Her Majesty

466
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:45,900
to not listen to my advice

467
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,380
and insisted on letting Nangong Fang go across the sea.

468
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:51,220
It's reasonable.

469
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,670
But too reasonable.

470
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,930
For someone as skeptical as Nangong Fang,

471
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:59,580
I'm sure he'll think there's something fishy about this.

472
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,000
Yun Xiang really thinks highly of himself.

473
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,980
Actually, his acting with the Empress

474
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,280
was so fake.

475
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:08,120
He really thought I couldn't see through it?

476
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,380
He let me cross the sea for only one purpose.

477
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,830
It is for me to persuade you to send your troops as support

478
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,210
in the name of revenge.

479
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:22,690
What?

480
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:25,270
He wants to lure me out instead?

481
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:26,270
That's right.

482
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,740
He must have joined forces with the court

483
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,040
and is fully prepared.

484
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,290
Once you dispatch the troops,

485
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:35,060
he will capture the both of us.

486
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:39,010
In that case, Yun Xiang's want to make me to deploy my troops

487
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:41,970
is a trap that he has set for me to step into?

488
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:44,510
And now Xu Lang is here

489
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,590
to get me killed?

490
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,670
Why should I believe you?

491
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,890
Actually, it's simple.

492
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,180
Because only I

493
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:07,020
want you to win.

494
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,650
Only if you win,

495
00:33:09,890 --> 00:33:10,890
can I take revenge.

496
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:14,210
Lord Fu only worries about himself.

497
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,170
In his eyes, your pirates

498
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,500
are of no difference with the dead soldiers at Lingyuan.

499
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,210
Even if he has the throne,

500
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:24,950
it's still his.

501
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,040
It's none of your business.

502
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:34,630
I tried every means to keep Nangong Fang alive

503
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,740
because I was afraid that if he really died,

504
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,140
you'll be the one who meets Master Guan.

505
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:41,770
What would you do?

506
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:43,870
Entice him with great interests again?

507
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,510
What would Master Guan choose?

508
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:46,810
No one knows.

509
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,450
So in order to get those pirates to retreat,

510
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:53,440
Nangong Fang is the only move we can make.

511
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:00,880
When I was shut in,

512
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,640
I thought I was testing you.

513
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,280
I didn't expect you to set me up.

514
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:14,929
Then Nangong Fang would think

515
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,650
I deliberately used him to lure the pirates to send troops

516
00:34:19,350 --> 00:34:20,870
while the court is waiting for him with assembled troops,

517
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:22,820
that I am trying to capture all of them in one go.

518
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:25,730
What do you think

519
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:28,130
of my acting?

520
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,860
The empty city plan?

521
00:34:33,330 --> 00:34:35,570
But Nangong Fang may not be a Sima Yi.

522
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,610
In terms of practice, you and him are neck and neck.

523
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:41,380
Your trap in a trap, the empty city trap,

524
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:44,290
how can you be sure that Nangong Fang can't see through it?

525
00:34:45,370 --> 00:34:46,639
It doesn't matter

526
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,100
if he can see through it.

527
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:50,480
Why don't you ask Sima Yi?

528
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,409
If he can go back in time,

529
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,350
give him another 100 chances to lead the army to attack the city,

530
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,750
will he have the courage to do so?

531
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,570
Humanity and a human heart,

532
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:04,990
in troubled times,

533
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,790
there are only worries.

534
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:11,890
You taught me that.

535
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,040
It’s said that Zhuge had so many tricks up his sleeves he's basically a demon.

536
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,450
You're worse than that.

537
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,680
You've become a demon.

538
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,120
Master Guan.

539
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,500
When will you give the order?

540
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,500
So I can explain to His Highness.

541
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:49,790
Now.

542
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,280
Arrest him.

543
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:51,610
Yes.

544
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,200
Master Guan, what do you mean?

545
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:55,580
Take him away.

546
00:35:57,230 --> 00:35:58,990
Master Guan! Master Guan!

547
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:00,690
Let go!

548
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,690
There's a long way to go.

549
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:04,990
With you as my counsellor,

550
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,580
we can just find another chance.

551
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:15,140
What should we do with him then?

552
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,210
The thief never leaves empty.

553
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,650
I made a deal with the government

554
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,820
for several islands.

555
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:25,940
Yun Xiang.

556
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,640
You could have helped me

557
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,490
and achieved great cause.

558
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,460
But why did you break your promise?

559
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:39,260
I just want to reshuffle the power

560
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,080
and bring peace to the world.

561
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,700
But you're the one who ruined my effort.

562
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:48,420
You're my most trusted disciple.

563
00:36:49,850 --> 00:36:50,740
In the way of Yuntai,

564
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:52,410
one house is akin to the world,

565
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,380
and one person is akin to the entire population.

566
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,500
But I want to ask

567
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,980
have you ever pitied the people?

568
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:09,070
I'm not the one who betrayed you.

569
00:37:12,630 --> 00:37:16,650
Now you want to unify the world, is just pure daydreaming.

570
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:20,560
With the disbandment of Lingyuan and the pirates breaking the contract,

571
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,820
Nandu has already become an isolated city.

572
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:29,190
The provisions in the city can barely hold out for half a month.

573
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:32,200
How can you continue?

574
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:38,780
Since we are master and disciple,

575
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:42,510
let's leave some dignity for each other.

576
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,550
Forget it.

577
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,100
I admit defeat.

578
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,030
But I have one condition.

579
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:13,840
Otherwise, I'll risk my life.

580
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:17,110
I'll do anything even if I have to risk everything I have.

581
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:29,640
How is it?

582
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,350
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

583
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,280
Congratulations to the people of Nandu.

584
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:49,420
It's so quiet.

585
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,920
Do you blame me?

586
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:55,680
I just thought of my mother.

587
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,370
After she left,

588
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,140
we all went to Yangzhou.

589
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:03,010
But I often dreamed that

590
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,650
we went back to Nandu.

591
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,080
The three of us are still together.

592
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:08,590
[One month later]

593
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:17,930
Your Majesty.

594
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:21,180
His Majesty has ascended the throne.

595
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:24,380
Now the world is peaceful.

596
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,120
In the Beidu Palace,

597
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:27,340
everyone

598
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,130
is looking forward to your return.

599
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:33,790
Everyone calls Jiangnan a good place.

600
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,170
I'm in Beidu most of my time.

601
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,300
I wanted to watch the birds and butterflies of Jiangnan

602
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,460
for a few more days.

603
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,900
Your Highness is right.

604
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,840
Now that the empire is safe,

605
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:48,210
even the sound of the sea birds

606
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:51,280
has become more beautiful.

607
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,340
Lord Liu.

608
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,020
Yes, Your Majesty.

609
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,830
Now the rebellion has been pacified and the world has been settled.

610
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,640
You two have contributed a lot.

611
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,210
I'll promote you.

612
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,840
How is a title of a nobility?

613
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,300
Thank you, Your Highness.

614
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,580
But please forgive me, Your Highness.

615
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,220
That's not my ambition.

616
00:41:19,790 --> 00:41:21,190
Although the rebellion has been pacified,

617
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:22,820
the sea is still unstable.

618
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:26,490
I would like to volunteer to guard the coasts

619
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,820
to strengthen our territory

620
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:30,310
and share the burden of His and Her Majesty.

621
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,040
Lord Liu, you are so thoughtful.

622
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,170
This is such an honor for our court.

623
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:38,250
How can I not fulfill it?

624
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:39,860
Thank you, Your Majesty.

625
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:44,000
What about you, Young Master Xiang?

626
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,020
Your Highness,

627
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,730
the coastal defense

628
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:50,890
still has the threat of Nangong Fang.

629
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,860
I'm willing to help Lord Liu

630
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:55,750
and make our coast as strong as possible.

631
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,530
Good.

632
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,020
All the land in the world belongs to the emperor.

633
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,360
All the people in the land are royals.

634
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,380
With the costal defense in the hands of you two,

635
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:12,160
His Majesty and I will be at ease.

636
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,380
Here.

637
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,820
If you hadn't reminded me,

638
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:38,240
I wouldn't have thought of such a good way to escape.

639
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:43,820
Since ancient times, those who have achieved commendable results won't have a good ending.

640
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:45,780
Just stay away from places where troubles occur

641
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,120
and hope for the best.

642
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,510
With you guarding the coast,

643
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,140
I can rest assured.

644
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:53,880
That's just empty words.

645
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:55,240
I didn't promise you I'd go.

646
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:58,880
You're going back on your words?

647
00:42:59,160 --> 00:42:59,790
I'm going back on my words?

648
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:00,830
Young Master Xiang,

649
00:43:01,390 --> 00:43:03,230
I respect you as a swordsman and a confidant.

650
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,050
You can't go back on your word.

651
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:08,500
The swordsmen portrayed in novels are not real.

652
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:09,950
You can't trust it.

653
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,480
If you really think of me as your confidant,

654
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:13,930
don't make it difficult for me anymore.

655
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,270
How about this?

656
00:43:27,990 --> 00:43:29,030
I'll go with you if you win.

657
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:30,510
If you lose,

658
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:31,950
don't mention it again.

659
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:34,380
Are you bullying me?

660
00:43:34,550 --> 00:43:35,020
I dare not.

661
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,860
I said I don't like gambling

662
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:38,340
but I never said I couldn't win.

663
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:43,860
Let's play dice.

664
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,970
Just one game.

665
00:43:45,690 --> 00:43:46,210
Sure.

666
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:17,040
- Why don’t you–
- I don’t know when we will meet again after we part today.

667
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:20,010
If I need your help in the future,

668
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,580
I hope you won't forget

669
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,100
our promise.

670
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:28,540
Fine.

671
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,660
Return me my dice.

672
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:32,910
This shall be the evidence.

673
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:48,140
[Liansheng House]

674
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:54,540
See?

675
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,220
This is called looking forward to something

676
00:44:57,530 --> 00:44:58,610
and being unable to wait for it.

677
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:01,260
I understand, I understand.

678
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:04,030
Longing makes one day feel like

679
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:05,070
three years.

680
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:06,740
Besides,

681
00:45:07,230 --> 00:45:09,050
you just experienced life and death.

682
00:45:11,260 --> 00:45:12,260
You're so salty.

683
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,560
Just tell me if you're jealous.

684
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,410
Mingyu,

685
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,130
it's all thanks to you this time,

686
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:20,090
for willing to live and die with me,

687
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:22,220
and giving up all your family wealth.

688
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,390
But for the Su family,

689
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:26,010
the price is too high.

690
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,620
Although I'm not as ambitious as you,

691
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:33,190
Nandu is a place where I was born and raised.

692
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:36,550
How can I watch it suffer in war?

693
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,120
You brat.

694
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:38,660
Don't be flattered just by a mere few words of his.

695
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,840
Don't forget how he used us before.

696
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:42,460
Jin,

697
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,680
I've been feeling guilty for all I have done in the past.

698
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:48,380
Stop talking nonsense.

699
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:50,780
Here.

700
00:45:52,090 --> 00:45:54,360
Let's not talk much. Let's drink.

701
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,030
Here.

702
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:03,460
When you left last time,

703
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,880
you said we would become sworn brothers when we return.

704
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:07,980
You're so longwinded.

705
00:46:09,620 --> 00:46:11,120
We don't need to be so old-fashioned.

706
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:14,910
Just drink this up and we'll be brothers forever.

707
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:17,580
Wait.

708
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:21,560
You two are becoming sworn brothers without me?

709
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:23,190
Count me in.

710
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:24,740
Come.

711
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:25,750
Here.

712
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:33,280
Jin,

713
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:36,980
look who's here.

714
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:11,920
Thank you for your hard work for Jishan Hall.

715
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:19,460
It's good that you're back.

716
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:05,830
Brother Yun.

717
00:48:07,340 --> 00:48:08,710
Are you thinking about the past?

718
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:10,750
What past?

719
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,120
I don't remember anything.

720
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:16,060
What’s your plan for your future?

721
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,990
We'll talk about the future in the future.

722
00:48:23,900 --> 00:48:24,730
Just remember that

723
00:48:25,550 --> 00:48:28,470
there will be no more Young Master Xiang in the world.

724
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:03,220
It's been a long time since I've had your cooking.

725
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:08,830
What are you waiting for? Sit down and have a taste.

726
00:49:16,950 --> 00:49:17,410
Sister.

727
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:21,210
Don't you blame me?

728
00:49:22,570 --> 00:49:23,780
It's rare for us

729
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:25,850
to have a meal together.

730
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:27,740
Why should I blame you?

731
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:32,770
Today, you can enjoy your meal in peace.

732
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:36,160
Once you're at peace, you won't be afraid of anything.

733
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:48,390
Yun Xiang.

734
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:52,040
Do you know what it means for you

735
00:49:53,350 --> 00:49:54,170
to take this path?

736
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:56,650
How could I not know?

737
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:00,330
But I'm tired.

738
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:04,250
When I think about how when the sun rises,

739
00:50:04,980 --> 00:50:05,740
I have to face

740
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:08,140
the chaos that knows no ends again,

741
00:50:09,780 --> 00:50:10,880
with the soldiers fighting each other,

742
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,710
traps in traps,

743
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,440
I feel sick.

744
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:19,980
I'll personally order the branches

745
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:20,890
to disband the soldiers.

746
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:24,850
But this is the last time I help you.

747
00:50:27,130 --> 00:50:27,810
You're leaving?

748
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:32,780
You formed an alliance with the court.

749
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:35,780
When you pacify the rebellion,

750
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:37,710
you will definitely be recruited by the court.

751
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:40,870
We have different paths as an official and a bandit.

752
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:45,450
I'm afraid we can only forget each other.

753
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,500
The only important thing in my life

754
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:19,770
is my daughter, Mingzhu.

755
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:21,760
You're wise.

756
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:26,300
You should have a perfect plan to keep Mingzhu alive.

757
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:41,280
What's the point of my life?

758
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:44,780
As long as you're alive, it's meaningful.

759
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,830
♫It's dark but friends are not back♫

760
00:52:16,550 --> 00:52:20,120
♫The night breeze can't understand sadness and heartache♫

761
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:24,380
♫Rain falls all night long and I stay awake♫

762
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:29,920
♫The night rain can't conceal the sorrow♫

763
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:34,480
♫Memory is a book♫

764
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:39,590
♫Who wrote all those stories♫

765
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:44,100
♫Without realizing it♫

766
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:49,460
♫So many years have passed♫

767
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:53,050
♫Flowers fall into the garden♫

768
00:52:53,740 --> 00:52:58,530
♫Dear friends, why haven't we met earlier♫

769
00:52:58,860 --> 00:53:07,540
♫Destiny is so cruel♫

770
00:53:08,430 --> 00:53:11,390
♫The cloud disperses and mountains are seen♫

771
00:53:11,470 --> 00:53:13,570
♫How many old friends are gone♫

772
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:18,580
♫I raise my cup to beckon the bright moon♫

773
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,800
♫People I miss are thousands of miles away♫

774
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:23,170
♫We let go of the past♫

775
00:53:23,370 --> 00:53:27,620
♫Stories take place thousands of miles away♫

776
00:53:27,650 --> 00:53:30,540
♫The cloud disperses and mountains are seen♫

777
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:32,820
♫How many old friends are gone♫

778
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:37,660
♫I raise my cup to beckon the bright moon♫

779
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:39,980
♫People I miss are thousands of miles away♫

780
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,290
♫We let go of the past♫

781
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:47,170
♫Stories take place thousands of miles away♫

782
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:57,750
♫Stories take place thousands of miles away♫
