[Episode 30: Stronger Attacks from the Enemy]

4
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:46,710
You not only screwed it up,

5
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,530
but also caused one of my trusted subordinates to die for nothing.

6
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,539
Yun Xiang.

7
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,950
I overestimated you.

8
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:54,340
Are you going to kill me?

9
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,250
Maybe.

10
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:09,990
If you don't want to kill me,

11
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:11,780
sit down and let's talk.

12
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,050
Lingyuan Sect is much different now.

13
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,050
You even managed to bring Prince Fu on board.

14
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:27,770
Bastard!

15
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,380
Lingyuan Sect and the illegitimate reign are bitter enemies!

16
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,360
How would we get involved with those jerks?

17
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,190
Then,

18
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,960
the Kou family didn't know

19
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,860
Nangong Fang had colluded with Prince Fu either.

20
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,579
I've warned about his disloyalty

21
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,370
and advised to kill him to save future problems.

22
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,060
But no one believed me.

23
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,090
This makes sense then.

24
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,920
It seems that Prince Fu was the one

25
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,710
who got those two royal decrees to put the Su family in its place

26
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,880
and pave the way for Nangong Fang.

27
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:58,560
Nangong Fang relies on Prince Fu

28
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,980
to build most of his networks in Jiangnan.

29
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,670
But I don't understand

30
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,250
what benefits colluding with Lingyuan Sect

31
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,310
could bring to Prince Fu.

32
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,600
Do you mean that

33
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,190
Prince Fu may not know the real identity of Nangong Fang?

34
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:21,829
Anyway.

35
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,340
We might as well continue to work together

36
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,010
and make plans accordingly when the right time comes.

37
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,620
Why are you looking at me like that?

38
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,070
I'm thinking about

39
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,860
which part of what you said is trustworthy.

40
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,690

48
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,820
Although Magistrate Shao is not an official with integrity,

49
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,279
he's a sensible man.

50
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,839
Don't worry too much.

51
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,730
I just don't understand.

52
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,440
Mr. Nangong is a genius in business.

53
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,100
On the contrary,

54
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:33,050
those bandits from Lingyuan Sect

55
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,450
are all despicable, rude, and reckless.

56
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,170
They don't know how to make money by doing business.

57
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,510
So, Mr. Nangong can't be from Lingyuan Sect,

58
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:44,670
right?

59
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,000
No matter who he is,

60
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,370
we should avoid trouble whenever possible

61
00:04:49,890 --> 00:04:51,380
in such a turbulent time.

62
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,690
I think we should draw a line with him

63
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,090
and spare all later trouble.

64
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:01,800
To draw a line with him? I don't think that's a good idea.

65
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,910
You know

66
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,570
every time I went to Beidu to see His Majesty,

67
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,950
I could return home safe and sound.

68
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,390
Part of the reason is His Majesty's trust in me.

69
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:11,990
But besides that, do you know how much money

70
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,100
I used to make relevant arrangements?

71
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,220
Do you know

72
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,680
where the money came from?

73
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,980
Could it be that

74
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,710
all the businesses under your name

75
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,980
are being managed by Nangong Fang?

76
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:22,930
Yes.

77
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,570
Can you find someone else to replace him?

78
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:33,550
How about Gongquan?

79
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,250
No.

80
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,960
Well, sit down.

81
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,820
Why?

82
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,480
First of all, he's an imperial guard now.

83
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:45,980
He's busy with his own duty.

84
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,110
Even if we put that aside, he's not in Nandu now.

85
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,920
It will take him some time to come back.

86
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,290
Besides,

87
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,100
this matter needs to be addressed as soon as possible.

88
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:54,420
Yes.

89
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:56,490
I think

90
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,659
maybe that person can help.

91
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,370
Bi Yuewu was detained by the government

92
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:05,610
and was under heavy guard.

93
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,320
How could she escape

94
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:09,970
so easily?

95
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,790
I have a question for you too.

96
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,220
You promised to help me save her.

97
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,460
But why did you kill her?

98
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,950
I made minor sacrifices for the greater good.

99
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,190
I had no choice.

100
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,850
Lady Kou, what do you think of

101
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,540
the accident last night?

102
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,820
Was it a coincidence?

103
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:26,130
Or was it designed by someone?

104
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,330
It couldn't be a coincidence.

105
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,960
Then who was behind it?

106
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,420
If Prince Fu hadn't been there yesterday,

107
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,970
Magistrate Shao would have arrested us.

108
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:40,320
Yun Xiang definitely has something to do with this.

109
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,270
But this is not like his usual style.

110
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,340
Yes.

111
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,480
He wouldn't want to hurt you,

112
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,130
would he?

113
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,659
But will Mr. Kou,

114
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,010
who is stonehearted,

115
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,460
be merciful to you

116
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,670
like Yun Xiang?

117
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,100
What do you mean?

118
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,060
I received a secret report last night.

119
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,450
Mr. Kou killed a bodyguard of Master.

120
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,200
His whereabouts are still unknown.

121
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:11,310
It doesn't matter anymore.

122
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:12,460
Nangong Fang,

123
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,500
I'm gonna put aside the matter of

124
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,140
how you colluded with Prince Fu.

125
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,500
Given the current situation,

126
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,120
we can't stay in Nandu anymore.

127
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,730
We are under suspicion.

128
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,410
If the government wants to arrest us,

129
00:07:25,790 --> 00:07:27,930
no matter how intertwined with Prince Fu,

130
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,690
he won't protect you.

131
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,870
The danger in your eyes

132
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,630
is a rare opportunity

133
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,780
for me.

134
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,820
So,

135
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,010
you've long been waiting for this chaos.

136
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,490
Maybe.

137
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,820
Maybe not.

138
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,330
Now, all the forces with different intentions

139
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,980
are all here.

140
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,500
Lady Kou.

141
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,380
Please just wait and see.

142
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:00,880
Lady Kou.

143
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,280
Cross the river immediately

144
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,360
and send this to Master.

145
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,700
If anyone tries to stop you,

146
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,010
even if it's someone in the sect,

147
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,100
destroy it immediately.

148
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,550
I understand.

149
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,520
Madam Kou.

150
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,490
Is Lady Kou in trouble?

151
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,049
No.

152
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:36,380
Instead, I think things went too smoothly.

153
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:39,030
In just a few days,

154
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:43,450
the business world in Nandu is almost under control.

155
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:44,740
I didn't expect Nangong Fang

156
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:47,700
to ally himself with Prince Fu

157
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,810
to do business together.

158
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:53,950
I think Nangong Fang knows that

159
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,680
the sect needs his money and supplies.

160
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,180
That's why he dared to tell Lady Kou

161
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,620
the secret.

162
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:01,550
Madam Kou.

163
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,670
According to the sect rules, he violated a taboo.

164
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:06,320
We could summon him back with this excuse

165
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,220
and deal with him.

166
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,600
No, Mr. Cao.

167
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,820
We can't do this.

168
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,290
If we kill him rashly,

169
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:13,250
we'll have nowhere else

170
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,070
to get money to sustain the sect.

171
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,220
But if he controls Nandu,

172
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,630
it'll be harder to deal with him.

173
00:09:17,650 --> 00:09:19,500
You didn't get to the crux of the matter.

174
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:23,510
To achieve great things, we can't get personal.

175
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,130
Nangong Fang is a crafty devil.

176
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,760
It took him ten years to make plans.

177
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,540
He designed the current situation.

178
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:34,650
I thought he would do the same thing in Nandu,

179
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,460
but I didn't expect it to be such a disaster.

180
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,540
I think what he has done this time

181
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:43,620
is quite unusual.

182
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:45,490
Actually, I always feel that

183
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,840
Nangong Fang's behavior

184
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,020
goes against the style of the Lingyuan Sect.

185
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,050
He's more like someone from Yuntai.

186
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:54,970
Madam Kou.

187
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,480
There must be something wrong with his unusual behavior.

188
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,500
Is there a bigger conspiracy behind this?

189
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,810
No matter what. There's no turning back now.

190
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:32,710
Lower your voice.

191
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,820
They are still sleeping.

192
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,820
I wouldn't believe it if I weren't seeing this with my own eyes.

193
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:41,260
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

194
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,980
How did you get into the habit

195
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,340
of drinking early in the morning?

196
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,520
Even though you are having a row with that brat,

197
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,970
you can still come to see the kids.

198
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,020
Aren't these Yun Xiang's clothes?

199
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,000
Still the old price, ten taels of gold, right?

200
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:20,470
I want you to protect Yun Xiang.

201
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,090
Take it.

202
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:35,220
Why does it have to be me?

203
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,130
Do me a favor.

204
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,980
I don't want to talk to him today.

205
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,580
You adults are so troublesome.

206
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,420
What did you do?

207
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:53,020
Tianhu doesn't want to talk to you.

208
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,270
I'm going to stay in Liansheng House for a few days.

209
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,150
She's not happy about it.

210
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,690
Say something nice for me.

211
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,430
OK.

212
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,580
I'll take care of it.

213
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,500
Really?

214
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:04,980
Boss.

215
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,850
I'm being serious.

216
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,860
You are more literate than other kids here.

217
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,300
From now on,

218
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,940
I want you to lead other boys and girls

219
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,680
to learn and read. Okay?

220
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:17,810
No.

221
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:19,750
Boss.

222
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:25,670
Don't hurry to leave.

223
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,060
I'll make you another bracelet.

224
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,620
Boss, there's no need for that.

225
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,100
I still keep the one you made for me last time.

226
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,460
Listen to me.

227
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,860
Be careful no matter how skilled you are in martial arts.

228
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,060
I think you just can't settle down.

229
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,410
It has only been a few peaceful days. Now you want to go out again.

230
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,380
No.

231
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,000
What's good about the world out there?

232
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
I really have something to do.

233
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,500
I'll be back after I'm done.

234
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:27,460
I don't believe it.

235
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,100
You said

236
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,220
you didn't want to settle down

237
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,540
because you were used to being adrift.

238
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:32,840
Things are different now.

239
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,210
I don't want to leave the kids...

240
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,050
And... And you.

241
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,460
I'm leaving.

242
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,470
Jin.

243
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,050
I'll wait for you to come back.

244
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:13,900
Young Master.

245
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,220
You've picked hundreds of samples from the warehouse.

246
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,320
Of course we have to choose the best.

247
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,070
Mrs. Su.

248
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,610
These are all samples of every year's tribute cloth.

249
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,740
All of them are the best.

250
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,620
But even for different kinds of tribute cloth,

251
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,450
there are still slight differences.

252
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,170
That's right.

253
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,740
Now the Su family

254
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,980
is no longer the royal supplier.

255
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,490
Now they are re-selecting the royal supplier.

256
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,890
This is the only chance for us to make a comeback.

257
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,970
We need something incomparable.

258
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:41,930
The more careful we are, the bigger chance we have.

259
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,580
This is it.

260
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,900
Silk organza.

261
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,520
This is silk organza?

262
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:55,520
I heard that the Su family

263
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:57,210
became the royal supplier because of this.

264
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:57,980
That's right.

265
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,090
The skill of producing silk organza is exclusive to our family.

266
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,710
The weavers are getting better at making this these years.

267
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:04,580
Silk organza it is.

268
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,220
I'm confident we can win with this.

269
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,060
You won't tell me if I don't look into this, right?

270
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,390
Mr. Kang, don't be angry.

271
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:12,130
We're just following Mr. Mo's orders.

272
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,180
In just two days,

273
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:17,100
you've deposited 150,000 taels in Dafeng Bank.

274
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,130
Do you know

275
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,820
you've used

276
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,370
most of the money we have?

277
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,270
Why are you giving him a hard time?

278
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,340
Don't worry.

279
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,820
I didn't use the money of the Su family,

280
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,860
the merchants in Nandu,

281
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,220
or our own.

282
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,370
No matter if I can win the gamble with Nangong Fang,

283
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,530
we won't suffer a great loss.

284
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,240
Uncle,

285
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:41,250
we are using up the money in our treasury.

286
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,930
Get the carriage ready.

287
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:44,670
Yes.

288
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:46,620
Uncle.

289
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,700
You're going to use Master Guan's money?

290
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,340
I'll pick up the goods now.

291
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,370
If we can launder all those goods,

292
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:57,110
we can get more than 100,000 taels.

293
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:00,230
With this huge amount of money, we can be assured.

294
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,980
Even if I lose all this money,

295
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,180
I have two years to repay Guan.

296
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:04,980
Uncle,

297
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,100
this is not your style.

298
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,980
Why take the risk?

299
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,430
Risk?

300
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:11,660
What risk?

301
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:12,690
If I win,

302
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,160
it's Nangong Fang who should be worried.

303
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:14,880
If you lose the money,

304
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,680
I'll incite Guan

305
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,630
to teach Nangong Fang a lesson.

306
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,220
I don't even have to do it myself.

307
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:21,680
Uncle.

308
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,520
No matter what,

309
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,030
we have to pay first

310
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,460
and wait for Master Guan's money.

311
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,680
If Master Guan breaks his promise,

312
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:31,580
-then... -Shut up!

313
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,280
Don't jinx it.

314
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:35,130
Uncle.

315
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,650
Uncle.

316
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:45,330
Mr. Yun, please enjoy.

317
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,010
Why is there only one cup?

318
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:52,860
I quit drinking.

319
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,780
You can quit drinking,

320
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,220
but I'm afraid you can't forget her.

321
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:00,470
By the way,

322
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,840
why did you suddenly come back to Liansheng House?

323
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:21,250
She got in touch with you?

324
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:22,960
She also gave me some gold.

325
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,550
Guess if she wants me to kill you

326
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,430
or to protect you?

327
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,700
It's a good thing if she wants you to kill me.

328
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,550
If so,

329
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,740
both of us can be relieved.

330
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:42,060
Well, if that's the case,

331
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,700
things will be easier for me as well.

332
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,300
How did you two

333
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,590
become enemies?

334
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:51,910
As your enemy,

335
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,700
she asked me to protect you.

336
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,080
What are you doing?

337
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,470
Can't you just

338
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,520
talk things through?

339
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,200
It's okay if you don't want to.

340
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,490
Then, tell me

341
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,570
who wants to kill you this time.

342
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,360
Jin.

343
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,650
It's not that I don't want to tell you,

344
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:17,160
but it's too complicated.

345
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,130
You've just lived in peace for a few days.

346
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,600
I really don't want you to get involved in this again.

347
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,300
It's too late.

348
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,460
I've taken the money.

349
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:24,900
I have to do my job.

350
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,130
This is a matter of morality.

351
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:31,580
Cheers.

352
00:18:32,870 --> 00:18:33,860
I forgot that you quit drinking.

353
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:38,620
Don't worry.

354
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,010
In the whole Nandu,

355
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,320
few merchants can

356
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,780
compete with us in the selection.

357
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,710
In terms of experience and craftsmanship,

358
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:50,950
we are the best.

359
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,360
I'm not worried about other things.

360
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,380
I'm just worried about

361
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,860
how much money it will cost.

362
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,630
From raw materials and weavers

363
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,760
to networking...

364
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:06,750
70,000 to 80,000 taels.

365
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,660
I just checked the accounts.

366
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:16,250
We used more than 100,000 taels

367
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:18,320
to acquire the Tang family's business together with Guanghui Bank.

368
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,660
Now we have only a few thousand taels left.

369
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:23,680
Menglan.

370
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,610
I have reached an agreement with Mr. Mo.

371
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,380
As long as the money we need is less than 100,000 taels, we can borrow it from him anytime.

372
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,620
[Su's Residence]

373
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,270
You're willing to accompany me for a few days

374
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,000
only if Yun asks you to.

375
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,380
And now,

376
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:41,380
we're going back to Liansheng House.

377
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,140
Now, the situation is clear.

378
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,760
Besides, you're doing well.

379
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,230
Of course, I have to go back to Liansheng House.

380
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,980
That is also under your name.

381
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,330
I should put equal effort into that.

382
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,070
But I can only feel at ease when you are with me.

383
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:04,740
Mr. Su,

384
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,190
please go to Guanghui Bank with me now.

385
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,020
Mr. Yun has already arrived.

386
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:10,950
Go now.

387
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,220
Be careful.

388
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,020
Master Guan vanished

389
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,940
without a trace.

390
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,650
You wanted to put your money into Dafeng Bank,

391
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,080
so you could earn interest from Nangong Fang.

392
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,320
But you were afraid Nangong Fang would

393
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,300
persuade other merchants to withdraw money from your bank.

394
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,990
And coincidentally,

395
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,660
Master Guan showed up with perfect timing,

396
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:00,910
enabling you to maneuver.

397
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,010
You didn't have doubts at all?

398
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,460
Guan and I have been doing business

399
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,710
for over ten years.

400
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,890
Nothing ever went wrong.

401
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:13,310
Have you forgotten

402
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,220
Kou Lianyi knows about

403
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,130
your relationship with Master Guan?

404
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:18,850
The fact that Kou Lianyi knows

405
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,070
means Nangong Fang knows it too.

406
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,800
Do you think I didn't think about that?

407
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,710
It's obvious that

408
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,690
we've been set up.

409
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:28,690
Under this circumstance,

410
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,390
you can't still trust Master Guan, can you?

411
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:31,760
Over the past decades,

412
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,740
these pirates used to be invincible

413
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,670
at the very first.

414
00:21:36,290 --> 00:21:37,930
But then, they died one by one.

415
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,460
Only Guan survived.

416
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:43,980
Why's that?

417
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,780
Because he's extremely cautious

418
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,960
and never trusts anyone easily.

419
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,660
You don't understand

420
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,240
why he joined hands with Nangong Fang.

421
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,980
I have been laundering the things he robbed

422
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,940
for more than ten years.

423
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,980
That's how I made friends with him.

424
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,980
Doing business with him is highly risky.

425
00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:09,050
So, I'm especially careful.

426
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,660
I bought his trusted aides

427
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,360
to be my spy.

428
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,880
You never knew that he is related to Lingyuan Sect?

429
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:18,820
Never.

430
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,430
Although both Lingyuan Sect and the pirates

431
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,460
are serious troubles for the government,

432
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:25,890
it brings no benefits but only harm to him

433
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,710
if he colludes with Lingyuan Sect.

434
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,500
The only thing Guan wants is money.

435
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,020
Solve the problem at hand first.

436
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,440
Do you have a plan?

437
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:46,970
No.

438
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:05,020
You're here too.

439
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:05,770
Jin.

440
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,020
It has been a long time.

441
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:09,030
Come on, have a drink.

442
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,700
Warrior Jin, I'll drink with you.

443
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:12,780
It's urgent.

444
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:13,950
Mr. Su, go to the study first.

445
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:15,110
Right. Jin.

446
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,460
Not today.

447
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,940
Let's drink till all's blue some other day.

448
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,300
Okay, it's a deal.

449
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:26,980
What happened?

450
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,580
Why are you all so worried?

451
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:33,760
Let's drink.

452
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,520
[Dafeng Bank]

453
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,400
Sir.

454
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,660
Su Mingyu went to Guanghui Bank.

455
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:50,940
Kang Qiao picked him up.

456
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,130
Should we wrap it up?

457
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:53,860
Shut up!

458
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:55,060
Go.

459
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,290
Finish the things I told you to do.

460
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:58,190
Yes.

461
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:05,420
Lady Kou, in your opinion,

462
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,480
is this a good time to wrap things up?

463
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,090
I never thought

464
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:14,420
even the vicious pirates could be used by you.

465
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,380
You're the biggest contributor to this.

466
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,380
Of course you have the right to decide.

467
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,900
Talking about contributions,

468
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,440
I need to thank you for your detailed information.

469
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,060
Otherwise, how could I design this sophisticated plan

470
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,080
to kill two birds with one stone,

471
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:29,450
destroying the Su family and Mo Bufan?

472
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:32,890
My informants

473
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,000
didn't know much about their alliance.

474
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,560
Thanks to your advice,

475
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,460
I know that

476
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:41,010
they've put their money together.

477
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:42,470
If I defeat Mo Bufan,

478
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,180
the Su family will suffer a lot.

479
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,380
I know the whole story now.

480
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,270
But Mr. Mo, you're shrewd. Yun, you're cautious.

481
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,620
How could you fall into the trap?

482
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:02,450
It's not his fault.

483
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:07,360
I was so angry that I made reckless decisions.

484
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:10,110
I wanted to ask for your help with the money

485
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,530
needed for the royal supplier selection.

486
00:25:13,390 --> 00:25:14,190
But now...

487
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,900
The Chamber of Commerce was disbanded,

488
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,460
but I still have some business friends.

489
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,380
I can raise some money in three days

490
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,000
to fill the hole.

491
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,380
If we can get three days to react,

492
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,270
everything can be solved.

493
00:25:27,430 --> 00:25:29,410
But Nangong Fang won't give us the chance.

494
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,920
I think tomorrow morning,

495
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,320
Guanghui Bank will be swamped by merchants

496
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:36,100
who want to withdraw their money.

497
00:25:37,310 --> 00:25:37,910
Or maybe

498
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,050
they'll come earlier than that.

499
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,460
Then do something.

500
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,020
There is nothing I can do.

501
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:49,210
We are now in a corner.

502
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,990
What we need to do now

503
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,760
is to make sacrifices to regain our advantage.

504
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:57,970
We have no other choice now.

505
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,530
In this situation,

506
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,130
we can only rip off the arm to save the body.

507
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,420
I have 50 to 60 thousand taels of silver left in my treasury.

508
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,320
Move the money to the Su family overnight.

509
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,800
Pull through the competition first.

510
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,660
What about you?

511
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:13,840
Hide

512
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:19,300
and start all over again when things cool off.

513
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:25,160
My reputation is completely ruined.

514
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,460
I'll work behind the scenes,

515
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,390
while Kang Qiao takes the steering wheel.

516
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,260
That's one way out.

517
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,740
But no matter what,

518
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,340
you must capture the position

519
00:26:37,410 --> 00:26:38,420
of the royal supplier.

520
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,770
Only when the Su family secures its place,

521
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,300
I can turn the tables as soon as possible.

522
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,390
Besides,

523
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,620
this amount of money is just a drop in the bucket

524
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,300
to the crisis that Guanghui Bank is facing.

525
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,110
Be quick.

526
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,180
Lady Kou, what are you thinking?

527
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,530
I'm thinking

528
00:27:14,610 --> 00:27:15,820
if you dare to be so rude again,

529
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,030
I will punish you severely.

530
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:23,180
We haven't won yet.

531
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,570
Don't get carried away.

532
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,500
Why did you say so?

533
00:27:29,050 --> 00:27:30,250
The Su family has a solid foundation.

534
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,610
Even if it suffers huge losses,

535
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,980
it may not fail in the royal supplier selection.

536
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,860
You are really thorough.

537
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,590
But I've also thought of this

538
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,190
and planned to take the chance tonight

539
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:50,340
to destroy the Su family completely.

540
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,790
The help from Lingyuan Sect should be here soon.

541
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,240
Oh, my!

542
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,150
This huge amount of money

543
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,850
is enough for Jishan Hall to operate for hundreds of years.

544
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:29,190
Now I know why you all look so worried.

545
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,470
Is it that you don't know how to spend all this money?

546
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,580
Are there still rooms available in Jishan Hall?

547
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:36,950
What do you mean?

548
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,510
I'm afraid after tonight,

549
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,810
I'll need to

550
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,560
live off your support.

551
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:45,970
No...

552
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,200
Are you done?

553
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,940
I can't help much here.

554
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,100
Take good care of Mr. Mo

555
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,060
and wait for a chance to turn things around.

556
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,460
Got it.

557
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,340
Mr. Mo,

558
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,390
the carts are ready.

559
00:29:18,470 --> 00:29:19,380
You've been running

560
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,460
Guanghui Bank for 20 years.

561
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:23,880
It is

562
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:28,680
what it is.

563
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,020
I'll get back the money I've lost.

564
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:40,540
Let's go.

565
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,050
Let us in.

566
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:01,550
Yes.

567
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,500
Let us in.

568
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,390
Open the door! Open the door!

569
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:13,280
I want to withdraw my money.

570
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,470
I want to withdraw my money.

571
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,140
Quiet!

572
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:17,910
Quiet!

573
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,090
You are all frequenters.

574
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,300
Why did you break into Guanghui Bank at night?

575
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,670
You don't care about the law

576
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,660
and our relationship at all?

577
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,420
Why are you counting out money

578
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,610
in the middle of the night?

579
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:37,820
It seems that we're here at the right time, right?

580
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,610
Yes.

581
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,220
That's right.

582
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,020
Let me go straight to the point.

583
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,320
Mr. Kang,

584
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:45,420
we are here for only one thing.

585
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,800
We just want to withdraw

586
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:49,900
the money we've deposited in Guanghui Bank.

587
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:52,190
We want our money! We want our money!

588
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,430
No bank will let you withdraw money in the middle of the night.

589
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,860
Get out!

590
00:30:56,870 --> 00:30:57,630
If you want to withdraw money,

591
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:58,990
come back tomorrow morning.

592
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:02,020
I don't think we can find you tomorrow morning.

593
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,700
Right?

594
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:03,900
That's right.

595
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:04,480
Give me my money!

596
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,820
Money! Money!

597
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,320
Chairman Su is really here.

598
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,850
Mr. Nangong was right.

599
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:12,370
Mr. Mo...

600
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:13,640
Isn't this an inside job?

601
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:16,450
Why are they staring at me?

602
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:17,890
This doesn't look good.

603
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,820
Well said.

604
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,450
This is indeed an inside job.

605
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,100
Nangong Fang,

606
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,820
don't go too far.

607
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,020
What have I done?

608
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,150
I just want to seek justice

609
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,620
for the merchants in Nandu.

610
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:40,990
Enough.

611
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,560
Who gives you, an outsider, the right

612
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,730
to butt in on affairs of the business world in Nandu?

613
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:48,900
Mr. Su,

614
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:51,140
you sound righteous.

615
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,910
But your behavior is inconsistent with your words.

616
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,090
It seems that the government's decision

617
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,650
to disband the Chamber of Commerce saved merchants like us.

618
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,560
Yes, it should have been closed long ago.

619
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:01,220
Right?

620
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,220
They actually dare to mug the bank

621
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,730
in Nandu.

622
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:21,420
This is not the worst.

623
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,610
Those who passed us just now

624
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,930
are the most famous merchants in the city.

625
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,620
This is Nangong Fang's trump card.

626
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:34,480
What do you mean?

627
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,350
Just tell me. Should we go back?

628
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:43,700
It's not the time yet.

629
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,090
Just wait.

630
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,410
You deposited 150,000 taels of silver

631
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,020
into Dafeng Bank these days.

632
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,890
You used the money entrusted to you

633
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,620
by these merchants to earn interest from my bank.

634
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:00,920
I don't think it's appropriate.

635
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,590
Mr. Mo, do you admit it or not?

636
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,630
It doesn't matter if he admits it or not.

637
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,410
That's only one way to do business.

638
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,780
If Guanghui Bank

639
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,890
can cash out your deposits today,

640
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:13,180
everything will be fine.

641
00:33:14,010 --> 00:33:15,690
But in the past few months,

642
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,490
Mr. Mo and Mr. Su

643
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:20,040
have been acquiring a lot of businesses in Nandu.

644
00:33:20,310 --> 00:33:22,330
That cost hundreds of thousands of taels.

645
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:24,700
I'm afraid there's not much money left

646
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,090
in the treasury.

647
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,280
As you can see,

648
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,580
if you had come a little bit later,

649
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,510
the last two boxes of silver

650
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,180
would have been sent to the Su family secretly.

651
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,150
Next,

652
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,110
the money you've worked hard to earn

653
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,930
will vanish together with Mr. Mo.

654
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:51,700
Well,

655
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,020
he has the Su family to support him,

656
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,630
so he'll be fine for the rest of his life.

657
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,020
Don't listen to his nonsense.

658
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,010
Think about it.

659
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,860
With so many businesses under Guanghui Bank,

660
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,030
even if it is short of money,

661
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:12,739
can't it run normally?

662
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:15,000
This man is inciting you to create a bank run

663
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:16,909
to suppress Guanghui Bank.

664
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,469
If Guanghui Bank doesn't have enough money,

665
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,730
it is breaking the rules of this industry.

666
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:23,420
You have only yourselves to blame.

667
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:25,340
The Su family has been doing business for about 100 years.

668
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,500
I'm willing to vouch for Mr. Mo with my family's goodwill.

669
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,580
Isn't it more trustworthy than what he said?

670
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,510
Goodwill?

671
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,480
Mo Bufan is emptying the treasury in the middle of the night.

672
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,060
Do you dare to say it has nothing to do with you?

673
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,530
Everybody can see that.

674
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:44,889
You...

675
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:47,139
Check!

676
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:48,130
I dare you!

677
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,219
I dare you!

678
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,410
Uncle.

679
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,200
It's useless.

680
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,190
Well said. A bet is a bet.

681
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:09,770
I admire that you can accept defeat with good grace.

682
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,730
Su Mingyu, remember this.

683
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,460
When tempted by money,

684
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,990
these people

685
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:18,970
won't stay sensible.

686
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:23,730
Kang Qiao!

687
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:26,550
Let's go.

688
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,520
Mr. Mo,

689
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,410
you shouldn't stay in Guanghui Bank now.

690
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:42,420
Leave now.

691
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:43,640
Go.

692
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,300
According to what you said,

693
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,860
Guanghui Bank will be doomed.

694
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,860
Who is Nangong Fang?

695
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,060
He actually got the better of you.

696
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,450
Also,

697
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,390
how did Shu Yanan become Kou Lianyi

698
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,540
and switch to the side of your enemy?

699
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,100
This is too complicated.

700
00:35:58,300 --> 00:35:59,420
-I'll tell you another day. -No.

701
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,240
Not another day.

702
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,190
Mr. Yun.

703
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:12,140
The girl who kept losing last time came again.

704
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:13,340
She brought two other people

705
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,540
and insisted on waiting for you.

706
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,590
Who are they?

707
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,090
I think they're up to no good.

708
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,050
It's fine. Go upstairs and rest.

709
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:21,920
I can handle it.

710
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:33,210
Mr. Yun,

711
00:36:33,620 --> 00:36:34,850
finally, you're back.

712
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:41,060
Greetings, Your Highness.

713
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:45,060
How do you know he's Prince Fu?

714
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,640
Aren't you afraid that you might get his identity wrong?

715
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,680
Is this Mr. Yun?

716
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,260
He's Yun Xiang.

717
00:36:52,630 --> 00:36:53,940
Just as I heard,

718
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:55,060
you have good graces.

719
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,540
Your Highness, I reckon you are here

720
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,940
for the accident last night.

721
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,350
You asked Magistrate Shao

722
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,310
to let the female assassin of the Lingyuan Sect go

723
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,620
to catch her accomplices.

724
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,480
You are quite bold.

725
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,330
Nangong Fang works for me.

726
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,980
As you're going after him,

727
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:19,070
you are against me.

728
00:37:32,670 --> 00:37:34,790
The weather is dry.

729
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,330
Beware of fire.

730
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:40,980
I didn't expect you and I

731
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,260
to hit it off straight away.

732
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,290
It's already midnight.

733
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:48,590
Luckily, Mingzhu has gone back home.

734
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:49,920
Otherwise, it would be too late for her to go to bed

735
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:52,220
and she'd definitely get mad at me during the day.

736
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,390
It's my honor

737
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,460
to resonate with Your Highness.

738
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,620
It's settled then.

739
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,340
Deal.

740
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,640
I'll see you off when you leave.

741
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:05,650
Don't bother, Your Highness.

742
00:38:07,010 --> 00:38:08,850
Alright, you don't need to walk me out.

743
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:24,060
They've got the money they want.

744
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,220
Why did they have to destroy the place?

745
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,740
We always

746
00:39:30,290 --> 00:39:31,460
ingratiate ourselves

747
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:32,320
with those merchants

748
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,780
and be polite to them.

749
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,140
The moment we got into trouble,

750
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,160
they changed attitudes.

751
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:40,750
Forget it.

752
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:43,240
Forget it.

753
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,180
It's human nature.

754
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:49,280
It's human nature.

755
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:52,950
Uncle,

756
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:54,740
let's go.

757
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,100
More people will come to ask for their money.

758
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,300
I'm afraid we can't get away if we delay.

759
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:03,040
Let's go.

760
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:08,220
Go.

761
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:14,970
Go.

762
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:18,960
Let's go.

763
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:27,980
Mingyu,

764
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,660
it's not that we don't want to lend you the money.

765
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,660
Given what happened in Guanghui Bank last night,

766
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,940
if we lend you the money now,

767
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,780
we're standing against all the merchants in Nandu.

768
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,340
To be honest,

769
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:44,850
given that you sent out dozens of invitations,

770
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,160
the fact that the three of us can come

771
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,430
is for old times' sake.

772
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,890
Now the Su family is at stake.

773
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,910
If you are willing to help,

774
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,430
I will do my best to help you if you need me in the future.

775
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:00,760
Mingyu, take my advice.

776
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:04,580
Your priority now is to make clarifications

777
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,010
and restore your reputation.

778
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,330
Only after that

779
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,660
can we help you.

780
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:14,740
Young Master.

781
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,460
A girl surnamed Kou is here to see you.

782
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,340
Sister.

783
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:00,210
Mingyu told me about what happened recently.

784
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:01,970
No one expected

785
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,480
this would happen.

786
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,180
If you have any difficulties,

787
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:08,940
can you tell me?

788
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:11,580
We are both women.

789
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,550
Maybe I can understand.

790
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:17,440
It is what it is.

791
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,160
Anything I say would only be excuses.

792
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,030
You'd better not ask.

793
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,500
You burned down Yufeng Warehouse

794
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:29,110
and almost destroyed the Su family.

795
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,380
And now you're on Nangong Fang's side.

796
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,260
You finally got what you wanted.

797
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,850
Tell me, what else do you want?

798
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,300
Mr. Nangong wants to buy the craftsmanship of silk organza.

799
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,010
I know what you're up to.

800
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:11,290
Go back and tell him

801
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:15,370
I won't give it to him even if it's lost.
