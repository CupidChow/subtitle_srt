4
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:53,720
Mr. Su.

5
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,530
Mingyu.

6
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:11,020
Menglan, you want to see me?

7
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,770
Mr. Su.

8
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:21,079
Can we talk inside?

9
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,800
Come in quickly.

10
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:27,940
Hurry.

11
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:30,230
Sit here.

12
00:03:35,329 --> 00:03:37,050
When I woke up, the sun was setting in the west.

13
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,540
It already felt like a dream.

14
00:03:39,329 --> 00:03:41,760
When I saw you, I thought I was still dreaming.

15
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,579
Momentarily, I was in a daze and couldn't come to my senses.

16
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:48,710
Take it as a dream then.

17
00:03:49,210 --> 00:03:49,820
It doesn't matter.

18
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,210
You're here at such a time.

19
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,240
Is there something you want to talk about with me?

20
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,870
Can't I visit you casually

21
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:02,660
and have a chat?

22
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,660
We've been busy with Liansheng House these days.

23
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,080
I was afraid to disturb you.

24
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:13,660
But whenever I saw you,

25
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,980
I always wanted to spend more time with you.

26
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,190
Do you have wine?

27
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,230
Wine?

28
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:26,950
Yes.

29
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,690
They did deliver some apricot blossom wine here.

30
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,780
Since you're in such a good mood,

31
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,420
let's drink some apricot blossom wine.

32
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,480
I heard it was brewed with spring water that was collected for years.

33
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,140
Before, I purposely hid it.

34
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,670
I was afraid Jin might steal it.

35
00:04:47,409 --> 00:04:48,890
I wonder how he is now.

36
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,810
When he comes back,

37
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,900
he can drink as much of this wine as he wants.

38
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:08,490
Let's focus on us and not talk about others today.

39
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,130
I'm here to thank you for your generous kindness.

40
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:18,300
Then let's exchange our hearts.

41
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,159
It's really true that it's not the wine that intoxicates but the drinker who gets himself drunk.

42
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:37,830
Every time I see you,

43
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,390
I feel intoxicated.

44
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:47,040
I've never gotten drunk before.

45
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,660
Master.

46
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,780
Can you let me drink some now?

47
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,520
What's the hurry?

48
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,630
We're still working on it.

49
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,830
Tell me first, what good news do you have?

50
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,580
My Miss asked me to tell you that

51
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,050
we don't have to be entangled with Young Master Xiang anymore.

52
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,720
She came up with a good idea

53
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,890
for Liansheng House to quit the competition directly.

54
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,220
Which Miss? Ke Menglan?

55
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,460
She finally figured out

56
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,670
who treats her well, right?

57
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:53,110
She didn't know you were nice to me.

58
00:06:53,690 --> 00:06:56,370
She also said I was poisoned by you.

59
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:59,580
She said if she helps you win the competition,

60
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:01,110
you would give me the antidote.

61
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,300
Then she'll bring me away. But I won't leave.

62
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,940
I belong to you, Master.

63
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,900
Give me the antidote, please.

64
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:08,340
Kneel properly!

65
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,000
I feel unbearably sick.

66
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:16,140
Tell me first, what idea did she come up with?

67
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,140
She'll falsify Liansheng House's accounts,

68
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,430
then you'll will send someone to inspect them.

69
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,540
As long as the inspection result is announced,

70
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,360
according to the rules,

71
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,960
Liansheng House will be forfeited out of the competition.

72
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:31,720
Wonderful.

73
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,700
But Young Master Xiang's likely to notice that

74
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,340
there's something up with Ke Menglan.

75
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,460
How would he let her manage the ledger?

76
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:43,290
Miss Ke has always been in charge of Liansheng House's accounting.

77
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:46,090
Young Master Xiang's room doors have been tightly shut these days.

78
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,000
There hasn't been a squeak from inside either.

79
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,700
Maybe he's afraid of losing

80
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,370
and ran away long ago.

81
00:07:55,650 --> 00:07:56,290
Ran away?

82
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,870
Young Master Xiang wouldn't have run away.

83
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,790
It's even more unlikely that he'd be constrained by others.

84
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,900
This must be a trick.

85
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:04,500
Fine.

86
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,780
I'll play along with his tricks.

87
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,420
Go back and tell Ke Menglan

88
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,040
to give it a try.

89
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,180
Once she succeeds,

90
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:16,400
I'll not only fulfill my promise,

91
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,110
but I might also provide additional rewards.

92
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,580
My lord.

93
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,940
Save her! What are you waiting for?

94
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,960
Save her first! Hurry!

95
00:08:38,049 --> 00:08:38,690
What a pity.

96
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:41,510
She won't be able to live for long.

97
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,980
The essence of food

98
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,620
is to emphasize each ingredient's flavor.

99
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,890
You're mixing everything up so much

100
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,930
that the taste is ruined.

101
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,980
How are you still so picky when you're living under someone else's roof?

102
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:09,980
What do you know?

103
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,460
This is called five-flavored mixed dish. It's a delicacy.

104
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,340
Add some salt.

105
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:15,390
I can add the salt.

106
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:17,370
That's too much!

107
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,980
Can you be more sensible?

108
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:20,060
Go get Kang Qiao for dinner.

109
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:21,500
Okay.

110
00:09:24,050 --> 00:09:24,660
Screw you!

111
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,510
Wait.

112
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:32,400
Open it.

113
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:38,400
Didn't I tell you we only want silver in small bits?

114
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,640
That's right, I just remembered it now.

115
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,640
Manager, don't be angry.

116
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,700
I'll exchange it now.

117
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,940
Be more careful with your work.

118
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,400
If Mr. Mo were here,

119
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,730
you'd be reprimanded one by one.

120
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,580
You're right.

121
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,700
We'll be more careful next time.

122
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:51,540
Hurry up.

123
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,340
Mr. Kang, you sure are kind-hearted.

124
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,820
Mr. Mo gives the stick while you offer the carrot.

125
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,420
A blend of delicacy and force.

126
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,050
What a brilliant combination of leadership.

127
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,510
Dinner is ready. Let's go.

128
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,130
Go ahead first, Mr. Yun.

129
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,340
I still need to help you

130
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,980
gather the 20,000 taels of silver in small bits,

131
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,620
lest your master plan gets ruined.

132
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,980
Actually, I know you just took over the Cao Sect

133
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,480
and need some time to smooth things over.

134
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,310
Pardon me for asking for

135
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,580
such a large sum of silver

136
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,950
all of a sudden.

137
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,460
No worries.

138
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,100
We'll never refuse

139
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:28,460
your requests.

140
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:30,050
Nor do we dare to do so.

141
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,170
You're too generous with your compliments.

142
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,250
You misunderstood.

143
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,880
I just don't want to miss this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity

144
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,160
to make money.

145
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,220
I didn't expect you to show a strength of character just like your dad's,

146
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,660
at such a young age.

147
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:46,390
You are really...

148
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,520
I've prepared the silver in small bits for you.

149
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,040
I also know about your damn idea.

150
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,500
But can Tang Xiao really just let things slide

151
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:01,340
and turn a blind eye?

152
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,460
Let me tell you.

153
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,100
Those who've been visiting Tang's Gambling House lately

154
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,390
are spies he planted in Liansheng House.

155
00:11:08,410 --> 00:11:11,170
Are you worried that Liansheng House won't last until the end of the competition?

156
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,180
Don't worry.

157
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:15,930
I know Tang Xiao's means.

158
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,890
Now that Shu Yanan and Su Mingyu are at Liansheng House,

159
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,100
they wouldn't dare to stir up trouble.

160
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,770
Do you really believe them?

161
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,180
One's an unknown female killer,

162
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:30,660
one's a wealthy dandy,

163
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:34,970
and one's a Swordsman who only cares about money.

164
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,610
Look carefully at who's around you.

165
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,260
It's just like Mr. Mo's fried rice,

166
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,350
where each flavor is distinct in a five-flavored mixed dish,

167
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,490
culminating into a unique flavor.

168
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,130
Delicious, indeed.

00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:54,770
♫I wish to hold your hand and give my all♫

185
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,340
I'm afraid I can't wait.

186
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,890
♫And to have each other♫

187
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:01,520
♫As the seasons past, your fragrance makes my heart flutter♫

188
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:05,650
♫A life in the martial world that is always in turmoil♫

189
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,000
Don't be silly.

190

♫Good times with you seem like a dream, accompanied by the wind♫

191
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,830
I just want to be yours today.

♫She's gazing at you, untainted♫

193
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,980
Wait, Menglan.

194
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,220
Menglan.

195

♫Frost and snow brushed past the eyes and brows♫

196
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,010
What's the matter with you?

197
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,310
♫She murmured♫

198
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,370
I'm indebted to you.

199
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:27,280
♫An appointment for a lifetime♫

200
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,670
I've nothing to repay you with.

201

♫Hiding a tear♫

202
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,590
I just want to be your woman.

203
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:33,500
Is that not okay with you?

204
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,740
♫She's unyielding♫

205
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:36,330
Menglan.

206

♫One journey, one glance, one thought about missing you♫

207
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:42,940
What do you take me for?

208
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,820
Do you think getting intimate with me

209
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,780
would write off everything

210
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,700
we've went through together?

211
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:51,340
But,

212
00:13:53,330 --> 00:13:55,490
in your eyes, I'm just like any other men.

213
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:57,100
But this is not what I want.

214
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:01,640
♫There once was ignorance as we smiled gently♫

215
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,530
What I want is empathetic love and devotion.

♫Your beauty melted the cold winter♫

217
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:05,740
How you're acting now is not only underestimating me,

00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,610
♫I wish to hold your hand and give my all♫

219
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,250

♫Good times with you seem like a dream, accompanied by the wind♫

226
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,650
Something must have happened.

227
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:27,920
What happened?

228

♫She's gazing at you, untainted♫

229

♫One journey, one glance, one thought about missing you♫

239
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,260
Master asked me to bring Manager Qi here.

240
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,970
He's waiting outside now.

241
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:01,910
Miss Ke.

242
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,480
You just need to edit the accounts

243
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,180
and let Manager Qi come in to inspect them.

244
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,610
Then, our wishes will come true.

245
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,340
Once you're done,

246
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:26,020
Manager Qi will report to the government with the ledger.

247
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,830
Then, everything will be over.

248
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,590
Miss Ke, what's wrong?

249
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,220
Meeting Master meant you being elevated out of your lowly status

250
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,340
and me possibly being cured of my fatal illness.

251
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,480
We should be happy.

252
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:54,620
Miss Ke.

253
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,410
Stop hesitating.

254
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,860
Jin's life is involved too.

255
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,320
When it's done,

256
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,480
we'll leave Nandu

257
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,090
and never come back.

258
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,100
I'll guard the door,

259
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:42,580
so that you can meticulously edit the accounts in peace.

260
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,950
Make it seem like it's done intentionally

261
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,840
so that it can be discerned at a glance.

262
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,160
Yun Xiang.

263
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,200
Mr. Su.

264
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,530
I have something important to discuss with Yun.

265
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,540
He's not in the room?

266
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,460
Indeed, Yun Xiang does have other plans.

267
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,700
I knew it.

268
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:54,950
To deal with Tang Xiao,

269
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,700
these superficial means are pointless.

270
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,220
Then why are you in such a hurry to look for him?

271
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,560
I'm worried that Menglan is hiding something from me.

272
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,410
I'm afraid it's related to Tang Xiao.

273
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,520
You knew about it already?

274
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,760
It's fine that Yun kept it from me,

275
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:18,980
but you too?

276
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:21,610
You always say you're close as sisters.

277
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,360
Yet you just watch her be led astray?

278
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,930
You know better than me how much

279
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,110
Menglan yearns to be elevated out of her lowly status.

280
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,260
Right now, her fate

281
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,410
is in Tang Xiao's hands.

282
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,810
If you put yourself in her shoes,

283
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:34,940
if you were her,

284
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,320
what would you choose?

285
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,800
You can't make a choice, right?

286
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:44,420
It's fine if Tang Xiao can really help her.

287
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,550
But you know what kind of a person he is.

288
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,940
Will he keep his promise?

289
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,490
Menglan can't just ignore everything else

290
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,320
out of desperation.

291
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,660
Are you this infuriated

292
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,910
because you're worried that

293
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,630
Menglan will be doomed forever once she goes down the wrong path,

294
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,880
or are you frustrated that you were unable to protect her?

295
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:19,280
Have you ever thought that someone as smart as Menglan

296
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:21,310
would be aware of Tang Xiao's character?

297
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,710
Previously, Tang Xiao planted hidden spies in Liansheng House.

298
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,540
If it wasn't for Menglan,

299
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,690
Liansheng House might not have even survived until today.

300
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,230
Although she hesitated then,

301
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,390
ultimately, she chose us.

302
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,660
It shows that she didn't just blindly give in to Tang Xiao.

303
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,200
I hope I'm just fussing over nothing.

304
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,510
Whatever it is,

305
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,860
as long as Yun Xiang wins against Tang Xiao,

306
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,850
all difficulties will be easily resolved.

307
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,820
It's the last day.

308
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,580
Don't get distracted.

310
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,510

312
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,820
I'm done with the edit.

313
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,960
You can go get Manager Qi now.

Are you looking for Manager Qi of Tang's Gambling House?

317
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,390
You mentioned that

318
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,980
if anyone catches any flaws in this ledger,

319
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,770
this competition will be over.

320
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,580
With Tang Xiao's character,

321
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:01,130
even if you help him win,

322
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:02,860
do you think he'll really keep his promise

323
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,700
and help elevate you out of your lowly status?

324
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,220
Miss. Don't hurt her.

325
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,250
Why don't you kill me?

326
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,940
If you kill me, I'll follow Master

327
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:16,400
to take revenge by killing you all!

328
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:17,780

That's right.

354
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,630

But I was the one who stayed behind in Liansheng House, not him.

367
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:53,820
I was also the one who had to watch my beloved lady

368
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,790
be in duress.

369
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,460
Did you see how Menglan was like these past few days?

370
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:57,980
If Yun Xiang were here,

371
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,900
would he watch you suffer like this?

372
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:01,860
It's hard to say.

373
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,860
He always prioritizes the big picture.

374
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,910
Lack of forbearance in small things upsets great plans.

375
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,620
Before, you vowed solemnly

376
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,600
to learn from him.

377
00:23:09,810 --> 00:23:11,380
You said you wanted to learn strategies and win with wisdom.

378
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,750
How could you abandon your convictions and act as you please?

379
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,900
The competition is not over yet.

380
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,030
You're in a rage now

381
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,150
and you want to bring your men to Tang's Gambling House.

382
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,930
If we fall into Tang Xiao's intentions,

383
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,990
wouldn't it ruin Yun Xiang's overall plan?

384
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:27,420
Let me ask you.

385
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,760
Did you walk out because you really want to compete with Tang Xiao

386
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,950
or because you don't know

387
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,120
how to face Menglan?

388
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,890
I thought Miss Menglan was controlled by Tang Xiao

389
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:46,040
because she wanted to elevate out of her lowly status.

390
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,020
I didn't expect Tianhu to be implicated too.

391
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,170
Menglan made this choice

392
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,890
largely to protect Tianhu's life.

393
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:53,760
I'm not blaming her.

394
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,060
I just hate myself.

395
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,690
But you can't escape what you have to face.

396
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,300
At this moment,

397
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,180
how can I protect Liansheng House alone?

398
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,750
You must stay here.

399
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:10,970
Take the horse away.

400
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,280
Master.

401
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,920
It’s already past curfew.

402
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,700
We're running our business illegally.

403
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,740
I'm here. Nothing's illegal.

404
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,240
Who'd dare to come and inspect?

405
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:27,390
Get lost.

406
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:28,590
Yes.

407
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,180
Servants

408
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,020
don't know how to read the situation.

409
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,220
Sorry about that.

410
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,300
Come on.

411
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,140
Let's play another round.

412
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,430
Another round.

413
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:41,470
Master.

414
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:44,750
Ke Menglan did falsify the accounts.

415
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,590
As you expected,

416
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,530
Shu Yanan and Su Mingyu

417
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,940
saw through Ke Menglan's trick very soon.

418
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,180
But when Su Mingyu

419
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,220
walked out of Liansheng House in a rage

420
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,340
and was ready to come to us,

421
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,620
Shu Yanan walked out too.

422
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,230
I don't know what she said

423
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,120
but she convinced him to go back in.

424
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,660
I know,

425
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:06,420
you...

426
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,850
you're deliberately losing money

427
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,510
to keep Magistrate Shao here.

428
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,460
But now that Su Mingyu is not coming,

429
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:16,090
how much money did we lose in vain?

430
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:29,040
All of you will die a horrible death!

431
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,990
Ke Menglan, if you don't listen to Master,

432
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,370
you'll die a horrible death too!

433
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:39,960
Miss Shu.

434
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,690
Do you really have the antidote?

435
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:42,960
Why?

436
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:44,550
Do you think I'm no longer mad at you?

437
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,560
Why are you preparing an aphrodisiac?

438
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:56,120
This is not an aphrodisiac, but powder from Meizhu.

439
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,830
I made it specifically for her.

440
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,480
It's potent.

441
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,920
Dream on!

442
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:04,350
Meizhu is immune to all poison.

443
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:05,910
Are you trying to harm her?

444
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:08,420
Be careful or my master will catch you

445
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,700
and imprison you in a deep dungeon,

446
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,250
such that you'll live a life worse than death!

447
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:13,530
She...

448
00:26:14,090 --> 00:26:16,010
Tianhu is not usually like that.

449
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,380
What kind of poison is she suffering from?

450
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,720
There are countless kinds of poison in the world.

451
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:23,840
Judging from her behavior, she was poisoned by the Heart Devouring Powder.

452
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,790
What is the Heart Devouring Powder?

453
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,850
Although there are many medical records of it,

454
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,140
the source of this poison is rare

455
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:32,160
and the production requirements are extremely precise.

456
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,250
Few people have succeeded in its production for years.

457
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,670
I didn't expect Tang Xiao to have this unique skill.

458
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,170
This is not the antidote.

459
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,070
It can only delay the spread of the poison.

460
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:44,700
Thank you, Miss Shu.

461
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,950
Don't come over. Don't come over!

462
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,730
Tianhu.

463
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,370
Go away! Go away!

464
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,230
My master is the only one who can decide if I live or die.

465
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,330
If you don't listen to him,

466
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,330
tens of thousands of ants will come and gnaw at you!

467
00:27:00,170 --> 00:27:00,780
-Go away!
-Behave yourself!

468
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,880
I'm not as easy as Miss Ke.

469
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,320
Miss Ke's a bitch.

470
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,380
She's a bitch!

471
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,010
Go away!

472
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:13,310
This level of insanity means the poison has entered her bone marrow.

473
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,630
There's no time to lose.

474
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:15,700
I knocked her out so it'll be easier to feed her the medicine.

475
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,030
Master. Master.

476
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,330
Miss Tianhu is having crazy outbursts in the room.

477
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,340
Really?

478
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,370
Absolutely.

479
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,240
Go.

480
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,090
How is it?

481
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:57,300
This medicine can only delay the spread of the poison.

482
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:00,280
We have to find a way to force Tang Xiao to hand over the antidote.

483
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,700
Luckily, the competition is about to end.

484
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,970
We're waiting for Yun Xiang to show up.

485
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,380
Did your men bring back any news?

486
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,740
If you hadn't stopped me last night,

487
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,090
I would have been imprisoned

488
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,860
and wouldn't be here to talk to you.

489
00:28:15,250 --> 00:28:15,940
Tell me more.

490
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,550
Last night, Magistrate Shao of Nandu was at Tang's Gambling House.

491
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,290
If I went to stir trouble,

492
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:21,680
I would have been arrested on the spot.

493
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,290
This must be Tang Xiao's serial strategy.

494
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,170
He foresaw that Menglan might not obey his wishes

495
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,360
and knew how you'd react

496
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,190
after finding out about this.

497
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,650
That's why he had an official there

498
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:35,310
waiting for you to walk into the trap.

499
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,700
It's all my fault for not considering the big picture.

500
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,910
You're dealing with a monster like Tang Xiao.

501
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,640
You had no choice.

502
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:48,600
By the way,

503
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,540
Tang Xiao took advantage of Magistrate Shao's presence

504
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,000
to run his business past curfew.

505
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:56,470
In this way, their revenue will be even higher than ours.

506
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:02,890
The competition is going to end at dusk today.

507
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:25,590
[Liansheng House]

508
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,020
[Liansheng House wins, bet-to-payout ratio of 1:6]

509
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,020
[Tang's Gambling House wins, bet-to-payout ratio of 1:3]

510
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:29,630
Bet-to-payout ratio of 1:6?

511
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,540
This payout rate...

512
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,350
What exactly is Liansheng House's plan?

513
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:33,780
Sir,

514
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:34,900
why do you say that?

515
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,260
I heard that the revenue of Tang's Gambling House

516
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,540
is much higher than Liansheng House's.

517
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,350
Yes.

518
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,440
In this situation,

519
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,790
Tang's Gambling House is very likely to win.

520
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,120
But Liansheng House's payout rate is higher.

521
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:46,030
Then, how much money will Liansheng House lose?

522
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:46,470
Everyone,

523
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:50,390
this bet-to-payout ratio of 1:3 is only a base ratio.

524
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:53,190
With time, as more people place their bets,

525
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,880
the payout rate will also increase.

526
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,380
Mr. Su, in order to defeat Tang Xiao,

527
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,550
you're really risking it all.

528
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:01,980
If you set the payout rate randomly like this,

529
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,020
I doubt Liansheng House can last much longer.

530
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,900
Don’t worry.

531
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,500
Liansheng House has the support of the Su family.

532
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,370
We can afford it.

533
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,290
Su Mingyu even swore that

534
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,400
even if he has to spend half of his fortune,

535
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:13,210
he'll fight you to the death.

536
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,240
He won't give up until he wins.

537
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:18,690
We watched Su Mingyu grow up.

538
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:20,460
He has always been polite.

539
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,690
Now he wants to win me in a battle of cruelty.

540
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,170
He's unskilled at it.

541
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,500
How pitiful.

542
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,520
Mr. Tang.

543
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,100
Manager Ke and Tianhu

544
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,290
are under strict surveillance now.

545
00:30:31,670 --> 00:30:33,510
Right now, there's only a few of us left,

546
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,190
but there's nothing much we can do.

547
00:30:35,830 --> 00:30:37,290
If the Su family gets involved again,

548
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:38,020
then we...

549
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,980
Su Mingyu can't represent the Su family.

550
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:45,500
His older sister won’t let him do as he pleases.

551
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:47,700
Master.

552
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:49,630
Even so,

553
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,960
we have to take precautions for Liansheng House's current tactic.

554
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,260
Right now, although we're in the lead in terms of revenue,

555
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,660
according to the accounts,

556
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:57,360
it's still not a guaranteed win.

557
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,730
That's right, Young Master.

558
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,180
It's been less than an hour

559
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,220
since they've changed their payout rate

560
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,020
and they've already earned more than 700 taels.

561
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,730
They couldn't outwit me,

562
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,490
so they are resorting to being unreasonable?

563
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,960
That's not typical of Young Master Xiang's behavior.

564
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,580
Master, do you remember

565
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,890
the recent raw silk incident in Nandu city?

566
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:17,340
Young Master Xiang also relied on the Su family's influence

567
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,730
to defeat Qi Tianfeng.

568
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,810
So he's spurring on the wolf to fight the tiger.

569
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,630
I see.

570
00:31:24,940 --> 00:31:25,990
So,

571
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:29,020
Young Master Xiang knew Ke Menglan was being used by you,

572
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,370
but he just let it be.

573
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,090
Then, in a timely manner,

574
00:31:33,110 --> 00:31:35,450
he let Su Mingyu figure this out by himself.

575
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,290
According to that good-for-nothing's temperament,

576
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:42,180
when Su Mingyu found out that the woman he loves betrayed him

577
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,660
and couldn't vent his anger on her,

578
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:46,210
he'd vent his anger on me.

579
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,380
That's why he's using half of his fortune

580
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,880
to fight with me to the death.

581
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,010
Without using a single soldier.

582
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:58,500
To take his strength and use it against him.

583
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,860
This is an unscrupulous trick.

584
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,850
This is Young Master Xiang's method, indeed.

585
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,340
But even though we've seen through his scheme,

586
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,470
right now,

587
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:11,530
we still have to win first.

588
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:12,980
Of course.

589
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:15,900
Since he's so eager, let's play along with him.

590
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:16,940
Pass down my order.

591
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,920
Let's adjust our Tang's Gambling House's payout rate

592
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:24,150
such that it's exactly the same as Liansheng House's.

593
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:33,790
Here.

594
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,630
Have some.

595
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,600
Didn't your master say

596
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:51,610
you're sick?

597
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,500
Besides medicine,

598
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,100
you also need to eat some food to recover.

599
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,870
This is your favorite eight-treasure porridge.

600
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:09,990
I just made it for you.

601
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,550
It's all my fault for not taking good care of you.

602
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:19,670
That's why you became like this.

603
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,110
Tianhu, I beg you.

604
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,330
Have one more bite.

605
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,180
Menglan.

606
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:31,870
Eat something.

607
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,290
I brought you some snacks.

608
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:39,220
You have to take good care of yourself to take care of her.

609
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,990
Mr. Su, you might as well scold me.

610
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,490
You're wrong.

611
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,550
The one that I hate is me.

612
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:53,680
I failed to protect you well,

613
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,710
so you're put in such a dilemma.

614
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:02,470
Su Mingyu.

615
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,830
It's time. Keep raising the payout rate.

616
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,310
It rose again?

617
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:13,380
It rose again?

618
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:16,330
[Liansheng House wins, bet-to-payout ratio of 1:5]

619

[Tang's Gambling House wins, bet-to-payout ratio of 1:4]

620
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:18,300
Master.

621
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:19,580
Liansheng House's bet-to-payout ratio is at 1:5,

622
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:21,280
while ours is at 1:4.

623
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,280
Adjust it.

624
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:23,929
Yes. Yes.

625
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:31,989
Master...

626
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,030

630
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:46,880
Betting starts now!

631
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:03,890
[Liansheng House]

632
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,140
Mr. Su,

633
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,790
can the payout rate still be adjusted?

634
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,260
Yes, will it be adjusted?

635
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,100
It's dusk.

636
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:06,980
This competition between Liansheng House and Tang's Gambling House

637
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,860
has come to an end.

638
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,820
Mr. Su.

639
00:35:13,890 --> 00:35:15,170
Can Liansheng House win?

640
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,500
Everyone,

641
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,000
to know whether you win or lose,

642
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:20,970
you'll have to wait for the news.

643
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,260
However, Liansheng House could only have persisted until now

644
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,890
because of everyone's support.

645
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,740
Hence, if Liansheng House wins,

646
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,730
10% of the profit will be paid back to you in ten days

647
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,860
as a token of appreciation.

648
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:35,740
10%?

649
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,700
Thank you, Mr. Su. Thank you, Mr. Su.

650
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,790
Today's revenue was more than 9,000 taels.

651
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,820
It's much more than the total amount of the previous days.

652
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,740
Why do you still say we can't win?

653
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:47,260
Tang's Gambling House was monitoring us closely and adjusted accordingly.

654
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,140
Their revenue today would be high too.

655
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,070
The odds are slim.

656
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,090
Does Mr. Yun have any other solution?

657
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,620
They're like a tiny insect trying to shake a tree.

658
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,740
They can't beat Master.

659
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,980
The medicine's effect is gone again.

660
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,290
Miss Shu.

661
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,580
Do you know where Yun is at right now?

662
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,260
How about this?

663
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,290
Take Yun and leave Nandu first.

664
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,790
I'll ask my sister to mediate with Tang Xiao in person.

665
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:23,390
No matter what,

666
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,340
I can't let Yun become a slave at Tang's Residence.

667
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,140
But Jin is still with Tang Xiao.

668
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,160
I don't know what he's doing.

669
00:36:33,570 --> 00:36:34,960
Master, Manager Kang is here.

670
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:36,460
-Mr. Su. -Mr. Kang.

671
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,040
Mr. Yun sent me here to pass on a message.

672
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,380
Right now, the results of the competition have been finalized.

673
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:41,180
It's the perfect time to rescue Ten Taels of Gold.

674
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,300
The results of the competition have been finalized?

675
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,200
Who's the winner?

676
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,300
If you're asking about the competition between the two gambling houses,

677
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,730
Tang's Gambling House is the winner.

678
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,960
If you're asking about the competition

679
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,840
between Mr. Yun and Tang Xiao...

680
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,800
Congratulations, Mr. Tang.

681
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,460
Liansheng House has put an end to the betting.

682
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,270
Qi!

683
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,500
Put an end to the betting!

684
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:12,450
Master.

685
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:14,530
Master.

686
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,110
I was about to put an end to the betting,

687
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,920
but a customer refused vehemently.

688
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,470
He said that bets can still be made if the notice board is not taken down.

689
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,980
He wants to bet 10,000 taels of silver

690
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,580
on the win of Tang's Gambling House.

691
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,990
Mr. Tang. Mr. Tang.

692
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:36,340
Customer,

693
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,340
we're no longer accepting bets.

694
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:38,220
If you still want to play, go somewhere else.

695
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:45,500
If the notice board is still up, bets can still be made.

696
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:47,990
This is the rule.

697
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,230
Mr. Tang, as the industry's leader in Nandu,

698
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:00,640
you wouldn't break the rule yourself, would you?
