The government won't let him go easily.

First,

27
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,579
Mr. Mo and I are not people who strictly abide by the sect rules,

28
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:54,920
but we do act within boundaries.

29
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:59,180
It's never wise to offend the government.

30
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,930
It will only be condemned by the sect.

Second,

32
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,960
are you really going to break in like that,

00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,370
with absolutely no cover-up?

34
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:08,610
If so,

35
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,430
you will only bring trouble upon the sect.

If it is destroyed

40
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,850
because of your impulsive act,

41
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,430
and Mr. Mo is thus down and out

42
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,590
for the rest of his life,

43
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:28,030
maybe he won't blame you,

44
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,079
but will you be able to forgive yourself?

45
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,360
Losing Guanghui Bank is better than losing his life.

I wouldn't destroy what's an important source of support

I'd like to know the details.

00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,420
At first I thought

171
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,150
Xiang was just investigating

Wen Cong's case.

173
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,140
So I approached him

174
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:41,220
and secretly helped him search for clues,

00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,140
that Xiang came to Nandu for something else.

178
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:48,610

179
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:50,640

00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,420
to make Nangong Fang his target.

181
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,810

that you mustn't touch him.

183
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,800
Why is it

184
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,730
that you look worried these days?

00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,280

00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,340
Don't go.

189
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,670
Stay until I'm asleep, OK?

190
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:41,400
OK.

191
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:10,270
[Shao's Study]

192
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:22,500
With so much work to do every day,

193
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:23,560
you must be very tired.

194
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:28,120
What brings you here today, Mr. Su?

195
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,900
There is indeed something personal.

196
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,160
Well... I was wondering

197
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,250
if this painting is Hanshan and Shide

198
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,880
by Mr. Feng Qiu.

199
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,930
You know this painting?

200
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:43,910
Actually,

201
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,520
I have an old friend

202
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,900
who loves this painting very much.

203
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,330
He looked for it for years

204
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,860
before finding out

205
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:53,930
that it's kept in your residence.

206
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:55,910
He dare not come to ask,

207
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,460
so he turned to me for help.

208
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,700
Your friend has good taste.

209
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:02,750
Yes.

210
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,300
This painting is exquisite in brushwork,

211
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:06,910
and vivid in depiction.

212
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,780
It's a real treasure

213
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:11,910
of immense value.

214
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:19,100
I happen to have a banknote of 10,000 taels of silver on me

215
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,000
and wish to place a deposit on this masterpiece.

216
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,410
It's just that my friend is not in Nandu,

217
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,530
and I don't know

218
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,520
when he will be back.

219
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,320
Sounds like a kindred spirit that's hard to find.

220
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,880
When he comes back,

221
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:44,080
I'll be happy to have him over.

222
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:46,120
Thank you for your generosity.

223
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:50,910
That was a personal matter.

224
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,760
There is also a public one,

225
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,960
and I was hoping you could kindly give me some advice.

226
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,480
If it's about Mo Bufan,

227
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,850
there's no need to mention it.

228
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,500
As the new chairman of the Chamber of Commerce,

229
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,450
I'm keen to do something,

230
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,400
as well as help lighten your burden.

231
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,150
Lighten my burden?

232
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:16,340
Yes.

233
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,870
I heard a few days ago

234
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:21,900
that the Treasury had lost 100,000 taels of silver,

235
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,430
and there were only about 70,000 taels found

236
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,960
in Guanghui Bank.

237
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,460
The capital

238
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,360
is expecting to receive tributary silver

239
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,850
and cloth from Nandu in a few days,

240
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,120
but the rest of the lost silver is not yet found.

241
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:37,490
You must be worried too.

242
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,850
I'm willing to make up for the rest of the lost silver

243
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,540
for you.

244
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,660
But... even if I make up for it,

245
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,570
you can't close the case.

246
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,820
Mo Bufan keeps saying

247
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,930
that Tang Xiao framed him.

248
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:58,970
But Tang Xiao

249
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,860
was never able to come and confront him.

250
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:03,140
I'm not sure what to do.

251
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:06,280
How about this?

252
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,650
I'll send people to catch the real burglar.

253
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,330
This way Mo Bufan will prove his innocence,

254
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,010
and Tang Xiao won't have to get involved.

255
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,680
Then you can make up for the lost silver,

256
00:16:19,850 --> 00:16:22,410
and the case will be closed.

257
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,630
Thank you so much for your help.

258
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,560
Hang in there. We're almost there.

259
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:31,860
Almost there.

260
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,480
How much did it cost?

261
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,220
What did you say?

262
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,650
How much did it cost to get me out of the hands

263
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,370
of that corrupt official?

264
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,470
Gently!

265
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,100
Be careful.

266
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,210
Be careful.

267
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:42,660
Be careful.

268
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,450
Just tell me.

269
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:48,440
How much did it cost?

270
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:51,780
Thirty-five thousand taels.

271
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:52,520
Thirty...

272
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:58,030
Thirty-five... thousand taels?

273
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,730
Why didn't you just let him kill me?

274
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,270
Mr. Mo must have lost his head in pain.

275
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,599
Please don't take offense.

276
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,339
Guanghui Bank lost a lot this time.

277
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,800
I have paid the 35,000 taels for you, as a loan.

278
00:17:12,450 --> 00:17:12,950
Mr. Mo,

279
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:14,430
I'll give you 6 months to pay it back.

280
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:15,750
You can take your time.

281
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:16,819
It's interest-free.

282
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:21,720
Fine.

283
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,109
Mr. Su,

284
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,420
I have two favors to ask.

285
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,010
Go ahead, Mr. Mo.

286
00:17:28,610 --> 00:17:29,540
First,

287
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,210
please thank Chairman Su for me.

288
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:35,830
Second,

289
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,500
tell Yun Xiang...

290
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,310
Tell Yun Xiang...

291
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,460
Tell Yun Xiang to come and see me!

292
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,340
Uncle,

293
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,660
Mr. Su has taken over the position of chairman.

294
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,250
What?

295
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:50,150
Mr. Mo,

296
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,320
I'll inform Mr. Yun when I get back.

297
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,580
You should rest well.

298
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,250
Uncle.

299
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,860
Are you alright?

300
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,290
Tell me what happened

301
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,320
while I was away.

302
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,120
[Liansheng House]

303
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,260
Right.

304
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,380
Here we are.

305
00:18:15,810 --> 00:18:17,590
You've been laughing all the way,

306
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,900
but you don't seem tired at all.

307
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,740
Let's get out now.

308
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,000
Let's go.

309
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:26,600
Come here.

310
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,410
Come on out.

311
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:45,720
Call me "boss."

312
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,070
Listen,

313
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,730
we're in our own place now.

314
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,800
Once you guys have settled in,

315
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,270
we'll treat you to steamed buns.

316
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,610
Call me "boss" and I'll get out.

317
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:00,390
Jiabao.

318
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,030
I only listen to Tianhu.

319
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:09,810
Looks like I've got an admirer,

320
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,440
right?

321
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,180
Brat.

322
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:12,910
Let's go.

323
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,110
Dealing with the government

324
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,170
is more tiring than fighting with the robbers.

325
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:24,380
You have to weigh your words

326
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:28,340
while trying to figure out what he really means

327
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,190
by his words.

328
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,810
You also have to find a way to be polite

329
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,870
which doesn't disgust yourself.

330
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,290
That's how the government is.

331
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,350
It's really hard to make them

332
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:44,030
release someone.

333
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,260
You did very well this time.

334
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,580
I'm only realizing now

335
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,490
how hard it was for my sister.

336
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,720
I was only dealing with Magistrate Shao,

337
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,020
and I'm exhausted.

338
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,360
My sister had to deal with so many departments

339
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,820
for the prosperity of the family.

340
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:08,050
All those offices,

341
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,590
and all those officials,

342
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,680
she had to attend to every one of them.

343
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:16,450
Mingyu,

344
00:20:17,570 --> 00:20:18,570
these things

345
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,630
must have made you feel out of your depth.

346
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:23,500
But you've been

347
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,540
exposed to business strategies since you were little,

348
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:29,280
and you know how to deal with the government.

349
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,650
You really did very well this time.

350
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,510
Don't worry. I'll be with you.

351
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,130
Let's take our time, OK?

352
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:49,890
How is Mr. Mo?

353
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,090
He's OK,

354
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,440
but was injured here.

355
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:53,520
He can only lie on his stomach.

356
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:56,980
Mr. Yun,

357
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:01,830
I've informed Mr. Mo of what happened in the past few days.

358
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:03,460
But...

359
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:06,580
But not your plan to break into the jail?

360
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,520
It's in the past now.

361
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,460
No need to mention it.

362
00:21:12,370 --> 00:21:13,150
Thank you.

363
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,790
Didn't I tell you

364
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:25,640
to keep a low profile?

365
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:26,280
But you're

366
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,490
causing trouble everywhere!

367
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,920
Calm down. Lie still.

368
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:31,740
This pain is nothing

369
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,860
compared to my heartache.

370
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,110
You had a great fight with Tang Xiao,

371
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:40,170
but I lost over 100,000 taels of silver!

372
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:40,980
Mr. Mo,

373
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,510
you've suffered a lot this time.

374
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,220
But since we're both serving the sect...

375
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:45,710
Stop.

376
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,980
"Serving the sect"?

377
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,050
How do you even have the gall to say that?

378
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,700
Kang Qiao, go ahead

379
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,510
and get some paper and a writing brush.

380
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:56,050
I'll let Master decide

381
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,240
if he's turning Nandu upside down

382
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,360
for the sect or for himself!

383
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:04,230
Go!

384
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,030
Mr. Mo.

385
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,360
Calm down.

386
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,340
I do think it's time now

387
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:15,990
to report everything to Master.

388
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,570
What are you up to now?

389
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:20,930
I have learned from Su Huairou

390
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,300
the truth about the east-coast

391
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,160
land purchase case 15 years ago.

392
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,510
According to her,

393
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:28,070
it was a member of the Lingyuan Sect

394
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,750
who plotted it for Su Linghe.

395
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:34,440
She was just afraid that you would retaliate against her,

396
00:22:35,110 --> 00:22:35,990
so she made a scapegoat

397
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:37,660
of someone you can't mess with.

398
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:39,890
Maybe...

399
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:41,790
Or maybe not.

400
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:43,660
Lingyuan used to use force to create chaos,

401
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,670
but they have frequently intervened

402
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,150
in business affairs in recent years.

403
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,510
Have you ever thought that maybe they have changed?

404
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,820
And maybe they had already changed

405
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:52,960
fifteen years ago?

406
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:54,900
Yuntai and Lingyuan

407
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,410
have been fighting for over a century.

408
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,770
If some of the Lingyuan people got smart

409
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:01,260
and started to imitate us,

410
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:02,660
I wouldn't be surprised.

411
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:05,080
If that's the case,

412
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,190
the sect should have noticed it.

413
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,050
Indeed.

414
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,220
That's what confuses me.

415
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:12,260
We'll keep it to ourselves for now.

416
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,770
Don't report it to Master.

417
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:15,870
Mr. Mo,

418
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,730
from Tang Xiao's death

419
00:23:18,370 --> 00:23:20,150
to you being framed in the Treasury burglary case,

420
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,650
Lingyuan must have been behind all this.

421
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,850
It's their blatant provocation.

422
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,570
We will have to fight them,

423
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,110
so why not get prepared in advance?

424
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,160
Do as I said.

425
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,610
I'll explain it to you in due course.

426
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,360
This small Guanghui Bank of mine

427
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,680
was only in charge of passing on information for the sect.

428
00:23:41,690 --> 00:23:43,840
I didn't want to be involved in anything else.

429
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:47,450
But now they are messing with me

430
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,510
and getting their hands on my money.

431
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,150
Fine.

432
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,410
Since they have dared to play with fire,

433
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:58,530
I'll be sure to teach them a lesson.

434
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,540
[Ling Yan, Lingyuan Sect]

435
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:18,730
Sir,

436
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,660
it's an urgent message from Mr. Ye of Nandu.

437
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,690
Young Master stole from the Treasury and framed Yuntai.

438
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,370
Mr. Ye is afraid that things might get out of control

439
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,670
and seeks your advice.

440
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:30,220
He stole from the Treasury and framed Yuntai?

441
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,840
Young Master is getting better and better

442
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:35,790
at kissing the child for the nurse's sake.

443
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:38,080
My reply is

444
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,290
"It's OK."

445
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:47,690
Captain,

446
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,140
Mr. Nangong has replied.

447
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,930
[It's OK.]

448
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:57,210
"It's OK"?

449
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,120
Does he mean there's no need to interfere?

450
00:24:59,690 --> 00:25:00,730
By these few words

451
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,920
he means we shouldn't bother him with such trivial matters,

452
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,010
but should make our own decision.

453
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,660
Young Master came to Nandu.

454
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:13,940
It will be my fault if things go wrong.

455
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:15,880
Captain,

456
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,130
Young Master has left through the west gate with his bodyguard.

457
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,620
They're carrying luggage

458
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,710
and probably going on a long trip.

459
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,680
Are you sure?

460
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:22,650
Yes.

461
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:23,670
Let's go.

462
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,420
I'll watch him cross the river.

463
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,950
[The day of tributary silver's departure for the capital]

464
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,700
Make sure you check every box.

465
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,380
We must depart on time.

466
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,320
What a nuisance!

467
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:20,080
Young Master, why did you leave without saying goodbye?

468
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,570
If I had known you were leaving,

469
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:24,940
I would have held a farewell banquet for you.

470
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:27,000
Sit.

471
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,710
So the government just released Mo Bufan like that?

472
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:38,680
I heard that

473
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,590
the Su family interceded for him

474
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,700
and spent tens of thousands of taels of silver

475
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:44,830
to get Mo Bufan out of the jail.

476
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,180
But Mo Bufan

477
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,420
did suffer a lot in there.

478
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,440
Young Master, you've at least given him a warning.

479
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,910
The Su family is the leading merchant in Nandu.

480
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,880
Now they are so close to Mr. Xiang.

481
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,460
Looks like Yuntai has established

482
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,810
a solid foundation in Nandu.

483
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:05,950
It's OK.

484
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,120
It surely is.

485
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,720
Isn't Mr. Nangong setting things up?

486
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:13,430
We'll subdue them sooner or later.

487
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:14,680
Young Master,

488
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,090
it was us who were appointed

489
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,900
by Master to manage the commerce in Jiangnan.

490
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:28,930
All set?

491
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,260
Mr. Ye,

492
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:38,110
there's no point in discussing these things.

493
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,400
Every August,

494
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,520
tributary silver from Nandu goes up north along the canal.

495
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,730
If you're here to bid me farewell,

496
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,250
why don't you watch us fight a battle?

497
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,970
Why did you kill the messenger?

498
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:10,020
Mr. Ye,

499
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,510
those tricks that Mr. Nangong copied from Yuntai

500
00:28:13,530 --> 00:28:15,040
are really very clumsy.

501
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:19,180
Lingyuan should have our own way.

502
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:21,880
I'll give Mr. Nangong a surprise.

503
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:23,010
So long!

504
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,020
Captain, do we follow him now?

505
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,640
Forget it.

506
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,590
He's determined to defeat me.

[A relay station's dock on the canal]

511
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:08,510
Just hang in there.

512
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,220
It's going to be over after tonight.

513
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:12,740
Although the warrant is here,

514
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,930
no one has told us when the ship will depart.

515
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,780
I wonder where the hell the messenger is.

516
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,070
It's getting late,

517
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,160
but there's no sign of the ships.

518
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,450
What are you afraid of?

519
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:25,650
We're in a time of peace and plenty,

520
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,800
and not in the past, when there were pirates.

521
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:59,940
Where did the boat come from?

522
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,380
There're no lights on it.

523
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:02,460
Wait.

524
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,420
It's an official boat for transporting tributary silver.

525
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,570
The house stood empty for many years.

526
00:30:18,730 --> 00:30:19,770
I hope you don't mind.

527

If we can modify the layout of the courtyard,

528
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,100
this will be a perfect place for a foundling home.

529
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:30,590
To let such a big house stand empty...

00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:37,870

532
00:30:38,330 --> 00:30:39,680
You should be thankful to Mr. Su.

533

Crouch down!

539
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:57,810
Since you need to hold a sword,

540
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,060
it's more convenient this way.

541
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,430
Let's see if I can catch you!

542
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:03,520
I'll catch you!

Jin,

544
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,130
he seems to be a special one.

545
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,170
Is he from Jishan Hall as well?

546
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,580
Once, I was besieged by my enemies

547
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:18,670
and was seriously injured.

His father saved me.

549
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,180
Later, his father went out to battle.

550
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,050
I haven't heard from him for years.

that we found him this time.

554
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,970
It was the least I could do.

555
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,930
I haven't seen him for years.

556
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:46,730
He looks exactly like his father.

557
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,320
I had never looked up to anyone in my life

558
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,430
until I met his father.

559
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,530
That explains it.

560
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:57,460
Jin even gets scared

561
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,760
when Jiabao stares at him.

562
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,630
I'm not good with words of gratitude.

563
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,640
If there're things I can help with

564
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,320
at the Chamber of Commerce,

565
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,140
just let me know.

566
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,240
Hopefully there won't be any.

567
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:15,490
It will save all of us trouble.

568
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:26,250
Boss,

569
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,200
what would you like for dinner?

570
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,880
I want to have steamed pork buns made by Tianhu!

571
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:32,920
Yes!

572
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,640
Steamed pork buns made by Tianhu!

573
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,350
No problem. We'll make them when we get back.

574
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,570
You're going to help me.

575
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:40,120
Come and have a look.

576
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,090
I like this.

577
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:41,950
This one?

578
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,710
I want this one.

579
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,120
This one looks good too.

580
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,110
They're all pretty.

581
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:48,860
I like this one.

582
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,150
Jin,

583
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,870
tell all your friends,

584
00:32:54,290 --> 00:32:55,300
orphans

585
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,980
and unattended children are all welcome here.

586
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,370
We'll sponsor it.

587
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,530
They can stay here for the next few years.

588
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,430
We'll figure something out when they grow up.

589
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:11,420
We need to find kind and patient people

590
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,860
to be in charge of their future education.

591
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:15,670
Sure, as long as it's good for the kids.

592
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:19,990
Out the way!

593
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,180
Out of the way! Emergency order from the government!

594
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,530
Emergency order from the government!

595
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:26,660
Out the way!

596
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:32,680
Emergency order from Nandu and Jiangnan Government Offices

597
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,070
to close markets and borders!

598
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,090
Close borders?

599
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,630
[Qing'an Gate]

600
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,980
Why did they close the gate in the middle of the day?

601
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:02,640
Waiter.

602
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,550
Coming!

603
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:06,930
What's going on?

604
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,860
Why is the gate closed in the middle of the day?

605
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,510
I don't know exactly.

606
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,000
There're all kinds of rumors.

607
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,530
Anyway, it's the same in all of the towns around here.

608
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,350
The city opens at 5 a.m. and closes at 7 p.m.

609
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,010
according to the law.

610
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,580
There should be a reason for closing the city during the day.

611
00:34:23,989 --> 00:34:24,489
A reason?

612
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,840
I really don't know.

613
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:28,730
Maybe you could try

614
00:34:29,219 --> 00:34:30,449
and listen to those guys over there.

615
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,639
The official silver

616
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,949
was lost and then found half a month ago.

617
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:35,889
But then they lost it again.

618
00:34:36,010 --> 00:34:37,120
It's so strange.

619
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,840
You really don't know what it was?

620
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:42,150
No, what was it?

621
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:44,070
It was the water ghost!

622
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,639
Water ghost?

623
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:48,980
The water ghost used a trick called "Five Ghosts Moving Mountains"

624
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,739
to rob the government's treasury.

625
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:53,060
Mr. Shao had to ask a Taoist priest

626
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,150
to suppress it with the official seal

627
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,480
and got the money back.

628
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,940
So what's this now?

629
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,660
The water ghost has done it again?

630
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,850
It's said that a fisherman saw a water ghost

631
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:04,620
get on a boat

632
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:07,100
and eat all the soldiers last night.

633
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,210
Really? That's so creepy!

634
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,300
Yeah, exactly.

635
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,250
If so,

636
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:15,080
why don't they just ask that Taoist priest

637
00:35:15,590 --> 00:35:17,180
to help get the money back again?

638
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:19,390
Why are they making such a fuss?

639
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,060
Is it that the water ghost might run away

640
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,650
or that the Taoist priest might go on retreat?

641
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,250
What do you know?

642
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:26,610
If it's not the water ghost,

643
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,470
then how did all the money disappear?

644
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,970
-Yeah. -Exactly.

645
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Arrest them all!

646
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:32,940
Yes, sir!

Spreading rumors.

648

This guy, this, this and that one.

649
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,780
Arrest them all!

650
00:35:37,810 --> 00:35:38,400
Stop!

651
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,120
Don't move!

652
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,080
What?

653
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,020
Despite such a serious case,

654
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:47,130
you're arresting people for no reason

655
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:48,070
instead of soothing them.

656
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,720
What reason is there?

657
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:50,950
Reason?

658
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,770
I am the reason!

659
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,850

660
00:35:55,270 --> 00:35:56,740

662
00:35:58,980 --> 00:35:59,840

I'm just following that.

676
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,910

Uncle,

678
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,390
looks like your prestige is not very helpful.

679
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:46,700
If being an imperial guard is not enough,

680
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,370
what about being a princess?

681
