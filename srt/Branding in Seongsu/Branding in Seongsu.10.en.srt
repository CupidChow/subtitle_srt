You.

Oh, my gosh! What is going on?

6
00:00:26,805 --> 00:00:28,905
Goodness. I will keep this a secret.

7
00:00:29,204 --> 00:00:31,045
- Hold on. - Jenny and Lex.

8
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:33,375
- What is it? - Wait.

9
00:00:34,015 --> 00:00:35,045
- Oh, my. - Oh, my.

10
00:00:35,244 --> 00:00:37,713
You two are amazing!

11
00:00:37,714 --> 00:00:39,684
- Those two are really... - Goodness.

12
00:00:39,685 --> 00:00:41,724
- Don't take pictures! - What are you doing?

13
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:43,484
- My goodness. - What do we do?

14
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:45,124
That's just amazing!

15
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,724
- Hold on. - Get up, will you?

16
00:00:46,725 --> 00:00:49,224
- Give me the key. - Here.

17
00:00:49,225 --> 00:00:51,865
- My gosh. - Hurry up and unlock it!

18
00:00:52,464 --> 00:00:53,795
What are you doing?

19
00:00:55,505 --> 00:00:56,533
What is it?

20
00:00:56,534 --> 00:00:57,733
This is so embarrassing.

21
00:00:57,734 --> 00:00:59,033
Gosh, that hurts!

22
00:00:59,034 --> 00:01:00,404
What? Where have they all gone?

23
00:01:00,405 --> 00:01:03,544
Hurry up and unlock it! This just isn't right.

24
00:01:03,705 --> 00:01:07,314
- I got it. - My purity!

25
00:01:07,315 --> 00:01:09,044

You can just make a call.

30
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:53,694
Why are you making me come all the way here?

31
00:01:53,695 --> 00:01:55,925
Why are you in such a hurry?

32
00:01:57,994 --> 00:01:58,994
Here.

00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:02,834
Let's just have a drink and...

34
00:02:02,835 --> 00:02:04,134
I'm not in a hurry.

35
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:07,175
I just don't want to waste my time.

36
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:10,814
If it isn't anything important, I'll get going.

37
00:02:12,444 --> 00:02:13,444
Kang Na Eon!

38
00:02:17,955 --> 00:02:20,585
I believe you're going through a lot of stress because of her.

39
00:02:27,194 --> 00:02:28,825
With just a phone call,

40
00:02:29,295 --> 00:02:31,335
Director Han might solve things for you.

41

What is it?

42
00:02:39,605 --> 00:02:41,805
Do I look all amazing to you now?

43
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:47,214
Hey!

44
00:02:48,485 --> 00:02:49,515
Darn it.

45
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:52,184
Don't get ahead of yourself.

46
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:54,325
Kang Na Eon?

47
00:02:54,855 --> 00:02:56,555
I will take care of her myself.

48
00:03:08,305 --> 00:03:09,504
Thanks for the drink.

49
00:03:11,705 --> 00:03:12,705
Hey!

50
00:03:13,705 --> 00:03:14,805
Gosh.

51
00:03:15,244 --> 00:03:18,045
That rude witch. She thinks she's someone great.

52
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:46,504
The products here are better than I thought.

53
00:03:46,774 --> 00:03:48,244
- Yes. - Right.

54
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,414
If you take a look, the products are perfectly made...

55
00:03:51,415 --> 00:03:52,874
for a woman's body.

56
00:03:53,075 --> 00:03:54,844
For both pleasure and comfort.

57
00:03:56,244 --> 00:03:58,854
The products aren't the issue for their weak sales.

58
00:03:58,855 --> 00:04:00,925
It seems to be an issue with the concept.

59
00:04:01,224 --> 00:04:03,355
The location is set up like a maze, leading to bad accessibility.

60
00:04:03,825 --> 00:04:06,055
I see. Understood.

61
00:04:09,994 --> 00:04:11,064
But...

62
00:04:12,434 --> 00:04:15,305
it is quite tough to live as a girl.

63
00:04:16,634 --> 00:04:18,604
There are many things to hide,

64
00:04:18,605 --> 00:04:19,975
along with many inconveniences.

65
00:04:21,975 --> 00:04:24,975
Na Eon. Get me some sanitary pads.

66
00:04:25,314 --> 00:04:26,614
You can get them yourself.

67
00:04:26,615 --> 00:04:28,384
Oh, come on!

68
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,814
It's quite embarrassing to get them myself.

69
00:04:34,384 --> 00:04:37,225
Oh, right.

70
00:04:37,555 --> 00:04:40,025
At this point, it makes sense for me to get them.

71
00:04:42,494 --> 00:04:43,564
I'll be back.

72
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:49,064
- Welcome. - Hello.

73
00:05:00,514 --> 00:05:02,384
Oh, come on.

74
00:05:02,715 --> 00:05:05,555
Why would they keep these important things down here?

75
00:05:07,254 --> 00:05:09,124
(Cover pads, small, Cover pads, medium)

76
00:05:13,394 --> 00:05:14,465
(Cover pads, small)

77
00:05:14,824 --> 00:05:16,425
All right.

78
00:05:25,134 --> 00:05:27,844
Oh, Jenny. Don't worry about me.

79
00:05:27,845 --> 00:05:29,704
Just go ahead and... I mean...

80
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:31,915
Hi, Ms. Kang.

81
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:33,874
Good thing you're here.

82
00:05:34,275 --> 00:05:35,915
Have you tried these?

83
00:05:37,985 --> 00:05:39,155
Which one is better?

84
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,024
Jenny! There are people watching.

85
00:05:48,025 --> 00:05:50,064
You're embarrassing me.

86
00:05:51,494 --> 00:05:52,535
What?

87
00:05:54,365 --> 00:05:55,634
What's wrong?

88
00:05:56,105 --> 00:05:57,975
It's not like it's illegal or anything.

89
00:06:00,975 --> 00:06:02,605
I should go with King today.

90
00:06:04,514 --> 00:06:05,574
Bye!

91
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:10,744
She's right.

92
00:06:13,355 --> 00:06:16,485
There's nothing wrong about it.

93
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:48,684
What's this?

94
00:06:55,194 --> 00:06:56,264
Gosh.

95
00:06:57,425 --> 00:06:59,595
What has he done now?

96
00:07:18,115 --> 00:07:20,514
He has made this place a botanical garden.

97
00:07:23,525 --> 00:07:24,555
Hey, Eun Ho.

98
00:07:26,795 --> 00:07:27,795
Eun Ho?

99
00:07:30,624 --> 00:07:31,665
Where is he?

100
00:07:33,465 --> 00:07:34,465
Eun Ho.

101
00:07:37,704 --> 00:07:38,735
Eun Ho!

102
00:07:40,305 --> 00:07:41,374
Hey!

103
00:07:42,905 --> 00:07:44,514
This punk!

104
00:07:48,644 --> 00:07:49,785
Darn it.

105
00:07:52,985 --> 00:07:54,554
I'm sorry for the late notice.

106
00:07:54,555 --> 00:07:56,724
But please get to work an hour earlier than usual.

107
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:58,155
Thanks!

108
00:07:59,454 --> 00:08:02,024
I'm going through a subway jam.

109
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:05,535
I have to send my kids to daycare...

110
00:08:06,665 --> 00:08:08,434
before getting to work.

111
00:08:09,305 --> 00:08:12,433
I'm stuck in the elevator.

112
00:08:12,434 --> 00:08:14,333
Sorry about that.

113
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:16,944
Then I'll see everyone at our usual time.

114
00:08:17,545 --> 00:08:20,275
Why is he talking like that?

115
00:08:26,555 --> 00:08:27,683
He's not even picking up.

116
00:08:27,684 --> 00:08:29,954
What is he up to now?

117
00:08:31,084 --> 00:08:32,093
Hey, So Eun...

118
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,794
Yes, hello?

119
00:08:33,795 --> 00:08:35,563
Yes.

120
00:08:35,564 --> 00:08:38,364
I'm wondering if that date is possible.

121
00:08:38,665 --> 00:08:40,233
You should have told me first!

122
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:42,603
Would that be possible?

123
00:08:42,604 --> 00:08:44,404
Oh, you're here.

124
00:08:44,405 --> 00:08:45,804
I see.

125
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:47,035
Yes, thank you.

126
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:48,305
What is...

127
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:50,604
all this?

128
00:08:56,214 --> 00:08:57,545
(Girlish Branding Concept)

129
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:08,765
(I'm sorry for making you use it in secret.)

130
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,934
(I'll become more confident now.)

131
00:09:30,214 --> 00:09:32,484
Living as a woman.

132
00:09:32,854 --> 00:09:35,484
I believe there are many restrictions for women.

133
00:09:36,885 --> 00:09:39,425
Even more for a woman's sex life.

134
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:45,864
So we've thought of it like this.

135
00:09:46,334 --> 00:09:48,304
Instead of tabooing...

136
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:50,833
and keeping a woman's sex life a secret,

137
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:52,704
we've decided to go with the opposite approach.

138
00:09:54,675 --> 00:09:58,014
The products you deal with...

139
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,774
are of high quality...

140
00:09:59,775 --> 00:10:02,714
and have passed all safety requirements.

141
00:10:03,045 --> 00:10:08,255
We're trying to take advantage of the weakness...

142
00:10:08,425 --> 00:10:10,785
that adult toys must be kept hidden.

143
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:13,555
What are you saying?

144
00:10:16,364 --> 00:10:17,925
Are you telling me to get...

145
00:10:18,964 --> 00:10:21,434
straight black hair?

146
00:10:27,104 --> 00:10:28,104
Yes.

147
00:10:28,275 --> 00:10:30,175
You must be insane.

148
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:33,344
Oh, well...

149
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:38,385
The brand identity that the consumers perceive...

150
00:10:40,714 --> 00:10:45,025
must be one with your image.

151
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:54,833
So, as the brand image gets popularized...

152
00:10:54,834 --> 00:10:59,304
your image must also look professional.

153
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:00,973
That's our goal.

154
00:11:00,974 --> 00:11:02,005
- Yes. - Right.

155
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:07,175
Excuse me!

156
00:11:08,915 --> 00:11:11,045
Straight black hair for me?

157
00:11:15,684 --> 00:11:16,785
It's perfect for me.

158
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:21,025
Then...

159
00:11:21,495 --> 00:11:23,364
I guess I'll give it a try.

160
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:27,895
Yes!

161
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:29,963
- We did it! - Yes!

162
00:11:29,964 --> 00:11:31,505
Thank you so much.

163
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:33,104
Great job.

164
00:11:33,675 --> 00:11:34,775
Amazing!

165
00:11:37,005 --> 00:11:39,314
I'm so excited! Gosh.

166
00:11:42,314 --> 00:11:43,385
Awesome.

167
00:11:44,645 --> 00:11:48,285
Jenny! I'm so excited.

168
00:11:50,724 --> 00:11:54,094
Make my hair as straight as possible.

169
00:12:14,745 --> 00:12:16,583
This is amazing!

170
00:12:16,584 --> 00:12:18,714
You can see everything inside.

171
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:21,114
- Let's... - Let's...

172
00:12:32,364 --> 00:12:33,394
Let's go with this place.

173
00:12:33,395 --> 00:12:35,604
It looks amazing!

174
00:12:36,165 --> 00:12:38,433
Sweetheart, that's just too small.

175
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:40,374
You can't see a thing. We must be able to read it.

176
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:42,774
Bring the size up. Use all that space you have.

177
00:12:42,775 --> 00:12:44,274
I told you it needs to be bigger.

178
00:12:44,275 --> 00:12:47,313
It has to have something that can really catch your eye.

179
00:12:47,314 --> 00:12:49,415
Oh, my goodness. What a surprise.

180
00:12:49,684 --> 00:12:50,785
Mr. Cha.

181
00:12:51,515 --> 00:12:52,515
Good luck.

182
00:12:53,354 --> 00:12:54,484
- Don't leave. - Thank you.

183
00:12:54,785 --> 00:12:55,983
Don't leave us.

184
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,885
- Don't leave us. - Sweetheart, we have work to do.

185
00:12:58,324 --> 00:13:00,823
If you make it that big, nothing will work!

186
00:13:00,824 --> 00:13:03,194
- Just do it like... - You just told me to!

187
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:05,165
Gosh.

188
00:13:06,795 --> 00:13:07,895
Hey, Cha Jung Woo.

189
00:13:10,535 --> 00:13:11,704
Hey!

190
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:18,444
Have you decided to ignore me?

191
00:13:19,814 --> 00:13:21,145
You won't even reply to my messages.

192
00:13:21,785 --> 00:13:25,314
I just don't know what you want to hear from me,

193
00:13:26,285 --> 00:13:27,314
Ms. Do.

194
00:13:30,385 --> 00:13:31,625
Kang Na Eon.

195
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:34,093
No matter how much you want it,

196
00:13:34,094 --> 00:13:35,864
she will never get back to how she used to be.

197
00:13:36,594 --> 00:13:37,894
She will become an abandoned dog...

198
00:13:37,895 --> 00:13:39,363
after being tossed here and there at Underdog.

199
00:13:39,364 --> 00:13:40,864
I will make her become like that!

200
00:13:46,974 --> 00:13:48,035
Hey!

201
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,255
What is it?

202
00:14:03,084 --> 00:14:05,453
Must I know what Kang Na Eon's concept is...

203
00:14:05,454 --> 00:14:06,724
for the pop-up store?

204
00:14:07,224 --> 00:14:09,765
Just stop her from doing anything!

205
00:14:20,775 --> 00:14:21,844
It's me.

206
00:14:22,944 --> 00:14:24,545
I will need more budget.

207
00:14:26,114 --> 00:14:27,474
I must trample on the roots...

208
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:29,344
of Kang Na Eon.

209
00:14:34,814 --> 00:14:35,824
What?

210
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:37,584
What is this?

211
00:14:37,724 --> 00:14:39,824
What's going on?

212
00:14:39,925 --> 00:14:41,795
What is all this?

213
00:14:45,895 --> 00:14:48,135
I apologize.

214
00:14:48,464 --> 00:14:50,504
They're giving a better offer.

215
00:14:50,505 --> 00:14:51,574
What else can we do?

216
00:14:51,734 --> 00:14:55,474
Or you can perhaps offer us for more rent.

217
00:14:56,704 --> 00:14:58,444
Who took the place?

218
00:14:59,275 --> 00:15:02,613
Was it Team One of Seongsu Agency?

219
00:15:02,614 --> 00:15:03,684
What?

220
00:15:04,145 --> 00:15:05,885
That just gave me goosebumps.

221
00:15:08,285 --> 00:15:09,425
I can't believe it.

222
00:15:15,864 --> 00:15:17,664
What do we do?

223
00:15:17,665 --> 00:15:19,094
What is all this?

224
00:15:20,165 --> 00:15:22,334
I was wondering why things were working out so well.

225
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:24,703
Our pop-up store has to start tomorrow.

226
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:25,704
What do we do?

227
00:15:30,574 --> 00:15:32,613
D-1!

228
00:15:32,614 --> 00:15:34,943
Seongsu Intersection's secret pop-up store.

229
00:15:34,944 --> 00:15:36,284
Coming soon!

230
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:38,284
I can't believe this girl.

231
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:40,784
She always causes a fuss at the worst time.

232
00:15:40,785 --> 00:15:41,854
Oh, gosh.

233
00:15:42,454 --> 00:15:44,125
Let's look for a different place as quickly as possible.

234
00:15:44,954 --> 00:15:47,654
What other place would accept our concept?

235
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:49,924
They all just freaked out and hung up...

236
00:15:49,925 --> 00:15:51,394
upon hearing just the "S" of "sex toys."

237
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:52,494
Keep it down.

238
00:15:52,495 --> 00:15:54,295
It's so embarrassing.

239
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:57,505
Gosh, my stomach.

240
00:15:57,506 --> 00:15:59,905
Why does my stomach have to hurt at this very moment?

241
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:01,375
Gosh!

242
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:04,905
That's because you're downing a large size coffee.

243
00:16:05,675 --> 00:16:08,944
You don't have to be saying things right by my ear.

244
00:16:10,484 --> 00:16:11,515
This won't do.

245
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:13,554
I'll get some medicine from the pharmacy.

246
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:14,854
- Sure. - Gosh, my stomach.

247
00:16:15,285 --> 00:16:16,624
Why is it hurting so much?

248
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:20,193
The pharmacy over there on the first floor is closed.

249
00:16:20,194 --> 00:16:22,624
You have to go to the one down there by the station.

250
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:23,995
I'm really sorry.

251
00:16:24,265 --> 00:16:26,334
- My stomach. - Good luck.

252
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:30,604
Na Eon!

253
00:16:31,204 --> 00:16:33,675
What do we do? Are we totally done for?

254
00:16:34,305 --> 00:16:35,344
Totally done for?

255
00:16:35,474 --> 00:16:37,244
I asked you first.

256
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:38,275
Are we totally...

257
00:16:39,314 --> 00:16:41,915
I'm asking if the pharmacy closed because they were done for.

258
00:16:44,015 --> 00:16:46,914
Well, I guess so.

259
00:16:46,915 --> 00:16:49,254
It wasn't one that was by a clinic, so...

260
00:16:49,255 --> 00:16:50,255
Okay.

261
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:53,353
What's okay?

262
00:16:53,354 --> 00:16:54,525
Don't leave me!

263
00:16:56,324 --> 00:16:58,593
Gosh. Where are you going?

264
00:16:58,594 --> 00:16:59,795
Come on.

265
00:17:00,334 --> 00:17:01,394
What are you up to now?

266
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:03,264
Gosh.

267
00:17:03,265 --> 00:17:05,374
My gosh. I can't...

268
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:08,805
Who is it?

269
00:17:09,344 --> 00:17:10,444
Hello?

270
00:17:10,445 --> 00:17:12,143
The pharmacy that closed down by Seongsu Intersection.

271
00:17:12,144 --> 00:17:13,515
Please find the contact details of the owner of that building.

272
00:17:13,775 --> 00:17:14,844
Sorry?

273
00:17:16,114 --> 00:17:17,343
This punk.

274
00:17:17,344 --> 00:17:19,153
Always hanging up like that.

275
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:20,185
Gosh, my stomach.

276
00:17:21,015 --> 00:17:22,054
Darn it.

277
00:17:22,055 --> 00:17:23,124
What?

278
00:17:23,255 --> 00:17:27,055
You're planning to open the store where the pharmacy was?

279
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,564
A pharmacy is designed to let everyone look inside...

280
00:17:30,824 --> 00:17:33,134
to look reliable to others.

281
00:17:33,864 --> 00:17:36,363
I guess that pharmacy was also designed...

282
00:17:36,364 --> 00:17:37,965
with picture windows.

283
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:41,234
But it hasn't been long since that pharmacy has closed.

284
00:17:41,235 --> 00:17:42,245
The interior design is...

285
00:17:45,374 --> 00:17:46,814
Kang Na Eon, you're a genius.

286
00:17:49,344 --> 00:17:51,245
- Are you done with your coffee? - What?

287
00:17:53,384 --> 00:17:54,455
Throw this away for me.

288
00:17:56,555 --> 00:17:57,624
You're evil!

289
00:18:06,164 --> 00:18:10,104
(Pharmacy)

290
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:25,654
Gosh.

291
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,025
Na Eon.

292
00:18:31,624 --> 00:18:34,555
Will this work?

293
00:18:35,965 --> 00:18:37,424
We have to make it work.

294
00:18:42,634 --> 00:18:43,634
Gosh.

295
00:18:45,005 --> 00:18:46,975
(Manager Lee Young Ae)

296
00:18:47,975 --> 00:18:48,975
Yes, Young Ae.

297
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:53,574
What do we do?

298
00:18:53,914 --> 00:18:55,744
The owner of the building is on vacation.

299
00:18:55,745 --> 00:18:57,785
It'll be hard to contact the owner.

300
00:19:00,384 --> 00:19:01,414
What?

301
00:19:02,485 --> 00:19:03,654
Gosh.

302
00:19:09,624 --> 00:19:10,864
Emergency!

303
00:19:11,265 --> 00:19:13,435
Big emergency in the office!

304
00:19:15,305 --> 00:19:16,603
Hurry up.

305
00:19:16,604 --> 00:19:18,505
We might be able to save it.

306
00:19:19,535 --> 00:19:21,735
It won't work.

307
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:25,614
Why are you two crying?

308
00:19:25,975 --> 00:19:27,015
I don't know.

309
00:19:28,174 --> 00:19:31,383
We worked so hard on this.

310
00:19:31,384 --> 00:19:33,083
Team One's Mr. Noh...

311
00:19:33,084 --> 00:19:37,025
came over and...

312
00:19:40,624 --> 00:19:42,265
Pink is too obvious.

313
00:19:42,394 --> 00:19:44,694
It should look fun. Get rid of the pink.

314
00:19:44,695 --> 00:19:46,164
What do you know?

315
00:19:46,965 --> 00:19:48,334
Just kidding!

316
00:19:48,435 --> 00:19:49,805
I guess...

317
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:54,903
I think changing the font would make it look classy.

318
00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:57,103
What a joke. Oh, I'm sorry.

319
00:19:57,104 --> 00:20:00,343
Just change it.

320
00:20:00,344 --> 00:20:02,684
- Just change it. - Hold on.

321
00:20:02,685 --> 00:20:04,184
This looks better.

322
00:20:04,185 --> 00:20:06,984
- Everyone, stop. - Stop.

323
00:20:06,985 --> 00:20:08,184
What's this about?

324
00:20:08,185 --> 00:20:11,154
We were told that tasks should not be distributed between teams...

325
00:20:11,354 --> 00:20:12,624
without the official approval.

326
00:20:13,455 --> 00:20:15,295
Since when was that a thing?

327
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:17,725
- Ms. Seo Ul Soop. - Yes?

328
00:20:17,894 --> 00:20:20,834
- May I see your computer? - No.

329
00:20:20,995 --> 00:20:22,504
Get rid of everything you've worked on.

330
00:20:22,505 --> 00:20:23,534
No!

331
00:20:23,535 --> 00:20:24,633
What are you talking about?

332
00:20:24,634 --> 00:20:26,774
- No! - Why should we do that?

333
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:28,744
- No! - Get rid of it!

334
00:20:28,745 --> 00:20:32,344
That's how we lost all of our work.

335
00:20:34,215 --> 00:20:36,015
I'm so sorry.

336
00:20:36,245 --> 00:20:37,245
I'm sorry.

337
00:20:37,715 --> 00:20:40,454
You should've stopped them!

338
00:20:40,455 --> 00:20:42,353
It was your fault!

339
00:20:42,354 --> 00:20:45,254
- It was your fault. - It was your fault.

340
00:20:45,255 --> 00:20:46,255
Stop!

341
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:53,134
Can they be doing that to us?

342
00:20:53,535 --> 00:20:54,535
What's wrong?

343
00:20:55,364 --> 00:20:57,005
Is that not possible?

344
00:20:59,935 --> 00:21:01,574
I took your advice.

345
00:21:01,775 --> 00:21:03,174
What, Ms. Do?

346
00:21:03,404 --> 00:21:04,445
"Ms. Do?"

347
00:21:04,775 --> 00:21:06,074
Why are you sounding so formal?

348
00:21:07,614 --> 00:21:08,614
What?

349
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:12,055
What did I say to you?

350
00:21:12,785 --> 00:21:15,285
You said you need to have what's most important...

351
00:21:15,584 --> 00:21:17,154
to start a deal.

352
00:21:19,094 --> 00:21:21,093
You need a place for a pop-up store.

353
00:21:21,094 --> 00:21:22,725
But it's in my hands.

354
00:21:25,164 --> 00:21:27,393
You need the art for the pop-up store.

355
00:21:27,394 --> 00:21:29,265
But I have the power to get rid of it.

356
00:21:32,005 --> 00:21:34,275
I have everything you need.

357
00:21:35,344 --> 00:21:36,475
So let's make a deal.

358
00:21:41,614 --> 00:21:44,344
What is it that you want?

359
00:21:45,245 --> 00:21:46,614
Your pride.

360
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:52,725
Beg me for help.

361
00:21:56,965 --> 00:21:58,465
Then I'll give it some thought.

362
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:02,765
The same goes for you, Eun Ho.

363
00:22:05,035 --> 00:22:06,174
Beg with her.

364
00:22:09,775 --> 00:22:11,745
Only then, I won't get in your way.

365
00:22:12,475 --> 00:22:14,275
Are you serious?

366
00:22:19,985 --> 00:22:20,985
Is that a no?

367
00:22:26,295 --> 00:22:28,055
- I'm sorry. - What?

368
00:22:30,164 --> 00:22:31,265
I'm very sorry.

369
00:22:32,765 --> 00:22:34,894
I really don't know what I should be sorry about.

370
00:22:36,435 --> 00:22:37,535
I apologize for not knowing that.

371
00:22:38,064 --> 00:22:40,534
How dare you speak like that to me?

372
00:22:40,535 --> 00:22:41,535
One more thing.

373
00:22:43,844 --> 00:22:45,344
You're not getting in my way at all.

374
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,245
