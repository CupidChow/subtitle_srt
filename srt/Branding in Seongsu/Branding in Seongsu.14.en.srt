5
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:09,119
Hello. This is Actor Nam Yoon Hyuk.

6
00:00:10,018 --> 00:00:11,219
With my name up front,

7
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:13,458
it's an honor to be able to be a part of...

8
00:00:13,459 --> 00:00:14,989
Segye Group's Wrisky launch.

9
00:00:19,299 --> 00:00:20,759
We're done for.

10
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:24,128
No, Jenny. We can do this.

11
00:00:26,139 --> 00:00:27,498
We won't say too much.

12
00:00:28,308 --> 00:00:29,338
Team One...

13
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:32,209
will completely change Segye Soju...

14
00:00:32,709 --> 00:00:36,409
with Actor Nam Yoon Hyuk up front.

15
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:39,547
While keeping Segye Soju's high alcohol degree and scent...

16
00:00:39,548 --> 00:00:41,148
compared to other brands,

17
00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:43,449
we will target the high alcohol degree market...

18
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:45,319
(High alcohol degree, premium soju)

19
00:00:46,258 --> 00:00:47,519
of 23 degrees.

20
00:00:49,228 --> 00:00:51,997
Everything is ready for the change of package design.

21
00:00:51,998 --> 00:00:54,328
Production and promotion companies have been secured.

22
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:56,129
This isn't fair.

23
00:00:56,868 --> 00:00:59,839
Giving Ms. Kang a benefit now seems meaningless.

24
00:01:01,038 --> 00:01:03,209
You're too strong for a newbie, Cho Won Koo.

25
00:01:03,709 --> 00:01:05,709
- Cho Won Koo? - Who's that?

26
00:01:05,838 --> 00:01:07,137
- Cho Won Koo? - It's not Cho Won Koo.

27
00:01:07,138 --> 00:01:08,209
It's So Eun Ho.

28
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:09,549
It's So Eun Ho?

29
00:01:14,579 --> 00:01:15,648
Anyway...

30
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,219
Ms. Do.

31
00:01:19,088 --> 00:01:20,189
It's your first time scoring.

32
00:01:20,819 --> 00:01:21,829
Right.

33
00:01:23,528 --> 00:01:24,999
Let's just proceed with this.

34
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:27,828
Thank you, Director Hwang.

35
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:29,367
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

36
00:01:29,368 --> 00:01:31,069
Wait. Director Hwang.

37
00:01:32,099 --> 00:01:34,068
Aren't you going to check our presentation?

38
00:01:34,069 --> 00:01:35,109
Do you have something?

39
00:01:35,838 --> 00:01:39,308
Something like that with an exclusive brand identity?

40
00:01:43,678 --> 00:01:44,678
Yes.

41
00:01:45,918 --> 00:01:46,978
Well,

42
00:01:48,448 --> 00:01:50,888
we cannot afford star marketing.

43
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:53,587
However, through Jenny...

44
00:01:53,588 --> 00:01:54,859
Segye Soju...

45
00:01:55,528 --> 00:01:57,228
needs a star.

46
00:01:59,499 --> 00:02:00,528
Not a high school grad like her.

47
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,629
- Did he just call me that again? - No.

48
00:02:04,898 --> 00:02:05,969
Let's go.

49
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:11,778
- There he is! - There!

50
00:02:11,779 --> 00:02:13,809
- Nam Yoon Hyuk! - Nam Yoon Hyuk!

51
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,477
- Nam Yoon Hyuk! - Nam Yoon Hyuk!

52
00:02:15,478 --> 00:02:16,708
- Nam Yoon Hyuk! - Nam Yoon Hyuk!

53
00:02:17,249 --> 00:02:19,818
- Nam Yoon Hyuk! - Something must be up.

54
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:21,378
Is the recent article on the use of drugs true?

55
00:02:21,379 --> 00:02:23,447
Including the use of marijuana, there are claims that...

56
00:02:23,448 --> 00:02:24,788
you have been spotted dealing with them.

57
00:02:24,988 --> 00:02:27,119
I do not know what you're talking about.

58
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,788
What is all this about?

59
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:35,328
There are photos of you online. Are you sure you don't know?

60
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:37,098
"The police have been reported about the use of drugs."

61
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:39,238
"They rushed into Nam Yoon Hyuk's house."

62
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:42,538
"Spotted dealing with marijuana enough for 300 people."

63
00:02:42,608 --> 00:02:44,737
- Nam Yoon Hyuk! - Nam Yoon Hyuk!

64
00:02:44,738 --> 00:02:45,839
Please tell us.

65
00:02:45,978 --> 00:02:47,208
Was this you?

66
00:02:47,839 --> 00:02:48,909
I told you.

67
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:51,379
I won't be losing.

68
00:02:51,918 --> 00:02:53,719
This little punk...

69
00:02:57,649 --> 00:02:59,957
- Hey. - I'm really going to do it.

70
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:01,417
- Go for it. - Let's go for it.

71
00:03:01,418 --> 00:03:02,629
- Go for it. - Go.

72
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:10,029
You should know when to stop.

73
00:03:11,569 --> 00:03:12,638
A step further...

74
00:03:13,999 --> 00:03:16,107
and even the mighty Kang Na Eon won't be able to help you.

75
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:17,809
Darn it!

76
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:21,107
Nam Yoon Hyuk! Have you just signed a commercial contract?

77
00:03:21,108 --> 00:03:23,947
What will you do with the projects and commercials you are in?

78
00:03:23,948 --> 00:03:25,918
All right.

79
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:28,218
Everybody needs to relax.

80
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:29,618
It's Hwang Je Ha!

81
00:03:29,619 --> 00:03:31,047
It's Segye Group's Director Hwang Je Ha.

82
00:03:31,048 --> 00:03:32,288
- Hwang Je Ha! - Hwang Je Ha!

83
00:03:32,388 --> 00:03:35,088
Was there an agreement with Nam Yoon Hyuk?

84
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,727
What are your plans for the current contract?

85
00:03:37,728 --> 00:03:39,258
- Please tell us! - Gosh!

86
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:44,197
Call the police!

87
00:03:44,198 --> 00:03:47,098
Gosh, why is he always wearing flip-flops?

88
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,668
They really know how to get someone.

89
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:01,418
What?

90
00:04:10,529 --> 00:04:11,998
(Kim Ji Eun, Lomon)

91
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:13,159
(Yang Hye Ji, Kim Ho Young)

92
00:04:28,609 --> 00:04:31,447
(Branding in Seongsu)

93
00:04:31,448 --> 00:04:33,278
(Segye Group)

94
00:04:49,828 --> 00:04:51,799
Director Hwang Je Ha has arrived.

95
00:05:03,609 --> 00:05:06,648
Gosh, I'm feeling awful today.

96
00:05:07,018 --> 00:05:08,218
Do as you wish.

97
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:14,588
Seongsu Agency and Segye Group...

98
00:05:14,989 --> 00:05:17,328
is in the headlines of a scandalous situation.

99
00:05:17,929 --> 00:05:19,828
It will be solved very soon.

100
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:25,337
As Employee So Eun Ho was in charge of the project,

101
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:27,168
we've got into some trouble.

102
00:05:27,169 --> 00:05:29,507
Are you passing all of the responsibility...

103
00:05:29,508 --> 00:05:31,337
to a newcomer who has just come?

104
00:05:31,338 --> 00:05:33,907
I wasn't passing the responsibility. I was just trusting him.

105
00:05:33,908 --> 00:05:35,979
That's how you worked with Na Eon.

106
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:39,049
And it wasn't me.

107
00:05:39,218 --> 00:05:41,147
So Eun Ho was the one...

108
00:05:41,148 --> 00:05:43,419
to proceed with the contract for Nam Yoon Hyuk.

109
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:44,518
My goodness.

110
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:47,289
- That guy deserves an award. - Sorry?

111
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:49,729
The contract was very detailed.

112
00:05:50,528 --> 00:05:52,229
Thanks to him,

113
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:54,559
we earned some money through compensation.

114
00:05:55,369 --> 00:05:56,999
But thanks to you,

115
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:02,468
I was stacked with hospital bills.

116
00:06:07,278 --> 00:06:08,278
What is this?

117
00:06:09,749 --> 00:06:12,379
It's like you haven't even checked the contract before approving it.

118
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:15,749
No. That's not it.

119
00:06:16,888 --> 00:06:18,189
It seems like being the team manager...

120
00:06:19,518 --> 00:06:21,458
isn't the right place for you, Yoo Mi.

121
00:06:24,729 --> 00:06:27,897
All right. Let's close things up with Ms. Do's disciplinary action.

122
00:06:27,898 --> 00:06:29,168
No, Director Hwang!

123
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:30,898
Shut that mouth.

124
00:06:37,739 --> 00:06:41,208
But what do we do with Segye Soju now?

125
00:06:44,008 --> 00:06:46,248
I heard there was a team you prepared...

126
00:06:46,249 --> 00:06:48,619
in case something like this happened.

127
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,489
I said that.

128
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:54,458
I'm so proud of myself.

129
00:06:55,989 --> 00:06:56,989
Kang Na Eon?

130
00:07:15,908 --> 00:07:18,078
Why do you keep following me, Mr. So Eun Ho?

131
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:20,218
We're not even in the same team.

132
00:07:22,948 --> 00:07:24,049
So you don't feel nervous.

133
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:25,859
To support you.

134
00:07:26,289 --> 00:07:27,989
Well, it's not working at all.

135
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:29,958
Then...

136
00:07:31,689 --> 00:07:33,799
why don't you show a real sign of support?

137
00:07:40,838 --> 00:07:42,039
Show them what you've got.

138
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:46,008
I quite like...

139
00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:47,879
the branding you came up with.

140
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:55,448
Even still,

141
00:07:56,718 --> 00:07:58,419
I will be mad at you for ten days.

142
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:00,518
Boo!

143
00:08:17,169 --> 00:08:18,309
Goodbye.

144
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:28,789
It was all you, wasn't it?

145
00:08:29,518 --> 00:08:32,059
- Is this why you came to me... - I told you.

146
00:08:32,259 --> 00:08:34,759
You have to have what the opponent really wants...

147
00:08:35,118 --> 00:08:36,689
to win a fight.

148
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:38,488
Who do you think you are?

149
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,358
What do you have?

150
00:08:43,998 --> 00:08:46,198
Something that you were dying to have.

151
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:54,078
Kang Na Eon's everything.

152
00:08:56,948 --> 00:08:59,118
Good luck, Do Yoo Mi.

153
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:24,238
I will begin...

154
00:09:24,838 --> 00:09:27,909
the presentation for Segye Soju's rebranding concept.

155
00:09:33,248 --> 00:09:36,419
How much do you all drink?

156
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:47,759
A glass or two of whisky?

157
00:09:49,769 --> 00:09:50,968
What about you, Director Hwang?

158
00:09:52,039 --> 00:09:54,967
Well, if you want to flirt with girls,

159
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:56,838
you need to know how to drink.

160
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,338
Right.

161
00:09:59,108 --> 00:10:02,478
That is why many people said this.

162
00:10:02,909 --> 00:10:04,178
(You need to know how to drink.)

163
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:06,378
"You need to know how to drink."

164
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:07,478
Yes.

165
00:10:07,649 --> 00:10:09,288
If you are to get close with someone,

166
00:10:09,289 --> 00:10:11,189
you need to know how to drink.

167
00:10:11,618 --> 00:10:12,689
That's right.

168
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,627
However, according to recent studies,

169
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:19,058
a total of 66 percent of Gen Zers...

170
00:10:19,059 --> 00:10:22,197
have wanted to reduce the consumption of alcohol.

171
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:25,068
Additionally, it is a global trend for the decline...

172
00:10:25,069 --> 00:10:26,837
of alcohol consumption.

173
00:10:26,838 --> 00:10:27,838
Hold it right there.

174
00:10:28,738 --> 00:10:31,868
Wasn't this what So Eun Ho did?

175
00:10:32,009 --> 00:10:33,108
He wanted to stop selling alcohol.

176
00:10:33,338 --> 00:10:36,608
Oh, it's different. We will be selling alcohol.

177
00:10:38,978 --> 00:10:40,019
But...

178
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:43,948
it will be for those who can't drink well.

179
00:10:45,488 --> 00:10:46,559
Those who can't drink?

180
00:10:52,929 --> 00:10:54,798
Many people say they get drunk in the atmosphere.

181
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,898
(Atmosphere)

182
00:10:56,899 --> 00:11:00,338
The cool atmosphere with a cold beer after work.

183
00:11:01,539 --> 00:11:04,538
The joyful atmosphere that comes from the people...

184
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:05,679
you love being with.

185
00:11:06,838 --> 00:11:08,808
The sentimental atmosphere of that night...

186
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,878
that comes from the whispers of love with your lover.

187
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,518
The atmosphere of that first night...

188
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,019
everyone must have experienced.

189
00:11:25,858 --> 00:11:26,929
Hold on.

190
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:28,529
Aren't they in school uniforms?

191
00:11:29,498 --> 00:11:31,868
Going emotional is fine, but that is too much.

192
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:34,439
It's okay.

193
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:36,809
Segye Group...

194
00:11:37,338 --> 00:11:40,408
will be selling the safest drink in the world.

195
00:11:40,409 --> 00:11:41,439
Safest drink?

196
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:46,649
With family members, friends and lovers.

197
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:51,948
Men and women of all age groups can enjoy this drink.

198
00:11:52,389 --> 00:11:56,159
I introduce Segye Soju's non-alcoholic drink, Mood.

199
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:01,929
(Mood, the atmosphere of that day)

200
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:10,838
Non-alcoholic?

201
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:15,378
The non-alcoholic drink market,

202
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:18,878
even in the midst of the decline of alcohol consumption,

203
00:12:19,149 --> 00:12:23,588
is showing a large growth starting with 14 billion dollars.

204
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:27,018
Currently, the strategy is to target the niche market.

205
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:30,289
But by witnessing the decline of alcohol consumption in Korea,

206
00:12:30,628 --> 00:12:31,789
in the next five years,

207
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:34,858
alcohol consumption will no longer be in the majority.

208
00:12:35,358 --> 00:12:38,467
Thus, the niche market we will be targeting...

209
00:12:38,468 --> 00:12:41,439
will become the main market in the future.

210
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:44,169
I believe it's a winnable fight.

211
00:12:47,578 --> 00:12:49,509
I wouldn't say this anywhere else.

212
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,018
I was just bluffing in front of girls.

213
00:12:56,019 --> 00:12:58,488
I can't really drink too. I'm an AB.

214
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:03,458
AB?

215
00:13:03,559 --> 00:13:05,259
It's AT for Alcohol Trash.

216
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,529
It's Alcohol Trash? It's not, "Alcohol is bitter?"

217
00:13:09,728 --> 00:13:10,799
Anyway...

218
00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:23,149
It sounds interesting. Proceed with this idea.

219
00:13:27,978 --> 00:13:30,217
Right. Thank you.

220
00:13:30,218 --> 00:13:31,218
By the way,

221
00:13:31,219 --> 00:13:33,189
how are you going to promote it?

222
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:35,419
Do not worry about that.

223
00:13:36,189 --> 00:13:39,159
We have a very special influencer.

224
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:52,408
Get your IDs ready nice and quick.

225
00:13:52,409 --> 00:13:53,409
Really?

226
00:13:53,410 --> 00:13:54,639
Show me your wrist.

227
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:57,808
- Right here. - This is so lovely. Goodness.

228
00:13:57,809 --> 00:13:58,877
Welcome.

229
00:13:58,878 --> 00:14:01,318
Let's see your IDs.

230
00:14:01,319 --> 00:14:03,718
Gosh. You're such a baby.

231
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,689
Enjoy your time. Let everyone know about it.

232
00:14:07,319 --> 00:14:08,888
Take a lot of photos.

233
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,788
It's party time!

234
00:14:10,789 --> 00:14:14,029
All right. Come this way.

235
00:14:14,128 --> 00:14:15,429
Okay.

236
00:14:16,598 --> 00:14:18,597
Follow us.

237
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:19,798
Be careful.

238
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:21,299
Come this way.

239
00:14:22,338 --> 00:14:24,408
I'm loving the atmosphere here.

240
00:14:24,409 --> 00:14:25,877
This way.

241
00:14:25,878 --> 00:14:27,679
- This way. - Okay?

242
00:14:27,708 --> 00:14:29,748
We've got to go. All right.

243
00:14:34,718 --> 00:14:36,848
What was that about?

244
00:14:36,948 --> 00:14:37,988
But...

245
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:41,458
Jung Woo.

246
00:14:43,189 --> 00:14:44,228
Cha Jung Woo.

247
00:14:45,659 --> 00:14:46,997
Are you okay, Na Eon?

248
00:14:46,998 --> 00:14:48,929
Gosh. Of course, I am.

249
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:53,799
Actually, no.

250
00:14:54,669 --> 00:14:55,809
You're talking about the peach allergy, right?

251
00:14:56,669 --> 00:14:59,179
Hey! You could've told me about it.

252
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:01,207
I was scratching myself to death.

253
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,878
I'm sorry. I was trying to tell you, but...

254
00:15:06,649 --> 00:15:08,178
You're always so serious.

255
00:15:08,179 --> 00:15:09,189
I'm sorry about that too.

256
00:15:12,218 --> 00:15:13,389
Jung Woo.

257
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,458
Who makes an apology like that?

258
00:15:16,858 --> 00:15:19,628
Man up and be direct. "Sorry!"

259
00:15:33,909 --> 00:15:35,208
Man up...

260
00:15:36,509 --> 00:15:37,809
and be direct?

261
00:15:40,748 --> 00:15:43,649
Gosh, Mr. Cha!

262
00:15:45,289 --> 00:15:48,988
You really know how to kill the mood.

263
00:15:49,019 --> 00:15:51,227
Newbie? Escort him inside.

264
00:15:51,228 --> 00:15:52,928
I'm fine. You can go in first.

265
00:15:52,929 --> 00:15:53,958
Why don't we...

266
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:57,327
- go in together? - But I...

267
00:15:57,328 --> 00:15:58,698
Let's go!

268
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:00,639
Let's go!

269
00:16:01,569 --> 00:16:03,138

270
00:16:03,139 --> 00:16:04,338
Let's have some.

271
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:06,539
Let's get drunk in the Mood!

272
00:16:18,718 --> 00:16:20,759
Hey, you have to join the fun.

273

Not them, Young Ae.

274
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,607
Hey, don't be like that!

275
00:16:38,608 --> 00:16:41,308
Everybody together. Mood! Don't you get it?

276
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:45,107
Mood! Move!

277
00:16:45,108 --> 00:16:46,178
Gosh.

278
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:47,548
- Come this way. - We're fine.

279
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,549
Oh, come on.

280
00:16:49,618 --> 00:16:50,919
Hurry!

281
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:54,288
Move!

282
00:16:54,289 --> 00:16:58,389
- Dance! - Dance!

283
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,438
Let's go!

284
00:17:16,348 --> 00:17:17,377
Go!

285
00:17:17,378 --> 00:17:18,948
Show us!

286
00:17:18,949 --> 00:17:20,648
- Show us! - Show us!

287
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:25,749
Show us!

288
00:17:30,358 --> 00:17:31,687

293

The party...

294
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:45,438
starts now!

295
00:18:01,658 --> 00:18:02,888
I must upload this.

297
00:18:07,328 --> 00:18:09,499
It's okay if you can't drink.

299
00:18:12,699 --> 00:18:14,569
Big success!

300

Hey!

302
00:19:18,828 --> 00:19:19,868
Up for a drink?

303
00:19:21,898 --> 00:19:22,938
Come on.

That was actual soju.

308

I was giving you space to enjoy your win.

312
00:20:07,049 --> 00:20:08,078
It's your first time...

313
00:20:08,648 --> 00:20:11,388
getting in a competition and winning the project.

314
00:20:11,688 --> 00:20:13,019
Yes!

315
00:20:17,029 --> 00:20:18,128
But...

316
00:20:18,459 --> 00:20:20,529
why didn't you tell me your plan this time?

317
00:20:21,959 --> 00:20:23,769
Did you think I would do well on my own?

318
00:20:25,168 --> 00:20:27,098
I thought you would do well...

319
00:20:27,438 --> 00:20:28,938
to let the whole world know about it.

320
00:20:31,638 --> 00:20:33,608
I'll get madder at you after ten days.

Gosh. I like drinking on my own.

325
00:20:53,358 --> 00:20:56,368
I must bother you even more from now on.

Even after we get our bodies back,

327
00:21:00,269 --> 00:21:02,239

You can...

329
00:21:06,408 --> 00:21:09,608
drink with this handsome face.

330
00:21:23,888 --> 00:21:24,989
We never stop!

331
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,529
We never stop drinking!

It's not Yoo Mi. Don't worry.

341
00:22:16,108 --> 00:22:17,249
I feel worried.

342
00:22:18,148 --> 00:22:19,479
It feels like something worse.

00:22:22,019 --> 00:22:23,749

They'll know it was me...

350
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:00,989
behind the Nam Yoon Hyuk incident.

351
00:23:02,219 --> 00:23:05,289
Is that person calling you?

352
00:23:06,628 --> 00:23:07,628
Probably.

Calling me even after knowing everything...

355
00:23:14,168 --> 00:23:15,338
means they really want...

356
00:23:16,209 --> 00:23:17,338
So Eun Ho.

357
00:23:18,009 --> 00:23:19,438

What's wrong with you? You're sounding weird.

364

I heard there was still a bit of alcohol in non-alcoholic drinks.

365
00:23:49,868 --> 00:23:52,039
I guess that's why I'm a little drunk.
