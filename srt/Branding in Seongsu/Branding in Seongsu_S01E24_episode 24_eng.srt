1
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:07,340
   

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,680
 Segye Group marketing department's new executive director, 

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:13,080
Ms. Min Hee Jeong's inauguration ceremony will start now.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,940
     

5
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:24,270
I want to thank everyone who took the time to come here today.

6
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:30,800
I'm Min Hee Jeong, and I'll serve as the executive director of Segye Group.

7
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:39,830


8
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,540
♫  Walk steadily just like as Rocky  ♫

9
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:53,320
It's great to be back in a place where it feels like my hometown.

10
00:00:53,320 --> 00:01:04,430
I promise I'll devote the rest of my life to Segye Group and...

11
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,640
I'd like to revive Segye Group's glo—

12
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,170
glorious days...

13
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,200
Looks like you're pretty flustered.

14
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,740
You must've worked a long time to prepare the speech, yet you're stuttering so much.

15
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:23,390
How dare you come here!

16
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:26,550
♫  I'm breaking rocks  ♫

17
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,760
   

18
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,590
   

19
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,330
   

20
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,860
   

21
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,100
   

22
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,340
   

23
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,040
    

24
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,830
Team Leader, you should leave first.

25
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,300
We'll take care of the rest here.

26
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,280
Hey! Die!

27
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,860
Die! Die!

28
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:22,570
You'd better let go!

29
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:34,510
Let's stop this, Yu Mi.

30
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:44,980
I apologize.

31
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,930
To be honest,

32
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,650
there was something I wanted to achieve.

33
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,220
And since I've only been focusing on that thing,

34
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,660
I didn't care for the people around me.

35
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,700
- We... 
 - No.

36
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,100
It's my fault.

37
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:20,120
It's my fault, Na Eon.

38
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,660
I knew I was doing the wrong thing for a while,

39
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:28,110
but I wasn't sure how to fix it.

40
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:31,160
I'm so sorry.

41
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,510
I really don't know what I'm supposed to do.

42
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,000
 Ta-da. 

43
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,180
Because I like you so much,

44
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,500
I guess that's why I came to hate you so much.

45
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:13,980
You couldn't even handle all this. You dummy.

46
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,570
Wait here for a moment.

47
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,380
Sorry, I took so long.

48
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,170
It's okay.

49
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,250
Go die!

50
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,610
- I need a hand over here. 
 - Okay.

51
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,830
Untie this.

52
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:35,130
By the way, how did you guys know we were here?

53
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,430
 Why don't you do your duty as a senior? 

54
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,160
 W-Why would I do that? 

55
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,950
 I know you teamed up with Yu Mi and stole the High Jet presentation. 

56
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,570
 How can I help you, Hoobaenim? 

57
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,580
Sunbae...

58
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:15,120
Here. Good thing we prepared an extra one.

59
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,160
But do you think this recording will be enough?

60
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,970
It won't be perfect, but it will be a critical blow.

61
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:27,530
How dare you come here!

62
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:29,320
Exactly.

63
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,420
Do you think...

64
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:38,590
you have the right to be up here?

65
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,930
Let me ask you, Director.

66
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,790
Do you really still think creating a bigger scandal

67
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:57,080
is the way to cover up this scandal, just like you did five years ago?

68
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,030
Well...

69
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:01,800
Why are you asking me that?

70
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,780
I don't understand.

71
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,460
It might get covered up for now.

72
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:14,020
But this won't resolve the public's misperception of you.

73
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,610
For example,

74
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,970
they think you're a privileged drug addict, a third-generation heir who fixes everything with money.

75
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:26,370
It turns out he has 10 illegitimate children in Europe alone  and so on.

76
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:30,160
Team Leader Kang, what are you trying to say?

77
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,540
What if I give you a chance to...

78
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,390
prove the rumors wrong and start a new life?

79
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:47,350
Wouldn't that give me enough reason to be up here?

80
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,090
   

81
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,990
   

82
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:57,670
Do you think branding is only for corporations?

83
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,940
   

84
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,740
   

85
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:07,370
Seongsu Agency's rebranding project, Localizing Project,

86
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:13,280
 will discover food, products, culture, and hidden stories 

87
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:17,730
 that failed to garner attention in Seongsu. 

88
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:24,250
Segye Group will oversee investment, distribution, and promotion for small businesses.

89
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:29,340
And Seongsu Agency's mascot will be...

90
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,980
the kind and friendly local residence,

91
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,000
Mr. Hwang Jae Ha.

92
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:45,970
A mischievous third-generation heir with a friendly image. What do you think?

93
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,890
Very nice. I absolutely love it.

94
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:57,190
What are you rambling on about now?

95
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,200
Kang Na Eon is a criminal.

96
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,110
Call the police immediately—

97
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,760
 Eliminate him. 

98
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:09,610
 So Eun Ho has been tangled up with me so long for no reason. 

99
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:12,480
 You planned what happened five years ago and 

100
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:16,830
 XU Beauty's pop-up incident to destroy Kang Na Eon? 

101
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,230
That's right.

102
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:22,940
She became way too arrogant, forgetting that I had practically raised her.

103
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:25,510
 I struggled so much because of that. 

104
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:29,650
 I fabricated Director Hwang's drug scandal and had to cover it up. 

105
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,690
 Bandi Candle had to suffer for no reason. 

106
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:40,080
 But Kang Na Eon has been acting too unruly and cheeky for the past five years. 

107
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,590
T-This was fabricated.

108
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,780
This is defamation!

109
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:49,220
 Kang Na Eon should have just died at the XU Beauty pop-up. 

110
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:52,360
 She created all this mess by coming back to life. 

111
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,580
 I also had to come up with the illegitimate child scandal. 

112
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,880
What the f***?

113
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,470
Is this for real? Seriously?

114
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,700
Well...

115
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,750
What a mess.

116
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:13,070
Director! Director, hold on.

117
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:15,200
Director, you're mistaken.

118
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,960
Director!

119
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,870
I was so nervous. Seriously.

120
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,950
Director, it's a misunderstanding!

121
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,470
Director! It's easy to fabricate an audio file.

122
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:28,350
Please, Director. Please listen to me, Director.

123
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:30,870
Mistaken? About what?

124
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,290
- It was all fabricated. 
 - Fabricated?

125
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,260
Director, please listen to me!

126
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:36,040
What is there to listen to?

127
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,900
It was all fabricated!

128
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,890
It wasn't fabricated.

129
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,770
I pushed Team Leader Kang at the XU Beauty pop-up

130
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,600
and I did that

131
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,490
because Director Min Hee Jeong told me to.

132
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:57,230
I'll diligently assist with the investigation

133
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,950
and pay for the crime I committed.

134
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:10,480
Kang Na Eon, you!

135
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:18,390
Kang Na Eon, how could you do this to me...

136
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,210
Why?

137
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,980
I'm just paying you back for what you did to me.

138
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,680
It's all over now.

139
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,430
So now go and pay for your crimes.

140
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,450
Pay for my crimes because it's over?

141
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,570
Who says that will happen?

142
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:44,580
The investigation will reveal the truth.

143
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,520
Let me tell you this one thing in advance.

144
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,740
Your girlfriend...

145
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,220
I killed her...

146
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:58,680
because of you.

147
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,980
Remember that for the rest of your life.

148
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,980
You better stop now.

149
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,880
You should remember this, too.

150
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,610
It's all your fault.

151
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:22,780
Don't listen to her, So Eun Ho.

152
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,570
So Eun Ho.

153
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,940
I can't believe you confessed to the crime.

154
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,960
Thanks for making it easy.

155
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,360
I'm nothing like you.

156
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,320
What a total mess.

157
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:38,870
Ms. Min Hee Jeong, you're under arrest for aiding and abetting a murder.

158
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:40,530
Arrest her.

159
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,520
Let go. Let go of me!

160
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,790
Let go! I told you to let go!

161
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:48,870
I think you should also come with us, Mr. Cha.

162
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,490
Yes, Sir.

163
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,180
Let's go.

164
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,320
You did a good job holding back.

165
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:50,470
   

166
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,180
I knew it was strange.

167
00:13:53,180 --> 00:14:01,110
It was suspicious when Ms. Min came up with a solution as soon as the scandal broke.

168
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:02,680
I mean it.

169
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,030
Anyway.

170
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,660
Team Leader Kang's local project. I love it so much.

171
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:14,740
Be kind. Be friendly. That's hip these days.

172
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,270
Anyway,

173
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:20,770
I want you to start working on this project next week.

174
00:14:20,770 --> 00:14:23,080
Under Seongsu Agency.

175
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,350
I don't think I'll be able to work for a while.

176
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,520
Director Min did stir things up a bit.

177
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:30,620
My image isn't so great right now.

178
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:34,310
I think I might taint the image of the project.

179
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:39,560
A scandal needs to be covered up with a bigger one.

180
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:50,420
   

181
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:55,100
- What are you doing? 
 - Hold on.

182
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,050
Be careful. Be careful.

183
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,880
- What is it? 
 - Wait.

184
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,190
One, two, three!

185
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:03,460
 Ta-da! 

186
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,940
We're throwing you a party!

187
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:12,210
Congratulations, President Kang.

188
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,140
 

189
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,630
"Kang Na Eon, CEO." 
    

190
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,230
Wow, unbelievable.

191
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:21,250
Kang Na Eon killed it.

192
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:26,430
What? Where are you going?

193
00:15:26,430 --> 00:15:28,070
My office.

194
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:30,920
We got rid of your office.

195
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,980
- What? 
 - Haven't you heard of open management?

196
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,120
It's trendy for the CEO to work with the employees these days.

197
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,480
But wouldn't you feel more comfortable being separated from me?

198
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:47,300
 Not at all! 

199
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:49,760
Wow, this will make the news.

200
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:53,540
The youngest CEO in marketing and her open management style.

201
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,410
I'll post it on Instagram.

202
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,040
Let's take a group photo!

203
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,120
Come here.

204
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,380
Team Leader Nam, you should leave.

205
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,230
I'm leaving, okay?

206
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,240
Okay.

207
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,280
One, two, three!

208
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:20,950
Congratulations.

209
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,810
Thank you.

210
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:41,130
Which one should I post? This or this?

211
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,680
How are you feeling?

212
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,840
It's a great opportunity.

213
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,710
- I don't like this one. 
 - I agree.

214
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,970
Things ended the way they should have.

215
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:52,120
Should I post this one?

216
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,810
This one? This one?

217
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,440
- Let me try it. 
 - Should we cut the cake?

218
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,720
- Wow! 
 - Let's, let's!

219
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,880
Let's cut the cake.

220
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:11,950
Is it because of what Min Hee Jeong said?

221
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,320
Yes.

222
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,930
Well...

223
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:30,470
since you mentioned it...

224
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:43,070
I think I'll need some time off.

225
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:53,600
I don't want to become someone like Min Hee Jeong,

226
00:18:55,530 --> 00:18:58,440
but whenever I think of what she said,

227
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:03,160
I keep turning into someone else.

228
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,730
Eun Ho...

229
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,830
I...

230
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:35,430
I'll be back soon.

231
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,820
♫  Can you see it from afar?  ♫

232
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:53,200
♫  It belongs to you and I  ♫

233
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,410
♫  The star we created together  ♫

234
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:01,820
♫  It will always be there  ♫

235
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:05,710
♫  Lift up your head when you're tired  ♫

236
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,520
♫  This is love itself  ♫

237
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:18,380
♫  It's what I've been keeping in my heart for a long time  ♫

238
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:22,830
♫  You might get lost sometimes  ♫

239
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:27,850
♫  You might have no one else to blame sometimes  ♫

240
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:35,820
♫  But try to remember this moment right here  ♫

241
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,180
♫  On a day full of sunshine  ♫

242
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:45,210
♫  Amidst everyone's laughter  ♫

243
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:50,720
♫  Even when I feel lonely, I'll continue...  ♫

244
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:12,470
♫  And shine here  ♫

245
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,790
   

246
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,990
   

247
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:28,670
   

248
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:31,390
This is the lobby.

249
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:34,740
Our office has an open floor plan with two stories.

250
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:39,860
And to enter the building, you need to wear the staff ID like this.

251
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,090
Gosh, daebak.

252
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,720
It's so cool, Sunbaenim.

253
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,790
Should we go to the art office now?

254
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,850
- Yes. 
 - Yes.

255
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:51,200
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

256
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,400
Hello, Team Leader.

257
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:58,130
Wow, look how excited they are. They're so freaking cute.

258
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:01,350
Are there any handsome ones this time?

259
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,260
There aren't.

260
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,330
Eun Ho's looks were sensational.

261
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:12,930
Gosh, it was so revolutionary.

262
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,500
I miss Eun Ho Honey.

263
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,130
He was so bold.

264
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,470
By the way, has Team Leader Kang... no, no...

265
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:21,520
I mean, President Kang eaten?

266
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:25,150
She went to a meeting with Team Leader Yu Mi.

267
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,240
 Gosh, I'm sorry. 

268
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:40,530
 I meant to tell you the meeting got rescheduled. I forgot. 

269
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:43,150
Geez, Team Leader Nam. Son of a bitch.

270
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:46,190
He's still sabotaging us after joining a competitor?

271
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,710
I'm sorry, Na Eon.

272
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:55,570
I should've checked the meeting time more carefully.

273
00:22:55,570 --> 00:22:57,430
Yu Mi.

274
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,090
Yes?

275
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:02,560
You didn't do anything wrong.

276
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,820
- Sir. 
 - Yes?

277
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,760
Please drop us off at the light ahead.

278
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,230
Okay.

279
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,880
Let's walk a bit. The weather's nice.

280
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,780
Na Eon.

281
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,640
What should we have for lunch?

282
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,870
Oh? Do you want to go to my boyfriend's restaurant?

283
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,680
It's right around the corner. They got a Blue Ribbon recently too.

284
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,290
Enjoy. I have plans.

285
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:33,380
Gosh. What a bummer. I wanted you to meet him.

286
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,380
Sorry. See you later.

287
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,440
- See you. 
 - Bye.

288
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:56,000
Time flies.

289
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,970
You're already out.

290
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:04,190
What did you want to tell me?

291
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,320
I want to stop bothering you.

292
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,990
I'm sorry, Na Eon.

293
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:36,280
Hold on, Jeong Woo.

294
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:05,170
   

295
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:21,570
   

296
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,570
   

297
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,750
Honey.

298
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,250
What's this?

299
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,900
We came by to lift up your spirits.

300
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,980
Charge your energy.

301
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,800
I'm sure Eun Ho will show up soon.

302
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,700
But we should take care of this first.

303
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,420
It's a new business in Seongsu.

304
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:59,780
They insist on having a pop-up at the handmade shoe factory. 
    

305
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,770
The CEO turns out to be a total hottie.

306
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,280
So, I scheduled the meeting immediately.

307
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,450
It's tomorrow morning.

308
00:26:06,450 --> 00:26:07,620
Pardon?

309
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,960
Gosh, how hot is he anyway?

310
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,040
You'll find out once you get there.

311
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:16,660
We'll go and find out.

312
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,860
We'd better go.

313
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:24,980

Seongsu's handmade shoe factory doesn't allow pop-ups.

00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:05,210
We try not to damage Seongsu's original value—

I thought Team Leader Kang did anything for branding.

324
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:20,980
I guess I was wrong.

325
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,350

By the way, President, we're a bit pricey.

331
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:52,250
What will you give me if I work on your branding?

332
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,020
I'll give you everything I have.

333
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,770
Including my soul.

334
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,060
Everything.

335
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:23,000


336
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,760
♫  It was tough being alone  ♫

337
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,740
♫  On the day you left  ♫

338
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,670
♫  I said I'd make you mine for sure  ♫

339
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:39,710
♫  The perfect moment after a long journey as I see you  ♫

340
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:44,270
♫  I have no idea when we got so close  ♫

341
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:49,900
♫  The beginning, it's you ~ Things begin with you  ♫

342
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:54,820
♫  Let's make it exciting, let's color everything  ♫

343
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,370
♫  You'll find out eventually  ♫

344
00:28:57,370 --> 00:29:00,080
   

345
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:04,910
♫  The falling petals are pointing toward you  ♫

346
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,820
♫  It's only for you  ♫
