isn't actually vegan and that it contains animal oil.

20
00:01:54,264 --> 00:01:55,635
When you're successful,

21
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:58,805

39

The thing is, I am one of the potential customers.

40
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:06,774
I could be their prospective customer too, which means...

41
00:03:06,775 --> 00:03:09,344
I see. But it's for women.

42
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:14,344

Look.

44

81
00:07:33,844 --> 00:07:35,875
how would you define brand marketing?

82
00:07:36,344 --> 00:07:39,015
Marketing is all about drawing the distinction...

83
00:07:39,744 --> 00:07:43,755
between your consumers and those who would never buy your brand.

84
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:46,654

I have to say, it looks like the factory is well managed.

183
00:15:02,754 --> 00:15:04,724
Oh, you have a good eye.

184
00:15:05,124 --> 00:15:08,425
We have a factory tour program. We can do it...

185
00:15:09,195 --> 00:15:10,494
because we have nothing to hide.

186
00:15:10,965 --> 00:15:12,565
Be careful. Oh, boy.

187
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:16,874
There.

188
00:15:19,874 --> 00:15:20,874
What?

189
00:15:21,744 --> 00:15:24,244
Do you need hay to make skincare products?

190
00:15:25,984 --> 00:15:26,984
Oh, that.

191
00:15:27,514 --> 00:15:29,254

194
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:39,425
We're going to order jjajangmyeon...

195
00:15:51,374 --> 00:15:52,844
I want eggplant fried rice.

196
00:15:57,675 --> 00:15:59,915
- Can I order Mapo tofu too? - Of course, you can.

197
00:16:00,215 --> 00:16:01,215
Let's go.

198
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:15,624
(You have a new message.)

199
00:16:16,035 --> 00:16:17,594
Mapo tofu, score!

200
00:16:18,264 --> 00:16:20,504
Thanks to you, I'm having this feast. Thank you.

201
00:16:21,205 --> 00:16:22,774
Gosh, it's so good.

202
00:16:23,134 --> 00:16:24,304

00:16:39,854 --> 00:16:41,624
About that guy yesterday.

207
00:16:42,524 --> 00:16:43,994
He won't cause trouble, will he?

208
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:46,425
Thanks to you, he won't.

209
00:16:46,825 --> 00:16:50,035
I think he's become your fan after meeting you in person yesterday.

210
00:16:50,335 --> 00:16:51,394
Oh, boy.

211
00:16:51,965 --> 00:16:53,705
I don't swing that way.

212
00:16:55,405 --> 00:16:56,535
But...

213
00:16:58,504 --> 00:16:59,945
about XU Beauty.

214
00:17:00,504 --> 00:17:02,004
You're sure there won't be any problems, right?

215
00:17:02,915 --> 00:17:04,115
Is that important?

216
00:17:05,675 --> 00:17:07,014
Soon,

217
00:17:07,215 --> 00:17:10,215
I'll have a lunch meeting with the vice chairman of Segye Group.

218
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,385
I'll be sure...

219
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:15,855
to put in a good word for you.

220
00:17:17,925 --> 00:17:19,324
Isn't this what matters?

221
00:17:21,925 --> 00:17:24,034
Yes, that's important. Very important.

222
00:17:24,734 --> 00:17:27,834
All right, then. I trust that you'll be well-prepared.

Well...

227
00:18:09,514 --> 00:18:10,715
It looks nice and simple.

228
00:18:11,474 --> 00:18:13,513
As for the public invitation, we can go with this.

229

For VIPs and celebrities,

230
00:18:15,415 --> 00:18:16,415
we'll use this.

231
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:19,114
Print only a few.

232
00:18:19,115 --> 00:18:21,754
Right, because rarity creates value.

233
00:18:22,054 --> 00:18:23,224
Oh, my.

234
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:26,324
I wish everyone on my team was like you.

No.

236

Hey, Na Eon.

238
00:18:35,034 --> 00:18:37,135
What if we could make this even more special?

241
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,824
Their main product is the hydrating cream that contains deep sea water,

242
00:18:59,254 --> 00:19:00,564
so I used my brain a little.

243
00:19:06,504 --> 00:19:07,534
I like it.

248
00:19:22,445 --> 00:19:24,915
By the way, how come you're still single?

249
00:19:26,014 --> 00:19:27,084
You'd better find someone soon,

- Jung Woo. - Yes?

252

There are many suspicious things about them.

296

I'll start with a question.

306
00:26:22,304 --> 00:26:23,833
You want to be number one in the industry,

307
00:26:23,834 --> 00:26:25,634
but you and your competitor...

308
00:26:25,635 --> 00:26:27,605
have similar marketing budgets and models.

309
00:26:27,974 --> 00:26:31,175
Then what can you do to win?

310
00:26:33,584 --> 00:26:36,314
How can you beat your competitor who's on par with you?

311
00:26:36,655 --> 00:26:37,784
Does any of you know the answer?

312
00:26:40,484 --> 00:26:41,584
You, the one who's late.

313
00:26:45,294 --> 00:26:47,125
- Me? - What's your answer?

314
00:26:47,724 --> 00:26:50,264
Well, I'm not late.

315
00:26:50,665 --> 00:26:52,594
The lecture begins at 2pm. It's 1:55pm now.

316
00:26:52,595 --> 00:26:54,935
All right. Just now, I bet all of you were thinking,

317
00:26:55,105 --> 00:26:57,675
"He's making excuses when he's late."

318
00:26:57,935 --> 00:27:00,405
Although he's not actually late.

319
00:27:03,274 --> 00:27:04,345
This is...

320
00:27:05,474 --> 00:27:06,544
not fair.
