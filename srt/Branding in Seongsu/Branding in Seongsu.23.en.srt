What on earth...

6
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:14,003
is this?

7
00:00:14,474 --> 00:00:17,073
The traces were removed.

8
00:00:17,674 --> 00:00:19,704
In the best way possible for that person.

9
00:00:20,044 --> 00:00:21,643
This is insane.

10
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:24,384
Hand this over to the police right away.

11
00:00:25,684 --> 00:00:26,684
Well...

12
00:00:27,884 --> 00:00:29,053
I'll meet that person myself.

13
00:00:30,154 --> 00:00:31,224
No.

14
00:00:31,953 --> 00:00:33,383
I can't let you be in danger.

15
00:00:35,324 --> 00:00:36,423
Why would I be in danger?

16
00:00:37,764 --> 00:00:40,394
I have you by my side now.

17
00:01:13,563 --> 00:01:15,563
The rabbit that tried to kill me...

18
00:01:16,694 --> 00:01:17,733
was Cha Jung Woo.

19
00:01:22,274 --> 00:01:23,404
That means...

20
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:40,952
(Kim Ji Eun, Lomon)

21
00:01:40,953 --> 00:01:42,194
(Yang Hye Ji, Kim Ho Young)

22

(Branding in Seongsu)

23
00:02:03,343 --> 00:02:06,884
There's a lot more to remove other than that.

24
00:02:07,183 --> 00:02:10,384
It would be great if my seniors would help.

25
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:12,884
- No. - No.

26
00:02:12,983 --> 00:02:16,023
You have to do well with removing to be great in art.

27
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,723
When Manager Cha was a newbie,

28
00:02:17,724 --> 00:02:20,522
there's a legend that he removed over 200 people.

29
00:02:20,523 --> 00:02:23,393
Then shall we move them over to Manager Cha?

30
00:02:25,303 --> 00:02:27,104
I can't believe the Gen MZers these days.

31
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,303
You're going to make Manager Cha do the removing?

32
00:02:29,534 --> 00:02:30,673
What's wrong with that?

33
00:02:30,803 --> 00:02:33,272
If a teammate needs help, I must help.

34
00:02:33,273 --> 00:02:35,414
Manager Cha!

35
00:02:35,743 --> 00:02:37,313
Look at these edges.

36
00:02:37,314 --> 00:02:40,683
The people and the background keep colliding. I can't do anything.

37
00:02:41,113 --> 00:02:42,183
When that's the case,

38
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:46,284
don't think of it as removing. Think of it as filling it in.

39
00:02:46,724 --> 00:02:49,224
It's hard to make it look empty,

40
00:02:49,594 --> 00:02:52,124
but it's always fun to create something new.

41
00:02:58,034 --> 00:02:59,803
- The background? - Just a moment.

42
00:03:00,504 --> 00:03:03,133
- Try creating things. - Right.

43
00:03:03,134 --> 00:03:04,604
- Cha Jung Woo. - Hey, Na Eon.

44
00:03:05,243 --> 00:03:06,673
You're going to come to the reunion, right?

45
00:03:08,914 --> 00:03:10,474
The wedding invitation looks pretty.

46
00:03:11,143 --> 00:03:13,083
- Congratulations. - Thanks.

47
00:03:13,243 --> 00:03:15,453
You guys are the best.

48
00:03:15,884 --> 00:03:17,113
Are you not seeing anyone, Yoo Mi?

49
00:03:17,354 --> 00:03:18,423
Me?

50
00:03:20,254 --> 00:03:22,294
It's always the same for me.

51
00:03:23,393 --> 00:03:24,422
What about you, Na Eon?

52
00:03:24,423 --> 00:03:26,023
I have a boyfriend.

53
00:03:27,194 --> 00:03:28,264
Really?

54
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:31,203
Yes. We're in the same company and the same team.

55
00:03:32,403 --> 00:03:33,504
It's So Eun Ho.

56
00:03:34,903 --> 00:03:36,173
Who's So Eun Ho?

57
00:03:51,624 --> 00:03:53,223
- I'll see you then. - Okay. Make sure to come.

58
00:03:53,224 --> 00:03:54,224
Okay.

59
00:03:58,724 --> 00:03:59,764
Hey, Cha Jung Woo.

60
00:04:00,164 --> 00:04:02,794
Do you want to go to Da Yeon's wedding with me?

61
00:04:04,393 --> 00:04:05,733
Why do you like me?

62
00:04:08,974 --> 00:04:10,004
I'm not sure.

63
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:25,054
Where are you, Na Eon?

64
00:04:26,223 --> 00:04:27,424
You're okay, right?

65
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,103
There will be some movement for sure.

66
00:04:40,903 --> 00:04:41,973
Don't worry.

67
00:04:42,574 --> 00:04:45,004
Being in danger means...

68
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,653
there will be...

69
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:58,054
a lot to earn.

70
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:10,364
You're here.

71
00:05:18,074 --> 00:05:19,403
You came a lot faster than I thought.

72
00:05:35,353 --> 00:05:36,523
Do it again.

73
00:05:38,163 --> 00:05:39,223
You...

74
00:05:40,824 --> 00:05:42,264
tried to kill me.

75
00:05:48,103 --> 00:05:50,273
What? Is that it?

76
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:51,773
Keep going.

77
00:05:52,543 --> 00:05:53,643
Are you afraid?

78
00:05:55,244 --> 00:05:56,244
Right.

79
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:00,484
Was it that you weren't trying to kill me?

80
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:03,283
Were you...

81
00:06:04,184 --> 00:06:05,653
trying to get me?

82
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:09,994
Na Eon!

83
00:06:18,163 --> 00:06:19,333
Are you okay, Na Eon?

84
00:06:28,674 --> 00:06:29,744
Stop.

85
00:06:35,014 --> 00:06:36,114
Cha Jung Woo.

86
00:06:43,494 --> 00:06:44,764
Since when did you know?

87
00:06:47,124 --> 00:06:48,694
I found it in the art room.

88
00:06:58,603 --> 00:06:59,773
If you...

89
00:07:01,574 --> 00:07:03,543
had accepted me at least once,

90
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,384
this would've never happened.

91
00:07:07,184 --> 00:07:08,283
Just once.

92
00:07:08,884 --> 00:07:10,014
Really?

93
00:07:11,783 --> 00:07:14,153
Was it really because I didn't accept you?

94
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:20,523
No. The Cha Jung Woo I know...

95
00:07:21,124 --> 00:07:22,494
isn't like this.

96
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:26,402
You're not someone...

97
00:07:26,403 --> 00:07:28,533
who would break down like this for not getting me.

98
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:38,884
Who is it?

99
00:07:41,014 --> 00:07:42,754
Who made you like this?

100
00:07:50,953 --> 00:07:52,694
I know everything, so just tell me.

101
00:07:55,134 --> 00:07:56,734
I was told...

102
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,633
you would look at me once you hit rock bottom.

103
00:07:59,634 --> 00:08:01,374
That was why I just threatened you.

104
00:08:02,574 --> 00:08:04,403
So who was it?

105
00:08:07,273 --> 00:08:08,473
People say...

106
00:08:09,413 --> 00:08:12,213
Na Eon resembles me.

107
00:08:16,184 --> 00:08:17,254
But that's not true.

108
00:08:17,554 --> 00:08:19,853
The one that resembles me the most...

109
00:08:20,424 --> 00:08:21,694
is you, Yoo Mi.

110
00:08:32,033 --> 00:08:33,104
I think we will...

111
00:08:34,663 --> 00:08:37,173
become great partners.

112
00:08:48,454 --> 00:08:49,484
Was it Min Hee Jung?

113
00:09:03,234 --> 00:09:04,834
But still,

114
00:09:05,663 --> 00:09:07,563
Na Eon can get hurt from that.

115
00:09:09,104 --> 00:09:12,443
Or you can just watch her from far away.

116
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,073
What if Na Eon...

117
00:09:15,643 --> 00:09:17,673
becomes someone you can't even reach?

118
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:19,514
What will you do then?

119
00:09:21,754 --> 00:09:23,283
Just scare her a bit.

120
00:09:23,913 --> 00:09:26,023
And show up like a guardian.

121
00:09:26,124 --> 00:09:27,922
Just as if it was destiny,

122
00:09:27,923 --> 00:09:29,494
you can show up in front of her.

123
00:09:29,693 --> 00:09:31,253
This makes no sense.

124
00:09:31,254 --> 00:09:34,594
Make sure Kang Na Eon feels...

125
00:09:34,933 --> 00:09:36,494
she belongs to you.

126
00:09:42,734 --> 00:09:43,933
So...

127
00:09:45,303 --> 00:09:48,513
you trusted Min Hee Jung's words that you could get me...

128
00:09:48,514 --> 00:09:50,413
if I hit rock bottom.

129
00:09:51,273 --> 00:09:52,384
And...

130
00:09:54,384 --> 00:09:55,754
you tried to kill me?

131
00:09:56,954 --> 00:09:58,884
I wasn't trying to kill you.

132
00:10:01,693 --> 00:10:02,724
Trust me.

133
00:10:07,764 --> 00:10:09,964
I don't need an apology or an excuse from you.

134
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:13,334
I'm a fool for keeping you around as a friend...

135
00:10:16,234 --> 00:10:19,303
who falls for those kinds of words.

136
00:10:24,844 --> 00:10:26,084
Get out.

137
00:10:26,614 --> 00:10:27,614
Na Eon.

138
00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:31,553
If we let him go like this, we will never know what he might do again.

139
00:10:33,153 --> 00:10:34,724
If he had the guts to do that,

140
00:10:36,423 --> 00:10:37,653
he would've never done this.

141
00:10:58,714 --> 00:10:59,984
Will it be okay?

142
00:11:03,214 --> 00:11:04,683
If it's the Cha Jung Woo I know.

143
00:11:13,393 --> 00:11:14,464
Breaking news.

144
00:11:14,693 --> 00:11:16,562
There have been rumors spreading about Segye Group's Hwang Je Ha...

145
00:11:16,563 --> 00:11:18,733
having a child born out of wedlock.

146
00:11:18,734 --> 00:11:20,432
- And Segye International's... - Hwang Je Ha?

147
00:11:20,433 --> 00:11:22,572
Stock price has recorded the lowest price.

148
00:11:22,573 --> 00:11:23,704
Na Eon.

149
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,142
What is this all about all of a sudden?

150
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,443
Nothing is being said about these claims.

151
00:11:27,573 --> 00:11:30,042
There have been many women...

152
00:11:30,043 --> 00:11:32,714
that claim to be Hwang Je Ha's secret mistress.

(Director Hwang Je Ha is Embroiled in Drug Controversy)

155
00:11:45,793 --> 00:11:47,523
Right at this moment,

156
00:11:48,634 --> 00:11:50,734
an issue with Hwang Je Ha breaks out?

157
00:11:53,264 --> 00:11:55,173
Just like five years ago.

158
00:11:58,744 --> 00:11:59,874
The method...

159
00:12:02,014 --> 00:12:03,913
just never changes.

160
00:12:14,384 --> 00:12:15,454
Oh, my gosh.

161
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,422
I have a child out of wedlock? I feel...

162
00:12:18,423 --> 00:12:19,423
wronged.

163
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:20,793
Well,

164
00:12:21,264 --> 00:12:23,393
someone has really decided to go against me.

165
00:12:23,834 --> 00:12:26,333
Hurry up and post up the explanatory articles!

166
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:28,263
No one will believe it.

167
00:12:28,264 --> 00:12:30,533
- What? - Whether it be true or false,

168
00:12:31,474 --> 00:12:33,874
no one will care.

169
00:12:34,173 --> 00:12:36,543
The image people want from you...

170
00:12:36,943 --> 00:12:38,783
has been thrown out like fodder.

171
00:12:38,813 --> 00:12:41,182
The media can't have enough of it.

172
00:12:41,183 --> 00:12:43,653
Yes. You're right.

173
00:12:46,423 --> 00:12:47,523
But...

174
00:12:49,494 --> 00:12:51,923
this feels so similar with five years ago.

175

176
00:13:02,273 --> 00:13:04,103
You know that...

177
00:13:04,104 --> 00:13:05,104
it isn't me.

178
00:13:05,173 --> 00:13:07,043
Whether it be true or false,

179
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,474
no one will care.

180
00:13:09,874 --> 00:13:11,474
Entertainment is all they need.

181
00:13:11,943 --> 00:13:14,183
A way to cover up a controversy...

182
00:13:14,443 --> 00:13:16,683
is by coming up with a greater controversy.

183
00:13:20,183 --> 00:13:22,494
Leave it to me. But...

184
00:13:22,854 --> 00:13:24,293
it's under one condition.

185
00:13:27,163 --> 00:13:29,264
I will make a greater incident...

186
00:13:29,634 --> 00:13:32,803
than your drug issue.

I wish my position to be...

193
00:13:52,923 --> 00:13:54,624
much higher than now.

194

- Do we not have anything? - Are you okay?

199
00:14:23,384 --> 00:14:27,653
Even then, people wanted every part of me.

200
00:14:28,283 --> 00:14:30,124
And you saved me.

220

The thing you need the most now is...

221
00:16:06,124 --> 00:16:07,984
The brands that Director Hwang released.

222
00:16:09,793 --> 00:16:11,453
Have you gathered together the rebranding ideas?

223
00:16:11,454 --> 00:16:13,624
But Ms. Kim, you mentioned this out of the blue, so...

224
00:16:16,764 --> 00:16:19,133
From Director Hwang in his mother's womb and until now,

225

228
00:16:26,604 --> 00:16:28,672
I have put together all of Director Hwang's social media...

229
00:16:28,673 --> 00:16:30,672
and other Internet usage records...

00:16:30,673 --> 00:16:32,283

Right.

237

We don't even know what will happen to his brands. Why...

238
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:55,504
There will be...

239
00:16:56,004 --> 00:16:57,673
a time when we will need it.

240
00:16:58,334 --> 00:16:59,374
