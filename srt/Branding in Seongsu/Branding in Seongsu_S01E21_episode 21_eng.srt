1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,400
   

2
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,210
Sir.

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,250
This is Director Han.

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,860
- Nice to meet you. 
 - Hello.

5
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:22,820
- Please have a seat. 
 - Okay.

6
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:25,860
   

7
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:30,900
I heard Segye International and Seongsu Agency are having a grand duel today.

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,930
I'm sorry we're taking the family fight too far.

9
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,080
Not at all.

10
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:38,440
It's not like our liquid hydrogen technology is running away.

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:42,940
I don't think it'll cost us, no matter who wins.

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,240
What happened?

13
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,030
Is it over just like this?

14
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:51,280
It's over if Team Leader Kang has no solution.

15
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,900
What do we do?

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,050
Eun Ho Honey?

17
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,750
You told me to come at you. What happened to that?

18
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:07,920
You said we should fight fair and square.

19
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,110
How did you get this...

20
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:22,490
Having enemies on all sides is more difficult than it seems.

21
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:28,380
You have to do anything it takes to achieve your goal.

22
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,610
   

23
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,570
Use this for the presentation.

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,590
Why are you giving this to me?

25
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:44,660
Because you're Kang Na Eon now.

26
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,700
It's not for you. It's for me.

27
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:53,980
Director Han said there's evidence to incriminate you in here.

28
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:59,370
If I get punished for this,

29
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,420
I'm sure that would be good for me too.

30
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:19,950


31
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,470
High Jet? It's not for HQ Motors.

32
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,440
Why did Eun Ho Honey bring this... 
    

33
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,050
   

34
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,710
   

35
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,580
   

36
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,050
   

37
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,220
   

38
00:02:54,540 --> 00:03:00,420
   

39
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:06,930
Seongsu Agency's Team Leader Kang will start the presentation.

40
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,380
Team Leader Kang.

41
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,770
Team Leader Kang!

42
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:14,890
Team Leader Kang?

43
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,510
Looks like something's happened to her.

44
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:21,390
Let's start with Team Leader So—

45
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,340
No, we can't do that.

46
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:27,330
Shouldn't she be disqualified at this point?

47
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,200
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,350
There was a delay due to a minor issue.

49
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,550
I'll start the presentation immediately.

50
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,130
Jenny.

51
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,470
   

52
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,190
   

53
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:59,390
Do you see the company name High Jet right here?

54
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:00,620
What's this?

55
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,190
High Jet is the company that invented

56
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,000
the first liquid hydrogen battery for commercial vehicles

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,920
in South Korea.

58
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,420
But why is HQ Motors, not High Jet,

59
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,530
that holds the title of the first company that is

60
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:16,380
commercializing liquid hydrogen batteries in the country?

61
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,710
Make her stop immediately.

62
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:19,820
- Okay, got it. 
 - Got it.

63
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,840
- Oh, my! Where are you going in the middle of the presentation? 
 - You can't leave.

64
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:26,020
- No, no. 
 - What are you doing? Stop him.

65
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,280
To get to the bottom of the liquid hydrogen battery case,

66
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,920
we met with President Choi Chang Joo.

67
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:42,950
Looks like there's a technical difficulty. We'll pause the presentation for now—

68
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:45,020
No, it's okay.

69
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,790
Things like this happen all the time in large-scale presentations.

70
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:55,980
I ask you to focus on what I'm saying from now on.

71
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,640
There once was a boy who loved cars at an early age.

72
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,400
 Here we go. 

73
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,560
 He was greatly influenced by his father who worked at a car repair shop. 

74
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:09,890
 As a son worthy of his father's pride, 

75
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:12,600
 he developed the nation's first liquid hydrogen battery. 

76
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,350
 It worked! 

77
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,620
 He was about to make them available for commercial vehicles, 

78
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:22,860
 but no one paid attention to the president of a small company with a disability. 
   

79
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,000
 Although High Jet was the first company in Korea to develop 

80
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,360
 the liquid hydrogen battery, for lacking capital and power, 

81
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,620
 they failed to commercialize them. 

82
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,980
Stop talking nonsense now.

83
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,590
It's not nonsense at all.

84
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:39,250
High Jet?

85
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:42,990
Where's the evidence that they developed liquid hydrogen batteries?

86
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:48,640
Please look toward the entrance.

87
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:02,530
This is High Jet's first generation liquid hydrogen vehicle. 
    

88
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,240
And he's President Choi Chang Joo, the first person who developed

89
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,280
the liquid hydrogen battery in Korea.

90
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,280
C-Chang Joo likes cars.

91
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:19,430
We don't want to advertise the first liquid hydrogen battery in Korea,

92
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:26,460
because the title of being the first doesn't hold power and can easily be stolen.

93
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:31,300
Instead, we want to market President Choi's story.

94
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,600
Are you joking?

95
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,930
It's just a small company with a mentally challenged president after all.

96
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,050
He can't do anything if we don't do anything.

97
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:42,260
I'm not telling you to do anything.

98
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:45,060
I'm asking HQ Motors...

99
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,420
to buy High Jet's failure story.

100
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:04,870
This is the branding I suggest for HQ Motors.

101
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,660
   

102
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,720
   

103
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,820
   

104
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,240
Although High Jet lacked power and capital,

105
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,720
they certainly weren't lacking in technology.

106
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,990
If HQ Motors invests in them fairly,

107
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:29,450
it will be more valuable than an ad campaign that costs hundreds of millions.

108
00:07:29,450 --> 00:07:32,510
President, this is a ridiculous accusation.

109
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,320
HQ developed the liquid hydrogen battery ourselves—

110
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,290
How interesting.

111
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,590
Whether we developed it or not,

112
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,080
I want to buy High Jet's story.

113
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,920
First of all, if we indeed stole from them,

114
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:53,430
we have to find the culprit first.

115
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,780
Well, the thing is—

116
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,330
Segye Group is taking care of the technology theft issues internally.

117
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,290
Please don't worry.

118
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,910
♫  Walk steadily just like as Rocky  ♫ 
  ♫  The windy road doesn't affect me at all  ♫

119
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,640
When I first met President Choi Chang Joo,

120
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:26,360
I noticed he knew Director Han very well.

121
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,850
 This car can drive for 100 km with a liquid hydrogen battery this big. 

122
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:34,060
♫  Like a protagonist who comes back to life, so I...  ♫ 
 ♫  He feels dizzy, but he gets up  ♫

123
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:35,590
   

124
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:40,610
 According to my research, Director Han 

125
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:46,140
stole the High Jet branding request for Seongsu Agency.

126
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,900
 Look at this. We could hit the jackpot. 

127
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,390
 Hyungnim, I think we could work together on this. 

128
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:00,610
President, he threatened me using their connection with HQ Motors.

129
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,280
What kind of nonsense is that right now?

130
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,210
I said there's a company developing something similar that are ahead of us.

131
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:09,740
So I was telling you to be careful—

132
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,640
Don't you understand branding? Branding?

133
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,600
You received quite a bit of money for working on the branding.

134
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,140
What?

135
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:19,600
   

136
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,880
What are you doing right now?

137
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,330
I'm presenting...

138
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:29,870
so HQ Motors could become a better brand.

139
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,650
It's branding.

140
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,500
What are you doing right now?

141
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,390
You said you were curious to see

142
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,870
the look on Kang Na Eon's face.

143
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:52,630
I always make the same face in front of you.

144
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,530
It's the look of pity.

145
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:00,320
You bastard. What are you doing right now? Huh?

146
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,340
Okay, okay.

147
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,060
Director Han, please stop the commotion.

148
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,540
Segye International said they're investigating,

149
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,800
but this involves us too.

150
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,770
Let's resolve it together.

151
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:19,890
I'll contact you regarding the High Jet project once everything is sorted out.

152
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:21,540
See you later.

153
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,250
Well... President.

154
00:10:37,490 --> 00:10:40,260
You've been going through a lot.

155
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,010
Everything will get resolved soon.

156
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:44,140
T-Thank you.

157
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,560
B-But it was nice that the handsome Hyung helped me.

158
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,590
You mean Eun Ho?

159
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:55,730
Guys, let's drive President Choi back.

160
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,150
- Yes, yes. 
 - Team Leader, you can rest.

161
00:10:57,150 --> 00:10:59,150
Yes, yes. Take it easy.

162
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,800
- Let's go. Let's go. 
 - Have you eaten?

163
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,020
Shall we talk?

164
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:22,020
Don't mistake yourself for a good person because of this.

165
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:26,300
Don't think I forgave you, either.

166
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,970
You can give me my body back, can't you?

167
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,310
What are you doing right now?

168
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:54,090
We'll find out tomorrow.

169
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:58,660
What are you doing—

170
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,140
Taking it with me is the same as giving it to you.

171
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,660
♫  My days and nights are all about you  ♫

172
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,810
♫  So much so that I forget myself  ♫

173
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:30,930
♫  So will you stay with me?   ♫

174
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:38,040
♫  You've taken over my heart, my thoughts and everything I am   ♫

175
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:40,550
♫  So can you give me just this one chance?  ♫

176
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,860
 Sunbae, you haven't had dinner, right? 

177
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,560
 Coffee is not food, okay? 

178
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,030
 Who takes care of you when I'm not around? 

179
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,860
♫  Hidden in the words, I wrote and erased again  ♫

180
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:59,950
♫  Because you were in all of them  ♫

181
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:02,000
 Why aren't you coming? 

182
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,040
 Right. It's because it's dark? 

183
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,890
♫  Because I've waited for you for so long  ♫

184
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,940
♫  I'll have no regrets in this moment  ♫

185
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,220
 Come on. 

186
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,910
 Let's eat. 

187
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:27,450
♫  The beginning of all of my seasons becomes clearer because of you  ♫

188
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:31,870
♫  Can you spare me just a glance?  ♫

189
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:35,060
♫  I'm pouring my heart out  ♫

190
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:39,020
♫  It's within me now  ♫

191
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:42,460
♫  You are my all  ♫

192
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,250
Am I...

193
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,010
actually back?

194
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:27,660
 The incident from five years ago. 

195
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,630
 What's the truth behind it? 

196
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,500
 The truth is... 

197
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,110
 quite simple. 

198
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:38,530
 The one who's responsible for everything. Team Leader Kang Na Eon. 

199
00:14:48,670 --> 00:14:52,180
   

200
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,600
   

201
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,600
 What makes Bandi Candle stand out? 

202
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,010
 The scents are nice. 

203
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,740
 I see. Could you be a little more specific? 

204
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,970
 It's a trade secret. 

205
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:22,000
 You take trade secrets very seriously. 

206
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,060
 I'm impressed. 

207
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,520
 Bandi Candle is an eco-friendly candle making project that uses 

208
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,230
 traditional Korean perfume making techniques. 

209
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:45,740
 "Bandi" comes from the word "firefly light," a natural source of light. Is that correct? 

210
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,520
Na Eon Sunbae?

211
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:08,200
 I'm Kang Na Eon, the brand marketer of Segye Group's marketing HQ. 

212
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:13,860
 I'm making this video to reveal the truth about the Bandi Candle project. 

213
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:20,220
 While working on the branding for Charmant Candle, Segye Group's in-house candle brand, 

214
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,600
 I learned about Bandi Candle. 

215
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:35,050
 I tried to release Charmant Candle by collaborating with Bandi Candle, 

216
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:39,480
 but while I was working on the project, 

217
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,250
 Segye Group removed the Bandi Candle brand. 

218
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,090
 I made it clear that this is a collaboration. 

219
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:46,440
 But why are you playing ignorant now— 

220
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,040
 They're trying to jeopardize the HQ Marketing Team. 

221
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,860
 Pay no attention and proceed as planned. 

222
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,780
 I'll be responsible if anything happens. 

223
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:05,050
 I was the person in charge of Charmant Candle, 

224
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:07,810
 but I didn't prevent this from happening 

225
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:09,780
 and I played ignorant. 

226
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:23,770
 Sunbae, I don't think I can do this. 

227
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:32,460
 If someone from Bandi Candle sees this video, 

228
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,830
 I'd like to tell you this 

229
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:38,370
 so shamelessly. 

230
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:47,970
 It was a great project and branding plan. 

231
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:51,080
 I apologize once again. 

232
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,030
This...

233
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,460
What is this?

234
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,390
What am I supposed to do after seeing that video?

235
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:02,890
You want me to use this...

236
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:06,340
to reveal to the world that it was your fault?

237
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,160
Isn't that what you wanted to do?

238
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:12,320
No.

239
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,980
I...

240
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:19,760
thought a sincere apology...

241
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,170
would be enough.

242
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,840
But...

243
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:29,600
if you had already apologized, then...

244
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:33,110
what am I supposed to do now?

245
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,650
But why...

246
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,710
I don't know anymore.

247
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,120
I really don't know.

248
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,510
So Eun Ho.

249
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,380
So Eun Ho!

250
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,910
 Segye International Director Han Yi Jae 

251
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:36,750
 is being investigated internally for intellectual property theft. 

252
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,320
 Regarding this case, some think there needs to be 

253
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:46,120
 a new bill regarding corporates stealing startups' intellectual property. 

254
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:49,480
Aigoo, Director Han.

255
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,590
Hold on.

256
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,420
You're Mr. Han Yi Jae now.

257
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,900
Leave quietly.

258
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,640
HQ Motors has decided to work with High Jet from now on.

259
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,360
 HQ Motors released an official apology for stealing High Jet's intellectual property 

260
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,700
 and by actively investing in High Jet, 

261
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:09,250
 they promised to strengthen the bond between corporates and startups. 

262
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,260
 And according to an employee from Segye Group, 
   

263
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,180
 Segye Group is considering promoting 

264
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:18,350
 Team Leader Kang Na Eon for making this possible. 

265
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,600
Why am I tearing up, by the way? 
    

266
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,670
We're joining Team 1?

267
00:21:35,230 --> 00:21:36,500
Pardon?

268
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,200
Do you want us to be in charge of regularly scheduled workshops?

269
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,190
Yes. Is there a problem with that?

270
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,630
 Not at all! 

271
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:48,610
I'll be looking forward to it. Yeong Ae Sunbaenim.

272
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,650
I'll do my best!

273
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:56,860
- Yes, I'll do my best. 
 - Thank you.

274
00:22:01,190 --> 00:22:05,220
The entire staff needs to attend no matter what.

275
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,580
Entire staff. Workshop. Yes, Ma'am.

276
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,800
- Let's go, let's go. 
-  What's wrong with you?

277
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,980
Workshops are so freaking boring.

278
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,470
I know.

279
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,200
Quiet!

280
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,410
Rex, ask the art team to prepare images for the workshop.

281
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:28,460
Jenny, do research on social media and prepare a game for the workshop.

282
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,880
And Eun Ho...

283
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:35,790
Eun Ho. Didn't he join Team 1 with us?

284
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,940
Yes.

285
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,060
But I haven't seen him since the HQ Motors presentation.

286
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,910
Hey, call him right now.

287
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:44,250
Gosh, I'm sure he has a reason.

288
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:47,720
You can't just say, "He has a reason."

289
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:51,090
I said "Yes, Ma'am" when Team Leader Kang said we needed the entire staff.

290
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:54,430
What if Eun Ho doesn't show up? What would happen?

291
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,780
Will we get sent back to the basement?

292
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,870
Call him. Call him quickly.

293
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,660
He's not answering.

294
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:27,030
 You said you'll send the evidence. What's going on? 

295
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,850
 I'll send the draft of the Kang Na Eon article for now. 

296
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,530
   

297
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,620
 This is where Eun Ho lives, huh? 

298
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,930
 It looks like there are bugs. 

299
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:52,730
 Gosh, it's too far away. I'm so tired. 

300
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,620
- So— 
 - My gosh!

301
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,960
Sorry to stop by so late.

302
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,050
- We're seriously so disappointed. 
 - You're too much.

303
00:24:03,050 --> 00:24:06,460
These days, the kids freak out when they hear the word workshop.

304
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:08,800
Of course. You're always forced to drink.

305
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:11,380
Gosh, should we have an alcohol-free workshop?

306
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,360
Did you hear that?

307
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,270
Will you keep hanging out here?

308
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:17,940
Of course.

309
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,890
Please leave.

310
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,260
Should we knock him out?

311
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,950
Or should we get him drunk and unconscious?

312
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,280
Rex, knock him over.

313
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,710
I told you to leave.

314
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,440
He said leave.

315
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:54,130
 The fact that Director Han didn't try to kill me when he reached rock bottom 

316
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,280
 means he's not the culprit. 

317
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,560
 Who could it have been then? 

318
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:13,040
 I've gone through hell for several years because of you. 

319
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,800
 I'm so glad you lived though. 

320
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,620
 Pardon? 

321
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,040
 If you died, 

322
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,780
 I would have been the culprit. 

323
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:27,820
 Someone who resents me because of the incident five years ago. 

324
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,850
 And... 

325
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,400
 the person who took responsibility for everything. 

326
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,270
 I made it clear that this is a collaboration. 

327
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,840
 But why are you playing ignorant now— 

328
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,500
 Na Eon, 

329
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:53,510
 pay no attention and proceed as planned. 

330
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:56,970
 I'll be responsible if anything happens. 

331
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,940
 Are you admitting to the fact that you copied? 

332
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:04,140
 Segye Group never stole startups' intellectual property. 

333
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,860
 Sunbae. 

334
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,390
 What if the two... 

335
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:20,010
 had the same goal? 

336
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:29,150
   

337
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,870
Nice.

338
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:47,180
Isn't it about time Seongsu Agency

339
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,670
returns to Segye Group?

340
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,510
Instead of continuing to fight among family.

341
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,980
I agree.

342
00:26:53,980 --> 00:27:00,710
Merging will help Segye International's stock price go up greatly.

343
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,050
Since we're on the topic...

344
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:07,280
Kang Na Eon. I don't particularly like her,

345
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:10,160
but she's really popular right now.

346
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:14,240
What if we make her the youngest executive when we merge?

347
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:18,440
It will create a lot more buzz than what you just said.

348
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,420
Gosh!

349
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:24,170
Of course, I'll...

350
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:26,640
set some extra aside for you.

351
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:37,860


352
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:44,090
   

353
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,750
♫  Walk steadily just like as Rocky  ♫

354
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,370
♫  The windy road doesn't affect me at all  ♫

355
00:27:57,370 --> 00:28:01,230
♫  I don't even flinch, I was born to be a warrior  ♫

356
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:05,320
♫  You've seen it at least once  ♫

357
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,460
♫  Like a protagonist who comes back to life  ♫

358
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,320
♫  He feels dizzy, but he gets up  ♫

359
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:19,350
♫  You say this is enough and what's pleasant is better&lt;  ♫

360
00:28:19,350 --> 00:28:23,500
♫  Burn it, throw everything, like a fire  ♫

361
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,420
♫  I'm breaking rocks  ♫

362
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,620
♫  I'm breaking rocks  ♫
