1
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:07,250
   

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:09,900
 The handmade shoe district in Seongsu-dong. 

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:14,000
 The purchase of the first generation handmade shoe factory that has been around 

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,210
 for decades was dramatically settled. 

5
00:00:16,210 --> 00:00:18,050
 It was once an industrial district, 

6
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,090
 but as it transitioned into a space where industry and culture co-exist, 

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,200
   

8
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,580
 XU Beauty's brand pop-up store is opening in Seongsu's central location 

9
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:31,290
 and its course of action as a brand that's leading K-beauty's globalization 

10
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:34,850
 has been at the center of the public's attention. 

11
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:51,590


12
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,130
   

13
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:09,900
   

14
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,750
   

15
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,190
   

16
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,510
   

17
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:34,590
   

18
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:45,610
   

19
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,220
   

20
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,320
   

21
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,020
   

22
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,970
   

23
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,330
   

24
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,250
   

25
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:16,060
   

26
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,270
- You made it, President. 
 - Yes.

27
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,470
This is impressive.

28
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:35,470
Of course.

29
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,280
Let's go.

30
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:43,480
We incorporated the steel facade on the exterior of the handmade shoe factory

31
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,370
and decorated it so that it accentuates the original material.

32
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:52,140
I didn't think you'd decorate it this way.

33
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,060
It's interesting.

34
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:00,580
You probably saw it on the way up.

35
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:03,670
But in order to emphasize our eco concept,

36
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:07,880
we recreated trees and a forest using plants.

37
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,220
Let's check out the inside.

38
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:37,020
 Hello. 

39
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,570
- Hello. 
 - Welcome.

40
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,980
The core concept of this pop-up is the "Five Senses."

41
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:52,550
We let people experience XU Beauty's new products with five senses.

42
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:54,400
On the second floor, we used media art

43
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,640
to make you feel like you're in a forest.

44
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,860
Come this way, please.

45
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,020
What's that?

46
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,360
Shall we go downstairs?

47
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:33,850
The first floor attracts customers to a mysterious nature scene.

48
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:46,430
- Wow. Look at this. 
 - This is so pretty.

49
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:49,500
This is so cool.

50
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:08,470
It's the mysterious... ocean.

51
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:25,340
This is... so you, Team Leader Kang.

52
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:33,240
This moisturizing cream made with distilled deep-sea water is the main product, right?

53
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:37,240
Looks like you'll soon...

54
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,410
be joining Segye Group's HQ.

55
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,740
You're too kind.

56
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,790
 XU Beauty's pop-up has been creating a lot of buzz since the first day it opened. 

57
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:04,970
 Tonight's after party was so successful that it sold out a week in advance. 

58
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,400
 The photo booth in the main exhibition at the pop-up store 

59
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,670
 is already all over social media 

60
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,540
 and is at the center of the public's attention. 

61
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:19,780
 The visitors said it really felt like they were underwater. 

62
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:25,640
 They praised the theme that suits the vegan branding for the new product line. 

63
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:28,090
 On this week's "Reporters on the Way," XU Beauty's new product... 

64
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,510
Get the rabbit in the picture too! The rabbit too!

65
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:31,670
- Okay. 
 - Wow!

66
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:34,250
Let's do a Boomerang video.

67
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,000
Hey, hey.

68
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,420
What? My gosh.

69
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,870
Let's take a photo. Let's take a photo.

70
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:47,090
- Let's go over there. Hurry, hurry. 
 - Hey!

71
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,370
Hey, Yu Mi!

72
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,120
Take a photo with me too.

73
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,370
I'm sorry, but my feed has an age limit.

74
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,870
Come on. You're making me sad!

75
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,740
I know everything about you.

76
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:27,890
Pardon?

77
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:32,530
My Yu Mi likes Jeong Woo.

78
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:38,540
And Jeong Woo likes Kang Na Eon.

79
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:45,670
The three fellow colleagues are shooting the Animal Kingdom documentary.

80
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:49,990
Stop f***ing around.

81
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,830
Why, what's wrong?

82
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,010
Hey, Mr. Popular.

83
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,310
Excuse me.

84
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:08,840
Rumors say you slept with Do Yu Mi. Is that true?

85
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,300
- What are you trying to do? 
 - Why?

86
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,980
You couldn't do that because your heart belongs to Kang Na Eon, huh?

87
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:19,240
- That's enough. 
 - I hate to tell you this,

88
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:23,320
but I think Kang Na Eon and that intern are hitting it off.

89
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,760
♫  It's over, baby  ♫

90
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:44,070
♫  It's over, baby  ♫

91
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,620
♫  O-O-Over  ♫

92
00:08:51,430 --> 00:08:53,820
♫  It's over, baby  ♫

93
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,660
♫  It's over, baby  ♫

94
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:02,930
Whoa, Team Leader!

95
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,370
Team Leader! Team Leader!

96
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:09,350
What are you doing here? I looked for you everywhere.

97
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:11,930
Let's have a drink. Come on. Let's drink.

98
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,400
Let's go, let's go.

99
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:42,030
I didn't think you'd come.

100
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:44,740
The interns are required to come.

101
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,090
It's not because I don't like you.

102
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:01,470
That's just how this industry is,

103
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:05,010
so you'd better accept it.

104
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,270
I don't like you, Sunbae.

105
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:14,210
They say fans who turn into haters are the scariest kind.

106
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:20,770
I'll keep what you told me in mind.

107
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,090
You said you can even sell your soul.

108
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:30,070
I'll bet my soul, too.

109
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,880
So...

110
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,570
hire me full-time.

111
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,570
So I can fight you properly.

112
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,890
No.

113
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:05,900
You're fired.

114
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,880
I did it just in case, but I'm glad I backed them up.

115
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:14,630
I heard you dispose of everything once it becomes useless.

116
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,330
So?

117
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,870
What is it...

118
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,590
that you want?

119
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,690
You.

120
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,290
   

121
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:04,200
   

122
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,180
   

123
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:16,300
   

124
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:19,480
   

125
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,210
   

126
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:02,040
- Yes? 
  - This is Reporter Seong Il Hyeon of Donghwa Daily. 

127
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,470
 This is Ms. Kang Na Eon, correct? 

128
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:17,310
 XU Beauty's new product line that created a buzz with cruelty-free marketing turned out to be fraudulent. 

129
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:23,440
 It was confirmed that XU Beauty has been testing on animals on a large scale at its factory. 

130
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,560
 Police have initiated an investigation 

131
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,340
  into XU Beauty's suspected use of animal-based ingredients. 

132
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,260
 Meanwhile, criticism toward XU Beauty intensifies. 

133
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,940
Why did you insist on marketing it as a vegan brand?

134
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,360
Was everything a lie?

135
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,940
Don't just walk by. Say something.

136
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:49,580
We just did what Team Leader Kang told us to do.

137
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:53,040
   

138
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,820
   

139
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,590
   

140
00:15:38,590 --> 00:15:41,060
It's not even about disciplining me.

141
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,660
Having a board meeting means you want me to leave, right?

142
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,710
Don't take it too personally.

143
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:50,850
We're barely managing to stop the consumer organization from filing a lawsuit.

144
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:55,210
We can't let a subsidiary company cause harm to the umbrella company.

145
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,520
We haven't determined if it's true or not—

146
00:15:56,520 --> 00:16:00,020
The truth is right in front of us. What is there to determine?

147
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:18,900
You've been having an intimate relationship with the CEO of XU Beauty.

148
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:21,650
I think that's the truth.

149
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,060
You've worked hard all this time.

150
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,730
Let us meet Team Leader Kang! 
    

151
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,170
Where is she right now?

152
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,480
I said,  we don't know either.

153
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,350
There's no point in doing this here.

154
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,630
Please!

155
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:07,060
- Please tell us if it's true. 
 - Don't push!

156
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,470
Stop doing this here. Please leave!

157
00:17:14,730 --> 00:17:17,640
Team Leader. Team Leader, take a look at this.

158
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,820
What is this, a public execution? 
    

159
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,960
Did they have to put up a huge sign like this?

160
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,870
I wasn't even hired full-time yet, but it's already a disaster.

161
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,700
By the way, where's Eun Ho Oppa?

162
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,980
Not sure.

163
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,700
Rumors said he and Team Leader Kang were an item. Did he get fired, too?

164
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,370
What?

165
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,510
I'm sorry.

166
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,370
I'm sorry.

167
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,880
People might take you seriously.

168
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,970
Was it all a lie, then?

169
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,520
Who was it, anyway?

170
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,720
   

171
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,950
I got rid of all the videos So Eun Ho had.

172
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:33,730
But then who...

173
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:36,660
 I did it just in case, 

174
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,250
 but I'm glad I backed them up. 

175
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:52,210
   

176
00:23:42,550 --> 00:23:44,340
 Why did you do that? 

177
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,030
 Why did you do that? 

178
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,430
 Why did you do that? Why did you do that? 

179
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,900
 - Why did you do that? 
 - Why did you do that? 

180
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,750
 - Why? 
 - Why did you do that? 

181
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,170
 Why did you do that? 

182
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:56,530
 - Why did you do that to me? 
 - Why did you do that? 

183
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:00,280
 Why? Why did you do that to me? 

184
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:06,950


185
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,840
 I'm glad I backed them up. 

186
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,610
 So? 

187
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:25,790
 What is it that you want? 

188
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,510
 You. 

189
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,610
 I want everything including... 

190
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,470
 your soul. 

191
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:02,730
♫  Just call me my name, I don't ask for much  ♫

192
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:08,090
♫  Don't tell me your rules, I don't really care   ♫

193
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:12,340
♫  Now I'll beat my personal best, I've far surpassed it  ♫

194
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:17,530
♫  And I'll shine even brighter tomorrow, that's my dream  ♫

195
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:26,670
♫  Just call me my name, don't tell me your rules  ♫

196
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:42,940
♫  Just call me my name, don't tell me your rules  ♫

197
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,460
    
 ♫  If you know you're bad  ♫

198
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,620
♫  How could I not love you?  ♫

199
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:55,140
♫  Like in a dream  ♫

200
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,850
♫  I'm afraid to forget everything  ♫

201
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,360
♫  Even if I cover my eyes, even if I try to shake it off  ♫

202
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:09,130
♫  It's you I know, fill me up  ♫

203
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:15,860
♫  You're sweet and sour, I'm drunk off you, Bae  ♫

204
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:24,470
♫  I'm getting greedier, I step toward you, on your mind  ♫

205
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:31,620
♫  Mm, a little closer, I let you feel me  ♫

206
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,110
♫  We're intricately blended  ♫
