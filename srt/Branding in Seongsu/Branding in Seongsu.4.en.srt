76
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,609

95

I know you like Jung Woo.

100
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:32,089
But Jung Woo...

101
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,599
likes Na Eon.

102
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,000
The three of you joined the company together.

103
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:42,639

109
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,089

What?

112
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,069
Can you not do such a thing...

113
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,729
because you have feelings for Kang Na Eon?

114
00:08:15,099 --> 00:08:16,870
- That's enough, okay? - What are you going to do?

115
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:20,539

- Let's go. - Have a drink with us.

121
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,759
- Yes, come on. - Let's go!

122
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:39,719
I didn't think you'd come.

123
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,119
As an intern, I had no choice.

124
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,070
I didn't do it because I hate you.

125
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,800
It's just how this industry works.

126
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:01,969
So just accept it.

127
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:04,609

129
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:11,550
nothing scarier than having an anti-fan who used to be your fan.

130
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,020

131
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,089
I'll never forget them.

132
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:23,359

133
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,070
I'll bet my soul too.

134
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,369
So please,

135
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,839
give me a permanent position in the company...

136
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,709
so I can...

137
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:37,780

You're fired.

140
00:11:53,589 --> 00:11:54,950

141
00:11:55,759 --> 00:11:57,290
and I'm glad I did.

142
00:12:07,469 --> 00:12:09,070

143
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,940
you deemed useless.

144

So you won't look into whether it's true...

186

Look into what? The truth is right before our eyes.

187
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:16,420
You've been having your secret rendezvous with XU's CEO.

What is this, a public execution?

202
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:21,450
Did they really have to announce it like that on that huge screen?

203
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,218
We have to deal with this before our internship is over?

204
00:17:28,219 --> 00:17:30,459
By the way, where is Eun Ho?

205
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:31,989
I wonder too.

206
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:35,130
There were rumors about him dating Ms. Kang.

207
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:36,759
Did he get fired too?

208
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:37,930
What?

209
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:42,430

So, who did this?

218
00:18:32,690 --> 00:18:34,049
I'd made a backup just in case,
