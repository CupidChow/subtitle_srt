1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:07,180
   

2
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,540
Sunbae!

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,640
Are you okay, Sunbae?

4
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:20,990
Lean on me.

5
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:23,250
Turn the lights on right now!

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,740
Sunbae.

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,770
Na Eon!

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,470
You can't turn all the lights off all of a sudden.

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,330
Na Eon, did you fall because it was dark?

10
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,170
Should we go to the hospital?

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,840
I'm okay, so get out.

12
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,610
I'm tired.

13
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:45,380
Okay.

14
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,060
Get some rest.

15
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,300
Why don't you get lost along with me?

16
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:54,570
So Eun Ho should stay.

17
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,750
Are you okay, Sunbae?

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:05,660
Aren't you going to leave?

19
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:14,890
Sunbae.

20
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:21,750
How did you know?

21
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,350
I told you I saw the ghost when I was in your body.

22
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,070
When did this start?

23
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:30,980
It's none of your business.

24
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll leave then.

25
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,050
Stay for a moment.

26
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:57,910


27
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,490
If I look okay,

28
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,480
then you can leave.

29
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:41,020
♫  If you understand me when I hesitate, you are my all  ♫

30
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,440
   

31
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,340
   

32
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,140
   

33
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,500
   

34
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,860
   

35
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:12,070
   

36
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:16,080
   

37
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,160
Daebak.

38
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,830
Team Leader Kang is returning to Team 1. 
     

39
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,380
It's because Segye Soju's pop-up was a hit.

40
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,110
Daebak. So cool.

41
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,890
   

42
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,000
   

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,550
   

44
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,010
   

45
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:44,020
   

46
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:50,200
She's here. She's here.

47
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,250
   

48
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,140
She's so cool.

49
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,150
   

50
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,270
   

51
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,270
Congratulations on returning.

52
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:35,570
I just came back to where I was before.

53
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,060
What will you do with the Underdog Team?

54
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:48,540
We each belong in our rightful positions.

55
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,120
 Ta-da! 

56
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:05,950
There you are, Team Leader Kang.

57
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,870
I heard Team 1's office is by huge windows.

58
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,100
So, I brought some sunglasses.

59
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,760
Gosh, you're blindingly bright already.

60
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,260
What are you doing right now?

61
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,350
Is it because it's not so pretty?

62
00:05:17,350 --> 00:05:20,930
As a rule, the team members go where the team leader goes.

63
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,840
That's why we also packed our things.

64
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,900
You're so full of hope.

65
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,860
W-What do you mean?

66
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,650
Get it together and...

67
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:44,140
guard the basement storage properly.

68
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,900
The Underdog Team won't be joining Team 1 just because of a few good ideas.

69
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,540
You didn't think the company would be that easy, right?

70
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,450
How could you be so cruel, Team Leader Kang?

71
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,650
Think about the time we spent together.

72
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,500
I know. She was pretending to be all friendly.

73
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:06,200
Good thing you packed everything. Bring them to my office later.

74
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,430
M-Me?

75
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,360
You plotted this with So Eun Ho, right?

76
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,170
Didn't you?

77
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,200
Yu Mi, good luck...

78
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,180
in the Underdog Team...

79
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,820
you've been looking down on.

80
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:31,380
Sunbae, why didn't you wake me up—

81
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,950
Huh? You're ignoring me now?

82
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,210
Sunbae?

83
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:39,670
What are you doing here?

84
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,350
Son of a bitch.

85
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:45,150
Oh, I didn't report Actor Nam's drug use.

86
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,380
Well, the one who just went up did.

87
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,780
It doesn't make sense, right? I'm sorry.

88
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:56,130
 Please come to the company meeting. 

89
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,370
Gosh, hell's gate is opening. What do we do?

90
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:01,940
What the hell?

91
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,930
You're still clueless, aren't you?

92
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,630
Don't come over.

93
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:19,930
You initiated this company meeting.

94
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,500
I'm saying it doesn't concern you.

95
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,310
Gosh, seriously. Geez.

96
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,760
I'll sit over there then.

97
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,930
While I was briefly gone,

98
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:46,470
not a single team progressed properly on their projects except for the Underdog Team.

99
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,020
But I'm not complimenting the Underdog Team.

100
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,780
You'd better brace yourselves.

101
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,220
You can't go home starting today.

102
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,570
Rebranding for the new cafe on Yeonmujang-ro.

103
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,670
 Pick us. Pick us. 

104
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:08,640
We want it.

105
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,960
Team 3.

106
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:17,150
A domestic fashion brand's pop-up at the Seongwon Department Store.

107
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,800
 - Us, us!  
 - Sunbae, Sunbae!

108
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,830
Team 4.

109
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,290
What if she gives us another weird project?

110
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:29,760
No way...

111
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,800
   

112
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,320
Inbyeol Entertainment.

113
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,890
Inbyeol Entertainment?

114
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,720
Hey, Jenny. Calm down. They're gangsters, apparently.

115
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,800
Gosh, no way. Hide.

116
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,910
The Inbyeol Entertainment project goes to...

117
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,880
- Team 2. 
 - Why are you giving us that crap?

118
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:00,530
HQ Motors.

119
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:02,260
Eun Ho, let's do that one.

120
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:06,330
We need to work on a corporate project to join Team 1.

121
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:08,340
- Over here! 
 -  Choose us! Choose us! 

122
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,940
Over here.

123
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,410
Here.

124
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:13,880
The HQ Motors project...

125
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,880
will be mine.

126
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,650
How about us, then?

127
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,500
   

128
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:29,270
Daeseongjang?

129
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,880
Motel Daeseongjang?

130
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,120
They went out of business.

131
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,720
It's in the back alley at the intersection on the way here.

132
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,990
- Seriously. 
 - What the hell?

133
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:42,270
I want to work with a proper brand for once.

134
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,590
I'm sure the Team Leader has a plan—

135
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:46,830
- I don't. 
 - She doesn't.

136
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,760
She said she doesn't.

137
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,090
Why are you doing this to us?

138
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:54,080
The Underdog Team exists because...

139
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,360
they can work on challenging projects.

140
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:01,850
Good luck, everyone.

141
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:06,580
How could she change so much?

142
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:09,610
How could she?

143
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,550
Don't cry.

144
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:13,120
   

145
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,720
As soon as Team Leader Kang returned...

146
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,240
Gosh, I'm scared.

147
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:22,000
- What was that? 
 - Why? What? What?

148
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:26,060
You're creating a new record as a newbie.

149
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,210
You're doing branding for a motel now.

150
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:32,330
What's wrong with doing branding for a motel?

151
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,200
I saw Daeseongjang on the way to work.

152
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:43,060
 It's basically falling apart since it's over 50 years old. 

153
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,690
 It must be haunted. 

154
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:46,020
 How could this exist in Seongsu? 

155
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,500
No matter how hip Seongsu is, I'd never go near there.

156
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,590
It's so creepy.

157
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,100
I heard from the seniors.

158
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,830
 I'm scared. 

159
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:57,260
 It's a famous spot for having affairs. 

160
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,510
 They're going in! Don't go in! Don't go in! 

161
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,190
Thank you for the helpful information.

162
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,280
   

163
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,810
- What else? 
 - Wow, you really don't get how serious this is...

164
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:11,510
Affairs aren't the only issue.

165
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,930
 - School uniforms. 
 - Aren't they minors? 

166
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,700
 They even accept minors. 

167
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,490
 Hey, guys! 

168
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,020
 - Don't do that.  
 -What?

169
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,810
They accept minors?

170
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:24,960
Hey, where are you going?

171
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,530
- I should teach them a lesson! 
  - No, no, no! 

172
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,230
- We should report them! 
  - Sit down! 

173
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:33,550
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What was that?

174
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:36,980
By the way, Team Leader Kang sure is intimidating.

175
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,540
She acted like a member of the Underdog Team when she was there.

176
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:45,660
She gave something like the Daeseongjang project to the Underdogs as soon as she became Team 1's leader again.

177
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,170
She's trying to draw the line.

178
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,570
   

179
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:08,030
   

180
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:16,140
   

181
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:21,140
 Yes, this is HQ Motors— 

182
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,640
This is Kang Na Eon of Seongsu Agency.

183
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,530
I'll be working with HQ Motors starting today.

184
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:31,950
 We spoke directly to Director Han Yi Jae of Segye Group and made an agreement— 

185
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:34,440
Is there a reason I can't be in charge of the project?

186
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,540
 No, it's not that, but... 

187
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,200
I'll see you at the meeting then.

188
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,920
 Okay, then... 

189
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:54,340
 Director Han stole the project given to Seongsu Agency? 

190
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,230
   

191
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,710
Is this the hottest motel for cheaters...

192
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,340
Call Team Leader Do right now.

193
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,870
Why isn't she coming?

194
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,650
Try calling her. 
    

195
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:17,750
 The customer is not answering the phone. You'll be connected to the voicemail... 

196
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:18,920
 - after the beep.  
 - What?

197
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,320
She's not answering.

198
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,790
Gosh, seriously.

199
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:24,400
Huh?

200
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,520
 Don't contact me. 

201
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,310
Gosh, my gosh. This world's gone crazy.

202
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,980
- I can't believe it. 
 - Okay, okay.

203
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,910
She might be helping us by not coming.

204
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:37,170
- Okay. Fighting. Fighting! 
 - Fighting.

205
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:40,170
Team Leader Kang is gone too. Can we do this?

206
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,210
You have me, the handsome guy.

207
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,560
Gosh, your confidence is off the charts.

208
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,280
Gosh. Why am I so annoyed?

209
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,380
Shall we go in, then? 
    

210
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,770
Grandma, I'll be home late.

211
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,900
By chance...

212
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,240
Seongsu Agency?

213
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,280
Yes. That's correct.

214
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,840
Gosh, this is so annoying.

215
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,050
Why don't they just sell it?

216
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,550
We won't do the rebranding.

217
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:19,650
So just go on your way.

218
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,880
Gosh, young lady.

219
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,020
Looks like you don't know.

220
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:28,050
The handmade shoe factory event,

221
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:29,990
Girlish pop-up,

222
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:33,670
and the Mood party that happened last weekend

223
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:37,110
were all done by us.

224
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,740
Unni, Unni, Unni.

225
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,060
Daeseongjang will be a hit if you work with us. I'm not kidding.

226
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:49,290
Right, Team Leader So?

227
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,740
Me?

228
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,220
 Just say you're the team leader. 

229
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:02,220
Yes, so if we rebrand your motel,

230
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,820
Daeseongjang will have a chance to be reborn.

231
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,850
Didn't ask.

232
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,200
- I don't care. 
 - Reborn...

233
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,250
Hey.

234
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,550
We need to check it out since we were commissioned.

235
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,640
We don't care if you're annoyed. Whatever TV.  (Short for "Whatever, go watch TV.") 

236
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:39,260
I don't care if you check it out or not. Whatever refrigerator.  (Word play meant to annoy each other) 

237
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,990
Whatever, secret princess limited edition.

238
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:48,490
- Whatever— 
 - Whatever, cordless vacuum cleaner, two for one.

239
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:50,410
Comes with an electric shaver.

240
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:53,270
- Huh— 
 - Huh? Never mind.

241
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,270
You pissed? You angry?

242
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,590
But you can't do anything.

243
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,250
Cucuru-bbing-bbong-bbing-bbong-bbang.

244
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,650
- Bbbang-bbing-bbong. 
 - Bbong-bbong-bbang.

245
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,270
Bbing-bbing.

246
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,620
I need to go to a pool party. You're ruining my vibe.

247
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,020
What will you do with this worn-out motel?

248
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:22,280
Our superstar, Jenny.

249
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,410
She can be useful sometimes.

250
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,240
You saw it, right?

251
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,380
By the way, why is it so scary?

252
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,690
Forget the cheaters. Not even ghosts will come.

253
00:16:41,690 --> 00:16:44,150
Do you want to go first, Oppa?

254
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,190
Who? Me?

255
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:48,460
Yes, lead the way, Honey. Yeah, yeah...

256
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,930
Gosh, it smells.

257
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:57,120
A hundred bottles of room fresheners won't remove this smell.

258
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,150
- Okay, okay. 
 - What's wrong?

259
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:00,390
It's too dark.

260
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,600
So scary...

261
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,290
Let's hurry up. I'm so scared.

262
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,000
- I'm so scared! What? What? What? 
 - What? What?

263
00:17:20,990 --> 00:17:22,090
The clock.

264
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:23,590
The clock.

265
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:27,310
I'm too scared to be in the back. I can't do it. Seriously.

266
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:36,790
The mouth! It's way too big.

267
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,610
It's too big. Seriously.

268
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:49,620
There are so many wanted posters.

269
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,030
Are there this many criminals?

270
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:54,020
- You go first, Jenny. 
 - No-o-o!

271
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,600
I'll quit my job.

272
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,420
I'll submit the resignation letter. I'm serious!

273
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,980
A bicycle? Shit.

274
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:06,160
I hate this!

275
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:11,070
The... The door is open here.

276
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,170
Why is that the only opened one?

277
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:18,610
But we need to check out the room.

278
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,610
- No. 
 - Yes.

279
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:24,600
Darn it!

280
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,830
 What? What? What? What? What? 

281
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,280
Cockroach! Cockroach!

282
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,930
The cockroach is scared of you.

283
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:56,120
It's nothing to be scared of...

284
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,070
We're so sorry...

285
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,440
So, you're saying...

286
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:20,880
you commissioned us because you wanted to change the motel?

287
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,750
I did commission you,

288
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,220
but I don't want to change it.

289
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:34,100
Gosh, Unni. What are you talking about?

290
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:37,760
We'll change it completely. In Rex style.

291
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,480
I said I don't want to change it.

292
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:45,160
Ma'am, since you commissioned us, we need—

293
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,550
Don't change it, I said!

294
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,040
Get out!

295
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:51,770
Get out right now!

296
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:02,090
We're not so happy about the person in charge

297
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,350
suddenly changing.

298
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,520
You commissioned Seongsu Agency first.

299
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,060
We did, but—

300
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,400
Seongsu Agency and Segye Group are the same company.

301
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,280
You should distribute duties within the group—

302
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,090
I...

303
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,940
really want to work on this project.

304
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:26,280
I need to do it.

305
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,040
Seriously, how ridiculous.

306
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,870
We were commissioned, but they don't want us to do anything.

307
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,450
- And they kicked us out. 
 - Right?

308
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,790
Unni, did you see her suddenly changing?

309
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:43,480
I thought she was Team Leader Kang. With a completely different expression,

310
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:46,120
she said, "Underdogs should stay underdogs.

311
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,380
Get out. Get out right now!"

312
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,290
Gosh, I hate it.

313
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,280
What do we do now?

314
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:58,220
   

315
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,960
I'll try talking to her again.

316
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,520
What will you tell her?

317
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,170
   

318
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,490
Team Leader Kang, you're still just as stubborn.

319
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:45,910
I heard you changed a bit recently.

320
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:48,990
I'm back to normal.

321
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:10,900
Team Leader?

322
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,720
- Team Leader. 
 - Are you okay, Team Leader?

323
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,040
Honey!

324
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,160
Honey, are you okay?

325
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,020
Honey?

326
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:19,180
What's wrong, Honey?

327
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:23,480
I thought you were captured by the ghost lady since you didn't come out.

328
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,130
I was worried.

329
00:23:25,130 --> 00:23:26,530
Ghost lady?

330
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,040
Yes.

331
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:31,500
 What? No way— 

332
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,740
Shit, again?

333
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,260
Again?

334
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,660
What? What do you mean?

335
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:42,100
Honey, w-what's wrong?

336
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,160
Why is this happening so randomly?

337
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,840
Honey, are you okay?

338
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,000
Why don't we call it a night?

339
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,330
But nothing has been resolved.

340
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:58,120
Go home, I said.

341
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:02,060
You said you'd try something. Why get angry? Why?

342
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,190
Unni, let's go home for now. Yes, yes.

343
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:07,010
What am I supposed to do exactly? Let go.

344
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:09,020
- Let's go. Let's go. 
 - But Eun Ho—

345
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,280
Go home, I said.

346
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:27,360
 I'll assume you accepted the deal, then. I'll look forward to it. 
   

347
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,160
 Director Han? 

348
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:38,070
 I'll tell you what you want to know under one condition. 

349
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:46,380
So Eun Ho wants something from Director Han?

350
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,690
Where am I...

351
00:25:02,690 --> 00:25:07,080
You're at HQ Motors.

352
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,000
A-Are you okay?

353
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,360
Motors?

354
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,110
What's your condition?

355
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,660
I thought it wouldn't be fun just to tell you.

356
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,290
 The HQ Motors project 

357
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:23,740
Kang Na Eon is trying to get.

358
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,830
Make it fall through. That's my condition.

359
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,080
Team Leader, you don't seem well today. Go home and rest first—

360
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,820
No.

361
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,670
I'll give up...

362
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,510
on this project.

363
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,340
 How about bypassing Kang Na Eon and 

364
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:01,380
 become the youngest team leader? 

365
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,310
 I can tell just from your eyes 

366
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:12,720
 that you're filled with deep-seated desire. 

367
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,390
 Don't worry. I'll give you the ammunition. 

368
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:23,370
 Something that will bring Kang Na Eon down. 

369
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:25,710
 Everything about... 

370
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:28,520
 Kang Na Eon. 

371
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:35,510
 What if I want something else? 

372
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,400
 The truth. 

373
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:46,750
 The truth of... 

374
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:49,910
 that day five years ago. 

375
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:57,010
   

376
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:32,750


377
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:38,580
♫  Walk steadily just like as Rocky  ♫

378
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:43,130
♫  The windy road doesn't affect me at all  ♫
