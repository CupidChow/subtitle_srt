1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,010
   

2
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,160
   

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,600
   

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,820
So tall.

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:25,940


6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,290
Let's go.

7
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,350
- Hello. 
 - Hello, how can I help you?

8
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,760
There's an amazing brand we designed.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,760
I wanted to collaborate with Segye Group.

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,760
Did you register as a visitor?

11
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,120
In my heart, I did.

12
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:49,000
Next person, please.

13
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,910
I'm going to the 13th floor.

14
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:55,150
   

15
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:57,160
Seventh floor?

16
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:21,500
Are you an employee here?

17
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,830
I might be soon.

18
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,360
You can't go in unless you're an employee.

19
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:34,370
Come on. Come on.

20
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:36,830
I'll just give this to the marketing team.

21
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:39,240
I just need a moment.

22
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,460
You can't.

23
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,820
What's that?

24
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,910
Over there! Over there!

25
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:55,100
I said I just need a moment.

26
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:57,780
I'll just deliver it quickly.

27
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,450
Unni!

28
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:13,800
Gosh, what do we do? Today's an important day.

29
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,620
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,780
I'm sorry.

31
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,470
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,290
Be careful. That looks important.

33
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,520
Are you okay?

34
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:39,230
Wait, excuse me...

35
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,670
Wait... um...

36
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,610
I'm going. I'm going

37
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,700
O-Okay.

38
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,500
   

39
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,300
Kang Na Eon?

40
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,650
   

41
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:25,520
   

42
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,250
   

43
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,550
   

44
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,870
   

45
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:48,120
   

46
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:52,460
Gosh, I'm so nervous. My heart is racing.

47
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:57,530
Only the presenter may enter.

48
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,200
How about her bestie?

49
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,520
- You can't. 
 - How about her best bestie?

50
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,710
You can't.

51
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,620
It's okay. I'll be right back.

52
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,660
Okay. Good luck.

53
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,140
Fighting.

54
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:11,230
Hello.

55
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:17,770
Director Min, you must not have had anyone to mentor

56
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:21,560
since you chose a third-year employee. Not to mention, it's a girl.

57
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:26,330
What poor judgment you must have that

58
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:29,270
you judge based on how many years they've worked and their sex.

59
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,220
I think your judgment is poorer.

60
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,780
Here comes the director.

61
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,900
What's with your faces?

62
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,580
Is my hairstyle too cute?

63
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:02,570
You're pretty, no matter what hairstyle you have.

64
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:06,820
Seriously, you do have good taste, Director Han.

65
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,910
What?

66
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,130
Is she Min Hee Jeong's kid?

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,550
- Excuse me. 
 - Yes.

68
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:24,820
Stop delaying and start the presentation.

69
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,600
Okay.

70
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:31,740
By the way, don't you have printouts for the presentation?

71
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:48,330
I didn't prepare...

72
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,760
printouts on purpose.

73
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:56,830
I'd appreciate it if you focused on me during the presentation.

74
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:02,100
I'll send a summary file to each department after the presentation.

75
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:10,320
I'll start the presentation on Segye International's in-house scented candle brand.

76
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,310
No, it's okay.

77
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,560
Our proposal was way too cool for the Segye Group to handle.

78
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,370
 Don't overdo it. 

79
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,630
 I like things the way they are now. 

80
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:30,410
 Da Eun, I'll make sure Bandi becomes an international brand. 

81
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:34,490
Your proposal is amazing for both consumers and distributors.

82
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,260
And I think it's good for the world, too—

83
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,760
Huh? 
    

84
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,720
Hold on, Da Eun.

85
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:49,490
   

86
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,160
Let me get off! Sir!

87
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,280
Sir, let me get off!

88
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,640
Wait a minute.

89
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,690
It's been perfect so far.

90
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,470
The signature scents of our own that you're talking about.

91
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:19,300
Where will we get them, exactly?

92
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:25,620
Well, if this proposal is approved, I'll—

93
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:28,270
No, no, no, no, no.

94
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,730
You'll only pass if you've prepared all of it.

95
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,900
Anyone can talk, don't you think?

96
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,820
I'll give you a week.

97
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,130
Pardon?

98
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:46,280
Find an exclusive scent for Charmant Candle by the next board meeting.

99
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,940
I love this idea.

100
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,510
 Anyway, see you next week. 

101
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,160
Is this the exit, or is that it?

102
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,870
Catch him!

103
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,780
Young man!

104
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,160
Stop right there!

105
00:08:45,770 --> 00:08:48,040
I actually have a reason this time.

106
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,490
I don't believe you, young man.

107
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:53,680
I'm serious.

108
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,310
Please!

109
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:58,600
Well done.

110
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:01,000
That probably wasn't the presentation you prepared though.

111
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,110
What do you mean? Did something happen?

112
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,150
- Was it obvious? 
 - Very much.

113
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:08,240
There was a small accident earlier on the first floor.

114
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,300
It wasn't bad considering that.

115
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:14,100
But there's something that hasn't been decided yet, correct?

116
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:18,140
It should be resolved before the next board meeting.

117
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,610
You sound like Min Hee Jeong's kid.

118
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:27,000
Make sure it goes well.

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,130
You need to have what the other person needs in order

120
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:33,360
to get what you want.

121
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,770
If you pull this project off,

122
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:40,450
I think you'll become the team leader you wanted to be.

123
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:44,420
Daebak. Then won't she become the youngest team leader?

124
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:45,980
Good luck!

125
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,610
Thank you.

126
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,240
Come on.

127
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:58,740
- Come here. 
 - Geez.

128
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:01,250
Ms. Kang Na Eon!

129
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,140
What?

130
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,860
I-It's nothing.

131
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,590
Seriously, congratulations.

132
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,930
 

133
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:17,280
   

134
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,520
   

135
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,110
How can I do this alone?

136
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:26,120
No, I need to do it.

137
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,070
I need to. I need to.

138
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,940
Okay.

139
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,180
   

140
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,880
   

141
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,970
   

142
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,190
   

143
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,760
There's a bug! I'm scared, Jeong Woo!

144
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,300
You scare me the most.

145
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,020
Wait for me!

146
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,850
Hurry up.

147
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,660
By the way... 
    

148
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:04,400
By the way, why did you guys follow me?

149
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,850
I didn't follow you. I drove you.

150
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:09,330
What would you have done without me?

151
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,260
I didn't follow you. I'm accompanying you.

152
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,060
It's awkward if you two are alone together.

153
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,570
So what would you have done without me?

154
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,260
Thank you.

155
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,350
   

156
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,340
Wow, it smells incredible.

157
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,760
Na Eon, how did you find this place?

158
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,300
By chance.

159
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,480
If you can make a candle with this scent,

160
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,570
you could sell it to luxury hotels, too.

161
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,200
Yes.

162
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,130
Please sketch the packaging.

163
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:56,700
Make it as luxurious as possible.

164
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:03,100
Who are you over there?

165
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:09,360
By chance, are you from Segye Group?

166
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,910
As I already told you on the phone—

167
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:16,440
Sir, we wanted to have a more in-depth conversation in person.

168
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,770
 Make sure it goes well. 

169
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,790
 You need to have what the other person needs 

170
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,240
 in order to get what you want. 

171
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,750
I already said no many times.

172
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:45,390
We're not interested in commercializing the natural scent created by using traditional methods—

173
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,320
I heard you inherited the skill to create a natural scent and became

174
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,570
a perfume master for the sake of your son's health.

175
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:57,210
And I know he's still quite ill too.

176
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:59,070
That's very personal for us.

177
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,890
Yes, it's personal.

178
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:04,050
A situation you are very worried about.

179
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,920
I wish I could give you more time.

180
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,140
I'll give you two days.

181
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,810
I'm very desperate, too.

182
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:23,290
Here she comes. Here she comes.

183
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:30,840
He's old enough to be your grandfather. Didn't you go too far?

184
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,460
He probably doesn't want to work with us for sure now.

185
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,500
No.

186
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,860
I'm sure he'll want to work with us now.

187
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,500
What?

188
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:43,020
You need to have what the other person wants

189
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,740
in order to get what you want.

190
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,040
Hey.

191
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,850
Hey, Na Eon.

192
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:03,010
   

193
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:09,500
So this is where the master lives, huh?

194
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:14,610
   

195
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,370
Excuse me.

196
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,410
Dong Hyeon.

197
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,650
What are you all doing?

198
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,200
Huh? What?

199
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:35,850
 Segye Group's new brand, Charmant, has been creating a lot of buzz. 

200
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:39,780
 Charmant's signature scent was created by Master Ji Hyeon Joong, 

201
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:44,160
 who has continued the perfume manufacturing method used in the Joseon era. 

202
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,490
 Charmant Candle is being received well in exhibitions around the world. 

203
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:52,180
 Segye Group is now preparing to enter the international market. 

204
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,510
This is a real masterpiece.

205
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:57,250
It's true, but...

206
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:01,520
the fact that we're relying on one master is a bit risky—

207
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:07,590
We'll simultaneously launch this campaign and work on a project that discovers the forgotten perfume masters.

208
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:13,160
Each master's technique will create their own signature scent.

209
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,270
Exactly.

210
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:19,560
Director Han can be too negative sometimes.

211
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:24,390
Even the top luxury hotels want to use our candle.

212
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:25,800
I'm sorry.

213
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,780
So, is there anything you want Min Hee Jeong's kid?

214
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:36,050
Yes, tell us what you really want.

215
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,210
   

216
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:58,310
Charmant Candle, explain your similarity to Bandi Candle!

217
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:03,430
Charmant Candle, explain your similarity to Bandi Candle!

218
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,260
Charmant Candle, explain—

219
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,420
I told you to leave!

220
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,780
Let me meet with Kang Na Eon I said!

221
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,070
Gosh, seriously.

222
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,380
How could you people do this?

223
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,930
Why are you asking us that?

224
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:19,790
That's why I'm asking you to let me meet Kang Na Eon!

225
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:22,550
I said you can't!

226
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:25,730
We'll call the police if you come back again.

227
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,460
Let's go.

228
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,950
Are you serious? Catch him!

229
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,780
   

230
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,570
 Is this Ms. Kang Na Eon? 

231
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:15,250
Who's this?

232
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,730
You know about Bandi Candle, right?

233
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,310
I've never heard of them.

234
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,700
How could you not know?

235
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,740
I know you people stole our concept.

236
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,110
Do you have any evidence?

237
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,300
What?

238
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:29,380
I'll give you a week.

239
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,470
I'll acknowledge it if you bring evidence within a week.

240
00:18:34,470 --> 00:18:36,590
H-Hello...

241
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,820
What makes you think there isn't?

242
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,060
Just wait and see.

243
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,090
No, no...

244
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:10,680
   

245
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:17,030
Eun Ho.

246
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:21,740
Eun Ho!

247
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,260
   

248
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:31,200
I apologize.

249
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,550
I'll remove myself from this project.

250
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:34,150
Hey!

251
00:20:35,130 --> 00:20:38,470
Branding for HQ Motors' liquid hydrogen battery technology.

252
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,860
We'll compete with our presentations.

253
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,980
I'll see you at the next presentation.

254
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,920
Follow me.

255
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,050
Let go, I said!

256
00:20:51,790 --> 00:20:54,520
- Do you want to die? 
 - Go ahead. It's your body.

257
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,330
Hey, you. Do you think things were different for me?

258
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,710
I was the same then—

259
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,770
After that happened to Bandi Candle,

260
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:04,630
Segye Group's marketing team was shut down, right?

261
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,130
I thought you'd lose a lot because of that.

262
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,170
But you got back up quickly.

263
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:14,080
I was curious how you felt

264
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,300
while moving up the ladder so tenaciously

265
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:20,090
and if you had an ounce of guilt in you.

266
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,840
But...

267
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,890
you didn't even remember me.

268
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,570
As if nothing had happened.

269
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:30,980
That's why I came all the way here.

270
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,460
To make you remember me.

271
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,270
So?

272
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,070
Will you ruin my life using my body?

273
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,780
Yes.

274
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,840
How dare you.

275
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,450
Of course, I dare to.

276
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:48,020
While you're at it, admit that you switched our souls.

277
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:50,640
Maybe I did.

278
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,210
What?

279
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:57,970
I prayed every day that I would become Kang Na Eon so I could ruin you.

280
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,480
 I prayed that I'd become Kang Na Eon 

281
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,570
 so I could expose what you did to the world. 

282
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:14,990
 And I wanted you to become me and hurt a hundred times... no... 

283
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:17,820
 a thousand times more than I did. 

284
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:22,350
 I prayed that countless times, day and night. 

285
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:27,090
 Maybe my prayer was heard... 

286
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:29,670
since I wanted it so desperately.

287
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,820
What kind of nonsense is this...

288
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:38,620
Does it make sense that you took what we worked on for years overnight?

289
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,180
Put it back.

290
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,610
Put everything back to the way it was.

291
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:49,600
I don't know what I'm supposed to do either.

292
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:56,170
The bodies switch back only when the lead character reforms himself.

293
00:22:56,170 --> 00:23:01,900
But our lead character is too evil. So I'm not sure.

294
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,770
You bastard.

295
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,570
What are you doing?

296
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:09,660
Shit.

297
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,660
Isn't this the only way to that we know of to switch back to ourselves?

298
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,020
Don't push it.

299
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,520
You're the absolute worst.

300
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:28,460


301
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:32,240
♫  Can you see it from afar?  ♫

302
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,270
