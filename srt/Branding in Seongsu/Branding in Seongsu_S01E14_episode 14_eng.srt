1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,420
   

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:11,840
Hello, I'm Actor Nam Yun Hyeok.

3
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:17,910
It's an honor to join you for the launching of Segye Group's Wrisky.

4
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,530
We're screwed.

5
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,970
No, Jenny. We can do it too.

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,060
I won't make this long.

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,600
With Actor Nam Yun Hyeok as the face, we at Team 1

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,270
will completely recreate Segye Soju as Wrisky.

9
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,180
Using Segye Soju's characteristics, which are a higher alcohol percentage and unique aroma,

10
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:46,000
we'll target the 23% alcohol percentage

11
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,400
   

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,390
soju market.

13
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:53,780
We could move forward as soon as we change the packaging design.

14
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,450
We already contacted the production and marketing companies.

15
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,700
You're cheating too much.

16
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,840
There's no point in giving an advantage to the stronger team.

17
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,650
You're a newbie but too good, Mr. Jo Eun Gu.

18
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:08,350
Jo Eun Gu?

19
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:10,390
He's So Eun Ho, not Jo Eun Gu.

20
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:12,370
Was it So Eun Ho?

21
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:18,150
Anyway!

22
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:20,920
Team Leader Do,

23
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,610
you scored for the first time.

24
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,480
Yes.

25
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:28,220
Let's just go in this direction.

26
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:29,760
Thank you, Chief.

27
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,190
Congratulations.

28
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:33,910
W-Wait, Chief.

29
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,810
Aren't you going to see our presentation?

30
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,610
Do you have one?

31
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:42,150
You have a brand identity as exclusive as that?

32
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:47,010
Yes.

33
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:49,590
Of course,

34
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,830
we can't afford celebrity marketing.

35
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:55,380
But through Jenny—

36
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:59,970
Segye Soju needs a star now though.

37
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,520
Not a high school graduate like her.

38
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,250
- He keeps calling me that— 
  - Come on, come on. 

39
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,840
   

40
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,660
Let's go.

41
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,620
He's over there! Nam Yun Hyeok!

42
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,830
 Mr. Nam Yun Hyeok! 

43
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,860
- Nam Yun Hyeok. 
 - Mr. Nam!

44
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,660
- Mr. Nam. 
 - Something must have happened.

45
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,290
Are the drug accusations that just came out true?

46
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,970
It's being reported that not only did you smoke marijuana, but you were seen dealing too.

47
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,170
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

48
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:31,690
- What are they talking about? 
 - Do you have anything to say?

49
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:35,650
There are already photos of you on the internet.

50
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,460
- What's going on? 
 - Is it really true? 
    

51
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:41,210
"The police ambushed Actor Nam Yun Hyeok's residence after receiving a report on drug use.

52
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:44,580
He was seen purchasing enough marijuana for 300 people?"

53
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,870
 - Mr. Nam! 
 - Say something! 

54
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,670
Were you behind all this?

55
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,910
I told you.

56
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,690
I don't intend on losing.

57
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:56,740
Are you serious, you asshole?

58
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:01,660
- Hey. 
 - I'm doing it. I'm doing it.

59
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,250
- Drink, drink, drink! 
 - I'm doing it.

60
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,900
Drink, drink, drink!

61
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,400
Just take it easy.

62
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:17,910
If you go any further, even the mighty Kang Na Eon can't help you.

63
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,690
Geez, you little...!

64
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:23,030
Mr. Nam! Did you sign an ad contract with Seongsu Agency?

65
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:25,810
What is going to happen to the projects and commercials you are filming?

66
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,950
Okay, okay, okay.

67
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,080
Relax first, everyone.

68
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,430
It's Hwang Jae Ha!

69
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,240
- Chief Hwang Jae Ha, the youngest son of Segye Group! 
 - Mr. Hwang Jae Ha!

70
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:36,890
Is Segye Group signing a contract with Nam Yun Hyeok?

71
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,540
What will you do about the contract in the works at the moment?

72
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,160
Call the police!

73
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,850
Gosh, so why did he keep wearing slippers?

74
00:03:48,850 --> 00:03:51,620
They have him completely surrounded.

75
00:03:54,050 --> 00:04:02,130


76
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,950
   

77
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:10,740
   

78
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,610
   

79
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,970
   

80
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,270
   

81
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:33,410
   

82
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,860
Chief Hwang Jae Ha is here.

83
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:08,910
Gosh... I'm in an awful mood today.

84
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,700
I'll leave everything to you.

85
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,740
Seongsu Agency and Segye Group made headlines over a shameful incident.

86
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,000
Everything will get resolved shortly.

87
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:29,020
There was a bit of an issue with Mr. So Eun Ho being in charge of the project.

88
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,170
Are you passing responsibility to a new recruit?

89
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:35,650
I'm not passing responsibility. I trusted him to take charge.

90
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,800
That's how you trained Na Eon too.

91
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:45,280
And, So Eun Ho insisted that Nam Yun Hyeok sign the contract, not me in fact.

92
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,350
My gosh. We need to reward him then.

93
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:52,320
- Pardon? 
 - He created a very thorough contract.

94
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:57,180
We actually received some money as compensation thanks to him.

95
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,000
But thanks to you,

96
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,540
I got a hefty hospital bill.

97
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,960
What's going on?

98
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,470
Looks like you approved it without even reading the contract.

99
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:18,610
No, it's not like that.

100
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:24,350
Looks like the team leader position doesn't suit you, Yu Mi.

101
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,700
Okay. We'll discipline Team Leader Do to conclude this and—

102
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,030
You can't do this, Chief!

103
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,740
Shut the mouth.

104
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:44,070
By the way, what do we do about Segye Soju now?

105
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:51,120
I heard you prepared a team for a situation like this.

106
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,180
Oh. I did, didn't I?

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,300
Great job.

108
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:00,110
Kang Na Eon.

109
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,220
Why do you keep following me, Mr. So?

110
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,130
We're not even on the same team.

111
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,590
Don't get scared.

112
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,160
I'm here to support you.

113
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,750
I don't feel supported at all.

114
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,700
If so...

115
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,870
why don't you cheer me on properly?

116
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:45,150
Prove it to them.

117
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:50,710
I actually like your branding direction.

118
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,610
I'll still...

119
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,310
be upset for 10 days.

120
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:21,250
Take care.

121
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,300
You put all of this in motion, didn't you?

122
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:32,970
Did you approach me to do this—

123
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,080
I told you.

124
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,000
You need to have what the other person wants the most

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,280
to win the fight.

126
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,150
Who do you think you are?

127
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:44,170
What do you have, exactly?

128
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:49,090
It's what you wanted so badly.

129
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,850
Kang Na Eon's... everything.

130
00:08:58,780 --> 00:09:01,770
Fighting...Do Yu Mi.

131
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:30,760
I'll start the presentation for Segye Soju's rebranding.

132
00:09:35,070 --> 00:09:39,280
How much liquor can you handle?

133
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:50,710
Well, maybe one or two glasses of whiskey?

134
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,940
How about you, Chief Hwang?

135
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:58,960
You need to handle some liquor to flirt with women and stuff.

136
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,920
Well, yes.

137
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:05,920
People used to say this often back in the day.

138
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,270
"You should know how to handle some liquor."

139
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,500
Yes.

140
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:13,490
You need to be able to handle some liquor to get to know people.

141
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:15,310
That's correct.

142
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,790
However, according to a recent study 66% of millennials and Gen Zs

143
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:23,940
wish to drink less alcohol.

144
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,630
And the alcohol consumption rate is decreasing globally too.

145
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:30,590
Hold on.

146
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:33,710
Aren't you telling us what So Eun Ho or whoever already said?

147
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,080
Saying not to sell alcohol.

148
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,540
No, I'm not. We're going to.

149
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:42,590
Instead,

150
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:46,740
to people who can't handle liquor well.

151
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:49,260
What's she saying?

152
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,880
People say they get drunk with the mood.

153
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:03,440
 A satisfying mood from drinking a beer after work. 

154
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,630
 A fun mood from hanging out with the people you connect with. 

155
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:13,780
 A romantic mood from the night you whispered romantic words to your lover. 

156
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,340
 - And maybe it was a mood... 
 - Cheers! 

157
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,900
 we were in on many first occasions. 

158
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:31,260
Hold on, hold on. Isn't that a school uniform?

159
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:35,210
I know it's supposed to be sentimental but that's not right.

160
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:37,040
It's okay.

161
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,280
Because Se Gye Group will be selling the safest liquor in the world.

162
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,340
Safest liquor?

163
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:49,470
With family, friends and lovers.

164
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:54,180
It's something men and women, old or young, can enjoy together.

165
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:59,050
I present you Mood, Segye Soju's nonalcoholic drink line.

166
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:03,690
   

167
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,550
-Non-alcholic? 
 - No way.

168
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:10,320
Can you even sell something like that?

169
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:13,670
Nonalcoholic?

170
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:21,010
Although the alcohol consumption has been decreasing globally,

171
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:25,890
the nonalcoholic drink market has been growing, 14 trillion won  (~$751 million)  in 2022.

172
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:28,880
It's considered a niche market right now,

173
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,450
but considering that alcohol consumption has been decreasing in Korea,

174
00:12:32,450 --> 00:12:37,170
it's likely to fall below 50% in five years.

175
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:40,330
This means the niche market we're targeting

176
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:43,700
might become a mainstream market in the future.

177
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,980
I think it's worth giving it a shot.

178
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,360
I don't usually say this to anyone.

179
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:59,420
I was acting tough when I brought up women. I actually can't drink.

180
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,250
I'm an "BW".

181
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,220
It's LW. It's short for lightweight.

182
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,640
It's lightweight?

183
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,510
Wasn't it bitterweight since the alcohol is bitter?

184
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:13,640
Anyway...

185
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:26,000
It's interesting. Go in that direction.

186
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,890
Okay. Thank you.

187
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:35,750
By the way, how will you promote it?

188
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,900
You don't have to worry about that.

189
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,020
We have a very special influencer on our team.

190
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,300
Get your IDs ready quickly.

191
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,450
- It's been so long. 
 - Show me your wrists.

192
00:13:57,450 --> 00:13:59,790
You look so pretty today, Honey.

193
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:03,100
Welcome. Let me check your IDs first.

194
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,010
My gosh, you're just a baby.

195
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,160
Have fun. Please spread the word.

196
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,800
Take lots of photos.

197
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,580
Mood night. Party time.

198
00:14:12,580 --> 00:14:15,890
Yes, please come this way.

199
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,450
Pose.

200
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,270
Come this way.

201
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,660
Please be careful.

202
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:24,140
Please come this way.

203
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:26,190
It's such a great mood here.

204
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,840
Come this way.

205
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,580
Okay. We got to go. All right.

206
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,800
What's the deal? I thought he was coming.

207
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,400
What?

208
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,020
Huh? Jeong Woo Sunbae...

209
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,530
Cha Jeong Wu.

210
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,870
Are you okay, Na Eon?

211
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:51,700
Gosh! Of course I'm okay.

212
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,610
No, I'm not okay.

213
00:14:56,610 --> 00:14:58,460
You mean the peach drink right?

214
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:01,240
Hey. You should've warned me sooner.

215
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,040
I almost died from itchiness.

216
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,610
I'm sorry. I was going to tell you but...

217
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,050
You're too serious.

218
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,860
I'm sorry about that too.

219
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:18,600
Jeong Woo, you can't apologize like that.

220
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:22,350
Be manly and confident. Say, "Sorry!"

221
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:40,690
Manly... and confident?

222
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:46,480
Come on, Team Leader. Team Leader!

223
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,810
You act so shy in these situations.

224
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,900
Newbie, go ahead and escort him.

225
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,730
I'm okay. Go check it out inside.

226
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,170
Why don't you...

227
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,260
come with us, Team Leader? Let's go!

228
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,230
Yes, let's go.

229
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:03,370
Yes, let's go!

230
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,270
Team Leader, Team Leader. The drink.

231
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:09,270
Drink, drink. Let's get drunk!

232
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,940
Come here!

233
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:24,510
Hey, you need to come join us.

234
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,450
Unni, not those guys.

235
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:40,480
Come on, don't be like that.

236
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,150
All of us together. Mood. Don't you know?

237
00:16:43,150 --> 00:16:45,570
Mood! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move!

238
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,940
Move! Move! Move! Move!

239
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,320
- Come on. Teachers, come over here. 
 - It's okay.

240
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,500
Come on, come on.

241
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,970
Let's get going.

242
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,720
Move! Move! Move!

243
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,930
 Dance! Dance! Dance! Dance! 

244
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,760
 Dance! Dance! 

245
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,720
Gather around!

246
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,010
Gather around!

247
00:17:26,070 --> 00:17:28,350
Nice, nice!

248
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,780
Let's dance, let's dance!

249
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,200
Jenny, Jenny, Jenny.

250
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,210
 Jenny! Jenny! Jenny! Jenny! 

251
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:44,040
 Jenny! Jenny! Jenny! 

252
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,000
The party...

253
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,350
starts now.

254
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,540
Okay!

255
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,050
I'll post this.

256
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,370
   

257
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:09,160
 Get drunk with the Mood. 

258
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,370
 It's okay if you can't handle alcohol. 

259
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:14,550
 The Mood night party anyone can enjoy. 

260
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:17,160
 A huge success. 

261
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,040
Sunbae.

262
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,410
Do you want a glass?

263
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,590
Sunbae.

264
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:32,380
Let's go, let's go.

265
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,630
It's about the Mood.

266
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:40,590
Huh? Where did the soju go?

267
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:44,160
- What? 
 - This is real soju with the labels switched out.

268
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,100
Where did they go?

269
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,770
Cheers.

270
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,970
By the way, why did you try to leave?

271
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,490
I just wanted to let you enjoy your victory.

272
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:13,330
This is your first time... winning a project by competing properly isn't it?

273
00:20:13,330 --> 00:20:15,660
Yes!

274
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:23,780
By the way, why didn't you tell me the plan this time?

275
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,030
Because you knew I'd do well on my own?

276
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:31,740
Because I knew you'd tell everyone with your loose lips.

277
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,950
I'll be angry for 10 more days then.

278
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,660
Come on. Come on.

279
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,360
You're not supposed to pour your own drink.

280
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,040
Give me that.

281
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,030
I feel more comfortable drinking on my own.

282
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,190
I'll have to make you feel uncomfortable from now on.

283
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:05,020
Don't drink by yourself even after we switch back.

284
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,150
You should...

285
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,480
drink with me, the handsome guy.

286
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,060
I.A.U.S!

287
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,290
It's all about the unwavering spirit!

288
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,200
Seriously.

289
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:36,080
Cheers.

290
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,120
Cheers.

291
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,760
How nice.

292
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,240
The weather is nice, too.

293
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,570
   

294
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:11,240
Just one second.

295
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,820
Where are you going?

296
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:16,780
It's not Yu Mi. Don't worry.

297
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,950
I'm worried.

298
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,090
It looks like it's something more serious.

299
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:26,610
So Eun Ho. I'll keep your body safe—

300
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,690
Not me. You.

301
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:31,250
I'm worried about you, Sunbae.

302
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,530
Why?

303
00:22:53,850 --> 00:22:56,320
The man who was behind Do Yu Mi.

304
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:04,100
He must have found out I did everything, including the Nam Yun Hyeok scandal.

305
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:08,420
Is that who just sent you that message?

306
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,040
Probably.

307
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,840
So it is something dangerous.

308
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,940
He found out everything, but he still reached out. That means...

309
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,830
he wants So Eun Ho.

310
00:23:19,830 --> 00:23:22,350
Who's that person?

311
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,620
Is it Hwang Jae Ha by chance?

312
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:38,160
You need to come back safely.

313
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,710
Promise.

314
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,020
Are you drunk?

315
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,460
Why are you acting so cringeworthy?

316
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:49,890
There's a little bit of alcohol in nonalcoholic drinks too.

317
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,820
I guess that's why I'm a bit drunk.

318
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:13,870


319
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,000
I guess I'm also drunk...

320
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,130
a little bit.

321
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:47,100
♫  After the wave of thoughts came to a stop  ♫

322
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:52,610
♫  The sadness overflows  ♫

323
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:59,440
♫  I'm holding back  ♫

324
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:04,050
♫  My heart that overflows again with hope  ♫

325
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:07,260
♫  After hesitating  ♫

326
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:10,930
♫  I'm hesitating, mmm ~  ♫

327
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:14,000
♫  The words  ♫

328
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,980
♫  Just flow out like this  ♫

329
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:24,210
♫  My days and nights are all about you, so much so that I forget myself  ♫

330
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:29,340
♫  So will you stay with me?  ♫

331
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:36,500
♫  You've taken over my heart, my thoughts and everything I am  ♫

332
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:41,060
♫  So can you give me just this one chance?  ♫

333
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:44,220
♫  If you understand me   ♫

334
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,840
♫  When I hesitate  ♫

335
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,900
♫  You are my all  ♫

336
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:58,090
♫  The last entry in my diary  ♫

337
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,940
   

338
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:14,700
♫  Honestly, I hope the story of my unsettled heart reaches you  ♫

339
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,990
♫  After hesitating  ♫

340
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:21,770
♫  Hesitating, mmm ~  ♫

341
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:27,830
♫  Finally, I'm calling out for you tonight  ♫

342
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:34,950
♫  My days and nights are all about you, so much so that I forget myself  ♫

343
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:40,110
♫  So will you stay with me?  ♫

344
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:47,670
♫  You've taken over my heart, my thoughts and everything I am   ♫
