- Congratulations. - Hello, sir.

186
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:22,879
You've agreed to move your factory after protesting against it.

187
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,179
- Hey, what are you doing? - Can we have a comment?

188
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,549
- Get out. - This is a prime spot in Seongsu...

189
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,519
- I said, get out! - Do you plan to...

190
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,590
Get out.

191
00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:30,419
Who said you could come in here? Get out.

192
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,991
Get out!

196

They've all received their payments,

197
00:15:49,841 --> 00:15:51,941
and they signed the pledge that they would never protest again.

198
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,850
It's nice to be funded by a big company.

199
00:15:53,851 --> 00:15:55,820
They all got paid way more than what they'd earn...

200
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,721
by making shoes that wouldn't even sell.

201
00:15:57,981 --> 00:16:01,390
The thing is, one shoemaker keeps refusing to settle.

202
00:16:01,621 --> 00:16:02,920
The representative of the shoemakers.

203
00:16:03,461 --> 00:16:05,221
He'll probably show up to protest again today.

204
00:16:11,231 --> 00:16:12,430
What are you going to do?

205
00:16:16,741 --> 00:16:17,800
Yoo Mi.

206
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,341
You should manage your own team once I join the head office.

207
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:24,941
Yes, I should.

208
00:16:26,481 --> 00:16:27,550
But you know what?

209
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:31,321
I'll disapprove of you before anyone else does.

210
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,091
You still have a lot to learn.

211
00:16:33,691 --> 00:16:36,621
What am I supposed to do? We offered him money, but he wouldn't budge.

212
00:16:38,861 --> 00:16:40,790
What is the most precious thing to him?

213
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,900
You need to use it as your weapon to negotiate with him.

214
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,081

Hey, what are you doing?

216
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,720
I guess you got chewed out again.

217
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,801
Yoo Mi, don't you think it's unfair?

218
00:17:21,031 --> 00:17:22,170
I mean,

219

220
00:17:25,501 --> 00:17:27,910

It doesn't matter if they're her teammates or superiors.

228
00:17:48,831 --> 00:17:51,700
Once she thinks you're useless, she ditches you right away.

229

230
00:17:58,501 --> 00:17:59,740

- Calm down. - I'm recording this now.

241
00:18:26,831 --> 00:18:28,830
Sir, how many times do we have to tell you?

242
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:30,300
- Hey, I'm scared. - It's okay.

243
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:31,500
The owner of this building...

244
00:18:31,501 --> 00:18:34,111
signed a lease with us!

245
00:18:34,271 --> 00:18:36,311
Did you bribe all those people to do this?

246
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:39,450
You people cannot buy this place with chump change.

247
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:42,210

248

252
00:19:18,751 --> 00:19:20,450
I'm the one in charge.

253
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,730
We did not want to buy it up with chump change,

254
00:19:31,001 --> 00:19:34,400

Take the money...

261
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,761
and take your family out for a nice meal.

262
00:20:06,501 --> 00:20:07,900
Your daughter...

263
00:20:08,371 --> 00:20:10,200
really misses you.

264
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,111
Darn you.

265
00:20:14,371 --> 00:20:15,511

00:20:16,311 --> 00:20:17,480

Hey, let go.

271
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:27,920

272
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,790

274
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:31,989
Let go!

275
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,361

277
00:20:43,571 --> 00:20:44,771

Don't tell me...

281
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,630
you planned all this.

282
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:17,470
I had no idea you'd step in like that though.

283
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,880
No matter where the property is,

284
00:21:25,081 --> 00:21:27,880
evicting a long-term tenant could cost you a lot of money.

285
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,450
XU wouldn't gladly pay up...

286
00:21:32,581 --> 00:21:34,390
all the workers,

287
00:21:34,621 --> 00:21:36,660
so I needed a weapon to negotiate with them,

288
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,730
and you showed up.

289
00:21:41,490 --> 00:21:42,900
And this looks like...

290
00:21:43,031 --> 00:21:44,261
a great spot for the pop-up store.

291
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,970
And about XU Beauty.

292
00:21:48,331 --> 00:21:50,870
Rumour has it that they don't actually use vegan ingredients.

293
00:21:50,871 --> 00:21:52,940
Some even say they still test on animals.

294
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:54,371
Visit the factory tomorrow.

295
00:21:54,611 --> 00:21:57,840
Then if I find something while working hard at the factory...

296
00:21:57,841 --> 00:22:00,150
I really hope you do.

297
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,051
How convenient.

298
00:22:04,321 --> 00:22:05,450
As if...

299
00:22:05,821 --> 00:22:08,291
you've been waiting for something to happen.

300
00:22:10,061 --> 00:22:11,521

301
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:13,690
The bigger,

302
00:22:15,091 --> 00:22:16,230
the better.

303

304
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,271
Thanks to you, all the workers...

305
00:22:26,371 --> 00:22:28,511
were compensated fairly.

306
00:22:31,611 --> 00:22:32,680
You two.

307
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,810

311

And the animal oils?

312
00:22:45,261 --> 00:22:47,091
Even if we can't right the wrongs,

313
00:22:48,061 --> 00:22:49,700
we don't have to help them cover them up.

00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,980
