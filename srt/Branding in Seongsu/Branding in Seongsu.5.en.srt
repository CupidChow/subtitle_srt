What's this?

00:00:48,241 --> 00:00:49,311
So Eun Ho?

7
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:54,111
Where is my body?

8
00:01:05,861 --> 00:01:08,190
Dr. Kwon, Mr. So has come around!

9
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,531
- Mr. So, are you okay? - Mr. So.

10
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:12,001
Mr. So.

11
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,471
Are you all right?

12
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,440
Why am I So Eun Ho?

13
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:18,671
What happened?

14
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:21,440
Your heart stopped.

15
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,981
- Fortunately, you... - Not him. What happened to me?

16
00:01:24,781 --> 00:01:26,880
- Kang Na Eon. - Pardon?

17
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,850
What happened to Kang Na Eon?

18
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,819
A female patient called Kang Na Eun...

19
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,650
was sent to the hospital on the same night.

20
00:01:33,651 --> 00:01:35,090
She's in the intensive care unit.

21
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:37,091
Ms. Jung, don't say something like that.

22
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:39,030
Mr. So.

23
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:41,660

- You're not allowed to enter. - You're not allowed to enter.

27
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,989
- Where are you going? - Please go back to your room.

29
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,540
That night,

30
00:02:32,211 --> 00:02:33,711
Kang Na Eon died.

(Seongdong University Hospital)

35
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,170
You were in critical condition as well.

36
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:37,841
Even though your CT scan and MRI results were fine,

37
00:03:38,311 --> 00:03:40,009
you were unconscious for as long as a month.

38
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,281
What about Kang Na Eon?

39
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:43,849
As I told you, only her guardian...

40
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,820
She doesn't have a family.

41
00:03:46,021 --> 00:03:49,461
- In that case, we can't... - Chlordiazepoxide.

42
00:03:50,621 --> 00:03:52,491
You would know well because you're her doctor.

43
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,461
That she's been taking it...

44
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:57,230
without a prescription in this hospital.

45
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,831
Are you threatening me?

46
00:04:00,471 --> 00:04:03,100
It means...

47
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,440
I'm her only guardian.

48
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,720
Even if you're her guardian,

49
00:04:17,721 --> 00:04:20,250
all I can give you are her belongings.

50
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,831
"Soul swapping."

51
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:30,799
(Is soul swapping possible?)

52
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,230
I woke up, and a soul swap happened.

53
00:04:33,471 --> 00:04:34,730
Is this possible?

54
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,240
Did you wake up as a member of a family who owns a conglomerate?

55
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:41,470
Please wake up to reality, not a fantasy world.

56
00:04:41,471 --> 00:04:42,710
(What should I do to swap souls?)

57
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:43,840
(It's impossible in real life.)

58
00:04:43,841 --> 00:04:46,780
In regards to the fall of Ms. Kang,

59
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:48,080
the person in charge of the XU Beauty incident,

60
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:50,479
the police assume that it was an attempted suicide...

61
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,720
due to emotional burden.

62
00:04:51,721 --> 00:04:53,119
A month after the incident,

63
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,489
- What? - the case is closed...

64
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,619
- A suicide? - with no evidence of crime.

65
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,159
It's assumed that she committed suicide...

66
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,430
because of her dismissal due to the incident.

67
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:03,960
The criticism of Ms. Kang after the XU Beauty incident...

68
00:05:03,961 --> 00:05:04,999
is redirected...

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,201
to Seongsu Agency.

70
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,739
Right? She was just an employee.

71
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,271
She must've done it as she was told by the company.

72
00:05:12,109 --> 00:05:13,308
I'm guilty.

73
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:17,779
I'm guilty of underestimating those people who hated me.

74
00:05:19,578 --> 00:05:20,708
What is he talking about?

75
00:05:23,878 --> 00:05:25,518
(Recents: 911, Cha Jung Woo, So Eun Ho)

76
00:05:26,119 --> 00:05:27,148

79

What's this?

80
00:05:37,029 --> 00:05:39,198
Did he use my phone to report?

81
00:05:41,669 --> 00:05:42,799
I can't.

82
00:05:43,568 --> 00:05:46,138
So you're the lover of Kang Na Eon who lived at the penthouse?

83
00:05:46,369 --> 00:05:47,908
Dozens of people come here...

84
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:50,279
and claim that they're her boyfriend every day.

85
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:13,969
It's a piece of cake.

86
00:06:25,549 --> 00:06:28,148
Darn it. It's so high.

87
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,429
(Identification card: So Eun Ho)

88
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:45,969
You jerk.

00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:54,808
(To So Eun Ho)

90
00:06:58,179 --> 00:06:59,208
I came to the right place.

91
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,719
What's all this?

92
00:07:22,438 --> 00:07:23,539
A lock?

93
00:07:25,739 --> 00:07:26,909
It says, "0524."

95
00:07:48,799 --> 00:07:50,799

five.

97
00:08:02,078 --> 00:08:03,179
No way.

98
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:13,448
What's with this guy?

99
00:08:55,128 --> 00:08:57,498
What a clear theme.

100
00:09:15,579 --> 00:09:16,619
Gosh.

101
00:09:18,178 --> 00:09:19,788
Who wears stuff like this?

102
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:28,059
It's awful.

103
00:09:41,908 --> 00:09:43,479
It wasn't a senseless crime.

104
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:50,079
It was definitely...

105
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:54,148
A planned murder caused by a personal grudge.

106
00:10:19,809 --> 00:10:21,548
Do you think you can do anything with money?

107
00:10:22,449 --> 00:10:23,878
Is it that repairman?

108
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:27,719
To find someone closer...

109
00:10:27,989 --> 00:10:29,689
Do you think you're so important?

110
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:31,219
Is it Mr. Nam?

111
00:10:35,128 --> 00:10:37,329
I'm going to be the first one to kill you!

112
00:10:38,158 --> 00:10:39,229
Do Yoo Mi?

113
00:10:41,729 --> 00:10:44,339
- Director Han? - You worked very hard.

114
00:10:48,268 --> 00:10:49,408
Or...

115
00:10:49,508 --> 00:10:50,878
A detective came by.

116
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:52,709
He asked me about you.

117
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:55,208
You were found...

118
00:10:55,209 --> 00:10:56,878
near a handmade shoe factory that night.

119
00:11:00,189 --> 00:11:01,949
So I'm a suspect too?

120
00:11:08,559 --> 00:11:09,699
So Eun Ho?

121
00:11:11,229 --> 00:11:12,298
Is it you?

122
00:11:16,638 --> 00:11:17,839
No way.

123
00:11:26,849 --> 00:11:28,048
Is it a blackout or what?

124
00:11:35,119 --> 00:11:38,459
Eun Ho is fine.

125
00:11:42,859 --> 00:11:43,928
I don't know.

126
00:11:58,178 --> 00:12:00,748
It pointlessly smells nice.

127
00:12:24,668 --> 00:12:25,739
Gosh.

128
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:30,278
I knew I wouldn't sleep well.

129
00:12:38,678 --> 00:12:39,719
Darn it.

130
00:12:52,298 --> 00:12:54,298
There's a good thing about this body too.

131
00:13:02,378 --> 00:13:03,609
What's this?

132
00:13:04,008 --> 00:13:05,978
He's an oldie.

133
00:13:05,979 --> 00:13:07,849
Oh, my.

134
00:13:08,008 --> 00:13:09,479
This one is slightly better.

135
00:13:13,648 --> 00:13:15,189
Is he a national athlete or what?

136
00:13:43,479 --> 00:13:44,648
Is that him?

137
00:13:44,878 --> 00:13:47,548
He looks so different. I didn't recognize him.

138
00:13:47,888 --> 00:13:49,319
Can he leave the hospital already?

139
00:13:49,418 --> 00:13:51,689
Does he know that he was assigned to Team Underdog?

140
00:14:04,038 --> 00:14:05,738

(Do Yoo Mi, manager)

143
00:14:09,979 --> 00:14:11,138
(We're announcing the redeployment in the 4th quarter of 2023.)

144
00:14:13,579 --> 00:14:14,678
Do Yoo Mi?

145
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:16,478
That's interesting.

146
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:18,177
- Good work. - You worked hard.

147
00:14:18,178 --> 00:14:20,287
- Thank you. - Thank you.

148
00:14:20,288 --> 00:14:22,089
- Oh, my gosh. - Gosh.

149
00:14:24,518 --> 00:14:26,828
As soon as the result of the investigation on Ms. Kang came out?

150
00:14:26,829 --> 00:14:27,829
No way.

151
00:14:27,928 --> 00:14:31,627
There was a reason that her members were assigned to Team Underdog.

152
00:14:31,628 --> 00:14:34,667
I heard everyone chose to resign...

153
00:14:34,668 --> 00:14:36,739
- instead of going to Underdog. - Really?

154
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:39,839
Except...

155
00:14:40,408 --> 00:14:41,508
for him.

156
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,248
Why would they resign instead of going to Underdog?

157
00:14:46,349 --> 00:14:48,778
It's because they can't build a career...

158
00:14:50,178 --> 00:14:52,349
I guess I should devote my life to this company then.

159
00:14:56,619 --> 00:14:57,658
Let's go.

160
00:14:58,388 --> 00:15:00,859
After the meeting...

161
00:15:01,229 --> 00:15:03,498
We're on the same team. Thank you in advance.

162
00:15:05,298 --> 00:15:07,068
Oh, right. I'm going to the head office...

163
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:08,228
to get the letter of appointment.

164
00:15:08,229 --> 00:15:09,398
Are you going to come?

165
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:22,949
You're Na Eon's intern boyfriend.

166
00:15:24,418 --> 00:15:26,648
I heard you had been sent to the hospital on the same day.

167
00:15:27,489 --> 00:15:29,258
Were you guys seeing each other for real?

168
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:31,189
What happened?

169
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:32,528
What do you mean?

170
00:15:36,758 --> 00:15:39,199
Did you do that to Na Eon?

171
00:15:40,768 --> 00:15:41,869
I see.

172
00:15:45,699 --> 00:15:47,339
I wanted to,

173
00:15:48,268 --> 00:15:49,839
but she did it by herself.

174
00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:51,638
It's a pity.

175
00:15:53,579 --> 00:15:56,047
I guess you've lost your mind after becoming a full-time employee.

176
00:15:56,048 --> 00:15:57,619
Stop talking to me informally.

177
00:15:57,878 --> 00:15:59,418
And figure out whom you should side with.

I...

184
00:16:54,869 --> 00:16:57,079
don't have to worry about Na Eon, right?

185

204

205
00:18:01,938 --> 00:18:03,478
- Right. - My words came true.

206

But our product has 21g of protein.

322
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:59,999
