What is this place?

20
00:03:34,822 --> 00:03:36,391
You must have a lot to ask about.

21
00:03:37,092 --> 00:03:38,761
Are you being serious?

22
00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:40,062
I have a lot to ask about too.

23
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:47,801
Do you even remember?

24
00:03:48,611 --> 00:03:49,641
Remember what?

When we first met two years ago,

27
00:03:58,011 --> 00:04:00,322
you still didn't seem to know anything.

28
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:05,161
The marketing strategy and model is just the same...

29
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,592
as the rival company.

at all.

What is it that you want to say?

00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:36,992
That wasn't our first encounter.

Bring back that memory.

39
00:04:48,471 --> 00:04:49,601

I can't believe her.

71

Well, who do we have here?

127

You brought in a new employee... and stopped me...

from getting near the HQ Motors deal.

129
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,652
You've found out...

130
00:14:02,392 --> 00:14:03,751
about our partnership already?

131
00:14:04,652 --> 00:14:05,822
That's no fun.

132
00:14:07,562 --> 00:14:10,091

Killing Kang Na Eon.

135
00:14:20,701 --> 00:14:22,641
You're talking like you have something...

136
00:14:22,642 --> 00:14:24,711
you can kill me with.

137
00:14:28,211 --> 00:14:29,782
I already had it...

138
00:14:30,581 --> 00:14:31,951
five years ago.

139
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,351
It really got me curious too.

140

What will So Eun Ho do to Manager Kang...

141
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,461
if he finds out?

142
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:46,461
Will he really kill you?

143
00:14:52,131 --> 00:14:53,601
Rather than worrying about me,

144
00:14:54,302 --> 00:14:56,912
you should worry about your life first.

145
00:14:57,341 --> 00:14:59,142
I have nothing to be worried about.

146
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:02,812
I am blameless.

147
00:15:04,581 --> 00:15:06,221
I'm the bad guy as always.

148
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,111
You have such a great idea, but no one recognizes it.

149
00:15:35,312 --> 00:15:37,581
If a big company like Segye Group does the marketing,

150
00:15:38,711 --> 00:15:40,750
it will be great as more people will know about it.

151
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:42,022
You're on that again.

152
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,321
The brand's identity comes from...

153
00:15:46,322 --> 00:15:48,022
the one who came up with that idea.

154
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:50,990
What's the point of using Segye Group's name...

155
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,292
and hiring masters?

156
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:55,870
It's nice to have a lot of people know about it,

157
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:59,201
but if there's just one person who can earnestly love our brand,

158
00:15:59,542 --> 00:16:00,841
that makes me happier.

159
00:16:01,542 --> 00:16:02,711
You're so cool.

160
00:16:03,142 --> 00:16:04,511
Then is the Bandi Candle...

161
00:16:04,512 --> 00:16:06,411

162
00:16:06,412 --> 00:16:08,942
Oh, get lost.

163
00:16:09,211 --> 00:16:10,351
But for me,

164
00:16:12,481 --> 00:16:15,182
I want to make your brand a global one, Da Eun.

165
00:16:16,552 --> 00:16:17,822
That's my dream.

166
00:16:19,262 --> 00:16:20,361
What is this?

00:16:22,532 --> 00:16:23,562

I'll see you at Segye Group.

171
00:16:56,331 --> 00:16:57,361
I'll see you there.

- What? - What?

175
00:17:27,262 --> 00:17:29,690
But you said you were going to step away from it.

176
00:17:29,691 --> 00:17:32,061
You refused to do it yourself.

177
00:17:32,062 --> 00:17:33,732
Why are you changing your mind?

178
00:17:34,202 --> 00:17:36,101
If you don't want to do it, leave.

179
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:38,231
- No. That's not what we meant. - No. That's not what we meant.

180
00:17:38,232 --> 00:17:40,100
- We just... - In this situation...

181
00:17:40,101 --> 00:17:41,302
Just leave.

182
00:17:42,371 --> 00:17:43,812
- Okay. - Okay.

183
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:08,131
I felt anxious to have it with me so I printed a copy and deleted it.

184
00:18:08,401 --> 00:18:10,302
I'm afraid to do more of this.

185
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:24,911
This isn't enough.

186
00:18:26,282 --> 00:18:28,282
To find Director Han's weakness,

187
00:18:30,822 --> 00:18:32,151
I must bring back...

188
00:18:32,822 --> 00:18:34,421
the HQ Motors deal.

189
00:18:42,601 --> 00:18:45,371
Has our Na Eon decided to become a loner again?

190
00:18:47,202 --> 00:18:48,972
Did you see the gift I prepared for you?

191
00:18:50,072 --> 00:18:51,141
Yoo Mi.

192
00:18:52,042 --> 00:18:54,282
I have no time to hang around with you.

193
00:18:54,812 --> 00:18:56,410
Five years ago,

194
00:18:56,411 --> 00:18:59,052
I definitely saw him. Why couldn't I remember?

195
00:18:59,851 --> 00:19:01,552
I would've told you right away had I remembered.

196
00:19:03,891 --> 00:19:05,691
That the real owner of the Bandi Candle you stole...

197
00:19:06,262 --> 00:19:07,921
has appeared.

198
00:19:08,861 --> 00:19:11,191
- You little... - So it was you!

199
00:19:11,591 --> 00:19:13,202
I was just sounding you out.

200
00:19:13,762 --> 00:19:15,801
The idea to use the masters...

201
00:19:15,802 --> 00:19:17,272
was amazing.

202
00:19:18,171 --> 00:19:19,171
But...

203
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:21,542
that wasn't from Kang Na Eon's head.

204
00:19:26,111 --> 00:19:28,110
Was all of the branding you dealt with...

205
00:19:28,111 --> 00:19:29,811
done like this?

206
00:19:29,812 --> 00:19:31,851
- Do Yoo Mi. - What is it?

207
00:19:32,552 --> 00:19:34,621
Are you starting to think you should listen to me?

208
00:19:37,792 --> 00:19:38,822
No.

209
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:41,691
I will bring Director Han down first.

210
00:19:43,861 --> 00:19:46,401
Everyone related to him...

211
00:19:47,302 --> 00:19:48,631
should be careful.

212
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,792
The presentation for HQ Motor's new business promotion...

213
00:20:18,262 --> 00:20:21,531
(HQ Motors New Business and Marketing Presentation)

214
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:22,631
Manager Kang.

215
00:20:23,371 --> 00:20:25,631
I came right away because I didn't have time to send a proposal.

216
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:27,670
You all know who I am, right?

217
00:20:27,671 --> 00:20:28,702
What are you doing right now?

218
00:20:29,042 --> 00:20:30,671
Our presentation begins soon.

219
00:20:31,111 --> 00:20:32,141
All right.

220
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:35,482
There are two unreleased products with the same specifications.

221
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:39,482
Which product will the consumers buy?

222
00:20:39,881 --> 00:20:42,022
- Please leave first. - We can talk later...

223
00:20:45,792 --> 00:20:47,522
If they have the same specifications,

224
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:51,430
consumers will buy the product with the logo of a certified...

225
00:20:51,431 --> 00:20:52,802
and well-known company.

226
00:20:53,562 --> 00:20:54,661
Because it brings trust.

227
00:20:55,161 --> 00:20:56,532
It's the same with branding.

228
00:20:56,831 --> 00:20:58,400
The early advantage...

229
00:20:58,401 --> 00:21:00,202
depends on who did the branding.

230
00:21:01,772 --> 00:21:03,940
The new technology selected and branded...

231
00:21:03,941 --> 00:21:05,572
by Kang Na Eon.

232
00:21:06,141 --> 00:21:09,712
I don't think I would want to miss this chance.

233
00:21:13,181 --> 00:21:15,121
Give me a fair chance to give a presentation.

234
00:21:16,452 --> 00:21:17,891
I will compete with my presentation.

235
00:21:19,421 --> 00:21:22,962
Branding must be done by an expert.

236
00:21:24,361 --> 00:21:25,492
What do I do?

237
00:21:25,861 --> 00:21:27,302
Segye Group...

238
00:21:27,431 --> 00:21:29,702
offered to send an expert.

239
00:21:32,202 --> 00:21:33,272
Will there be...

240
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:35,542
another talent like me in Segye Group?

241
00:21:36,141 --> 00:21:37,242
If that was the case,

242
00:21:38,772 --> 00:21:40,211
they would already have become...

243
00:21:40,212 --> 00:21:42,012
the manager of Seongsu Agency's Team One.

244
00:21:43,282 --> 00:21:44,351
I heard there was.

245
00:21:46,552 --> 00:21:50,391
I heard Segye Group was going to revive their marketing team.

246
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:52,052
I heard the manager of that team...

247
00:21:52,252 --> 00:21:53,891
was going to come for the presentation.

248
00:21:54,391 --> 00:21:57,091
The pop-up stores done recently in Seongsu-dong.

249
00:21:57,661 --> 00:21:59,732
I heard this guy was in charge of them.

250
00:22:13,542 --> 00:22:14,941
I can't believe this guy.

251
00:22:26,361 --> 00:22:27,921
I'm So Eun Ho,

252
00:22:31,631 --> 00:22:32,802
Segye Group's marketing manager.

253
00:22:35,502 --> 00:22:37,772
I told you to reveal the truth and ask for forgiveness.

254
00:22:39,601 --> 00:22:41,901
You're still trying to steal from someone else.

255
00:22:43,812 --> 00:22:45,871
Who do you think you are to behave like this?

256
00:22:46,881 --> 00:22:49,680
You two are basically from the same company. What is this?

257
00:22:49,681 --> 00:22:51,252
Get things sorted out first.

258
00:22:51,351 --> 00:22:52,651
- I will... - I will...

259
00:22:58,651 --> 00:22:59,861
Are you two okay?

260
00:23:01,462 --> 00:23:03,462
Manager Kang?

261
00:23:03,891 --> 00:23:04,962
Manager Kang?

262
00:24:05,452 --> 00:24:06,661
It's the last chance...

263
00:24:08,062 --> 00:24:09,631
for both of you.

264
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:14,401
Good luck.
