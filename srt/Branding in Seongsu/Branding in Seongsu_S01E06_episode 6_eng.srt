1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,650
   

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,980
What are you doing?

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,480
Are you here because you're suspicious of me too?

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:19,050
Do you know how many times I was questioned by the police in the past month?

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,500
I don't trust the police.

6
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:31,780
It's not my style to trust anyone.

7
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,450
Is this your true self?

8
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:47,970
How about you? What's your true self?

9
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,370
A stupid but good-natured shoemaker who bet his family's livelihood

10
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:53,730
on handmade shoes that don't even sell?

11
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,360
- What? 
 - Or...

12
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,660
a disgusting murderer who killed someone...

13
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,270
because of explosive anger?

14
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,840
Look at this guy.

15
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,350
I tried to tolerate you, but—

16
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:09,720
Don't get me wrong. I'm here to help you survive.

17
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,680
    
 Geez...

18
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,430
You've got to be kidding.

19
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,190
You think I'd receive help from you people?

20
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:23,750
Get help if you were victimized

21
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:28,470
and if you victimized someone, get punished yourself.

22
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,080
Hey.

23
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,780
I wouldn't think it unfair if I had killed Kang Na Eon.

24
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,400
I guess you did want to kill her.

25
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,750
I hope you succeed next time.

26
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,470
   

27
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:07,390
   

28
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:09,130
   

29
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:10,520
   

30
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,770
   

31
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:22,310


32
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:31,960
   

33
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,950
     

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,860
   

35
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:46,320
Losers.

36
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,650
Is this bad?

37
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:53,980
Isn't that too much?

38
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,120
- No, it's not. 
 - Hey, Rex.

39
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,170
Don't put on too much.

40
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:59,300
My gosh, newbie.

41
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,710
Welcome.

42
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,990
You came.

43
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,680
Newbie?

44
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,970
Jenny's quiz. Should I keep them on or take them off?

45
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,580
Why do I crave beer while eating a diet snack?

46
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,330
I'll just drink it if I crave it.

47
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,730
Gosh, give me one, too.

48
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,580
Let's all drink together since the newbie's here.

49
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,930
It's party time, right?

50
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,410
It's okay. You just need a nap for 30 minutes afterward. Drink it.

51
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:33,590
I didn't come with any expectations.

52
00:03:48,890 --> 00:03:51,410
But this is still worse than I could have imagined.

53
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,050
Eun Ho!

54
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:01,320
Welcome to our team!

55
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,730
My gosh, I'm so grateful

56
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:07,190
that someone so handsome joined our team.

57
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,280
There you go.

58
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:15,070
Let's take a photo together. One, two, three.

59
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,520
Make my nose pointier, I said.

60
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,270
Just turn me into Pinocchio.

61
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,590
Photoshop my face more.

62
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,450
Is that it?

63
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:33,380
I'll get you a special desk right here, Oppa.

64
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,200
- Ta-da. 
 - Come this way.

65
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,010
I know you're really handsome, 
    

66
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,090
but you're still the newbie after all.

67
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,560
That looks like a good spot.

68
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,270
Eun Ho, that's the team leader's desk.

69
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,660
I think...

70
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:04,880
I deserve to be the team leader... the most here.

71
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,670
I'll work offsite.

72
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,960
What? Already? Aren't we going to have a party?

73
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,210
Look how he's ignoring us.

74
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,150
Team Leader Do wants you in her office.

75
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,880
Team Leader Do?

76
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,160
It's probably regarding the handmade shoe factory.

77
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,780
What factory?

78
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,620
- Let's back up. 
 - Back up what?

79
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,420
Yeong Ae, create a list of celebrities to model for us and figure out their schedules.

80
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,710
Rex, do sketches for the handmade shoe rebranding.

81
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,570
And Jenny, 
    

82
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:35,800
Come on.

83
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,300
- Jenny? 
 - Yes?

84
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,010
Come up with five concepts for social media marketing.

85
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,730
- Me? 
 - She can't do stuff like that.

86
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:50,030
My gosh, he's too sexy.

87
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,320
   

88
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,070
Hey, everyone!

89
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:55,270
We're having fun tonight!

90
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:59,190
Enjoy! Enjoy yourselves!

91
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:04,240
Everyone, Yu Mi's treating you tonight. Drink up!

92
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,560
And our actor. Congratulations on becoming the ambassador.

93
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:14,810
I put this together for you, but you're acting kind of cold.

94
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,910
Hey. Just worry about me, not him.

95
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:21,320
And don't let your company call me about modeling for some weird handmade shoes.

96
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,680
Oh, did they? I'm so sorry.

97
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,660
Say no. I'll get you something else instead.

98
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,840
- Really? 
 - Of course.

99
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,920
- Keep your promise, okay? 
 - Of course.

100
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:31,120
- Cheers. 
 - Cheers.

101
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,630
And for our A-list actor—

102
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:35,550
I'm not sure if you can handle it.

103
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,090
Handle what?

104
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:40,840
Anything. Everything that Kang Na Eon used to handle.

105
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,010
My gosh.

106
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:47,970
You were just a dog that Kang Na Eon used to drag around because she exploited your weakness.

107
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:50,470
Why are you being so loyal?

108
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:56,530
I even had this thought once.

109
00:06:56,530 --> 00:07:02,740
I wondered if you were the reason Na Eon ended up like that.

110
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,970
Come on, let's face it.

111
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:09,500
We all know how much she harassed our A-list actor.

112
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,800
Don't you agree?

113
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,630
Come on, she did. Don't you remember?

114
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:19,860
Stop carelessly pretending... as if you're Kang Na Eon.

115
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,240
You crazy bastard!

116
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,190
- What are you doing? Hey! 
 - Come on.

117
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,470
- Do Yu Mi! 
 - Let go! Didn't you just see him?

118
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,290
That's enough!

119
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,390
Let's stop drinking and leave.

120
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,620
Are you refusing to drink because I'm paying for it?

121
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,690
Are you looking down on me right now?

122
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,720
It's because I was going to drive you home.

123
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,530
Let's go.

124
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:59,190
   

125
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,220
   

126
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,320
 They called 119 using my phone? 

127
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,100
 Maybe... 

128
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:23,210
 the culprit is somewhere close to me. 

129
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,720
 Cha Jeong Woo? 

130
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:43,060
 It's my fault. 

131
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,490
 If only I didn't come up with a design like that... 

132
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:48,990
What a foolish bastard.

133
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,850
 Team Leader Nam. 

134
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,550
Shit. Crazy bastard.

135
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,640
   

136
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,850
   

137
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,690
 Or... Do Yu Mi? 

138
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,250
You must have gotten the call too.

139
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:03,250
Right? Handmade shoes are no good, right?

140
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,550
It's okay to say no.

141
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,550
Yes, thank you. Okay.

142
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,410
Does he think trying hard will get him anywhere?

143
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,120
Why are you going so far?

144
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,620
It's because I f***ing hate him!

145
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:26,520
Didn't you see So Eun Ho acting like he's Kang Na Eon or something?

146
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:29,120
He was nothing but her boyfriend.

147
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,290
He wasn't her boyfriend.

148
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,830
Does that matter to you right now?

149
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:37,930
Yes, it does.

150
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:41,480
Forget it.

151
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,370
We're here.

152
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,130
You have time, right?

153
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:06,510
Come up and have a drink.

154
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:11,860
- Yu Mi, I... 
 - What?

155
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:14,530
Am I not like Kang Na Eon today?

156
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:19,330
I might as well go see her.

157
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:24,070
So I could resemble her more.

158
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,860
- The vital signs are good, right? 
 - Yes.

159
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,170
- Let's go, then. 
 - Okay.

160
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,970
Here we go.

161
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,900
Hold on for a moment.

162
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,060
Where are you going right now?

163
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,810
Who are you?

164
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,360
I'm Kang Na Eon's guardian.

165
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:15,620
The director said we can't continue to help her.

166
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,790
The hospital bills haven't been paid.

167
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:26,720
To the VIP room. Make sure it's the best one.

168
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,480
Okay.

169
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,380
It's maxed out.

170
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,420
Six months installment payment.

171
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,130
It's not going through.

172
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,310
Twelve months, then?

173
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,410
 Emergency. Emergency. 

174
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:22,430
 Team Leader Do Yu Mi summoned us for a company meeting. 

175
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,560
 I'll be on vacation. 

176
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:27,380
 I think I'm kind of sick. 

177
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,180
Losers.

178
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,470
   

179
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,210
Why do I have to be in this body...

180
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,130
     

181
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,630
- This is princess-like.
- Don't even think about it.

182
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:07,050
I want the pink one.

183
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,350
It's nice to get together like this, isn't it?

184
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,110
Yes, Ma'am!

185
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,930
Should the Underdog Team start the presentation?

186
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,130
- Pardon? 
 - Gosh, what do we do?

187
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,080
What the hell...

188
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,570
What are you doing? Stop shaking.

189
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,110
I'll start the presentation for the strategy to upgrade...

190
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,640
the image of the handmade shoes...

191
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,960
Did you decide on a model?

192
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,930
We need a top celebrity since the theme is "luxury."

193
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,520
Yes. We're making calls while working on the list.

194
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,550
But for some reason...

195
00:14:57,550 --> 00:15:01,590
everyone said no by saying the same thing.

196
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:06,250
Did someone sabotage us or something?

197
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,430
It's probably because your proposal sucked.

198
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,270
How about the visuals?

199
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,480
Yes... Yes.

200
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,540
I came up with the visuals myself.

201
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,730
   

202
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,470
This is the first mockup.

203
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:48,580
It's a luxury rebranding for our top audience.

204
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,660
   

205
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,510
"Turn the handmade shoes no one wears

206
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,890
into the handmade shoes not just anyone can wear."

207
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,760
Redo it.

208
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,800
Why? Do you not like it?

209
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,090
No. I don't.

210
00:16:04,090 --> 00:16:05,900
What do you think?

211
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,020
Is it because Rex worked on it?

212
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:11,560
Well, the colors aren't quite...

213
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,860
How strange.

214
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,790
We hired a vendor that Team Leader Do worked with often.

215
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,660
Aren't they pretty good, Art Team Leader?

216
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:27,570
We do work with them when we need extra hands.

217
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,810
This is how scary framing is.

218
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:40,880
By the way Mr. So...

219
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:45,020
you don't think you're Kang Na Eon do you?

220
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:51,540
Why are we bringing her up right now?

221
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,730
It's because you're acting just like her.

222
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,650
You prepared this by yourself because you couldn't trust your teammates.

223
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:01,730
You just joined the team.

224
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,360
But you know what?

225
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,650
No one cares, even if you're unconscious for a month or if you start acting like her.

226
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:14,850
As if everyone wanted you to end up that way.

227
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,290
He'd better stop now.

228
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,000
Gosh, what do we do?

229
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:56,340
That's enough.

230
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,250
Let's stop now.

231
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:06,030
My team wants to go enjoy lunch.

232
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:15,250
Let's stop now. Thank you.

233
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,930
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

234
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,460
Thank you.

235
00:18:40,610 --> 00:18:42,350
Let's go.

236
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,750
- Let's get him something tasty. 
 - Yes.

237
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,360
Tasty food makes you feel better.

238
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:56,000
You make mistakes when you're new because you're too passionate.

239
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,820
I even yelled at the CEO's office in my first year.

240
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,950
"Let us eat twice at the company cafeteria!"

241
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:12,990
Sweetie, I don't like how you interrupted me and took over during the meeting,

242
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,690
but since you're handsome,

243
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,940
I'll forgive you if you get me two servings of food.

244
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,840
Did you hear that?

245
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,950
- Something tasty. Something tasty. 
 - Let's see...

246
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,920
Did you contact Actor Park's management company?

247
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,000
Yes, I'm waiting for them to call back.

248
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,270
- Get an extra large one. Extra large. 
 - Then we should start with the redesign—

249
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,830
Gosh, you're moving too fast honey.

250
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:33,120
We can finish by the weekly meeting next week.

251
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,410
They're having a review event.

252
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:37,260
What would you like, Oppa?

253
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:44,890
Do you... want to live as losers here forever?

254
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,470
What?

255
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:49,400
Honey, you're being too harsh.

256
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,840
- How dare you call us losers? 
 - Don't.

257
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,770
- Let me correct myself. 
 - Yes, go ahead and do that!

258
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,430
I said "framing" in the conference room earlier.

259
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:03,670
But you weren't framed.

260
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:07,240
You guys are actually losers.

261
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,160
You've got to be kidding me.

262
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:11,240
Excuse me.

263
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,260
You're the one who ignored all the current projects and made us do the rebranding.

264
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:20,450
You're the outcast and loser on this team, okay?

265
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,820
- Stop it, Rex. 
 - Geez.

266
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:27,500
Do you not need to work hard since you have two jobs?

267
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,450
- What do you mean- 
 - You have a male body,

268
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,550
but the soul of a goddess?

269
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,290
Shit.

270
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:41,070
Princess!

271
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:44,240
Oppa, you don't have friends, right?

272
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:07,580
We'll get going now.

273
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,860
Thank you so much.

274
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,870
Aren't you going home Team Leader?

275
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,710
I need to stop by the hospital.

276
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,320
You can go ahead.

277
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,980
- Let's go. 
 - Take care.

278
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,700
Why is he going to the hospital?

279
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,250
- He's going to see her. 
 - Her?

280
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:24,060
   

281
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:43,210
   

282
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,220
Yes.

283
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,480
Did the actor actually turn us down first?

284
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,100
Yes, got it.

285
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:13,970
 I hope you apologize sincerely for what you said today. 

286
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:17,160
 Otherwise, I'm going to take a stand against you. 

287
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,720
I wish I could be the one taking a stand.

288
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,790
I mean...

289
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:36,500
how could we switch back?

290
00:22:55,330 --> 00:22:57,870
No way.

291
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,650
What...

292
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,590
are you doing right now?

293
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:03,900


294
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:06,360
♫  Just call me Lady  ♫

295
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,290
   

296
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:10,420
♫  Don't call me "Of Yours"  ♫

297
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,620
♫  I just may achieve my dream, get up  ♫

298
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:17,910
♫  I'm driven by pain, even in the face of challenge and despair  ♫

299
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:20,530
♫  There is no need to stress  ♫

300
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:23,730
♫  That's my blue  ♫

301
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:31,830
♫  Just call me "Lady", don't call me "Of Yours"  ♫

302
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:39,920
♫  Just call me "Lady", don't call me "Of Yours"  ♫

303
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:43,370
♫  Pointy flat shoes  ♫

304
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,000
♫  Worn-out sneakers  ♫

305
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:52,210
♫  Whatever it is, I feel like I can touch the sky  ♫
