1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:07,210
   

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:10,350
What are you doing?

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,650
Shit.

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,740
Isn't this the only way to that we know of to switch back to ourselves?

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:21,080
Don't push it.

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,580
You're the absolute worst.

7
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,610
Shit.

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:36,680
Their souls switched bodies?

9
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,880
   

10
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,580
   

11
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,370
   

12
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:49,770
   

13
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,120
  

14
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:09,370
   

15
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:18,870


16
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:26,660
 I'll tell you what you want to know under one condition.  
    

17
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,720
 If what So Eun Ho wants from Director Han 

18
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,220
 is the evidence from the incident five years ago... 

19
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,200
 Director Han. 

20
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,550
 You're talking as if you actually have the weapon to kill me. 

21
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:48,030
 Of course, I do. 

22
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,480
 I've had it for the past five years. 

23
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,200
 What exactly does he have? 

24
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,920
   

25
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,880
   

26
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,410
   

27
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:09,850
- Hello, Director. 
 - Hello, Director.

28
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,540
Good morning.

29
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:15,160
Hey, Team Leader So. You came in early?

30
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,110
How does it feel to become a team leader?

31
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,420
Isn't it thrilling?

32
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,160
I heard about what happened yesterday.

33
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:26,280
I wanted to destroy Kang Na Eon publicly,

34
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,750
but competing presentations aren't a bad idea.

35
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:35,120
Obliterate her into nothing for the whole world to see.

36
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,220
Why do you hate Kang Na Eon so much?

37
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:47,030
Do you need a reason to hate someone?

38
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,070
If I defeat Kang Na Eon,

39
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,340
will you give me what I want?

40
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,740
Have you only been lied to by other people?

41
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,400
You've already seen the physical evidence.

42
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,940
You won't have any team members for now.

43
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:15,910
I'll give you a budget, so hire subcontractors.

44
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,220
 There's physical evidence from the case five years ago? 

45
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,400
Yes.

46
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,810
You're going to have to help me.

47
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,710
So, you want us to help you do marketing for Segye Group?

48
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:53,850
Yes. I don't have any team members.

49
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,860
Well, we have our own teams and duties.

50
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:01,640
I know you're supposed to love your colleagues, but still...

51
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,650
Soo Dong you're probably not busy since Team 2 didn't receive a project.

52
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:09,280
Hyung, but I still have stuff to do.

53
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,440
You did what Team Leader Kang told you to do.

54
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:14,570
- And this isn't your first time at Segye Group— 
 - Hey.

55
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,170
What are you saying...

56
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:19,150
Hey, have you been here before?

57
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:23,220
Wool Soop, I'll ask Cha Jeong Woo to let you take a break. Don't worry.

58
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,930
Cha Jeong Woo?

59
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:29,080
Oppa, are you buddies with our team leader, too?

60
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,160
Hyung—

61
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,970
Hang up, hang up.

62
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,380
This isn't right.

63
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,290
Yes. Jeong Woo Sunbae, it's me.

64
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,830
So Eun Ho?

65
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,750
What's with you?

66
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,770
What are you doing to Na Eon at Segye Group—

67
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,530
Let me borrow your new team member, Seo Wool Soop.

68
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,420
Oppa...

69
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,070
Did you lose your mind or something?

70
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,350
   

71
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,570
 Director Han. 

72
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:14,450
 I'll have to help you until I acquire the evidence. 

73
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,750
- So heavy. 
 - Gosh, hello.

74
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,410
- Geez. 
 - It's so heavy.

75
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,930
What brings you up here?

76
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:33,070
I heard you threw a tantrum, saying you wanted the HQ Motors project yourself.

77
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,730
- But we know it won't be easy to do alone. 
 - That's why we're...

78
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,500
 Here to help you! 

79
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,620
We might as well share the office.

80
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,070
Your personal office is a lot bigger than the  Underdog office.

81
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:48,230
I plan to cut some corners with the HQ Motors project.

82
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:51,870
Okay, first of all,

83
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:54,500
I'll look up academic papers to determine a marketing strategy.

84
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,870
I'll do some sketches for the design.

85
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,270
I'll have to stay up all night.

86
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,780
Then I'll...

87
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:04,530
take selfies?

88
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:12,220
Jenny, you can find social media marketing examples for new technologies.

89
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:15,230
That's my specialty.

90
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,970
See? Don't you feel a lot better with us here?

91
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,550
I'm letting you stay since you won't leave even if I kick you out.

92
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:28,110
Gosh. We get it. You're Kang Na Eon. You don't know how to talk pleasantly.

93
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,200
It would have been perfect if Eun Ho oppa were here.

94
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,000
I know. Team Leader Kang, you probably don't know.

95
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,750
Team Leader So isn't just sweet, he's good at his job too.

96
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:41,010
Not only that, he's empathetic.

97
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,260
I know. Look what he did with Daeseongjang.

98
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:47,300
"I won't change anything."

99
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,560
The grandma and the granddaughter started wailing.

100
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,390
But what difference does it make?

101
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,540
I heard he joined Segye Group's marketing team.

102
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,400
That's what I'm saying!

103
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:00,880
That makes him our enemy now.

104
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,820
We're on Seongsu Agency's Team Leader Kang's side now.

105
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,340
- Okay. Let's. 
 - Get.

106
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,050
- It. 
  - Here... 

107
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:10,720
Let's...

108
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,990
create the presentation for now.

109
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,280
Hello?

110
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,960
Team Leader Nam, let's talk for a second.

111
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,510
I'm busy.

112
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:37,250
I think... I discovered an unbelievable secret about Kang Na Eon and So Eun Ho.

113
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,940
What exactly is So Eun Ho and Kang Na Eon's secret?

114
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,440
Kang Na Eon and So Eun Ho.

115
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,740
I think their bodies were swapped.

116
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,670
Their bodies were swapped?

117
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,910
You've watched too many dramas and movies don't you think?

118
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:12,930
How does that make any sense?

119
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:18,430
I know it sounds foolish.

120
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,430
That's why I asked you to come here.

121
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:27,550
Go find out...

122
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,360
if their bodies were actually switched.

123
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,630
I see...

124
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,970
How am I supposed to find that out?

125
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:40,480
By chance, by a very slim chance, say their bodies actually switched.

126
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,000
What difference does it make?

127
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,740
By chance, by a very slim chance, if their bodies actually switched,

128
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:49,890
Kang Na Eon isn't Kang Na Eon. But the incompetent newbie So Eun Ho.

129
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:53,830
We could destroy her if we just rattled her a little.

130
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,540
Exactly.

131
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:05,240
 Please look specifically for this. 

132
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,960
 A liquid hydrogen battery was invented by... 

133
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,490
 HQ Motors. 

134
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,260
So, that's So Eun Ho, huh?

135
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,960
 Right. The HQ Motors— 

136
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,340
Wow...

137
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:29,680
You know, the weather's nice. We should attend a group workshop instead of working all the time.

138
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,180
It was nice when we went last year.

139
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:33,730
Sure, whatever.

140
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,060
Yup.

141
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,740
Okay.

142
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:40,230
We're going, then. I'll schedule it.

143
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,050
- Carry on. 
 - Yes, see you.

144
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,890
Let's refocus.

145
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:50,070
What workshop? She's the only one who didn't go last year.

146
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,410
How could she not remember that?

147
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,260
Was that really So Eun Ho?

148
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,030
   

149
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,150
I know this is the first liquid hydrogen battery in Korea,

150
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:05,140
but all automobile marketing is the same.

151
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,800
Right.

152
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,940
Whether it's a battery or a new car,

153
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:13,600
you just need a handsome actor to drive it like this.

154
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,700
- I know. 
 - By the way,

155
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:18,490
I think I've found something.

156
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,040
It's a small company,

157
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,970
but I think we could use it as a reference.

158
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:26,610
Park Jenny did it again, didn't she?

159
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,070
It's not too bad.

160
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,750
   

161
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,870
By the way, this sounds very similar to the liquid hydrogen battery technology

162
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,950
that HQ Motors supposedly invented in Korea first.

163
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:39,490
You're right.

164
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:43,350
Didn't they say theirs was the first Korean commercial liquid hydrogen battery?

165
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,870
This is so weird.

166
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:48,280
If HQ Motors is making such a big deal about being the first in the country,

167
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,710
shouldn't that company have made it big by now?

168
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:53,190
Right. It should've totally blown up.

169
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,480
Let's visit their office.

170
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,370
Tonight?

171
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,250
It looks haunted.

172
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,450
Haunted Hotel Part Two?

173
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:06,000
I know. Looks like they went out of business.

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,310
Should we just leave?

175
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,600
Let's go in first.

176
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,100
L-Let's go.

177
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:15,330
- Let's go. 
 - You go first. Hurry.

178
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:21,140
What's with this car?

179
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,590
W-Walk faster Rex.

180
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:27,340
Gosh, I'm scared too.

181
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,520
I-Is something there? L-Look over there...

182
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,170
   

183
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,270
Are you by chance employees of High Jet?

184
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,360
Isn't that Eun Ho?

185
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,440
♫  It's over, baby  ♫

186
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,670
That's an amazing suit.

187
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:07,150
I think he got even sexier since joining Segye Group.

188
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,970
They really must have something to do with HQ Motors since Eun Ho oppa was here, right?

189
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,890
Let's go.

190
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,200
   

191
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,170
President Choi Chang Ju?

192
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:37,000
Hello, we're from Seongsu Agency's marketing team—

193
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,140
Hydrogen's calorie level is three times higher than that of an internal combustion engine.

194
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:44,120
The sedans used in most households

195
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,490
get 100 km (~62 miles) in mileage per 1 kilowatt.

196
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:51,060
A 6 to 7kg fuel tank is sufficient.

197
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:58,090
The criticism that hydrogen vehicles are more dangerous than natural gas vehicles is incorrect.

198
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:02,610
Hydrogen storage technology has been used in various industries for over 100 years.

199
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,740
Everything HQ Motors said is correct.

200
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:09,300
Liquid hydrogen is more stable than gaseous hydrogen.

201
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,180
If a lot of people use liquid hydrogen,

202
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,680
the liquid hydrogen vehicle market can grow larger.

203
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,250
That's why I like big companies.

204
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:18,580
I don't like High Jet because it's small.

205
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,710
Gosh, who told you that?

206
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,160
The handsome hyung did.

207
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,150
The handsome hyung?

208
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,350
So Eun Ho?

209
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:29,510
A car this big...

210
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:33,830
can drive for 100 km if it had a liquid hydrogen battery this big.

211
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,920
That's how great a liquid hydrogen battery is.

212
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,480
If you just sit still,

213
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,660
we'll take care of everything...

214
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,640
for you.

215
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,580
He said they'd handle everything if I just sat still.

216
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:28,390
 Kang Na Eon, will you keep doing this? 

217
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:40,060
 This is the HQ Motors task force chatroom. 

218
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:42,570
 By the way, what are we doing? 

219
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:47,670
 They're definitely stealing the small company's technology. 

220
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:49,560
 It's not our place to step in, 

221
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,870
 but we can't just ignore it either. 

222
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:57,030
 How about we just quit now? 

223
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,150
 I won't let the same thing happen again. 

224
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,500
 I'll stop it. 

225
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,230
 What? What did you say? 

226
00:15:11,230 --> 00:15:15,650
You'll do a presentation on High Jet in front of HQ Motors?

227
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:19,150
Yes. I need to let people know that it's High Jet's technology.

228
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:23,150
Is it necessary to do that at HQ Motors' office?

229
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,410
We might as well not do a presentation at all.

230
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,310
That's exactly what I'm saying.

231
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:30,450
We'll get annihilated if we do that, Team Leader.

232
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:33,730
I'm sure many people at HQ don't know about this.

233
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,860
They'll change once they realize it.

234
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:38,530
I don't know what Eun Ho said,

235
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:42,690
but even High Jet's president said they didn't steal anything. Is there any point in speaking up?

236
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,020
The truth is what's important.

237
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,230
We can't just play ignorant when we know it's wrong.

238
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:52,500
You don't have to do anything yourselves.

239
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,970
I'll do it alone if necessary.

240
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,580
What do we do...

241
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:07,000
 Can we actually do a presentation for High Jet? 

242
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,160
 Gosh, of course not. 

243
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,280
 Gosh, my head. My head hurts. 

244
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,160
 By the way, why does she suddenly care about being fair? 

245
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,630
 I wonder what Eun Ho is up to right now. 

246
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:25,190
 He told the president of High Jet that he would take care of everything. 

247
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:28,120
 He must have had a plan, right? 

248
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:31,220
 Should we go check, then? 

249
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,960
   

250
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:46,230
See? I said no one would be here during lunch break.

251
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,750
Yes, you're the best.

252
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,590
Let's go.

253
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,320
They left. They left.

254
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,980
The marketing team. The marketing team.

255
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,890
Let's go.

256
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,570
   

257
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:10,260
Gosh, Eun Ho Honey works alone without teammates.

258
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,380
It makes me sad.

259
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,620
How does that make sense?

260
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,950
Was Eun Ho oppa always this neat?

261
00:17:17,450 --> 00:17:18,870
- It's up. It's up. 
 - There it is.

262
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:20,370
Over there. Over there.

263
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:21,840
Wait a minute.

264
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,040
It's done. Wait a minute.

265
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,760
Hurry! Hurry!

266
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,960
Hurry!

267
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:38,000
Shit!

268
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,260
Gosh, my earring.

269
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,600
   

270
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,400
He knows they stole High Jet's technology, but he's still moving forward.

271
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,150
I didn't think Eun Ho Honey would do this. He's such a bad guy.

272
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:13,210
I can't support him on this.

273
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:17,610
What can we do then? There's nothing we can do.

274
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:21,340
I appreciate you helping me so far,

275
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,840
but I'll do this alone from now on.

276
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,990
All of a sudden?

277
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,930
Yes.

278
00:18:27,930 --> 00:18:31,460
Things will get messy once the truth comes out.

279
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:36,430
We'll get criticized, insulted and accused of lying.

280
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,970
I don't want to...

281
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,880
use you for something like that.

282
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,160
But still—

283
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,580
I'm not asking you. It's an order.

284
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,740
Let's stop.

285
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:15,830
♫  Can you see it from afar?  ♫

286

 Risk. 

295
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,460
 The damage from failure. 

296
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:58,180
 Always keep them in mind when doing marketing.

 Vegan beauty brand reputation damaged. 

302

 How should I manage the backlash?

♫  And shine here  ♫

313
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,920
 Hyung, Director Han's passcode is 6457. 

314
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,670
Yes, but it's too far away.

315
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:40,830
It's too far.

316
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:43,150
Really? I...

317
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:44,830
Again.

318
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:46,980
Again?

319
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,240
Is it six?

320
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,320
- Isn't it eight? 
 - It's not eight.

321
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,620
He went straight down.

322
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,070
Hey, hide!

323
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,760
   

324
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:52,680
 What Director Han had... 

325
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,010
 was this external hard drive? 

326
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:34,410
 How did you end up with this? 

327
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,560
   

328
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,060
   

329
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,720
Team Leader Kang.

330
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,540
I mean, So Eun Ho.

331
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:06,750
I'm so sorry.

332
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:09,190
I mean it.

333
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,750
   

334
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,870
   

335
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,440
Why are you back here?

336
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,640
Team Leader.

337
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,470
Why did you reformat this?

338
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:45,720
Weren't you making a presentation for High Jet?

339
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,400
We're screwed.

340
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,390
Gosh, I got the chills.

341
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,250
Where are you going alone now?

342
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,720
Aren't we in this together?

343
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,670
We should resolve things together.

344
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:05,130
 We're a team! 

345
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:20,410
Okay. Then let's go get President Choi Chang Ju together.

346
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,830
- Yup. 
 - Let's go.

347
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:29,250
That fellow, So Eun Ho or whoever. He'll do okay, right?

348
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,980
If it goes wrong, you and I—

349
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,480
Don't worry so much.

350
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:37,340
No one's more obsessed with Kang Na Eon than So Eun Ho.

351
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:41,950
And... I'm sure HQ did a good job too.

352
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,970
Did you leave evidence by any chance?

353
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:54,190
Gosh, Hyungnim. Why would we?

354
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:59,610
There's no evidence left that High Jet invented a liquid hydrogen battery.

355
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:03,130
We confiscated and destroyed everything.

356
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,090
- Isn't that Eun Ho? 
 - Eun Ho oppa?

357
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:19,070
Wasn't President Chang Ju in there too?

358
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:22,500
He looked so handsome even in that short moment.

359
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,740
Let's go see it in person.

360
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:29,320
I'm very curious about what expression Kang Na Eon will make.

361
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,920
I'll make sure you see it.

362
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,550
By the way, w-where are we going?

363
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,880
We'll be there soon.

364
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:57,280


365
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:02,170
   

366
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:09,110
♫  Walk steadily just like as Rocky  ♫

367
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,700
♫  The windy road doesn't affect me at all  ♫

368
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:15,560
♫  I don't even flinch, I was born to be a warrior  ♫

369
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:19,310
♫  You've seen it at least once  ♫

370
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,810
♫  Like a protagonist who comes back to life, so I...  ♫

371
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:26,680
♫  He feels dizzy, but he gets up  ♫

372
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:33,660
♫  You say this is enough and what's pleasant is better  ♫

373
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,790
♫  Burn it, throw everything, like a fire  ♫

374
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,960
♫  I'm breaking rocks  ♫

375
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:46,320
♫  I'm breaking rocks  ♫
