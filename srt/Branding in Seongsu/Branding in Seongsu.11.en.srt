00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,690
Ms. Kang's pop-up store rent has been canceled.

7
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:20,889
Our jewelry store's construction...

8
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,061
is going smoothly.

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:25,890
What about the art? Did you make sure to get rid of it?

10
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,430
Yes. All of it has been deleted.

11
00:00:28,761 --> 00:00:29,801
Great work.

12
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,171
I should visit the jewelry pop-up store.

13
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:37,940
I'm getting curious which place Kang Na Eon chose.

14
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:41,381
She doesn't really have good taste in things.

15
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:50,619
- What? It was this place? - Oh, hello.

16
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,620
Hello.

17
00:00:53,051 --> 00:00:55,190
We used this place often.

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,520
It just doesn't have quite a high floating population.

19
00:00:57,521 --> 00:00:59,530
There's usually a lot of people around.

20
00:00:59,531 --> 00:01:01,860
But a pop-up store opened over there.

21
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,200
- A pop-up store? - Yes.

22
00:01:03,801 --> 00:01:06,300
- Isn't it that one? - That must be Ms. Kang's store.

23
00:01:06,301 --> 00:01:07,330
I think it is that one.

24
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:08,741
- Let's go. - Let's hurry.

25
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,110
- Where is it? - Isn't it over there?

26
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:14,779
- That one? - Is it?

27
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,810
Let's go.

29
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:21,779
Oh, hello!

30
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,149
There are so many people.

31
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:24,851
So this is where it is.

32
00:01:25,191 --> 00:01:26,450
It looks nice.

33
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:28,119

35
00:01:34,831 --> 00:01:36,330

00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:47,240
Welcome.

41
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:48,710
- All right! - You want three?

42
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:50,080
Hello.

51
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,940
Thank you.

52
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:21,481
I'll go.

00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:25,111

57
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,130
You must have been doing a lot of thinking.

58
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,599
Thanks to you.

59
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,300
There are a lot of people.

60
00:03:24,301 --> 00:03:25,410
But...

61
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,980
with a place like this with this sort of art,

62
00:03:30,981 --> 00:03:33,380
the rent and design fees...

63
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,120
would cost you some money.

64
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:37,250
Do you think you can handle it?

65
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,990
You wouldn't have had the time for an estimate sheet.

66
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:43,660
Don't break into tears after checking the balance accounts.

67
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,430
Oh, no!

68
00:03:48,231 --> 00:03:50,499
You didn't know that the budgets for Team One and Underdog...

69
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,600
were different, didn't you?

70
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,100
Gosh.

71
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,271
You should've told me earlier.

72
00:03:57,741 --> 00:03:58,771
Sorry.

73
00:04:01,611 --> 00:04:03,541
Had we known we had a budget,

74
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,250
we could've spent some money.

75
00:04:08,421 --> 00:04:09,421
What?

76
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,490
What do we do?

77
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,560
The owner of the building is on vacation.

78
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:24,631
It'll be hard to contact the owner.

79
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,071
What do we do?

80
00:04:27,771 --> 00:04:29,840
But it really is a small world.

81
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:31,940
You know the owner of the pharmacy that ran out of business, right?

82
00:04:31,941 --> 00:04:34,810
She's the wife of the doctor who took care of The Five Eagles.

83
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:37,539
How is it such a small world?

84
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,409
How can this happen?

85
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:40,779
- Isn't it amazing? - Young Ae?

86
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,219
- I was so surprised. - We don't have time for this.

87
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,451
Wait! Young Ae.

88
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:50,359
Do you think we'll be able to use this fascinating connection?

89
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,589
I'm getting goosebumps.

90
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,360
I didn't even think about that.

91
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:55,399
You're the best!

92
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,229
I'm an expert at persuading people. Wait for just a moment.

93
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,230
Okay!

94
00:04:59,771 --> 00:05:00,831
I'll make a call right away.

95
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,170
Don't get your hopes up too high.

96
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,980
Why not?

97
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,340
Who knows if Young Ae will score big for us?

98
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,410
Gosh.

99
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,489
They're closed.

100
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,360
But they still have a month of rent left.

101
00:05:21,461 --> 00:05:23,260
We can use it for free!

102
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:25,989
I told you! We did it!

103
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,830
I told you!

104
00:05:27,831 --> 00:05:28,831
My gosh!

105
00:05:28,832 --> 00:05:30,461
My goodness.

106
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,299
Jenny, take this.

107
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,800
Me? Hey, Lex!

108
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,311
A princess can't be doing this.

109
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,371
You're making it all dusty.

110
00:05:41,211 --> 00:05:42,311
Come on.

111
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:49,649
Right. Up, Jenny.

112
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,390
Lift it higher, Jenny.

113
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:53,489
It's slippery and heavy!

114
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,920
It's heavy for me too. Hurry up!

115
00:05:57,321 --> 00:05:58,360
Done!

116
00:05:58,631 --> 00:06:03,501
Gosh, our Nana is beautiful.

117
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:05,230
It's a work of art.

118
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:08,641
We don't have time.

119
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,840
It would've been way easier with the art team design.

120
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,609
What's the point of working my socks off?

121
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,811
It'll just be gone in a flash.

122
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:16,909
What am I supposed to do now?

123
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:20,480
Where do I even start?

124
00:06:21,251 --> 00:06:22,321
This is so annoying.

125
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:28,321
Going this far...

126
00:06:28,761 --> 00:06:30,461
Everyone calls it stalking.

127
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:34,331
The art designed by my team...

128
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,561
can be saved or deleted...

129
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:38,729
under my right.

130
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,701
- May I see your computer? - Why?

131
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,370
Get rid of everything you've worked on.

132
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:44,399
No!

133
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,469
What are you talking about?

134
00:06:45,470 --> 00:06:47,539
- No! - Why should we do that?

135
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,409
- No! - Get rid of it!

136
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,881
- No! - Stop!

137
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,581
What are you doing?

138
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:04,321
This is what you call being sincere.

139
00:07:05,061 --> 00:07:06,590
Then hand it to her yourself...

140
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,431
to Ms. Kang.

141
00:07:09,761 --> 00:07:11,230
Doing that...

142
00:07:12,371 --> 00:07:13,431
would make it an obsession.

143
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:34,150
Lex.

144
00:07:35,761 --> 00:07:36,821
Gosh.

145
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,160
- What is this? - It's safe.

146
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:40,891
Our design.

147
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,400
Oh, honey! I love you!

148
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,540
- Stop! - My gosh!

149
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:54,910
My face!

150
00:07:57,110 --> 00:07:58,850
- Hold on. - Stay still.

151
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:02,581
Darn it.

152
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,150
- Are you done? - Yes.

153
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:18,131
Oh, well.

154
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:22,141
We'll use the leftover budget for the next project.

155
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:26,410
We'll work well with the art team as well.

156
00:08:32,781 --> 00:08:34,581
Like I care.

157
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:37,551
- Goodness. - Ms. Do!

158
00:08:37,552 --> 00:08:39,720
- Ms. Do! - Ms. Do! Where are you doing?

159
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:41,720
- Ms. Do! - Ms. Do!

160
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:45,160
I can leave on my own. Don't follow me.

161
00:08:45,161 --> 00:08:47,290
- Do Yoo Mi. - Just tell us where you're going.

162
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,931
She must've felt very disturbed this time.

163
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:51,031
I told you not to follow me!

164
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:53,900
Hey, that must be it.

165
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:56,099
That's the pop-up store she came up with after returning.

166
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,940
She sure is different.

167
00:08:57,941 --> 00:08:59,411
Darn it.

168
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:03,340
I think so too.

169
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,620
But I wonder.

170
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,020
Who's behind Ms. Do's back?

171
00:09:13,191 --> 00:09:15,759
We'll be able to find out today.

172
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,161
The number is...

173
00:09:18,831 --> 00:09:20,130
I need to see you right now.

174
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,260
Get home right away after everything is done.

175
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,801
What?

176
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,070
Hey!

177
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:30,540
Is this the pop-up store?

178
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,109
Yes. It's right here.

179
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,270
Come this way.

180
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,630
(Reserved)

181
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,291
Excuse me.

182
00:09:57,331 --> 00:09:59,171
Please follow that car. We need to hurry.

183
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:06,211
Darn it!

184
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,711
I knew it, Do Yoo Mi.

185
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:42,941
I told you to take care of Kang Na Eon before...

186
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:48,651
Why are you here?

187
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,380
What's wrong?

188
00:10:50,921 --> 00:10:52,120
Am I not allowed to be here?

189
00:10:54,191 --> 00:10:56,321
I don't have time for games.

190
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,431
Open it.

191
00:11:02,461 --> 00:11:03,661
I told you to open it!

192
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,831
I'm not playing games.

193
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,100
Get off me.

194
00:11:11,201 --> 00:11:12,969
I've given it some thought.

195
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,581
I'm suspecting if our Yoo Mi pushed Ms. Kang Na Eon...

196
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,651
from behind just like that.

197
00:11:21,311 --> 00:11:23,151
What is it that you want to say?

198
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:29,620
To say I saw everything.

199
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:45,470
(Team Manager Kang Na Eon)

200
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:55,051
(The mail has been successfully sent.)

201
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:16,739
After the XU incident...

202
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,811
and Kang Na Eon ending up like that,

203
00:12:19,311 --> 00:12:23,380
our Yoo Mi happened to become the team manager.

204
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,051
So you tried to kill Kang Na Eon.

205
00:12:32,191 --> 00:12:33,750
Isn't that a pretty accurate guess?

206
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,260
Yoo Mi.

207
00:12:39,691 --> 00:12:42,331
Just like the person you treat who takes care of your back,

208
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,701
treat me just the same.

209
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,620
What?

210
00:13:03,321 --> 00:13:04,350
What's going on?

211
00:13:06,421 --> 00:13:09,561
Hey, stop! Our lips didn't touch yet!

212
00:13:13,661 --> 00:13:14,730
Mr. Nam?

213
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:21,901
We have a fly in our way.

214
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,151
What?

215
00:13:38,791 --> 00:13:40,051
Why are you here?

216
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:43,161
First, let's get out of here.

217
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:44,590
Get your hands off me!

218
00:13:45,230 --> 00:13:48,160
I don't need any help from anyone related to Kang Na Eon!

219
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,301
Get yourself together.

220
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,431
Calm down.

221
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:55,240
Why?

222
00:13:56,671 --> 00:13:58,340
Are you here to threaten me too?

223
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:00,911
Did Kang Na Eon make you do it?

224
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,440
Do you want to tell me I tried to kill her to take her place?

225
00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:04,510
Are you here to say that?

226
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,750
I came because I got worried.

227
00:14:08,311 --> 00:14:09,321
What?

228
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:11,220
Earlier,

229
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:14,291
when you talked with Ms. Kang,

230
00:14:15,661 --> 00:14:17,490
you looked anxious and troubled.

231
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,590
That was why I followed you.

232
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:22,730
What do you know about me?

233
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,531
I also have been...

234
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,931
used by Ms. Kang.

235
00:14:31,301 --> 00:14:32,411
I know how you feel...

236
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,671
more than anyone else.

237
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,651
It wasn't me.

238
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,051
It really wasn't me.

239
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,120
I'm serious.

240
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,791
It wasn't me.

241
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,661
I didn't expect things to end up like this.

242
00:14:57,901 --> 00:14:59,571
- I'm telling you! - It's okay.

243
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:03,370
None of it...

244
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,470
is your fault.

245
00:15:07,671 --> 00:15:10,411
I just hated Na Eon so much.

246
00:15:13,951 --> 00:15:15,850
I just reported it. That's all.

247
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,749
Flawsome marketing.

248
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:21,821
A marketing strategy that honestly draws out the flaw or weakness...

249
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,130
of the current trend and attracts sympathy and a sense of connection.

250
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,730
People work just the same.

251
00:15:29,701 --> 00:15:32,401
If they feel a sense of connection with their weaknesses,

252
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:36,701
it unlocks the way to their heart.

253
00:15:42,781 --> 00:15:43,911
If it wasn't you,

254
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,181
who did that to Kang Na Eon?

255
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,681
You know,

256
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:53,821
don't you?

257
00:15:58,691 --> 00:15:59,791
What's with you?

258
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,561
You said you weren't on Kang Na Eon's side.

259
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,061
But why do you want to know the culprit of that incident?

260
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,600
I have to have the thing she wants the most.

261
00:16:08,171 --> 00:16:09,870
Only then, I can win against her.

262
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,311
How do I trust you?

263
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:14,711
Right in front of your eyes,

264
00:16:16,181 --> 00:16:19,411
I came here to save you.

265
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:25,151
If you can't trust me,

266
00:16:26,691 --> 00:16:28,350
I'll take care of them one by one.

267
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,390
Whether it be Ms. Kang or Mr. Nam.

268
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,130
I'll get rid of anyone who gives you a hard time.

269
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:40,901
Is there...

270
00:16:41,571 --> 00:16:42,701
anyone else?

271
00:16:47,941 --> 00:16:49,340
You just wait, Do Yoo Mi.

272
00:16:50,411 --> 00:16:52,110
When tomorrow morning comes,

273
00:16:52,151 --> 00:16:54,411
everyone in the office will get a look at this.

274
00:16:56,951 --> 00:16:57,951
What?

275
00:16:58,791 --> 00:16:59,791
What's wrong with this?

276
00:17:00,451 --> 00:17:03,591
Why is it turned off?

277
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:09,760
Gosh. I saw them pressing something here.

278
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:14,371
Where could it be?

279
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:16,641
What?

280
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,970
Oh, gosh!

281
00:17:23,881 --> 00:17:26,250
You have to ask the management team for the screen.

282
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:31,451
Oh, you're the new guy.

283
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:39,131
What is it?

284
00:17:41,391 --> 00:17:42,500
Hey! What...

285
00:17:47,131 --> 00:17:49,900
What are you looking at?

286
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:51,370
Oh, gosh.

287
00:17:51,371 --> 00:17:52,809
You piece of trash.

288
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:54,270
Hey! That's...

289
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:57,040
(Album 1)

290
00:17:58,951 --> 00:18:00,410
Hey, what are you doing?

291
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:02,780
Why are you taking pictures?

292
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,790
Hey.

293
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,621
Now, you won't even be able to get a new job.

294
00:18:09,861 --> 00:18:10,891
Gosh.

295
00:18:12,431 --> 00:18:15,161
How dare you act like this to a superior?

296
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,100
Where are you going?

297
00:18:19,101 --> 00:18:20,101
The management team.

298
00:18:20,371 --> 00:18:21,901
Why you little...

299
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,641
A fight...

300
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:30,810
is won by the one who goes for the open spot.

301
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,780
Open spot?

302
00:18:34,851 --> 00:18:35,881
That's right.

303
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,461
Hey!

304
00:18:44,591 --> 00:18:45,661
Hey!

305
00:18:57,901 --> 00:18:58,970
So Eun Ho.

306
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,080
So Eun Ho.

307
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,091
So Eun Ho.

308
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,290
Wake up, Eun Ho.

309
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,861
So Eun Ho!

310
00:19:18,931 --> 00:19:19,961
So Eun Ho.

311
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:21,691
So Eun Ho!

312
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,800
So Eun Ho!

313
00:19:27,371 --> 00:19:28,500
- Darn it. - That hurts.

314
00:19:31,141 --> 00:19:32,240
That hurts.

315
00:19:34,570 --> 00:19:36,411
That hurts.

316
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,050
Why are you here?

317
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:42,851
Well, I just...

318
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,921
I got home,

319
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:52,560
but I heard a strange noise coming from the room.

320
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:14,911
I think I fainted after that.

321
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,720
Are there ghosts in this house?

322
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,391
You saw it too?

323
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,560
What?

324
00:20:24,161 --> 00:20:25,730
So it's real?

325
00:20:27,961 --> 00:20:29,661
Does that drop the price of the apartment?

326
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,601
But you.

327
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:39,611
Why were you in here?

328
00:20:39,941 --> 00:20:40,970
What?

329
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:44,540
Why were you in the dressing room?

330
00:20:47,550 --> 00:20:49,620
It was quite cold today.

331
00:20:49,621 --> 00:20:51,881
I just wanted to look for some outerwear.

332
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:53,520
Is that it?

333
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,720
Yes, that's it.

334
00:20:58,421 --> 00:21:00,891
Are you going to butt into everything I do?

335
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,861
Then I'll start butting in too.

336
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:05,030
Do as you please.

337
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,570
Okay.

338
00:21:11,441 --> 00:21:13,941
Were you with Yoo Mi all this time?

339
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,009
Why? What were you two doing until this hour?

340
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,479
Why meet her all of a sudden? What did you do with her?

341
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,711
Tell me about it!

342
00:21:18,911 --> 00:21:20,750
I seduced Do Yoo Mi.

343
00:21:20,881 --> 00:21:21,951
What?

344
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:23,851
You told me to tell you.

345
00:21:25,591 --> 00:21:26,720
Na Eon!

346
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:31,819
Who wouldn't fall for my handsome face and hot body?

347
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:36,529
Gosh! I've been doing so well to keep my hidden treasure safe.

348
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,861
Whatever, you hidden loser.

349
00:21:38,661 --> 00:21:39,829
Will you leave now?

350
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,499
- I'm exhausted. - Hold on.

351
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,800
What if Yoo Mi changes her profile picture to my photo?

352
00:21:47,371 --> 00:21:48,371
Did you sleep with her?

353
00:21:49,381 --> 00:21:50,441
Not yet.

354
00:21:51,141 --> 00:21:52,451
"Not yet?"

355
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,750
We'll be enemies for a while.

356
00:21:58,151 --> 00:21:59,750
I've sided with Do Yoo Mi starting from today.

357
00:22:00,451 --> 00:22:01,520
Then...

358
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,860
Gosh. Hold on.

359
00:22:03,861 --> 00:22:06,760
- What are you doing? - Get out!

360
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:16,070
Hey! You said she was an enemy!

361
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:20,310
Open up, will you? Hey!

362
00:22:21,171 --> 00:22:22,181
Come on.

363
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,411
Na Eon!

364
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,990
I'll take care of them one by one.

365
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,161
I'll get rid of anyone who gives you a hard time.

366
00:22:41,161 --> 00:22:42,230
Is there...

367
00:22:42,901 --> 00:22:44,030
anyone else?

368
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,371
I don't trust you.

369
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:53,270
An important project will come from the head office next week.

370
00:22:54,211 --> 00:22:56,080
Use that project to bring Kang Na Eon down.

371
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:57,711
Do you think you can do that?

372
00:22:58,951 --> 00:23:01,411

Do Yoo Mi knows what Hwang Je Ha is up to?

376
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:26,671
So...

377
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,540

I love this idea.

Get it done until the next meeting.

389

If you were going to copy it, at least, clean up the mess.

390
00:24:03,711 --> 00:24:05,239
Why make things go this far?

391
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:06,809
How will you take responsibility?

392
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:09,579
The responsibility of this case...

393
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,951
will be taken by the marketing director and myself.

I told you I would do anything for you.

Vice-chairman Hwang Sang Gook's only son.

414
00:25:57,421 --> 00:25:59,060
He's 31 years old.

415
00:25:59,161 --> 00:26:01,789
He studied in the US, and he was just 25...

416
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:05,259
when he became Segye International's director.

417
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:08,229
He launched a variety of domestic brands...

418
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,299
after benchmarking different high-end brands.

419
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,540
However,

420
00:26:11,841 --> 00:26:13,469
everything he got his hands on was a failure.

421
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:17,180
And five years ago, his aroma candle brand was a total flop.

422
00:26:17,181 --> 00:26:19,711
I failed! I failed once again!

423
00:26:19,881 --> 00:26:21,750
He was quiet for a while.

424
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:24,421
Last year, he got into alcohol.

425
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,951
So he launched Segye Soju.

426
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:30,489

436
00:26:53,711 --> 00:26:55,611
I'm feeling upset as you're pretending not to know me.

What?

443
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,540
You're asking me how I've been? That's funny.

444
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:23,010
Don't you know how many years I've suffered because of you?

445
00:27:25,441 --> 00:27:26,451
To be honest,

446
00:27:27,881 --> 00:27:29,280
I lost my memory after the accident.

447
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:31,050
In fact, I heard about it.

448
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,020
What a relief you're still alive.

449
00:27:34,691 --> 00:27:35,820
Had you died,

450
00:27:37,091 --> 00:27:38,790

which team would that be?

456
00:27:56,941 --> 00:27:59,111
Ms. Kang's team? Or...

457
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,809
Ms. Do's team?

458
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,019
Director Hwang, it would be best to give it to Team One...

459
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,421
Why don't you give it to both teams...

460
00:28:05,121 --> 00:28:06,391
and choose the best presentation?
