1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,950
   

2
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,000
 If you want to learn the truth, come to Mangyeon Temple. 

3
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:29,560


4
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:05,220
 We understand you won't be working on the HQ Motors project. 

5
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,810
   

6
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,700
   

7
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,170
What's all this? 
    

8
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,540
So Eun Ho.

9
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,230
What exactly are you doing?

10
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,960
   

11
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,710
   

12
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,490
   

13
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,850
   

14
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,180
   

15
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,450
   

16
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:31,890
What's with you?

17
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:35,700
What are you doing? And what's with this place?

18
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,000
You seem to have a lot of questions.

19
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,770
Are you kidding me right now?

20
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,810
I have a lot too.

21
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:50,560
Do you even remember?

22
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,150
Remember what?

23
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:55,780
I didn't expect you to.

24
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,830
When I first saw you two years ago,

25
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:03,110
you didn't seem to remember anything then either.

26
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:09,420
 The competitor has a similar marketing budget and model. 

27
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:14,180
 How can you become the winner in that situation? 

28
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:21,900
 You really didn't remember me at all. 

29
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,290
 Hey you, the late student. Do you want to try answering it? 

30
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:35,950
What are you trying to tell me?

31
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,910
I'm saying it wasn't the first time.

32
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:45,140
That wasn't the first time we met.

33
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:47,380
What are you talking about?

34
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,400
Try and remember.

35
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,510
I'll give you a week.

36
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,450
 I'll give you a week. 

37
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:00,490
 I'll acknowledge it if you find the evidence in a week. 

38
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:05,080
I'll give you a week.

39
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,020
Beg for forgiveness sincerely and reveal the truth by then.

40
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,510
Then I'll also stop.

41
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,870
By chance...

42
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:33,570
 - I'll give you a week. 
 - Pardon? 

43
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,510
 Find a scent just for Charman candle by the next board meeting. 

44
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:40,230
   

45
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,580
   

46
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,150
   

47
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,030
   

48
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:20,710
Bandi Incense.

49
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,690
   

50
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,940
   

51
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,500
 Please look forward to the new Daeseongjang. 

52
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,400
Team Leader Do?

53
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,580
She's back.

54
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,310
Where's Kang Na Eon?

55
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:57,980
Why are you looking for her here?

56
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,480
You're the Underdog Team leader.

57
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,990
- You are. 
 - Yup.

58
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:05,910
I couldn't find her. I thought she might have come to see her boyfriend.

59
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,600
So Eun Ho isn't Team Leader Kang's. He's mine.

60
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,330
Unbelievable.

61
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,470
- Chi. 
 - Bboong.

62
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,570
You can't just leave! Clean the room at least!

63
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,160
You should at least pretend to do something.

64
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,490
   

65
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:32,940
- What? 
 - I was looking for you.

66
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,960
Where are you?

67
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:38,710
 I prepared a present for you. I wanted to know when you'd come. 

68
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,530
Huh? What's this?

69
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:55,210
- Come here. What's this? 
 - What is it? What is it?

70
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:58,910
   

71
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,380
I'll reveal...

72
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,470
Kang Na Eon's past?

73
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,410
   

74
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:13,980
   

75
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,900
 The condition So Eun Ho's demanding. What is it? 

76
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:28,570
 He wants to know the truth about Kang Na Eon's case from five years ago. 

77
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:09,990
   

78
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,270
 Hey, Na Eon. Where are you? 

79
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,410
Why?

80
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:30,650
 A strange warning was posted on the company's bulletin board page. 

81
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,060
So Eun Ho.

82
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,590
So Eun Ho!

83
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,620
What's this? 
    

84
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,770
Does So Eun Ho actually...

85
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,850
have something to do with Bandi Incense?

86
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,700
   

87
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:29,050
So Eun Ho?

88
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,560
Are you okay?

89
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,120
The HR team is looking for you everywhere.

90
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,750
Mind your own business.

91
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,920
Na Eon, let me help you.

92
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,000
Team 1's team leader, Kang Na Eon.

93
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,810
Art Team's team leader, Cha Jeong Woo. We're nothing more than that.

94
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,610
That's what I want you to be.

95
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:52,970
Why are you trying to take all the burden alone?

96
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,090
Because I need to do this...

97
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:01,070
to fix this.

98
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:19,690
The truth of that day?

99
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,540
Since you took care of the HQ Motors case,

100
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,740
I'll tell you as a reward.

101
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,370
The incident from five years ago.

102
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,140
What's the truth behind it?

103
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,970
The truth is...

104
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,010
quite simple.

105
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:47,310
The one who's responsible for everything

106
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,600
is Team Leader Kang Na Eon.

107
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,910
Do you have any evidence?

108
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,150
This is for insurance.

109
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,360
Someone else's dog...

110
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:27,010
can change their mind and bite you at any time.

111
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,610
Gosh, look who's here.

112
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,800
I know. Can you guess?

113
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:02,280
You took my team member and prevented me from touching the HQ Motors project.

114
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,510
Did you learn about our partnership already?

115
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,740
That's no fun.

116
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:13,410
So Eun Ho and I just suited each other very well.

117
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:15,750
We have the same goal.

118
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,270
It's to kill Kang Na Eon.

119
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:27,450
You talk as if you actually have the weapon to kill me.

120
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,430
Of course, I do.

121
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:34,960
I've had it for the last five years.

122
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,020
I also became very curious...

123
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:44,300
what you would do if So Eun Ho actually got his hands on it?

124
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,260
Will he actually kill you?

125
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:56,130
Instead of worrying about me,

126
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:59,280
you better worry about your own life.

127
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,910
But I'm not guilty of anything, unlike you.

128
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,650
It's hard...

129
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,030
but I've always been a bastard.

130
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,660
   

131
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:36,010
 They don't even acknowledge how great your ideas are. 

132
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,570
 If a major company like Segye Group did the marketing for us, 

133
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,480
 more people would learn about us. 

134
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,060
 Here we go again. 

135
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:50,190
 Brand identities come from the person who created the brand. 

136
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:55,440
 What would be the point of using the Segye Group name to hire masters? 

137
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,710
 It would be nice if more people knew about us, 

138
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:03,480
 but I'd be happier if just one person truly understood and liked our brand. 

139
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,030
 You're so freaking cool. 

140
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:08,210
 Is Bandi Incense a brand just for So Eun Ho then? 

141
00:16:08,210 --> 00:16:11,140
 Geez, get out of here. 

142
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,130
 But you know what? 

143
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:18,530
 Making your brand an international brand... 

144
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:21,160
 is my dream, Da Eun. 

145
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,860
 What's this? 

146
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,240
 Ta-da. 

147
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,790
   

148
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:55,020
 Shouldn't you work if you want the evidence? 

149
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:58,100
 See you at Segye Group. 

150
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,270
Okay, then.

151
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,840
   

152
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,130
   

153
00:17:21,840 --> 00:17:24,740
We'll resume the HQ Motors project.

154
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,620
- Pardon? 
 - Pardon?

155
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:31,550
But you said you weren't going to.

156
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,850
I heard you rejected them yourself.

157
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,030
Why did you change your mind?

158
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:38,160
Whoever doesn't want to, can leave.

159
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,860
- No, no, it's not that. What I meant was... 
 - No, no. It's not that...

160
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:44,100
I'm telling all of you to leave.

161
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,600
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

162
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:10,300
 I printed them and deleted the file since I felt guilty keeping it. 

163
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,260
 I can't continue because I'm scared. 

164
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:28,110
 This won't be enough. 

165
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:31,330
 To find Director Han's weakness, 

166
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:37,250
 I will need to take back the HQ Motors project. 

167
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,110
Did you become a loner again, Na Eon?

168
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,910
Did you see the present I gave you?

169
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,910
Yu Mi,

170
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:56,600
I don't have time to entertain you right now.

171
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,700
I definitely saw him five years ago. Why didn't I remember?

172
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,400
I would've told you if I did.

173
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:10,710
The owner of Bandi Incense, whom you stole from, is back.

174
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,930
Are you serious right now?

175
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,470
So, it was true.

176
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,610
I was just sounding you out.

177
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:19,950
Your idea of using the masters was really amazing.

178
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:24,300
But that wasn't your idea.

179
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,630
Have you been stealing all the branding work you've done—

180
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:33,010
Do Yu Mi.

181
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:34,380
What?

182
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:37,440
Do you feel like you should listen to me now?

183
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,470
No.

184
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:44,590
I'll destroy Director Han first.

185
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:51,430
Everyone who's related to him better be careful.

186
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,650
The marketing presentation for HQ Motor's new business—

187
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:23,380
   

188
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,250
Team Leader Kang.

189
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:28,120
I came myself since there wasn't time to send the proposal.

190
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,480
You all know who I am, correct?

191
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,950
What are you doing right now?

192
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,940
The presentation is starting soon.

193
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:38,440
There are two products with the same specifications that haven't been revealed yet.

194
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,810
Which product will the consumers purchase?

195
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,820
- Please leave for now and— 
 - Let's talk later.

196
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,990
If they have the same specifications,

197
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:55,390
they'll purchase the product with the logo they recognize.

198
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:57,070
Because it feels reliable.

199
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,690
Branding is the same.

200
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:03,590
The early outcome depends on who creates the brand.

201
00:21:03,590 --> 00:21:07,910
HQ Motor's new technology that I handpicked and created the branding for.

202
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:12,600
If it was me, I wouldn't want anyone to take it away.

203
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:18,270
Let's be fair and let me present my idea.

204
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:21,250
Let us compete with our presentations.

205
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:26,120
You should let the branding expert work on the branding.

206
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:27,570
I don't know what to say.

207
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:32,640
Segye Group said they'll also send us a renowned expert.

208
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,010
Do you think there's a talent like me at Segye Group?

209
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:40,660
If there were,

210
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:45,140
they would have already become Seongsu Agency's Team 1 team leader.

211
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,020
But there is.

212
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:52,270
I heard Segye Group is reviving its marketing team.

213
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:56,110
And their team leader will be here today.

214
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:59,500
The recent pop-ups in Seongsu-dong...

215
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:02,630
were apparently all done by that person.

216
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:17,660
Seriously?

217
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,760
I'm Segye Group's marketing team leader,

218
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:35,320
So Eun Ho.

219
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:40,570
I told you to reveal the truth and ask for forgiveness.

220
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,770
But you're trying to steal someone else's idea again.

221
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:48,740
Why do you think you can keep acting out like this?

222
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,610
You're basically from the same company. What are you doing?

223
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:53,170
Sort things out between you first.

224
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:55,490
- For the presentation— 
 - I will—

225
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,720
Are you two okay?

226
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,490
Team Leader Kang.

227
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:05,710
Team Leader Kang!

228
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,700
Team Leader Kang?

229
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:59,860


230
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:12,440
This is the last chance for both of you.

231
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,120
Good luck.

232
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,020
   

233
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:25,060
♫  After the wave of thoughts came to a stop  ♫

234
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:30,580
♫  The sadness overflows  ♫

235
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:42,100
♫  I'm holding back, my heart that overflows again with hope  ♫

236
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:45,140
♫  After hesitating  ♫

237
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:49,030
♫  I'm hesitating, mmm ~  ♫

238
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:54,950
♫  The words just flow out like this  ♫

239
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:59,020
♫  My days and nights are all about you  ♫

240
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,190
♫  So much so that I also forget myself  ♫

241
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:07,710
♫  So will you stay with me?  ♫
