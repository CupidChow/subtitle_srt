What was that?

9
00:01:16,657 --> 00:01:17,728
Oh, my.

10
00:01:22,139 --> 00:01:24,779
My gosh. This looks awesome.

11
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,309
What do you think?

12
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,949
What do I think? About what?

13
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:32,520
This is a marketing package put together...

14
00:01:32,589 --> 00:01:34,490
by Seongsu Agency.

15
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,120
From the commercial casting process...

16
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:37,819
Ta-Da!

17
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,029
To the outdoor billboard.

18
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:40,828
This year, we're focusing on our new beauty line...

19
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,059
targeting Millennial and Gen Z.

20
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:45,169
Don't you think an outdoor billboard is a little too old-fashioned?

21
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,799
Oh, that's...

22
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,900
Also,

23
00:01:48,499 --> 00:01:49,770
about Ms. Kang Na Eon.

24
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,540
Wasn't she supposed to be here today?

25
00:01:56,339 --> 00:01:59,949
I don't think Ms. Kang can make it today.

26
00:02:01,449 --> 00:02:02,479
I'm pretty sure she can't.

27
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:03,719
Oh, I'm sorry.

28
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:06,020
I meant to tell you that the meeting time had changed,

29
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:08,420
but I totally forgot.

30
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:10,219
Why is the traffic so bad?

31
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:13,830
Gosh, this is nuts. I only have 15 minutes left.

32
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:20,469
Mr. Nam, that jerk.

33
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:22,438
How could he take the liberty of moving the meeting...

34
00:02:22,439 --> 00:02:24,069
and not even tell us?

35
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:27,439
How's it possible that you didn't know the meeting had been moved?

36
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,710
Well, I double-checked everything.

37
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:32,908
Besides, he's the one who wronged us. I didn't...

38
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:35,480
Wasn't it obvious that he'd try to mess with us?

39
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,248
The fact that you foolishly let him do it is worse than what he did.

40
00:02:39,249 --> 00:02:40,718
Come on, Na Eon.

41
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,420
- Sir. - Yes?

42
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:45,929
Please get there in 5 minutes. We'll pay you 200 dollars more.

43
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,089
Come on. Don't you see all this traffic?

44
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:50,360
I can't magically clear the road.

45
00:02:51,159 --> 00:02:52,870
- How about 300 dollars? - Sorry?

46
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,400
Then how about 400?

47
00:02:54,969 --> 00:02:56,469
If we can't find a way, we should create one.

48
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:09,580
Watch out! There's a car coming!

49
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:15,288
Someone's crossing the street!

50
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:16,319
Oh, no!

51
00:03:19,059 --> 00:03:21,430
My gosh. This is nuts.

52
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,599
(One Way)

53
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,640
Pay him 500 dollars. He got us here in 4 minutes.

54
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:32,170
Oh, okay.

55
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:34,969
Here. You can charge us 500 dollars.

56
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:41,050
(More than Stylish Underwear)

57
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:43,480
He's always so predictable.

58
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,349
All his predictable, stupid antics.

59
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,390
Hey, it's me.

60
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,359
Café Seine in Seongsu-dong.

61
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,960
- In three minutes. - Please be on standby.

62
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,758
Hey, I'm on standby right now.

63
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:58,299
- We'll rehearse the scene. - Be on standby until you die.

64
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,099
- It's for a bedroom scene. - Gosh. That was nuts, wasn't it?

65
00:04:03,069 --> 00:04:04,099
Shall we?

66
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,909
Okay.

67
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,779
Everyone says...

68
00:04:17,449 --> 00:04:19,319
You're late. Very late.

69
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:21,920
Yes, thanks to you.

70
00:04:23,389 --> 00:04:24,919
"The traffic was bad."

71
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,789
"I was misinformed about the meeting time."

72
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:28,959
"There was an unfortunate accident on the way."

73
00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:31,030
And so on.

74
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:32,869
Whatever your excuse is,

75
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,170
I said I'd spare you 50 minutes of my time, so...

76
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,639
There are three minutes left.

77
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,769
You have three minutes to convince me.

78
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,910
Tell me the reasons...

79
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,480
I must work with you, not with Mr. Nam.

80
00:04:49,249 --> 00:04:50,680
The lead actor in that film.

81
00:04:51,019 --> 00:04:52,489
He was arrested three times for a DUI.

82
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,649
He was caught gambling overseas...

83
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,319
and has been charged with assault in the past.

84
00:04:56,059 --> 00:04:58,189
He was a criminal who had done unforgivable things,

85
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:00,759
but he's shooting films as if nothing ever happened.

86
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,498
With that film, he's been nominated...

87
00:05:03,499 --> 00:05:05,600
for Best Actor in an international film festival.

88
00:05:06,629 --> 00:05:08,499
And he's been in a number of TV commercials.

89
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:11,100
Oh, no. You only have a minute left.

90
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:12,939
It was only possible...

91
00:05:13,709 --> 00:05:15,540
because I helped him improve his public image.

92
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,379
Through personal branding.

93
00:05:25,749 --> 00:05:27,949
You see, what people need is a plaything.

94
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:31,990
I only chose crime movies on purpose when helping him pick his projects,

95
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,199
so people could chew him out all they wanted.

96
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,730
Then they actually started to like him.

97
00:05:38,459 --> 00:05:41,030
And how do I trust that you're telling me the truth?

98
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,100
He should be here any minute now.

99
00:06:00,019 --> 00:06:01,990
Over here! Na Eon, I'm here.

100
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,990
She called me here.

101
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:05,829
Kang Na Eon!

102
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:08,459
Whenever I summon him,

103
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:11,259
he comes running like a dog within three minutes.

104
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,930
Unbelievable.

105
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,399
She called me here.

106
00:06:18,499 --> 00:06:19,569
I'm amused.

107
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:21,410
I'd like to amuse you even more,

108
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,110
but my time is up.

109
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,350
Then why don't I spare you an additional 50 minutes?

110
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,059
How about we go for a walk? Just the two of us.

111
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:38,790
Will that be all right?

112
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,230
Having a 1-on-1 with a specific marketer...

113
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:44,800
and letting the public see it.

114
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,399
My question is, can you really handle it and what it means?

115
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:54,069
Of course, I can handle it.

116
00:06:58,139 --> 00:06:59,410
When it comes to media coverage...

117
00:07:00,079 --> 00:07:02,249
The bigger, the better.

118
00:07:09,559 --> 00:07:11,789
Wait, I like walking too.

119
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,129
Mr. Nam.

120
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,829
If you like to walk, I suggest you walk all the way back...

121
00:07:18,459 --> 00:07:19,800
to the office.

122
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:22,870
Hey.

123
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,399

124
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,840
Hey.

Aren't you most interested in the re-branding project?

129

I suggest you join forces with Seongsu Agency.

130
00:08:07,449 --> 00:08:08,449
Sounds good.

131
00:08:09,749 --> 00:08:11,019
I'll follow your suggestion.

134
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:17,660

- with a realtor first. - Got it.

- Forget the union executives. - Okay, not the executives.

148
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,239
Approach the cobblers first as it'll be easier to persuade them.

149
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,409
- The cobblers. - Have 1-on-1 meetings with them.

- I'll post it on social media too. - Yes.

181
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:27,788
How does she do it? She'll bring in the most revenue again.

182
00:10:27,789 --> 00:10:30,819
I know. It's not easy to land a contract with XU Beauty.

183
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,628
- How did she do it? - Can you take care of it?

184
00:10:32,629 --> 00:10:35,059
- Sure, no problem. - Ms. Kang did it again.

In my new book...

187
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,128
I hear Ms. Kang's book is a hit too.

188
00:10:41,129 --> 00:10:42,699
Last week, she even had a shoot with a YouTube channel.

- For real? - She's a celebrity now.

Everyone says she's guaranteed to get a promotion...

191
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:49,110
and become the youngest member of the executive team.

192
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,039
My gosh. She really has it all.

193
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,980
I wonder if someone like her has any worries.

194
00:10:54,249 --> 00:10:55,350
I wonder too.

195
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:58,379
She sure does. A big worry.

196
00:10:59,919 --> 00:11:01,649
- What could that be? - What could that be?

197
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,459
Having a lot of enemies.

198
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,489
(How does she do this every single time? What's her secret?)

(Others would think she's doing all the work. Are we all her minions?)

202
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,470
(I hear she gets a fat salary, so she should do more work.)

203
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,639
(She's competent. I give her that, but she's nasty.)

I would've planned a longer vacation had I known this would happen.

Don't say that.

218
00:12:07,789 --> 00:12:09,320
I heard about what happened today.

219
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,330
I think Director Han has got Mr. Nam's back.

220
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:16,960
That's why Mr. Nam is acting up, thinking he can get away with it.

My gosh.

222

So, what they're saying on the forum is true?

223
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:21,899
I should post a comment.

Birds of a feather flock together.

225
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,440
I'm acting up too, because I know I have you.

She was the reason I joined this company.

As if Ms. Kang would listen to a mere intern.

309
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,230
You see, Na Eon isn't like that.

- Shut it. - like a really nasty person,

317

324
00:16:45,299 --> 00:16:47,469
Na Eon, that is not what I meant.

325
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,470
Come to my office.

326
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,740
Wait, Na Eon.

327

I know you're very fond of me,

331

but if you call me into your office in front of all those people...

332

Well...

334
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,060
I just think...

00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:21,030

According to my research, there are many suspicious things about them.

341
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,550
Rumour has it that they don't actually use vegan ingredients.

342
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,850
Some even say they still test on animals.

343
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:41,719
There are many problems surrounding...

344
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,360
What problems?

345
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:45,659

349
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,709
But if you want to be righteous while working under me...

350
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:08,110
Quit being a marketer!

351
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:11,949
But... Why?

352
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,989
We can be righteous marketers.

353
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:23,529
That's it for your first special lecture.

00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,359
Na Eon, wait. Na Eon!

355
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,398
(2 years ago)

356
00:18:26,399 --> 00:18:27,830
Wait, one moment.

357
00:18:28,699 --> 00:18:30,770
All right. One, two, three.

358
00:18:33,469 --> 00:18:34,870
Nice. I'll brag about this to everyone.

359
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:37,639
Kang Na Eon's special lecture on careers in marketing...

360
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,878
deeply inspired me.

361
00:18:39,879 --> 00:18:41,050
Why marketing?

362
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,379
It doesn't seem to suit you.

363
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,179
I've travelled quite a bit.

364
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,050
Meeting people from all walks of life taught me...

365
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,459
that consumers often fail to notice good products...

366
00:18:50,719 --> 00:18:53,429
from small businesses because of all the marketing big companies do.

367
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,189
That experience inspired me to become...

368
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:58,360
a marketer who puts people first and treats all clients equally.

369
00:18:58,629 --> 00:19:00,500
You're not the right fit for the agency I work for.

370
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:02,129
Why not?

371
00:19:02,639 --> 00:19:04,540
Do you not hire people who are handsome and good-hearted?

372
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,110
It's not that.

373
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:10,879
We do marketing to treat each client differently.

374
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:12,948
And that difference...

375
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:15,479
is what creates a brand loved by hundreds of millions of people.

376
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,379
Isn't it more important to make people...

377
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:22,659
genuinely love the brand, even if it's just one person?

378
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,760
The same goes with people.

379
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:30,459
If you have one person who truly loves you,

380
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,870
then it's enough.

381
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,120
Come to where I am when I call you.

382
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,388
Na Eon. I know you adore me, but...

383
00:19:54,389 --> 00:19:56,060
- Get out. - Sorry?

384
00:19:57,489 --> 00:19:59,019
I told you to get out.

385
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,129
Oh, okay.

386
00:20:04,699 --> 00:20:08,229
(Team Manager Kang Na Eon)

387
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,270
What's wrong with me?

388
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:18,939
So Eun Ho, that little...

389
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,408
When we got there, I could see that it was all dirty inside.

390
00:20:22,409 --> 00:20:24,549
It looked so dirty inside that I didn't even want to go in.

391
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,049
So I told the others to go inside.

392
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,819
I was like, "Go! Move in! Get them to open the door!"

393
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,418
But I suddenly saw a familiar face inside.

394
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:33,688
In the factory... You know, that guy.

395
00:20:33,689 --> 00:20:36,228
There were rumours about you and him. What was his name?

396
00:20:36,229 --> 00:20:38,499
That's right! So Eun Ho. He was there.

397
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,099
But the thing is,

398
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:44,040
he was protesting, standing among the cobblers at the factory.

399
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:46,770
He's an interesting one.

400
00:20:46,969 --> 00:20:50,139
There were many rumours about the two of you even when he was hired.

401
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,639
People said you two hated each other but were in a romantic relationship.

402
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,350
There's no romance. I just hate him.

403
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,020
All right. First,

404
00:21:01,449 --> 00:21:04,320
I'll show you the sample and what I've done so far.

405
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,830
Okay.

406
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,530
Oh, I see it.

407
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:14,829
From the invitation to the pop-up store itself,

408
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:17,070
we'll keep the visual concept consistent.

409
00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:20,110
I used special iridescent paper for that sample.

410
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,540
Hey, it took me over a month to get my hands on that paper.

411
00:21:22,709 --> 00:21:25,109
My gosh. Jung Woo, you never disappoint.

412
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:26,679
This looks amazing. It's so nice.

413
00:21:27,379 --> 00:21:28,979
And about XU Beauty.

414
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:31,649
Rumour has it that they don't actually use vegan ingredients.

415
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,790
Some even say they still test on animals.

416
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:35,520
I'm sorry,

417
00:21:36,489 --> 00:21:37,520
but let's start over.

418
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:43,530
We'll go with a natural theme and use eco-friendly materials.

419
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,060
By any chance,

420
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:47,399
will I get a double bonus?

421
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:49,100
Just take extra vacation days.

422
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,340
I guess I should look for another job.

423
00:21:53,610 --> 00:21:54,610
Take it easy.

424
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,239
Hey, what about dinner?

425
00:21:57,610 --> 00:21:58,610
You can have dinner with her.

426
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:00,379
Bye!

427
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,050
Jung Woo.

428
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,250
What shall we have? Sashimi? Or how about a nice steak house?

429
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,719
I'll be in the office.

430
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:11,959
It looks like I have to work late starting today.

431
00:22:13,189 --> 00:22:14,229
Enjoy your dinner.

432
00:22:14,729 --> 00:22:15,729
All right.

433
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,899
Darn it. Too bad.

434
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,239
I feel like I'm at my grandma's place.

435
00:22:27,439 --> 00:22:29,909
Eun Ho, I can't believe you had a showdown with Ms. Kang.

436
00:22:30,439 --> 00:22:31,810
It wasn't a showdown.

437
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:33,979
Wasn't it a lovers' quarrel?

438
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,250
- Look at you, Eun Ho. - No, it's not like that.

439
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:38,349
Rumour has it that Ms. Kang uses men...

440
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:41,319
as a way to relieve stress.

441
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,520
- Really? - Yes.

442
00:22:42,959 --> 00:22:44,090
I mean, Eun Ho...

443
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:46,428
may have terrible fashion sense,

444
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:47,760
but he's got a nice face.

445
00:22:48,929 --> 00:22:50,429
That's a compliment, right?

446
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,859
Yes.

447
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:56,000
I'm complimenting you to tell you to please throw out that ugly vest.

448
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:59,239
Come on. I'm still paying the monthly instalments for this.

449
00:22:59,439 --> 00:23:00,510
Also,

450
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,968
what I paid for is the brand image...

451
00:23:01,969 --> 00:23:03,938
that stands for sustainable, eco-friendly fashion,

452
00:23:03,939 --> 00:23:04,939
not the clothes.

453
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,350
Hey, I bet you wear the same underwear for days.

454
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:09,510
Hey, you little... No, I don't.

455
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,120
My gosh, that's gross.

456
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:13,489
What are you saying?

457
00:23:14,949 --> 00:23:16,819
Eun Ho, if you keep acting up like that,

458
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,590
they might send you...

459
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,958
to the underdog team if you do get hired after your internship.

460
00:23:20,959 --> 00:23:22,389
What will you do if that happens?

461
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,330
"Underdog?"

462
00:23:25,959 --> 00:23:28,199
You need to attend the intern training sessions.

463
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,169
At Seongsu Agency,

464
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:31,669

465
00:23:32,169 --> 00:23:33,209

467
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,080
First,

468
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,310
no one can deny that she is the most powerful person in the company.

469
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:42,280
Managed by Ms. Kang is Team One,

470
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:43,919
Team Diamond.

471
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,988
Managed by Mr. Nam, who is always vying...

472
00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:50,959
for an opportunity to beat her is Team Two,

473
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:54,929
Team Platinum.

474
00:23:57,060 --> 00:24:00,229
The two teams are supported by the art team,

475
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:02,129
which is managed by Ms. Kang's greatest supporter,

476
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,500
Mr. Cha Jung Woo.

477
00:24:04,239 --> 00:24:07,139
There are two additional teams that are sort of on their own.

478
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:14,149
One, two!

479
00:24:17,219 --> 00:24:18,780
At the bottom of the pyramid, there is...

480
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,289
the underdog team, which uses the storage room in the corner...

481
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,350
as their office.

482
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,489
It's my own fault...

483
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,260
for ending up here.

484
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:32,600
The planning team lost the fight.

485
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,869
I hear Ms. Kang sends all good-for-nothings...

486
00:24:39,870 --> 00:24:43,110
to that team, without exception.

487
00:24:44,209 --> 00:24:46,209
It's basically like telling them to quit voluntarily.

488
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,249
It wouldn't be a bad idea to say farewell to her in advance.

489
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,280
Agreed.
