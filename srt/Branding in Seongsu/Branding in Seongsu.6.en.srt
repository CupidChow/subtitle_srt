What do you think you're doing?

00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,330
Are you also here because you were suspicious of me?

5
00:00:11,201 --> 00:00:12,630
Do you know how many times I was questioned...

6
00:00:12,631 --> 00:00:13,771
by the police in a month?

7
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:17,771

A dumb yet innocent repairman...

13
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:49,131
who risked his family's well-being for handmade shoes that don't sell?

14
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:51,341
- What did you say? - Or...

15
00:00:53,271 --> 00:00:55,271
are you a murderer who let anger get the best of him...

16
00:00:56,441 --> 00:00:57,811

This would have been fair had I actually killed Na Eon.

28
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,151

85

96
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,051
- so start drinking! - Yes!

97
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,281

call me about handmade shoes.

103

They did? I'm so sorry.

104
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,470
Reject them. I'll get you something else.

105
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:22,769
- Seriously? - You bet.

106
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,740
- You have to keep your promise. - Of course.

107
00:06:24,741 --> 00:06:25,840
- Cheers. - Cheers.

108
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:28,610
For the great actor, I'll...

109
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:30,781
I'm not sure if you can pull it off.

110
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:32,481
Pull off what?

111
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,510
Everything that Na Eon used to pull off.

112
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,121
Oh, my goodness.

113
00:06:39,851 --> 00:06:41,449
Na Eon had you on a leash like a dog...

114
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,491
because she had dirt on you.

115
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:45,221
This is how you stay loyal?

116
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:51,061
At one point, it made me wonder...

117
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,069
whether you did that...

118
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:57,371
to Na Eon.

119
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,171
Why?

120
00:07:01,811 --> 00:07:04,710
Na Eon was all up in his face, you know?

121
00:07:05,311 --> 00:07:06,411
Am I wrong?

122
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,481
She was! Don't you remember?

123
00:07:10,351 --> 00:07:11,681
Stop acting like Na Eon...

124
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,690
when we both know that you can't be her.

125
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,830
Are you crazy?

126
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,500
- What do you think you're doing? - Stop.

127
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,339
- Yoo Mi! - Let go! Didn't you see him?

128
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,400
That's enough.

129
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:35,241
Stop drinking. Let's get out of here.

130
00:07:37,111 --> 00:07:39,111
Did you not drink it because I bought it?

131
00:07:39,481 --> 00:07:41,411
Are you ignoring me as well?

132
00:07:44,351 --> 00:07:45,481

133
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,690

138

158
00:10:22,411 --> 00:10:24,181
He's just her boyfriend.

159
00:10:24,911 --> 00:10:26,110
He's not her boyfriend.

160

Is that so important to you?

161

Yes, it is important.

I don't look like Na Eon today?

168
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,161
I should go and see Na Eon,

169
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,761
so I can resemble her.

170

- to the best VIP ward. - Yes, sir.

181

It's declined, sir.

182
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,070
A six-month installment plan, then.

183
00:12:36,811 --> 00:12:37,881

00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,209
Emergency!

187
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,319
Ms. Do called a general meeting!

188
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,551
I'm going to take a leave.

189

193
00:13:36,271 --> 00:13:37,940

(Do Yoo Mi, Marketing Manager, Team 1)

195
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,660
- These are your colors. - Right.

196
00:14:00,661 --> 00:14:01,791
I like the pink one.

197
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,041
It's nice to gather in one place. Am I right?

198
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,271
Yes.

199
00:14:17,881 --> 00:14:19,680
Why don't we have Underdog report first?

200
00:14:19,681 --> 00:14:21,710
- Sorry? - Oh, my. What do we do?

201
00:14:22,281 --> 00:14:23,751
This is bad.

202
00:14:32,521 --> 00:14:35,561
What is wrong with you? Stop shaking.

203
00:14:36,391 --> 00:14:37,460
We will now...

204
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,661
begin the presentation...

205
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:42,430
on premiumizing the handmade shoe factory...

206
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,770
- Have you decided on a model? - Well...

207
00:14:44,771 --> 00:14:46,869
You'll need one of the best celebrities as it's luxury-themed.

208
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:51,410
Yes, we're going through the list to call them.

209
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:52,740
Strangely enough,

210
00:14:53,381 --> 00:14:54,911
they all rejected our offer...

211
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:56,450
with the exact same sentence.

212
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:00,850
Maybe, someone was behind it.

213
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:04,220
You must have written a poor proposal.

214
00:15:05,921 --> 00:15:07,031
And the concept image?

215
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:08,761
Yes.

216
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,401
I've brought some drafts.

217
00:15:25,911 --> 00:15:27,381
(Rebranding of Handmade Shoes)

218
00:15:29,881 --> 00:15:31,251
This is the first draft.

219
00:15:40,061 --> 00:15:42,891
We're rebranding it to target the richest customers.

220
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,430

221

"Handmade shoes that no one wears..."

222
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,641

223
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,740
Try again.

224
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:58,440
Why? Do you not like it?

225
00:15:58,681 --> 00:15:59,710
I don't.

226
00:15:59,911 --> 00:16:00,911
What are your opinions?

227
00:16:01,781 --> 00:16:04,620
Is it because it was done by Lex?

228
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,151
The colors don't seem to fit.

229
00:16:07,421 --> 00:16:08,551
That's odd.

230
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,791
We had an outside company that Ms. Do often worked with...

231
00:16:11,061 --> 00:16:12,421
to do the job.

232
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:17,801
Art Director, isn't this company qualified enough?

233
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:19,700
Well,

234
00:16:20,131 --> 00:16:22,131
we do work with them when we're short of hands.

235
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:26,340
Framing...

236
00:16:27,271 --> 00:16:28,641
is quite terrifying, isn't it?

237
00:16:34,381 --> 00:16:35,651
Mr. So.

238
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:39,720
Don't tell me you believe that you're Na Eon.

239
00:16:45,021 --> 00:16:47,390
Why are you bringing her up?

240
00:16:47,391 --> 00:16:50,561
It's just that you're acting just like her.

241
00:16:51,631 --> 00:16:55,001
You had zero trust in your teammates and had to boss it.

242
00:16:55,501 --> 00:16:56,671
And you're a newbie, of all people.

243
00:17:00,741 --> 00:17:01,870
But you know what?

244
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:05,909
No one will care if you lie unconscious...

245
00:17:05,910 --> 00:17:07,251
for a month, even if you act like her.

246
00:17:07,511 --> 00:17:09,650
As if everyone wanted it to happen to you.

247
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:13,791
Goodness.

248
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:16,090
She has a point.

249
00:17:17,021 --> 00:17:18,761
Poor him.

250
00:17:50,261 --> 00:17:51,320
Enough.

251
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,660
Why don't we wrap it up now?

252
00:17:58,061 --> 00:18:00,930
My teammates wanted to have something fancy for lunch.

253
00:18:09,241 --> 00:18:11,079
Let's wrap it up. Good work, everyone.

254
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:13,579
- Good work. - Great job.

255
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,250
- Good meeting. - Good job.

256
00:18:15,251 --> 00:18:16,311
Enjoy your lunch.

257
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Come on.

258
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,109
Let's get him tasty food.

259
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:43,170
- Sure. - That will make him feel better.

260
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:50,010
You're naturally overzealous when you're new,

261
00:18:50,011 --> 00:18:51,420
and you're bound to make mistakes.

262
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,350
I used to yell at my boss in his office when I was new.

263
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,561
"Let me eat twice at the cafeteria!"

264
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:04,829
Sweetheart, I am a bit offended...

265
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:08,201
that you disregarded me and gave the presentation,

266
00:19:08,801 --> 00:19:10,440
but you're handsome,

267
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,711
so I'll let you off the hook for two meals. Just kidding!

268
00:19:14,711 --> 00:19:16,541
- Tasty food. - Let's see.

269
00:19:16,811 --> 00:19:18,780
Did you contact Actor Park's agency?

270
00:19:18,781 --> 00:19:20,710
They said they'd call back, so I'm waiting.

271
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:22,010
I want the extra size.

272
00:19:22,011 --> 00:19:24,879
- Then, the design should be... - Oh, sweetheart.

273
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,679
You're rushing.

274
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,990
We have until next week's meeting to do that.

275
00:19:28,991 --> 00:19:30,389
- Tell them we'll write a review. - Yes.

276
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:32,120
What do you want to eat?

277
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,691
Do you want to...

278
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,961
stay here forever as losers?

279
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:41,731
What?

280
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,170
Sweetheart, you're being harsh.

281
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:47,710
Who do you think you are to call us losers?

282
00:19:47,711 --> 00:19:49,569
- Stop it. - Let me correct myself.

283
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,511
Yes, correct yourself!

284
00:19:53,850 --> 00:19:56,251
I accused Ms. Do of framing us in the meeting earlier,

285
00:19:57,281 --> 00:19:58,481
but she wasn't.

286
00:20:00,221 --> 00:20:02,090
You guys are actual losers.

287
00:20:04,191 --> 00:20:05,461
This is ridiculous.

288
00:20:06,021 --> 00:20:07,090
Hey.

289
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,889
You were the one...

290
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:11,061
who neglected our work and took on the rebranding project.

291
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:14,001
The misfit and loser of our team...

292
00:20:14,501 --> 00:20:15,630
is you.

293
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:17,971
- Stop it. - I see.

294
00:20:19,241 --> 00:20:22,340
So you don't have to work so hard as you have two jobs?

295
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,110
- What are you saying? - A queen's soul...

296

You don't have any friends, do you?

300
00:20:41,261 --> 00:20:42,330
Gosh.

301
00:21:01,481 --> 00:21:03,450
We'll head home now.

302
00:21:03,451 --> 00:21:04,620
Great work today.

303
00:21:04,781 --> 00:21:06,221
Aren't you going home?

304
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:08,320
I have to visit someone at the hospital.

305
00:21:08,521 --> 00:21:09,620
I'll see you tomorrow.

306
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:11,890
Bye!

307
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,691
Who's at the hospital?

308
00:21:15,491 --> 00:21:17,030

Or else, you will face strong resistance!
