1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,500
   

2
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:34,930


3
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:18,860
   

4
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:20,800
   

5
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,490
   

6
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,960
   

7
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,260
   

8
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:45,410
   

9
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,510
Joo Rex was transferred to Underdog. 
    

10
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,370
Don't blame me.

11
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,000
You asked for it.

12
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,880
Is being stylish a sin?

13
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,770
Not wearing clothes is.

14
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:20,580
Wearing a jacket without a shirt underneath when meeting a client is.

15
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:23,560
You don't understand anything about fashion.

16
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,180
Sunbae.

17
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,820
What is it?

18
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,670
No way. Did you...

19
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,450
Who else knows?

20
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,310
No one.

21
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,540
F***. Seriously.

22
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,160
It's okay. It's okay.

23
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,870
It's okay.

24
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,390
   

25
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,960
   

26
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,020
   

27
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,510
You're still insisting on cruelty-free marketing?

28
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,070
   

29
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:52,970
The pop-up is next week.

30
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:54,720
There's no time to change things.

31
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,000
- Then are you just going to leave it alone? 
 - No.

32
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,070
We should cover it up completely.

33
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:07,700
What do you mean?

34
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,400
Showing the strength and hiding the weakness.

35
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,770
That's what branding is.

36
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,650
I came this far because I'm good at that.

37
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,010
For putting mascara on a few rabbits,

38
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,770
will you blow a multi-billion won contract?

39
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,020
What if that's not everything?

40
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:41,780
What if the rumor about using animal fat is also true?

41
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,380
If it harms people and not just a few rabbits,

42
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:50,340
would that change your mind at all?

43
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,550
If you won't do it,

44
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,210
I'll do it my way.

45
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,360
Hey.

46
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,760
If you want to challenge me,

47
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,000
don't start with a silly complaint.

48
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,200
I can even sell my soul.

49
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,290
I can bet everything I have.

50
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,760
Get lost.

51
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,900
- Sunbae. 
 - I said get lost.

52
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,800
   

53
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,980
   

54
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,670
Why does she have to take it this far?

55
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:49,810
   

56
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,150
 Hello? 

57
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,460
 Eun Ho. 

58
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,920
Da Eun.

59
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,690
 Are you okay? 

60
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:02,530
I'm not sure what to do.

61
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,970
 Do you want to come to Mangyeonsa? 

62
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,220
Why does my head hurt so much?

63
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,700
   

64
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:12,490
Come on in, Team Leader Kang.

65
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,100
It looks like we need to improve the security at the factory.

66
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:41,680
Are there any more risk factors I need to know about?

67
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,920
What's so risky?

68
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,810
The public won't know, anyway.

69
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,390
You know about herd mentality right?

70
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:58,460
You can get people to follow whatever you lead them.

71
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,830
You told me that...

72
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:06,520
leading people like that... is your specialty.

73
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,980
Oh, and...

74
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:13,770
I heard something about the incident from five years ago too.

75
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:21,920
People aren't so stupid these days.

76
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,340
Then make sure they stay stupid.

77
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:34,020
Isn't that what you get paid to do?

78
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,840
If so...

79
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:40,080
including risk management,

80
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,060
it will be this much. What do you say?

81
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,590
   

82
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,750
   

83
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,190
You've got strangely good timing.

84
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:03,700
It's as if you've been waiting for something to happen.

85
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:09,750
Because... the bigger the story...

86
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,980
the better.

87
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:19,220
   

88
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,350
   

89
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:25,850
Team Leader Kang, is it true that you'll be exclusively in charge of XU and all of its subsidiaries?

90
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:28,330
My sincere passion for XU...

91
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,350
   

92
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,400
seems to have worked.

93
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,940
 A unicorn startup, Seongsu Agency, signed a huge contract. 

94
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:40,030
 They secured the exclusive marketing deal with a global corporation, XU, 
   

95
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:41,940
 and all of its subsidiary companies. 
   

96
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:44,450
 Seongsu Agency became the highest earning subsidiary of 
   

97
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:46,720
 Segye Group within the five years since it was established. 
    

98
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,870
 The agency's course of action is drawing people's attention. 
   

99
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:55,030
 The public has a lot of opinions about Team Leader Kang Na Eon who made this possible. 
   

100
00:10:55,030 --> 00:11:01,530
 An employee at Segye Group said they are looking forward to the synergy between 
   

101
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:05,290
 XU and Seongsu Agency, the biggest marketing agency in the country, 
   

102
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:10,020
 starting with Team Leader Kang's pop-up store for XU Beauty's new product. 

103
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:46,450
What would you like to do?

104
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,920
I don't know, Da Eun.

105
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,390
Do what you want to do.

106
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,430
I'll be right back.

107
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,920
 I entered this company all because of Kang Na Eon Sunbae! 

108
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,840
 If you are going to act all righteous on my team, 

109
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,450
 then don't do marketing! 

110
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:25,960
 We can just do righteous marketing! 

111
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,900
 - Then are you just going to leave it alone? 
 - No. 

112
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:31,430
 We should cover it up completely. 

113
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:35,040
 The customer is not answering the phone. 

114
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:44,010
I don't know what you heard, but we don't ever test on animals. I'm serious.

115
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:46,110
Hold on, hold on, hold on, Eun Ho!

116
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:47,670
You haven't had lunch today either, right?

117
00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:51,730
I can't just look the other way for some mapo tofu. Understand?

118
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,060
Hold on.

119
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,660
Let's get Western food if you don't want Chinese food.

120
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,730
   

121
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:05,040
This is just storage.

122
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,900
What happened?

123
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,600
I heard you're already moving forward and getting a pop-up location. Soon too.

124
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,750
I can't understand why you're poking around at this point.

125
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,380
Pardon?

126
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,000
My gosh, didn't you know?

127
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,380
I heard you already made a deal with the shoemakers.

128
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:51,980
   

129
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:59,140
Okay. We're eating fried chicken today.

130
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:02,100
- Did you put glue on that? 
 - No.

131
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,260
Are you eating by yourself first?

132
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,750
What took you so long?

133
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:08,620
- Have some of this. 
 - Have some.

134
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,410
- Good work! 
 - Cheers!

135
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:14,720
What? Why are you coming here?

136
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,800
Move, move, move.

137
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,800
- Come on, let's sleep together. 
 -  Aigoo, aigoo! 

138
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,450
Geez, you guys...

139
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:26,980
 We oppose! We oppose! 

140
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:30,530
 Absolutely opposed to it! 

141
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,510
 Hello. 

142
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:35,550
 You just need to sign this here. 

143
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:37,150
 Yes. 

144
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,580
   

145
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,370
   

146
00:14:44,810 --> 00:14:48,920
 Thank you. Sorry for the trouble. 

147
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,650
   

148
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,000
   

149
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,350
 Good work. 

150
00:15:00,930 --> 00:15:03,360
 You did well. Why are you crying, man? 

151
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,230
 You did well. 

152
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,400
 Why do you look so guilty? You did well. 

153
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:11,710
 You did well. You really did a good job. 

154
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:16,820
   

155
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,180
There you are, sir!

156
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,880
- Congratulations! 
 - A comment, please.

157
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,770
Please comment on the Seongdong handmade shoe factory's dramatic settlement

158
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,850
- as a first-generation shoe factory in Seongsu. 
 - What the?

159
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:30,150
Get out. Get out. Get out, I said!

160
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,360
Get out. Who told you to come in here? Get out.

161
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,170
Get out, I said! Get out!

162
00:15:35,170 --> 00:15:38,350
   

163
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,860
   

164
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,700
The payment went through today,

165
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:54,070
and they signed the memorandum that says they won't protest.

166
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:55,760
Corporate money works pretty well.

167
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,840
We paid them a lot more than what they'd make with their shoes that don't sell.

168
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:03,420
But one of the shoemakers is still resisting.

169
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,310
The shoemaker union representative.

170
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,350
Looks like he'll show up to protest again today.

171
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,480
What are you going to do?

172
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:20,290
Yu Mi.

173
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:25,190
You should become a team leader when I join  HQ  (Headquarters) , right?

174
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,630
Yes.

175
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:30,340
But...

176
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,810
I'll be the first one to oppose it.

177
00:16:33,810 --> 00:16:35,590
You're not good enough yet.

178
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:39,730
He doesn't care about the money. What am I supposed to do?

179
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,420
The thing that's most precious to him.

180
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:48,050
You need to use that as a weapon against him to negotiate.

181
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,970
She's got such a sharp tongue.

182
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:09,460
What are you doing?

183
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,590
You got scolded again, didn't you?

184
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,610
Don't you find it unfair, Yu Mi?

185
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:27,260
You two joined the company together eight years ago,

186
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,180
and you're a brand marketer too.

187
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:33,610
But you only work as her secretary.

188
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:38,870
I... I'm just sad that you work so hard.

189
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,250
You know how Kang Na Eon is.

190
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,460
She thinks she's all that.

191
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:50,630
Whether it's the people who helped her, teammates, or higher-ups...

192
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:54,600
She abandons them if they're no longer useful.

193
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,960
Yu Mi.

194
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:04,360
I'm just telling you to be careful.

195
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,610
Bye.

196
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,730
F***. Seriously.

197
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:20,200
   

198
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,750
   

199
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,870
Don't come near me! Don't come near me!

200
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:27,670
I want the person in charge. I said I wanted to see the person in charge!

201
00:18:27,670 --> 00:18:30,940
- Calm down. 
 - Ajussi, how many times do we have to tell you?

202
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,220
Don't push, don't push!

203
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,150
I said the landlord signed a rental agreement with us for this property.

204
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,520
Is that why you bribed people?

205
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:41,530
This isn't a place you can buy with little money.

206
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,480
This place means my life and history.

207
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,420
How am I supposed to sell it away?

208
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,610
Bring the person in charge. Get away!

209
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,710
Who the hell are you?

210
00:19:20,710 --> 00:19:23,520
Here I am. I'm the person in charge.

211
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,870
We're not interested in buying it with little money.

212
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:37,270
That's why we compensated all of you with XU's money.

213
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:41,010
- If that's not enough money— 
 - All you ever talk about is money. Money.

214
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,360
Do you think everything can be handled with money?

215
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:50,420
Probably not.

216
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:52,290
But...

217
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:58,790
it might be enough to make your family come back soon.

218
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:08,420
You should buy a good meal for them with the money.

219
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:13,220
I heard that your daughter is dying to see you.

220
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:18,220
Shit. Do you want to die?

221
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,530
Do you really want to die?

222
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,250
Sir!

223
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,870
Sir, no!

224
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:26,890
- What are you doing? 
 - Don't do this.

225
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:27,860
Let go of me.

226
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,140
Let go. I'll kill her. Let go.

227
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:31,680
Let go. Let go.

228
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,740
- Calm down. Calm down. 
 - Let go, I said!

229
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:36,530
Let go, I said!

230
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,830
Eun Ho!

231
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,900
Are you okay?

232
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:47,820
I filmed everything.

233
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,340
Shit.

234
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,050
By chance...

235
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:16,710
Did you plan this whole thing, Sunbae?

236
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:20,500
I didn't know you'd suddenly show up, though.

237
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,450
In any place,

238
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,880
the cost of driving out the long-term tenant is high.

239
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:36,590
XU wouldn't want to compensate all the shoemakers.

240
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:39,610
I needed a weapon to use to negotiate,

241
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:42,690
and you showed up.

242
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:47,160
 This looks like a good place for the pop-up. 

243
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,120
 Also, regarding XU Beauty... 

244
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,810
 There are rumors about how they did not use vegan ingredients, 

245
00:21:52,810 --> 00:21:54,840
 and that they still test on animals. 

246
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,490
 Visit the factory tomorrow. 

247
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:59,790
 Then if I go to the factory and discover something while working hard— 

248
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:03,100
 I really hope you do, okay? 

249
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,170
 You've got oddly good timing. 

250
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:11,310
 It's as if you've been waiting for something to happen. 

251
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:16,860
 Because... the bigger the story... 

252
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,100
 the better. 

253
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:26,310
Congratulations, So Eun Ho.

254
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:31,460
The shoemakers will be compensated justly, thanks to you.

255
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,260
You two.

256
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,670
Help Mr. So Eun Ho.

257
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:39,420
- Okay. 
 - My goodness.

258
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:41,810
How about the testing on rabbits?

259
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,580
How about the animal fat?

260
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,900
We might not be able to correct what's wrong,

261
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,620
but we don't have to go as far as covering things up for them.

262
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,780
When did...

263
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,710
that happen?

264
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:15,900


265
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,150
♫  Just call me "Lady"  ♫

266
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:24,470
   

267
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,700
♫  I just may achieve my dream  ♫

268
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:32,880
♫  Even in the face of challenge and despair  ♫

269
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,670
♫  There's no need to stress  ♫

270
00:23:35,670 --> 00:23:38,760
♫  That's my blue  ♫

271
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:47,150
♫  Just call me "Lady", don't call me "Of yours"  ♫

272
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:55,200
♫  Just call me "Lady", don't call me "Of yours"  ♫

273
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,420
♫  Pointy flat shoes  ♫

274
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:02,150
♫  Worn-out sneakers  ♫

275
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:07,070
♫  Whatever it is, I feel like I can touch the sky  ♫

276
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:12,080
♫  With rising confidence, I'd always love myself  ♫
