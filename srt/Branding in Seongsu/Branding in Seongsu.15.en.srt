(All characters, places, events, and organizations in this drama...)

4
00:00:03,141 --> 00:00:04,301
(are fictitious. Guidelines were followed when using animals.)

5
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:18,534
The handmade shoe factory incident.

6
00:00:19,764 --> 00:00:20,935
The pop-up store.

7
00:00:21,904 --> 00:00:24,705
And even the incident which brought down Nam Yoon Hyuk.

8
00:00:24,744 --> 00:00:25,775
They were all...

9
00:00:26,374 --> 00:00:27,645
done by this guy.

10
00:00:28,244 --> 00:00:29,275
So Eun Ho.

11
00:00:59,344 --> 00:01:00,404
Where are you going?

12
00:01:00,545 --> 00:01:02,044
The one that's behind Do Yoo Mi.

13
00:01:03,414 --> 00:01:05,244
They'll know it was me...

14
00:01:05,384 --> 00:01:07,214
behind the Nam Yoon Hyuk incident.

15
00:01:08,155 --> 00:01:11,315
Is that person calling you?

16
00:01:12,354 --> 00:01:14,824
Calling me even after knowing everything...

17
00:01:17,595 --> 00:01:20,065
Means they really want So Eun Ho.

18
00:01:47,854 --> 00:01:50,354
(So Eun Ho)

19
00:01:58,464 --> 00:01:59,464
Na Eon?

20
00:02:00,735 --> 00:02:03,035
Why are you pressing the bell all of a sudden?

21
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:04,405
Just a moment!

22
00:03:06,505 --> 00:03:07,535
Na Eon!

23
00:03:09,174 --> 00:03:10,234
Kang Na Eon!

00:03:19,514 --> 00:03:21,043

(Branding in Seongsu)

27
00:03:45,074 --> 00:03:47,044
- What's going on? - I'm not sure.

28
00:03:49,215 --> 00:03:50,275
Me?

29
00:03:57,715 --> 00:03:58,755
Hey.

30
00:04:02,794 --> 00:04:03,824
So Eun Ho.

31
00:04:06,764 --> 00:04:08,125
Hey, So Eun Ho!

32
00:04:21,874 --> 00:04:24,075
I thought my head was going to explode. Gosh.

33
00:04:28,955 --> 00:04:31,285
- What? - What is it?

34
00:04:32,385 --> 00:04:33,484
What's wrong with you?

35
00:04:34,354 --> 00:04:37,525
Wait. Hold on a second. This is...

36
00:04:42,635 --> 00:04:45,304
I've seen you somewhere.

37
00:05:18,705 --> 00:05:19,705
So Eun Ho...

38
00:05:21,804 --> 00:05:26,445
is back!

39
00:05:30,674 --> 00:05:32,814
Kang Na Eon! Are you okay?

40
00:05:47,725 --> 00:05:48,765
Cha Jung Woo?

41
00:05:49,564 --> 00:05:50,664
Why here?

42
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:52,835
I just got worried about you.

43
00:05:54,635 --> 00:05:56,804
- Not you but me. - What?

44
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:05,845
Back!

45
00:06:06,785 --> 00:06:07,845
I'm back.

46
00:06:09,314 --> 00:06:10,715
So Eun Ho is back.

47
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:14,984
Gosh. This handsome face.

48
00:06:15,395 --> 00:06:16,994
This sexy body.

49
00:06:17,595 --> 00:06:18,895
They're all back.

50
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:22,934
What is this? Have you gone crazy?

51
00:06:23,664 --> 00:06:26,405
Why are you showing yourself off in front of Director Han?

52
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:35,113
But where am I?

53
00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:36,914
Didn't you come here yourself?

54
00:06:38,984 --> 00:06:41,813
Calling me even after knowing everything...

55
00:06:41,814 --> 00:06:44,155
means they really want So Eun Ho.

56
00:06:49,655 --> 00:06:50,655
It can't be.

57
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:54,095
You're the one who wants me?

58
00:07:08,674 --> 00:07:09,814
What?

59
00:07:12,114 --> 00:07:13,544
I've returned to myself?

60
00:07:17,715 --> 00:07:19,124
Gosh.

61
00:07:20,325 --> 00:07:22,794
I really shouldn't leave you alone.

62
00:07:24,624 --> 00:07:27,025
- I should be with you for a while. - Stop there.

63
00:07:28,124 --> 00:07:29,835
You're still being nosy.

64
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:33,064
But So Eun Ho is allowed?

65
00:07:34,064 --> 00:07:35,803
- He's... - Don't say any nonsense...

66
00:07:35,804 --> 00:07:37,104
that you two are dating.

67
00:07:37,705 --> 00:07:39,275
I won't believe it.

68
00:07:40,145 --> 00:07:42,475
I don't know what he has against you.

69
00:07:42,975 --> 00:07:44,614
But I won't leave you two alone.

70
00:08:03,895 --> 00:08:06,934
(Manager Kang Na Eon)

71
00:08:17,715 --> 00:08:19,515
Why become a fool all of a sudden?

72
00:08:19,814 --> 00:08:23,253
But what's the relationship between you two?

73
00:08:23,254 --> 00:08:25,525
Hey, how can you ask that?

74
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:28,155
Is this some kind of act you're putting on as a fool?

75
00:08:28,794 --> 00:08:30,654
Lowering someone's guard...

76
00:08:30,795 --> 00:08:32,225
and getting what you want.

77
00:08:33,665 --> 00:08:36,965
I do need someone like that.

78
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:39,805
To catch a beast,

79
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:42,104
you need a crazy dog.

80
00:08:44,575 --> 00:08:45,705
I'm not crazy though.

81
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:14,465
Let's stop working and eat some food first.

82
00:09:16,734 --> 00:09:17,774
Cha Jung Woo.

83
00:09:18,744 --> 00:09:20,075
You said you'd help me, right?

84
00:09:21,075 --> 00:09:22,715
Yes. With anything.

85
00:09:23,915 --> 00:09:27,185
Then find out where So Eun Ho is right now.

86
00:09:30,654 --> 00:09:33,484
Why do you need to know where So Eun Ho is?

87
00:09:36,154 --> 00:09:37,195
So Eun Ho?

88
00:09:37,754 --> 00:09:39,194
- Na Eon! - Hey!

89
00:09:39,195 --> 00:09:40,195
Na Eon!

90
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:42,194
- Why won't you answer... - Finally!

91
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:44,534
Our curse has been lifted!

92
00:09:54,945 --> 00:09:55,945
Well,

93
00:09:57,175 --> 00:09:59,114
you were with Cha Jung Woo?

94
00:09:59,945 --> 00:10:02,114
Did I interrupt the two of you?

95
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:03,854
Is that it?

96
00:10:07,585 --> 00:10:08,654
Yes.

97
00:10:09,595 --> 00:10:10,653
A lot.

98
00:10:10,654 --> 00:10:11,695
What?

99
00:10:13,095 --> 00:10:14,364
Has he moved in already?

100
00:10:14,994 --> 00:10:16,065
Right after the change?

101
00:10:19,604 --> 00:10:20,904
How dare you?

102
00:10:22,734 --> 00:10:24,374
How dare you?

103
00:10:24,904 --> 00:10:26,704
How dare you?

104
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:28,945
- I'm your senior. - That's enough.

105
00:10:30,315 --> 00:10:32,144
Let go. Now!

106
00:10:33,945 --> 00:10:34,945
Follow me.

107
00:10:35,915 --> 00:10:38,415
- Who? - You, So Eun Ho.

108
00:10:39,384 --> 00:10:40,784
Oh, Na Eon.

109
00:10:41,354 --> 00:10:44,825
What do you want to do in the room? Wait for me!

110
00:10:45,295 --> 00:10:46,364
Hey.

111
00:10:46,925 --> 00:10:47,965
Hey!

112
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:51,894
Na Eon, what are you trying to do...

113
00:10:54,534 --> 00:10:55,575
What have you done?

114
00:10:55,774 --> 00:10:57,435
How are we back in our bodies?

115
00:10:57,774 --> 00:11:00,045
Well, I want to know that too.

116
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:02,774
Hasn't anything happened before we switched?

117
00:11:03,614 --> 00:11:04,744
No.

118
00:11:05,685 --> 00:11:08,144
Darn it. Why did it have to be just then? It was my chance.

119
00:11:11,514 --> 00:11:13,754
So what did Director Han say?

120
00:11:14,154 --> 00:11:16,594
Say every single word he said...

121
00:11:16,595 --> 00:11:17,595
without leaving anything out.

122
00:11:24,335 --> 00:11:25,835
Don't expect that from me.

123
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:28,874
My grades were awful.

124
00:11:29,404 --> 00:11:31,374
You awful prick.

125
00:11:31,835 --> 00:11:32,845
That was mean.

126
00:11:36,215 --> 00:11:39,545
Still, you'll need me.

127
00:11:40,884 --> 00:11:42,555
Director Han...

128
00:11:42,884 --> 00:11:44,085
asked me to join his line.

129
00:11:45,185 --> 00:11:46,185
And?

130
00:11:47,325 --> 00:11:50,354
I really didn't want to be involved with him.

131
00:11:52,994 --> 00:11:54,425
But I thought about you...

132
00:11:56,134 --> 00:11:57,565
and agreed to accept it.

133
00:12:03,904 --> 00:12:04,975
Well done.

134
00:12:05,104 --> 00:12:06,705
Then why would you hit me?

135
00:12:07,845 --> 00:12:10,445
If Director Han was really involved,

136
00:12:11,144 --> 00:12:13,715
there will be evidence that he tried to kill me.

137
00:12:15,955 --> 00:12:18,154
He isn't that precise with things.

138
00:12:21,624 --> 00:12:23,524
What will you do if I find evidence?

139
00:12:24,854 --> 00:12:26,295
If I join your side,

140
00:12:31,264 --> 00:12:32,504
what do I get?

141
00:12:33,864 --> 00:12:36,504
You not living with Jung Woo?

142
00:12:37,774 --> 00:12:38,974
Do you like me?

143
00:12:38,975 --> 00:12:40,104
Me?

144
00:12:40,504 --> 00:12:42,004
Oh, right.

145
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:44,744
You kissed me first.

146
00:12:48,884 --> 00:12:50,684
That was just a smooch...

147
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:52,754
out of comradeship.

148
00:12:53,585 --> 00:12:54,624
Besides,

149
00:12:54,725 --> 00:12:56,754
you were the one to come in deep.

150
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:07,065
Hold on.

151
00:13:08,935 --> 00:13:11,104
Was that kiss why...

152
00:13:16,715 --> 00:13:18,644
I sort of get it now.

153
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:22,154
What?

154
00:13:24,415 --> 00:13:26,253
- Come here. - What's wrong with you?

155
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:29,494
Living in your body is easier to get to Director Han.

156
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:31,654
I like my body...

157
00:13:34,095 --> 00:13:35,195
better too.

158
00:13:36,534 --> 00:13:38,565
My handsome face and hot body.

159
00:13:39,604 --> 00:13:41,205
I don't want it taken away from me again.

160
00:13:43,874 --> 00:13:44,874
Gosh.

161
00:13:45,845 --> 00:13:48,045
Gosh, that useless jerk.

162
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,984
The guy behind Do Yoo Mi is Director Han?

163
00:14:01,055 --> 00:14:02,225
Then...

164
00:14:09,835 --> 00:14:11,165
That's my spot.

165
00:14:13,705 --> 00:14:15,904
First come first served.

166
00:14:16,305 --> 00:14:18,475
I came into this house first.

167
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:25,143
So Eun Ho. You must've forgotten.

168
00:14:25,144 --> 00:14:27,484
I am your senior.

169
00:14:28,545 --> 00:14:29,555
So what?

170
00:14:30,415 --> 00:14:31,484
"So what?"

171
00:14:34,484 --> 00:14:35,695
Gosh.

172
00:14:37,624 --> 00:14:40,364
- Get up. - If you really like here,

173
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:43,264
why don't you cuddle up with me here?

174
00:14:44,595 --> 00:14:47,903
Wait. Are you interested in men...

175
00:14:47,904 --> 00:14:49,205
and not Kang Na Eon?

176
00:14:49,675 --> 00:14:50,734
Honey.

177
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:54,345
Then I'll sleep with Na Eon.

178
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:56,075
Honey.

179
00:14:56,274 --> 00:14:57,845
- Hey, Na Eon. - Where are you going?

180
00:14:58,114 --> 00:15:00,084
- Honey, where are you going? - Na Eon.

181
00:15:00,085 --> 00:15:01,283
- Hey! - I'm right here.

182
00:15:01,284 --> 00:15:04,085
Hey. Where are you grabbing?

183
00:15:04,315 --> 00:15:06,455
Where are you grabbing?

184
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:23,104
If Director Han was the one who incited murder,

185
00:15:32,215 --> 00:15:34,185
the incident five years ago...

186
00:15:35,315 --> 00:15:37,215
and even him trying to kill me now...

187
00:15:38,654 --> 00:15:39,784
It was all...

188
00:15:41,884 --> 00:15:43,055
you?

189
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:49,565
(Candle Charmant)

190
00:15:50,965 --> 00:15:53,033
Then I will start the presentation...

191
00:15:53,034 --> 00:15:55,534
on Segye International's scented candle brand...

192
00:15:56,305 --> 00:15:57,404
right now.

193
00:15:57,534 --> 00:15:59,445
I love this idea.

194
00:16:03,614 --> 00:16:06,244
The problem is our signature scents.

195
00:16:06,614 --> 00:16:08,545
Where can we get them?

196
00:16:09,915 --> 00:16:11,653
Until the next meeting,

197
00:16:11,654 --> 00:16:13,954
find the signature scent of Charmant.

198
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:15,254
(Intangible Cultural Asset's Home, Cosmetics Farm, Ji Hyung Joon)

199
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:19,893
("Segye International, Scented Candle Idea Stolen")

200
00:16:19,894 --> 00:16:21,165
Who was the one to steal it?

201
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:23,195
Was it us or them?

202
00:16:23,494 --> 00:16:25,494
Did Kang Na Eon...

203
00:16:25,565 --> 00:16:28,003
really not know about those candles?

204
00:16:28,004 --> 00:16:30,003
Is that even a question?

205
00:16:30,004 --> 00:16:31,633
The marketing headquarters...

206
00:16:31,634 --> 00:16:34,045
will find the one responsible for this.

207
00:16:34,545 --> 00:16:35,675
Director Min.

208
00:16:36,114 --> 00:16:38,373
I heard that the Charmant candle branding in question..

209
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:41,013
Was done by Team One in marketing. Is this correct?

210
00:16:41,014 --> 00:16:44,114
The one responsible for this incident...

211
00:16:44,915 --> 00:16:46,754
is me, the director of the headquarters.

212
00:16:47,254 --> 00:16:50,354
Segye Group has decided to stop...

213
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:52,965
the candle project.

214
00:16:55,095 --> 00:16:56,763
After boasting around like that,

215
00:16:56,764 --> 00:16:59,864
you can lose your arms and legs and become crippled in a flash.

216
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:03,504
Just like our CEO.

217
00:17:11,514 --> 00:17:13,684
(Director Han Yi Jae)

218
00:17:13,685 --> 00:17:15,915
Let's see how far you go.

219
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:20,625
If all of this was done by you,

220
00:17:22,455 --> 00:17:23,895
I will...

221
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:27,225
unveil all of the secrets.

222
00:18:00,064 --> 00:18:01,125
Open up.

223
00:18:01,725 --> 00:18:03,294
I know you're inside.

224
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:13,243
Aren't you being too loud?

225
00:18:13,244 --> 00:18:14,544
Why aren't you answering my calls?

226
00:18:15,504 --> 00:18:18,215
What happened with Kang Na Eon and So Eun Ho?

227
00:18:18,744 --> 00:18:20,984
Stop being delusional. I'm busy.

228
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,155
Have I been abandoned?

229
00:18:32,925 --> 00:18:34,965
You should've been nicer.

230
00:18:35,465 --> 00:18:37,665
Just someone who comes and goes whenever asked.

231
00:18:38,135 --> 00:18:40,063
You're acting so hard to get when you can't get anything done.

232
00:18:40,064 --> 00:18:41,165
What else can I do?

233
00:18:42,504 --> 00:18:44,935
If you don't like Underdog,

234
00:18:45,405 --> 00:18:47,705
I can find you a different place.

235
00:18:50,514 --> 00:18:52,415
What if I refuse to stop here?

236
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:00,625
Have you called, sir?

237
00:19:02,284 --> 00:19:03,355
Then I must drag you out.

238
00:19:08,324 --> 00:19:09,334
Let go of me!

239
00:19:10,034 --> 00:19:11,333
I can't leave like this.

240
00:19:11,334 --> 00:19:13,464
Even if I have to reveal your dirty tricks...

241
00:19:13,465 --> 00:19:14,934
Let's not get ugly like this.

242
00:19:14,935 --> 00:19:16,074
Director Han, that darn...

243
00:19:18,105 --> 00:19:19,205
Darn...

244
00:19:21,205 --> 00:19:23,544
The director I love the most in this world.

245
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:27,814
- He has someone else now. - Who?

246
00:19:28,744 --> 00:19:30,484
- That girl? - No.

247
00:19:32,054 --> 00:19:33,155
So Eun Ho.

248
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:37,425
- So Eun Ho. - Yes.

249
00:19:37,725 --> 00:19:39,895
You find it weird too, right?

250
00:19:39,965 --> 00:19:43,533
I don't get who he is to him. He accepted all of his conditions...

251
00:19:43,534 --> 00:19:44,594
All of his conditions?

252
00:19:45,965 --> 00:19:47,034
Like what?

253
00:19:51,205 --> 00:19:52,475
I can't tell you that.

254

(Plant Lounge: Enter a title.)

255
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:21,304

(Can a kiss bring a switch in souls?)

257
00:20:25,675 --> 00:20:27,174
(I have a question.)

258
00:20:27,175 --> 00:20:30,115
Did you happen to wake up in a rich family?

259
00:20:30,945 --> 00:20:33,685
Please live in the real world.

260
00:20:41,754 --> 00:20:44,454
Kissing seems like the only way.

261
00:20:44,455 --> 00:20:45,524
You're fired.

262
00:20:50,935 --> 00:20:52,965
We switched at first.

263
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,705
Do you not want to go back?

264
00:20:59,645 --> 00:21:02,304
Let's do it. Let's kiss.

265
00:21:09,044 --> 00:21:10,984
It didn't work the second time.

266
00:21:11,014 --> 00:21:12,254
I think I'm drunk too.

267
00:21:15,355 --> 00:21:16,895
The third time...

268
00:21:21,725 --> 00:21:23,234
No way.

269
00:21:28,564 --> 00:21:30,875
Must it have to be deep?

270
00:21:35,074 --> 00:21:36,675
Gosh. I don't know.

271
00:21:54,094 --> 00:21:55,494
Why is it so bright?

272
00:23:00,094 --> 00:23:01,125
What was that?

273
00:23:01,564 --> 00:23:03,395
Na Eon!
