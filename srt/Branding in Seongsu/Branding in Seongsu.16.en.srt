00:11:29,526 --> 00:11:31,285
Calm down.

185
00:11:31,626 --> 00:11:34,555
By the way, Ms. Kang is such a cold-hearted person.

186
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:36,766
She was so friendly with you guys...

187
00:11:36,966 --> 00:11:38,596
when she was on Team Underdog.

188
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,194
As soon as she became the manager of Team One,

189
00:11:40,195 --> 00:11:42,866
she gave the Daesungjang project to Underdog.

190
00:11:44,266 --> 00:11:45,935
It means she wants to draw a clear line.

191
00:11:56,545 --> 00:11:59,455
(Request for Branding HQ Motors' Liquid Nitrogen Batteries)

192
00:11:59,555 --> 00:12:02,585
(Team Manager Kang Na Eon)

193
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,055
(Thank you.)

194
00:12:17,935 --> 00:12:19,275
Hello, this is HQ Motors...

195
00:12:19,276 --> 00:12:21,175
This is Kang Na Eon from Seongsu Agency.

196
00:12:21,705 --> 00:12:24,276
I'm in charge of HQ Motors starting from today.

197
00:12:24,575 --> 00:12:27,516
We'd like to make a business agreement after discussing it...

198
00:12:27,616 --> 00:12:29,985
with Director Han in Segye Group.

199
00:12:29,986 --> 00:12:32,285
Is there a reason why I can't work on it?

200
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,655
No. It's not like that.

201
00:12:36,455 --> 00:12:37,455
I'll see you...

202
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,596
in the meeting then.

203
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:41,596
All right. Well...

204
00:12:46,435 --> 00:12:49,106
Seongsu Agency was supposed to work on the HQ Motors project,

205
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,435
but Director Han took the chance?

206
00:12:55,506 --> 00:12:57,776
(Daesungjang)

207
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:05,616
So this is the motel that is popular among couples having affairs?

208
00:13:05,856 --> 00:13:07,485
Hurry up and call Ms. Do.

209
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:08,516
Why is she not coming?

210
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:09,955
I know.

211
00:13:12,325 --> 00:13:13,996
The person you have reached is unavailable.

212
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:15,865
Please leave a message...

213
00:13:15,866 --> 00:13:16,995
- Why? - after the tone.

214
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:18,126
She's not picking up.

215
00:13:18,366 --> 00:13:20,335
- My goodness. - Gosh.

216
00:13:23,905 --> 00:13:25,205
Don't call me.

217
00:13:25,466 --> 00:13:28,275
Oh, my gosh. The world is going crazy.

218
00:13:28,276 --> 00:13:29,545
- I know. - All right.

219
00:13:30,106 --> 00:13:32,246
She's not coming. It might be better for us.

220
00:13:32,976 --> 00:13:35,175
- We got this! - We got this!

221
00:13:35,216 --> 00:13:37,315
Do you think we can do it without Ms. Kang?

222
00:13:38,346 --> 00:13:39,685
You have a good-looking guy like me.

223
00:13:41,055 --> 00:13:42,856
You're so confident.

224
00:13:44,585 --> 00:13:46,455
That's true, but why is it so annoying?

225
00:13:47,496 --> 00:13:48,596
Shall we go then?

226
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,496
Grandma, I'm going to be late today.

227
00:13:53,935 --> 00:13:55,035
Excuse me.

228
00:14:01,705 --> 00:14:03,346
"Seongsu Agency?"

229
00:14:04,876 --> 00:14:05,876
Yes.

230
00:14:07,315 --> 00:14:08,846
She must be crazy.

231
00:14:08,945 --> 00:14:10,445
I told her to sell it.

232
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:14,256
We're not branding it.

233
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:16,856
So just keep walking.

234
00:14:18,256 --> 00:14:20,195
Oh, my gosh. Girl.

235
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,966
I think it's because you don't know.

236
00:14:23,026 --> 00:14:26,164
The recent handmade shoe factory project,

237
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:28,065
Girlish pop-up store,

238
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:31,766
and the mood party this weekend.

239
00:14:31,805 --> 00:14:33,976
We worked on them all.

240
00:14:37,705 --> 00:14:39,346
- Hey. - Come on.

241
00:14:39,815 --> 00:14:42,444
We can make Daesungjang successful.

242
00:14:42,445 --> 00:14:45,955
- It's no joke. Right, Mr. So? - Right.

243
00:14:47,455 --> 00:14:48,486
Well...

244
00:14:50,886 --> 00:14:52,226
(Just say that you're the team manager.)

245
00:14:55,555 --> 00:14:57,126
Yes. So...

246
00:14:57,825 --> 00:14:59,966
even if it's a motel, if you brand it in a different way,

247
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,334
Daesungjang will have an opportunity...

248
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:03,965
to be born again.

249
00:15:03,966 --> 00:15:06,905
- I didn't ask, and I'm not curious. - Hey.

250
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,445
Hey.

251
00:15:26,396 --> 00:15:29,266
We should take a look as we received a request.

252
00:15:29,665 --> 00:15:32,435
I don't care that you don't want to be bothered.

253
00:15:32,695 --> 00:15:34,465
Whether you take a look or not,

254
00:15:34,466 --> 00:15:36,535
I don't care.

255
00:15:41,205 --> 00:15:43,376
I don't care about the princess limited edition.

256
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:45,174
- I don't... - I don't care...

257
00:15:45,175 --> 00:15:46,615
about the cordless vacuum.

258
00:15:46,616 --> 00:15:48,146
Even with the free electric shaver.

259
00:15:48,476 --> 00:15:51,085
- No. - No, I don't.

260
00:15:51,346 --> 00:15:53,385
It's annoying, isn't it? You're mad, aren't you?

261
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,356
But you can't do anything, can you?

262
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:06,636
This is so annoying.

263
00:16:08,396 --> 00:16:09,935
I don't care about this darn old inn.

264
00:16:17,405 --> 00:16:19,216
Jenny, our superstar.

265
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:22,516
She can be useful sometimes.

266
00:16:25,616 --> 00:16:27,685
Did you see that?

267
00:16:31,026 --> 00:16:33,496
Why is it so scary?

268
00:16:34,955 --> 00:16:36,466
Even ghosts won't come,

269
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:38,526
not to mention couples having affairs.

270
00:16:40,035 --> 00:16:41,866
Do you want to go first?

271
00:16:42,236 --> 00:16:45,976
- What? Me? - Yes. You go first.

272
00:16:50,646 --> 00:16:51,846
The smell.

273
00:16:52,106 --> 00:16:55,345
Even 100 air fresheners will not remove this smell.

274
00:16:55,346 --> 00:16:56,846
- Wait. - What's wrong?

275
00:16:57,246 --> 00:16:58,346
It's so dark.

276
00:16:58,415 --> 00:16:59,756
This is spooky.

277
00:17:00,785 --> 00:17:02,656
Let's hurry up and go. I'm so scared.

278
00:17:13,135 --> 00:17:16,006
- Why? - Why?

279
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:20,506
- Hey. - It's a clock.

280
00:17:20,605 --> 00:17:21,635
Oh, my gosh.

281
00:17:21,736 --> 00:17:24,406
It's so scary to be in the back. I can't do this. I'm serious.

282
00:17:31,486 --> 00:17:34,756
Her mouth is so big.

283
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:37,156
What's going on?

284
00:17:37,325 --> 00:17:38,656
Oh, my.

285
00:17:45,726 --> 00:17:47,196
There are so many people wanted by the police.

286
00:17:47,696 --> 00:17:48,996
Are there that many criminals?

287
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:50,265
Jenny, you should go first.

288
00:17:50,266 --> 00:17:52,064
No!

289
00:17:52,065 --> 00:17:53,634
I'm going to quit.

290
00:17:53,635 --> 00:17:56,746
I'm really going to write a letter of resignment!

291
00:17:59,105 --> 00:18:01,446
It's a tricycle.

292
00:18:01,976 --> 00:18:03,486
Why are you doing this?

293
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:08,186
The door is open.

294
00:18:09,885 --> 00:18:13,325
Why is there only one door open?

295
00:18:13,395 --> 00:18:14,925
But...

296
00:18:14,926 --> 00:18:16,426
we should look around the room as well.

297
00:18:16,865 --> 00:18:19,026
- No. - No.

298
00:18:19,936 --> 00:18:21,766
Darn it.

299
00:18:43,785 --> 00:18:46,656
- Why? - What is it?

300
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:49,465
A cockroach!

301
00:18:49,466 --> 00:18:51,166
You scared the cockroach more.

302
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:53,065
It's not a big deal.

303
00:19:01,736 --> 00:19:04,305
I did wrong.

304
00:19:10,885 --> 00:19:12,585
So...

305
00:19:13,656 --> 00:19:15,085
you made a request...

306
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:18,026
because you wanted to change the motel.

307
00:19:20,026 --> 00:19:21,926
I did make a request,

308
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:25,325
but I don't want to change it.

309
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:32,166
Oh, my. What do you mean, girl?

310
00:19:32,335 --> 00:19:34,176
We'll completely change it.

311
00:19:34,206 --> 00:19:35,575
In Lex style.

312
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:37,676
I said I didn't want to change it.

313
00:19:39,276 --> 00:19:43,445
But you made a request, so we...

314
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:44,916
Don't change it!

315
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:49,055
Get out. Get out right now!

316
00:19:56,595 --> 00:19:59,666
A different person is in charge now.

317
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:02,365
We're in an awkward situation.

318
00:20:04,406 --> 00:20:06,835
You requested of Seongsu Agency from the beginning.

319
00:20:07,736 --> 00:20:09,304
That's true, but...

320
00:20:09,305 --> 00:20:12,206
Seongsu Agency and Segye Group are the same company.

321
00:20:12,575 --> 00:20:14,415
You should assign the project after discussing with the other employees.

322
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,446
I...

323
00:20:18,516 --> 00:20:20,855
want to work on this project so badly.

324
00:20:22,156 --> 00:20:23,385
I must do it.

325
00:20:26,156 --> 00:20:27,294
(Daesungjang)

326
00:20:27,295 --> 00:20:29,156
Gosh, it was unbelievable.

327
00:20:30,266 --> 00:20:32,666
We received a request, but she told us to do nothing.

328
00:20:32,966 --> 00:20:34,034
And she kicked us out.

329
00:20:34,035 --> 00:20:35,436
Tell me about it.

330
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,436
Did you see how she changed completely?

331
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:39,635
I thought she was Ms. Kang.

332
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:41,206
Her face completely changed.

333
00:20:41,676 --> 00:20:43,375
"Underdog should act like Underdog."

334
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:45,845
"Get out. Get out right now."

335
00:20:46,516 --> 00:20:47,545
I don't like it.

336
00:20:49,845 --> 00:20:51,446
What do we do now?

337
00:21:01,496 --> 00:21:03,266
I'll talk to her again.

338
00:21:04,865 --> 00:21:05,895
What are you going to say?

339
00:21:27,686 --> 00:21:30,986
(So Eun Ho)

340
00:21:37,365 --> 00:21:40,335
Ms. Kang, you're still stubborn.

341
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:43,406
I heard you changed recently.

342
00:21:44,105 --> 00:21:46,075
I'm back to my usual self.

343
00:22:07,555 --> 00:22:08,625
Ms. Kang.

344
00:22:08,956 --> 00:22:10,696
- Ms. Kang. - Are you okay, Ms. Kang?

345
00:23:05,045 --> 00:23:06,156
Sweetheart.

346
00:23:07,216 --> 00:23:09,726
Are you okay, sweetheart?

347
00:23:10,325 --> 00:23:11,355
"Sweetheart?"

348
00:23:14,256 --> 00:23:16,365
What's the matter?

349
00:23:17,325 --> 00:23:18,965
You were inside for a long time.

350
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:21,535
I thought an old lady ghost took you.

351
00:23:21,766 --> 00:23:23,065
I was worried.

352
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:25,635
- "An old lady ghost?" - Yes.

353
00:23:26,236 --> 00:23:28,436
What is it? Is it perhaps...

354
00:23:29,545 --> 00:23:31,206
Darn it. Again?

355
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:32,875
"Again?"

356
00:23:34,976 --> 00:23:36,544
Why? What are you talking about?

357
00:23:36,545 --> 00:23:37,746
(Security camera in use)

358
00:23:37,845 --> 00:23:39,085
What's the matter, sweetheart?

359
00:23:42,285 --> 00:23:44,285
It happens at all times. What do they want me to do?

360
00:23:46,156 --> 00:23:48,196
Sweetheart, are you all right?

361
00:23:49,026 --> 00:23:50,966
Let's call it a day and go home.

362
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,966
Nothing is sorted out.

363
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:55,766
I told you to go home.

364
00:23:56,305 --> 00:23:59,134
You said you wanted to try it. Why are you mad?

365
00:23:59,135 --> 00:24:00,176
What's wrong with you?

366
00:24:00,236 --> 00:24:02,435
Let's go home for today.

367
00:24:02,436 --> 00:24:04,874
What on earth do you want me to do? Let go of me.

368
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,915
- No. Let's go. - That's not what I'm saying.

369
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:08,516
- Don't. - Go home.

370
00:24:21,595 --> 00:24:24,395
I'll accept it as a yes and look forward to it then.

371
00:24:27,236 --> 00:24:28,335
Director Han?

372
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,634
(I can tell you what I know under conditions.)

373
00:24:31,635 --> 00:24:33,305
I can tell you what I know...

374
00:24:33,906 --> 00:24:35,276
under conditions.

375
00:24:39,045 --> 00:24:40,145
Son Eun Ho wants something...

376
00:24:41,676 --> 00:24:43,645
from Director Han?

377
00:24:58,565 --> 00:24:59,736
Is this place...

378
00:25:00,996 --> 00:25:04,206
HQ Motors.

379
00:25:06,276 --> 00:25:07,736
Are you okay?

380
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:09,375
"Motors?"

381
00:25:10,605 --> 00:25:11,805
What are your conditions?

382
00:25:13,276 --> 00:25:16,285
I think it's not fun to just let you know.

383
00:25:16,845 --> 00:25:21,016
The HQ Motors project Kang Na Eon wants to work on.

384
00:25:21,956 --> 00:25:23,926
Make it canceled. That's my condition.

385
00:25:25,855 --> 00:25:27,196
Ms. Kang, it seems...

386
00:25:27,456 --> 00:25:30,265
you're under the weather today. So go home and rest.

387
00:25:30,266 --> 00:25:31,266
No.

388
00:25:39,736 --> 00:25:40,875
HQ Motors.

389
00:25:43,446 --> 00:25:44,446
I will not do it.

390
00:25:52,246 --> 00:25:53,656
Beat Kang Na Eon...

391
00:25:54,516 --> 00:25:56,355
and become the youngest team manager.

392
00:25:57,385 --> 00:25:58,426
How about that?

393
00:26:02,926 --> 00:26:04,766
I can tell by your eyes.

394
00:26:05,526 --> 00:26:07,135
Deep inside,

395
00:26:07,736 --> 00:26:09,805
your heart is full of hidden desires.

396
00:26:15,075 --> 00:26:17,176
Don't worry. I'll give you bullets.

397
00:26:18,575 --> 00:26:20,716
The bullets that can get Kang Na Eon.

398
00:26:21,545 --> 00:26:22,716
Everything...

399
00:26:24,845 --> 00:26:25,916
about her.

400
00:26:31,156 --> 00:26:32,526
What if I want something else?

401
00:26:37,625 --> 00:26:38,666
The truth.

402
00:26:43,065 --> 00:26:44,065
The truth about that day...

403
00:26:46,006 --> 00:26:47,176
five years ago.

404
00:26:52,206 --> 00:26:54,815
