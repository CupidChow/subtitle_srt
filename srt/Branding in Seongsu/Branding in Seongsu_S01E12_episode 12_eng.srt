1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,360
   

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,430
Have us compete in a presentation.

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:12,810
Hey, what are you doing right now?

4
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,250
- Who are you? 
 - I'm So Eun Ho, the new marketer.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,820
You're new, but you're very ambitious.

6
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:26,840
Why don't you do the presentation, then?

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:29,040
What should we do with Segye Soju?

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,970
Should we fold or not?

9
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:33,370
Why don't you fold?

10
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:35,040
What?

11
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:37,190
Hey.

12
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:40,600
Hey, what are you... What are you doing...

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,140
He came prepared. My gosh.

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,680
- That's— 
 - Gosh, he's sexy.

15
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,400
Last year, each adult consumed 53 bottles of soju.

16
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:54,170
That's the equivalent of 397 glasses.

17
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,340
Last year, 2.29 billion bottles of soju were sold.

18
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,180
But the total amount of soju consumed was only 20%

19
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,670
of all alcohol consumption.

20
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,460
The market share of Segye Soju, which launched last year,

21
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,610
was merely 4%.

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,560
This year's sales are presumed to be negative 120% compared to last year.

23
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,980
At this rate, next year's market share is presumed to...

24
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,470
drop near 2%.

25
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:22,010
That's why you should fold.

26
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,920
Hey, are you crazy?

27
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,410
You have a point.

28
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:34,010
But that's your destiny when you jump into the red ocean late.

29
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,460
I jumped in knowing I'd be destroyed by the competitors.

30
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,530
Why? Why? Because I'm sincere about wanting to protect Korea's soju.

31
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,890
I'm against wine and whiskey and stuff like that dominating our market.

32
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,940
Liquor equals soju.

33
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:53,250
Sincerity. Passion.

34
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,880
Stuff like that can't just become an excuse for losers.

35
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,290
I think our sexy monster is trying to sabotage Team 1.

36
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,520
Yes.

37
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,900
So?

38
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:12,150
You want me to fold... no matter what?

39
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:16,950
Fold and... move on to the next game.

40
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:21,540
   

41
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,790
Replay?

42
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,020
By doing a premium relaunching,

43
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:34,080
we'll give Segye Soju a new life and make it a top brand.

44
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,160
That's... a very aggressive suggestion.

45
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,750
Okay, then.

46
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,540
Thanks for sharing, Team 1.

47
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:49,950
Shall we hear from Team Leader Kang since we're having a competition?

48
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:51,730
Pardon?

49
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:55,950
Well, I-I...

50
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,250
No, no. Not Team Leader Kang.

51
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,580
Who's the youngest... in this team?

52
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,600
Hey, hey.

53
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,950
- Pardon? 
 - It's only fair this way.

54
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,660
I'm not really sure since I don't drink.

55
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:17,610
Our youngest team member...

56
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,020
How old are you?

57
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,710
- I'm 20 years old. 
 - I see.

58
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,370
Are you a special high school recruit?

59
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:25,870
Pardon?

60
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,320
You know...

61
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:35,770
I am not curious if our special post-high school recruit drinks or not.

62
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:39,470
Why don't you understand the point of my question?

63
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,370
Is it because you're a high school graduate?

64
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:44,250
Director, what you said just now is a bit—

65
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:49,310
Wow, looking closely. There's no way you could compete with Team 1.

66
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,220
Ahjumma.

67
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,500
- Gay. 
 - My gosh.

68
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,430
And a high school graduate?

69
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:56,060
You're going too far, Sir.

70
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,530
I'm too understanding, more like.

71
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,510
I'm thinking of giving you a bonus point since you're handicapped.

72
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,480
We don't need bonus points right now—

73
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,490
You old geezer with stinky feet!

74
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,380
Put some socks on!

75
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,110
Gosh, Jenny.

76
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,140
- Jenny! 
 - My gosh, Jenny!

77
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,470
What?

78
00:04:18,020 --> 00:04:20,040
I thought the MZ generation was strong.

79
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,400
Is this really something to cry over?

80
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,310
What's your opinion as a fellow member of the MZ generation?

81
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,520
I know.

82
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,420
Is this really... something to cry over?

83
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,760
Right?

84
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:42,670
Prepare presentations on how to make Segye Soju the No. 1 brand in the industry

85
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,190
by Thursday.

86
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:46,550
The winning team will get the award necklace.

87
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,170
Let's kill it.

88
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,580
Fighting.

89
00:04:54,060 --> 00:05:01,950


90
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,310
   

91
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,180
   

92
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,830
   

93
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,330
   

94
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,660
   

95
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:31,810
   

96
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,150
My gosh, your makeup is all ruined.

97
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,970
Stop crying, stop.

98
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,420
Jenny, you should be more understanding since you're so nice.

99
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:44,040
Why should I be understanding?

100
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,790
It's all that bastard's fault.

101
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:53,710
I'll post on social media that I was bullied at work!

102
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,450
Gosh, don't do that. Please.

103
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:58,060
That'd only hurt you, okay?

104
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,750
Ahjumma, whose side are you on?

105
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,980
All you do is pretend to care. You damn hag.

106
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,350
- No, no. 
 - "Ahjumma"?

107
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,020
Didn't you hear what she said?

108
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,270
- Hey, do you think I'm your friend? 
 - Come on.

109
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:17,390
I might look young, but I'm at least 20 years older than you, you brat.

110
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,120
Look young, my foot!

111
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,460
You look at least 30 years older.

112
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,840
You're so annoying!

113
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,130
- Gosh... 
 - Hey, Jenny! Where are you going, Jenny?

114
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:30,770
Geez, that little brat!

115
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:32,920
The kids these days...

116
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,840
Seriously!

117
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,650
- Team Leader. 
 - Yes?

118
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:41,720
Do you think I look 20, I mean, 30 years older than her?

119
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,960
What's the use of fighting each other?

120
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:48,120
When our enemy is right there!

121
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,780
Mr. So Eun Ho!

122
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,480
What?

123
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,280
We need to talk for a second.

124
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,690
Why are you suddenly doing this?

125
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,290
I don't know what you're thinking,

126
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:29,100
but you could've just teamed up with Yu Mi sunbae by yourself.

127
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,110
Why are you dragging us into it too?

128
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,800
What's so bad about giving the Underdog Team a chance to work on a project?

129
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,450
- Sunbae! 
 - What?

130
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:44,180
Couldn't you have told me if you had plans like this?

131
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,130
You couldn't even do that between us?

132
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,730
Between us?

133
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,120
What are we?

134
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,090
We are...

135
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,840
We are... We are...

136
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,820
What are we?

137
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,880
Well...

138
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,320
   

139
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:13,730
Yes, I'll be there by seven.

140
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,880
See you later, Noona.

141
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,860
"Noona"?

142
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:25,290
I'll start dating Cha Jeong Woo too then!

143
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:29,060
Seriously, what's wrong with her?

144
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,880
Okay. Branding 101. Let's start with the marketing research.

145
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:00,630
One is mean and the other is clueless.

146
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:02,460
I know, right.

147
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,210
   

148
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,600
Gosh, seriously. The Girlish Pop-up ended less than a week ago.

149
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,350
Do we have to do this?

150
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,440
I have a show tonight, too.

151
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:15,380
I agree. I'm against doing overtime.

152
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,020
We're against it!

153
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:21,450
Okay, okay, okay. We at least need to come together for Jenny,.

154
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,730
Jenny? I don't want to do this even more because of her.

155
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,490
She seriously hurt my feelings.

156
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,700
Come on, don't be like that, Yeong Ae.

157
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,690
Okay, okay. Let's go, let's go! Let's go...

158
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,910
Let's just go home.

159
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,980
   

160
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,550
   

161
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,290
   

162
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,680
   

163
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,300
I just confirmed this.

164
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,610
Segye Soju is the least popular one.

165
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,330
- I see... 
 - We'll have another naengmyeon  (cold noodles in broth) .

166
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,640
- Should we clank glasses first, then? 
 - Geez...

167
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,280
Cheers.

168
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,420
Take your time.

169
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,720
Gosh, it's bitter. Segye Soju is definitely the most bitter.

170
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,380
No way. Princess, you can tell the difference?

171
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,860
My gosh, Unni. Of course. I'm basically a sommelier.

172
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,860
Look at this.

173
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,930
Just Like the Last Time has a bit of sourness to it.

174
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,340
   

175
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:20,340
And Salty Dew is a bit sweet toward the end.

176
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,600
   

177
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,660
But I only drink Seonro is Good Soju these days.

178
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,700
This is the cleanest one. 
    

179
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,220
So, each soju tastes different?

180
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,770
Of course.

181
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,540
You're lying.

182
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,750
Close your eyes. Give me a break...

183
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:40,210
Unni, have you always been lied to? Come on.

184
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:43,780
You think I wouldn't know? Shuffle them properly.

185
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,620
Open your eyes.

186
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,330
Let's go.

187
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:03,490
You little trickster. You can't fool my tongue.

188
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,990
This is Segye Soju.

189
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:07,500
Daebak.

190
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,680
- Wrong. 
 - What?

191
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,810
That was Seonro is Good Soju, okay?

192
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,220
What? You're lying.

193
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,580
Seonro Is Good Soju can't be this bad. You're wrong.

194
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:23,370
Looks like it's difficult for most people to tell them apart by taste.

195
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,450
Why is it not popular, then?

196
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:28,950
- Please give us a bottle of soju. 
 - There has to be a reason.

197
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,380
   

198
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,770
He ordered Segye Soju.

199
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,050
You're right. This is exactly a 4% market share.

200
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,000
Should we ask him why he got Segye Soju?

201
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,890
Shall we?

202
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,810
What?

203
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,870
You scared me. What are you doing?

204
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,120
One, two, three.

205
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,980
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

206
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:54,060
We're doing marketing research on the liquor market.

207
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,800
You ordered Segye Soju.

208
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,900
We were wondering why you decided to order it.

209
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,620
Segye Soju?

210
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:03,330
Geez, what's the deal?

211
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:07,360
Excuse me. You gave me the leftover one just because I asked for any of them?

212
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,570
I'll get you a Dew instead, then.

213
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,110
Gosh, it's packed.

214
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,590
The inventory is piling up.

215
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:24,390
We're screwed. Totally screwed.

216
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:37,230
   

217
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,980
I'm surprised.

218
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:47,350
I didn't think you'd ever see me again with your ego.

219
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,390
I'm not the one who wanted to see you.

220
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,060
Is that so?

221
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,260
I don't know who it is, but they're rude.

222
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,640
Did he pick this up from Na Eon?

223
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,050
What's taking so long?

224
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,650
Oh, right...

225
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:11,070
The one who wanted to see you was Na Eon's boyfriend—

226
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:19,140
There he comes.

227
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:30,720
So Eun Ho.

228
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,350
Over here.

229
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:38,040
You can't come this late after asking me to arrange a meeting.

230
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,240
I guess he's not interested in working with me.

231
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,080
I am... interested.

232
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,720
Okay, this is So Eun Ho.

233
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,330
He's a new hire at Seongsu Agency.

234
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:51,070
I live with Team Leader Kang Na Eon.

235
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,610
I thought that'd be a more efficient introduction.

236
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:02,600
What are you suggesting right now?

237
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,700
I'm suggesting you work with me.

238
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:12,000
We'll relaunch Segye Soju.

239
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,930
As your personal liquor brand, Mr. Nam Yun Hyeok.

240
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:18,250
Hey, you can't just say that without explaining.

241
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:23,980
A foreign whiskey brand asked me to be their exclusive model.

242
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,580
Even if you relaunched it,

243
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,820
I won't let you use my face for an unknown geezer soju brand.

244
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,400
Three hundred million won.

245
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,770
If 300 million isn't enough...

246
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,270
- 500 million. 
 - Are you joking right now?

247
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:43,020
Looks like you're trying to copy Kang Na Eon.

248
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,590
You can't hire anyone you want just because you'll pay them.

249
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:48,020
I'm not saying we'd pay you.

250
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,300
I'm telling you to pay us.

251
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:57,090
- What? 
 - I know that's still going on.

252
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:00,650
The thing Na Eon covered up for you earlier this year.

253
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:05,670
We'll keep that a secret and let you model the relaunch for 500 million.

254
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,790
Hey, you think I'm easy because you're close to Kang Na Eon?

255
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,980
Seriously, what are you two doing?

256
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,920
Hey, So Eun Ho. You went too far, too.

257
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,490
Of course, you're easy.

258
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:18,260
You get intimidated and act like a dog since you can't handle Kang Na Eon.

259
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:22,520
- Are you serious, you asshole? 
 - Aren't we all here for the same reason?

260
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,460
To overthrow Kang Na Eon.

261
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,350
I heard you're Kang Na Eon's boyfriend.

262
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,640
You're taking your lovers' quarrel too far.

263
00:15:47,570 --> 00:15:50,850
Can you really defeat Kang Na Eon?

264
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:55,420
I'm...

265
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,330
actually...

266
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,830
pretty strong.

267
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:38,360
I don't play losing games.

268
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,420
I'm not interested in losing, either.

269
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,750
Geez, this asshole...

270
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,200
Geez.

271
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,010
By the way...

272
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,070
you oddly look familiar.

273
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:25,780
Really?

274
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:31,270
The way you look at me as if I'm worthless.

275
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:36,700
It's exactly like Kang Na Eon...

276
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,700
What's that?

277
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,140
   

278
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,570
Hey.

279
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,290
C-Can we really do this?

280
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,080
Nam Yun Hyeok...

281
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:09,530
has no way out anyway.

282
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,890
How about you? Are you okay, So Eun Ho?

283
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:30,210
Hey, So Eun Ho!

284
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,490
Hey!

285
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:33,380
Hey, So Eun Ho!

286
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,260
Hey!

287
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,630
Hey!

288
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:43,490
We're just getting started. Just getting started. Fighting!

289
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:47,020
Let's get drunk quickly since we're stressed out.

290
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,540
Sounds good. My gosh! You're boosting Segye Soju's sales on your own. Seriously.

291
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:57,920
- You're unbelievable. 
 - To be honest, I don't get why people drink.

292
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,280
Wy are you so bad at drinking when you're a working professional, Team Leader?

293
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,920
That's no good!

294
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:08,320
You're very enthusiastic about this project.

295
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,120
Let's stay enthusiastic. Don't back down.

296
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,660
Don't back down!

297
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,860
Don't back down.

298
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,140
Gosh, what's this?

299
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:24,620
It's all about not being shy about drinking.

300
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,370
Come here. Here, here. Drink up.

301
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,240
Come on, come on. Drink up.

302
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,050
Gosh, Princess. Princess!

303
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:33,460
- Drink up. Gosh, good job. 
 - It's too much for her.

304
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,040
She's drinking just fine.

305
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,780
This is why I drink soju.

306
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:41,220
- It's tasty. 
 - Oh? Wait!

307
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,260
I want to go there.

308
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:50,690
Oh? Isn't that Jenny?

309
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:52,580
Jenny?

310
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:56,860
A man? He looks quite a bit older, by the way.

311
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,600
She quit because she was offended. Now she's drinking?

312
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,600
- Geez. 
 - Really.

313
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,240
Seriously.

314
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:16,020
I can see why the taxi driver didn't want to come up here.

315
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,110
Gosh, seriously...

316
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,070
Hey, So Eun Ho. That's it, right?

317
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:27,700
Please say it is!

318
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,290
Gosh, you're so freaking heavy. Seriously!

319
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,960
Okay, okay, okay.

320
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,500
Hey, come on now. When did they take these?

321
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,430
 Team Leader Kang is so cute when she's drunk. 

322
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:54,160
 I'll post this on social media. 

323
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:57,140
 Tell me your ID so I can tag you. 

324
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,930
Geez. 
    

325
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:12,220
Really? You're not answering?

326
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:17,600
Shit, the battery.

327
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,310
What?

328
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,630
What was that? I'm scared.

329
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:39,820
Shit. I should go home.

330
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,080
Who's there?

331
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,250
S-Someone was there. What was that?

332
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,700
Shit.

333
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,350
Gosh, who was that?

334
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,890
Who's over there?

335
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:09,210
I-I saw you j-just now.

336
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,480
Y-You're underestimating me because I'm a woman, right?

337
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,070
I-I'm not just a woman, okay?

338
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:24,550
T-There's something incredible within me.

339
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:27,140
Come out! Where are you?

340
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:42,290
Jeong Woo Sunbae?

341
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,440
"Jeong Woo Sunbae"?

342
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,390
I-I mean, Mr. Cha Jeong Woo?

343
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,480
Mr. Cha?

344
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,360
Hey, hey, your shoes!

345
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,800
The bed...

346
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,930
You're driving me crazy.

347
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,090
Gosh, I'm tired.

348
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,890
Shit.

349
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,230
This doesn't suit him at all.

350
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,200
Gosh, seriously.

351
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,870
What?

352
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:06,410
What?

353
00:24:06,410 --> 00:24:10,810
I mean, I noticed your hand on mine.

354
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,550
Geez.

355
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,320
Gosh, that reaction makes me feel so sad.

356
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,180
It can't be that bad...

357
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,110
Don't be sad about that. We're men—

358
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:24,940
What?

359
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:29,080
I mean, we're bosom buddies.

360
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,050
"B-Bosom buddies"?

361
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,090
Well, best friends. Best friends.

362
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:40,150
Why do I want to take the subway so badly? I'm off.

363
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,950
Hold on.

364
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,670
I went to the hospital every day.

365
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:53,370
Before you woke up and afterward.

366
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:56,450
I was really heartbroken.

367
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,260
That nobody, So Eun Ho, acted like he was your guardian.

368
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:03,770
Why couldn't I even be your guardian?

369
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,940
Is it him?

370
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,480
The one giving you a hard time?

371
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,200
It's none of your business.

372
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:52,010
Are you and So Eun Ho serious?

373
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:56,560
- That's— 
 - Even though...

374
00:25:57,990 --> 00:26:00,380
I liked you longer than he did?

375
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,660
What?

376
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,400
Don't go.

377
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:27,840


378
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:38,600
   

379
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,870
♫  I'll have no regrets in this moment  ♫

380
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:47,200
♫  Will you lean in and whisper to me softly please  ♫

381
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:54,130
♫  The beginning of all of my seasons becomes clearer because of you  ♫

382
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:58,610
♫  Can you spare me just a glance?  ♫

383
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:01,800
♫  I'm pouring my heart out  ♫

384
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,660
♫  It's within me now  ♫

385
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:14,120
♫  The last entry in my diary  ♫

386
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:19,340
♫  That final period I couldn't write down honestly  ♫

387
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:22,050
♫  Honestly...  ♫
