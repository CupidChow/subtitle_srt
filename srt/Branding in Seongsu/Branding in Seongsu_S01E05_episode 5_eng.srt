1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,680
   

2
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:42,720


3
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:48,010
 What? 

4
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,900
 So Eun Ho? 

5
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:56,730
 What happened to my body? 

6
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,460
Dr. Kwon! Mr. So Eun Ho woke up!

7
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,610
Mr. So, are you okay?

8
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:14,100
Mr. So.

9
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,920
Do you feel awake?

10
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,280
Why am I So Eun Ho?

11
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,730
What happened?

12
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:23,350
You had a heart attack.

13
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:26,530
- Thankfully, someone called 119— 
 - Not him, me. 
  (TN: 119 is equivalent to 911 in the US.) 

14
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,990
Kang Na Eon.

15
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,670
Pardon?

16
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:31,620
What happened to Kang Na Eon?

17
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,810
Well, a woman named Kang Na Eon was sent here on the same night and she's in the ICU.

18
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,600
Nurse Jeong, you didn't have to bring that up.

19
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,570
- Sir. Sir, Sir. 
 - Mr. So!

20
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:44,750
- Mr. So! Where are you going? 
 - Sir, Sir, Sir!

21
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,670
   

22
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:03,510
- Where are you going? You can't go in there! 
 - Sir, Sir!

23
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:05,850
You can't come in here.

24
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,010
- Where are you going? 
 - Go back to the ward.

25
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,310
 That night... 

26
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,700
 Kang Na Eon died. 

27
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,980
   

28
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,700
   

29
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,560
   

30
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,060
   

31
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,430
   

32
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:33,390
   

33
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,390
   

34
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,720
 It could've been dangerous for you too. 

35
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,020
The CT and MRI scan appeared normal,

36
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,840
but you were unconscious for a month.

37
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,450
What about Kang Na Eon?

38
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:45,550
As I said, unless you're a guardian—

39
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,650
She doesn't have a family.

40
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:52,350
- That's more the reason— 
 - Chlordia... zepoxide  (TN: A prescription sedative used to treat anxiety and alcohol withdrawal symptoms.) 

41
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:54,480
You must know since you're her doctor.

42
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,380
She's been getting it through this hospital without a prescription.

43
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,500
Are you threatening me?

44
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:08,290
It means I'm her only guardian.

45
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:23,270
Even if you were, all I can do is give you her belongings.

46
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,570
Soul change.

47
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,220
 I think my soul was transferred when I woke up. 

48
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,240
 Is this possible? 

49
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,430
 Were you at a Chaebol family house when you woke up? 

50
00:04:40,430 --> 00:04:43,210
 Please live the reality, not fiction. 

51
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,550
   

52
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,870
 The police concluded the falling accident of Kang, who was in charge of the XU Beauty incident, 

53
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:54,830
 was a suicide attempt due to a personal situation. In the month since the accident 

54
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:57,370
 - What? Suicide? 
 - there has been no sign of foul play, so they will stop investigating. 

55
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:02,750
 They assumed her dismissal due to the incident was the main reason for the suicide attempt. 

56
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:08,940
 The criticism that was focused on Kang is now directed toward Seongsu Agency. 

57
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,480
Of course. It's not the employee's fault.

58
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,960
She must have done what the company told her to do.

59
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,560
It was my fault...

60
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,890
for underestimating the ones who hated me.

61
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,700
What are you talking about?

62
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,570
   

63
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:31,300
   

64
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,500
   

65
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,140
   

66
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,880
 What? 

67
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,100
 Someone called in a report using my phone? 

68
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,300
You can't.

69
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:48,200
I'm the boyfriend of Kang Na Eon in the penthouse.

70
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,230
Dozens of people come here and insist they were her boyfriend daily.

71
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,000
This is nothing.

72
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,070
Shit. It's so f***ing high up.

73
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,590
   

74
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,000
Son of a bitch.

75
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,830
   

76
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,190
This is it.

77
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,550
What's all this?

78
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,350
A lock?

79
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,820
0524?

80
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,720
   

81
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:54,220
Seven. Six.

82
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,880
Five.

83
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:06,090
It can't be.

84
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,250
What's with him?

85
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,470
He has a pretty well defined design concept.

86
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:22,620
Who wears stuff like this?

87
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,670
Look at this.

88
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,360
 It wasn't a crime of passion. 

89
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,450
 it was definitely... 

90
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:57,140
A planned murder by the ones who held a grudge.

91
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:24,370
 Do you think money can fix everything? 

92
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:26,790
 Was it the shoemaker then? 

93
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,800
 If it were someone even closer to me... 

94
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,020
 Do you think you're somebody? 

95
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,050
 Team Leader Nam? 

96
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,000
 I'll be the first one to kill her! 

97
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,020
 Do Yu Mi? 

98
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:47,300
 - Director Han? 
 - You've been through a lot. 

99
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:51,430
 Or... 

100
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:53,100
 A detective stopped by. 

101
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,110
 They asked about you. 

102
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:59,860
 They said they found you near the handmade shoe factory that night. 

103
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,930
 Am I being considered a suspect too? 

104
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,350
 So Eun Ho? 

105
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,040
 You? 

106
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,680
 No way. 

107
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:30,910
Is it a power outage or something?

108
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:41,510
Nothing seems to be wrong with So Eun Ho.

109
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,860
I don't know.

110
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,800
Geez, he smells good for no reason.

111
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,970
Of course, I didn't sleep well.

112
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,630
Shit.

113
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:57,330
This body has something good about it.

114
00:13:04,350 --> 00:13:05,870
What's all this?

115
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,840
Wow, this bastard is basically an old man.

116
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,800
My gosh. My gosh.

117
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,410
What's this?

118
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,980
What is he... a member of the national team?

119
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,770
 Is that really Eun Ho? 

120
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:49,780
 His appearance changed so much, I almost didn't recognize him. 

121
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,290
 Can he leave the hospital already? 

122
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:54,800
 Does he know he was transferred to the underdog team? 

123
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:09,330
   

124
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:13,260
   

125
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,300
 Do Yu Mi? How interesting. 

126
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,190
Thank you so much.

127
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:23,610
- Thank you. 
 - Thank you.

128
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:29,690
As soon as they released Team Leader Kang's investigation results? Daebak.

129
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:33,510
There was a reason why her entire team was transferred to the Underdog Team.

130
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,610
They said they'd rather quit than join the Underdog Team.

131
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:37,840
They all quit apparently.

132
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,710
Really?

133
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,380
Except for him. 
    

134
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:48,200
Why would they rather quit than join the Underdog Team?

135
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:51,980
Because you can't even add that to your resume—

136
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,330
I should stay here forever, then.

137
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,640
Let's go out.

138
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,010
Let's have a meeting outside.

139
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:06,690
She's our team member. Please take good care of her.

140
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,170
I'm going to HQ to get the letter of appointment.

141
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:12,070
Are you coming with me?

142
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:26,260
You're Na Eon's intern boyfriend.

143
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,350
I heard you were sent to the hospital together that day.

144
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:31,890
Were you two actually dating?

145
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,350
What happened?

146
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,110
What do you mean?

147
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:42,060
Did you do that to Kang Na Eon?

148
00:15:47,610 --> 00:15:50,100
I wanted to, but...

149
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,490
she ended up that way on her own.

150
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,410
It's too bad.

151
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,940
You think you're somebody since you were hired full-time.

152
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:02,120
Stop talking to me casually and start sucking up to the right person.

153
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,990
   

154
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,680
- You can go out now. 
 - Pardon?

155
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,060
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

156
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,000
Hello?

157
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,130
I don't have to worry about Kang Na Eon, right?

158
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:04,710
That would be bad.

159
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:07,060
If she comes back alive,

160
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,410
you and I are over, too.

161
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,480
Keep that in mind.

162
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,020
 How did Do Yu Mi become the team leader of Marketing Team 1? 

163
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,480
I know, right.

164
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,470
Isn't the leader of Team 1 considered a high position?

165
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,780
Seongsu Agency's number one.

166
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:38,030
Yes. It's a first-class ticket to becoming an executive at Segye Group's HQ.

167
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:44,660
But Do Yu Mi took that position as soon as Team Leader Kang's investigation results came out?

168
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,430
That's so strange, isn't it?

169
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,860
As if someone planned it.

170
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,100
- Wow. Wow! 
 - Whoa.

171
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:57,290
You sound so cool now that you've gone full-time.

172
00:17:57,290 --> 00:18:00,510
- But I feel guilty for some reason. 
 - Why?

173
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:03,830
I said he's Underdog material.

174
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,940
I think I caused it by saying that.

175
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:08,760
Did you tell him such a thing?

176
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,690
He has a good eye for people.

177
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,330
What's he saying?

178
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,790
He's still not well.

179
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:21,430
Hyung, joining the Underdog Team means

180
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:24,230
So Eun Ho's starting line for his career

181
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:28,150
is being pushed back all the way there.

182
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,430
This is no good. Let me teach you in advance.

183
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,710
Yes.

184
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:36,190
Underdog Team's A to Z.

185
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,030
First of all...

186
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:41,310
Lee Yeong Ae sunbaenim, she's been there 15 years.

187
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:47,980
 She steals the agency's electricity. She's the little thief of Seongsu Agency. 

188
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,510
   

189
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,270
 We let her take the supplies since she has a lot kids but, 

190
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:56,130
 Who's back there? 

191
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,900
 she even stole the event gifts too. 

192
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,800
 Who are you? 

193
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:06,230
 So, she was sentenced to life in the Underdog Team. 

194
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,640
 Joo Rex sunbaenim has been on the team for five years. 

195
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,760
   

196
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,600
 He has a male body, but the soul of a goddess. 

197
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,820
 Rumor has it that he works at a drag queen bar as a side job. 

198
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:23,980
 It's f***ing lame to criticize someone based on their sexual preference or lifestyle these days, 

199
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:27,780
 but he should dress appropriately for client meetings. 

200
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,910
 That's right. 

201
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:32,190
 That's why he was sent to the Underdog Team. 

202
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:35,530
Hi! H! I!

203
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:37,640
 The last one. Park Je Ni sunbae. 

204
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,610
 She was hired while she was in high school. She's been there for a year. 

205
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:43,080
 She was hired for her unique personality, but... 

206
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:45,680
 I'm giving a presentation. Can you focus? 

207
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:48,470
 Who does stuff like this these days? 

208
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,950
 Gyaru. I'm the No. 1 cutie. 

209
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,250
 Do you want to play with me? I like pretty ones. 

210
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,380
 She filmed a social media challenge during a meeting. 

211
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:02,300
 I'll get so many views if we film all together! 

212
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:07,650
Team Leader got so furious she sent her to the Underdog Team.

213
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,390
Gyaru. 
  (A Japanese subculture and fashion style inspired in part by American 90s hip-hop culture.) 

214
00:20:09,390 --> 00:20:11,700
 I know better than anyone. 

215
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,760
 Because I sent all of them there. 

216
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,770
 I like pretty ones. Something like this? 

217
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:20,880
 I'll get so many views if we film all together! 

218
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,350
 Hey! 

219
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,700
 Why are they doing this? My gosh. 

220
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,840
 - Don't do this at work. My gosh. 
 - Rex. 

221
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,680
 Oh, my. 

222
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:38,460
 Losers. 

223
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,460
Hyung?

224
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:46,040
- Hyung, where are you going? 
 - Where are you going?

225
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,570
 The accident involving Kang, the person in charge of 

226
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:53,470
 XU Beauty's controversial incident was concluded without an arrest. 

227
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:56,010
- I don't care if the team members are useless. 
  - As a result, 

228
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:58,660
 the future of the handmade shoe company that was planned to be bought out 

229
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,130
 will be reconsidered as well. 

230
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:03,110
 The owner of the handmade shoe factory stated 

231
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,110
 that it was impossible to make a profit with the factory.  

232
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:09,330
 They said it would be difficult to revive the factory. 

233
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,030
 What I want to find out is... 

234
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:19,340
 who dared to try to kill me. 

235
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,760
   

236
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:37,060
I can sit and pee. Sit and pee.

237
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,520
   

238
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,940
   

239
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:58,660
Let's hear from Team Leader Do Yu Mi of Marketing Team 1.

240
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:03,620
Although Na Eon ended up that way,

241
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:08,400
we should let bygones be bygones.

242
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:12,210
I'll take responsibility

243
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:16,950
and work hard to improve Seongsu Agency even more.

244
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,020
Thank you.

245
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:23,870
- What a beautiful friendship. 
 - I know.

246
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:26,500
Her looks aren't too bad.

247
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,060
Right?

248
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,180
Rumors are rampant due to the rushed personnel shakeup.

249
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:33,330
But...

250
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:38,340
I think it's quieter than the incident from five years ago.

251
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,620
I'll work hard.

252
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,960
- Good luck. 
 - I'll work really hard. Thank you.

253
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,090
You came.

254
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,910
Na Eon isn't even here.

255
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:57,690
I know. She should've been here with me.

256
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:01,020
Looks like you think she'll come back alive.

257
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,970
You're way too optimistic.

258
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:08,410
Because you're insisting on being negative.

259
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:13,330
I'm the one who has to clean up her shit at the handmade shoe factory.

260
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,280
How could I not be negative?

261
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,480
Why argue with an old lady with no power?

262
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,060
Oh, also, the Underdog Team.

263
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,600
Shouldn't we get rid of it?

264
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,960
Yes, you're right.

265
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,810
It's not like they can have their own project.

266
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:40,250
They aren't bringing any results.

267
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,250
 Framing. 

268
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:48,040
 A marketing strategy that uses a frame to create a distorted view of a phenomenon. 

269
00:23:49,270 --> 00:23:52,460
 Let's use this trendy protein drink as an example. 

270
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:55,390
 The competitor's product has 20g of protein, 

271
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:58,060
 but ours has 21g. 

272
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:02,380
 We have to treat protein like it's gold 

273
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:06,380
 and make the 1g difference appear huge 

274
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:10,990
 making the public favor us naturally. 

275
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:16,450
 Making them believe they determined who the winner and loser are on their own is... 

276
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,400
 called “framing.” 

277
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:25,080
No.

278
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:30,300
The reason they exist is because they don't bring any results.

279
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,330
   

280
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:38,160
   

281
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,090
You came?

282
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:11,210
You know this is a crime, right?

283
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,810
I didn't take them myself.

284
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,200
Is it a crime to look at them, too?

285
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:19,270
Stealing someone else's position...

286
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:21,420
is definitely a crime.

287
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,140
You're flipping out defending Na Eon.

288
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,210
There really must have been something between you two as the rumor says.

289
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:31,230
Did you sleep together?

290
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:36,260
I think it's more your style to do things like that.

291
00:25:39,650 --> 00:25:41,790
Who did you sleep with?

292
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,800
By the way, you do know that Kang Na Eon fired you, right?

293
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,340
- I know it too well. 
 - How about the fact I made you a full-time Underdog?

294
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,640
I know that too.

295
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,270
   

296
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:58,660
Do you want to return the favor then?

297
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,260
Why don't you clean up the shit... 
    

298
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,460
your dear girlfriend left?

299
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:05,690
   

300
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,340
I know about this too.

301
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:14,180
Hey, So Eun Ho.

302
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:21,030
The entire Underdog Team should report in at the weekly meeting this week.

303
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,300
All right.

304
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:27,040
Team Leader of Team 1.

305
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:37,930
Shit. That asshole.

306
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,490
   

307
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:52,090
   

308
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:09,410
   

309
00:27:09,410 --> 00:27:11,930
   

310
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,400
 Do you want to die? 

311
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:23,690
 Do you really want to die? 

312
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,980
What are you doing?

313
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:53,990


314
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:59,130
   

315
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:01,300
♫  Not someone's so-and-so  ♫

316
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,400
♫  Don't call me "Of yours"  ♫

317
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,550
♫  I just may achieve my dream  ♫

318
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:10,890
♫  I'm driven by pain, even in the face of challenge and despair  ♫

319
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,570
♫  There's no need to stress  ♫

320
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:16,320
♫  That's my blue  ♫

321
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:24,900
♫  Just call me “Lady,” don't call me ”Of Yours”  ♫

322
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:33,000
♫  Just call me “Lady,” don't call me ”Of Yours”  ♫

323
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,360
♫  Pointy flat shoes  ♫

324
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,950
♫  Worn-out sneakers  ♫
