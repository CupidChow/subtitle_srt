1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:07,390
   

2
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:15,250
Sunbae, what's all this?

3
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,740
What the...

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,140
They erased their tracks.

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,450
The best way they know how.

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,040
This is totally crazy.

7
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:27,590
Let's hand this over to the police right now.

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,530
I'll meet him in person.

9
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:34,350
No.

10
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,790
I can't put you in danger.

11
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,080
Why would I be in danger?

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,600
I have you by my side now.

13
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:08,610


14
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,050
 The masked rabbit who tried to kill me was Cha Jeong Woo. 

15
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,770
 In that case... 

16
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,460
   

17
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,590
   

18
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,040
   

19
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,510
   

20
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,790
   

21
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:02,860
   

22
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,960
   

23
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,510
I have tons of editing to do other than this.

24
00:02:09,510 --> 00:02:14,030
How about you guys help me...

25
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:15,420
 Nope. 

26
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,430
You need to be good at editing photos to become a good designer.

27
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,900
The legend says Team Leader Cha edited out 200 people when he was a newbie.

28
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:26,900
Should I sneak these over to Team Leader Cha then?

29
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,020
Look how the MZ's today act.

30
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,020
You'll make your team leader edit photos?

31
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:35,330
What's wrong with that? I should help if a team member needs help.

32
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,170
Team Leader.

33
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:43,600
There are so many people on the edge and in the background. I can't do it.

34
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:49,170
Try to think of it as drawing in the background instead of removing people.

35
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,000
It's difficult to make it totally empty,

36
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,390
but it's fun to create something new.

37
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,480
The background...

38
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,880
Excuse me.

39
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,570
- Go ahead and create something new. 
 - There you go.

40
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,610
 - Cha Jeong Woo.  
 - Hey, Na Eon.

41
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,310
 You'll be coming to the alumni gathering, right? 

42
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,360
   

43
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,510
What a pretty wedding invitation. Congratulations.

44
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,370
Thank you. This is why classmates are the best.

45
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:19,830
Are you seeing anyone, Yu Mi?

46
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,320
Me?

47
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:25,840
I'm always the same, you know.

48
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,320
- How about Na Eon? 
 - I have a boyfriend.

49
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,060
What? Really?

50
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,710
Yes. He works at the same company and team.

51
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:37,310
His name is So Eun Ho.

52
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,570
Who's So Eun Ho?

53
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:52,850
♫  All of a sudden, you're the hero of my story, I'll celebrate our love  ♫

54
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,210
- See you then. 
 - Okay.

55
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:57,430
- Make sure to come. 
 - Okay.

56
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:06,140
Hey, Cha Jeong Woo, do you want to go to Da Hyeon's wedding with me?

57
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,250
Why do you like me?

58
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,200
I'm not sure.

59
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,560
 Sunbae, where are you right now? 

60
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,930
 You're okay, right? 

61
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,750
   

62
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:41,540
I'm sure he'll make a move.

63
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,060
Don't worry.

64
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,100
When something's dangerous, it means—

65
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,940
there will be...

66
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,290
a big reward, too.

67
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,530
You came.

68
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:22,780
You came sooner than I thought.

69
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,830
Go ahead and try again.

70
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,190
You...

71
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,580
already tried to kill me.

72
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:53,290
What's this? Is this all you got?

73
00:05:53,290 --> 00:05:54,950
Bring it on.

74
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,940
Don't you have the guts?

75
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,980
Were you not trying to kill me?

76
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,020
Were trying to take me?

77
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,090
Sunbae!

78
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,620
Are you okay, Sunbae?

79
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:32,970
Stop now...

80
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:39,110
Cha Jeong Woo.

81
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,080
When did you find out?

82
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,030
I found this in the art office.

83
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,010
If you...

84
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,760
had given me a chance, this wouldn't have happened.

85
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,370
Just one.

86
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,080
Really?

87
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,440
Are you sure this happened because I didn't give you a chance?

88
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:25,710
No. The Cha Jeong Woo I know isn't this kind of a person.

89
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:31,810
You wouldn't be ruined like this just because you couldn't have me.

90
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,900
Who is it?

91
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,950
Who made you this way?

92
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,070
I already know so go ahead and tell me.

93
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:02,050
She said you would only come to me if you hit rock bottom and were ruined.

94
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,910
That's why I only threatened you.

95
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:07,880
So, I'm asking who said that.

96
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,530
   

97
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:15,610
People say Na Eon resembles me.

98
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,990
But that's not true.

99
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:24,900
The one who resembles me the most is you, Yu Mi.

100
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:36,070
I think...

101
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,300
we could become great partners.

102
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,830
Is it Min Hee Jeong?

103
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,060
But still, that's too...

104
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:10,840
Na Eon could get hurt.

105
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,670
What if you just let things go are they are

106
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,240
and Na Eon becomes someone you can never have?

107
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,770
What would you do then?

108
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,270
Just scare her a little bit.

109
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:32,140
And you can show up like a savior, as if it was meant to be.

110
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,740
But this doesn't make any sense.

111
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:39,640
Make her realize she belongs by your side, Team Leader Cha.

112
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:47,680
So...

113
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,700
you believed it when Min Hee Jeong said you could have me if I hit rock bottom

114
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,530
and...

115
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,300
you tried to kill me.

116
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,080
I swear I didn't try to kill you.

117
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,700
Believe me.

118
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,290
I don't need apologies or excuses.

119
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:16,650
I can't believe you fell for her tricks.

120
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,610
I'm a fool for thinking you were my friend.

121
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,010
Get out.

122
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:31,020
Sunbae,

123
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,850
you don't know what he will do if you let him go like this.

124
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,090
He wouldn't have done this...

125
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,060
if he had the guts to do anything more.

126
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:03,310
Are you sure this is okay?

127
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:08,020
Yes, if he's still the Cha Jeong Woo I know.

128
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:17,130
 Here's breaking news. 

129
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:21,000
 As the rumor about Segye Group's Director Hwang Jae Ha having a child out of wedlock spread, 

130
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:24,930
- Hwang Jae Ha? 
  - Segye International stock prices are starting to drop. 

131
00:11:24,930 --> 00:11:25,700
Sunbae.

132
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,970
- What are they saying? 
  - Segye Group hasn't released a statement regarding the rumor, but 

133
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:36,020
 countless women are coming forward insisting they're his mistress.  
  

134
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,200
 

135
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,990
 It just so happens...  
  

136
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:54,030
 that Hwang Jae Ha's scandal comes out now? 

137
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:58,540
 Just like how it happened five years ago. 

138
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,250
Her method...

139
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,280
hasn't changed at all.

140
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,330
   

141
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,090
Oh, my God.

142
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:22,160
I have a child out of wedlock? I am innocent.

143
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,250
I'm sure someone did this on purpose.

144
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,730
Release a statement immediately saying it's not true.

145
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:30,770
No one will believe the rumor.

146
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:33,810
- What? 
 - Whether it's true or not,

147
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,580
no one will care. That's what I'm saying.

148
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:41,180
Your public image was already tossed out like prey

149
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,600
and the media is already feeding off it.

150
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,930
Yes, that's true. That's true.

151
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,540
By the way,

152
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,260
this is very similar to what happened five years ago.

153
00:12:58,090 --> 00:13:01,520
   

154
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:07,470
Director Min, you know that I'm innocent.

155
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:12,260
The public doesn't care whether it's true or not.

156
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,350
They just need to be entertained.

157
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:20,010
The only thing that can cover up one scandal is another that is more entertaining.

158
00:13:22,550 --> 00:13:27,540
Let me take care of it. But under one condition.

159
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:35,900
I'll create a scandal that's even more controversial than this one.

160
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,270
Get rid of HQ Marketing using that news.

161
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:44,770
And then, after some time passes and things settle down,

162
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:49,230
let it quietly return.

163
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:57,950
And I hope to get a higher position than my current one then.

164
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:04,030
Just scare her a little bit.

165
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,870
   

166
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:13,830
 - Hurry up! 
 - Please call 119. 

167
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,930
 Are you okay, Da Eun? 

168
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:30,700
The public was freaking out because of me

169
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:33,330
and you saved me.

170
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:38,280
The public is now freaking out again,

171
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,730
and you're trying to save me.

172
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:51,360
Gosh! Life as an emperor. It's too stressful, isn't it?

173
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,300
I'll make sure your image recovers properly this time

174
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:58,670
so you don't get sucked into a disgraceful scandal again.

175
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,200
Okay.

176
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:05,260
Director Min, did the meeting go well?

177
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,750
How are you planning to resolve the current scandal?

178
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,100
- I'm the one who spread that rumor. 
 - Pardon?

179
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:18,090
It gives me a chance to cover it up with a bigger scandal.

180
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,580
Watch and learn, Yu Mi.

181
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:29,060
See how I get rid of the ones who get in my way.

182
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:49,650
 You need to have what the other person needs in order to get what you want. 

183
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:53,260
 Min Hee Jeong. 

184
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:57,520
 What you need the most now is... 

185
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,200
   

186
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,210
The brands that Director Hwang was in charge of...

187
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,760
Did you come up with rebranding ideas for them?

188
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,170
But Team Leader, you didn't give us enough time...

189
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:25,370
I collected all the information on Director Hwang from the moment he was born.

190
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,020
I collected information on all the brands he ruined.

191
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:35,620
Jenny collected all of his social media and internet usage history.

192
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:40,240
And here are snacks, since we'll be staying up all night.

193
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,620
Let's start digging into Director Hwang properly.

194
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,570
By the way Team Leader, we still don't understand.

195
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:56,810
Yes. We don't know what would happen to these brands because of him. Why should we—

196
00:16:56,810 --> 00:17:01,900
I'm sure we'll need them one day.

197
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,460
Okay.

198
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,710
You're working hard.

199
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,020
Hello.

200
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,990
You don't have to work so hard.

201
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:31,380
   

202
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,020
- What's this -
 - As for the reason for dismissal...

203
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,390
you'll hear it on the news soon.

204
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:46,300
But this isn't the end.

205
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,350
It's the beginning.

206
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:54,520
I won't stop now. I'll make sure you hit rock bottom.

207
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,190
What a relief.

208
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,910
I wasn't...

209
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,720
going to let you get away with it either.

210
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,420
   

211
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:39,730
Hello, I'm Seongsu Agency's marketing team employee, Do Yu Mi.

212
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:46,570
While working with Team Leader Kang Na Eon,

213
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:49,370
she abused her power regarding work

214
00:18:49,370 --> 00:18:55,560
and forced me to offer bribes to the clients.

215
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:02,670
 After the press conference with a Seongsu Agency's whistleblower regarding 

216
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:04,360
 Team Leader Kang Na Eon's bribery, 

217
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:07,700
 the public is focused on how Segye Group will resolve the issue. 

218
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:10,430
 Segye Group immediately dismissed Team Leader Kang  

219
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:15,770
 and stated they'll reimburse the victims while investigating. 

220
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,960
I get that Team 1 was short-lived.

221
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,560
But what nonsense is this? 
    

222
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,960
Instagram and Twitter are exploding right now.

223
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:26,170
The clients are insisting on canceling their contracts too.

224
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,940
Good day. Where's Ms. Kang Na Eon's office?

225
00:19:32,690 --> 00:19:33,980
- My gosh, my gosh. 
 - What do we do?

226
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,320
They must've come to arrest her.

227
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,720
Well, it's up there...

228
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,770
My gosh, they're coming up. Gosh, they're coming.

229
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,570
Hide first. Hide, hide.

230
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,520
Ms. Kang Na Eon?

231
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,210
Please come with us to the police station.

232
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,910
How could this happen?

233
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,400
What did our team leader do?

234
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:04,480
The Team Leader has a really bad personality, but she wouldn't do something like that.

235
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,740
Do you think you should be saying that now?

236
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:10,160
You can be kind of prickly, don't you think?

237
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:14,470
I'll be right back.

238
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,690
- Team Leader. 
 - What are we supposed to do?

239
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,380
I've done nothing wrong.

240
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,890
I'm sure the world will find this out too.

241
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,640
Let's go.

242
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,550
Team Leader.

243
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,250
   

244
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:40,490
 According to the police, they started investigating Team Leader Kang Na Eon. 
   

245
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:45,200
 The police are focusing on Team Leader Kang's bribery accusation brought up 

246
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,080
 by a whistleblower at Segye Group. 
   

247
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,910
 They also stated they're planning to re-investigate 
   

248
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:52,260
 the XU scandal from last September as well. 
   

249
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,560
 Regarding Team Leader Kang's police investigation, 
   

250
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:57,630
 Segye Group stated the case has no connection to them. 
   

251
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:02,210
 Their statement will likely jeopardize Team Leader Kang even more. 
   

252
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:04,610
   

253
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:17,620
 Director Min, we caught So Eun Ho. 

254
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,300
They confiscated his recorder and phone.

255
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,220
It's just as you expected.

256
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,000
Sunbae.

257
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,820
Are you really on her side?

258
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:56,220
I didn't think you were that bad.

259
00:21:56,220 --> 00:22:01,470
No matter how clever Kang Na Eon is, she's still under my thumb.

260
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:04,150
What should I do?

261
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,040
Eliminate him.

262
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:14,520
She said she had a plan. Why isn't she coming back?

263
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:19,630
Team Leader Kang got arrested and I can't reach Eun Ho honey.

264
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,650
What are we supposed to do?

265
00:22:21,650 --> 00:22:24,650
What are we going to do?

266
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:28,890
Honey! Let me see your face.

267
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:32,070
Her face is a mess. Honey, go grab a concealer.

268
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,650
Get your act together.

269
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:36,430
Is the rebranding presentation I mentioned ready?

270
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,520
Of course.

271
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,470
Why work on a presentation in this situation? 
    

272
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,990
I don't know what you're thinking.

273
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,430
Let's go now.

274
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:51,460
Let's prepare the last presentation.

275
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,310
You're going to get kidnapped?

276
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:01,470
 Kidnapping in this day and age? 

277
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:08,330
 So, since Director Min must have gotten rid of the evidence from the past, 

278
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:12,690
 we'll get her to commit a new crime and get fresh evidence? 

279
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,790
 This is totally a sting operation. 

280
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:17,110
 This is so freaking fun. 

281
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,690
 Bingo. 

282
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:27,610


283
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:30,480
   

284
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:35,460
♫  Walk steadily just like as Rocky  ♫

285
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:38,090
♫  The windy road doesn't affect me at all  ♫

286
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,780
