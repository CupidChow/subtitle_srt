1
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:07,270
   

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,590
Guardian?

3
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,830
Who says you're her guardian?

4
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,890
I say so.

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:27,030
- I'm her boyfriend. 
 - Hey.

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,110
If you pretend to be her boyfriend again,

7
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,910
I won't just let it go.

8
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:36,800
The same goes for you.

9
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:42,070
Why didn't you do anything when Kang Na Eon

10
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,000
ended up in the hospital and had her position taken away?

11
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:52,750
Did you... just want to sleep with Na Eon?

12
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,080
You're out of your mind.

13
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,430
Or... did you want her to end up that way?

14
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,740
Hey, you bastard!

15
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,240
I struggled over this more than anyone.

16
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,570
She was hurt at the pop-up event we worked on together.

17
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:14,150
In the water tank I designed...

18
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:17,060
Na Eon...

19
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:24,750


20
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,360
   

21
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,150
   

22
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,850
   

23
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,320
   

24
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,780
   

25
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:54,810
   

26
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,070
 Cha Jeong Woo. 

27
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,140
 It could have been him considering the wound on his hand but... 
   

28
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,820
   

29
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,200
 his motive isn't strong enough. 

30
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,520
   

31
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,880
 Actually, the prime suspect is... 

32
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:17,900
 the one who would benefit the most from me being gone. 

33
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:20,630
 Do Yu Mi. 
   

34
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,490
   

35
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,900
 But she couldn't have done it alone. 
   

36
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,020
 If she had an accomplice... 
   

37
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:31,050
 Team Leader Nam? 
   

38
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,960
 That bastard isn't capable enough. 
   

39
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,050
 Director Han. 
   

40
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:43,090
 But he's not someone who would do the dirty work himself. 
   

41
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,580
   

42
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,270
 There isn't enough evidence to determine the culprit.  
    

43
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:52,150
   

44
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,870
 Who's the one who called 119 then? 

45
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,050
   

46
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,530
 Who else was at the crime scene... 

47
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,150
 at the time that night? 

48
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,190
   

49
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,120
   

50
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,910
Are you working on the additional files for the presentation?

51
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,240
   

52
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:38,520
I'm not interested in apologizing, even if you're angry about yesterday.

53
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,060
   

54
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,260
Be like that then.

55
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,300
Wait, Eun Ho. What's wrong is wrong.

56
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,640
You did say something mean.

57
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,380
I know. You don't know how hurt Rex was.

58
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,820
I thought you pledged to remain silent.

59
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,780
I think you came to work less than 10 minutes ago.

60
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,240
See? See? He always talks so cruelly.

61
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,130
I know. Since you talked so cruelly,

62
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:13,810
Rex got angry and said what he wanted to say.

63
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:21,650
You'd feel more comfortable without me then.

64
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,230
Will you really keep acting like this?

65
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:27,540
Where are you going, Eun Ho?

66
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:21,610
 He suddenly showed up from there. 

67
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,500
 While running up the staircase... 

68
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,870
 The phone... 

69
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,610
 This stain is... 

70
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:10,870
 It was on the shoemaker's knife too. 

71
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,780
 What if this is the glow-in-the-dark paint we used at the pop-up? 

72
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,840
Could it be...

73
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,230
 The same glow-in-the-dark paint... 

74
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:50,360
 was found on the shoemaker's knife? 

75
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,840
 The owner of this knife... 

76
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:20,690
 was there... that night. 

77
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,960
Those EX sons of bitches.

78
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,710
Hyungnim, are you drunk?

79
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,520
It's XU. XU.

80
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,920
That's enough, please.

81
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,610
Hyungnim! If we sold out sooner when other people

82
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:49,540
wanted it, we would have at least gotten paid properly.

83
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:54,490
Exactly! Are we supposed to make shoes forever?

84
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,990
No one even wears them.

85
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,720
Geez, seriously.

86
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,790
Where are you going?

87
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:09,780
Hey, you can't keep putting it on your tab.

88
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,700
Here we go again.

89
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,640
I'll pay.

90
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,560
I tried to kill Kang Na Eon,

91
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,210
is that what you want to hear? Is that why you keep doing this?

92
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:41,610
I don't know if you tried to kill her...

93
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:19,090
but I came here to hear you say

94
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,600
you were there that night.

95
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:27,320
Kang Na Eon.

96
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,000
You called 119 for her didn't you?

97
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,380
 This is my theory. 

98
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,150
 The night Kang Na Eon got into the accident, 

99
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:49,480
 there were two people at the scene. 

100
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:54,200
 The one who called 119 and the culprit. 

101
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:15,630
 You happened to find Kang Na Eon there on the night of the accident. 

102
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,440
 Using the shoemaking knife you had, 

103
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,500
 you saved 

104
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:43,640
 Kang Na Eon. 

105
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,940
 Yes, this is 119. 

106
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,800
 Yes, there's someone... 

107
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,350
 You hated her enough to want to kill her. 

108
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,680
She would have died if you had just left her.

109
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,740
Why did you save her?

110
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,490
Were you scared?

111
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:28,450
Why did I save her?

112
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:34,500
A person was dying. Do you need more reasons?

113
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,690
Kang Na Eon...

114
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:43,900
We think the bitch deserves to die.

115
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,150
Of course, I wanted to kill her.

116
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,450
I hated her enough to think about it.

117
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,750
But I can't actually...

118
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:55,630
kill someone because of that.

119
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:11,260
Thinking about it now, she was right about everything.

120
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:16,650
A person died, and the landlord was freaking out.

121
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:21,280
And all the employees left. Shit.

122
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,100
I should have quit a long time ago.

123
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,290
But I didn't want to admit it.

124
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,000
That no one...

125
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,670
cares about handmade shoes anymore.

126
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,250
 You're not allowed to read and ignore. 

127
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:01,490
 A male body with the soul of a goddess? 

128
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,010
 Doing drag queen shows is my hobby. 

129
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:07,550
 Are you from the HR department or something? 

130
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,130
 You can't fire someone for having two jobs. Don't you know? 

131
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:22,160
A male body with the soul of a goddess.

132
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,810
Let's change the concept.

133
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:29,270
What?

134
00:13:29,270 --> 00:13:34,150
It's not necessary to be loved by everyone.

135
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,870
He read it and is ignoring it again. Again.

136
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,270
I might end up with only one job after this.

137
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:52,720
I don't believe pathological liars.

138
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:59,010
Why aren't there heels in size 280? My poor babies.

139
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:06,600
Honey, all the show venues in Itaewon are closing nowadays too.

140
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,000
- You'd starve if you quit your day job.
- I'd rather starve.

141
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,220
I don't know if I can keep working there.

142
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,500
Honey...

143
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,710
Gosh, gosh, gosh. The customers are looking good today.

144
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:28,160
Wait, wait. I need to see it, too. My gosh.

145
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,700
♫  It's over, baby  ♫

146
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,310
♫  It's over, baby  ♫

147
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:04,360
Can you drink stuff like this before the show?

148
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:09,550
Gosh, look how flirtatious you are.

149
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:12,080
Get out of here if you're here to apologize.

150
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,510
I won't accept your apology.

151
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,480
I came to deliver a present rather than apologize.

152
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,120
Princess.

153
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,120
What's your shoe size?

154
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,760
Oh, my gosh, excuse me!

155
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,370
Hello. Please wait just a moment.

156
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,930
Yes, come on in. Come on in. Excuse me.

157
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,730
I'm so sick of this. Please just...

158
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,750
Gosh, you're so noisy.

159
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:46,680
- You've done so much. 
 - You've done even more, Unni.

160
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,900
Gosh, this is daebak.

161
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,680
- The lighting isn't great. 
 - Please be gentle.

162
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:53,850
It tickles.

163
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,090
- Just put up with it, girl. 
 - Gosh! So ticklish!

164
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,560
I'm taking the best photo of your life.

165
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,820
Gyaru.

166
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,100
- Not bad, right? 
 - You can relax.

167
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,550
Which one should I post?

168
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:10,710
Oppa, my grandma only wore handmade shoes.

169
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:14,610
That's why her granddaughter's doing it, too. Did you hear that? Gosh.

170
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,070
How firm.

171
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:20,010
Stop flirting, girl.

172
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,920
- Please wait a moment. 
 - Honey, he's firm, too.

173
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,430
Gosh, you must work out, Oppa. I know you're busy.

174
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,340
Just one moment.

175
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,790
You're cute.

176
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:32,300
Which one should I post?

177
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:35,380
I think that jerk scored big.

178
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,850
But we're just losers anyway.

179
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:41,370
Gosh, I'm getting angry again.

180
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,110
- You're not losers. 
 - Oh, my gosh!

181
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,650
It's too late now.

182
00:16:46,650 --> 00:16:49,670
It's a bit too late to say that.

183
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,580
I mean, I almost said that.

184
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:57,600
We need to destroy that kind of label.

185
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:01,960
 Let's walk together in handmade shoes. 

186
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,020
 The handmade shoe factory's grand transformation! 

187
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:07,580
 Coming soon! 

188
00:17:10,550 --> 00:17:14,040
 Oh, my gosh! So excited! 

189
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:24,790
Wow, look, look.

190
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,540
 Over here! 

191
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:30,830
 Love it! 

192

Stop working, Honey.

00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,720
- See you tomorrow. 
 - Stop working. Stop working.

202
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:51,130
- Stop being late. 
 - You're always late.

203
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,650
- Hi, hi. 
 - Why are you so late?

204
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:54,980
I came straight from work.

229
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,280
Isn't this the handmade shoe factory?

230
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,190
- Wow. 
 - What an amazing branding.

231
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,600
Are you kidding?

232

- Wow. 
 - Daebak.

236
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:24,160
Rex Unni looks amazing.

237
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:28,070
- Eun Ho must've learned a lot from Team Leader Kang. 
 - Seriously.

238
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:30,090
Team Leader who?

239
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:36,330
Was Kang Na Eon still the team leader?

240
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:37,940
No.

241
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:40,930
It's not that...

242
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,200
F***. Seriously.

243
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,680
My goodness.

244
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,650
What's wrong with her?

245
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:54,070
I don't know.

246
00:21:54,070 --> 00:21:56,680
We'll take a group Boomerang video.

247

 Cheers! 

248
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:03,200
- Thank you! 
 - Thank you!

249
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,220
- Thank you! 
 - Thank you!

250
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,740
- Gosh. 
 - Seriously.

251
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:12,450
My Rex.

252
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:17,420
Princess wasn't a princess, but a queen today.

253
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,450
- Queen. 
 - I completely lost it.

254
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:22,180
- She lost it. 
 - Queen...

255
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,950
This is all... Focus, focus, focus.

256

257
00:22:27,770 --> 00:22:30,960
- Thank you so much. 
 - Don't mention it.

258
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,400
Thank you even more, Oppa.

259
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,560
Thank you!

260
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,810

261

Honey, treat Eun Ho to a meal if you get a commercial deal.

262
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,160
I'll think about it.

263
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,960
My gosh.

264
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,840
Where did he go?

265
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,210
He went back to the office.

266
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,730
"I won't go to the team dinner."

267
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:56,140
"I hate stuff like that."

268
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,910
Totally unbelievable.

269
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:01,340
- Unbelievable indeed. 
 - Whoa!

270
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,250
 I can do it too, if I set my mind to it. 

271
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:23,000
 Let's cheer up together. 

272
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,030
 Call me Noona. 

273
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:27,090
   

274
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:35,570
   

275
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:42,270
 I did an amazing job. Have a look. 
   

276
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,340
 I hate you a little for nagging me to rush this, but 

277
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:46,740
 I'll forgive you since you're handsome. 

278
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,740

 Jenny did it. 

281
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:08,620
 Five concepts was a bit much. 

282
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:12,720

286
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,840
 Yes, yes. I'll email you the estimate right now. 

287
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,010
 Yes, thank you. 

288
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:53,640
 Brand images. Check if we received a fax on brand images, Jenny. 

289
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,540
 Okay. 

290
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,440
 Oppa, could you send me the sound file? 

291
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,040
 Okay, I will. 

292
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:04,070
 - Which yellow design do you prefer between No. 1 and No. 4? 
 - Hello, you got it, right? 

293
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:14,820
 Was I the one who was stuck in one place? 

294
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,850
   

295
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:28,660
 Hey, did you leave already? 

296
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,880
How could you leave without even clanking glasses?

297
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,910
We all worked hard together.

298
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:36,840
 Did you do public service in the military? You have no comradery. 

299
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,500
Thank you.

300
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:45,520
- You don't have to thank me— 
  - At times like this, you just need to say "Thank you" back. 

301
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,740
Thank you.

302
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:56,390

303
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:55,330
 The shoemaker called 119. 

304
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:58,530
 Who's the culprit, then? 

305
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,250
Yes.

306
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,810
 Are you okay, patient? 

307
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,890
Are you okay, Ms. Kang? Can you hear me?

308
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,470
- Check the vital signs. 
 - Okay.

309
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,000
- Blood pressure? 
 - 70 over 140.

310
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,530
- Okay, load SM. Let's move her to the ICU. 
 - Okay.

311
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,210
- Can you hear me, Ms. Kang? 
 - Ms. Kang Na Eon!

312

313
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,080
