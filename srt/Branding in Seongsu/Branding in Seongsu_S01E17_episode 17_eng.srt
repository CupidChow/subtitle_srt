1
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,360
   

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,460
 Where am I... 

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,100
 You're at HQ Motors. 

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,000
 A-Are you okay? 

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,600
 Motors? 

6
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,530
 The HQ Motors project... 

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,520
 Make it fall through. That's my condition. 

8
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,270
 I'll give up... 

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,300
 on this project. 

10
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:37,100
 - Pardon? 
 - Pardon? 

11
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:44,930


12
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,740
   

13
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:00,970
   

14
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,750
   

15
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,580
   

16
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,970
   

17
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:07,320
   

18
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:25,470
   

19
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,280
Sunbae!

20
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,300
Sunbae?

21
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,040
What's going on?

22
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,780
You scared me!

23
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,120
What are you doing?

24
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,070
What happened with HQ Motors?

25
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,530
Why didn't you answer my calls?

26
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,600
Come on. I was in too much shock that we suddenly switched.

27
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,610
What?

28
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:57,480
W-What are you doing? You're scaring me.

29
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,860
What are you doing?

30
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:03,200
What's with the texts you exchanged with Director Han?

31
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,820
 I'll tell you what you want to know under one condition. 

32
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:12,830
Geez, I was just doing what he wanted to join his side.

33
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,560
What did he want you to do?

34
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,250
I need to know so I can do it.

35
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:18,470
I'm not so sure yet.

36
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:23,750
Gosh, he's such a snake. He kept dragging on and didn't get to the point.

37
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,540
Well, then...

38
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,930
Geez, what are you doing? You're out of your mind.

39
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:38,370
Just pretend you're kissing a mirror.

40
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:42,170
We switched again at an important moment. We need to switch back.

41
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:46,360
Sunbae, do you really think kissing is the way?

42
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,010
Come on. You're not an N. 
  (One of the MBTI personality types) 

43
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,520
You're an S.

44
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,190
- Bring your mouth here. 
 - Geez, I don't want to!

45
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:57,130
Why are you acting like such an ahjussi?

46
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,140
By chance...

47
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,400
you didn't sneak a kiss when I was sleeping last night, right?

48
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,840
Are you crazy?

49
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,650
Kissing doesn't make you switch, okay?

50
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:08,480
Don't come near me.

51
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,560
Why? Why are you doing this?

52
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,370
So Eun Ho.

53
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,530
Focus... on me.

54
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:26,690
What are you saying? What a cheesy line. Seriously.

55
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:28,960
Geez. Don't come near me, I said.

56
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,530
Geez!

57
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,030
I'm a man, too, okay?

58
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,770
See?

59
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,460
I told you that's not it!

60
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:49,880
We already knew a little peck like that wouldn't work.

61
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:53,970
Be serious and give me a real kiss.

62
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:57,370
Just pretend that you love me or something.

63
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:00,280
Do you think you can pretend that?

64
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,450
- Haven't you? 
 - What do you mean?

65
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,950
Haven't you ever...

66
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:09,000
loved me?

67
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:33,960
What are you two doing right now?

68
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,450
Gosh! Geez. What are you doing?

69
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,380
Sunbae! Seriously.

70
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,960
My gosh, my gosh.

71
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,060
I told you not to!

72
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,700
What?

73
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,030
Did we switch again?

74
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,120
Whoa.

75
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,660
Shit.

76
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:34,300
So Eun Ho, let's talk.

77
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,730
Talk here.

78
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:37,880
In front of me.

79
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:42,060
You don't know what that pervert might do to you.

80
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,090
I'm sorry... but she's the pervert, okay?

81
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,090
Fine. Let's talk here.

82
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,140
What will you do if our bodies switch suddenly again?

83
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:57,630
- Bodies switch? 
 - It's driving me crazy, too.

84
00:05:57,630 --> 00:06:00,370
Gosh, why did we have to suddenly change again?

85
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,560
What are you guys talking about?

86
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,360
So Eun Ho.

87
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,610
Keep the voice recording function on for now.

88
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,030
I'll do the same.

89
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:08,290
All day?

90
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,840
Don't you think we should prepare if it happens again?

91
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,450
That's a great idea.

92
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:14,120
Let's do that.

93
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,220
Guys... I'm here, too.

94
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,810
Right.

95
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:19,820
What did you do with my underwear?

96
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:21,460
Oh, that?

97
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,560
I washed it and hung it by the dryer.

98
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,870
Should I get it for you?

99
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,510
No, I'll get it.

100
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:29,130
Oh, okay.

101
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,460
Why did you handle Na Eon's underwear?

102
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,410
Na Eon, I'll get you new underwear.

103
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:41,430
Don't wear anything he touched,

104
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:44,340
just rip it up!

105
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,350
- Wait for me, Sunbae. 
 - Na Eon!

106
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:56,590
Na Eon!

107
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,860
I'll sit next to her.

108
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,270
The passenger seat is mine.

109
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,300
Right, Sunbae?

110
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,570
 He's been managing HQ Motors for years. 
   

111
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:53,190
 Team Leader, I've followed Director Han as you instructed. 

112
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:56,920
 Does your job... 

113
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,580
 include spying these days? 

114
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:04,190
 T-The thing is... T-Team Leader Nam... 

115
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:07,580
 told me to at the Mood party. 

116
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,000
 Is that so? 

117
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,110
 I'm also a team leader. 

118
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:16,090
 Could you do me a favor too? 

119
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:29,500
He took terrible pictures.

120
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,030
 Someone from HQ Motors blatantly wined and dined him? 

121
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:41,510
Pathetic bastard.

122
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:54,160
 I'm Jeong Seong Hyeon from the marketing staff at HQ Motors. 

123
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,090
 You mean what you said yesterday, right? 

124
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,920
What's this?

125
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,180
   

126
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,590
Yes, Sunbae.

127
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,690
 Where are you right now? Are you at the office? 

128
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:13,450
I'm at Daeseongjang.

129
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:15,340
The project you gave me.

130
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,680
 I'm staying overnight to do researchâ€” 

131
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,090
What did you do yesterday?

132
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,850
What do you mean?

133
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:23,140
 Yesterday... 

134
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,220
when our bodies switched at HQ Motors...

135
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,650
What?

136
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,260
Did we switch again?

137
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:14,510
Geez, why do we keep switching? I'm about to go crazy.

138
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,960
So Eun Ho.

139
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,070
What exactly did you tell HQ Motors yesterday?

140
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,490
 Well, they said they'll work with Segye Group. So I said that's fine. 

141
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,130
What?

142
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,640
Seriously, I'm so tired.

143
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,790
My gosh. Hey, baby.

144
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:33,760
 The Director wants to talk. I'll call you later. 

145
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,170
Sorry. I dragged him here because he was refusing to come.

146
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,370
You've got to be kidding me. Seriously.

147
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:44,760
I won't be able to join you today, something came up.

148
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,760
Well, then...

149
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,810
Come on. You want to take off by yourself?

150
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,700
Come on. We'll never let you.

151
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,900
You can't.

152
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:03,380
   

153
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,880
Should we offer the lowest rates?

154
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,270
It's already the lowest of the lowest of the lowest.

155
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,170
They reduced the rates ten years ago.

156
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,230
Do you think the price was ever the issue?

157
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,520
We wouldn't come here even if we were paid. Right?

158
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,710
Gosh, it's not like we can target the cheaters.

159
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:24,170
I desperately need caffeine.

160
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:26,960
Who wants coffee?

161
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,010
One.

162
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,710
- Two. 
 - Three.

163
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:32,260
Okay. I'll go.

164
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:34,070
- No, no. 
 - You're not allowed.

165
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:36,110
You'll go home pretending to go get coffee.

166
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:37,790
Yeah. You can't.

167
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:40,280
- Geez! 
 - My gosh!

168
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,350
What's with the weather now?

169
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:50,700
Maybe it's a sign that we should sleep here?

170
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,150
- My gosh. 
 - Oh, my.

171
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,680
- You want to die? 
 - Should we...

172
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,580
make coffee with that?

173
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:15,380
Try Yeong Ae's signature coffee.

174
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:21,240
It's better than Dolce Latte.

175
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,540
What are you doing, Unni?

176
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,180
Why aren't you starting a cafe?

177
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,270
This is so nice and retro.

178
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,540
Taster's Choice.

179
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:32,190
I'll leave for real this time if you keep doing this.

180
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,750
Why?

181
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,190
It's really tasty. Try some.

182
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,280
Don't be so cold, Eun Ho.

183
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,530
 My gosh, my gosh! 

184
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,530
What's this now?

185
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,200
Why is it getting spooky again?

186
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,340
 I've been okay while I'm in So Eun Ho's body. 

187
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,340
 What's going on? 

188
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,200
I think it's a power outage.

189
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:13,110
- Eun Ho oppa? 
 - Honey?

190
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,660
- My gosh! 
 - Eun Ho!

191
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:18,120
Oppa, are you okay?

192
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,340
- Are you okay? 
 - What's going on, Eun Ho?

193
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,390
Help him get up.

194
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:24,030
Be careful.

195
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,470
Shouldn't we go to the hospital?

196
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,860
I know.

197
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,310
Didn't you hear something strange just now?

198
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:35,310
Like what?

199
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:58,650
Let's hurry up!

200
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:01,240
I'll go ahead of you.

201
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,500
Is it that lady again?

202
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,640
I'm sorry about yesterday.

203
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:28,440
I was too rude when you just came to help.

204
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,620
I do admit that you were a bit rudeâ€”

205
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,420
- Come on. 
 - That girl.

206
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:34,640
It's okay. Things happen.

207
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:38,810
Han Byeol isn't a bad kid either.

208
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:42,930
She's been like that since her mom died.

209
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,100
I know.

210
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:56,980
I've also been without family for awhile.

211
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,060
You must've gone through a lot.

212
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:06,190
Your parents must be happy that you turned out so great.

213
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,650
Not really.

214
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:12,870
Nothing much has changed much since then.

215
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:15,230
They might be disappointed.

216
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:18,530
No, I'm sure they'd be proud.

217
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:23,660
You haven't changed because you've been protecting yourself.

218
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:31,220
I just want to protect the time I spent here.

219
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,320
That's all.

220
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:55,050
By the way, do we have to all be togetherâ€”

221
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:58,040
Apparently, you'll sleep better in a group.

222
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,380
Right, Eun Ho, baby.

223
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,830
I'll protect you, okay?

224
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:05,070
Rex is the most dangerous one here though.

225
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:06,900
We're a family. It's fine.

226
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,640
Right.

227
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,960
Geez...

228
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,800
Family.

229
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,940
I shouldn't be doing this right now.

230
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,920
 Well done. See you soon. 
   

231
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,190
   

232
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:53,080
- Han Byeol, Han Byeol. 
 - What?

233
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,290
Here. Take this with you.

234
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:03,990
You're leaving after staying for free.

235
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,800
Hey, you, the granddaughter.

236
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,780
Let me keep it brief before we check out.

237
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,070
We won't change anything.

238
00:17:15,070 --> 00:17:16,670
- What? 
 - What?

239
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,500
Is closing the only way, then?

240
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:24,350
No. To be honest,

241
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:28,450
you aren't interested in branding are you?

242
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,080
The clock that's been here for a long time.

243
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:43,620
 Han Byeol, let's measure your height here. 

244
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,660
 That's right. 

245
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,630
 Grandma, I grew, didn't I? 

246
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,190
 Yes, this much. 

247
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,850
 You grew this much. 

248
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:55,090
 Wow, I grew taller. 

249
00:17:55,090 --> 00:17:56,720
The doodles.

250
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,250
 Aigoo. What a beautiful drawing. Where's Grandma? 

251
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:03,670
 Is this me? 

252
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,640
 You're smiling too. 

253
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,360
 Grandma. 

254
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:11,530
The tricycle.

255
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,840
 It's fun, isn't it? 

256
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:17,420
 Grandma, aren't I good? 

257
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,970
 Of course, you are. 

258
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,540
 Slowly, slowly. 

259
00:18:23,350 --> 00:18:26,760
 And everything else that's occupying Daeseongjang. 

260
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:36,760
 Have fun at school. 

261
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,290
 - I'll be right back. 
 - All right. 

262
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:49,850
 Go inside, Grandma. You don't have to watch me. 

263
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,870
 I'll be back soon. 

264
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:01,990
They contain your memories with Han Byeol that you don't want to forget.

265
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,700
Daeseongjang. Even the name means the big star.

266
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:14,980
It has the same meaning as Han Byeol's name. 
  (Han Byeol means "one star" in Korean.) 

267
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:22,090
Refusing to change means you want to protect it.

268
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:24,670
I want to protect the time that's...

269
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,190
engraved at Daeseongjang.

270
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,840
 It's dark. It's dark. 

271
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,450
   

272
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,830
   

273
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,270
 

274
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:40,200
   

275
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:43,720
 A hotel in Seongsu-dong where time stopped.  
    

276
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,160
- Gosh. 
 - Wow.

277
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,460
It's amazing.

278
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,240
It's Newtro. Newtro.

279
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:52,060
Y2K is so hip these days.

280
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:56,810
Seriously. I love it. It's totally my style. My style.

281
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:58,540
Well...

282
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,720
I guess it's not bad.

283
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,280
Thank you.

284
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,860
Thank you so much.

285
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,380
But promise me just one thing.

286
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:13,400
You won't allow cheaters or minors to check in anymore.

287
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,150
They aren't cheaters.

288
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,070
I might not look like it, but I have a keen eye.

289
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,520
 Please give us a nice room with a good vibe. 

290
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:27,410
 I scolded them if they looked like cheaters. 

291
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,860
 Get out. We don't accept cheaters. 

292
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:32,560
 - Get out right now! 
 - What are you doing? 

293
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,760
You saw how scary I can be.

294
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,280
- Right, right. 
 - Scary grandma.

295
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,940
And the minors were...

296
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,360
 - Unni. 
 - You came, Noona. 

297
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,980
 - What's with the pizza? 
 - You said you wanted pizza. 

298
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,370
 The teen runaways in the neighborhood have nowhere to go. 

299
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,550
So, I suggested taking them in.

300
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,740
- Gosh. 
 - I'm tearing up.

301
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:56,230
For Daeseongjang...

302
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,880
we'll also look for a solution for the teen runaways.

303
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,650
R-Really?

304
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:07,880
We'll make an exception and help you.

305
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,790
Thank you.

306
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,200
All right, then. Underdogs, please take care of the rest.

307
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,110
- What? 
 - I'm off.

308
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,380
Gosh, are you leaving again?

309
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,540
You should work together until the end. Where are you going?

310
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:26,650
You can do a good job without me.

311
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,470
I believe in you.

312
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:36,700
â™«  Everything starts with you  â™«

313
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,240
He believes in us?

314
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,440
Why am I crying?

315
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,050
I think he said he believes in us.

316
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:51,350
â™«  The falling petals are pointing toward you  â™«

317
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:55,730
â™«  It's only for you  â™«

318
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,600
 Join Segye Group tomorrow. 

319
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:01,450
 What's this? 

320
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:05,290
   

321
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:08,070
So Eun Ho.

322
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,160
What exactly...

323
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,370
are you doing?

324
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,340
   

325
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,370
 The customer is not available at the moment. 

326
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,220
I'm sorry.

327
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,780
Take the flowers with you.

328
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,290
What's this...

329
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:49,740
 Welcome. 

330
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,790
 I'll have a white bouquet. 

331
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:54,440
 I suggest something colorful if it's a giftâ€” 

332
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:58,770
 No. A white bouquet will be good. 

333
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:05,230
 I'll give it to someone I couldn't protect. 

334
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,990
So Eun Ho, what exactly are you doing in my body?

335
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,560
 You saw what I was doing. 

336
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,690
I was buying flowers.

337
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:50,020
That's not what I'm talking about right now.

338
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,020
 What are you doing with Director Hanâ€” 

339
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:55,140
So Eun Ho. So Eun Ho!

340
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,950
Geez...

341
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,770
 Let me say it again. 

342
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:15,960
 I'll give up on the project with HQ Motors. 

343
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,890
 You said it had to be Seongsu Agency earlier. 

344
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:22,010
 I changed my mind. 

345
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:27,310
 You can't have everything... just because you want it. 

346
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:41,780
 Why are you suddenly giving up the HQ Motors project? 

347
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:45,560
 It's not just that project. 
   

348
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,980
   

349
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,990
 I want to take a break from work for awhile. 

350
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,870
 - Cha Jeong Woo. 
 - Na Eon. 

351
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:02,350
 Please take good care of Na Eon Sunbae. 

352
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:04,820
 What are you talking about? 

353
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,940
 Kang Na Eon... 

354
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,800
 must be struggling a lot. 

355
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,790
 I hope she is. 

356
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,240
What's going on?

357
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,420
So Eun Ho, seriously...

358
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:32,910


359
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:37,590
   

360
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:47,910
   

361
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:51,130
â™«  After the wave of thoughts came to a stop  â™«

362
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:56,590
â™«  The sadness overflows  â™«

363
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:08,060
â™«  I'm holding back, my heart that overflows again with hope  â™«

364
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:11,270
â™«  After hesitating  â™«

365
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:15,050
â™«  I'm hesitating, mmm ~  â™«

366
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:21,110
â™«  The words, just flow out like this  â™«

367
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:25,100
â™«  My days and nights are all about you  â™«

368
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:28,190
â™«  So much so that I forget myself  â™«

369
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:32,840
â™«  So will you stay with me?  â™«
