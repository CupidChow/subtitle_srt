1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,450
   

2
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:18,920


3
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:20,370
This bastard's body is coming in handy again.

4
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,400
You!

5
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:26,870
Who are you?

6
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,660
   

7
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,410
   

8
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:24,210
   

9
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:25,640
   

10
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,990
   

11
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:47,090
   

12
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,860
I think she went into momentary shock.

13
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:53,490
She's been in a coma for over a month now.

14
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,650
Is she okay?

15
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,540
We can't guarantee what will happen if she goes into shock again.

16
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:18,160
 Also, I didn't tell you since you've been acting like someone else, but 

17
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,410
 you know the CCTV inside the factory? 

18
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,200
 The memory card was definitely not there when I went there. 

19
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,460
 Please confirm this. 

20
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,480
 Was there a memory card in the CCTV? 

21
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,640
 Yes, there was. 

22
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,110
 But when I asked during the questioning, the police said it was there. 

23
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,270
 But it definitely wasn't there when I checked. 

24
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,330
 Hello. We'll have an interview with Seongsu Agency's 

25
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:54,670
Team Leader Do Yu Mi today.

26
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:59,430
I heard Seongsu Agency was behind the recent drag show that has been creating a buzz.

27
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:06,210
Yes, Seongsu Agency is becoming a bigger agency that respects minority groups and small brands.

28
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,080
We'll show you how much we've changed going forward.

29
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,800
Yes, I look forward to what would come next since this was so meaningful.

30
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,930
Thank you.

31
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,300
This might be a bit of a difficult question.

32
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:23,320
Since Team Leader Kang Na Eon's case was concluded as attempted suicide recently,

33
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,950
 a majority of the public opinion says Seongsu Agency and Segye Group were responsible. 

34
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:32,000
 I'm curious about Seongsu Agency's position on that. 

35
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,990
 We requested the CCTV footage from the police to get to the bottom of it. 

36
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:44,620
 But it turns out Team Leader Kang didn't attempt suicide. 

37
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,850
It wasn't suicide?

38
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:48,860
   

39
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,990
My gosh.

40
00:04:55,470 --> 00:05:00,810
It's not our fault that she fell because she was drunk.

41
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:05,920
- Was she drunk? 
 - Did she get wasted and fall on her own?

42
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,410
Was it you...

43
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,850
who did that Kang Na Eon?

44
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,590
What are you talking about?

45
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,020
It was just an accident.

46
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,980
Are you serious right now?

47
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,920
Team Leader, you need to come out for a second.

48
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,730
I'm busy right now.

49
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:47,160
Well, the thing is, right now—

50
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:48,340
I said I'm busy!

51
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,870
Team Leader Kang...

52
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,340
What?

53
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,400
You...

54
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:53,340
- What? What? What? 
 - My gosh, my gosh...

55
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,390
W-What are you doing?

56
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,450
It's me!

57
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,300
Why am I here?

58
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,980
W-Who are you?

59
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,760
Team Leader Kang isn't back to her senses yet.

60
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:27,050
Follow me.

61
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,570
Where is he taking her?

62
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:37,870
Who are you? He's not me! Call the police!

63
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:39,760
My gosh.

64
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,880
Who are you?

65
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:44,650
Turn your voice down, So Eun Ho.

66
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:53,560
No way. Is it you, Sunbae?

67
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,600
Gosh, no way.

68
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:03,570
H-How could our souls get swapped? This isn't some TV show.

69
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:06,020
You can't be the female lead, Sunbae.

70
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,710
The fact that you're the male lead is worse.

71
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:10,110
But I'm handsome.

72
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:13,450
Whatever. By the way...

73
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:16,560
Why are you so calm about it?

74
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,250
Because some time has passed.

75
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,600
Don't tell me...

76
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,370
you touched my body,

77
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:35,260
stroked it, and looked at it, right?

78
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,270
That's sexual assault!

79
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,250
I should be saying that, you bastard—

80
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,800
Don't swear with my pretty mouth, okay?

81
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,370
- You son of a bitch— 
 - I told you not to swear!

82
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,160
- Geez. 
 - Gosh!

83
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,300
You think only your body is precious, huh?

84
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,230
Okay. Bring it on, then.

85
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,860
Hey, what are they doing?

86
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,750
W-What are you doing right now, Sunbae?

87
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,980
- All right. 
 - W-What are you doing?

88
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,100
W-What are you doing, Sunbae? Why?

89
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:26,090
Gosh, what are you doing?

90
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,170
Put it back on.

91
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,650
We're in the office.

92
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,360
You'd better go home right now.

93
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,960
Oh, okay.

94
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,210
Whose home should I go to?

95
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:05,900
- Your home. 
 - Oh, okay.

96
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,440
S-So by "your home..."

97
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,820
- So Eun Ho, your home! 
 - Okay, okay, okay.

98
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,830
Team Leader Kang?

99
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,820
How...

100
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:30,640
I'm not Team Leader Kang. You're mistaken.

101
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,180
What? Wait, Oppa...

102
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:37,670
Team Leader Kang is...

103
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:43,400
Why are you giving us a free show?

104
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,450
Don't worry about it.

105
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,390
Okay.

106
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,890
I won't worry about it.

107
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,910
Excuse me!

108
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,600
   

109
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,560
What's this?

110
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,580
Kang Na Eon?

111
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,830
Na Eon.

112
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,460
Did you really wake up?

113
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,010
Geez!

114
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,180
- Wait— 
 - Stop. You've got the wrong person.

115
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,960
I-I mean, you got the right person...

116
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,300
So... Gosh...

117
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,320
What are you talking about? Are you okay?

118
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,860
How did you come all the way here?

119
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,030
Well, the...

120
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:40,280
The thing is, I need to go straight home right now.

121
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,340
Otherwise, Team Leader Kang will yell at me. Yes. Well...

122
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,000
I'm sorry.

123
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,020
Na Eon.

124
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,110
That was Kang Na Eon...

125
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,420
It was Na Eon, wasn't it?

126
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,210
So in summary,

127
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:08,730
Team Leader Kang, who fell while drunk, woke up, and came to work?

128
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,300
- Is she a zombie? 
 - And our Eun Ho...

129
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,750
welcomed Team Leader Kang by taking his shirt off.

130
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,480
Gosh, how was it?

131
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,700
No one asked him to do that.

132
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,970
Which team will she join then?

133
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:26,490
If she attempted suicide because of tough work, the company would be responsible.

134
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:29,100
So she could be reinstated as the team leader of Team 1.

135
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,410
But she got drunk and fell. They wouldn't send her to a good team.

136
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:36,750
But they wouldn't fire someone who just came back from the verge of death either.

137
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,470
That means...

138
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,000
She'll be sent to an inferior team without a team leader.

139
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,450
Perhaps our team, for example?

140
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,800
Where are you going, Oppa?

141
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,880
To bring in...

142
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,290
Team Leader Kang.

143
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,800
So, w-what's all this, Sunbae?

144
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,370
Memorize it. All of it.

145
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,560
What?

146
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,140
I don't know why our souls swapped,

147
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,970
but before we go back to normal, you and I

148
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,780
should be able to impersonate each other.

149
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,250
That's all the information on me.

150
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,340
Of course, 99% of it is my work.

151
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,700
Do you know a single thing about me then?

152
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:33,040
At 11 a.m. on May 24th, 1995.

153
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,480
Born in Seongam Hospital in Seongam, Gyeongsangnam-do.

154
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,300
Graduated from Seongam Kindergarten, Jegwang Elementary School,

155
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,230
Yurim Boys Middle School and High School. Your first love was—

156
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:42,080
Hey, hey, hey!

157
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,280
That's enough.

158
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,460
There's one thing I don't know.

159
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:54,220
The night I fell,

160
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,250
why were you at the handmade shoe factory?

161
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:04,680
I was on my way to meet you. And then I passed out.

162
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,010
Why were you coming to meet me?

163
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,620
Because I was worried.

164
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,650
I think you ended up that way because of me—

165
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,380
Why?

166
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:17,770
Did you report XU's malpractice or something?

167
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:25,140
   

168
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:33,100
You're really not cut out to be a culprit.

169
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,800
   

170
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,550
   

171
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,860
 What's with this bastard? Was he bluffing? 

172
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,930
What?

173
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,530
We were together that night.

174
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:04,380
What? Don't you remember?

175
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,230
That night, we...

176
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,610
kissed, you know.

177
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,350
Yes.

178
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,840
You had a girlfriend,

179
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,470
but you still kissed someone like that?

180
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:33,150
She's not my girlfriend. She's just a friend.

181
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,170
I was just joking around because I didn't want to lose then.

182
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,070
Anyway,

183
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:44,050
did you fall off the rooftop at the pop-up store because you were drunk?

184
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,930
No.

185
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,930
What's that?

186
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:17,970
Why is it a rabbit?

187
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,920
Geez!

188
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,640
What the heck?

189
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,870
Is it like a rabbit's curse or something?

190
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,580
Y-Yes, you were too cruel to the rabbit that day.

191
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,090
The rabbit must've heard you saying tens of billions and whatnot.

192
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,160
I know you deserved to die for the wrong you committed,

193
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,620
but it's his fault for trying to kill someone.

194
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,590
You bastard! It's your fault.

195
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:46,750
Come here! Come here!

196
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,550
I'll scold him. Stay put!

197
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:58,230
Anyway, is that why you're suspicious of all these people?

198
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,160
By the way,

199
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:03,820
why are you suspicious of me who's cute and lovable?

200
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,660
You're excluded for now.

201
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:16,490
- You're too soft. 
 - Yes.

202
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:22,300
That was a grudge that ran very deep.

203
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,620
What kind of life have you lived anyway?

204
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,200
Get ready.

205
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,880
For what?

206
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,940
I need to go back...

207
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,160
to where I belong.

208
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:56,760
Gosh, can't you carry this for me?

209
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,700
This isn't my body. It's yours.

210
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,520
Wow, there are green slippers.

211
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,020
I'll wear these. You wear these, Sunbae.

212
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:15,420
You did well for yourself.

213
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,860
Wow, this is huge.

214
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:28,920
Wow, Sunbae!

215
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,000
Daebak. We're so high up.

216
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,810
Sunbae.

217
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:49,960
Having souls swapped doesn't seem so bad.

218
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:55,140
You can't even afford utility bills.

219
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,860
What's all that?

220
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,970
Why do you have so many phones?

221
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,380
Use this.

222
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:11,000
Pardon?

223
00:19:11,770 --> 00:19:14,580
- What about my phone? 
 - I'll be using it.

224
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,250
What about your phone then?

225
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,210
I'll use that too.

226
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:23,680
She does whatever she wants.

227
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,550
Sunbae.

228
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:32,910
Why do you think our souls swapped?

229
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:40,140
This always happens for a reason in dramas or movies.

230
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,290
For example,

231
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,140
someone liked the other person for

232
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:49,330
a long time or something like that.

233
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,340
I didn't, though.

234
00:19:56,490 --> 00:19:58,660
Did you?

235
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,190
I didn't either, okay?

236
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,100
Why not?

237
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,380
You said you wanted everything including my soul.

238
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,840
Gosh, I was just...

239
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:17,780
saying nonsense because you said you'd fire me and whatnot.

240
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,840
Sunbae, a sexual assault using force—

241
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,640
They're...

242
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,430
so fascinating.

243
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,690
The movies or dramas, I mean.

244
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,640
How much do they love themselves...

245
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,670
that they can kiss themselves?

246
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:48,220
Just don't do it. What are you doing?

247
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,400
Don't you want to go back?

248
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,940
Huh? Oh!

249
00:20:58,010 --> 00:20:59,610
Let's do it.

250
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:01,660
Let's go ahead and kiss.

251
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:01,780


252
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:08,410
I think I've been holding on for too long.

253
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,600
   

254
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:20,060
♫  Don't call me "Of Yours"  ♫

255
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:23,270
♫  I just may achieve my dream, get up  ♫

256
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:27,470
♫  I'm driven by pain, even in the face of challenge and despair  ♫

257
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:30,110
♫  There's no need to stress  ♫

258
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,720
♫  That's my blue  ♫

259
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:41,660
♫  Just call me "Lady", don't call me "Of Yours"  ♫

260
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:49,680
♫  Just call me "Lady", don't call me "Of Yours"  ♫

261
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,780
♫  Pointy flat shoes  ♫

262
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,680
♫  Worn-out sneakers  ♫

263
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:01,890
♫  Whatever it is, I feel like I can touch the sky  ♫
