1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,460
   

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,000
   

3
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,840
I think you'd better go.

4
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,600
No, it's okay.

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,170
I know you're worried about Team Leader Kang.

6
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:52,820


7
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,320
Sir, should I take you to the hospital?

8
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,480
No, it's okay.

9
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,040
 XU Beauty's new product line that created a buzz with cruelty-free marketing 

10
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,200
 turned out to be fraudulent. At the headquarters... 

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,410
The handmade shoe factory.

12
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,790
   

13
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:07,970
   

14
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,820
   

15
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,610
   

16
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,110
   

17
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,420
   

18
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:32,580
   

19
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:47,250
Did we switch back?

20
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,090
I don't think this is the way.

21
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,350
Follow me...

22
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,020
to the room.

23
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,130
What? Sunbae, w-why the room?

24
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:17,170
Why am I going to your room?

25
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:19,760
Strategy meeting.

26
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:23,510
Or you can live in my body forever if you don't want to.

27
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,210
What?

28
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:28,950
No! Give me back my handsome face!

29
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,610
You've got to be crazy!

30
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,880
Drive properly, you bastard!

31
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:50,550
B-Bastard. What's wrong with him? So scary.

32
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,250
Drive faster.

33
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,100
I can't.

34
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,040
This car costs four times my salary. Four times more.

35
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,870
Four times my salary, you mean.

36
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,230
Don't get confused.

37
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:03,120
You're Kang Na Eon.

38
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,400
Then you're paying for the repair, right?

39
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,580
Talk casually.

40
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,500
- Pardon? 
 - Don't talk formally to me.

41
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,700
Like friends?

42
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,580
Yeah, like friends.

43
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:17,780
Listen, buddy. Hey!

44
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,210
I never drive. I'm scared to death right now!

45
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:21,700
Why don't you drive if you're so good at it?

46
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,730
What am I, your assistant?

47
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,430
You hear me? You bastard.

48
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,370
I'm sorry.

49
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,620
   

50
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,860
♫  It's over, baby  ♫

51
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,810
What?

52
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:54,580
Get your act together.

53
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:08,390
- Rumors said she had a thing with So Eun Ho. I guess it was true. 
 - What?

54
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,260
They came to work together.

55
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,250
They might wear the same outfit tomorrow.

56
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,900
You guys do it, too.

57
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,430
Carpool.

58
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,910
- Pardon? 
 - Pardon?

59
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,420
Even though you are both married.

60
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,940
No, no. It's not true.

61
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,570
- Daebak. 
 - It's not true.

62
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:30,180
- It's not true. 
 - Is it true?

63
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,170
You can't say stuff like that with my face.

64
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,060
Not my style.

65
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:42,430
Then watch and learn my style.

66
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,980
Okay. You remember what I said last night, right?

67
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,000
I forgot because I was nervous.

68
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,330
- Do you have wrinkles on your brain? 
 - Come on.

69
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,510
Say only pretty words with a pretty mouth.

70
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:06,500
Repeat after me.

71
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,430
Take responsibility for everything...

72
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,670
Take responsibility for everything...

73
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,740
- and do it voluntarily. 
 - and do it voluntarily.

74
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:23,970
I'll join the Underdog Team.

75
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,740
You don't have to start by talking about work.

76
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,430
Are you feeling okay?

77
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,290
Yes.

78
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,770
I-I'm okay.

79
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:48,220
I'll work hard.

80
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,040
Did she hurt her head when she fell?

81
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,860
I think she's lost it a bit.

82
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,250
Na Eon,

83
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:03,990
the entire Seongsu Agency will be responsible. It's not just your—

84
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:08,550
She wants to be responsible on her own. There's no reason to stop her.

85
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,460
She can't be reinstated as the team leader of Team 1 after causing a disturbance.

86
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,290
Don't you agree?

87
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,260
Yes, I agree. I agree.

88
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,680
Not just anyone can take that position.

89
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,520
 We have two goals. 

90
00:07:38,530 --> 00:07:40,590
Goal 1.

91
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,320
 Find the bastard who tried to kill me. 
   

92
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:48,560
 And goal 2 is getting back my position. 

93
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,560
 Well... 

94
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,420
 Those aren't our goals. They're both your goals, aren't they? 

95
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:59,600
 You used your head for the first time. 

96
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,280
 If you help me, 

97
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,360
 I'll put the effort in to switch our bodies back. 

98
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:14,860
 That doesn't sound quite right. 

99
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:18,220
 Wouldn't you want to get your body back too? 

100
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,540
 No, I don't. 

101
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:24,370
 It might be easier to become an executive in a male body. 

102
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:29,720
 All right! Then this is my house! Yes! 

103
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,300
 Where should we start? 

104
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,270
 First of all, join the Underdog Team as the team leader. 

105
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,250
 That way, we can be together for 24/7 

106
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:54,200
 and freely look for the culprit. 

107
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,940
 By the way, if I work 24/7... 

108
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,690
 do I get paid overtime? 

109
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:18,860
I'll be in charge of the Underdog Team for now and work hard.

110
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:26,440
Looks like you finally understand the situation now that the video has come out.

111
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,180
But they do say that love for your colleagues is love for your country.

112
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:33,460
I'll give you a project even though you're on the Underdog Team since we go way back.

113
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,300
I'm different than you.

114
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,090
W-Whoa, thank you.

115
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,600
   

116
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,680
Sex toy?

117
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,170
Show us what you've got.

118
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,820
 Since she caused a disturbance, 

119
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:10,000
 - her salary will be reduced for six months and she'll become the team leader for the Underdog Team.  
 - Gosh!

120
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,030
I quit.

121
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:13,660
Thank you all for everything up until now.

122
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:16,380
Thank you and I love you and I'll miss you. I love—

123
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:19,120
Rex, you're not done paying for the purse.

124
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,440
Please go back to your seat.

125
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,390
Gosh. Damn you, Chanel.

126
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:25,600
What do we do now, Eun Ho?

127
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,700
You can't act like the team leader when Team Leader Kang comes.

128
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,840
What a pity.

129
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,360
I never pretended to be the team leader.

130
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,220
Gosh, give me a break.

131
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,830
"Do this. Do that."

132
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:39,590
You were so sexy when you said that.

133
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,730
Let's stop joking around and pay attention.

134
00:10:42,730 --> 00:10:47,140
You know how intense Team Leader Kang can be.

135
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:53,010
Sunbae! Sunbae!

136
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,900
Sunbae...

137
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,740
What?

138
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:04,830
Gosh, it hurts.

139
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:11,200
That son of a bitch.

140
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:15,960
   

141
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,640
Wow. They say the job makes the person.

142
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,070
Being a team leader is a nice position.

143
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,700
Gosh, it's so soft. 
    

144
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:29,240
Hold still, please.

145
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,610
The photo turned out so nicely.

146
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,880
It turned out nicely.

147
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:37,500
 What's with Team Leader Kang? 

148
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,970
 Why is she so dopey? 

149
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,880
 And what happened to her awful personality? 

150
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,030
 That's what I'm saying. 

151
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:45,820
 I guess the bitch got a new personality. 

152
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,170
 Do you prefer the left or the right? 

153
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:51,470
 Right. 

154
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:53,330
 Definitely the right. 

155
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:55,530
 What do you think, Eun Ho honey? 

156
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:57,530
 If she suggests a team lunch... 

157
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,470
 can I run away? 

158
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:03,010
Whoa, why did it come out so nicely?

159
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,490
Check your messenger!

160
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,620
Being a team leader is cool.

161
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:20,400
 Awful personality? 

162
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,560
 The bitch? 

163
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,740
Take a break. Relax...

164
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,330
   

165
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:31,570
   

166
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:33,670
   

167
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:37,410
My gosh! Hey! Why did you invite Team Leader Kang?

168
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:40,890
Pardon?

169
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,820
You invited me to the team group chat. Thank you!

170
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,230
You're welcome.

171
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,510
Let's have lunch together later.

172
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:54,830
I'd love that.

173
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,040
Do you want to go to a place I know?

174
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,900
There's a 5,000-won  (~$3.75)  all-you-can-eat Korean place nearby.

175
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:01,040
They're really amazing.

176
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,850
- I'm definitely coming! 
 - Sounds good! Sounds good!

177
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:06,160
- Yay. 
 - You're the best.

178
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,280
My goodness.

179
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,950
I'm so happy.

180
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,440
You ruined your image.

181
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,270
That's why you shouldn't have said "son of a bitch" using my mouth.

182
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,390
Get to work.

183
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,330
   

184
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,540
   

185
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,140
I can't believe this is what you prepared.

186
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:49,210
Well, which part do you not like?

187
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:52,420
Everything! All of it!

188
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,270
Start over from the beginning.

189
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:56,780
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

190
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:18,650
 Didn't you say you would take care of Kang Na Eon? 

191
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,610
   

192
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,180
 Our current prime suspect is... 

193
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,340
Do Yu Mi.

194
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,610
What?

195
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,220
Team Leader Do?

196
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:05,200
Come on, seriously. You're saying she tried to kill someone because she was blinded by jealousy?

197
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,230
Just to get a team leader position?

198
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:12,250
It's not just a team leader position. It's the most powerful position at Seongsu Agency.

199
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,430
Okay, okay.

200
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:19,190
There are those type of people...

201
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:24,330
who would do anything to get what they want.

202
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:28,840
Wow, were you describing yourself just now?

203
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,750
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,800
You said you used to be friends.

205
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,810
It's normal for friends to fight while growing up.

206
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:43,520
I don't have friends.

207
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,690
I can tell.

208
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:49,510
Gosh, this is no good.

209
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,670
I should become your friend.

210
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,060
Give me your hand.

211
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,300
Here.

212
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,540
Keep it, keep it. Keep it.

213
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:09,560
I'm sorry, but please don't fall for me.

214
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,190
Hey, hey, hey!

215
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:18,410
You haven't even eaten today.

216
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,410
Coffee. Alcohol. Coffee. Alcohol.

217
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,370
Are you trying to destroy my body?

218
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,960
I can focus better this way—

219
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,680
Geez. This is no good.

220
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,640
- Let's go. 
 - Go where?

221
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,760
Let's go. Bring your card with you.

222
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:33,020
- I don't want to. 
 - Let's get going.

223
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:35,220
- Come with me right now. 
 - Where are we going?

224
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:37,630
We're just going somewhere.

225
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,060
   

226
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,820
- It's raining. 
 - Geez, it's raining.

227
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,140
It's nearby. Let's go.

228
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:07,400
I'll make you a scallion pancake since it's raining.

229
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,390
- Flour and... 
 - Pay with this.

230
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,050
So Eun Ho?

231
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:13,810
Gosh, daebak. What's this?

232
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,080
Is this a Black Card?

233
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,030
I've never seen one in person.

234
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:20,300
Handle it carefully.

235
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,400
That's not enough. That's not enough.

236
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:35,470
Wait for me, Sunbae.

237
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,290
Gosh, Sunbae.

238
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,480
Listen to me.

239
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:42,180
Whether we catch the culprit or our bodies switch back,

240
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,060
we need to eat before all that.

241
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,590
We can just order in.

242
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:56,430
Do you know how much disposable containers hurt the earth?

243
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:02,250
Why does my stomach keep hurting?

244
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,500
What's the date today?

245
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,650
Today is the 18th.

246
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,510
That's it.

247
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:29,210
   

248
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:40,490
Come on, it can't be.

249
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:49,010
It's not true, right? Sunbae, come on.

250
00:18:49,010 --> 00:18:52,330
I'm a man. It can't be, right?

251
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,270
The dressing isn't too bad.

252
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:16,950
I also made the dressing myself.

253
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,760
Don't be gross and eat someone else's food.

254
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,260
What? Why is that yours?

255
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,880
And it's not like we're strangers.

256
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:27,100
You're me, and I'm you. You know?

257
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,150
Gosh, my stomach.

258
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,180
How long does this last?

259
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,550
A week at the most.

260
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,690
Just hang in there.

261
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,390
You've been through a lot, Sunbae.

262
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:49,420
For living like this all this time.

263
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,320
Eun Ho.

264
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,490
What is it?

265
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,370
So, what will you do about the branding?

266
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:11,670
Gosh, seriously, you're such a workaholic.

267
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:20,380
You acted all superior, talking about branding and sincerity when we worked on XU.

268
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,930
But you don't seem confident now.

269
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,520
What are you good at, exactly?

270
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,900
I'm really good at naming plants.

271
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:31,020
- This one is— 
 - That's completely useless.

272
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,370
We need to do a great job with this one.

273
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,190
If we shake up Do Yu Mi when she doesn't expect it,

274
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,750
she'll crumble easily.

275
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:45,980
So you're certain Yu Mi Sunbae is the culprit, right?

276
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,930
No, it would've been impossible by herself.

277
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:52,100
There's definitely someone else.

278
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:59,490
When Do Yu Mi crumbles,

279
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,100
they'll show themselves.

280
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,770
Shit!

281
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,740
What's wrong with you?

282
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:14,330
Okay, I'll give it my best.

283
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:20,880
But I don't know much about that market though.

284
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:29,600
What kind of marketer only does what they're good at? Huh?

285
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:34,960
Geez...

286
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,540
Meet with the CEO first.

287
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:42,280
The brand identity ultimately comes from the creator of the brand.

288
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:46,540
Where are you going?

289
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,440
What do you care?

290
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,780
The brand identity...

291
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:06,540
ultimately comes from the creator of the brand.

292
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,860
That's exactly what you said, Da Eun.

293
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:26,970
For sexy and passionate women,

294
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:36,030
I take pride in making toys that give them satisfying orgasms.

295
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:42,730
So, I hope that brand image comes through.

296
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:47,440
A very racy,

297
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,520
very secretive,

298
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,170
and private...

299
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,750
world of our own.

300
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:05,620
Yes, racy and secretive.

301
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,190
Gosh, I'm so curious.

302
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:12,250
Gosh, I hate bright lights.

303
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,120
Is the store currently in the basement? 
    

304
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:21,500
Women tend to be a bit embarrassed about buying sex toys.

305
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,720
- Don't you agree? 
 - Pardon? No.

306
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,480
I'm not sure. I don't really use stuff like that.

307
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,480
My husband has a lot of stamina.

308
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,470
I'm the mother of five children.

309
00:23:34,470 --> 00:23:36,020
- I have five boys. 
 - My gosh!

310
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,390
Unni. TMI. TMI.

311
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,210
- Is it? 
 - Seriously.

312
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:46,990
By chance, if it helps to go to the store,

313
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:49,620
would you like to come with me?

314
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:53,440
Our hidden,

315
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:56,390
suppressed,

316
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:01,600
and secretive desires that we have...

317
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,710
to the uncharted territory.

318
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,950
- Wow. 
 - Uncharted territory?

319
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,880
Sounds good.

320
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:22,950
Team Leader?

321
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:34,220
Let's go to the uncharted territory.

322
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,950
This is even KC-certified.

323
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:52,610
It's a product that guarantees safety.

324
00:24:53,390 --> 00:25:00,160
Since it's a product that you insert,

325
00:25:00,950 --> 00:25:04,630
it blocks electromagnetic waves,

326
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,810
and it safely takes you...

327
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,910
to paradise!

328
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,130
Amazing.

329
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:23,250
So I call this one Kkaebi Kkaebi.

330
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:25,070
As in Dokkaebi  (Goblin) .

331
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,070
- Wow. Kkaebi Kkaebi? Kkaebi Kkaebi. 
 - Kkaebi Kkaebi.

332
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:31,030
Kkaebi Kkaebi, I missed you.

333
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:33,520
Kkaebi Kkaebi, Dokkaebi.

334
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,950
I like the name.

335
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,930
Rex, take notes so we can create visuals later.

336
00:25:37,930 --> 00:25:40,850
- I'm checking them out. 
 - Look at this.

337
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:45,490
Yeong Ae, please make a list of product characteristics and prices.

338
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:46,630
And Jenny...

339
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:49,540
- Tricky fox and cat. 
 - My gosh, my gosh.

340
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:51,180
Me, too.

341
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,840
You should work hard, too.

342
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,900
- Isn't it cool? 
 - Eun Ho!

343
00:25:55,900 --> 00:26:00,140
Are you still pretending to be the team leader when Team Leader Kang is here?

344
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,790
You're right.

345
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:09,170
Mr. So. Please be careful.

346
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:11,800
Aren't you going to answer?

347
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:16,920
It's because he's immature.

348
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,140
He feels embarrassed and flustered right now. Right...

349
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:24,900
Okay. I need to go teach him a lesson.

350
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,320
Gosh, go easy. Go easy. Don't be like that.

351
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,420
Oh, my God!

352
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,190
Mr. So.

353
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,880
I did okay, didn't I, Sunbae?

354
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,400
Can't you compliment me?

355
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,200
I even have cramps in your place.

356
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:49,140
Did you take the medicine?

357
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,130
I took two earlier.

358
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,760
Good job.

359
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,730
In any case,

360
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:01,330
you created clear roles for the team members.

361
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:04,630
I thought you didn't care about them at all.

362
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:08,460
I don't care. I'm just giving them tasks that suit them.

363
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,200
Yes, yes, of course.

364
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,180
What's that now?

365
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,270
Where did he go?

366
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:45,220
Wow, what's all this?

367
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:58,450
What?

368
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:04,860
Gosh, I got spooked.

369
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:24,430
Gosh, you scared me!

370
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,880
What's going on?

371
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,480
Did you run over because you were worried about me?

372
00:28:41,230 --> 00:28:43,300
Wow! They have stuff like this, too.

373
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,480
How fascinating.

374
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:56,370
Hey, take it off.

375
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,040
- It's done. 
 - What are you doing...

376
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,850
Hey, take it off.

377
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,830
Take it off.

378
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:04,300
I'll take it off if you behave.

379
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,760
- Take it off. 
 - I don't want to.

380
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,800
- Take it off, I said. 
 - I don't want to.

381
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,620
I don't want to. Here, take it.

382
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:27,760


383
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:38,120
   

384
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:41,850
♫  My mouth was full, baby  ♫

385
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:45,790
♫  A feeling that lingered for too long  ♫

386
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:48,040
♫  Intense bitter, yet sweeter  ♫

387
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,880
♫  That's right, in the thrill of the moment  ♫

388
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,040
♫  Everything's changed, I don't know what to do   ♫

389
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:02,960
♫  I just crinkle my nose, and I feel you for awhile  ♫

390
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,080
♫  If you know you, Bae  ♫

391
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:10,830
♫  How could I not love you?  ♫

392
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:14,560
♫  Like in a dream  ♫

393
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,010
♫  I'm afraid to forget everything  ♫

394
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:23,810
♫  Even if I cover my eyes, even if I try to shake it off  ♫
