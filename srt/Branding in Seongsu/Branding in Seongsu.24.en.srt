I'm sorry.

To be honest,

37
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,357
I had a goal I wanted to achieve.

00:03:10,507 --> 00:03:11,977
It was my fault.

five years or now,

76
00:05:48,507 --> 00:05:50,736
that the only way to cover up your controversy...

77
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:54,007
is with a bigger controversy?

78
00:05:56,207 --> 00:05:57,247
Well...

79
00:05:57,807 --> 00:05:59,416
Why would you ask me that?

80
00:05:59,577 --> 00:06:00,817
I don't understand.

81
00:06:01,517 --> 00:06:03,617
I guess it could work right now.

82
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:05,286
But...

83
00:06:06,017 --> 00:06:08,327
the misunderstanding that people have about you...

84
00:06:09,387 --> 00:06:10,557
won't be solved.

88
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:23,066

170
00:10:37,257 --> 00:10:38,597
Says who?

171
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,526
Everything will get revealed from the investigation.

172
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:44,166
Let me tell you this first.

173
00:10:47,436 --> 00:10:48,867
I killed...

174
00:10:50,806 --> 00:10:52,176
your girlfriend.

175
00:10:54,306 --> 00:10:55,406
It was because of you.

176
00:10:59,377 --> 00:11:00,847
Keep this in mind forever.

177
00:11:09,587 --> 00:11:10,757
Stop.

178
00:11:13,456 --> 00:11:14,897
You keep it in mind too.

179
00:11:15,627 --> 00:11:17,267
It's all your fault.

180
00:11:18,326 --> 00:11:19,566
Don't listen to her, So Eun Ho.

181
00:11:26,607 --> 00:11:27,706
So Eun Ho.

182
00:12:06,017 --> 00:12:07,776
So you confessed everything with your own lips.

183
00:12:09,247 --> 00:12:10,686
Things will move swiftly thanks to you.

184
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,987
I'm not the same type of person as you.

185
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:24,926
Gosh.

You will get arrested for inciting murder.

189
00:12:36,747 --> 00:12:37,747
Arrest her.

190
00:12:39,247 --> 00:12:41,216
Let go of me. Let go!

191
00:12:41,217 --> 00:12:43,486
Let go of me!

192
00:12:43,487 --> 00:12:46,257
I think you must come with us too, Mr. Cha Jung Woo.

Okay.

Let's get going.

195

You did well to hold it in.

196
00:13:48,847 --> 00:13:50,387
I knew it was weird.

197
00:13:50,987 --> 00:13:53,086
As soon as the article came up,

198
00:13:53,087 --> 00:13:55,185
CEO Min gave me a solution.

199
00:13:55,186 --> 00:13:57,587
That just felt so suspicious.

200
00:13:58,826 --> 00:13:59,897
I'm serious.

201
00:14:00,997 --> 00:14:02,066

207
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,816
It will be hard for me for a while.

208
00:14:22,946 --> 00:14:25,356
There's the case that CEO Min brought up.

209
00:14:25,357 --> 00:14:27,257
My image is way down there right now.

210
00:14:28,926 --> 00:14:31,127
I think it'll be a bad influence to the project.

211
00:14:32,026 --> 00:14:33,056
A controversy...

212
00:14:34,196 --> 00:14:36,566

- What? - Don't you know open management?

230
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:33,617
It's the trend for the CEO to work with the employees.

231
00:15:37,257 --> 00:15:39,226
But won't it be better for you...

232
00:15:39,227 --> 00:15:40,997
for us to be separated?

233
00:15:41,227 --> 00:15:43,196

240
00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:57,806
All right. Manager Nam, you have to get out.

241

I don't want to become like Min Hee Jung,

256
