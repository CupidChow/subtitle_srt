00:01:46,117 --> 00:01:47,117

What? What are you doing?

52
00:03:17,408 --> 00:03:20,507
What do you think? It's an obvious kidnapping plan.

53
00:03:33,827 --> 00:03:36,898
Gosh, you're really close to our tent.

54
00:03:41,838 --> 00:03:43,637
Did So Eun Ho not come?

55
00:03:46,667 --> 00:03:47,838
Why would you ask me that?

56
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:50,878
I guess you're right.

57
00:03:51,577 --> 00:03:52,908
That does seem weird.

58
00:03:54,378 --> 00:03:56,248
Let go of me.

59
00:03:57,917 --> 00:03:58,917

61
00:04:02,957 --> 00:04:03,987
I do.

65
00:04:40,328 --> 00:04:41,796
- Yes! - Yes!

If there was someone you wanted to go against,

75
00:05:07,817 --> 00:05:10,387
you can call them out to the ring...

76
00:05:10,388 --> 00:05:12,327
and fight them with words.

77
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:14,186
"I want to fight this guy."

78
00:05:14,187 --> 00:05:15,528

80

that you've kept hidden from them,

81
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:24,237
why don't you come up to the ring with them?

82
00:05:24,797 --> 00:05:27,667
All right. Here's the first contestant.

83
00:05:35,448 --> 00:05:37,448

89
00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:01,167

90
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:02,778

91
00:06:05,747 --> 00:06:07,677

- Come out! - Come out!

94
00:06:14,117 --> 00:06:18,258
- Come out! - Come out!

95
00:06:20,953 --> 00:06:22,023
So Eun Ho!

96
00:06:28,593 --> 00:06:31,632
If this happens, Manager Cha Jung Woo...

97
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:34,233
naturally takes the win.

98
00:06:34,234 --> 00:06:35,564

102
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:07,593
Things have really changed.

103
00:07:08,604 --> 00:07:10,903
You and the company.

104
00:07:13,104 --> 00:07:14,573
I'm liking what I see.

105
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:17,073
I always told you this.

106
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,373
To forget about what had happened five years ago.

107
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:21,943
How did you manage to do it?

108
00:07:26,314 --> 00:07:27,513
Five years ago,

109
00:07:28,484 --> 00:07:30,383
you took all the responsibility.

110
00:07:31,753 --> 00:07:33,494
How did you manage to survive?

111
00:07:35,994 --> 00:07:38,534
It was because you struggled.

112
00:07:43,534 --> 00:07:44,564
Hee Jung.

113
00:07:45,874 --> 00:07:48,573
I tried my best to survive because of the people...

114
00:07:49,674 --> 00:07:52,343
who made us go through all that five years ago.

115
00:07:54,984 --> 00:07:56,013
But...

116
00:07:57,114 --> 00:07:58,854
I suddenly came upon this thought.

117
00:08:00,554 --> 00:08:02,383
That the person from five years ago...

118
00:08:03,854 --> 00:08:06,253
might be the same person...

119
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:11,124
as the person who tried to kill me.

120
00:08:13,864 --> 00:08:14,903
Really?

121
00:08:17,003 --> 00:08:18,374
Who is that?

122
00:08:24,643 --> 00:08:25,773
When?

123
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:28,914
- I love it. - Isn't it really good?

124
00:08:41,123 --> 00:08:42,294
Two this time.

125
00:08:42,863 --> 00:08:46,033
- Hurry up. - It's so good.

126
00:08:46,034 --> 00:08:47,092
All right, everyone.

127
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,232
- Yes. - Yes.

128
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:50,833

129
00:08:51,304 --> 00:08:55,573

130

131
00:09:05,814 --> 00:09:07,013

132

133
00:09:08,323 --> 00:09:09,554

- Treasure Hunt? - Give me a round of applause!

135
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,593
Okay!

136
00:09:16,064 --> 00:09:17,962
With this Treasure Hunt,

137
00:09:17,963 --> 00:09:20,993
you will work with a designated partner.

138
00:09:21,703 --> 00:09:24,564
Show us the list of partners!

139
00:09:26,573 --> 00:09:28,073
Give me a round of applause!

140
00:09:30,943 --> 00:09:32,242
Eun Ho, you're my partner.

141
00:09:32,243 --> 00:09:34,112
Have a great time...

142
00:09:34,113 --> 00:09:37,483
with your designated partner.

143
00:09:38,014 --> 00:09:40,314

144
00:09:44,953 --> 00:09:47,953
- The prizes are amazing. - Over here!

145
00:09:48,294 --> 00:09:49,523
Hurry up!

146
00:09:49,524 --> 00:09:50,963
Let's find ten.

147
00:09:51,564 --> 00:09:52,733
Let's go.

148
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:56,764
Forget it. We're not even kids.

149
00:09:58,304 --> 00:09:59,674
This is a permitted date.

150
00:10:00,233 --> 00:10:01,233
Let's go.

151
00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:08,784
I'm not expecting something amazing.

152
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:12,754
Just as usual,

153
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,223
I want to tell you...

154
00:10:16,353 --> 00:10:17,623
that I want to like you.

155
00:10:21,093 --> 00:10:22,093
What's wrong?

156
00:10:22,993 --> 00:10:24,723
I'm just going to like you on my own.

157
00:10:25,363 --> 00:10:26,534
Is that not even allowed?

158
00:10:26,664 --> 00:10:27,693
No.

159
00:10:28,233 --> 00:10:29,264
It's not allowed.

160
00:10:30,534 --> 00:10:32,103
A person's heart...

161
00:10:33,073 --> 00:10:35,174
sometimes becomes too big...

162
00:10:36,743 --> 00:10:37,904
for one to handle.

163
00:10:40,544 --> 00:10:41,644
So don't.

164
00:10:42,943 --> 00:10:44,684
Then how is it between you and So Eun Ho?

165
00:10:49,054 --> 00:10:50,554
I guess it's also hard to handle...

166
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:54,353
for the both of us.

167
00:11:30,794 --> 00:11:32,934
Gosh! I got so surprised.

168
00:11:33,394 --> 00:11:34,394
Gosh.

169
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:38,373
But why are you here?

170
00:11:39,504 --> 00:11:41,072
I was in the Treasure Hunt.

171
00:11:41,073 --> 00:11:42,443
Right. The Treasure Hunt.

172
00:11:44,073 --> 00:11:46,544
But you're too harsh.

173
00:11:46,814 --> 00:11:48,942
You were the one that suggested the Treasure Hunt.

174
00:11:48,943 --> 00:11:51,144
How could you just walk past us like that?

00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:49,872
The game where we find prizes?

190
00:12:49,873 --> 00:12:50,943
Treasure Hunt?

191
00:12:57,243 --> 00:12:58,384
Well,

192
00:12:59,284 --> 00:13:01,683
I thought our senior Young Ae...

193
00:13:01,684 --> 00:13:02,853
would do a good job alone.

194
00:13:05,593 --> 00:13:06,924
I'll do my best!

195
00:13:07,823 --> 00:13:08,863
Let's go!

196
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,233
There's nothing here.

197
00:13:15,504 --> 00:13:16,634
Let's go somewhere else.

198
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:22,373
- I can't find anything. - There's nothing.

199
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:24,073
From far away.

200
00:13:26,414 --> 00:13:27,414
Gosh.

201
00:13:41,993 --> 00:13:43,024
Eun Ho.

202
00:13:43,493 --> 00:13:44,493
Come this way.

203
00:13:48,634 --> 00:13:49,804
I can't find anything.

204
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:19,434
(The day Na Eon returned, Na Eon's Girlish pop-up, Na Eon's nosebleed)

205
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:09,414
What?

206
00:15:12,154 --> 00:15:14,314
- What's going on? - It must be a blackout.

207
00:15:14,384 --> 00:15:15,524
Gosh.

208
00:15:21,193 --> 00:15:22,223
Na Eon.

209
00:15:58,493 --> 00:15:59,493
Na Eon.

210
00:16:01,934 --> 00:16:03,034
Are you okay?

211
00:16:10,544 --> 00:16:11,703
Just wait right here.

212
00:16:12,274 --> 00:16:13,514
I'll get help.

213
00:16:15,713 --> 00:16:16,784
Don't go.

214
00:16:24,623 --> 00:16:26,054
Don't go, So Eun Ho.

215
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,174
I can go on my own.

216
00:17:07,363 --> 00:17:08,593
What's wrong with you?

217
00:17:10,633 --> 00:17:11,734
"I'm suffering."

218
00:17:12,933 --> 00:17:14,073
"I'm sick.

219
00:17:16,044 --> 00:17:17,873
Is it that hard to say those lines?

220
00:17:20,944 --> 00:17:22,944
You're just so full of yourself.

221
00:17:24,613 --> 00:17:26,153
Just a single line can solve things.

222
00:17:28,284 --> 00:17:29,883
You've made your apology five years ago.

223
00:17:31,024 --> 00:17:32,454
So does that mean...

224
00:17:34,593 --> 00:17:35,923
you don't care if I'm around or not?

225
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,034
You're going to suffer every single time it gets dark.

226
00:17:41,294 --> 00:17:42,433
"It's tough."

227
00:17:44,034 --> 00:17:45,304
"Be by my side."

228
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:48,673
Is it that hard for you to say these things?

229
00:17:52,014 --> 00:17:53,073
You know,

230
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:56,643
I need to hear those things from you.

231
00:17:59,214 --> 00:18:00,254
That's how...

232
00:18:03,254 --> 00:18:05,393
That's how I can go to you.

233
00:18:12,393 --> 00:18:13,494
I'm sorry.

234
00:18:27,214 --> 00:18:28,573
I'm sorry, So Eun Ho.

235
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:33,754
Do you know, Na Eon?

236
00:18:37,224 --> 00:18:38,353
Do you know...

237
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:42,194
what kind of heart I have lived with?

238
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,433
Hello.

239
00:18:54,974 --> 00:18:57,004
I'm the new intern, So Eun Ho.

240
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:58,714
No one would've known.

241
00:19:00,044 --> 00:19:01,244
I was smiling,

242
00:19:02,244 --> 00:19:04,583
but my heart was in a fiery pit.

243
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:07,454
I got into Kang Na Eon's team.

244
00:19:09,224 --> 00:19:10,323
This is just the start.

245
00:19:10,954 --> 00:19:12,954
I will bring her down to the ground.

246
00:19:13,153 --> 00:19:15,093
Even if you can't make things right,

247
00:19:15,323 --> 00:19:17,024
there's no need to cover it up.

248
00:19:17,893 --> 00:19:19,064
Did that...

249
00:19:20,264 --> 00:19:21,264
happen?

250
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:23,234
Luckily,

251
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:26,073
you were much more of a villain than I expected.

252
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,403
My blade of vengeance...

253
00:19:30,444 --> 00:19:31,973
was pointing toward you.

254
00:19:31,974 --> 00:19:33,814
What is it that you want?

255
00:19:34,143 --> 00:19:35,173
You.

256
00:19:35,413 --> 00:19:37,913
Every part of you including your soul.

257
00:19:41,454 --> 00:19:43,353
So no matter what,

258
00:19:44,123 --> 00:19:45,893
I had to be next to you.

259
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:51,893
And when our souls changed,

260
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:54,494
I thought it was an opportunity.

261
00:19:55,903 --> 00:19:57,363
An opportunity...

262
00:19:58,933 --> 00:19:59,933
to bring down Kang Na Eon.

263
00:20:00,173 --> 00:20:01,204
What?

264
00:20:03,903 --> 00:20:05,173
But it was strange.

265
00:20:07,314 --> 00:20:10,984
The more and more I learned about you, you felt different.

266
00:20:16,024 --> 00:20:18,224
"Is she a better person than I thought?"

267
00:20:18,423 --> 00:20:20,024
Show them what you've got.

268
00:20:20,294 --> 00:20:23,464
I like your branding idea.

269
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:27,694
"Is she not that bad of person than she seems?"

270
00:20:29,464 --> 00:20:30,603
Do the presentation with this.

271
00:20:32,474 --> 00:20:34,534
But if you're not the villain,

272
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:37,103
who is to blame...

273
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:40,073
for all that has happened?

274
00:20:43,444 --> 00:20:45,784
If I didn't go to Segye Group that day...

275
00:20:48,984 --> 00:20:50,853
If I didn't meet you there...

276
00:20:54,623 --> 00:20:56,623
We wouldn't have suffered this much.

277
00:21:05,004 --> 00:21:06,004
We...

278
00:21:09,704 --> 00:21:11,744
wouldn't have felt this much pain.

279
00:21:18,643 --> 00:21:19,683
I...

280
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,583
couldn't forgive myself.

281
00:21:24,823 --> 00:21:25,823
So...

282
00:21:27,323 --> 00:21:29,724
that was why I did my best to survive.

283
00:21:30,863 --> 00:21:32,194
It's not your fault.

284
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,564
It's all my fault.

285
00:21:39,704 --> 00:21:41,004
So...

286
00:21:44,474 --> 00:21:45,814
let's stop feeling hurt.

287
00:21:50,014 --> 00:21:52,214
I don't want you to feel hurt.

288
00:21:53,183 --> 00:21:54,183
Me too.

289
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:57,323
I hate seeing you in pain.

What is this all of a sudden?

293
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,204
I wanted to greet you...

294
00:22:51,944 --> 00:22:53,113
for one last time.

295
00:22:54,643 --> 00:22:56,183
You're ready now...

296
00:22:57,314 --> 00:22:58,484
to let me go.

297
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:04,524
Did you feel happy during the five years...

298
00:23:04,754 --> 00:23:05,893
you prepared to get your revenge?

299
00:23:09,464 --> 00:23:11,524
I wish you can be free from me...

300
00:23:13,163 --> 00:23:14,794
and become happy now.

301
00:24:13,353 --> 00:24:14,954
See you later, So Eun Ho.

302
00:24:40,613 --> 00:24:41,613
Are you okay?

303
00:24:43,823 --> 00:24:44,823
Yes.

304
00:24:46,823 --> 00:24:48,123
You look tired.

305
00:24:49,764 --> 00:24:51,093
I'll drive.

306
00:24:52,734 --> 00:24:53,734
It's okay.

308
00:25:07,514 --> 00:25:09,643
I believe it must have been hard for you.

309
00:25:12,514 --> 00:25:13,583
Well...

310
00:25:17,323 --> 00:25:19,083
I didn't force myself to say it to stop you from going.

311
00:25:20,923 --> 00:25:21,994
I just...

312
00:25:23,494 --> 00:25:25,593
said what my heart felt.

313
00:25:26,863 --> 00:25:29,764
I know. That is why...

314
00:25:30,903 --> 00:25:34,204
I will follow my heart now too.

315
00:25:52,623 --> 00:25:53,853
Let me be beside you.

316
00:25:56,794 --> 00:25:58,764
Don't find the person who tried to kill you...

317
00:26:00,863 --> 00:26:02,194
on your own.

318
00:26:17,714 --> 00:26:18,784
Thanks.

319
00:26:27,853 --> 00:26:28,853
Actually,

320
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:32,423

is this?

324
00:27:03,464 --> 00:27:04,863
This seems like the original copy.

325
00:27:05,964 --> 00:27:08,734
The traces were removed.

326
00:27:10,234 --> 00:27:12,333
