1
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:07,560
   

2
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:21,940


3
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,320
What the...

4
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,820
Gosh, this looks so nice.

5
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,260
H-How is it?

6
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,830
What are you asking about?

7
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,560
This is a marketing ad package from Seongsu Agency.

8
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,640
Everything from casting for the commercial,

9
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,040
ta-da, including outdoor advertising.

10
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,050
Our main focus for this year is our beauty line targeting the MZ generation  (Korean Term for Millennials and Gen Zs) .

11
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:47,200
Isn't outdoor advertising a bit old-fashioned?

12
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,650
O-Oh... well...

13
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,680
Also, wasn't Team Leader Kang Na Eon...

14
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,470
supposed to come today?

15
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:03,270
Team Leader Kang probably...

16
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:04,450
won't be able to come today.

17
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:10,730
 I'm sorry. I completely forgot to tell you the meeting time changed. 

18
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,650
 Why is there so much traffic? 

19
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:16,910
Gosh, this is driving me nuts! There's only 15 minutes left!

20
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:22,560
Team Leader Nam, that son of a bitch!

21
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,910
How could he change the meeting time on his own without notifying us?

22
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:30,140
What about you not knowing the change of the meeting time?

23
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:34,920
I double-checked it... and he's the one who did something wrong, I—

24
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:38,580
It was obvious Team Leader Nam would try to pull something.

25
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:41,200
It's worse that you would be dumb enough to fall for it.

26
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,630
Come on, Na Eon.

27
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:45,170
- Mr. Driver. 
 - Yes?

28
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,870
Please get us there in five minutes. I'll pay you 200,000 won  (~$150)  more.

29
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,520
Hey, can't you see we're stuck?

30
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,130
Will the traffic clear if you pay me?

31
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:55,180
- 300,000 won  (~$225) ? 
 - Pardon?

32
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,850
400,000 won  (~$300) ?

33
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,520
If there is no path, you create one.

34
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:11,380
Car! Car! Car!

35
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:19,360
People! People! Goodness!

36
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,700
Get me out of here!

37
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,560
   

38
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,030
Give him 500,000 won  (~$375) . He got us here in four minutes.

39
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,430
Oh, okay.

40
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,270
Here. You can charge us 500,000 won  (~$375) .

41
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,020
   
     

42
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,910
He's the same as always.

43
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:48,290
His tricks are so obvious.

44
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,360
It's me.

45
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,160
Come to the new café in Seongsu-dong in three minutes.

46
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,600
 Hey, I'm on stand-by. 

47
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,110
 - Please be on standby.  
 - Then just be on standby for the rest of your life.

48
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,350
 It's a bed scene! 

49
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:04,040
Gosh, that was so hard. Right?

50
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,770
Shall we go?

51
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,200
Okay.

52
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,590
That's right.

53
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,220
You're late. Quite a bit.

54
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,150
Thanks to you.

55
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:28,760
"I was stuck in traffic," "I mistook the meeting time,"

56
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,760
"There was an unforeseen accident,"

57
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,430
et cetera.

58
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:38,270
Whatever it may be, since I promised you 50 minutes of my time...

59
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:40,080
Three minutes left.

60
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,170
Make your appeal to me in three minutes.

61
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,830
Why I should work with you Team Leader Kang,

62
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:49,360
instead of Team Leader Nam.

63
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,600
The lead in that video had three DUIs and gambled overseas.

64
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,090
He's even had assault charges.

65
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,320
He was an unforgivable criminal.

66
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,320
However, he is still active in the film industry.

67
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,500
He was nominated for best actor at an international film festival with that movie.

68
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:11,520
He is also shooting lots of commercials.

69
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,800
You've got one minute left.

70
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,630
I was the one who cleaned up his past,

71
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,380
through personal branding.

72
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,700
What the people want is a toy.

73
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:34,870
I intentionally chose only the crime genre for his next projects. 
    

74
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,260
By making the people hate him freely, 
    

75
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:39,690
his public image actually improved.

76
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,020
How am I supposed to believe what you're saying right now?

77
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:48,300
He should be here any time now...

78
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,680
Here, here! Noona, I'm here!

79
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,040
She called me here!

80
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,020
Noona. Noona!

81
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:14,280
If I call for him, he comes running to me like a dog in three minutes.

82
00:06:16,633 --> 00:06:19,423
She's the one who called me to come.

83
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,770
That's entertaining.

84
00:06:21,770 --> 00:06:25,270
I want to entertain you even more, but I used up all the time you gave me.

85
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,360
Then, let's move on to the next 50 minutes.

86
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:39,370
Shall we take a walk, just the two of us?

87
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,580
Will that be okay with you?

88
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:47,640
Being seen in public while meeting privately with a particular marketer...

89
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:52,460
I am asking if you can handle what that would imply.

90
00:06:54,730 --> 00:06:56,800
Of course.

91
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:05,340
The more news coverage it gets, the better.

92
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,710
I-I like walking, too...

93
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,040
Team Leader Nam!

94
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,800
You can walk all you want on your way back to the company.

95
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:27,080
Hey, hey! Hey, Kang Na Eon... Hey!

96
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,310
Hey!

97
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,400
   

98
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,310
   

99
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,180
   

100
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,500
   

101
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,770
   

102
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:58,940
   

103
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:05,130
Isn't rebranding what you're most interested in, President?

104
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:09,380
I propose you hire Seongsu Agency for the job.

105
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,170
Sounds good.

106
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,830
I'll take up your proposal.

107
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,220
Thank you, President.

108
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,500
Also, this looks like a good place for the pop-up.

109
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,890
What do you think, Team Leader Kang Na Eon?

110
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,340
   

111
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,830
   

112
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,900
It's the ideal place to demonstrate XU Beauty's new brand image.

113
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:47,080
Well... the more news coverage it gets, the better.

114
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,810
What?

115
00:08:55,810 --> 00:08:57,260
Hey, daebak!

116
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,060
You really pulled it off?

117
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,200
First, set up a meeting with the real estate agency that handles the handmade shoe factory,

118
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,520
- instead of having a meeting with a union worker 
 - instead of a union worker...

119
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,230
- set up a meeting with someone who 
 - set up a meeting...

120
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:10,210
will be easier to convince,

121
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,800
- I should also post it on social media. 
 - Oh, right.

122
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,000
Tell the art team to revise the pop-up store concept to fit the handmade shoe factory.

123
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,010
We'll hold the meeting as planned tomorrow.

124
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:23,290
Also, we have a meeting with the director at the MK Global Marketing tonight,

125
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,750
so don't forget. 
    

126
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,780
Will fireworks be good for the emoticons?

127
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:33,540
You've been working here for several years now. Why are you taking so long with a post?

128
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,010
It's my eighth year.

129
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,510
Hey! Show me some love as your colleague!

130
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:39,790
   

131
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,580
I can only show you love if you do well.

132
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,640
Okay.

133
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,000
   

134
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,530
   

135
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,350
   

136
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:04,300
   

137
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,680
   

138
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,370
   

139
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,370
Have you seen social media?

140
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,540
Team Leader Kang managed to get an exclusive contract with XU Beauty. 
    

141
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,670
XU Beauty is the top company in South Korea.

142
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:29,710
How does she do it? She's carrying the company all by herself.

143
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,540
I know, right? Getting a contract with XU Beauty is not easy.

144
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:35,100
   

145
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,780
Team Leader Kang is amazing.

146
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:40,000
   

147
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,060
I heard that Team Leader Kang's new book is a hit.

148
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,160
- She even taped a YouTube video last week. 
 - Really?

149
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,110
At this rate, she's like a famous non-celebrity.

150
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,970
If this one goes well, she's in line to become the youngest executive.

151
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:53,700
Whoa, she's got it all.

152
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,040
Do you think Team Leader Na Eon would have any worries?

153
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,780
Not sure.

154
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:01,150
She does. She has a major worry.

155
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,650
 What could that be, Sunbaenim? 

156
00:11:07,085 --> 00:11:08,218
She has too many enemies.

157
00:11:08,218 --> 00:11:10,315
   

158
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:11,520
   

159
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,760
   

160
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,860
   

161
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,600
   

162
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,310
   

163
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:23,250
   

164
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,610
   

165
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,980
   

166
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:30,520
   

167
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,920
Na Eon!

168
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,650
What is it? Let me get some rest, too.

169
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,190
I bothered you while you were resting?

170
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:55,890
Sunbae!

171
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,620
You're already back from your vacation?

172
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,790
If I knew this would happen, I would have stayed longer.

173
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,980
There's someone who's handling the role of the CEO well, even without me.

174
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,670
Why would you say that?

175
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,580
I heard about today.

176
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:15,880
Director Han seems to be supporting Team Leader Nam.

177
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,150
That's why Team Leader Nam is messing with you, trusting in his support.

178
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:22,910
Daebak! The post on the community site was true?

179
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,850
I should post a comment on it.

180
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,620
We're both the same.

181
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,850
I also mess around, trusting your support.

182
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,860
It's been a while since I stepped away from fieldwork.

183
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:35,840
Will it be okay with XU Beauty?

184
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,650
They had a controversy about testing on animals a few years ago,

185
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,240
and I heard their CEO is no joke.

186
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,640
XU Beauty...

187
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,740
Gosh, she's right! 
    

188
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,360
Na Eon, will you be all right?

189
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,660
What if you get involved with them and lose your chance at the HQ... oh my!

190
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,540
- Yu Mi. 
 - Yeah?

191
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,850
You should just worry about yourself.

192
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,050
Sorry.

193
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:07,450
On top of that, the handmade shoe factory site is also not an easy spot for a pop-up store.

194
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:12,700
You need to accomplish something that's not easy to make a noise.

195
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:16,580
   

196
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,930
   

197
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:19,840
 - Stick together! 
 - Absolutely opposed to it! 
   

198
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,900
 All right, charge! 

199
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:28,420
 - Absolutely opposed to it! 
 - Gosh! Charge! 

200
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:30,940
 - Push, push! 
 - Absolutely opposed to it! 

201
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,700
- This won't do. Everyone, please come in this way now. 
  - Absolutely opposed to it! 

202
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:36,440
What are you doing right now? Hurry up and push!

203
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,320
All right, everyone. Go over there. Push!

204
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,240
 - Push! 
 - Absolutely opposed to it! 

205
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,470
It's already a done deal with the landlord.

206
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:45,920
We are the owners. Who did you talk to?

207
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,690
We refuse to let you in!

208
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:49,430
Hey, push!

209
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,800
- Harder! 
 - Harder!

210
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,030
What the? Eun Ho Oppa!

211
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:57,850
Hyung! Why are you over there?

212
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,950
What are you doing over there?

213
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,980
What the... Are you one of them?

214
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:04,570
Pardon? No.

215
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:07,500
I'm just an intern.

216
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,350
   

217
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,910
Absolutely against the pop-up store!

218
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:21,830
 Absolutely against it! Absolutely against it! 

219
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,500
Preserve the handmade shoe factory!

220
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:27,620
 Preserve it, preserve it! 

221
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:31,890
Absolutely against the pop-up store!

222
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:35,550
   

223
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,590
Hello! I am a rookie intern, So Eun Ho.

224
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,890
Please read through this.

225
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,610
Hello! I am a rookie intern, So Eun Ho.

226
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:49,050
Please read through this once.

227
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:52,860
Hyung, stop it! We're being punished because of you.

228
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:55,530
Hello! I am a rookie intern, So Eun Ho.

229
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,600
- Please read through this once. 
 - Can't you read the mood at all?

230
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,400
- Can't you read the mood? 
 - Hey, hey!

231
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,630
I'm two years older than you and three years older than you.

232
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,600
So, I should work five times as hard.

233
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,820
Hello! I am a rookie intern, So Eun Ho.

234
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,250
Please read through this once!

235
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,780
- Take it away from him. 
 - So Eun Ho!

236
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,950
You!

237
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:28,590
You are an intern and a member of Seongsu Agency.

238
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:32,380
This would disqualify you from being a full-timer here!

239
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,290
Look how handsome I am, but you're saying I can't become a full-timer?

240
00:15:37,290 --> 00:15:41,230
That's right. You won't. Never!

241
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:45,250
Gosh, but this is still not right, Sir.

242
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,670
I will officially protest this with Sunbae Na Eon!

243
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:50,390
G-G-Gosh! Y-Y-You are calling her Sunbae again!

244
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,830
- You're right! 
 - Call her Team Leader!

245
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,230
She was my sunbae in school and now at work too.

246
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:57,030
And even a sunbae in life!

247
00:15:57,030 --> 00:16:00,130
Can't I even call my sunbae a sunbae?

248
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:03,100
I joined this company all because of Sunbae Kang Na Eon!

249
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,050
Still, do you think Team Leader Kang would listen to an intern?

250
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,130
My Sunbae Na Eon isn't like that!

251
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:14,210
No matter how infamous she is for her bad personality,

252
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:16,250
- Hyung. 
 - being called a demon, a witch,

253
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:18,590
or a psychopath— What, what, what!

254
00:16:18,590 --> 00:16:21,250
- Stop! 
 Shut your mouth!

255
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,480
Though my Sunbae Na Eon seems to have a shitty personality,

256
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,840
- she has— 
 - No common sense!

257
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,730
No common sense!

258
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,470
She doesn't?

259
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:36,200
I don't have common sense.

260
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,910
I wonder what my Hoobaenim wants to argue about with his Sunbae,

261
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:47,280
who is a witch, a demon, a psychopath, and has a shitty personality.

262
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,350
S-Sunbae... it's not like that—

263
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:51,150
Come to my office.

264
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:57,690
Gosh, Sunbae, with so many people around...

265
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,370
What? What is it now?

266
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,490
Sunbae, even if you care for me that much,

267
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:14,960
how could you ask to see me alone in your office?

268
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:17,300
If you have nothing to say, get out.

269
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:24,020
Well, what I'm saying, is even if we do marketing we should do it nicely.

270
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,570
Since you are an educated person from the same school as me, 
    

271
00:17:28,570 --> 00:17:31,220
you should protect a domestic company.

272
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,110
Also, regarding XU Beauty,

273
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:36,820
After doing some research, I discovered many strange things about them.

274
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,760
There are rumors about how they did not use vegan ingredients,

275
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,070
and that they still test on animals.

276
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,090
There are so many problems with them—

277
00:17:44,090 --> 00:17:45,280
What problems?

278
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,900
The problem of a mere intern doing research?

279
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,500
I mean, you should read at least a page...

280
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,440
So Eun Ho!

281
00:17:56,350 --> 00:18:00,500
I can't do anything about how you were placed on my team as our first intern,

282
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:07,590
but if you are going to act all righteous on my team,

283
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,080
then don't do marketing!

284
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,510
W-Why not?

285
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,850
We can just do righteous marketing!

286
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,370
I'll wrap up the hands-on professional's special lecture.

287
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,610
 Sunbae, wait a moment! Sunbae! 

288
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:30,500
 Excuse me, excuse me. 

289
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,760
 All right. One, two, three! 

290
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,090
 I'm going to brag. 

291
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,540
 After listening to Sunbae's Kang Na Eon marketing career lecture, 

292
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,660
 I was totally moved.  
    

293
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,140
 Why marketing? 

294
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,160
 It doesn't seem to suit you. 

295
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:47,600
 I traveled a lot. 

296
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,490
 After meeting a variety of people, I realized 

297
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,610
 the good products of many 

298
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,720
 small business owners went unnoticed due to major corporation marketing. 

299
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,480
 So I wanted to try it. 

300
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,450
 Marketing that doesn't differentiate between clients. 

301
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:02,960
 You don't suit our company's style. 

302
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,490
 Why not? 

303
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:07,070
 Do they not accept nice, handsome guys? 

304
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,770
 No. 

305
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,510
 We do marketing to differentiate between clients. 

306
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:18,920
 That distinction creates a brand that millions of people love. 

307
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:25,780
 Isn't it more important for at least one person to truly love that brand? 

308
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:29,730
 People are the same. 

309
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:33,580
 It's enough to have just one person 

310
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,630
 to truly love me. 

311
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,970
In the future, come out when I call you.

312
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,220
Gosh, Sunbae. I know I'm cute, but—

313
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,380
Get out.

314
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,360
Pardon?

315
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,880
I said, leave now.

316
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,890
Oh, yes, Ma'am.

317
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:10,330
   

318
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,110
What's wrong with me?

319
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:21,740
So Eun Ho, damn it.

320
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,300
 At a glance, you could tell it was so dirty! 

321
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,350
It was so messy, and I didn't want to step inside.

322
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,670
So, I told everyone to go and open the doors!

323
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:33,330
But then I saw a familiar face inside.

324
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:37,510
There was that guy inside. That guy you had that thing with. What was his name?

325
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:40,490
Right, it was So Eun Ho. He was inside!

326
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:47,260
But he was protesting on the repairmen's side at the handmade shoe factory!

327
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:48,890
He's quite funny.

328
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:52,070
There was a lot of talk about you two when he got hired as an intern.

329
00:20:52,070 --> 00:20:55,460
They were saying it was a love-hate style romance between a team leader and an intern.

330
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:58,370
It's not romance. It's just hatred.

331
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:07,520
Let me show you the first round of drafts printed on special paper.

332
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,350
Okay.

333
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,190
It's out!

334
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:19,740
I made everything from the invitation to the pop-up with the same visual concept.

335
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,330
That's a draft designed on a special pearlescent paper.

336
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,760
It took over a month just to get that paper.

337
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,190
As expected of Cha Jeong Woo. Daebak, it's so pretty!

338
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:30,900
 Also, regarding XU Beauty. 

339
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,630
 There are rumors about how they did not use vegan ingredients, 

340
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:36,310
 and that they still test on animals. 

341
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:38,340
I'm sorry, but...

342
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,210
let's do it over.

343
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,720
With a naturalistic concept using eco-friendly materials.

344
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,820
By chance, will I receive my incentive twice?

345
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,860
You can get it as paid time off.

346
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,410
Looks like I'll have to go back to searching on LinkedIn.

347
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:57,050
Good luck.

348
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:59,420
What about dinner?

349
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:01,030
Eat with her.

350
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,260
Bye!

351
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:09,710
Jeong Woo, should we eat sashimi or that tasty BBQ place?

352
00:22:09,710 --> 00:22:12,330
I'll get to work.

353
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:15,120
I think I'll have to work late starting today.

354
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,610
Enjoy.

355
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:18,320
Okay.

356
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:24,660
Dang it. That workaholic.

357
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,270
 It feels like I'm at my grandma's. 

358
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:32,390
Hyung, how could you confront Team Leader Na Eon?

359
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:35,830
It's not a confrontation. Maybe it was a lovers' quarrel?

360
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,330
- Oh, really? 
 - No, no.

361
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:38,630
It's not.

362
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:43,130
There is a rumor that Team Leader Na Eon releases stress through men.

363
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,810
- Really? 
 - Yeah.

364
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:50,650
Eun Ho Oppa dresses crappy, but he's not too bad looks-wise.

365
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,640
I-It's a compliment, right?

366
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:57,980
Yeah. It's a compliment telling you to get rid of that crappy jacket.

367
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,290
Gosh, I haven't finished paying it off yet.

368
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:07,180
Also, I bought it not as clothing but to send out an eco-friendly, sustainable message.

369
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,700
Hyung, you wear your underwear for several days straight, right?

370
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,490
Gosh, that's not true!

371
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:14,310
Goodness, that's dirty.

372
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,050
What are you saying?

373
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,700
Oppa, if you keep confronting her like that,

374
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,520
what if you are placed in

375
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,110
Underdog after you become a full-time employee?

376
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:26,960
Underdog?

377
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:30,690
You really should come to the intern's training.

378
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:36,060
Seongsu Agency has a ranking system.

379
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:42,460
 First, there is Team 1, where Team Leader Na Eon 

380
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:46,690
 with irrefutable absolute power is. That's Diamond. 

381
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:53,860
 Team 2, where Team Leader Nam is constantly eyeing her place, 

382
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,900
 is Platinum. 

383
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:04,360
 Below that, there is the Art Team where Team Leader Na Eon's top supporter, 

384
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,230
Team Leader Cha Jeong Woo.

385
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:10,260
 Besides that, two other teams exist on their own. 

386
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,950
 And way below them, 

387
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:25,360
 there is the Underdog Team that uses a corner of the warehouse. 

388
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:30,150
 That team is Bronze. 

389
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:35,490
 The trash team of people who lost in battle. 

390
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:46,080
Team Leader Na Eon sends all the leftover trash employees there.

391
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,000
She's basically telling them to leave of their own accord.

392
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,000
- It may not be so bad to say goodbye in advance. 
 - Yeah.

393
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,810
   

394
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:14,890


395
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,680
   

396
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,950
♫  Don't call me "Of yours"  ♫

397
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:28,180
♫  I just may achieve my dream  ♫

398
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:32,460
♫  Even in the face of challenge and despair  ♫

399
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,040
♫  There's no need to stress  ♫

400
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:38,420
♫  That's my blue  ♫

401
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:46,560
♫  Just call me "Lady," don't call me "Of Yours"  ♫

402
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:54,560
♫  Just call me "Lady," don't call me "Of Yours"  ♫

403
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,870
♫  Pointy flat shoes  ♫

404
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,670
♫  Worn-out sneakers  ♫

405
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:06,920
♫  Whatever it is, I feel like I can touch the sky  ♫
