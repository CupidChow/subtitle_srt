1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:06,330
 

2
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:16,390


3
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:19,300
    

4
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:23,270
Wow, wow. Whoa.

5
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,780
No, we can't today.

6
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:27,500
The workshop is canceled. Canceled.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,510
What are you talking about? We're not canceling it.

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:32,640
Look at her face.

9
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,840
Wow, canceling will be worse.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,650
We're about to get fired.

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:40,440
What do we do then?

12
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,080
Send the bus back to the office.

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,430
   

14
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:55,030
What could we possibly do here?

15
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,920
What are you planning to do Unni?

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,820
Okay, everyone. Since it's raining today,

17
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,830
let's all have fun in the office.

18
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,190
   

19
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:21,060
   

20
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,830
   

21
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,280
   

22
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,470
 Yang Hye Ji | Kim Ho Young] 

23
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:43,600
   

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,430
Move it in here. This way. Move, move, move.

25
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,900
Try hanging it up.

26
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,650
- Like this? 
 - A little more to the side.

27
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,830
Pull it more.

28
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,920
Yes, pull it.

29
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,290
You're doing great.

30
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:01,660
This way.

31
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:04,280
Come on.

32
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,250
Gosh, this is looking great.

33
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,550
Good work, everyone.

34
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,700
Just relax here.

35
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,470
We'll let you know when the game is officially starting.

36
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,820
 - Okay!  
 - Relax, everyone.

37
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,330
Let's go.

38
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,840
   

39
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:44,230
Whoever you are, I won't let anyone in so don't waste your energy.

40
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,700
Eun Ho, I heard you're moving out.

41
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,900
Someone wants to see the apartment.

42
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,510
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

43
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,210
Hurry, hurry.

44
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,120
Peekaboo.

45
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:03,950
- What's this? 
 - Okay, get moving.

46
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:07,100
Peekaboo, Eun Ho.

47
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:10,410
Kidnapping So Eun Ho. Here we go.

48
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,980
What are you doing?

49
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,430
What are you doing right now?

50
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,270
Honey, relax a bit.

51
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:19,260
Hey, what are you doing?

52
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,550
What could it be? We're kidnapping you in broad daylight.

53
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,880
Wow. Your tent is close to mine.

54
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:46,360
Did So Eun Ho not come?

55
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,790
Why are you asking me about him?

56
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,450
I suppose.

57
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:56,160
It'd be weirder if you knew.

58
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,720
Geez, let go!

59
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,420
Let go.

60
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,910
You know this is a crime, right?

61
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,040
I know. I know.

62
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:24,900
Okay, we'll officially start the game now.

63
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,270
   

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,150
Gosh, why are you so quiet?

65
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,610
 Introduce yourself! 

66
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,740
Okay, to introduce myself...

67
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:49,060
I'm a pillar that's been here for 15 years.

68
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,270
I'm Lee Yeong Ae.

69
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,500
You're so cool!

70
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,270
Okay, the first game is...

71
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,480
called...

72
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,490
Battle Agency.

73
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:05,980
   

74
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:09,690
If there's someone you've always wanted to fight,

75
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,240
you can invite them to the ring and battle with them verbally.

76
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,800
To someone you might want to say, "I'd like to duke it out with this bastard!"

77
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,040
Or if you want to reveal your true feelings to someone

78
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,610
you can use this opportunity to tell them directly.

79
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,530
Okay, the first participant is...

80
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,400
Team Leader Cha Jeong Woo.

81
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:44,920
 Come out! Come out! 

82
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,840
- Come out! Come out! 
  - Come out! 

83
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,510
Seongsu Agency's Mr. Perfect. Team Leader Cha Jeong Woo.

84
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,360
Is there an opponent you want to battle with?

85
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,680
So Eun Ho.

86
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,310
Come out.

87
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,890
Daebak. Daebak.

88
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:11,750
 - Come out! Come out!  
 - Come out!

89
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,350
 Come out! Come out! Come out! 

90
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:16,760
 Come out! Come out! Come out! 

91
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:18,280
 Come out! Come out! 

92
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,880
 Come out! Come out! 

93
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:25,350
Hey, So Eun Ho!

94
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,420
   

95
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,520
This automatically makes Team Leader Cha Jeong Woo the winner.

96
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,040
A round of applause, please.

97
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,320
Na Eon.

98
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,030
You came, Sunbae?

99
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:04,010
Shall we talk?

100
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:10,920
It looks like the work environment has changed a lot.

101
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,230
For both you and the company.

102
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:18,100
I like it this way.

103
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,750
I've always told you to move on from the incident five years ago andâ€”

104
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,130
How did you do that?

105
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,790
Five years ago.

106
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,080
You took responsibility for everything,

107
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,920
but how were you able to hang on like this?

108
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,850
Because you were taking it so hard.

109
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,560
Sunbae,

110
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,990
because of the people who did that to us,

111
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,540
I've been hanging in there all this time.

112
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:02,090
But I suddenly had this thought.

113
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,450
The person from five years ago

114
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:09,510
might be the same one...

115
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,260
who tried to kill me.

116
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,780
Really?

117
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,560
Then who was it?

118
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:28,810
That's a good concept.

119
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,480
This is so good.

120
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:40,960
Have some coffee!

121
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,400
Yes.

122
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,280
It's so good.

123
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,410
Okay, okay, everyone.

124
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:50,650
 Yes. 

125
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,690
After the tasty dinner,

126
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:59,020
there will be an event that I have prepared.

127
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:09,290
It's called Treasure Hunt.

128
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:11,210
   

129
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,380
- Treasure Hunt? 
 - A round of applause.

130
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:22,970
Everyone, Treasure Hunt has to be played with a designated partner.

131
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:24,130
Oh, my.

132
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,750
Please reveal the partners!

133
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,220
A round of applause, please. 
    

134
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,640
Oppa, you're my partner.

135
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,270
I hope you have a pleasant time with your partner.

136
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:43,720
Treasure Hunt starts now!

137
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,470
The prize is very generous.

138
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,580
Very generous.

139
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,910
Hurry up!

140
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,530
Let's go.

141
00:09:56,900 --> 00:10:00,660
Forget it. Treasure Hunt? I'm not a kid.

142
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,620
This is a legitimate date.

143
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,360
Let's go.

144
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,160
I don't expect a lot.

145
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,900
I just wanted to say

146
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:20,800
I want to keep liking you like I did before.

147
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:25,290
What?

148
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:29,100
I just want to like you on my own. I can't even do that?

149
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,260
No, you can't.

150
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:35,340
Because one's feelings

151
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:41,090
can grow so immensely that you can't handle them.

152
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,320
So, don't.

153
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,950
How about you and So Eun Ho then?

154
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,570
We can't handle them.

155
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:57,520
Neither me nor So Eun Ho.

156
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:36,310
Oh, my God! You scared me! My goodness.

157
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:41,750
But what are you doing here?

158
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,340
I was looking for the treasure.

159
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,710
Yes, the treasure.

160
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:49,100
By the way, how could you be like this?

161
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:51,280
The Treasure Hunt was your idea.

162
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,370
How could you walk away from it like that?

163
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,800
   

164
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,100
   

165
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,320
   

166
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,930
   

167
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,730
   

168
00:12:17,730 --> 00:12:19,160
   

169
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,300
   

170
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,780
   

171
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,530
   

172
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:41,410
 Yes, Yeong Ae Sunbae. Please come to my office for a moment. 

173
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:42,720
   

174
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,490
 Scrap everything but Part 2. "Speak With Your Body." 

175
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,590
 Let's do the Treasure Hunt instead. 

176
00:12:48,590 --> 00:12:54,220
 The one where you find prizes and give them away... Treasure Hunt? 

177
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:06,060
I put you in charge because I knew you'd prepare it well.

178
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,090
I'll do my best.

179
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,770
Fighting.

180
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,920
I don't think it's here.

181
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,900
Let's go somewhere else.

182
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:25,560
- Where is it? 
 - Where did they hide it?

183
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,750
Gosh, seriously.

184
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,800
Oppa, come over here.

185
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,880
Did you find anything?

186
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:23,160
   

187
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,330
Wow.

188
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,450
- What's this? 
 - What's this? What's this?

189
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,720
I think it's a power outage.

190
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,230
Sunbae.

191
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,510
Sunbae.

192
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,350
Sunbae, are you okay?

193
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,510
Hold on a second.

194
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,860
I'll bring someone over.

195
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,860
Don't go.

196
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:29,300
Don't go, So Eun Ho.

197
00:16:43,090 --> 00:16:45,510
I can manage it myself.

198
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,940
What's wrong with you?

199
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,270
Say, "I'm struggling."

200
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,280
"I'm in pain."

201
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:21,110
Is it that hard to say?

202
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,180
You're so damn proud.

203
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,360
You just need to say it.

204
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:33,360
What happened five years ago was an accident.

205
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,760
So, you don't care

206
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:39,130
whether I leave or not. Is that it?

207
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,510
You'll be in so much pain whenever it gets dark.

208
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,440
Say, "I'm struggling."

209
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:48,530
"Stay by my side."

210
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,040
Is it really that difficult to say?

211
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,290
I...

212
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:59,770
need to hear that from you.

213
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,350
So...

214
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,590
So I can come to you.

215
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,690
I'm sorry.

216
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:31,720
I'm sorry, So Eun Ho.

217
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:37,030
Sunbae, do you know...

218
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,730
how I've felt...

219
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,520
all this time?

220
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,260
Hello.

221
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,580
I'm the new intern, So Eun Ho.

222
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,390
 No one would know. 

223
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:07,190
 I was smiling, but I was going through hell inside. 

224
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,720
 I joined Kang Na Eon's team. 

225
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:15,510
 I'll start dragging her down to the bottom now. 

226
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,720
 We might not be able to correct what's wrong, 

227
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,190
 but we don't have to cover things up for them. 

228
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:24,350
 When did that happen? 

229
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:29,320
 Fortunately, you were a worse villain than I imagined. 

230
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,360
 And pointing the sword of revenge at you was the right thing to do. 

231
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,450
 What is it that you want? 
   

232
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:37,680
 You. 

233
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,300
 I want everything, including your soul. 

234
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:49,190
 So I had to be by your side no matter what it took. 

235
00:19:52,550 --> 00:19:55,040
 And I thought it was an opportunity 

236
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,260
 when our bodies switched. 

237
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:02,590
 An opportunity to defeat Kang Na Eon. 

238
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,230
What's going on?

239
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,360
 But for some reason, 

240
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,480
 the more I got to know you, the more different you were than I thought. 

241
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,740
 I thought maybe you were a better person than I thought. 

242
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:22,640
 Go prove yourself. 

243
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,540
 I kind of like the branding work you did. 

244
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,770
 I thought maybe you're not as bad as I thought. 

245
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,730
 Do a presentation with this. 

246
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,470
 But if you weren't the villain, 

247
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:43,220
 who was responsible for all this? 

248
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,950
 If I didn't visit Segye Group that day, 

249
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:54,060
 and if I didn't run into you, 
     

250
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,850
 we wouldn't be suffering this much. 

251
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,950
 We... 

252
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,810
 wouldn't be hurting this much. 

253
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,800
To be honest,

254
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:27,260
I couldn't forgive myself.

255
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,770
That's why...

256
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:33,020
That's why I've been hanging in there with all my might.

257
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:35,530
It's not your fault.

258
00:21:36,710 --> 00:21:38,960
It's all my fault.

259
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,170
So, let's...

260
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,010
stop hurting.

261
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:55,620
I don't want you to get hurt.

262
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,980
I...

263
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:59,510
I don't want you to get hurt, either.

264
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:03,480
â™«  It belongs to you and I  â™«

265
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,890
â™«  The star we created together  â™«

266
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,230
â™«  It will always be there  â™«

267
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:16,850
â™«  Lift up your head when you're tired  â™«

268
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:20,860
â™«  This is love itself  â™«

269
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:28,800
â™«  It's what I've been keeping in my heart for a long time  â™«

270
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:33,120
â™«  You might get lost sometimes  â™«

271
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,160
â™«  You might have no one else to blame sometimes  â™«

272
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:44,680
â™«  But try to remember this moment right here  â™«

273
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,240
 Eun Ho. 

274
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,700
 What's this all of a sudden? 

275
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:56,210
 I wanted to say goodbye for the last time. 

276
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,670
 I know you're ready... 

277
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:01,860
 to let me go now. 

278
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:09,110
 Were you happy preparing revenge for five years? 

279
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:14,630
 I want you to free yourself from me 

280
00:23:15,530 --> 00:23:18,010
 and become happy. 

281
00:23:25,110 --> 00:23:29,510
â™«  Sometimes the tears build up  â™«

282
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:34,550
â™«  Even if it feels so far away  â™«

283
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:42,500
â™«  When I open my eyes, I see you  â™«

284
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:51,960
â™«  The happy moments that help me forget for a little while  â™«

285
00:23:51,960 --> 00:24:03,110
â™«  You will make me happier than anyone, and shine here  â™«

286
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,230
 See you later, So Eun Ho. 

287
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,850
Are you okay?

288
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:47,860
Yes.

289
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:51,340
You look tired.

290
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,280
I'll drive later.

291
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,920
It's fine.

292
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:08,400
What you told me yesterday...

293
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:13,170
I'm sure it was difficult for you to say.

294
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,390
I didn't say that to hang onto you.

295
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,980
I just...

296
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:29,300
said what I felt.

297
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:31,060
I know.

298
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:37,650
Therefore... I'm also thinking of doing what I feel like now.

299
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:57,140
Let me be by your side.

300
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,850
Don't look for the culprit...

301
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,550
who tried to kill you alone either.

302
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,880
Thank you.

303
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,920
To be honest,

304
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,730
I found something.

305
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,010
   

306
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:01,760
Sunbae, what's...

307
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:04,170
all this?

308
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:08,400
I think this is the original.

309
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,870
They erased their tracks.

310
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:15,380
The best way they know how.

311
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:24,950


312
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:33,140
   

313
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,090
â™«  After the wave of thoughts came to a stop  â™«

314
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:42,980
â™«  The sadness overflows  â™«

315
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:54,410
â™«  I'm holding back, my heart that overflows again with hope  â™«

316
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:57,610
â™«  After hesitating  â™«

317
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:01,390
â™«  I'm hesitating, mmm ~  â™«

318
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:07,360
â™«  The words, just flow out like this  â™«

319
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,430
â™«  My days and nights are all about you  â™«

320
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,600
â™«  So much so that I forget myself  â™«

321
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,530
â™«  So will you stay with me?  â™«
