You better go.

6
00:00:22,135 --> 00:00:23,135
No.

7
00:00:23,435 --> 00:00:26,205
You're worried about Ms. Kang.

No. I'm fine.

13
00:01:10,975 --> 00:01:12,683

Did we switch?

21
00:02:52,485 --> 00:02:54,115
I guess this doesn't work.

22
00:03:01,355 --> 00:03:02,355
Follow me.

23
00:03:03,795 --> 00:03:04,865
To the room.

24
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:11,963
What?

25
00:03:11,964 --> 00:03:13,933
Your room? Why?

26
00:03:13,934 --> 00:03:15,033
Why would we go there?

27
00:03:15,034 --> 00:03:16,434
To discuss strategies.

28
00:03:18,304 --> 00:03:21,045
If you don't want to do it, be stuck in my body forever.

29
00:03:21,304 --> 00:03:22,374
What?

30
00:03:24,145 --> 00:03:26,585
No. Give my handsome face back!

31
00:03:26,814 --> 00:03:28,385
You must be crazy.

32
00:03:41,464 --> 00:03:43,534
Drive properly, you scumbag!

33
00:03:43,835 --> 00:03:45,063
"Scumbag?"

34
00:03:45,064 --> 00:03:47,504
Darn it. Why is he acting like that? He's scary.

35
00:03:48,904 --> 00:03:51,004
- Accelerate more. - No.

36
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:54,374
This car is four times more expensive than my annual salary.

37
00:03:54,874 --> 00:03:56,915
You mean, four times more expensive than my annual salary.

38
00:03:57,714 --> 00:04:00,244
Don't be confused. You're Kang Na Eon.

39
00:04:00,945 --> 00:04:04,183
So you're paying for the repair, right?

40
00:04:04,184 --> 00:04:05,254
Speak casually.

41
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:07,484
Sorry?

42
00:04:07,485 --> 00:04:08,994
Drop the honorifics.

43
00:04:09,455 --> 00:04:10,593
Like we're friends?

44
00:04:10,594 --> 00:04:11,925
Yes. Like we're friends.

45
00:04:13,425 --> 00:04:15,064
All right, you punk.

46
00:04:15,065 --> 00:04:16,663
Hey, I haven't driven since I got my driver's license.

47
00:04:16,664 --> 00:04:18,163
I'm scared to death.

48
00:04:18,164 --> 00:04:19,603
If you're such a good driver, you should drive the car.

49
00:04:19,604 --> 00:04:21,504
I'm not your secretary.

50
00:04:21,505 --> 00:04:23,305
Am I right or wrong, you punk?

51
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:30,044
I'm sorry.

52
00:04:46,924 --> 00:04:47,995
Why?

53
00:04:50,065 --> 00:04:51,505
Get it together.

54
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:05,384
I guess the rumor is true that something is going on between them.

55
00:05:05,385 --> 00:05:06,413
Why?

56
00:05:06,414 --> 00:05:08,213
Why did they come to work together?

57
00:05:08,214 --> 00:05:09,555
They might wear the same clothes tomorrow.

58
00:05:10,114 --> 00:05:11,724
You guys also...

59
00:05:13,325 --> 00:05:15,154
- carpool. - Sorry?

60
00:05:15,654 --> 00:05:17,294
And you guys are married to someone else.

61
00:05:18,154 --> 00:05:19,224
- Well... - Well...

62
00:05:20,024 --> 00:05:21,734
No, we don't.

63
00:05:22,565 --> 00:05:24,363
Oh, my gosh.

64
00:05:24,364 --> 00:05:25,603
No.

65
00:05:25,604 --> 00:05:26,805
- It's not like that. - Is it true?

66
00:05:29,274 --> 00:05:32,544
Be quiet. You can't say something like that when you're in my body.

67
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,874
That's not my style.

68
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:39,245
Then watch and learn my style.

69
00:05:43,815 --> 00:05:44,854
Darn it.

70
00:05:46,984 --> 00:05:48,024
Okay.

71
00:05:48,895 --> 00:05:50,654
Do you remember what we talked about yesterday?

72
00:05:51,825 --> 00:05:52,864
Yes.

73
00:05:54,524 --> 00:05:55,793
I forgot because of anxiety.

74
00:05:55,794 --> 00:05:57,163
Does your brain even have wrinkles?

75
00:05:57,164 --> 00:05:58,234
Come on.

76
00:06:00,104 --> 00:06:02,334
You should say only pretty things with pretty lips.

77
00:06:02,335 --> 00:06:03,375
Repeat after me.

78
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:14,684
- I'll take full responsibility... - I'll take full responsibility...

79
00:06:14,685 --> 00:06:16,414
- and volunteer... - and volunteer...

80
00:06:17,654 --> 00:06:20,825
Let me join Team Underdog.

81
00:06:29,364 --> 00:06:31,294
You don't have to talk about work first.

82
00:06:31,565 --> 00:06:34,065
- Are you all right? - Yes.

83
00:06:41,145 --> 00:06:42,844
I'm fine.

84
00:06:43,614 --> 00:06:44,945
I'll do my best.

85
00:06:47,484 --> 00:06:49,685
Did she hurt her head when she fell?

86
00:06:49,984 --> 00:06:51,784
I think she went a little crazy.

87
00:06:56,294 --> 00:06:57,325
Na Eon.

88
00:06:58,195 --> 00:07:01,194
It's the entire Seongsu Agency that should take responsibility,

89
00:07:01,195 --> 00:07:03,934
- not just you, so... - She thinks she can handle it.

90
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,305
There's no reason to stop her.

91
00:07:07,835 --> 00:07:09,403
She caused the scandal.

92
00:07:09,404 --> 00:07:11,375
She can't be reinstated in her post as the manager of Team One anyway.

93
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,404
Don't you agree?

94
00:07:14,075 --> 00:07:16,575
She's right.

95
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,515
The position isn't for anyone.

96
00:07:31,495 --> 00:07:33,325
We have two goals.

97
00:07:36,395 --> 00:07:37,463
First.

98
00:07:37,464 --> 00:07:38,765
(Our goals)

99
00:07:40,034 --> 00:07:42,134
Find the person who tried to kill me.

100
00:07:42,135 --> 00:07:45,104
Second, win back my place.

101
00:07:46,375 --> 00:07:47,375
They...

102
00:07:48,474 --> 00:07:51,145
are your goals, not ours.

103
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:54,044
It's the first time...

104
00:07:55,015 --> 00:07:56,315
you used your brain.

105
00:08:01,055 --> 00:08:02,354
If you help me,

106
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:04,825
I'll try...

107
00:08:05,895 --> 00:08:06,964
to switch our bodies back.

108
00:08:09,995 --> 00:08:11,495
Something is not right.

109
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:15,205
Isn't it also good for you if we switch bodies back?

110
00:08:16,075 --> 00:08:17,304
No, it isn't.

111
00:08:17,305 --> 00:08:19,544
Being in a man's body might make it easier for me...

112
00:08:20,075 --> 00:08:21,205
to become an executive.

113
00:08:22,945 --> 00:08:25,884
Yes! This house is mine now!

114
00:08:25,885 --> 00:08:27,145
Yes!

115
00:08:35,695 --> 00:08:37,094
What should I do first?

116
00:08:38,795 --> 00:08:42,065
First, become the manager of Team Underdog.

117
00:08:44,695 --> 00:08:47,405
That way, we can stick together 24 hours...

118
00:08:48,104 --> 00:08:51,175
and have the freedom to find the culprit.

119
00:08:52,004 --> 00:08:54,844
But if it's 24 hours,

120
00:08:57,974 --> 00:08:59,384
do I get overtime pay too?

121
00:09:10,825 --> 00:09:11,925
For the time being,

122
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:15,364
I'll work hard as the manager of Team Underdog.

123
00:09:19,464 --> 00:09:21,564
I guess you're finally grasping the situation...

124
00:09:21,565 --> 00:09:23,575
after the video was released.

125
00:09:24,335 --> 00:09:27,044
They say colleagues should help one another.

126
00:09:27,045 --> 00:09:28,674
As your colleague who has known you for a while,

127
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:30,744
I'll give Team Underdog a project to work on at least.

128
00:09:31,275 --> 00:09:32,685
I'm different from you.

129
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:34,915
Gosh, thank you, ma'am.

130
00:09:39,655 --> 00:09:42,155
"Sex toys..."

131
00:09:42,455 --> 00:09:43,494
"for women?"

132
00:09:48,494 --> 00:09:49,795
Show us what you've got.

133
00:09:50,894 --> 00:09:51,964
Oh, my.

134
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:54,035
Well...

135
00:10:00,344 --> 00:10:02,275
"Due to the recent scandal,"

136
00:10:02,744 --> 00:10:04,344
"her salary will be cut for six months,"

137
00:10:04,614 --> 00:10:06,544
"and she will be appointed as the manager of Team Underdog."

(Redeployment Notice)

139
00:10:08,585 --> 00:10:09,655
I'm quitting.

140
00:10:09,854 --> 00:10:11,454
Thank you for everything.

141
00:10:11,455 --> 00:10:13,884
Thank you, and I love you. And I'll miss you. I love...

142
00:10:14,325 --> 00:10:16,954
Lex, you still have to pay your monthly installment for your bag.

143
00:10:16,955 --> 00:10:18,253
Go back to your place.

144
00:10:18,254 --> 00:10:21,124
This darn Chanel.

145
00:10:21,264 --> 00:10:23,493
Eun Ho, what do we do now?

146
00:10:23,494 --> 00:10:26,435
You won't be able to act like the manager when she comes.

147
00:10:26,634 --> 00:10:27,664
It's a pity.

148
00:10:27,665 --> 00:10:29,874
I've never acted like the manager.

149
00:10:30,205 --> 00:10:33,003
Oh, my. You shouldn't lie.

150
00:10:33,004 --> 00:10:34,674
"Do this, do that."

151
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,275
You were so sexy.

152
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:39,884
Stop joking around and keep your guard up.

153
00:10:40,585 --> 00:10:43,984
You know Ms. Kang isn't an ordinary woman.

154
00:10:47,655 --> 00:10:49,594
Na Eon.

155
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:55,594
- Na Eon? - What?

156
00:10:59,634 --> 00:11:01,565
Oh, my gosh.

157
00:11:06,545 --> 00:11:08,144
You useless piece of trash.

00:11:12,415 --> 00:11:13,585
(Eun Ho's desk)

159
00:11:13,785 --> 00:11:16,584
Gosh, they say a change in your position brings a change in you.

160
00:11:16,585 --> 00:11:20,325
A manager is a very nice position.

161
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:22,055
My gosh.

162
00:11:22,525 --> 00:11:24,493
The cushion is very soft.

163
00:11:24,494 --> 00:11:25,524
(Im Do Yoon, the CEO of Girlish)

164
00:11:25,525 --> 00:11:27,093
Stay still, will you?

165
00:11:27,094 --> 00:11:28,525
It's a very nice photo.

166
00:11:29,565 --> 00:11:30,695
Very nice.

167
00:11:33,535 --> 00:11:35,274
What's up with Ms. Kang?

168
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:36,733
Why does she look so naive?

169
00:11:36,734 --> 00:11:39,575
She used to have a horrible personality.

170
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:40,804
Tell me about it.

171
00:11:40,805 --> 00:11:43,415
I guess the rude woman is onto something new.

172
00:11:43,614 --> 00:11:45,915
Which photo is better? Left or right?

173
00:11:48,114 --> 00:11:49,213
The right one.

174
00:11:49,214 --> 00:11:50,815
It's definitely the right one.

175
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,955
What do you think, sweetheart?

176
00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:56,254
Can I run away if she asks us to have lunch together?

177
00:11:57,955 --> 00:12:00,594
What kind of chair is this?

178
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:07,634
Read the message.

179
00:12:13,874 --> 00:12:15,174
This is cool.

180
00:12:15,175 --> 00:12:18,343
- Being a manager is so cool. - "Horrible personality?"

181
00:12:18,344 --> 00:12:19,415
"Rude?"

182
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:25,555
Let me rest for a moment.

183
00:12:26,585 --> 00:12:28,025
(Invite Ms. Kang Na Eon)

00:12:31,594 --> 00:12:34,264
Oh, my gosh. Hey, you can't invite her!

187
00:12:36,795 --> 00:12:37,994
Sorry?

188
00:12:40,305 --> 00:12:43,103
My gosh. I was invited to the group chat.

189
00:12:43,104 --> 00:12:44,134
Thank you.

190
00:12:44,634 --> 00:12:46,075
Welcome.

191
00:12:46,275 --> 00:12:47,275
I'm excited.

192
00:12:49,545 --> 00:12:51,274
Let's have lunch together later.

193
00:12:51,275 --> 00:12:52,643
It sounds amazing.

194
00:12:52,644 --> 00:12:53,914
Do you want to go to the place I know?

195
00:12:53,915 --> 00:12:55,184
I know an all-you-can-eat Korean restaurant...

196
00:12:55,185 --> 00:12:56,753
near the office. It's just five dollars.

197
00:12:56,754 --> 00:12:58,154
And their food is amazing.

198
00:12:58,155 --> 00:12:59,684
I'm definitely going.

199
00:12:59,685 --> 00:13:01,753
We're definitely going.

200
00:13:01,754 --> 00:13:03,353
- Yes! - You're the best.

201
00:13:03,354 --> 00:13:05,925
- Yes! - Come on.

202
00:13:06,224 --> 00:13:07,695
It makes me so happy.

203
00:13:07,825 --> 00:13:09,835
My image is ruined.

204
00:13:10,295 --> 00:13:13,004
That's why you shouldn't say, "Piece of trash" with my mouth.

205
00:13:17,335 --> 00:13:18,335
You should do better.

206
00:13:28,984 --> 00:13:30,354
(Blue and white that resembles a diamond)

207
00:13:41,325 --> 00:13:43,535
What you prepared is trash.

208
00:13:44,035 --> 00:13:47,133
Which part do you not like?

209
00:13:47,134 --> 00:13:49,535
Everything! All of it!

210
00:13:50,275 --> 00:13:51,874
Start over from the beginning.

211
00:13:52,104 --> 00:13:53,444
- Yes. - Yes.

212
00:13:53,445 --> 00:13:55,175
Let's go.

213
00:13:56,275 --> 00:13:57,275
My gosh.

214
00:14:12,464 --> 00:14:15,565
Didn't you say you would handle Kang Na Eon?

215
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,064
The prime suspect as of now.

216
00:14:53,065 --> 00:14:54,065
(Do Yoo Mi)

217
00:14:54,066 --> 00:14:55,805
- Do Yoo Mi. - What?

218
00:14:56,435 --> 00:14:58,103
Ms. Do?

219
00:14:58,104 --> 00:15:00,274
There's no way.

220
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:02,744
She tried to kill someone because of jealousy?

221
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:05,984
Just to become a manager?

222
00:15:06,214 --> 00:15:07,983
It's not just a manager.

223
00:15:07,984 --> 00:15:09,983
It's the position with the biggest power in Seongsu Agency.

224
00:15:09,984 --> 00:15:11,055
Sure.

225
00:15:15,055 --> 00:15:16,724
There are people like that.

226
00:15:17,055 --> 00:15:18,695
People who do anything...

227
00:15:19,525 --> 00:15:20,924
to get what they want.

228
00:15:20,925 --> 00:15:23,264
Are you talking...

229
00:15:23,364 --> 00:15:25,665
about yourself?

230
00:15:29,405 --> 00:15:30,474
I'm sorry.

231
00:15:31,604 --> 00:15:33,643
But you guys were friends.

232
00:15:33,644 --> 00:15:36,444
Friends argue while getting closer.

233
00:15:36,445 --> 00:15:37,545
My gosh.

234
00:15:38,675 --> 00:15:40,614
I don't have friends.

235
00:15:41,384 --> 00:15:42,655
I can tell.

236
00:15:45,214 --> 00:15:46,525
This won't do.

237
00:15:47,185 --> 00:15:48,655
I should be your friend.

238
00:15:49,455 --> 00:15:50,754
Give me your hand.

239
00:15:52,724 --> 00:15:56,234
Here. Take it.

240
00:16:04,305 --> 00:16:06,305
I'm sorry, but don't fall for me.

241
00:16:12,514 --> 00:16:13,944
Come on.

242
00:16:13,945 --> 00:16:16,184
You didn't even eat anything today.

243
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:17,955
All you drink is coffee and alcohol.

244
00:16:18,455 --> 00:16:20,223
Are you trying to kill my body?

245
00:16:20,224 --> 00:16:21,883
This is my way to stay focused.

246
00:16:21,884 --> 00:16:23,994
Come on. This won't do.

247
00:16:24,555 --> 00:16:26,195
- Let's go. - Where?

248
00:16:26,624 --> 00:16:28,464
Let's go. Bring your credit card.

249
00:16:28,665 --> 00:16:30,294
- No. - Hurry up and come out.

250
00:16:30,295 --> 00:16:31,694
- Hey. - Come out quickly.

251
00:16:31,695 --> 00:16:33,103
Where are we going?

252
00:16:33,104 --> 00:16:34,405
Somewhere.

253
00:16:51,085 --> 00:16:53,724
(Na Eon)

254
00:16:56,754 --> 00:16:59,124
- It's raining. - It's raining.

255
00:16:59,695 --> 00:17:01,964
It's right over there. Let's go.

256
00:17:01,965 --> 00:17:03,163
It's a rainy day.

257
00:17:03,164 --> 00:17:04,995
So I'll make green onion pancakes for you.

258
00:17:05,265 --> 00:17:07,304
- We need flour... - Just use this.

259
00:17:07,305 --> 00:17:08,305
So Eun Ho?

260
00:17:09,374 --> 00:17:11,305
Oh, my gosh. What's this?

261
00:17:11,634 --> 00:17:12,943
A black card?

262
00:17:12,944 --> 00:17:14,775
I've never seen a black card in person.

263
00:17:15,745 --> 00:17:17,174
Be gentle with it.

264
00:17:22,144 --> 00:17:23,255
Gosh.

265
00:17:23,985 --> 00:17:24,985
We need more.

266
00:17:25,924 --> 00:17:26,924
Okay.

267
00:17:30,354 --> 00:17:32,364
Wait for me.

268
00:17:32,495 --> 00:17:34,594
Hey.

269
00:17:35,124 --> 00:17:36,164
Listen.

270
00:17:37,335 --> 00:17:38,734
Whether we catch the culprit...

271
00:17:38,735 --> 00:17:40,034
or switch bodies again,

272
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:42,934
we should eat first.

273
00:17:43,904 --> 00:17:45,235
We could order food delivery.

274
00:17:50,245 --> 00:17:53,285
Do you know how bad disposable containers are for the environment?

275
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,085
My goodness.

276
00:17:56,914 --> 00:17:58,954
Why has my stomach been hurting since earlier?

277
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:01,954
It's strange.

278
00:18:04,025 --> 00:18:05,295
What's the date today?

279
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:09,364
It's 18th.

280
00:18:10,495 --> 00:18:11,535
It is.

281
00:18:24,914 --> 00:18:25,944
(Organic cotton cover pads)

282
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:37,295
No way.

283
00:18:43,894 --> 00:18:46,465
It won't be, right?

284
00:18:46,904 --> 00:18:49,174
A man can't... It's not that, right?

285
00:19:07,684 --> 00:19:09,025
The dressing is nice.

286
00:19:11,295 --> 00:19:13,825
That was made by me too.

287
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:17,065
Hey. Don't touch someone else's food. It's dirty.

288
00:19:17,535 --> 00:19:19,904
What? How is it your food?

289
00:19:20,164 --> 00:19:21,505
And we're not "someone else."

290
00:19:21,765 --> 00:19:24,005
You are me, and I am you.

291
00:19:24,904 --> 00:19:27,075
Gosh. My stomach hurts.

292
00:19:27,475 --> 00:19:28,545
My goodness.

293
00:19:29,075 --> 00:19:30,315
How long does it last?

294
00:19:31,015 --> 00:19:32,315
A week at most.

295
00:19:34,644 --> 00:19:35,644
Just hang on a little.

296
00:19:40,354 --> 00:19:42,085
You went through a lot.

297
00:19:44,694 --> 00:19:46,194
Living a life like this.

298
00:19:51,295 --> 00:19:52,404
Eun Ho.

299
00:19:55,404 --> 00:19:56,434
Why?

300
00:20:03,045 --> 00:20:05,173
So what are you going to do with the branding?

301
00:20:05,174 --> 00:20:08,414
My gosh. You're such a workaholic.

302
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:10,414
Give it to me.

303
00:20:14,325 --> 00:20:16,054
When you were working for XU Beauty,

304
00:20:16,055 --> 00:20:17,894
you talked about sincerity, acting all high-and-mighty.

305
00:20:18,295 --> 00:20:19,394
But you lost confidence now.

306
00:20:19,664 --> 00:20:20,965
What on earth are you good at?

307
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:24,495
I can come up with amazing names for plants.

308
00:20:24,694 --> 00:20:27,505
- I named this one... - That's useless.

309
00:20:28,835 --> 00:20:30,275
You should get the project done properly this time.

310
00:20:32,805 --> 00:20:33,844
Do Yoo Mi.

311
00:20:34,904 --> 00:20:36,644
If we shake her when she drops her guard,

312
00:20:36,914 --> 00:20:38,215
it'll be easy to make her collapse.

313
00:20:38,575 --> 00:20:40,884
So you're certain...

314
00:20:41,414 --> 00:20:43,555
that she's the culprit.

315
00:20:43,755 --> 00:20:46,225
No. She can't do it by herself.

316
00:20:46,755 --> 00:20:48,954
There must be someone else.

317
00:20:54,725 --> 00:20:56,094
When she collapses,

318
00:20:58,434 --> 00:21:00,005
they will show themselves.

319
00:21:04,835 --> 00:21:05,904
Gosh.

320
00:21:06,575 --> 00:21:07,575
What's wrong with you?

321
00:21:09,275 --> 00:21:11,844
Fine. I'll do my best.

322
00:21:12,144 --> 00:21:15,215
But I don't know much about it...

323
00:21:16,085 --> 00:21:17,755
to do my best.

324
00:21:22,454 --> 00:21:26,295
No marketer does something she's good at only.

325
00:21:30,934 --> 00:21:31,965
Darn it.

326
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:34,204
Meet the CEO first.

327
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,904
The brand identity...

328
00:21:36,204 --> 00:21:39,134
comes from the person who created the brand in the end.

329
00:21:42,404 --> 00:21:43,475
Where are you going?

330
00:21:44,315 --> 00:21:45,344
Not your business.

331
00:21:57,894 --> 00:21:59,565
"The brand identity..."

332
00:22:00,664 --> 00:22:03,235
"comes from the person who created the brand."

333
00:22:09,505 --> 00:22:11,575
It's just like what you said, Da Eun.

334
00:22:19,315 --> 00:22:22,113
I'm proud...

335
00:22:22,114 --> 00:22:24,684
that we're making toys...

336
00:22:24,985 --> 00:22:28,484
for satisfying orgasms...

337
00:22:28,485 --> 00:22:30,294
of sexy...

338
00:22:30,295 --> 00:22:32,825
and passionate women.

339
00:22:34,624 --> 00:22:37,494
I hope that kind of brand image...

340
00:22:37,495 --> 00:22:39,505
stands out well.

341
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:40,704
Gosh.

342
00:22:41,265 --> 00:22:44,204
An extremely sensual...

343
00:22:45,374 --> 00:22:47,444
and private...

344
00:22:48,475 --> 00:22:49,943
world...

345
00:22:49,944 --> 00:22:51,344
(World)

346
00:22:52,344 --> 00:22:53,515
of our own.

347
00:22:57,684 --> 00:23:01,154
- I see. - "Sensual."

348
00:23:01,624 --> 00:23:02,694
"And private."

349
00:23:03,454 --> 00:23:06,194
I'm so curious.

350
00:23:07,164 --> 00:23:08,863
- Gosh. - I don't like the light.

351
00:23:08,864 --> 00:23:09,864
My gosh.

352
00:23:10,664 --> 00:23:12,765
Is your store in the basement?

353
00:23:12,965 --> 00:23:16,604
Women are a little shy...

354
00:23:17,235 --> 00:23:19,035
about buying sex toys.

355
00:23:19,235 --> 00:23:20,274
Right?

356
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:21,505
Pardon? No.

357
00:23:22,505 --> 00:23:25,914
I'm not sure. I don't really use them.

358
00:23:26,444 --> 00:23:28,884
My husband lasts very long.

359
00:23:29,354 --> 00:23:31,585
I'm a mother of five.

360
00:23:32,315 --> 00:23:34,054
- All of them are boys. - Goodness.

361
00:23:34,055 --> 00:23:36,054
Hey, that's totally uncalled for.

362
00:23:36,055 --> 00:23:38,054
- Is it? - My goodness.

363
00:23:38,055 --> 00:23:41,093
If you think going to the store...

364
00:23:41,094 --> 00:23:43,394
will help,

365
00:23:44,864 --> 00:23:46,364
would you like to go with me?

366
00:23:48,735 --> 00:23:50,335
Our secret desire...

367
00:23:51,275 --> 00:23:52,904
that is concealed...

368
00:23:54,204 --> 00:23:58,444
and oppressed.

369
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,684
To the unknown world.

370
00:24:10,025 --> 00:24:12,555
- Gosh. - "The unknown world."

371
00:24:13,864 --> 00:24:14,924
Doesn't it sound good,

372
00:24:18,934 --> 00:24:19,934
Ms. Kang?

373
00:24:22,535 --> 00:24:23,604
Right.

374
00:24:28,775 --> 00:24:31,315
Let's go to the unknown world.

375
00:24:41,924 --> 00:24:45,693
This product got the Korea Certification mark,

376
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:49,325
which means its safety is approved.

377
00:24:51,194 --> 00:24:52,364
As this...

378
00:24:53,805 --> 00:24:56,634
is for penetration,

379
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:01,174
it completely blocks electromagnetic radiation.

380
00:25:03,414 --> 00:25:06,585
It will safely take you...

381
00:25:08,485 --> 00:25:10,354
to paradise.

382
00:25:11,684 --> 00:25:13,025
- Gosh. - Gosh.

383
00:25:13,884 --> 00:25:14,884
Amazing.

384
00:25:15,884 --> 00:25:17,893
That's why I call this boy,

385
00:25:17,894 --> 00:25:20,065
Goblin.

386
00:25:21,065 --> 00:25:22,124
It's a goblin's magic wand.

387
00:25:22,864 --> 00:25:24,564
Goblin?

388
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:25,933
- Goblin. - Goblin.

389
00:25:25,934 --> 00:25:28,604
Goblin, I missed you.

390
00:25:28,904 --> 00:25:30,775
Goblin.

391
00:25:31,275 --> 00:25:32,335
It's a good name.

392
00:25:32,704 --> 00:25:34,804
Lex, make sure to take as many pictures as possible...

393
00:25:34,805 --> 00:25:35,873
to create images.

394
00:25:35,874 --> 00:25:37,545
- I was looking. - Take a look at this.

395
00:25:38,674 --> 00:25:39,744
Young Ae, make a list...

396
00:25:39,745 --> 00:25:41,815
of the characteristics and prices of each product.

397
00:25:43,315 --> 00:25:44,484
As for Jenny...

398
00:25:44,485 --> 00:25:46,353
A sly fox-cat.

399
00:25:46,354 --> 00:25:48,154
Oh, my gosh.

400
00:25:49,085 --> 00:25:50,525
Keep doing the live broadcast.

401
00:25:51,795 --> 00:25:53,295
- It's so fascinating. - Eun Ho.

402
00:25:53,694 --> 00:25:55,264
Ms. Kang is here.

403
00:25:55,265 --> 00:25:56,965
Are you still acting like a manager?

404
00:26:01,904 --> 00:26:02,904
You're right.

405
00:26:03,535 --> 00:26:05,904
Eun Ho. Be careful.

406
00:26:07,644 --> 00:26:08,704
Answer me.

407
00:26:12,144 --> 00:26:14,744
He's immature.

408
00:26:14,745 --> 00:26:16,485
This place made him shy and embarrassed.

409
00:26:17,184 --> 00:26:18,884
- That must be the reason. - Okay.

410
00:26:19,085 --> 00:26:22,853
I should teach him a lesson.

411
00:26:22,854 --> 00:26:25,153
Oh, my. Go easy on him.

412
00:26:25,154 --> 00:26:27,065
Why are you so upset? My gosh.

413
00:26:32,094 --> 00:26:33,134
Eun Ho.

414
00:26:34,805 --> 00:26:36,575
Na Eon. I was quite good, wasn't I?

415
00:26:38,704 --> 00:26:40,244
You should compliment me.

416
00:26:40,245 --> 00:26:41,805
I'm enduring the stomachache instead of you.

417
00:26:45,374 --> 00:26:46,384
Did you take the medicine?

418
00:26:46,884 --> 00:26:48,015
I took two pills earlier.

419
00:26:49,555 --> 00:26:50,614
Well done.

420
00:26:54,025 --> 00:26:55,085
By the way,

421
00:26:55,555 --> 00:26:59,254
you split up the work between them very clearly.

422
00:26:59,255 --> 00:27:02,124
I thought you would show no interest.

423
00:27:02,465 --> 00:27:03,664
It's not an interest.

424
00:27:04,134 --> 00:27:05,934
I just distributed the work based on their capabilities.

425
00:27:06,265 --> 00:27:08,604
Of course. I got it.

426
00:27:09,874 --> 00:27:11,904
Gosh, what's that now?

427
00:27:30,594 --> 00:27:31,594
What?

428
00:27:32,725 --> 00:27:34,094
Where did he go?

429
00:27:40,235 --> 00:27:42,104
Gosh, what's this?

430
00:27:54,344 --> 00:27:55,344
Oh, my.

431
00:27:59,114 --> 00:28:01,454
Gosh. That surprised me.

432
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:12,193
My goodness.

433
00:28:12,194 --> 00:28:13,805
What's this?

434
00:28:19,035 --> 00:28:21,374
My goodness, you startled me.

435
00:28:25,844 --> 00:28:26,884
What?

436
00:28:27,644 --> 00:28:29,444
Did you run because you were worried about me?

437
00:28:37,094 --> 00:28:40,364
Gosh. I didn't know there was something like this too.

438
00:28:41,025 --> 00:28:42,164
It's interesting.

439
00:28:44,634 --> 00:28:46,065
My gosh.

440
00:28:52,575 --> 00:28:54,274
Hey. Unlock it.

441
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:55,704
- It's done. - What are you doing?

442
00:28:55,975 --> 00:28:58,444
Hey. Unlock it.

443
00:28:58,775 --> 00:29:01,114
I will if you listen to me.

444
00:29:02,954 --> 00:29:04,414
- Unlock it. - I don't want to.

445
00:29:04,654 --> 00:29:06,623
- Unlock it. - No.

446
00:29:06,624 --> 00:29:08,424
No.

447
00:29:33,785 --> 00:29:35,943
