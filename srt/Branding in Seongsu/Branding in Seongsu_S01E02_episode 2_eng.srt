1
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:07,550
   

2
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,050
Let's eat something tasty.

3
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:17,190
- Sounds good. 
 - Spaghetti sounds so good!

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:23,950


5
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:26,110
   

6
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,170
Yes?

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,200
Sunbaenim, sexual assault by wielding your power is a crime—

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,870
 Come to Room 1 on the 37th floor. 

9
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:44,870
But I'm wearing yesterday's underwear right now.

10
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:55,760
   

11
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,500
   

12
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,400
   

13
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,840
   

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,030
   

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:22,230
   

16
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:41,960
Well, I...

17
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:51,760
I heard rumors that your moisturizing cream has a non-vegan, animal-based oil. You know?

18
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:58,930
Those types of rumors always seem to follow 
    

19
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:01,200
whenever anyone becomes successful. 
    

20
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,230
"Maybe it isn't really vegan,"

21
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,790
or "How did they become a global company without animal testing?"

22
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:11,260
When I think about this guy, I could not use such ingredients.

23
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:16,300
We love our animal friends.

24
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:20,420
Gosh. Do you also personally participate in research, President?

25
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,960
Of course. I started as a researcher.

26
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,850
Wow...

27
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,880
Do I look like a partier?

28
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,290
O-Oh, no, no.

29
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,750
He's amazing.

30
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:45,940
P-Please drink your tea.

31
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,600
I'm sorry...

32
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,000
- for trusting my handsome face and stepping out of line. 
 - Are you crazy?

33
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:08,140
But, I may be a potential consumer, a future customer of his product.

34
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,860
- So... 
 - I see.

35
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,220
Even though it's for women?

36
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,300
Why do you think that I don't have a girlfriend?

37
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:21,240
It would be more believable to say you would be buying it to use yourself.

38
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:28,400
In any case, I want to do my job with a sense of duty.

39
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:35,350
I want the product I am selling to be harmless to animals and people alike.

40
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,760
So Eun Ho.

41
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,980
A sense of duty is something you should have when you are the one paying.

42
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:44,740
Young geezer.

43
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,350
Get out.

44
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:51,360
Here?

45
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,880
Sunbae, but we're on a bridge.

46
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,560
You really want me to get out here?

47
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:08,480
Sunbae, this is workplace abuse!

48
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:21,450
 Visit the factory tomorrow. 
   

49
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,250
The factory?

50
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,020
I told her not to turn off the lights.

51
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,760
   

52
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,870
 Yes, Ma'am? 

53
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,720
Don't come to work starting tomorrow.

54
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,460
 Pardon? 

55
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:03,060
 What are you saying suddenly at this time of night? 

56
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:23,080
 Thanks to you, I finished my workout for the day. 

57
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:26,540
 But you're going with me to the factory, right, Sunbae? 

58
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,470
 By chance, are you asking me out on a date? 

59
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,650
Crazy bastard.

60
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:52,910
Good morning.

61
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,000
 Whoppa! 

62
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,900
   

63
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,120
   

64
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,490
 Let's welcome Team Leader Kang Na Eon! 

65
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,460
 My name is Kang Na Eon, and I am a Marketing Team Leader 

66
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,750
 at Seongsu Agency. I've worked as a Brand Marketer for 8 years. 

67
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,320
 Wow! 

68
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:38,020
 What is brand marketing in your opinion, Team Leader? 

69
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:41,560
 Marketing is differentiation. 

70
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:45,630
 It is making a distinction between those who consume your brand and those who don't. 

71
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:49,700
 I believe that differentiation is marketing. 

72
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,470
Board meeting? 
    

73
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,220
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Sorry.

74
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,240
Right.

75
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,840
Drink up and grow!

76
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,470
I'm off.

77
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,170
   

78
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:35,090
   

79
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,790
Sunbae!

80
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:50,350
I'll be right there!

81
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,100
♫  That brief moment  ♫

82
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,850
Sunbae...

83
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:35,080
Sexual assault by wielding your power is—

84
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:39,620
Sunbae! If you were going to catch me, you should...

85
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,820
catch me properly.

86
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,290
How did you know I was here?

87
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:50,140
I saw it on the shared calendar.

88
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,650
Why is the intern who should be at the factory here?

89
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,400
So, I can see you before I go, Sunbaenim.

90
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,110
Now that you saw me, go then.

91
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,050
Gosh, don't be like that.

92
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:09,400
We even went to a hotel together yesterday!

93
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,970
If you have something to say, make it quick.

94
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:22,020
Well, there really aren't any problems with XU Beauty, right?

95
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,310
You even met the CEO yesterday.

96
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:29,240
Do you need something else?

97
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:34,320
Could you go so far as to bet your soul on it?

98
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,810
My soul?

99
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:44,480
Sure. Why not?

100
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,430
Okay.

101
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:51,260
Then, if I go to the factory and discover something while working hard—

102
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:54,570
I really hope you do, okay?

103
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:04,330
Since it's pretty far, you should take care of yourself.

104
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,340
What do you mean, it's far? The factory?

105
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:10,100
Sunbae!

106
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,010
What? 
    

107
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,780
It's in Jangpyeong, Gangwon-do?

108
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:22,230
Whoa, seriously!

109
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,080
   

110
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,170
 I'll have a nice Gangwon-do trip! 

111
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,120
 Sunbae, fighting! And fighting for me, too! 

112
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,380
Crazy bastard.

113
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,630
   

114
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,850
Who is it? Your boyfriend?

115
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:36,340
Have you ever seen me dating?

116
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,660
That's nothing to brag about.

117
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:46,600
Have you looked into XU Beauty a bit?

118
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:51,510
Regardless of what I find out, it is more important to fix it.

119
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,900
Na Eon, there is no need to overextend yourself.

120
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,270
If there is a risk, avoiding it is also a valid method.

121
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:00,830
If you don't, you'll end up like me.

122
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,530
Sunbae.

123
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,840
We promised to never avoid things again.

124
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:14,440
We should rise... all the way to the top.

125
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,470
Hello. 
    

126
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,480
How have you been?

127
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,920
Did you wrap up the first FP  (Full Page)  well?

128
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,410
I've heard about what happened with XU.

129
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,790
I heard you stole my Team Leader Nam's contract.

130
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:39,840
Steal?

131
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,260
Isn't that out of line?

132
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,400
I'll take it as a compliment for a job well done.

133
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,440
But isn't today a management executive meeting?

134
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,630
I'm curious as to why a non-executive is here.

135
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:55,050
Hey, what about you?

136
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:03,630
If that's the case, aren't you also not allowed to be here, Team Leader Kang?

137
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:06,220
I tend to cross the line, you know.

138
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,100
You are quite funny.

139
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,390
If you keep acting like that,

140
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:20,420
it's only a matter of time before you lose all your limbs and are left in the dust.

141
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,080
Just like the Director next to you.

142
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:28,460
- What did you just say? 
 - Stop.

143
00:13:32,690 --> 00:13:39,110
So, I heard that the pop-up location is the site of the first handmade shoe factory in Seongsu-dong.

144
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,750
Aren't you wasting your time here if you want to obtain that location?

145
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,090
My team members are working hard

146
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:46,830
to get it done.

147
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,410
   

148
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,550
It's really out in the boonies.

149
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,560
Whoa...

150
00:14:37,070 --> 00:14:39,960
Whoa, whoa. Slowly!

151
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,060
Look over here and turn.

152
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,110
Aigoo, aigoo.

153
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:46,050
Are you all right?

154
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:47,200
I'm sorry.

155
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:49,420
It's completely destroyed. It's okay, it's okay. You can get off.

156
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,900
- I'm sorry. 
 - No, no.

157
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,030
Help me carry this.

158
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,580
It's heavy.

159
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,170
You really didn't have to come.

160
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:01,650
I know. My Team Leader loves me too much.

161
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,510
But the factory is quite well-organized.

162
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,910
Oh, you've got a good eye.

163
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:11,020
We run a periodic visitation system.

164
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,050
Since we have nothing to hide.

165
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,660
There, there. Aigoo, aigoo...

166
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:19,510
All right.

167
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:27,150
But do you also use dry hay when making cosmetics?

168
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,970
That's for testing ingredients for our product.

169
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,440
Hey, Eun Ho.

170
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,120
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

171
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,100
We are about to have black bean noodles—

172
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,550
I'll have an eggplant fried rice.

173
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,160
- Could I also order mapo tofu? 
 - Of course.

174
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,840
Let's go.

175
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,890
   

176
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,980
 Mapo tofu. I'm so lucky. 
   

177
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,980
 Thanks to you, I'm having a feast! Thank you. 

178
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,930
 Yum! It's so tasty. 

179
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,930
He sure is having fun.

180
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,630
Yes, President.

181
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:44,360
You know that guy who came with you yesterday?

182
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,110
He won't be a problem, right?

183
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,540
Thanks to you.

184
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,660
It seems like he's become a fan after meeting you yesterday.

185
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:56,500
But I'm not into guys, though.

186
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,070
But...

187
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,620
XU Beauty really doesn't have any problems, right?

188
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,850
 Is that important? 

189
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:08,960
 Soon, 

190
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,960
I'll have a luncheon meeting with the vice chairman of Segye Group.

191
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,580
I will speak very highly of you to him,

192
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:18,800
 Team Leader Kang Na Eon. 

193
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:22,020
Isn't this what's important?

194
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:26,490
That is important. Very important.

195
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:30,600
Then, you should prepare well for this.

196
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,600
Thank you.

197
00:18:06,170 --> 00:18:07,820
You made it.

198
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,290
Well...

199
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,360
It's pretty neat.

200
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,310
I think we can go with this one for the public.

201
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:19,220
And go with this one for the VIP celebrities?

202
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,810
Make only a small batch.

203
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:23,970
Since scarcity creates value.

204
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,540
I wish all my team members were like you.

205
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,360
No.

206
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,760
Let me be the rare one.

207
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,820
But Na Eon...

208
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,920
What if it can get even more special than this?

209
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,000
XU Beauty that contains the ocean.

210
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:03,320
Their main product is a moisturizing cream made with deep ocean water, so I brainstormed a bit.

211
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,220
I like it.

212
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,660
Talking about me?

213
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,070
Or the concept?

214
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,290
The concept.

215
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,930
Also Cha Jeong Woo, as an employee.

216
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:27,820
But why don't you date anyone?

217
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:31,630
Hurry up and date someone before I come onto you more.

218
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,830
Jeong Woo.

219
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,380
Yeah?

220
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,740
I think we can use this.

221
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:51,050
You're talking about work again.

222
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,330
Gosh, where?

223
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:55,610
Let's go with this concept.

224
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:57,690
You understood what I said, right?

225
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,090
Okay.

226
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,340
I'll be back later.

227
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,480
All right.

228
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:23,480
   

229
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,640
What the...

230
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,020
Why is a photo of me...

231
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,830
Jeong Woo!

232
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,620
Why are you ignoring my message?

233
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,760
- Yu Mi. 
 - Yeah?

234
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,710
Why is your profile pic a picture of me?

235
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:47,520
That is a multi-profile. Only you can see that.

236
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,970
XU Beauty...

237
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,760
If you are done, do you want to grab some food together?

238
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,260
Do Yu Mi.

239
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,830
Let's not blur the lines between friendship and something else.

240
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:09,700
   

241
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,660
Hey, I heard you will lose 3 kgs per week if you take this.

242
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,110
Give me a break. You believe that stuff?

243
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:30,780
It's true!

244
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,960
Maraheukdang Girls advertise it.

245
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,580
Hey, would a major corporation lie to you?

246
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,800
Definitely not.

247
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,750
- You really should take some. 
 - Come on.

248
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,750
Yeah, I have no choice but to try believing them. 
    

249
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,450
Anyone there?

250
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:01,570
Excuse me.

251
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,910
Is anyone there?

252
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:17,340
Excuse me.

253
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,960
I came to get my phone.

254
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,480
I am not a thief.

255
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,160
Keep your head on straight, So Eun Ho.

256
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,140
 Also, regarding XU Beauty... 

257
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,420
 After doing some research, I discovered many strange things about them. 

258
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,820
 There was a controversy about testing on animals a few years ago. 

259
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:55,440
 If there is a risk, avoiding it is also a valid method. 

260
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:58,990
 XU Beauty really doesn't have any problems, right? 

261
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,510
 Is that important? 

262
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:03,820
 Then, if I go to the factory and discover something while working hard— 

263
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,350
 I really hope that you do, okay? 

264
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:11,240
 The more news coverage it gets, the better. 

265
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:17,280


266
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:24,040
 Let's start with a question. 

267
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,650
 You want to be the top in the industry, 

268
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:29,830
 but you have funds and models similar to your competitors. 

269
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:33,970
 How can you become the winner in that situation? 

270
00:26:35,370 --> 00:26:40,540
 Does anyone know how to beat a rival company that is similar to you? 

271
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:44,270
 Hey you, the late student. 

272
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,580
 - Me? 
 - Do you want to try answering it? 

273
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,460
 W-Well, I'm not late. 

274
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,360
 It's supposed to start at 2 p.m., and it's 1:55 p.m. right now. 

275
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:59,730
 All right. You probably are thinking about how someone who was late is busy making excuses. 

276
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:03,260
 Even though that student isn't actually late. 

277
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,230
 The more I think about it, 

278
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:09,160
 I feel even more wronged. 

279
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,730
 What did you say, late student? 

280
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,700
 What's your name? 

281
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,620
 It's So Eun Ho. 

282
00:27:23,510 --> 00:27:25,350
   

283
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:29,790
♫  Just call me "Lady", not "someone's so-and-so"  ♫

284
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:31,890
♫  Don't call me "Of yours"  ♫

285
00:27:31,890 --> 00:27:35,010
♫  I just may achieve my dream  ♫

286
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:39,310
♫  Even in the face of challenge and despair  ♫

287
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:41,870
♫  There's no need to stress  ♫

288
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:44,640
♫  That's my blue  ♫

289
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:53,390
♫  Just call me "Lady," don't call me "Of Yours"  ♫

290
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:01,480
♫  Just call me "Lady," don't call me "Of Yours"  ♫

291
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,850
♫  Pointy flat shoes  ♫

292
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,440
♫  Worn-out sneakers  ♫

293
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:13,620
♫  Whatever it is, I feel like I can touch the sky  ♫
