Choose the best presentation.

6
00:00:06,916 --> 00:00:09,186
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

7
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,095
- Who are you? - I'm the new marketer, So Eun Ho.

8
00:00:16,856 --> 00:00:19,226
Our new guy is quite feisty.

9
00:00:21,865 --> 00:00:23,595
Then let's see your presentation.

10
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:26,235
What should we do with Segye Soju?

11
00:00:26,606 --> 00:00:28,375
Should we go with it or stop?

12
00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:30,575
You should stop.

13
00:00:30,945 --> 00:00:32,005
What?

14
00:00:33,246 --> 00:00:34,246
Hey.

15
00:00:35,376 --> 00:00:36,745
What are you doing?

16
00:00:36,746 --> 00:00:39,085
(Segye Soju Rebranding Meeting)

17
00:00:40,786 --> 00:00:42,485
Gosh, he came prepared.

18
00:00:42,486 --> 00:00:44,115
- He's using that? - He's so hot.

19
00:00:45,286 --> 00:00:48,556
Last year, 1 adult consumed 53 bottles of soju on average.

20
00:00:48,856 --> 00:00:51,295
That equals 397 glasses.

21
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:54,496
A total of 2,290 million bottles were sold last year.

22
00:00:54,895 --> 00:00:57,395
However, compared to all other types of alcoholic beverages,

23
00:00:57,706 --> 00:00:59,706
the number of sales have dropped to around 20 percent.

24
00:01:00,236 --> 00:01:02,605
Segye Soju which was launched last year...

25
00:01:03,036 --> 00:01:04,945
only sold four percent of that number.

26
00:01:08,115 --> 00:01:10,985
This year's sales is expected to be minus 120 percent...

27
00:01:10,986 --> 00:01:12,084
compared to last year.

28
00:01:12,085 --> 00:01:14,816
If this continues, next year's market share...

29
00:01:15,385 --> 00:01:17,385
will become two percent.

30
00:01:17,956 --> 00:01:19,486
This is why you should stop.

31
00:01:19,555 --> 00:01:21,495
Hey, are you out of your mind?

32
00:01:23,495 --> 00:01:24,596
You have a point.

33
00:01:24,995 --> 00:01:28,894
However, that's the destiny of a latecomer...

34
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:30,966
to enter the red ocean.

35
00:01:31,536 --> 00:01:35,004
I dived in on purpose knowing to get shattered.

36
00:01:35,005 --> 00:01:36,005
Why?

37
00:01:36,006 --> 00:01:38,104
It's because my heart to protect K-soju...

38
00:01:38,105 --> 00:01:39,144
is genuine.

39
00:01:39,145 --> 00:01:40,345
Wine or whisky?

40
00:01:40,346 --> 00:01:42,376
Allowing those drinks to take over our market?

41
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,445
I'm against that. Soju comes first.

42
00:01:47,286 --> 00:01:49,555
A genuine heart and passion.

43
00:01:52,885 --> 00:01:55,355
Those things won't free you from becoming a loser.

44
00:01:58,725 --> 00:02:00,664
I think our Sexy Beast...

45
00:02:00,665 --> 00:02:02,735
is doing this to bring Team One down.

46
00:02:02,736 --> 00:02:03,894
- Right. - Right.

47
00:02:03,895 --> 00:02:06,306
So you're telling me...

48
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,876
to stop?

49
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:10,776
Stop...

50
00:02:12,246 --> 00:02:13,505
and play the next game.

51
00:02:15,475 --> 00:02:18,846
(Premiumization and relaunch)

52
00:02:21,415 --> 00:02:22,455
Replay?

53
00:02:23,985 --> 00:02:25,556
Through a relaunch based on premiumization,

54
00:02:26,526 --> 00:02:30,325
I will renew Segye Soju to become a top brand.

55
00:02:31,596 --> 00:02:32,626
That's...

56
00:02:33,996 --> 00:02:35,665
a very offensive offer.

57
00:02:39,306 --> 00:02:40,306
Great.

58
00:02:41,205 --> 00:02:43,575
So that was Team One's presentation.

59
00:02:44,105 --> 00:02:45,605
This is a competition.

60
00:02:45,846 --> 00:02:47,444
So why don't we hear from Ms. Kang's team as well?

61
00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:49,746
- What? - But...

62
00:02:50,646 --> 00:02:53,444
Well, I...

63
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:55,854
No. Not from you, Ms. Kang.

64
00:02:55,855 --> 00:02:58,855
Let's hear from...

65
00:02:59,385 --> 00:03:01,096
- the youngest one. - Hey.

66
00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:04,295
- Sorry? - That makes things balanced.

67
00:03:06,066 --> 00:03:09,295
I don't know much because I don't drink.

68
00:03:11,966 --> 00:03:14,005
How old is...

69
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:16,735
our youngest?

70
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:19,204
I'm 20.

71
00:03:19,205 --> 00:03:21,646
Oh, so you're a special employee with a high school diploma?

72
00:03:21,846 --> 00:03:22,915
What?

73
00:03:23,945 --> 00:03:28,085
You see, I'm not really interested...

74
00:03:28,086 --> 00:03:30,656
if our special employee...

75
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,686
drinks or not.

76
00:03:33,355 --> 00:03:35,695
Why can't you get the point of the question?

77
00:03:36,996 --> 00:03:38,096
Is this because you're a high school graduate?

78
00:03:39,366 --> 00:03:41,694
Director Hwang, what you just said was a bit...

79
00:03:41,695 --> 00:03:46,805
Gosh, this team will never be a match for Team One.

80
00:03:46,806 --> 00:03:47,975
We have an old lady here.

81
00:03:48,735 --> 00:03:50,004
- A gay guy here. - My gosh.

82
00:03:50,005 --> 00:03:51,005
And a high school graduate?

83
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:53,604
You're going too far.

84
00:03:53,605 --> 00:03:55,515
I'm being too generous.

85
00:03:56,015 --> 00:03:57,215
I'm trying to give you bonus points...

86
00:03:57,216 --> 00:03:58,885
since this team has a handicap.

87
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:01,014
What our team needs right now isn't bonus points, but...

88
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:02,954
You old fart with smelly feet!

89
00:04:02,955 --> 00:04:04,985
Get yourself some socks!

90
00:04:06,385 --> 00:04:07,385
Jenny!

91
00:04:07,485 --> 00:04:09,455
- Jenny! - Jenny!

92
00:04:13,526 --> 00:04:14,565
What was that?

93
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:16,935
I thought Gen Zers were mentally strong.

94
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,605
Was that something to cry about?

95
00:04:20,036 --> 00:04:21,536
What do you think, Gen Zer?

96
00:04:25,105 --> 00:04:26,105
Right.

97
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:27,975
Is this...

98
00:04:29,245 --> 00:04:30,315
something to cry about?

99
00:04:32,286 --> 00:04:33,315
Right?

100
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,785
Then until Thursday,

101
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:39,725
prepare a presentation on how to make Segye Soju...

102
00:04:40,086 --> 00:04:41,495
the best brand in the liquor market.

103
00:04:41,756 --> 00:04:43,925
The winner takes the Pass necklace

104
00:04:44,096 --> 00:04:45,625
Make sure to answer the call

105
00:04:48,365 --> 00:04:49,365
Good luck.

Gosh, your makeup is all ruined.

111
00:05:34,646 --> 00:05:36,345
Stop crying!

112
00:05:36,346 --> 00:05:38,914
Oh, Jenny. Our sweet Jenny will have to understand him.

113
00:05:38,915 --> 00:05:39,915
Yes.

114
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,554
Why would I understand him?

115
00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:43,315
It was that jerk's fault!

116
00:05:45,026 --> 00:05:47,724
I'm going to upload it on social media...

117
00:05:47,725 --> 00:05:50,295
that I went through workplace harassment!

118
00:05:51,266 --> 00:05:52,965
Oh, my. Don't do that.

119
00:05:52,966 --> 00:05:55,595
Doing that will just be your loss.

120
00:05:55,596 --> 00:05:56,766
Hey, old lady!

121
00:05:57,295 --> 00:05:59,136
Whose side are you on?

122
00:06:00,435 --> 00:06:02,304
You're just pretending to be on my side with just words!

123
00:06:02,305 --> 00:06:04,006
What an old fart!

124
00:06:04,475 --> 00:06:06,375
- Let her be. - "Old lady?"

125
00:06:06,776 --> 00:06:08,575
Hear this little punk talk.

126
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:10,675
Hey, am I your friend?

127
00:06:10,846 --> 00:06:12,244
I may look young,

128
00:06:12,245 --> 00:06:14,586
but I'm 20 years older than you, you little wench!

129
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:16,515
Look young, my foot!

130
00:06:16,516 --> 00:06:18,554
You look at least 30 years older than me!

131
00:06:18,555 --> 00:06:20,385
Gosh, this is so annoying!

132
00:06:20,386 --> 00:06:21,424
Oh, gosh.

133
00:06:21,425 --> 00:06:23,554
- Gosh. - Gosh. Jenny!

135
00:06:24,665 --> 00:06:27,065

Do you also think...

140
00:06:34,466 --> 00:06:36,135
I look 20 years...

141
00:06:36,136 --> 00:06:38,505
No, 30 years older than her?

142
00:06:38,506 --> 00:06:41,076
Gosh. What's the point of fighting between ourselves?

143
00:06:41,475 --> 00:06:44,615
Our enemy is... Right there!

144
00:06:54,256 --> 00:06:55,256

See me for a while.

Gosh.

148
00:07:16,276 --> 00:07:18,216
What's with you all of a sudden?

149
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:23,555
I don't know what's going through your head.

150
00:07:23,815 --> 00:07:26,655
If you're going to team up with Yoo Mi, go ahead.

151
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:28,596
But why bring us into this?

152
00:07:30,855 --> 00:07:33,295
I got Underdog a chance to get a task.

153
00:07:34,165 --> 00:07:35,195
What's wrong with that?

154
00:07:35,196 --> 00:07:36,965
- Na Eon! - What?

155
00:07:36,966 --> 00:07:38,905
If you had that sort of plan,

156
00:07:38,906 --> 00:07:41,065
wouldn't it be nice to tell me about it?

157
00:07:41,706 --> 00:07:43,635
We can't even do that between us?

158
00:07:43,636 --> 00:07:46,305
Us? What do we have between us?

159
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:47,706
We...

160
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:53,886
We're...

161
00:07:54,346 --> 00:07:55,956
How should I put it?

162
00:07:57,485 --> 00:07:58,555
Well...

00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,756
(Do Yoo Mi)

164
00:08:03,495 --> 00:08:04,495
What?

165
00:08:08,065 --> 00:08:10,165
Okay. I'll be there by 7pm.

166
00:08:12,036 --> 00:08:14,506
I'll see you later, Yoo Mi.

167
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:17,336
"Yoo Mi?"

168
00:08:18,475 --> 00:08:19,506
Darn it.

169
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:21,875
I'm going to date Cha Jung Woo too!

170
00:08:23,615 --> 00:08:25,846
Darn it. What's wrong with her?

171
00:08:50,136 --> 00:08:52,276
All right. The start of branding.

172
00:08:52,506 --> 00:08:54,545
Let's start with our market research!

173
00:08:55,376 --> 00:08:58,075
One's rude, and one's slow-witted.

174
00:08:58,146 --> 00:08:59,246
Exactly.

175
00:08:59,915 --> 00:09:00,915
What?

176
00:09:01,656 --> 00:09:03,385
Come on!

177
00:09:03,386 --> 00:09:06,324
It hasn't even been a week since the Girlish pop-up store.

178
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:07,626
Must we really have to do this?

179
00:09:07,856 --> 00:09:09,496
I have a show later.

180
00:09:09,955 --> 00:09:10,996
I agree!

181
00:09:11,195 --> 00:09:13,025
Say no to night shifts!

182
00:09:13,026 --> 00:09:14,126
No!

183
00:09:14,595 --> 00:09:15,835
Listen up.

184
00:09:16,236 --> 00:09:18,965
We have to get together for Jenny.

185
00:09:19,006 --> 00:09:20,006
Jenny?

186
00:09:20,136 --> 00:09:22,405
If it's for her, I want out even more.

187
00:09:22,406 --> 00:09:24,074
I felt so offended by her.

188
00:09:24,075 --> 00:09:27,275
Come on! What's up with you, Young Ae?

189
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:29,945
Let's get going! Let's go.

190
00:09:30,315 --> 00:09:31,516
Let's go home!

191
00:09:33,986 --> 00:09:35,016
(Chanisul)

192
00:09:36,156 --> 00:09:37,315
(Like the Last Time)

193
00:09:37,955 --> 00:09:39,026
(Sunro is Good)

194
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:41,455
(Sunro is Good)

195
00:09:41,996 --> 00:09:43,156
(Like the Last Time)

196
00:09:46,026 --> 00:09:47,465
I just checked.

197
00:09:47,766 --> 00:09:50,095
Segye Soju is the least popular.

198
00:09:50,496 --> 00:09:51,834
A bowl of naengmyeong, please!

199
00:09:51,835 --> 00:09:54,135
- Shall we clink our glasses first? - Gosh.

200
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:55,335
Cheers!

201
00:09:55,736 --> 00:09:56,876
More side dishes, please.

202
00:09:57,935 --> 00:09:58,944
It's bitter.

203
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:01,106
Segye Soju is definitely the most bitter.

204
00:10:01,246 --> 00:10:03,844
No way. Princess, you're telling me you can tell the difference?

205
00:10:03,845 --> 00:10:06,214
Hey, sis. Of course, I can.

206
00:10:06,215 --> 00:10:08,045
I'm totally a sommelier.

207
00:10:08,415 --> 00:10:09,455
Check this out.

208
00:10:10,415 --> 00:10:13,286
Like the Last Time has a bit of sourness.

209
00:10:13,486 --> 00:10:14,726
(Remember our last moment in this glass, Like the Last Time)

210
00:10:14,856 --> 00:10:17,924
And Chanisul has a sweet aftertaste.

211
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:19,125
(The purer clean soju, the magical dewdrop, Chanisul)

212
00:10:19,126 --> 00:10:21,636
But these days,

213
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:23,835
I only drink Sunro is Good.

214
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:25,335
This one tastes the cleanest.

215
00:10:25,435 --> 00:10:27,065
(The original soju, the smoothness is great!, Sunro is Good)

216
00:10:27,266 --> 00:10:30,506
So sojus have different tastes?

217
00:10:30,805 --> 00:10:31,976
Of course!

218
00:10:32,246 --> 00:10:33,746
No way!

219
00:10:34,006 --> 00:10:35,375
Keep your eyes closed. You're unbelievable.

220
00:10:35,376 --> 00:10:36,775
Sis, do you have trouble believing people?

221
00:10:36,776 --> 00:10:38,944
Come on. You don't think I can guess them right?

222
00:10:38,945 --> 00:10:40,085
Mix them up well.

223
00:10:46,356 --> 00:10:47,356
Open your eyes.

224
00:10:47,986 --> 00:10:49,026
Let's go.

225
00:10:57,536 --> 00:11:00,065
You naughty one. You can't fool my tongue.

226
00:11:00,906 --> 00:11:02,175
This is Segye Soju.

227
00:11:03,435 --> 00:11:04,435
Unbelievable!

228
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:09,175
What?

229
00:11:09,176 --> 00:11:10,344
It was Sunro is Good.

230
00:11:10,345 --> 00:11:12,445
What? You're lying!

231
00:11:12,685 --> 00:11:14,485
Sunro is Good can't be this bad.

232
00:11:14,486 --> 00:11:15,515
Something's wrong.

233
00:11:15,516 --> 00:11:19,955
So it's hard for the consumers to tell the difference by taste.

234
00:11:20,955 --> 00:11:22,954
Then why is it not popular?

235
00:11:22,955 --> 00:11:25,425
- A bottle of soju, please! - There must be a reason.

236
00:11:28,335 --> 00:11:29,636
(Segye Soju)

237
00:11:29,866 --> 00:11:32,266
That person got Segye Soju.

238
00:11:34,435 --> 00:11:35,934
He was right. Seeing how things are,

239
00:11:35,935 --> 00:11:37,574
it really is four percent.

240
00:11:37,575 --> 00:11:39,475
Shall we ask why he ordered Segye Soju?

241
00:11:39,476 --> 00:11:40,476
Shall we?

242
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:42,516
What is it?

243
00:11:43,315 --> 00:11:45,285
My gosh! What's this all about?

244
00:11:45,286 --> 00:11:46,515
In, 1, 2, 3.

245
00:11:46,516 --> 00:11:48,085
- Hello. - Hello.

246
00:11:48,415 --> 00:11:51,625
We're in the middle of our liquor market research.

247
00:11:51,626 --> 00:11:53,285
You just chose Segye Soju.

248
00:11:53,286 --> 00:11:56,126
We wanted to know why you chose Segye Soju.

249
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:57,454
Segye Soju?

250
00:11:57,455 --> 00:11:58,664
(Segye Soju)

251
00:11:58,665 --> 00:12:01,595
What? Excuse me.

252
00:12:02,295 --> 00:12:04,934
How can you give us this when we asked for some soju?

253
00:12:04,935 --> 00:12:07,335
I'm sorry. I'll get you Chanisul instead.

254
00:12:11,376 --> 00:12:13,574
Gosh. It's packed.

255
00:12:13,575 --> 00:12:15,116
Look at all that stock.

256
00:12:16,815 --> 00:12:17,815
We're done for.

257
00:12:18,845 --> 00:12:20,945
We're done for.

258
00:12:31,455 --> 00:12:34,726
(Take good care of the Segye Soju project.)

259
00:12:39,866 --> 00:12:40,935
I was quite surprised.

260
00:12:41,536 --> 00:12:43,906
I didn't think we'd ever meet again with all your pride.

261
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:47,776
I wasn't the one that wanted to see you.

262
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:49,876
Is that so?

263
00:12:50,616 --> 00:12:52,786
I don't know who it is, but they're quite rude.

264
00:12:55,415 --> 00:12:58,016
Did he get this from Na Eon?

265
00:12:58,116 --> 00:12:59,656
Why is he so late?

266
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,295
Right.

267
00:13:04,126 --> 00:13:06,095
The guy that wanted to see you...

268
00:13:06,425 --> 00:13:07,526
is Na Eon's boyfriend...

269
00:13:14,506 --> 00:13:15,675
There he is.

270
00:13:26,415 --> 00:13:27,415
So Eun Ho!

271
00:13:29,085 --> 00:13:30,085
Over here.

272
00:13:30,856 --> 00:13:32,885
You wanted us to get together.

273
00:13:32,886 --> 00:13:35,195
How could you be the one to be this late?

274
00:13:35,526 --> 00:13:37,755
I guess he doesn't want to side with you.

275
00:13:37,756 --> 00:13:39,766
I do.

276
00:13:41,795 --> 00:13:44,235
All right. This is So Eun Ho.

277
00:13:44,236 --> 00:13:45,834
He's Seongsu Agency's new...

278
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:47,866
I live with Ms. Kang Na Eon.

279
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:51,136
I thought this would be a better introduction.

280
00:13:58,175 --> 00:13:59,545
What are you doing with me right now?

281
00:14:00,116 --> 00:14:02,286
I'm making a business offer.

282
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:07,256
Our Segye Soju...

283
00:14:07,756 --> 00:14:08,955
will be relaunched.

284
00:14:09,455 --> 00:14:11,595
It will be Nam Yoon Hyuk's personal liquor brand.

285
00:14:12,496 --> 00:14:15,335
Hey, you can't be telling him everything like that.

286
00:14:15,795 --> 00:14:16,795
Listen.

287
00:14:17,165 --> 00:14:19,204
I have been offered to be the main model...

288
00:14:19,205 --> 00:14:20,965
of a foreign whisky brand.

289
00:14:21,435 --> 00:14:23,376
Even with the relaunch,

290
00:14:24,075 --> 00:14:26,406
do you think I'll use my face...

291
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:28,075
for some bottom-tier soju?

292
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:29,376
It'll be 300,000 dollars.

293
00:14:31,045 --> 00:14:32,286
If that's not enough,

294
00:14:34,986 --> 00:14:36,015
it'll be 500,000 dollars.

295
00:14:36,016 --> 00:14:37,156
Are you kidding me?

296
00:14:37,685 --> 00:14:40,485
You must have learned something off of Kang Na Eon.

297
00:14:40,486 --> 00:14:43,125
Money isn't the only answer.

298
00:14:43,126 --> 00:14:44,555
We're not offering it to you.

299
00:14:49,595 --> 00:14:50,736
We want you to pay.

300
00:14:51,665 --> 00:14:53,935
- What? - It isn't over yet.

301
00:14:54,636 --> 00:14:56,006
The incident that was covered...

302
00:14:56,805 --> 00:14:57,876
by Na Eon.

303
00:14:58,006 --> 00:14:59,674
We'll keep that a secret.

304
00:14:59,675 --> 00:15:02,075
And we'll let you join the relaunch.

305
00:15:03,175 --> 00:15:06,385
Hey, are you looking down on me since you're with Na Eon?

306
00:15:06,386 --> 00:15:08,444
What's wrong with you guys?

307
00:15:08,445 --> 00:15:10,356
So Eun Ho, you're going too far.

308
00:15:10,415 --> 00:15:11,715
I am looking down on you.

309
00:15:11,986 --> 00:15:13,756
You're being dragged around like a dog...

310
00:15:14,156 --> 00:15:15,755
because you can't even deal with Kang Na Eon.

311
00:15:15,756 --> 00:15:16,794
You punk!

312
00:15:16,795 --> 00:15:19,026
Aren't we all here for the same reason?

313
00:15:21,866 --> 00:15:23,095
To bring down Kang Na Eon.

314
00:15:36,146 --> 00:15:37,876
You said you were Na Eon's boyfriend.

315
00:15:39,445 --> 00:15:41,185
Your love quarrel sounds quite big.

316
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:47,455
Do you really think you can beat Kang Na Eon?

317
00:15:50,955 --> 00:15:52,165
I am...

318
00:15:57,295 --> 00:15:58,335
quite...

319
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:00,406
strong.

320
00:16:33,236 --> 00:16:35,065
I never play to lose.

321
00:16:36,805 --> 00:16:38,075
I won't be losing either.

322
00:17:01,465 --> 00:17:03,335
This prick.

323
00:17:08,635 --> 00:17:09,676
Gosh.

324
00:17:16,776 --> 00:17:17,845
But you.

325
00:17:19,446 --> 00:17:21,186
You strangely look familiar.

326
00:17:21,585 --> 00:17:22,655
I do?

327
00:17:25,055 --> 00:17:27,786
Those eyes that look down on me.

328
00:17:31,595 --> 00:17:33,325
It reminds me of Kang Na Eon...

329
00:17:46,105 --> 00:17:47,175
What's that?

330
00:17:47,176 --> 00:17:48,645
(Actor Nam Yoon Hyuk's personal liquor brand model contract)

331
00:17:49,446 --> 00:17:50,446
Hey!

332
00:17:56,286 --> 00:17:58,726
Is this even allowed?

333
00:18:00,726 --> 00:18:01,726
Nam Yoon Hyuk...

334
00:18:04,196 --> 00:18:05,996
has no other way out anyway.

335
00:18:12,365 --> 00:18:13,365
What about you?

336
00:18:13,706 --> 00:18:15,206
Are you all right?

337
00:18:25,276 --> 00:18:26,686
Gosh. Hey, So Eun Ho!

338
00:18:27,716 --> 00:18:29,956
Hey, So Eun Ho!

339
00:18:33,155 --> 00:18:34,226
Hey!

340
00:18:35,526 --> 00:18:36,555
Hey!

341
00:18:37,055 --> 00:18:38,925
This is just the start for us.

342
00:18:38,926 --> 00:18:41,064
This is just the start. Let's do this!

343
00:18:41,065 --> 00:18:42,235
I was feeling super stressed.

344
00:18:42,236 --> 00:18:45,404
- Let's get this over with. - Great.

345
00:18:45,405 --> 00:18:50,104
My gosh! My sis is raising the sales for Segye Soju.

346
00:18:50,105 --> 00:18:52,044
- Gosh. - I can't believe you.

347
00:18:52,045 --> 00:18:54,475
To be honest, I don't get why people drink.

348
00:18:54,476 --> 00:18:59,645
Come on. How can you not drink when you're working in a company?

349
00:18:59,845 --> 00:19:00,845
That's no good!

350
00:19:00,846 --> 00:19:05,555
Gosh. Everyone seems passionate about this project.

351
00:19:05,786 --> 00:19:07,384
We're the passionate ones.

352
00:19:07,385 --> 00:19:10,354
- We never stop! - We never stop!

353
00:19:10,355 --> 00:19:11,426
We never stop!

354
00:19:15,595 --> 00:19:16,595
Gosh.

355
00:19:16,596 --> 00:19:18,065
Goodness. What is this?

356
00:19:18,706 --> 00:19:22,134
We never stop drinking.

357
00:19:22,135 --> 00:19:23,634
Get over here. Here.

358
00:19:23,635 --> 00:19:24,935
Gulp!

359
00:19:24,936 --> 00:19:26,775
- Gulp it down! - Hey!

360
00:19:26,776 --> 00:19:28,814
- Princess! - Gulp!

361
00:19:28,815 --> 00:19:31,144
- Well done! - You're too harsh.

362
00:19:31,145 --> 00:19:32,446
She did perfectly fine.

363
00:19:32,686 --> 00:19:35,384
This is why I drink soju.

364
00:19:35,385 --> 00:19:37,385
- What? - This is why I love it.

365
00:19:40,655 --> 00:19:41,825
I want to go there.

366
00:19:44,456 --> 00:19:47,666
What? Isn't that Jenny?

367
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,166
Jenny?

368
00:19:49,996 --> 00:19:51,065
She's with a guy.

369
00:19:51,135 --> 00:19:53,635
He looks a lot older than her.

370
00:19:54,305 --> 00:19:57,535
She left her job because she felt upset.

371
00:19:57,536 --> 00:19:59,605
Now, she's drinking? My gosh.

372
00:20:06,615 --> 00:20:07,645
I can't believe this.

373
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:12,325
I wouldn't come this high up even if I was a taxi driver.

374
00:20:13,486 --> 00:20:14,526
Gosh.

375
00:20:16,595 --> 00:20:17,595
What?

376
00:20:19,226 --> 00:20:22,236
So Eun Ho. That's your house, right?

377
00:20:22,595 --> 00:20:24,395
Please tell me it is!

378
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:27,766
You're so darn heavy!

379
00:20:39,045 --> 00:20:40,085
What?

380
00:20:40,486 --> 00:20:43,986
Gosh. What is all this?

381
00:20:45,115 --> 00:20:48,456
You looked so cute with a few drinks.

382
00:20:48,895 --> 00:20:51,695
I'm going to post this.

383
00:20:51,696 --> 00:20:53,696
Tell me your ID so I can tag you.

384
00:20:54,496 --> 00:20:55,695

(So Eun Ho)

386
00:21:06,105 --> 00:21:08,575
My goodness. You're not picking up?

387
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:14,345
Darn it. My phone's dead.

388
00:21:26,226 --> 00:21:27,295
What?

389
00:21:32,436 --> 00:21:33,736
That's scaring me.

390
00:21:34,206 --> 00:21:36,335
Gosh. I should get home.

391
00:21:45,815 --> 00:21:46,885
Who was that?

392
00:21:50,486 --> 00:21:53,026
Someone was right there.

393
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:54,756
Gosh.

394
00:22:00,395 --> 00:22:01,496
Who's that over there?

395
00:22:03,095 --> 00:22:05,736
I just saw you.

396
00:22:05,905 --> 00:22:07,635
Oh, gosh.

397
00:22:10,135 --> 00:22:13,575
You must be looking down on me since I'm a girl.

398
00:22:13,905 --> 00:22:17,416
I'm not just any type of girl.

399
00:22:17,676 --> 00:22:21,016
There's something amazing inside me.

400
00:22:22,016 --> 00:22:23,716
Come out! Where are you?

401
00:22:25,286 --> 00:22:26,456
Gosh.

402
00:22:33,125 --> 00:22:34,125
Gosh.

403
00:22:37,595 --> 00:22:38,766
Jung Woo?

404
00:22:40,405 --> 00:22:41,565
Jung Woo?

405
00:22:41,905 --> 00:22:44,405
Oh, Mr. Cha?

406
00:22:44,976 --> 00:22:46,006
Mr. Cha?

407
00:22:52,176 --> 00:22:53,246
What?

408
00:23:03,355 --> 00:23:04,426
Here.

409
00:23:04,526 --> 00:23:06,526
Hey, your shoes! Gosh!

410
00:23:10,936 --> 00:23:11,996
My bed.

411
00:23:12,335 --> 00:23:13,365
Right.

412
00:23:19,805 --> 00:23:20,875
Gosh!

413
00:23:24,545 --> 00:23:25,686
I'm exhausted.

414
00:23:35,726 --> 00:23:37,726
This place really doesn't suit you.

415
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:47,736
My gosh.

416
00:23:48,335 --> 00:23:49,635
Gosh.

417
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:00,845
What?

418
00:24:02,355 --> 00:24:03,385
What is it?

419
00:24:03,956 --> 00:24:07,385
Well, our hands are like this.

420
00:24:09,256 --> 00:24:10,256
Oh, gosh.

421
00:24:13,825 --> 00:24:15,226
That was quite upsetting.

422
00:24:15,865 --> 00:24:17,395
You didn't have to react like that.

423
00:24:17,766 --> 00:24:20,036
What's so upsetting? We're just guys.

424
00:24:20,605 --> 00:24:21,635
What?

425
00:24:22,405 --> 00:24:25,335
Well, as bros.

426
00:24:26,575 --> 00:24:28,145
Bros?

427
00:24:29,615 --> 00:24:31,645
No. Best friends.

428
00:24:32,845 --> 00:24:33,845
Gosh.

429
00:24:34,315 --> 00:24:36,654
Why do I really want to take the subway?

430
00:24:36,655 --> 00:24:38,585
- I'll get going. - Just a moment.

431
00:24:43,795 --> 00:24:45,226
I visited you at the hospital every single day.

432
00:24:46,766 --> 00:24:49,865
It was really hard on me before you woke up...

433
00:24:51,635 --> 00:24:52,936
and even after you woke up.

434
00:24:54,835 --> 00:24:57,006
Even that petty So Eun Ho is acting like your guardian.

435
00:24:57,776 --> 00:25:00,176
Why can't I even do that?

436
00:25:29,436 --> 00:25:30,635
Is it that person?

437
00:25:33,875 --> 00:25:35,006
The one that gives you a hard time.

438
00:25:36,575 --> 00:25:37,676
Mind your own business.

439
00:25:47,155 --> 00:25:48,456
Are things serious between you and So Eun Ho?

440
00:25:51,496 --> 00:25:53,226
- Well... - I liked you...

441
00:25:55,496 --> 00:25:56,936
even more than him.

442
00:25:58,595 --> 00:25:59,605
What?

443
00:26:03,936 --> 00:26:05,006
Don't leave.
