Oh, come on.

21
00:01:32,472 --> 00:01:35,010
I just need to send this to the marketing team.

22
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,272

Hello.

52
00:04:13,662 --> 00:04:15,831
You really must not have anyone with talent.

53
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:17,671
You're giving a 3-year employee an opportunity.

54
00:04:17,672 --> 00:04:18,771
And it's a girl too.

55
00:04:22,072 --> 00:04:24,011
You must be a terrible judge of character.

56
00:04:24,471 --> 00:04:26,882
You're rating people by their work experience and gender.

57
00:04:27,482 --> 00:04:29,411
I think you're the terrible judge of character.

58

62

Gosh. Mr. Han has a great taste.

Is that Min Hee Jung's kid?

65
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,331
- Hello? - Yes?

66
00:05:19,701 --> 00:05:21,831
Why don't you start your presentation without stalling?

67
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:25,700
Oh, right.

68
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:26,771
But...

69
00:05:27,172 --> 00:05:28,841
don't you have any presentation material?

70
00:05:44,091 --> 00:05:45,261
I have not prepared...

71
00:05:47,362 --> 00:05:48,961

72

I would feel grateful...

73
00:05:52,002 --> 00:05:54,101
if you could focus on me during the presentation.

74
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:57,001
The presentation material will be sent...

75
00:05:57,002 --> 00:05:59,672
to each team after the presentation.

76
00:06:00,201 --> 00:06:01,242
Then...

77
00:06:01,771 --> 00:06:05,641
I will begin the presentation on the branding of...

78
00:06:06,511 --> 00:06:07,612

79
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,021

88
00:06:32,672 --> 00:06:36,841

93

No.

100
00:07:26,422 --> 00:07:29,131
You must be prepared up to all that...

101
00:07:29,132 --> 00:07:30,492
for me to give you a pass.

102
00:07:30,862 --> 00:07:33,062
If not, what's the point? Aren't I right?

103
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:37,302
I'll give you a week.

104

113
00:08:29,252 --> 00:08:30,422
Stop right there!

114
00:08:43,932 --> 00:08:46,100
I'm really here for something.

115
00:08:46,101 --> 00:08:47,871

118
00:08:55,381 --> 00:08:56,451
Great work.

119
00:08:56,782 --> 00:08:58,951
Although it wasn't what you prepared.

120
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,951
Why? Did something happen?

121
00:09:01,322 --> 00:09:03,022
- Was it obvious? - Very obvious.

122
00:09:04,322 --> 00:09:05,961
There was an accident on the first floor.

123
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:08,262
It wasn't bad even with that in mind.

124
00:09:08,522 --> 00:09:11,032
But there's something that has to be solved.

125
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:13,902
I must get it solved...

126
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,802

00:09:38,591 --> 00:09:39,621
Awesome.

134
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,892
Won't that make her the youngest manager?

00:13:57,111 --> 00:13:58,381
Yes, it is.

190
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:01,052
A very desperate one.

191
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,361
We want to give you more time,

192
00:14:10,062 --> 00:14:12,461
but we will give you two days.

193
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:17,802
I'm very desperate too.

194
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:20,142
She's coming.

195
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:25,542
Hey, he was old enough...

196
00:14:26,012 --> 00:14:28,312
to be your grandpa. Wasn't that a bit too much?

197
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:30,851
He might have lost even the smallest desire to work with us.

198
00:14:31,581 --> 00:14:32,581
No.

199
00:14:33,682 --> 00:14:35,381
It might have sparked a new desire that wasn't there.

200
00:14:35,951 --> 00:14:36,951
What?

201
00:14:37,652 --> 00:14:40,192
I must have what my opponent needs...

202
00:14:42,022 --> 00:14:44,032
to earn what I want.

203
00:14:47,601 --> 00:14:48,601
Hey.

204
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:50,072
Na Eon.

205
00:15:02,412 --> 00:15:03,552
So...

206
00:15:04,512 --> 00:15:06,652
this is where that master lives.

(Intangible Cultural Asset's Home, Cosmetics Farm, Ji Hyung Joon)

208
00:15:13,322 --> 00:15:14,422
Is anyone there?

209
00:15:14,591 --> 00:15:15,892
Oh, gosh.

210
00:15:16,491 --> 00:15:19,062
What's wrong with you?

211
00:15:19,262 --> 00:15:20,302
What's wrong?

212
00:15:29,572 --> 00:15:32,210
Segye Group's newly released Charmant...

213
00:15:32,211 --> 00:15:33,642
is becoming the talk of town.

214
00:15:34,042 --> 00:15:35,781
Charmant's signature scent...

215
00:15:35,782 --> 00:15:37,980
consists of Master Ji Hyung Joon's touch...

216
00:15:37,981 --> 00:15:40,250
who has succeeded the scent creation method of the Joseon Dynasty,

217
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:41,652
giving that much more meaning to it.

218
00:15:42,322 --> 00:15:45,620
Candle Charmant has been highly praised in a foreign exhibition.

219
00:15:45,621 --> 00:15:49,591
They are pushing forward for an entrance into the global market.

220
00:15:50,292 --> 00:15:52,701
This is a real masterpiece!

221
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:54,731
I agree.

222
00:15:55,461 --> 00:15:58,401
But isn't it a bit risky...

223
00:15:58,402 --> 00:15:59,700
to lean on just one master?

224
00:15:59,701 --> 00:16:00,841
During the launch,

225
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:03,772
we will start a project to discover...

226
00:16:04,111 --> 00:16:05,672
lost masters of scent.

227
00:16:05,741 --> 00:16:08,182
Each of their scents...

228
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:10,751
will become a signature scent of its own.

229
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:12,381
Right.

230
00:16:13,381 --> 00:16:15,181
From time to time,

231
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,152
Mr. Han seems so negative.

232
00:16:17,792 --> 00:16:19,262
Even the top hotels...

233
00:16:19,621 --> 00:16:21,892
are wanting to use our candles.

234
00:16:22,461 --> 00:16:23,662
I'm sorry.

235
00:16:23,861 --> 00:16:24,932

236
00:16:25,562 --> 00:16:27,731

How can you be like this to me?

250
00:17:12,542 --> 00:17:14,110
Why would you ask us that?

251
00:17:14,111 --> 00:17:16,482
So let me meet Kang Na Eon!

252
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,111

Bandi Candle. You know about it, don't you?

262
00:18:16,911 --> 00:18:18,111
It's my first time hearing about it.

263
00:18:18,611 --> 00:18:19,880
How can you not know?

264
00:18:19,881 --> 00:18:22,042
You stole our candle's concept.

265
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:23,851
Do you have evidence?

266
00:18:24,282 --> 00:18:25,312
What?

267
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:26,522
I'll give you a week.

268
00:18:27,482 --> 00:18:29,551
If you make sure to find evidence within a week,

269
00:18:29,552 --> 00:18:30,722
I'll accept it.

I was treated just like...

287
00:20:57,901 --> 00:20:59,302
After the Bandi Candle incident,

288
00:20:59,941 --> 00:21:02,502
Segye Group's marketing team broke up, right?

289
00:21:02,812 --> 00:21:05,340
I thought you would lose a lot through that.

290
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:07,081
But you went back up in an instant.

291
00:21:09,282 --> 00:21:11,512
Being so desperate to climb back up,

292
00:21:12,252 --> 00:21:14,421
I wanted to know what mindset you had while living life.

293
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:16,992
I was curious if you even felt an ounce of guilt.

294
00:21:18,292 --> 00:21:19,351
But...

295
00:21:21,492 --> 00:21:23,361
you didn't even remember me.

296
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,931
Just as if nothing happened.

297
00:21:26,762 --> 00:21:28,401
That was why I came this far.

298
00:21:29,161 --> 00:21:30,371
To bring back your memory.

299
00:21:30,671 --> 00:21:31,732
So?

300
00:21:33,202 --> 00:21:35,271
Are you trying to ruin my life with my body?

301
00:21:35,272 --> 00:21:36,341
Yes.

302
00:21:37,072 --> 00:21:38,072
You dare to?

303
00:21:38,073 --> 00:21:39,881
Yes, I dare to.

304
00:21:42,141 --> 00:21:45,151
Why don't you just say you got our bodies switched too?

305
00:21:46,952 --> 00:21:48,121
Perhaps?

306
00:21:48,752 --> 00:21:49,792
What?

307
00:21:50,421 --> 00:21:52,052
I've prayed every night...

308
00:21:52,621 --> 00:21:55,091
to become Kang Na Eon and bring her down.

309
00:22:00,101 --> 00:22:01,601
I prayed to become Kang Na Eon...

310
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:06,742
and reveal all of the things you have done.

311
00:22:08,901 --> 00:22:10,941
I prayed every single night for you to suffer a hundredfold...

312
00:22:11,441 --> 00:22:12,512
No.

313
00:22:13,181 --> 00:22:15,081
A thousandfold...

314
00:22:16,911 --> 00:22:19,381
after becoming me.

315
00:22:22,452 --> 00:22:24,091
I guess my desperate prayers...

316
00:22:25,191 --> 00:22:27,022
were answered.

317
00:22:29,121 --> 00:22:31,031
What nonsense.

318
00:22:31,032 --> 00:22:33,661
And stealing someone's years of hard work...

319
00:22:34,661 --> 00:22:35,762
makes sense?

320
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:37,901
Turn things back.

321
00:22:39,331 --> 00:22:42,341
Put everything back in its place.

322
00:22:42,772 --> 00:22:43,941
Don't ask me.

323
00:22:45,512 --> 00:22:46,712
I don't know how.

327
00:22:57,351 --> 00:22:59,151
seems hopeless for that.

You punk.

What's wrong with you? Gosh.

330
00:23:07,861 --> 00:23:09,601
Isn't the only method we know...

331
00:23:10,532 --> 00:23:11,901
to turn back?

332
00:23:14,772 --> 00:23:15,972
That's enough.
