What's wrong with you? Gosh.

00:00:10,822 --> 00:00:12,521
Isn't the only method we know...

7
00:00:13,521 --> 00:00:14,721
to turn back?

8
00:00:17,692 --> 00:00:18,931
That's enough.

9
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:20,631
You're the worst.

10
00:00:25,701 --> 00:00:26,742
Darn it.

11
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:33,912

17
00:01:25,931 --> 00:01:28,371
If what So Eun Ho wants from Director Han...

18
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:32,442
is evidence about the incident from five years ago...

19
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:38,582
Director Han.

20
00:01:40,011 --> 00:01:41,751
You're talking like you have something...

21
00:01:41,752 --> 00:01:43,751
you can kill me with.

22
00:01:43,752 --> 00:01:45,451
I already had it...

23
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:47,722
five years ago.

24
00:01:49,352 --> 00:01:51,322

- Hello, Director Han. - Hello, Director Han.

30
00:02:07,942 --> 00:02:08,972
Good morning.

31
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:12,312
Hey, Manager So. You came in early.

32
00:02:13,312 --> 00:02:14,842
How does it feel to become a manager?

33
00:02:16,211 --> 00:02:17,352
Doesn't it feel thrilling?

34
00:02:18,622 --> 00:02:19,882
I heard about it yesterday.

35
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:24,391
I wanted to trample on Kang Na Eon in front of everyone.

36
00:02:24,491 --> 00:02:27,361
Competing through presentations? It wasn't a bad idea.

37
00:02:27,921 --> 00:02:30,161
Make her become a loser...

38
00:02:30,162 --> 00:02:32,361
in front of everyone.

39
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:41,041
Why do you hate Kang Na Eon so much?

40
00:02:42,372 --> 00:02:44,241
Must there be a reason to hate someone?

41
00:02:46,682 --> 00:02:48,241
If I deal with Kang Na Eon,

42
00:02:49,812 --> 00:02:51,451
will I get what I want?

43
00:02:51,652 --> 00:02:52,822
Do you have trust issues?

44
00:02:53,852 --> 00:02:55,752
You already saw the evidence.

45
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:08,502
You won't have any teammates around for the time being.

46
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:10,701
I'll provide you with the funds.

47
00:03:11,072 --> 00:03:13,342
Use an external company if you need to.

48
00:03:21,141 --> 00:03:23,481
Evidence of the incident from five years ago?

49
00:03:38,602 --> 00:03:40,932
I need your help.

50
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:43,771
So...

51
00:03:44,331 --> 00:03:47,472
you want help for Segye Group's marketing team work?

52
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:49,472
Yes.

53
00:03:50,511 --> 00:03:51,611
I don't have any teammates.

54
00:03:52,081 --> 00:03:55,550
Well, we have our own teams...

55
00:03:55,551 --> 00:03:56,611
and tasks.

56
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:59,721
Even though we may be colleagues, that sounds a bit...

57
00:03:59,722 --> 00:04:02,691
Su Dong, you don't have any projects given from your team...

58
00:04:02,692 --> 00:04:03,751
and will be free.

59
00:04:03,752 --> 00:04:07,460
Come on, Eun Ho. I'll still have work to do.

60
00:04:07,461 --> 00:04:09,631
You did what Manager Kang asked you to do.

61
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:11,701
It also isn't your first time in Segye Group.

62
00:04:12,662 --> 00:04:13,701
What are you saying?

63
00:04:14,232 --> 00:04:17,101
Hey, it wasn't your first time here?

64
00:04:17,271 --> 00:04:18,372
It's the same for you, Ul Soop.

65
00:04:18,502 --> 00:04:21,072
I'll ask Cha Jung Woo, so don't worry about it.

66
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:22,442
Cha Jung Woo?

67
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:24,242
Eun Ho!

68
00:04:24,672 --> 00:04:26,841
Are you going to face our manager now?

69
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:28,211
Hey!

70
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:29,611
Hey!

71
00:04:29,612 --> 00:04:31,281
- Stop. - This isn't it.

72
00:04:31,581 --> 00:04:33,651
Hi, Jung Woo. It's me.

73
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:35,591
So Eun Ho?

74
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:37,021
What are you?

75
00:04:38,492 --> 00:04:39,921
After getting into Segye Group, you're causing Na Eon...

76
00:04:39,922 --> 00:04:41,891
I'll be working with Seo Ul Soop.

77
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:45,701
Eun Ho!

78
00:04:46,461 --> 00:04:49,002
Has something happened to your head?

79
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:06,752
Director Han.

80
00:05:07,752 --> 00:05:09,391
Until I get the evidence,

81
00:05:10,091 --> 00:05:11,622
I must help you.

82
00:05:20,461 --> 00:05:23,072
- Gosh. Hello. - Gosh. This is so heavy.

83
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:25,571
- My gosh. - It's huge.

84
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:26,970
What brings you here?

85
00:05:26,971 --> 00:05:29,111
You caused a fuss at HQ Motors...

86
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:31,241
wanting to do it all on your own.

87
00:05:31,242 --> 00:05:32,981
But can you handle this all on your own?

88
00:05:32,982 --> 00:05:34,010
That is why...

89
00:05:34,011 --> 00:05:35,411
- we are here to help. - We are here to help.

90
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:37,780
Let's use the same office while we're at it.

91
00:05:37,781 --> 00:05:39,850
The personal office is much better...

92
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:42,150
than the one for Underdog.

93
00:05:42,151 --> 00:05:43,192
I...

94
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:46,361
plan to deal with this project carelessly.

95
00:05:46,362 --> 00:05:49,132
All right. First of all,

96
00:05:50,091 --> 00:05:52,760
I will look through some papers for some marketing points.

97
00:05:52,761 --> 00:05:55,100
Goodness. Then I'll start with a draft for the marketing design.

98
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:56,301
I might have to stay up all night.

99
00:05:56,302 --> 00:05:57,872
Then...

100
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:01,971
does that leave me out?

101
00:06:02,572 --> 00:06:03,612
Jenny.

102
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,881
You can go through social media...

103
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:08,552
to look up different cases based on...

104
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,011
new technology marketing.

105
00:06:10,351 --> 00:06:12,521
That's my expertise!

106
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:16,091
See? Don't you feel so reassured with us around?

107
00:06:19,322 --> 00:06:21,661
I'm just letting you stay because you won't seem to get kicked out.

108
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:23,991
You're Kang Na Eon, indeed.

109
00:06:23,992 --> 00:06:26,302
Look at you with your rude words.

110
00:06:27,062 --> 00:06:29,632
Eun Ho would be the perfect one to have around right now.

111
00:06:30,302 --> 00:06:31,331
Exactly.

112
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:32,802
You don't know, don't you?

113
00:06:33,072 --> 00:06:35,311
Manager So isn't just a nice guy.

114
00:06:35,312 --> 00:06:36,840
He is a talented worker.

115
00:06:36,841 --> 00:06:39,111
He's so warm-hearted too.

116
00:06:39,112 --> 00:06:41,641
Right. Remember how he handled Daesungjag?

117
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:44,612
"We won't change anything."

118
00:06:45,422 --> 00:06:47,780
That was why the grandma and granddaughter...

119
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:49,751
almost bawled their eyes out.

120
00:06:49,752 --> 00:06:51,520
But what's the point now?

121
00:06:51,521 --> 00:06:53,691
He's in the marketing team of Segye Group.

122
00:06:53,692 --> 00:06:54,891
Right.

123
00:06:55,562 --> 00:06:58,391
So Eun Ho is our enemy right now.

124
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:01,502
Right now, we're on Seongsu Agency's...

125
00:07:01,562 --> 00:07:03,331
Manager Kang's side!

126
00:07:04,002 --> 00:07:05,400
- Okay. That... - Was...

127
00:07:05,401 --> 00:07:06,601
Great.

128
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:08,141
For now,

129
00:07:09,742 --> 00:07:11,042
let's work on the presentation.

130
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,221
Hello?

131
00:07:23,451 --> 00:07:26,292
Manager Nam? I need to see you.

132
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:28,091
I'm busy right now.

133
00:07:28,632 --> 00:07:31,731
I think I have discovered a great secret...

134
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:34,362
between Kang Na Eon and So Eun Ho.

135
00:07:38,432 --> 00:07:41,201
What is that secret between So Eun Ho and Kang Na Eon?

136
00:07:50,682 --> 00:07:52,451
Kang Na Eon and So Eun Ho.

137
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:56,021
I think they went through a spirit change.

138
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:05,801
A spirit change?

139
00:08:05,802 --> 00:08:08,002
Haven't you been watching too many shows?

140
00:08:08,132 --> 00:08:10,072
What nonsense are you saying?

141
00:08:13,271 --> 00:08:15,771
I know it sounds stupid.

142
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:18,742
That is why I called you here.

143
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:24,951
Find out...

144
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:27,482
if they really went through a spirit change.

145
00:08:32,422 --> 00:08:33,822
How can I do that?

146
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:38,131
Let's say they really did go through a spirit change.

147
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:39,861
What difference does that make?

148
00:08:40,201 --> 00:08:41,201
If...

149
00:08:41,331 --> 00:08:43,931
they really have gone through a spirit change,

150
00:08:43,932 --> 00:08:45,771
the Kang Na Eon we see is not Kang Na Eon.

151
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:47,970
It's just the newbie So Eun Ho who has no power.

152
00:08:47,971 --> 00:08:49,071
With just a bit of trouble,

153
00:08:49,072 --> 00:08:50,971
we can bring Kang Na Eon down right away.

154
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:53,782
Right.

155
00:09:00,751 --> 00:09:03,291
It would be great to focus on this part.

156
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:06,662
The liquid hydrogen battery was developed for the first time...

157
00:09:07,062 --> 00:09:08,192
by HQ Motors.

158
00:09:09,562 --> 00:09:11,231
So that's So Eun Ho?

159
00:09:15,262 --> 00:09:17,130
So with that...

160
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:18,471
Hey!

161
00:09:21,701 --> 00:09:24,470
Well, the weather is great and all. We can't be working all the time.

162
00:09:24,471 --> 00:09:26,841
Why don't we go for a workshop soon?

163
00:09:27,812 --> 00:09:29,312
It was great last year, wasn't it?

164
00:09:30,412 --> 00:09:31,652
Fine.

165
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:33,751
Okay.

166
00:09:34,981 --> 00:09:36,022
Then I'll get things planned.

167
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:37,422
I'll find a date.

168
00:09:38,522 --> 00:09:39,991
- Good luck. - Bye.

169
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:42,662
Let's get focused again.

170
00:09:44,991 --> 00:09:46,401
Kang Na Eon at a workshop?

171
00:09:46,402 --> 00:09:48,062
She was the only one to miss it.

172
00:09:48,101 --> 00:09:49,432
She can't remember that?

173
00:09:51,201 --> 00:09:52,201
Is it really So Eun Ho?

174
00:09:56,172 --> 00:09:59,511
Even if it's the first liquid hydrogen battery in Korea,

175
00:09:59,512 --> 00:10:02,611
all marketing ideas for cars feel the same.

176
00:10:03,282 --> 00:10:04,412
Right.

177
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,682
Whether it be a new battery or a new car,

178
00:10:08,182 --> 00:10:11,750
lining up a handsome actor up front would do the job.

179
00:10:11,751 --> 00:10:13,792
- Right. - But...

180
00:10:13,892 --> 00:10:15,432
I think I've found something.

181
00:10:16,692 --> 00:10:18,161
It's a small company,

182
00:10:18,162 --> 00:10:20,961
but I think we can use it as reference.

183
00:10:21,902 --> 00:10:24,771
Park Jenny does it again.

184
00:10:24,772 --> 00:10:25,971
This could give us some ideas.

185
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:28,942
But...

186
00:10:29,241 --> 00:10:32,682
this looks very similar to the technology...

187
00:10:33,081 --> 00:10:35,981
of HQ Motor's first liquid hydrogen battery in Korea.

188
00:10:36,182 --> 00:10:37,381
Right.

189
00:10:37,751 --> 00:10:39,850
Didn't HQ Motors say they were the first ones...

190
00:10:39,851 --> 00:10:41,580
to come up with rechargeable liquid hydrogen batteries?

191
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:42,990
That's so weird.

192
00:10:42,991 --> 00:10:46,421
If HQ Motors is causing a fuss about it,

193
00:10:46,422 --> 00:10:47,891
shouldn't that company already have been successful?

194
00:10:47,892 --> 00:10:50,032
Right. It must've become a massive company.

195
00:10:51,432 --> 00:10:52,432
Let's go to this company.

196
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:55,471
Right now?

197
00:10:58,001 --> 00:10:59,701
I feel like a ghost will appear.

198
00:11:00,371 --> 00:11:02,772
- There must be ghosts here. - Right.

199
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,110
This place must have gone down.

200
00:11:04,111 --> 00:11:05,111
Shall we run?

201
00:11:05,512 --> 00:11:06,782
Let's try going in for now.

202
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:08,912
- Let's go. - Right. Let's go.

203
00:11:09,081 --> 00:11:10,981
- Go first. - You go first.

204
00:11:11,152 --> 00:11:12,381
Hurry.

205
00:11:16,652 --> 00:11:18,091
What's with this old car?

206
00:11:20,591 --> 00:11:22,831
Hurry up, Lex.

207
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:25,130
I'm scared too.

208
00:11:25,131 --> 00:11:27,032
Over there.

209
00:11:27,162 --> 00:11:28,162
There.

210
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:36,211
Are you employees of High Jet?

211
00:11:39,042 --> 00:11:40,512
Isn't that Eun Ho?

212
00:12:00,201 --> 00:12:01,761
He looks so sexy.

213
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:04,201
He looks even sexier after going into Segye Group.

214
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,971
But if Eun Ho is here,

215
00:12:08,142 --> 00:12:10,672
isn't HQ Motors really involved with this place?

216
00:12:11,072 --> 00:12:12,142
Let's go.

217
00:12:17,912 --> 00:12:19,121
(CEO's Room)

218
00:12:29,731 --> 00:12:30,991
CEO Choi Chang Joo?

219
00:12:31,392 --> 00:12:32,730
Hello.

220
00:12:32,731 --> 00:12:35,130
We're from the marketing team of Seongsu Agency...

221
00:12:35,131 --> 00:12:37,271
The quantity of heat of hydrogen is three times more...

222
00:12:37,272 --> 00:12:39,271
than the same weight of an internal combustion engine.

223
00:12:39,272 --> 00:12:42,172
For the average car of a family,

224
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:45,542
around 100km of fuel efficiency can be produced per 1kW of hydrogen.

225
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:49,182
A gas tank of 6 to 7kg will be enough.

226
00:12:49,211 --> 00:12:51,511
The criticism that a car with a hydrogen tank is more dangerous...

227
00:12:51,512 --> 00:12:55,322
than a car with a natural gas tank is incorrect.

228
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:58,220
The technology of the storage of hydrogen...

229
00:12:58,221 --> 00:12:59,621
is a technology that is over 100 years!

230
00:13:01,922 --> 00:13:03,692
HQ Motors is right.

231
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:07,001
Liquid hydrogen is more stable than gaseous hydrogen.

232
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:10,001
If people use liquid hydrogen more,

233
00:13:10,432 --> 00:13:12,542
the hydrogen market will become bigger.

234
00:13:12,902 --> 00:13:14,370
That's why I love big companies.

235
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:16,241
I don't like the small High Jet.

236
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:19,611
Who said such a thing?

237
00:13:19,912 --> 00:13:21,542
The handsome guy said that.

238
00:13:22,312 --> 00:13:23,381
Handsome guy?

239
00:13:24,282 --> 00:13:25,351
So Eun Ho?

240
00:13:25,412 --> 00:13:26,951
In a car this big,

241
00:13:27,621 --> 00:13:29,552
if you have just a hydrogen battery just this big,

242
00:13:30,192 --> 00:13:31,491
it can move 100km.

243
00:13:32,022 --> 00:13:33,822
That's how great hydrogen batteries are!

244
00:13:34,221 --> 00:13:35,562
If you stay still,

245
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:38,731
we will...

246
00:13:40,501 --> 00:13:41,802
take care of everything for you.

247
00:13:42,902 --> 00:13:45,601
He said he'd take care of everything if I stayed still.

248
00:14:22,042 --> 00:14:25,412
Kang Na Eon, even until the end, you're...

249
00:14:32,782 --> 00:14:37,221
This is the group chat for the TF Team for HQ Motors.

250
00:14:38,292 --> 00:14:39,860
But what are we going to do?

251
00:14:39,861 --> 00:14:41,061
(What are we going to do?)

252
00:14:41,062 --> 00:14:43,590
- Gosh. - This seems like a snatch...

253
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,991
of a small business's technology.

254
00:14:45,861 --> 00:14:47,501
It shouldn't be our business,

255
00:14:47,731 --> 00:14:50,272
but we can't really keep our eyes shut against this.

256
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:53,841
How about we just step away from this case?

257
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,412
I won't let the same thing from five years ago happen again.

258
00:15:03,512 --> 00:15:04,611
I'll stop this.

259
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,682
- What? - What?

260
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,450
At a presentation for HQ Motors,

261
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:13,392
you're going to do a presentation about High Jet?

262
00:15:13,822 --> 00:15:14,892
Yes.

263
00:15:15,162 --> 00:15:17,360
I have let everyone know the real owner of the technology.

264
00:15:17,361 --> 00:15:21,131
Is there a point of doing that at HQ Motors?

265
00:15:21,432 --> 00:15:23,572
I might as well just give up on the presentation.

266
00:15:23,601 --> 00:15:25,172
That's what I want to say.

267
00:15:25,501 --> 00:15:28,542
We'll end up in big trouble at this rate.

268
00:15:28,672 --> 00:15:31,412
There will be a lot in HQ Motors that don't know about this.

269
00:15:31,942 --> 00:15:33,512
They might want to change after finding out.

270
00:15:34,111 --> 00:15:36,750
I don't know what Eun Ho said to him,

271
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:39,450
but even the CEO of High Jet claims it wasn't a snatch.

272
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:40,750
Will our words mean anything?

273
00:15:40,751 --> 00:15:43,292
The important thing is the truth.

274
00:15:44,751 --> 00:15:47,491
We can't keep our eyes shut on something that isn't right.

275
00:15:48,392 --> 00:15:50,361
You don't have to force yourselves.

276
00:15:50,692 --> 00:15:52,091
I am willing to do this on my own.

277
00:15:54,402 --> 00:15:55,532
Gosh.

278
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:05,172
Will doing the High Jet presentation be a good idea?

279
00:16:05,942 --> 00:16:07,341
Of course not.

280
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,311
I don't know! My head hurts!

281
00:16:09,312 --> 00:16:11,581
But why has she become all righteous all of a sudden?

282
00:16:12,312 --> 00:16:15,152
What is Eun Ho up to right now?

283
00:16:16,091 --> 00:16:20,561
Eun Ho met the CEO of High Jet too.

284
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:23,091
He said he would take care of everything.

285
00:16:23,292 --> 00:16:25,631
He must have a plan of his own.

286
00:16:26,302 --> 00:16:28,101
Why don't we go and find out?

287
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:44,380
I told you. I said there wouldn't be anyone during lunchtime.

288
00:16:44,381 --> 00:16:46,522
- You're the best, sis. - Let's go.

289
00:16:53,192 --> 00:16:54,192
They left.

290
00:16:55,192 --> 00:16:56,432

291
00:16:56,662 --> 00:16:57,831
Let's go.

292
00:17:04,302 --> 00:17:06,041
My honey, Eun Ho.

293
00:17:06,042 --> 00:17:08,072
He's working all on his own without any teammates.

294
00:17:08,302 --> 00:17:09,312
I feel sad.

295
00:17:09,472 --> 00:17:10,641
Are you serious?

296
00:17:10,712 --> 00:17:12,811
Was Eun Ho this clean?

297
00:17:12,812 --> 00:17:13,841
- Go for it. - Here.

298
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:18,282
- HQ Motors. - It's here.

299
00:17:20,851 --> 00:17:22,321
It's taking a while.

300
00:17:22,322 --> 00:17:23,351
- Gosh! - He's here!

301
00:17:25,522 --> 00:17:26,522
- Hurry! - Hurry!

302
00:17:33,661 --> 00:17:34,831

(HQ Motors, the only company that can supply liquid hydrogen)

305
00:18:01,661 --> 00:18:03,661
He knows they took the technology from High Jet.

306
00:18:03,861 --> 00:18:05,292
He's just going with it.

307
00:18:05,591 --> 00:18:07,160
I didn't see him like that.

308
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:08,901
He's such a bad guy.

309
00:18:09,331 --> 00:18:10,601
There's no doubt about that.

310
00:18:11,302 --> 00:18:13,001
But what can we do?

311
00:18:13,002 --> 00:18:14,502
There's nothing we can do about it.

312
00:18:15,871 --> 00:18:19,171
Thank you for helping me out.

313
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:20,982
But I'll work on my own now.

314
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,812
- All of a sudden? - Yes.

315
00:18:26,052 --> 00:18:29,252
There will be a big fuss to reveal the truth.

316
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:33,621
You will have fingers pointed against you and be called a liar.

317
00:18:35,091 --> 00:18:36,091

- We're in the same team! - We're in the same team!

367
00:25:12,222 --> 00:25:13,292
Okay.

368
00:25:13,462 --> 00:25:17,492
Then let's go and get CEO Choi Chang Joo together.

369
00:25:18,661 --> 00:25:19,802
- Yes! - Let's go.

370
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:27,471
So Eun Ho. He'll do a good job, right?

371
00:25:27,472 --> 00:25:29,041
If things go wrong, both of us...

372
00:25:29,042 --> 00:25:30,572
Don't worry too much.

373
00:25:31,712 --> 00:25:34,812
There isn't anyone else as desperate as him against Kang Na Eon.

374
00:25:35,441 --> 00:25:36,482
Besides,

375
00:25:37,151 --> 00:25:39,111
HQ Motors must have taken care of things well too.

376
00:25:45,492 --> 00:25:47,022
Did you leave any evidence behind?

377
00:25:49,222 --> 00:25:51,391
Gosh, of course not.

378
00:25:52,462 --> 00:25:53,702
Nowhere in the world...

379
00:25:53,931 --> 00:25:57,830
is there evidence that High Jet developed liquid hydrogen batteries.

380
00:25:57,831 --> 00:26:00,072
All of them have been collected and destroyed.

381
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:15,321
- Isn't that Eun Ho? - Eun Ho?

382
00:26:15,322 --> 00:26:17,190
Isn't CEO Choi with him?

383
00:26:17,191 --> 00:26:19,822
He looks so handsome even with just a glance.

384
00:26:20,661 --> 00:26:22,062
I'll be there myself.

385
00:26:22,792 --> 00:26:24,691
I can't wait to see...

386
00:26:25,431 --> 00:26:26,762
what face Kang Na Eon will make.

387
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:29,871
I'll make sure to show you that face you want to see.

388
00:26:34,671 --> 00:26:37,272
But where are we going?

389
00:26:37,671 --> 00:26:39,042
It won't take long.

390
00:26:58,292 --> 00:27:00,160
(Branding in Seongsu)

391
00:27:00,161 --> 00:27:03,930
