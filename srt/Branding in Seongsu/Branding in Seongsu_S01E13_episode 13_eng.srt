1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,060
   

2
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,600
 Don't go. 

3
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:29,750


4
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,530
Hey.

5
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:36,970
W-What are you doing?

6
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,290
Who is...

7
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,180
that person?

8
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,460
Take care of Kang Na Eon first.

9
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,730
If you can't,

10
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,850
I won't let you be either.

11
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:18,040
Is this bastard's face the problem?

12
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,420
   

13
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,260
   

14
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,010
   

15
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:29,350
   

16
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,670
   

17
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:48,850
   

18
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,110
Hey, hey, that's... Hey, hey, hey.

19
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,490
Gosh, it's okay. We're friends. We can share drinks.

20
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,250
Hey, I told you not to drink that.

21
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,440
Hey! Because you scared me...

22
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,910
You can't do that to your friend, bastard.

23
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,380
- Well, it's because— 
 - I'm leaving.

24
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,050
Hey.

25
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:29,820
Hey, Na Eon! Kang Na Eon!

26
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:34,760
She's allergic to peaches.

27
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,030
Is she okay?

28
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,230
Is he still not home?

29
00:02:49,230 --> 00:02:51,430
With my hot body?

30
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,810
W-What's this?

31
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:06,200
 Sunbae. 

32
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,620
 I don't care what you do with Yu Mi Sunbae, 

33
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:11,350
 but do something about this. 

34
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,520
 It's so itchy. It's killing me. 

35
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,420
   

36
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,920
 Eun Ho is dying! 

37
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,070
- Gosh, seriously. 
  - So itchy. 

38
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,920
 The third drawer of the desk in the study. 

39
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:51,250
You're blatantly spending the night out now?

40
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,370
   

41
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:56,210
I could be scary if I wanted to, too.

42
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:15,270
 Kang Na Eon's image... 

43
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:17,910
 I'll make sure to destroy it. 

44
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:22,620
 Hi. 

45
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,140
Are you still drunk? Your outfit is...

46
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:42,520
Your outfit and the makeup are pretty crude.

47
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,780
It feels so Y2K.

48
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,680
Don't be like that. I came determined today.

49
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,650
Stop joking around.

50
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,830
We aren't joking. We're serious.

51
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,910
We are.

52
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,760
 Just as I planned. 

53
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,290
Well, where's So Eun Ho?

54
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,200
The sexy monster came in early and then he left quickly.

55
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,960
Is he with Team 1?

56
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,720
By the way, you know I'm quite observant.

57
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:11,570
He wore the same outfit as yesterday.

58
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:14,290
He must have slept somewhere else. My gosh.

59
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,670
I could see Eun Ho doing that.

60
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:20,290
He's got the face and body. He can do that.

61
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:23,010
I won't forgive him.

62
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:25,870
Shit. Everyone,

63
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:29,370
bring him in front of me as soon as you see him, okay?

64
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,560
- Okay. 
 - Okay.

65
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,140
You've got to be kidding me.

66
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:39,610
The mighty So Eun Ho makes a mistake like this, too.

67
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,640
What's that?

68
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,000
My gosh, my gosh, my gosh.

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,400
Isn't this Nam Yun Hyeok? 
    

70
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,300
Did you put him in?

71
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,840
Who's this?

72
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,850
The sex symbol of our time.

73
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,620
A dangerous man.

74
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:55,960
You're the one who created that image for him.

75
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,300
He's just an ad model. What's so great about that?

76
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,050
Look at this thing. 
    

77
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,300
Who drinks strong liquor these days?

78
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,410
He didn't even do proper marketing research.

79
00:06:06,410 --> 00:06:09,680
Gosh, I love strong liquor.

80
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,320
It gets you drunk quickly

81
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,500
and lets you move on to the next level.

82
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,640
Gosh, you're so naughty, Princess.

83
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,380
If you drink with Nam Yun Hyeok,

84
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,480
I'd feel drunk immediately without drinking anything.

85
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,440
Just because of his gaze.

86
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,590
Gosh, Unni. You're naughtier than you look. You're too much!

87
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,870
That's right.

88
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:38,990
You don't necessarily have to get drunk.

89
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,080
Right. That's why Jenny joins us whenever we drink, although she doesn't drink much.

90
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,060
You could say people enjoy the drinking mood more.

91
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,830
It's more about the drinking vibe—

92
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:50,700
That's it! Jenny!

93
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,040
Gosh, I almost went deaf just now.

94
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,340
W-Where's Jenny right now? Did she not come to work?

95
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,230
- I don't know her. 
 - Geez, don't be like that.

96
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,960
Can I check her personal information?

97
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,370
Team Leader, it's quicker to do this with Jenny.

98
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,020
Goodbye, everyone.

99
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,400
 I'll escape from all the baggage and restraints of this world 

100
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,000
 and leave to find my happiness. 

101
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,280
 Bye, bye. 

102
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:22,500
Gosh, Jenny, come here! Jenny!

103
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,970
What's wrong with her?

104
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,800
I know.

105
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,040
Huh? J-Jenny!

106
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:34,090
Jenny! Jenny!

107
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,770
Jenny! Jenny!

108
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,100
Jenny! Jenny!

109
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,570
Are you okay, Jenny?

110
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,200
What are you doing right now?

111
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,530
Jenny! I know you're tired and hurt

112
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,010
but you can't give up on life so easily.

113
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:58,480
What? Why would I give up on my life?

114
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:02,110
On your social media you said, "Goodbye, everyone.

115
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,960
I'll leave to a new world."

116
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:07,690
What are you saying? I can't believe this.

117
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:10,790
   

118
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,990
Oh, right.

119
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:17,780
You didn't mean it like that?

120
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,030
You were scouted as an influencer?

121
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:36,380
 Hello. 

122
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:40,450
 We are Inbyeol Entertainment, a management company for influencers. 

123
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:43,470
 One million won per post... 
   

124
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,880
One million won?

125
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,620
We finished our discussion yesterday.

126
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,000
By chance, was that man last night—

127
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,020
Please process my resignation quickly.

128
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,530
Efficiently, quickly, cleanly.

129
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,650
Well, uh...

130
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,550
J-Jenny, we still haven't—

131
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:06,260
Bye.

132
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,990
Wait...

133
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,690
 Inbyeol Entertainment 

134
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,800
   

135
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,010
   

136
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:30,500
Come on. This is a total scam.

137
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,830
   

138
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:35,290
I'm not sure I should have gone as far as I did.

139
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:38,600
I made it too favorable to you, Jenny.

140
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:45,340
Can't you summarize it in three lines?

141
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:49,160
Oh, my God. Jenny...

142
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:53,920
we were thorough with it. Thorough.

143
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,120
I wrote it in English, so it's easy for you to read.

144
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,270
Gosh, why did you write it in English?

145
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,500
One million?

146
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:14,000
   

147
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,300
It sounds about right.

148
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,570
When should I start posting, then?

149
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:24,270
Starting now?

150
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,970
Is there something to do already?

151
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:30,490
Of course, there is.

152
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,160
Stand here and dance a bit.

153
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,760
What?

154
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,310
Make it...

155
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,820
sexy.

156
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,680
Shit, you piece of trash!

157
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:51,100
Let go! Let go of me!

158
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,560
Didn't you read the contract?

159
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,260
Article six, clause one.

160
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,460
"The signee pays up to

161
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:03,880
20 times more than the contract fee as a penalty when they breach the contract."

162
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,540
The contract fee was 10 million won. So it's 200 million won.

163
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:14,310
Just leave if you have a lot of money

164
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:19,640
and if you don't have money, do it. Dance.

165
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,450
 Let go of me! What are you doing? 

166
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,610
- You can't go in there. 
 - This is obviously a scam!

167
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,970
You can't do this here.

168
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,530
Why can't I do this here? Why can't I?

169
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,950
What? What's with all the noise?

170
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,330
How could you not recognize me, Kang Na Bong?

171
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:46,840
Gyaru. Gyaru, you're so cute.

172
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,460
I like pretty ones.

173
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,900
Do you want to play with me?

174
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,410
What's this? Is she crazy?

175
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:01,140
No, no, no, no!

176
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,930
I'm Kang Na Bong, a content creator with a million followers.

177
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:10,010
How could you not recognize Kang Na Bong if you do marketing on social media?

178
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,660
Kang Na Bong? I've never heard of you.

179
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,290
Look her up. Look her up.

180
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,250
Never mind!

181
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:23,400
Did you even know Jenny is represented by Ssaenbbak,

182
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,430
like me, when you tried to steal her?

183
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:29,070
Ssaenbbak? That Ssaenbbak?

184
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:31,320
Yes, that Ssaenbbak.

185
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:39,340
Should I tell my million subscribers all about how you

186
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:42,110
tried to scam her?

187
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,820
I'm sure there'd be a huge backlash.

188
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,760
No, no. I wasn't trying to do that.

189
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,410
Right? It's not like that, right?

190
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:55,440
Then I'll take my Jenny with me.

191
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,980
Of course, of course. Hey, escort them.

192
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,360
- Okay. 
 - You should escort them.

193
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,260
Let's go.

194
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,270
How did you find this place, Team Leader?

195
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:08,250
I couldn't find a team leader named Kang Na Bong on the Ssaembbak website.

196
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:10,960
Jenny, this is obviously a scam. How could you fall for it?

197
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,140
Let's walk out naturally.

198
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:16,120
What? Hey, Kang Na Bong!

199
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,540
What do we do now?

200
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,620
Act naturally. Act naturally.

201
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:21,710
Kang Na Bong.

202
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,440
What is it? Seriously.

203
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,090
Gyaru.

204
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:27,900
 Gyaru. 

205
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,370
I caught you.

206
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,460
Jenny, run when I say "one."

207
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:35,340
One!

208
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,770
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

209
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:40,950
Which way should we go?

210
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,420
This way. Hurry.

211
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:46,810
 Hurry up! Catch them! 

212
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,580
That way! That way!

213
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,670
That way! That way! That way!

214
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:54,990
My gosh!

215
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,310
- Watch where you're going. 
 - Hurry up!

216
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,520
 Catch Kang Na Bong! Kang Na Bong! 

217
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,030
Kang Na Bong!

218
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,690
Stop! Geez!

219
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,080
Stop right there!

220
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,930
Isn't that Kang Na Eon?

221
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:36,140
It doesn't look like you need to worry.

222
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,240
What's she doing?

223
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,590
Hey!

224
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,050
Stop chasing us!

225
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,980
Geez, Sir! Sir!

226
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,790
Hey! It's a red light!

227
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:55,980
Why do they keep chasing us?

228
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,840
 Catch them! Catch them! 

229
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:05,820
- That way? 
 - No, this way.

230
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,760
Help me. Help me.

231
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,630
- Let's go that way. 
 - Hold on!

232
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:19,780
Over there.

233
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:23,080
- Over there! 
  - Catch them. Catch them. 

234
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,920
Run!

235
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,120
Jenny.

236
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,170
Team Leader.

237
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,650
Gosh, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, it's the stairs. The stairs.

238
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,440
 Catch them! 

239
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,040
 Run! Run! 

240
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,910
What are you doing?

241
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,510
Don't touch me. Don't touch me!

242
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,390
- Let's go to the hospital. 
 - Okay!

243
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:25,310
Hospital!

244
00:16:25,830 --> 00:16:28,090
To the hospital!

245
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,510
You owe us, Jenny.

246
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,480
Be gentle!

247
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,250
 Gentle. 

248
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,480
 Okay, okay, okay. 

249
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,110
Hold each other's hand. Go ahead.

250
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:49,780
Don't be like that. Open your hands.

251
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,870
Hold hands. Hold hands. What are you, kids?

252
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:55,180
You're so childish. Seriously.

253
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,690
Since the school closed last year, we all panicked and ruined the college entrance exam.

254
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:07,200
 - Don't cry. You should take pretty pictures. 
 - Miss... 

255
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,910
 I'll miss you. 

256
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,200
You don't even know how I feel.

257
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:15,530
Did that happen?

258
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,540
I didn't know.

259
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:18,750
And aren't we all equal

260
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:21,940
if we work for the same company whether we're high school or college graduates?

261
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,540
Was I really supposed to put up with that?

262
00:17:24,540 --> 00:17:26,080
Of course not.

263
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,250
Chief Hwang Jae Ha? He's the jerk, obviously.

264
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,680
I'm sorry I lost my temper.

265
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,490
Okay, okay, okay.

266
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,150
Unni is apologizing, Jenny. Accept her apology.

267
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:47,240
And apologize to her for calling her a hag.

268
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,790
She is a hag.

269
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,620
Gosh, seriously.

270
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,460
- Jenny. 
 - But...

271
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:56,520
I take back what I said about you looking 30 years older.

272
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:59,100
That was a lie.

273
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:03,090
Jenny, stop acting silly. Be serious.

274
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,610
Really?

275
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:12,190
Gosh, you were lying when you said I looked 30 years older?

276
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,630
How many years do I look older?

277
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:16,190
Maybe, you look about two years older.

278
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:20,000
Gosh, you're exaggerating!

279
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,820
I've always known you were sweet.

280
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,340
Unni.

281
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:29,160
Hold on. You made up just like that?

282
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,350
Yeah, this is enough to resolve it. Why?

283
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,350
Never mind.

284
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:36,690
So, what are we doing now?

285
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:40,130
Jenny. Oh, Jenny!

286
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,020
You were singing like that earlier.

287
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,960
Me?

288
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,640
Why?

289
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,670
Because there's something only you can do.

290
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:54,580
- One, two, three. 
  - Fighting! 

291
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,200
- Let's do this! 
 - Okay.

292
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,140
All right.

293
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,460
♫  Just call me "Lady", not "someone's so-and-so"  ♫

294
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,610
♫  Don't call me ”Of Yours”  ♫

295
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,780
♫  I just may achieve my dream, get up   ♫

296
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,820
♫  I'm driven by pain, even in the face of challenge and despair  ♫

297
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,830
Okay.

298
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:24,380
Let's pull through together.

299
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:26,890
Open your eyes. Open them!

300
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,010
Just a little more, Jenny.

301
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,980
I'll do the clicking.

302
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,290
This isn't the mouse. Here's your mouse.

303
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,880
Okay, look. I want to accentuate this part.

304
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:41,410
♫  I'm already pretty high up  ♫

305
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,590
♫  Just call me my name  ♫

306
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:45,670
♫  I don't ask for much  ♫

307
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:47,800
♫  Don't tell me your rules  ♫

308
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,620
♫  I don't really care, over  ♫

309
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,980
We'll start over.

310
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,790
Please stand up the box.

311
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,390
 Hmph! The Underdog Team will win. 

312
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:10,000
 Now, it's war! 

313
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,550
♫  Just call me my name  ♫

314
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,910
♫  Don't tell me your rules  ♫

315
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:20,070
Wow, this is pretty good.

316
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,490
Your school is nice. Why is it closing? 
   

317
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:25,310
Wow, we're doing it here.

318
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,390
- Jenny. 
 - Miss.

319
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,090
 Thank you! 

320
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,530
Don't mention it.

321
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,360
It's all thanks to how hardworking Jenny was when she was in school.

322
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,170
- Whoa. 
 - She was? She was?

323
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,590
- Hi! 
 - Jenny.

324
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:41,710
Hi.

325
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,160
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

326
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,440
He's my best friend.

327
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,400
He'll do something amazing for us.

328
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:53,610
We'll use this as the main image.

329
00:20:53,610 --> 00:20:56,390
How about this one as the product photo?

330
00:20:56,390 --> 00:20:57,980
Do you have any other options?

331
00:20:57,980 --> 00:21:00,290
- Here they are. 
 - I think I like this one better.

332
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,710
Let's go with this, then.

333
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,460
N-Na Eon?

334
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,110
N-Na Eon...

335
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,550
Seriously.

336
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:44,540
Whiskey.

337
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,680
The mood.

338
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:54,180
The mood...

339
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,620
Get drunk by the mood...

340
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,730
♫  That brief moment  ♫

341
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,270
♫  My mouth was full, baby  ♫

342
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,150
♫  A feeling that lingered for too long  ♫

343
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:08,140
The keyword. Mood.

344
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,160
♫  Intense bitter, yet sweeter  ♫

345
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,620
Let's choose this as the key point.

346
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,270
Okay.

347
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,530
♫  I don't know what to do  ♫

348
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:25,240
♫  I just crinkle my nose, and I feel you for awhile  ♫

349
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,390
♫  If you know you, Bae  ♫

350
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:33,320
♫  How could I not love you?  ♫

351
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:34,950
   

352
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,040
 Hey, hey, that's... 

353
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,560
 Gosh, it's okay. We're friends. We can share drinks. 

354
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,400
 She's allergic to peaches. 

355
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,890
♫  Even if I cover my eyes, even if I try to shake it off  ♫

356
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:49,630
♫  It's you, I know  ♫

357
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:55,870
 The phone is powered off. You'll be connected to the voicemail after the beep. 

358
00:23:55,870 --> 00:24:00,180
♫  I'm drunk off you, Bae  ♫

359
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:29,910


360
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,650
Did you prepare a lot?

361
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,410
Yes, Ma'am. I mean...

362
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,240
Yeah.

363
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,110
We have the winning card.

364
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,850
Really?

365
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,780
We do, too.

366
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:50,160
The winning card.

367
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:59,740
- Wow. 
 - Daebak, he actually came.

368
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:01,500
Gosh, I'm a fan!

369
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,950
- Be quiet. 
 - I want a photo. A photo.

370
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:06,140
Wow. I'm recovering my eyesight. Don't stop me.

371
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,990
- Come to your senses. 
 - He's mine.

372
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,540
♫  I'll rock it in my style  ♫

373
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,370
♫  Fly freely  ♫

374
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:15,900
♫  Just go ahead and fire it up, break all the way  ♫

375
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,250
   

376
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,420
♫  I'm breaking rules  ♫

377
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,800
♫  I'm breaking rules  ♫

378
00:25:30,110 --> 00:25:35,530
♫  Don't stop and go faster and faster  ♫

379
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,310
♫  And I'm breaking rocks  ♫

380
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:41,090
♫  I'm breaking rocks  ♫

381
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,370
♫  I'm breaking laws  ♫

382
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:45,010
♫  Try surviving my punch  ♫

383
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,670
♫  It feels like I'm on the edge of the ring  ♫

384
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:51,550
♫  Climb high without hesitating, want to be higher  ♫

385
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:58,790
♫  You already expect it to happen, get up again and stare back at it  ♫

386
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:02,740
♫  It kind of bothers me, but you stand no chance  ♫
