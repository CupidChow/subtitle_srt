00:00:11,735 --> 00:00:12,796
Don't leave.

6
00:00:29,885 --> 00:00:30,915
Hey.

7
00:00:32,286 --> 00:00:34,055
What's wrong with you?

8
00:00:36,585 --> 00:00:39,125
Who is that person?

9
00:00:45,595 --> 00:00:47,296
Deal with Kang Na Eon first.

10
00:00:48,536 --> 00:00:49,636
If you can't deal with her,

11
00:00:50,765 --> 00:00:51,936
I won't let you slide.

12
00:01:13,226 --> 00:01:15,196
Is it this punk's face that's the problem?

13
00:01:26,076 --> 00:01:27,404

(Branding in Seongsu)

16
00:02:10,115 --> 00:02:12,184
Hey! That's...

17
00:02:12,185 --> 00:02:14,684
What's the matter? Friends can share the same drink.

18
00:02:14,685 --> 00:02:16,385
Hey. Don't drink that!

19
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:19,096
Hey! You startled me.

20
00:02:19,626 --> 00:02:21,626
Friends don't do that. You punk.

21
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:23,494
- But... - I'm off.

22
00:02:23,495 --> 00:02:24,566
Hey!

23
00:02:25,096 --> 00:02:26,965
Hey, Na Eon! Kang Na Eon!

24
00:02:30,036 --> 00:02:31,805
She has a peach allergy.

25
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:34,076
Is she okay?

26
00:02:44,546 --> 00:02:46,185
Is she still not back?

27
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:48,455
With my hot body?

28
00:02:54,156 --> 00:02:55,726
What's this?

29
00:03:02,205 --> 00:03:04,265
Na Eon!

30
00:03:04,365 --> 00:03:06,674
I don't care what you do with Yoo Mi,

31
00:03:06,675 --> 00:03:09,545
but help me with this!

32
00:03:09,546 --> 00:03:11,406
It feels so itchy!

33
00:03:13,976 --> 00:03:16,515
(Ms. Kang Na Eon)

34
00:03:20,955 --> 00:03:23,355
Eun Ho is dying here!

35
00:03:23,356 --> 00:03:25,255
Gosh!

36
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:27,055
- Darn it. - It's so itchy.

37
00:03:30,265 --> 00:03:32,135
The third drawer of the desk in the study.

38
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:33,136
(Send)

39
00:03:45,846 --> 00:03:48,386
So you'll be staying outside like this?

40
00:03:49,215 --> 00:03:50,484
(So Eun Ho)

41
00:03:50,485 --> 00:03:53,386
I can be a scary person if I try to be.

42
00:04:11,536 --> 00:04:12,805
Kang Na Eon's image?

43
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:15,075
I will make sure to destroy it.

44
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:19,745
Hi!

45
00:04:32,156 --> 00:04:35,026
Are you still drunk? Your outfit looks...

46
00:04:37,365 --> 00:04:39,465
Goodness. Including your makeup,

47
00:04:39,466 --> 00:04:40,495
it looks quite messy.

48
00:04:40,596 --> 00:04:41,706
It's like she's from the year 2000.

49
00:04:42,836 --> 00:04:44,835
What's wrong with you two? I'm dressed to kill.

50
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:46,135
Stop joking around.

51
00:04:46,606 --> 00:04:48,846
- It wasn't a joke. - I wasn't joking.

52
00:04:50,945 --> 00:04:52,716
- As planned. - Right.

53
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:54,276
Where's So Eun Ho?

54
00:04:54,315 --> 00:04:56,015
Our Sexy Beast...

55
00:04:56,016 --> 00:04:58,345
came to work early and left right away.

56
00:04:58,346 --> 00:04:59,685
Did he go to the first floor?

57
00:05:00,956 --> 00:05:03,786
But I'm quite sharp with things.

58
00:05:05,956 --> 00:05:09,226
He came in the same outfit as yesterday.

59
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:12,135
He must've spent the night somewhere else. My gosh!

60
00:05:12,396 --> 00:05:14,665
That's understandable if it's Eun Ho.

61
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:17,206
He has a nice face and body. He's allowed to do that.

62
00:05:19,536 --> 00:05:20,805
I won't let this slide.

63
00:05:21,106 --> 00:05:22,345
Darn it.

64
00:05:22,346 --> 00:05:23,406
Listen!

65
00:05:24,206 --> 00:05:27,476
As soon as you see So Eun Ho, you bring him to me. Get it?

66
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:28,786
- Got it. - Got it.

67
00:05:28,985 --> 00:05:30,016
Darn it.

68
00:05:32,786 --> 00:05:33,856
What's this?

69
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:37,385
The mighty So Eun Ho even makes a mistake like this.

70
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:38,825
What's this?

71
00:05:39,796 --> 00:05:41,155
My goodness.

72
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:42,495
Isn't that Nam Yoon Hyuk?

73
00:05:42,565 --> 00:05:43,865
Did you make the offer?

74
00:05:44,365 --> 00:05:45,466
Who's this?

75
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:47,565
The sex symbol of this generation.

76
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:49,766
The dangerous man.

77
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:54,105
- You made this image of his. - Come on.

78
00:05:54,106 --> 00:05:56,674
What's so amazing about a commercial model?

79
00:05:56,675 --> 00:05:57,744
(High alcohol degree soju, targeting the niche market)

80
00:05:57,745 --> 00:05:59,215
Take a look at this.

81
00:05:59,216 --> 00:06:01,374
Who drinks high alcohol degree drinks these days?

82
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:04,546
Gosh. He hasn't been doing his research properly.

83
00:06:04,586 --> 00:06:07,814
Gosh. Strong drinks are great.

84
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:11,555
You get drunk quickly and move on to the next level.

85
00:06:11,925 --> 00:06:14,796
Come on. You're such a creep, Princess!

86
00:06:16,325 --> 00:06:19,595
But if you're with Nam Yoon Hyuk,

87
00:06:19,596 --> 00:06:21,364
you can feel totally drunk...

88
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:23,705
even without a single drop of alcohol.

89
00:06:23,706 --> 00:06:24,836
Just by his eyes.

90
00:06:25,836 --> 00:06:27,305
My gosh, sis.

91
00:06:27,435 --> 00:06:29,645
You're not afraid to express yourself. Unbelievable!

92
00:06:29,646 --> 00:06:30,745
Come on.

93
00:06:32,146 --> 00:06:33,175
Right.

94
00:06:34,016 --> 00:06:37,145
You don't have to get drunk.

95
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,155
Right. Jenny doesn't drink that well,

96
00:06:39,156 --> 00:06:40,555
but she's always there.

97
00:06:41,185 --> 00:06:44,155
She might be enjoying the atmosphere of the party.

98
00:06:44,156 --> 00:06:46,955
It could be the vibe of the place...

99
00:06:46,956 --> 00:06:48,864
Yes! Jenny!

100
00:06:48,865 --> 00:06:51,265
I almost got deaf!

101
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:53,596
Where is Jenny right now? Did she not come to work?

102
00:06:54,466 --> 00:06:57,265
- I don't know who she is. - Hey, come on.

103
00:06:57,266 --> 00:06:59,336
Can we get the staff info?

104
00:07:00,135 --> 00:07:02,345
Ms. Kang, instead,

105
00:07:02,346 --> 00:07:04,106
this will make more sense.

106
00:07:05,546 --> 00:07:07,016
"Goodbye, everyone."

107
00:07:07,146 --> 00:07:10,585
I will free myself from all chains of this world.

108
00:07:10,586 --> 00:07:12,315
I'm off to find my own source of happiness.

109
00:07:13,055 --> 00:07:14,215
Bye.

110
00:07:14,216 --> 00:07:15,356
(Goodbye, Seongsu Agency.)

111
00:07:17,356 --> 00:07:19,956
No! Don't leave, Jenny!

112
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:22,865
- What's wrong with her? - That's what I want to ask.

113
00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:28,805
Oh, Jenny!

114
00:07:29,235 --> 00:07:31,005
Jenny!

115
00:07:35,175 --> 00:07:36,206
Jenny!

116
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,546
Oh, Jenny!

117
00:07:37,846 --> 00:07:39,146
Jenny!

118
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:44,416
Jenny, are you okay?

119
00:07:44,786 --> 00:07:47,315
- What are you doing? - Jenny!

120
00:07:47,485 --> 00:07:49,585
Life must've been hard and painful for you,

121
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:52,124
but you can't give up on your life so easily like this.

122
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,156
What?

123
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:55,526
Why would I do that?

124
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:56,766
But...

125
00:07:57,466 --> 00:07:58,796
on your social media account,

126
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:00,295
you posted, "Goodbye, everyone."

127
00:08:00,296 --> 00:08:03,364
- "I'm off to a new world." - What are you saying?

128
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:04,706
I'm lost for words.

129
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:08,606
(Reserved)

130
00:08:13,175 --> 00:08:14,776
So that wasn't what you meant?

131
00:08:23,226 --> 00:08:24,925
You got an offer to become an influencer?

132
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:34,266
"Hello."

133
00:08:34,465 --> 00:08:36,464
"This is the professional influencer agency,"

134
00:08:36,465 --> 00:08:37,866
"Instar Entertainment."

135
00:08:38,565 --> 00:08:40,435
"For each post, 1,000 dollars will be..."

136
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,646
A thousand dollars?

137
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:45,546
Everything has been settled last night.

138
00:08:49,786 --> 00:08:51,815
So that guy you met last night...

139
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:55,656
Please be quick with my resignation.

140
00:08:56,185 --> 00:08:57,486
Nice and quick.

141
00:08:58,626 --> 00:09:02,396
But Jenny, we...

142
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:03,725
Bye!

143
00:09:04,425 --> 00:09:05,465
But...

144
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:14,435
Instar Entertainment.

145
00:09:16,376 --> 00:09:17,444
(Your endless potential with Instar Entertainment)

146
00:09:17,445 --> 00:09:18,645
(You can become the star that moves the future.)

147
00:09:18,646 --> 00:09:23,585
(Instar Entertainment, CEO Ahn Byung Dal)

148
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,685
Come on. This is a total fraud.

149
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:30,954
(Instar Entertainment)

150
00:09:30,955 --> 00:09:32,996
You may think it's a bit excessive.

151
00:09:33,425 --> 00:09:35,526
But the conditions are all favorable for you.

152
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:43,564
Can't it be shortened to three lines?

153
00:09:43,565 --> 00:09:46,136
Oh, my gosh, Jenny!

154
00:09:48,136 --> 00:09:51,675
It has been written with care.

155
00:09:52,116 --> 00:09:56,245
I even wrote it all in English just for you.

156
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:58,116
Gosh. Why is it in English?

157
00:10:02,486 --> 00:10:03,786
It's 1,000 dollars.

158
00:10:13,636 --> 00:10:15,766
Well, it sounds about right.

159
00:10:16,536 --> 00:10:18,565
When should I start posting?

160
00:10:20,475 --> 00:10:21,575
Right now?

161
00:10:22,345 --> 00:10:23,805
There's a job for me already?

162
00:10:24,105 --> 00:10:27,416
Of course. You bet there is.

163
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:35,455
Go up there and dance.

164
00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:37,325
What?

165
00:10:37,955 --> 00:10:40,626
Make it sexy.

166
00:10:41,126 --> 00:10:43,796
Gosh! You piece of trash!

167
00:10:45,866 --> 00:10:48,496
Let go of me! I said let go!

168
00:10:49,965 --> 00:10:51,305
Didn't you read the contract?

169
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:52,906
Article 6, Section 1.

170
00:10:53,475 --> 00:10:55,036
With a breach of contract,

171
00:10:55,605 --> 00:10:57,745
the subject that is liable...

172
00:10:57,746 --> 00:11:00,546
must pay a penalty of 20 times the signing fee.

173
00:11:02,016 --> 00:11:03,616
Since the signing fee was 10,000 dollars,

174
00:11:04,786 --> 00:11:05,855
that's 200,000 dollars.

175
00:11:08,455 --> 00:11:11,355
If you're rich enough, you can pay your way out.

176
00:11:12,526 --> 00:11:13,626
If you're not,

177
00:11:14,555 --> 00:11:16,626
start dancing.

178
00:11:19,866 --> 00:11:21,035
Don't you know who I am?

179
00:11:21,036 --> 00:11:22,435
- Stop. - What's wrong with you?

180
00:11:22,605 --> 00:11:24,605
- You can't go in. - I can't believe you guys.

181
00:11:25,876 --> 00:11:27,204
You can't be like this.

182
00:11:27,205 --> 00:11:29,674
Why not? Tell me!

183
00:11:29,675 --> 00:11:31,104
Why is it so loud?

184
00:11:31,105 --> 00:11:32,246
How can you not recognize...

185
00:11:32,575 --> 00:11:34,215
Kang Na Bong?

186
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:42,986
Gyaru

187
00:11:43,156 --> 00:11:45,054
Super cute gyaru

188
00:11:45,055 --> 00:11:46,625
I like my pretty self

189
00:11:46,626 --> 00:11:47,796
Want to play with me?

190
00:11:54,496 --> 00:11:56,535
Who is this? Is she crazy?

191
00:11:56,536 --> 00:11:58,406
No!

192
00:11:59,276 --> 00:12:02,005
I'm the creator with one million subscribers, Kang Na Bong.

193
00:12:02,006 --> 00:12:06,245
How can someone in the social media industry...

194
00:12:06,246 --> 00:12:08,145
not know Kang Na Bong?

195
00:12:08,146 --> 00:12:10,585
Kang Na Bong? I've never heard of that name.

196
00:12:10,845 --> 00:12:12,185
Look her up.

197
00:12:12,386 --> 00:12:13,416
Forget it!

198
00:12:17,156 --> 00:12:21,594
Are you aware that Jenny is part of Sandbocks with me...

199
00:12:21,595 --> 00:12:24,565
before trying to steal her away?

200
00:12:24,695 --> 00:12:25,695
Sandbocks?

201
00:12:26,236 --> 00:12:27,236
The Sandbocks we all know?

202
00:12:27,237 --> 00:12:28,695
Yes, that's right.

203
00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:31,705
What should we do?

204
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,736
Shall we let my one million subscribers know...

205
00:12:35,376 --> 00:12:37,046
that you were trying to...

206
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,575
pull off a scam?

207
00:12:40,215 --> 00:12:41,944
Was that what you were doing?

208
00:12:41,945 --> 00:12:44,915
No. It was nothing like that.

209
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:47,286
Right? It wasn't, right?

210
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:49,855
Then I shall bring back...

211
00:12:50,685 --> 00:12:52,225
with my Jenny.

212
00:12:53,595 --> 00:12:54,694
Sure.

213
00:12:54,695 --> 00:12:57,225
- Hey, escort them. Of course. - Right.

214
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:58,565
This way.

215
00:13:00,695 --> 00:13:02,434
How did you get here, Ms. Kang?

216
00:13:02,435 --> 00:13:04,064
We've looked it up everywhere.

217
00:13:04,065 --> 00:13:06,205
There's no one called Kang Na Bong.

218
00:13:06,435 --> 00:13:08,945
Jenny, it was so obvious. How could you fall for that?

219
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,304
Head out naturally.

220
00:13:10,305 --> 00:13:13,175
What? Hey, Kang Na Bong!

221
00:13:14,276 --> 00:13:15,345
What do we do now?

222
00:13:15,815 --> 00:13:17,814
Look natural.

223
00:13:17,815 --> 00:13:19,814
Kang Na Bong.

224
00:13:19,815 --> 00:13:21,916
What is it? Gosh.

225
00:13:22,526 --> 00:13:23,725
Gyaru!

226
00:13:24,225 --> 00:13:25,555
- Gyaru! - Gyaru!

227
00:13:26,095 --> 00:13:27,626
You almost got me.

228
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:30,725
Jenny. Run at one.

229
00:13:31,695 --> 00:13:32,835
One!

230
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,666
Run!

231
00:13:36,906 --> 00:13:37,935
Where do we go?

232
00:13:39,776 --> 00:13:40,934
Stop right there!

233
00:13:40,935 --> 00:13:41,975
Here.

234
00:13:42,136 --> 00:13:43,275
- Come this way. - Hey!

235
00:13:43,276 --> 00:13:44,974
- Stop right there! - Stop right there!

236
00:13:44,975 --> 00:13:46,016
That way.

237
00:13:46,276 --> 00:13:47,515
- Hey. - That way!

238
00:13:47,516 --> 00:13:48,646
Gosh!

239
00:13:52,886 --> 00:13:54,115
What's wrong with you?

240
00:13:54,116 --> 00:13:55,515
Watch where you're going!

241
00:13:55,516 --> 00:13:56,554
- Kang Na Bong! - Get them!

242
00:13:56,555 --> 00:13:58,824
Kang Na Bong!

243
00:13:58,825 --> 00:13:59,955
Hey!

244
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:04,165
- Stop right there! - Gosh!

245
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,695
Stop right there!

246
00:14:06,036 --> 00:14:08,195
- Stop right there! - Stop right there!

247
00:14:09,236 --> 00:14:10,435
Gosh!

248
00:14:27,555 --> 00:14:28,855
Isn't that Kang Na Eon?

249
00:14:32,085 --> 00:14:34,055
Looks like we don't need to pay attention to them.

250
00:14:34,325 --> 00:14:35,425
What's going on?

251
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:43,335
Gosh!

252
00:14:44,506 --> 00:14:45,975
Stop following us!

253
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,006
- Sir! - Sir!

254
00:14:50,075 --> 00:14:51,775
- What's wrong with you? - Whatever!

255
00:14:51,776 --> 00:14:53,046
Why aren't they giving up?

256
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:56,945
- Get them! - Right.

257
00:15:00,886 --> 00:15:02,656
- There? - No. Here.

258
00:15:08,996 --> 00:15:10,695
Help me.

259
00:15:13,095 --> 00:15:14,695
- You go. - Hold on!

260
00:15:16,266 --> 00:15:17,266
Get them.

261
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:20,005
- Run! - You go.

262
00:15:20,006 --> 00:15:21,975
- You go. - Run!

263
00:15:22,975 --> 00:15:24,046
Jenny!

264
00:15:24,105 --> 00:15:25,146
Ms. Kang!

265
00:15:35,986 --> 00:15:37,756
Jenny! Stairs!

266
00:15:50,305 --> 00:15:51,434
Get them!

267
00:15:51,435 --> 00:15:53,075
Run!

268
00:15:56,746 --> 00:15:57,776
- Hurry! - Get them!

269
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:10,955
- Oh, my gosh! - What?

270
00:16:11,085 --> 00:16:13,455
- What are you doing? - Gosh!

271
00:16:13,496 --> 00:16:16,766
- Sir. - Don't touch me!

272
00:16:19,935 --> 00:16:22,465
- Let's go to the hospital. - Yes.

273
00:16:27,105 --> 00:16:28,575
You owe us one, Jenny.

274
00:16:33,876 --> 00:16:35,315
Slowly!

275
00:16:36,585 --> 00:16:37,585
- Gosh. - Gosh.

276
00:16:42,585 --> 00:16:44,725
All right. Take each other's hand.

277
00:16:45,185 --> 00:16:46,354
Take them.

278
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:48,954
Oh, come on. Stretch out your hands. Hold hands.

279
00:16:48,955 --> 00:16:51,925
Are you two kids? I guess they're just kids. Gosh.

280
00:16:53,835 --> 00:16:55,835
Our school closed down last year.

281
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:58,736
We were all shocked by it. That was why I ruined my exam.

282
00:17:02,476 --> 00:17:05,175
- Don't cry. You have to look nice. - Teacher!

283
00:17:05,176 --> 00:17:06,776
Thank you so much.

284
00:17:08,016 --> 00:17:09,286
You don't even know anything.

285
00:17:11,016 --> 00:17:12,216
So you went through that?

286
00:17:13,585 --> 00:17:14,585
I had no idea.

287
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:16,955
Besides, whether if we're high school grads or college grads,

288
00:17:16,956 --> 00:17:19,756
aren't we all the same if we're in the same company?

289
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:22,664
Was it right for me to keep it in?

290
00:17:22,665 --> 00:17:24,195
Of course not!

291
00:17:24,196 --> 00:17:27,296
Director Hwang Je Ha? He's the jerk.

292
00:17:28,365 --> 00:17:29,805
I'm sorry for getting mad at you.

293
00:17:36,976 --> 00:17:38,176
Come on.

294
00:17:38,645 --> 00:17:40,675
She apologized to you.

295
00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:41,946
You should accept her apology.

296
00:17:42,276 --> 00:17:44,915
And tell her you're sorry for calling her an old fart.

297
00:17:45,415 --> 00:17:46,456
She is an old fart.

298
00:17:46,855 --> 00:17:48,486
Seriously?

299
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:50,555
- Jenny! - But...

300
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:54,125
I'll take back what I said about her looking 30 years older.

301
00:17:54,696 --> 00:17:56,325
That was a lie.

302
00:17:57,196 --> 00:18:00,065
Jenny, don't be messing around now. You should make a proper apology.

303
00:18:01,796 --> 00:18:02,805
Really?

304
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:07,206
Gosh.

305
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,446
You were lying about me looking 30 years older?

306
00:18:10,345 --> 00:18:11,506
Then how old do I look?

307
00:18:11,706 --> 00:18:14,216
Just two years older than me?

308
00:18:14,345 --> 00:18:17,246
Oh, come on! That's just too much!

309
00:18:18,115 --> 00:18:20,115
I knew Jenny was a nice one.

310
00:18:20,956 --> 00:18:22,216
Young Ae!

311
00:18:23,526 --> 00:18:26,155
So this is how you make up?

312
00:18:27,296 --> 00:18:28,456
Why not?

313
00:18:30,365 --> 00:18:31,365
Never mind.

314
00:18:32,466 --> 00:18:34,436
But what do we do now?

315
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:38,036
Jenny, oh, Jenny!

316
00:18:38,266 --> 00:18:40,074
You were singing out her name.

317
00:18:40,075 --> 00:18:41,375
- Right. - Me?

318
00:18:42,036 --> 00:18:43,105
Why?

319
00:18:45,746 --> 00:18:48,645
There's something only Jenny can do.

320
00:18:51,145 --> 00:18:52,185
One, two, three.

321
00:18:52,186 --> 00:18:53,614
- Let's go! - Let's go! Let's do this!

322
00:18:53,615 --> 00:18:54,756
Okay.

323
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:57,325
Okay.

324
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:18,875
All right.

325
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,414
Let's make this work.

326
00:19:22,415 --> 00:19:23,645
Keep your eyes open!

327
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:26,154
Jenny, hang in there.

328
00:19:26,155 --> 00:19:27,615
I will do the clicking.

329
00:19:27,986 --> 00:19:30,855
That isn't the mouse, Jenny. It's right here.

330
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:32,486
Take a look at this.

331
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,256
I want you to make this point stand out.

332
00:19:52,145 --> 00:19:53,915
We'll keep going.

333
00:20:02,256 --> 00:20:05,026
Whatever! Underdog will take the win!

334
00:20:05,486 --> 00:20:07,026
This is the start of a war.

335
00:20:15,065 --> 00:20:17,105
Great. I like it.

336
00:20:17,436 --> 00:20:18,436
(Thank you for loving Seoul Soshin High School.)

337
00:20:18,437 --> 00:20:20,036
Jenny's school looks great. Why did it get closed down?

338
00:20:20,936 --> 00:20:22,206
We'll do it here.

339
00:20:24,746 --> 00:20:26,515
- Jenny! - Teacher.

340
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:28,245
- Thank you! - Thank you!

341
00:20:28,246 --> 00:20:29,246
Don't mention it.

342
00:20:29,716 --> 00:20:31,084
It's all because...

343
00:20:31,085 --> 00:20:32,956
Jenny was a great student.

344
00:20:33,855 --> 00:20:35,486
What? Her?

345
00:20:36,456 --> 00:20:38,486
- Hi! - Jenny!

346
00:20:38,726 --> 00:20:39,854
Hi!

347
00:20:39,855 --> 00:20:41,394
- Oh, hello. - Hello.

348
00:20:41,395 --> 00:20:42,496
He's my BF.

349
00:20:43,466 --> 00:20:46,335
This guy will do something amazing.

350
00:20:49,405 --> 00:20:50,936
We'll use this as the main photo.

351
00:20:51,805 --> 00:20:53,436
Why don't we use this as the product photo?

352
00:20:54,605 --> 00:20:56,874
- Are there more photos? - Yes.

353
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,206
I like this one better.

354
00:20:58,476 --> 00:20:59,716
Then we'll use these.

355
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:07,786
Na Eon?

356
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:11,256
Na Eon?

357
00:22:19,855 --> 00:22:20,855
Gosh.

358
00:22:40,216 --> 00:22:41,345
Whisky.

359
00:22:48,355 --> 00:22:49,355
The atmosphere.

360
00:22:49,756 --> 00:22:51,756
With the atmosphere...

361
00:22:52,895 --> 00:22:54,426
Get drunk with the atmosphere.

362
00:22:54,726 --> 00:22:55,854
(The most dangerous soju in the world)

363
00:22:55,855 --> 00:22:57,595
(Top star Nam Yoon Hyuk's personal soju rebranding)

364
00:23:04,036 --> 00:23:06,206
The point is the atmosphere.

365
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,676
We'll go with that point here.

366
00:23:14,115 --> 00:23:15,246
The atmosphere.

367
00:23:27,325 --> 00:23:32,865
(Correct method of taking medication)

368
00:23:34,796 --> 00:23:36,265
Hey! That's...

369
00:23:36,266 --> 00:23:38,664
What's the matter? Friends can share the same drink.

370
00:23:38,665 --> 00:23:40,036
She has a peach allergy.

371
00:23:47,746 --> 00:23:49,045
