1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,950
   

2
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:09,340
   

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,640
   

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:17,810


5
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,310
The pop-up rental deal Team Leader Kang Na Eon tried to get was canceled

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:25,890
and the construction for our jewelry pop-up is going well.

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,700
How about their artwork? Did you make sure to get rid of it?

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,280
Yes, I deleted all of it.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,240
Good work.

10
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:37,350
I should stop by the jewelry pop-up store location.

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,440
I'm curious what kind of place she chose.

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:44,860
Her taste is actually pretty bad.

13
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:53,260
- What? It was this place? 
 - You came.

14
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,080
Hello.

15
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,130
This is the same place we always use.

16
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,060
The only bad thing is it gets low traffic.

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,090
There is usually more foot traffic,

18
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:04,390
but a pop-up store opened over there today.

19
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:06,310
- A pop-up? 
 - Yes.

20
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,740
- Isn't that it? 
 - That must be Team Leader Kang Na Eon's pop-up.

21
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,150
- I think you're right. 
 - Let's go over there right now.

22
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:15,630
- Where is it? 
 - Isn't that it?

23
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,130
- Is that it? 
 - Is that right?

24
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,340
 Let's go in. 

25
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,080
Welcome! 
    

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,160
There are a lot of people in there.

27
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,310
What's all this? 
    

28
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,970
Thank you.

29
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,070
Have a sexy time, okay?

30
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:45,660
It's a lipstick. It's easy to carry it around.

31
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,100
We keep getting customers.

32
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:48,110
Focus.

33
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,900
- Welcome. 
 - Welcome.

34
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,250
We have all sorts of things. 
    

35
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:55,340
Hello. We support women's healthy sex life.

36
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,550
Absolutely.

37
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,940
- It never tears. 
 - May I introduce you to our secret weapon?

38
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:03,030
This is a sexy pharmacy pop-up.

39
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,960
- Yes, it is. 
 - Good to see you.

40
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,960
- Love you. 
 - Love you.

41
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,610
Huh? Team Leader Do?

42
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,510
Yes, thank you.

43
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,050
Let me go instead.

44
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,800
I'm Kang Na Eon, you know?

45
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:53,290
   

46
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:55,070
   

47
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,800
   

48
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,160
   

49
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,680
   

50
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:17,690
   

51
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:24,070
You must have somehow used your head.

52
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,780
Thanks to you.

53
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,940
By the way,

54
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:33,470
a location and art concept like this

55
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:38,520
will probably cost you a lot in rental and design fees.

56
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,200
Are you sure you can handle it?

57
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,570
You probably didn't get a quote since you were in a hurry.

58
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:47,180
Don't cry when you get the bills later.

59
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,750
Gosh, oh, no...

60
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:54,640
You didn't know the Underdog Team has a different budget than Team 1, right?

61
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,740
Wow, you should have told me sooner.

62
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,080
Sorry.

63
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,010
If I knew we had a budget,

64
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,120
I would've actually spent some money...

65
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,630
What?

66
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,300
 What should we do? 

67
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,980
 We can't reach the owner right now since they're on vacation. 

68
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,300
 What do we do? 

69
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,530
 By the way, this is a crazy coincidence. 

70
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:34,400
 You know the owner of the pharmacy that closed? 

71
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,400
 She's the wife of the doctor who delivered my five sons. 

72
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,100
 Seriously, what a small world. 

73
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,770
 How is this even possible? Isn't it crazy? 

74
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,230
 - I couldn't believe it. 
 - Yeong Ae... 

75
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:46,380
 there's no time to talk about that now. 

76
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:52,970
 Wait, Yeong Ae, could we use that crazy coincidence somehow? 

77
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:56,150
 You gave me the chills. Why didn't I think of that? 

78
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,870
 My gosh, you really are the best. 

79
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,840
 I'm pretty persuasive. Just give me one second. 

80
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,360
 Okay. 

81
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,450
 I'll call her right now. 

82
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:07,400
 Heavenly Father, please... 

83
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,490
 Don't get your hopes up too much. 

84
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,850
 Why not? 

85
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,930
 You never know. Yeong Ae might score us a deal. 

86
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,500
 Seriously. 

87
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,130
 They're closed but still have a month left until the lease ends. 

88
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,420
 They told us to use it rent-free. 

89
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,400
 See? I told you it'd work, Sunbae. I told you it'd work! 

90
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,650
 My goodness. My goodness! 

91
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,850
 Jenny, take this. We don't need it. 

92
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:36,220
 Me? 

93
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:38,070
 Hey, Rex! 

94
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,390
 Gosh, a princess can't do stuff like this though. 

95
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:43,790
 Gosh, you're getting dust everywhere. 

96
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:45,960
 Move this. 

97
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,140
 - Jenny, Jenny. 
 - Higher, higher. 

98
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,900
 Lift it higher, Jenny. 

99
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,840
 I'm trying. It's heavy. 

100
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,840
 It's heavy for me, too. Hurry up, Jenny. 

101
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:06,300
 Gosh, my Nana's so pretty. 

102
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,770
 Gosh, it's a work of art. 

103
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:11,900
 We don't have time. We really don't. 

104
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,610
 It would have been so nice to have the art team's design. 

105
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:16,350
 What's the point of doing this forever? 

106
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,040
 We lost everything. 

107
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:20,050
 What are we supposed to do at this point? 

108
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,720
 What do we do? What do we do? Seriously. 

109
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,520
 Gosh, so annoying. 

110
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:34,050
 People call it stalking when you do this. 

111
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:41,230
 I get to decide if my team deletes or saves artwork. 

112
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,170
 Can I see your computer? 

113
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,410
 You can't. 

114
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:45,790
 Delete what you've been working on immediately. 

115
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,910
 - I don't want to! 
 - What do you mean, delete? 

116
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,610
 What are you doing? Stop! Stop! 

117
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:54,090
 Stop pushing! Stop! 

118
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,150
 What are you doing right now? 

119
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,580
 This is what they mean by "sincerity." 

120
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:11,880
 Why don't you give it to Team Leader Kang yourself, then? 

121
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,840
 If I do that, you could call it an obsession. 

122
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,540
 Rex. 

123
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,520
 - What's this? 
 - It survived. 

124
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,160
 The design. 

125
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,880
 My gosh, Honey. 

126
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,890
 I love you. 

127
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,580
 It's my face! 

128
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:02,600
 - Hold on. 
 - What do you mean "Hold on"? 

129
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,910
 - Are you done? 
 - Yes. 

130
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,500
Well?

131
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,840
We'll just have to spend the rest of the budget on the next project.

132
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,900
We'll keep collaborating with the art team, too.

133
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,040
I don't care what you do.

134
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,810
- Gosh. 
 - Team Leader!

135
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:42,410
Where are you going, Team Leader?

136
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,050
- Team Leader. 
 - Team Leader.

137
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:47,700
I can go on my own. Don't follow me.

138
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,800
- Do Yu Mi... 
 - If you tell us where you're headed...

139
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,650
must've been affected a lot.

140
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,470
Stop following me, I said!

141
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,710
Hey, that must be it. It's the pop-up Team Leader Kang Na Eon put together after returning.

142
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:02,730
- Wow, it sure is different. 
 - Shit.

143
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,840
I think so, too.

144
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:12,280
But seriously,

145
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,700
who do you think is behind Team Leader Do?

146
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,310
I think we'll be able to find that out today.

147
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,540
 The customer is not available... 

148
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:23,650
 I need to see you right now. 

149
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,230
Go home as soon as you're done.

150
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:28,750
Pardon?

151
00:09:29,990 --> 00:09:31,700
Wait, Sunbae. Sun-

152
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,050
Is this the pop-up store?

153
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,810
Yes, it is. Let's go inside.

154
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,470
Pardon me.

155
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,740
Please follow that car. Hurry.

156
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:07,130
Shit!

157
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,760
Kang Na Eon!

158
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,930
That's so Do Yu Mi.

159
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:46,450
I knew this would happen. That's why I asked you to take care of Kang—

160
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,970
What are you doing here?

161
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,440
What?

162
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,700
Am I not supposed to be here?

163
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:59,890
I'm not in the mood to joke around right now.

164
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,570
Open it.

165
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:07,140
Open it, I said!

166
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,590
I'm not joking around.

167
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:12,540
Let go.

168
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,820
I've been thinking. I wondered if Yu Mi pushed Team Leader Kang...

169
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,820
like this, you know.

170
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,580
What are you trying to say?

171
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:33,180
I'm saying I saw everything.

172
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:49,060
   

173
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,650
   

174
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:21,850
After the XU issue came to the surface, and the accident happened to Kang Na Eon...

175
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:26,900
Yu Mi happened to become the team leader of Team 1.

176
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,690
You tried to kill Kang Na Eon.

177
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,240
Isn't that pretty plausible?

178
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,270
Yu Mi...

179
00:12:42,270 --> 00:12:45,710
Just do as much as you can for the person...

180
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:49,050
who's backing you.

181
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,810
What?

182
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:07,400
What's this?

183
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:13,490
Hold on, hold on! I didn't touch you! I didn't!

184
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,390
Team Leader Nam?

185
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,590
It looks like the bug got caught.

186
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,390
What is this?

187
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,910
What are you doing here?

188
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:44,650
First off...

189
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:46,190
Let's get out of here.

190
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,830
Let go!

191
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:50,710
I don't need help from Kang Na Eon's people!

192
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,960
Calm down, Sunbae.

193
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,840
Calm down.

194
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,500
Why?

195
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:01,960
Are you here to threaten me, too?

196
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,690
Did Kang Na Eon tell you to?

197
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:07,860
Are you here to say I tried to kill her to take her position?

198
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,040
I came because I was worried.

199
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,740
What?

200
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:18,230
When you left after talking to Team Leader Kang,

201
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:20,850
you looked anxious and tired.

202
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,200
That's why I followed you.

203
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,110
What do you know about me?

204
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,760
I've been...

205
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,530
used by Team Leader Kang, too.

206
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:38,250
I know how you feel... better than anyone.

207
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,120
I...

208
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,130
I swear I didn't do it.

209
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,630
I swear it wasn't me.

210
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,520
I really...

211
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,280
I really didn't do it.

212
00:14:56,200 --> 00:15:00,490
I didn't know things would end up this way.

213
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:03,020
- I'm serious. 
 - It's okay.

214
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,870
You didn't do...

215
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:09,660
anything wrong.

216
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,170
I just hated Na Eon so much.

217
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:19,340
All I did was blow the whistle.

218
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,280
Flawsome.

219
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,780
A marketing strategy that reveals a brand's flaw or weakness

220
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:28,740
so it appears relatable to the consumers. 
    

221
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,240
People are the same way.

222
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,740
If you think you share each other's flaws,

223
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,200
you end up opening yourself up.

224
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,330
 If it wasn't you, 

225
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,590
 who did that to Kang Na Eon? 

226
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:57,220
 You know, don't you, Sunbae? 

227
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,700
 What's with you? 

228
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,380
 You said you aren't on her side. 

229
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,550
 Why do you want to know the culprit then? 

230
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:13,280
 I need to have what she wants the most to win the fight against her. 

231
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,570
 How am I supposed to trust you? 

232
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,940
 Right now, 

233
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,960
 I'm here right in front of you to rescue you. 

234
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,720
 If you don't believe me, 

235
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:31,920
 I'll take care of them one by one. 

236
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,830
 Whether it's Team Leader Kang or Nam, 

237
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,750
 anyone who gives you a hard time. All of them. 

238
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:46,270
 Is there someone else by chance? 

239
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,960
Just wait and see, Do Yu Mi.

240
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:58,140
The entire office will see this tomorrow morning.

241
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,010
What's this?

242
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:07,140
Why is this powered off?

243
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,340
I think I saw them messing with this earlier.

244
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:17,660
Where is it?

245
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,860
You need to inquire with the maintenance team about the screen.

246
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,090
Aren't you the new employee?

247
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,610
W-What? What?

248
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,200
Hey, give that back.

249
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:52,500
W-What are you looking at?

250
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,890
Gosh, seriously.

251
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:55,190
You piece of trash.

252
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,790
H-Hey, that's...

253
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,080
Hey, hey, that's... W-Why are you taking pictures of them?

254
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,090
You can't even switch jobs anymore.

255
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:18,850
Gosh, I was going to take it easy, but how dare you treat your Sunbae...

256
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,650
Where are you going?

257
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,080
The maintenance office.

258
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,630
You son of a bitch.

259
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:34,350
In a fight, the person who looks for a flaw is the one who wins.

260
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,390
F-Flaw?

261
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,130
Flaw.

262
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,950
Hey, hey...

263
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,760
Hey!

264
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:02,240
So Eun Ho.

265
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,290
So Eun Ho.

266
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,540
Hey, So Eun Ho.

267
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,380
So Eun Ho, wake up.

268
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:21,500
Hey, So Eun Ho.

269
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,170
So Eun Ho.

270
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:25,100
So Eun Ho!

271
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,220
Hey, So Eun Ho!

272
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:31,880
Geez...

273
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,820
It hurts.

274
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,940
I-It hurts...

275
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,920
What are you doing here?

276
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,450
Well, the thing is...

277
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,350
 I came home, but... 

278
00:19:51,350 --> 00:19:56,340
 I heard a strange noise in the room. 

279
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,510
I-I think that's when I passed out.

280
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,390
Is there a ghost in this house?

281
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,150
Are you saying you saw that, too?

282
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:29,440
What? Is there really a ghost, then?

283
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:33,360
Was the apartment kind of cheap by chance?

284
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:42,500
By the way, why did you come in here?

285
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,040
Sorry?

286
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:48,100
Why did you come into my walk-in closet?

287
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:54,800
It was kind of cold today. S-So I wanted a jacket.

288
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,930
Are you sure that's all?

289
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:00,160
I'm sure that's all.

290
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,720
Stop butting into everything I do.

291
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,490
I'll be in your business, too, then.

292
00:21:06,490 --> 00:21:08,570
Do as you'd like.

293
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,770
Okay.

294
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,730
Have you been with Yu Mi Sunbae all this time, by the way?

295
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:19,330
Why? What did you two do this late? Why all of a sudden?

296
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,490
What did you do? Come on and tell me right now.

297
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,460
I seduced Do Yu Mi.

298
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,390
What?

299
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,200
You asked me to tell you.

300
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,660
Sunbae!

301
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:35,220
Who wouldn't fall for someone so handsome with such a hot body like mine?

302
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:39,080
I've been doing fine as a loser with hidden strength.

303
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,210
Yes, you loser.

304
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,250
Could you leave now? I'm tired.

305
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,480
Hold on, what if she changes her profile picture or something tomorrow?

306
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:52,010
Did you sleep with her?

307
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,600
Not yet.

308
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,090
"Not yet"?

309
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,280
We'll have to be enemies for awhile.

310
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,000
I'm on Do Yu Mi's side starting today.

311
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,650
Well, then...

312
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:08,000
W-Well, hold on. L-Let go!

313
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,740
Get out!

314
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,100
You said Do Yu Mi was our enemy!

315
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,780
Open the door, Sunbae! Please?

316
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,320
 S-Sun... 

317
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,840
 Sunbae... 

318
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:39,400
 I'll take care of them one by one. 

319
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,680
 Anyone who gives you a hard time. All of them. 

320
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,540
 Is there someone else by chance? 

321
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:51,880
 I can't trust you. 

322
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:56,750
 We'll receive an important project from HQ next week. 

323
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,040
 Destroy Kang Na Eon using that. 

324
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,460
 Would you be able to do that? 

325
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:05,060
 Of course, I will. I'll do it for you. 

326
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,660
 It's a brand launched by Segye International last year. 

327
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:12,120
 The person in charge is Chief Hwang Jae Ha. 

328
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:18,380
 Do Yu Mi knows about Hwang Jae Ha's plans? 

329
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:30,460
 By chance... 

330
00:23:31,850 --> 00:23:35,080
 is the man behind Do Yu Mi... 

331
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:45,010
   

332
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:47,570
   

333
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:50,200
   

334
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,690
   

335
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,810
- Hwang Jae Ha? 
  - I love this idea so much. 

336
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,260
 - I'll give you a week. 
 - Excuse me? 

337
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:03,030
 Acquire it before the next board meeting. 

338
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:06,260
 You should have planned for the outcome if you were going to copy it. 

339
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,790
 How could you put us in this mess? 

340
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,340
 How will you take responsibility? 

341
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:14,880
 I'm responsible for the entire case since I'm the chief marketing director. 

342
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,420
   

343
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:21,070
   

344
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,500
Things are getting interesting.

345
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,580
   

346
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:40,280
M-Move, move, move... carefully...

347
00:24:45,090 --> 00:24:47,310
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

348
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,400
Did you do that?

349
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,110
I told you I'd do anything.

350
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,740
Did you see them holding hands?

351
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:06,020
I haven't even held that hand yet.

352
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,310
- Whatever. 
 - Gosh, gosh. She let go.

353
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:12,740
Shit. What's he thinking, exactly?

354
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,970
Good morning, Seongsu Agency.

355
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,960
Who is he?

356
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:38,250
I-I think he's someone high up.

357
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,970
He's not wearing socks.

358
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,010
Hwang Jae Ha.

359
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,330
Segye Group's Chairman Hwang Hyeon Cheol's third child.

360
00:25:58,330 --> 00:25:59,870
Vice President Hwang Sang Guk's only son.

361
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:01,710
He's turning 31 this year.

362
00:26:01,710 --> 00:26:04,320
After studying in the US

363
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,820
he was appointed director of Segye International, a subsidiary company of Segye Group, when he was only 25.

364
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:12,810
He benchmarked famous brands overseas and he launched various domestic brands.

365
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:16,900
However... everything he touched failed, and five years ago,

366
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,730
 his scented candle brand failed completely. 

367
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,470
 Gosh, it failed. Failed again! 

368
00:26:22,470 --> 00:26:24,410
He seemed to stay quiet for a while, but...

369
00:26:24,410 --> 00:26:27,090
He got into alcohol last year, so...

370
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:28,940
he launched Segye Soju.

371
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:33,010
But he failed miserably again. He's as known as...

372
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,990
- Segye Group's... 
 - Minus'...

373
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:37,200
- Hand. 
 - Hand.

374
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,470
Wow. Thank you for the helpful explanation.

375
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,830
- They're so good at explaining. 
 - So good.

376
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,590
You all know who I am, right?

377
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,810
I just heard.

378
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,230
You know me, though, Team Leader Kang.

379
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,670
It makes me so sad that you pretend not to know me.

380
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:00,410
Me?

381
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,210
Of course, I know you, Chief Hwang Jae Ha.

382
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,590
Have you been well?

383
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:22,160
What? Have I been well? What a joke.

384
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:26,510
I've gone through hell for several years because of you.

385
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:31,520
To be honest, I lost my memory in the accident.

386
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,390
My gosh, I heard about it.

387
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:37,210
I'm so glad you lived though.

388
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:42,440
If you died, I would have been the culprit.

389
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,600
Pardon?

390
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:55,680
Anyway, I heard you and you switched positions since then.

391
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,520
Who should I ask to work with, Team 1?

392
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,240
Team Leader Kang's?

393
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:05,600
- Or Team Leader Do's? 
 - Chief, of course, you should come to us—

394
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,000
You should work with both teams and have us compete in a presentation.

395
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:18,920


396
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,430
   

397
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:29,280
♫  I'm breaking rocks  ♫

398
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:36,900
♫  I'll see everything to the end  ♫

399
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,760
♫  And I'm breaking rocks  ♫

400
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,280
♫  I'm breaking rocks  ♫

401
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:50,290
♫  Step by step, higher  ♫

402
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:52,970
♫  I don't care what you think  ♫

403
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,570
♫  I'll rock it in my style  ♫

404
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:01,120
♫  Just like a wrecking ball  ♫

405
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,870
♫  Fly freely  ♫

406
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:08,640
♫  Just go ahead and fire it up, break all the way  ♫
