00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:12,338
"Guardian?"

5
00:00:15,378 --> 00:00:17,177
Who says you're her guardian?

6
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:18,448
Me.

7
00:00:20,678 --> 00:00:22,419
- I'm her boyfriend. - Hey.

8
00:00:25,819 --> 00:00:28,459
If you act like you're Na Eon's boyfriend one more time,

9
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:31,227
I'll make you pay for it.

10
00:00:31,228 --> 00:00:32,389
Look who's talking.

11
00:00:35,959 --> 00:00:37,529
Why didn't you do anything...

12
00:00:38,468 --> 00:00:41,569
until Na Eon ended up like that and even lost her position?

13
00:00:44,438 --> 00:00:45,538
Did you...

14
00:00:46,409 --> 00:00:48,279
just want to sleep with her?

15
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:51,348
You're one crazy scumbag.

16
00:00:51,349 --> 00:00:52,409
Or...

17
00:00:53,849 --> 00:00:55,548
were you secretly hoping she'd end up like that?

18
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:57,148
You jerk!

19
00:00:59,188 --> 00:01:01,219
I've been suffering more than anyone else.

20
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:05,728
She ended up like that at the pop-up store, which we organized together.

21
00:01:07,629 --> 00:01:09,359
In the water tank I made.

22
00:01:11,198 --> 00:01:12,469
Na Eon...

23
00:01:28,178 --> 00:01:29,617
(Kim Ji Eun, Lomon)

24
00:01:29,618 --> 00:01:30,749

(Branding in Seongsu)

26
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,477
Cha Jung Woo.

27
00:01:55,478 --> 00:01:56,478
(Cha Jung Woo, Seongsu Agency's art director)

28
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,608
Based on the wound on his hand, it's not impossible.

29
00:01:59,609 --> 00:02:01,178
(Wound on hand, joined SSA together 8 years ago, no alibi)

30
00:02:02,148 --> 00:02:03,719
But he doesn't really have a motive.

31
00:02:05,849 --> 00:02:07,988
The most likely suspect is actually...

32
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:10,558
(Clear motive)

33
00:02:10,559 --> 00:02:13,357
The one who'd benefit the most from my absence.

34
00:02:13,358 --> 00:02:14,998
(New manager of Team 1, Do Yoo Mi)

35
00:02:14,999 --> 00:02:16,258
Do Yoo Mi.

36
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,297
But she couldn't have possibly done it alone.

37
00:02:20,298 --> 00:02:22,098
(It's impossible to do such a thing alone.)

38
00:02:22,099 --> 00:02:23,909
If someone helped her...

39
00:02:25,369 --> 00:02:26,638
Mr. Nam?

40
00:02:27,578 --> 00:02:28,607
(Coward)

41
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:30,349
That jerk is too much of a sissy.

42
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:34,319
Director Han?

43
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:39,189
But he'd never get his own hands dirty.

44
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:41,818
(Cha Jung Woo, Do Yoo Mi, Mr. Nam, Director Han)

45
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,428
I don't have enough clues to find the killer.

46
00:02:44,429 --> 00:02:45,728
(The killer, not enough clues)

47
00:02:46,488 --> 00:02:48,428
(Recents, 911)

48
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:50,098
Then who called it in?

49
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:52,529
(Outgoing call, 11:05pm)

50
00:02:54,399 --> 00:02:56,338
On the scene at the time of the incident.

51
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:57,838
(The caller was at the scene.)

52
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:59,569
Who else was there?

53
00:03:14,258 --> 00:03:16,488
(I Will Not Speak)

54
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:24,599
Are you working on the supplementary materials for the presentation?

55
00:03:25,029 --> 00:03:27,297
(I Will Not Speak)

56
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:28,538
(I Will Not Speak)

57
00:03:29,738 --> 00:03:31,569
Even if you're mad at me for what happened yesterday,

58
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:34,108
I will not apologize.

59
00:03:34,779 --> 00:03:38,478
(I Will Not Speak)

60
00:03:40,518 --> 00:03:41,719
Suit yourselves.

61
00:03:43,988 --> 00:03:45,349
Wait, Eun Ho.

62
00:03:45,649 --> 00:03:48,918
You do owe us an apology for saying such mean things.

63
00:03:48,988 --> 00:03:50,257
Yes, you do.

64
00:03:50,258 --> 00:03:52,659
Lex was so hurt.

65
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,858
I thought you were giving me the silent treatment.

66
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,529
It hasn't even been ten minutes since you arrived at the office.

67
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:00,498
Look at this.

68
00:04:00,499 --> 00:04:03,339
You always have to make such mean remarks that hurt others.

69
00:04:03,508 --> 00:04:06,408
Yes. You always say such hurtful things.

70
00:04:06,409 --> 00:04:09,038
It made Lex lose his temper in that moment, so he let it all out.

71
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:17,148
Then you'll all feel more comfortable without me around.

72
00:04:18,648 --> 00:04:20,088
Are you really going to be like this?

73
00:04:21,619 --> 00:04:22,888
Eun Ho, where are you going?

74
00:04:41,679 --> 00:04:42,679
(Do Not Cross, Under Investigation)

75
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:16,778
He suddenly showed up from over there.

76
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:22,578
I ran up the stairs to run away from him and...

77
00:05:25,148 --> 00:05:26,249
My phone.

78
00:05:56,679 --> 00:05:57,919
This stain is...

79
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:06,129
It was on the shoemaker's knife too.

80
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:12,968
If this is the fluorescent material used at the pop-up store...

81
00:06:18,239 --> 00:06:19,338
No way.

82
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:41,958
The same fluorescent material...

83
00:06:43,598 --> 00:06:45,429
was on the shoemaker's knife too?

84
00:07:00,578 --> 00:07:02,148
The owner of this knife...

85
00:07:11,059 --> 00:07:13,999
was there,

86
00:07:15,129 --> 00:07:16,258
that night.

87
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,308
UX, those jerks!

88
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:32,879
Hey, are you drunk?

89
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:34,749
- It's XU, not UX. - Shut it.

90
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:36,248
That's enough, you guys.

91
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:37,788
Hey, come on!

92
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:40,859
You see, had we agreed to hand it over sooner...

93
00:07:40,989 --> 00:07:42,587
when others were approaching us with offers,

94
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:44,929
we would've at least gotten paid properly.

95
00:07:45,888 --> 00:07:46,958
That's right!

96
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,658
Are we going to make shoes until the day we die?

97
00:07:50,768 --> 00:07:52,169
No one wears them anyway.

98
00:07:57,569 --> 00:07:58,869
Darn it.

99
00:08:00,778 --> 00:08:01,979
Hey, where are you going?

100
00:08:02,138 --> 00:08:05,179
Wait! I can't add more things to your tab.

101
00:08:08,419 --> 00:08:09,848
Here we go again.

102
00:08:10,018 --> 00:08:11,119
I'll take care of his bill.

103
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:22,197
(Do not force us out!)

104
00:08:22,198 --> 00:08:24,129
(XU must immediately scrap their plan to evict us!)

105
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,708
"I tried to kill Kang Na Eon."

106
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:34,009
Are you bothering me because you want to hear me say that?

107
00:08:34,608 --> 00:08:37,009
That you tried to kill her? I'm not sure about that.

108
00:09:12,348 --> 00:09:14,319
"I was there that night."

109
00:09:16,248 --> 00:09:17,919
I came to hear you say this.

110
00:09:21,819 --> 00:09:22,958
Kang Na Eon.

111
00:09:28,098 --> 00:09:29,429
Weren't you the one who called it in?

112
00:09:35,998 --> 00:09:37,639
Here's my guess.

113
00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:42,179
- On the night of the accident, - Darn it.

114
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:44,809
There were two people at the scene.

115
00:09:46,578 --> 00:09:47,679
The person who called it in...

116
00:09:48,478 --> 00:09:49,618
and the killer.

117
00:10:07,539 --> 00:10:10,838
That night, you found Kang Na Eon at the scene by coincidence.

118
00:10:17,608 --> 00:10:18,679
Shoot.

119
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,759
With the shoemaker's knife you had,

120
00:10:34,828 --> 00:10:35,858
you...

121
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:38,968
saved her.

122
00:10:54,848 --> 00:10:56,049
Hello, 911. What's your emergency?

123
00:10:56,248 --> 00:10:58,019
Hello, I just found someone here...

124
00:11:02,858 --> 00:11:04,828
You hated her to the point that you wanted to kill her.

125
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:07,698
She would've died had you not stepped in.

126
00:11:09,059 --> 00:11:10,228
Why did you save her?

127
00:11:11,698 --> 00:11:12,828
Were you afraid?

128
00:11:22,478 --> 00:11:23,809
Why did I save her?

129
00:11:26,978 --> 00:11:29,748
She was on the verge of death. Do you need another reason?

130
00:11:32,948 --> 00:11:34,059
Kang Na Eon.

131
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:38,659
Yes, she is our sworn enemy.

132
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,228
Of course, I wanted to kill her.

133
00:11:42,458 --> 00:11:44,299
I hated her so much that I wanted to kill her.

134
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,128
But even so...

135
00:11:48,498 --> 00:11:50,838
I can't actually kill someone because I hate them.

136
00:12:02,319 --> 00:12:03,618
And looking back now,

137
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:06,218
she was right about everything.

138
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:09,259
A person died,

139
00:12:09,889 --> 00:12:11,858
the landlord is going bonkers,

140
00:12:13,488 --> 00:12:15,328
and the employees have all quit.

141
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,698
Darn it.

142
00:12:18,498 --> 00:12:20,598
I should've quit this fight long ago.

143
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:26,468
I just didn't want to admit it.

144
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:30,309
The fact that...

145
00:12:34,419 --> 00:12:36,049
no one cares about handmade shoes anymore.

146
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,929
Don't ignore my messages.

147
00:12:53,569 --> 00:12:54,638
I mean...

148
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,799
A female deity's soul in a man's body?

149
00:12:57,868 --> 00:13:00,909
Drag shows are my hobby.

150
00:13:01,878 --> 00:13:03,679
Do you think you're on the HR team or what?

151
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:06,448
Don't you know that you can't fire people for having a second job?

152
00:13:13,889 --> 00:13:15,358
"A female deity's soul..."

153
00:13:16,218 --> 00:13:17,659
"in a man's body?"

154
00:13:19,689 --> 00:13:21,059
Let's give it a twist.

155
00:13:23,998 --> 00:13:24,998
What?

156
00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:26,628
You don't have to...

157
00:13:27,238 --> 00:13:29,299
be loved by everyone.

158
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,278
(Don't you know that you can't fire people for having a second job?)

159
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,978
He's ignoring my messages again when he's read them.

160
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,618
I should just quit my other job.

161
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:47,988
You lie with every breath you draw, so I don't believe you.

162
00:13:50,458 --> 00:13:52,357
Why don't they make high heels in size 280?

163
00:13:52,358 --> 00:13:54,259
Gosh, my poor babies.

164
00:13:56,899 --> 00:13:57,899
Hey, honey.

165
00:13:58,498 --> 00:14:02,639
All the drag clubs in Itaewon are shutting down these days.

166
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:04,568
If this was your only job, you'd starve!

167
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:05,909
I'd rather starve.

168
00:14:07,409 --> 00:14:09,108
I don't feel confident that I can thrive at work.

169
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:11,809
Honey.

170
00:14:17,448 --> 00:14:20,819
Oh, my goodness. A super hot guy is here today!

171
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:23,259
My gosh, where? Let's check him out together.

172
00:14:56,419 --> 00:14:57,559
Are you allowed to drink...

173
00:14:58,228 --> 00:14:59,588
before your show?

174
00:15:03,098 --> 00:15:05,728
My gosh! Look how flirty he is.

175
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:07,368
If you're here to apologize, get lost.

176
00:15:08,439 --> 00:15:09,838
I won't accept your apology.

177
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:15,838
I won't apologize, but I brought you a gift.

178
00:15:17,478 --> 00:15:18,478
Princess.

179
00:15:19,348 --> 00:15:20,478
What's your shoe size?

180
00:15:27,218 --> 00:15:28,957
Yes, go on in.

181
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,087
Please wait just a bit longer.

182
00:15:30,088 --> 00:15:31,388
Hello.
