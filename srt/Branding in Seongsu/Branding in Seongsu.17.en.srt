HQ Motors.

7
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,650
Are you okay?

8
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,290
"Motors?"

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,658
The HQ Motors project.

10
00:00:21,659 --> 00:00:23,459
Make it cancelled. That's my condition.

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,330
HQ Motors.

12
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:32,840
I will not do it.

13
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,499
- What? - What?

19
00:01:31,389 --> 00:01:32,400
What?

20
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,170
You got me so surprised!

21
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,999
Why are you standing there like that?

22
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,239
What happened with HQ Motors?

23
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,738
Why didn't you answer my calls?

24
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:45,209
Come on. I also got so surprised...

25
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,680
because we switched again.

26
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,049
What?

27
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,519
You're scaring me.

28
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,988
Why are you acting like this?

29
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:00,290
What were the messages with Director Han?

30
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:04,030
I can tell you what I know...

31
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,530
under conditions.

32
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,530
Oh, come on.

33
00:02:07,729 --> 00:02:10,300
I'm just doing as I'm told to go under Director Han.

34
00:02:10,999 --> 00:02:12,140
What did he tell you to do?

35
00:02:12,699 --> 00:02:14,399
I have to know to get it done.

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,668
I don't know yet.

37
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:18,978
He's such a snake.

38
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:20,680
He keeps stalling.

39
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:24,949
I'll get going then.

40
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,390
Gosh, what's wrong with you? You must be crazy!

41
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,789
Just think that you're kissing the mirror.

42
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:38,559
I've ended up looking like this at an important moment.

43
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,860
I have to get back to myself.

44
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,430
Na Eon.

45
00:02:41,669 --> 00:02:43,800
Are you really thinking that kissing is the method to get back?

46
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:47,168
Come on. You're not an intuitive type of person.

47
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:48,639
You're a sensor!

48
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,269
- Give me that mouth. - No!

49
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:54,009
You sound like an old creep. What's wrong with you?

50
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:56,249
No way.

51
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:59,650
Don't tell me you've kissed me when I was asleep last night.

52
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,590
Are you out of your mind?

53
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:04,490
Gosh. I'm telling you kissing is not the right method.

54
00:03:04,719 --> 00:03:05,860
Don't get near me!

55
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,589
What's wrong with you?

56
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,689
So Eun Ho.

57
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:18,129
Focus...

58
00:03:19,439 --> 00:03:20,539
on me.

59
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,438
What? What's with those cheap lines?

60
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:26,640
Don't get near me!

61
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,180
Gosh!

62
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:30,949
I'm a guy too.

63
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:40,319
I told you!

64
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:42,229
I told you it wasn't the method!

65
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,860
I know that a simple peck on the lips won't work.

66
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:51,129
Kiss me like you mean it.

67
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,840
Put on an act that you love me.

68
00:03:55,509 --> 00:03:57,310
Do you think that would work as an act?

69
00:03:59,379 --> 00:04:01,009
- Not even once? - What?

70
00:04:01,509 --> 00:04:02,909
Was there never a moment...

71
00:04:04,979 --> 00:04:06,219
you loved me?

72
00:04:30,369 --> 00:04:31,739
What are you two doing?

73
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,010
Gosh. What are you doing?

74
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:36,548
Jung Woo! Goodness.

75
00:04:36,549 --> 00:04:37,780
My gosh.

76
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,219
I told you to stop!

77
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:13,179
What?

78
00:05:14,679 --> 00:05:16,119
We switched again?

79
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:28,729
What's up with him?

80
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,530
So Eun Ho. Let's talk.

81
00:05:32,469 --> 00:05:34,840
Talk here where I'm around.

82
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:39,710
You never know what that creep will do to you.

83
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:41,580
I'm sorry,

84
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,179
but the creep is that one.

85
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,080
Fine. Let's talk here.

86
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,049
What if our bodies switch all of a sudden again?

87
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,559
- Bodies switch? - That's making me go crazy too.

88
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,829
Gosh, what happened this time?

89
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,699
What are you two talking about?

90
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:00,760
So Eun Ho.

91
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:03,399
Turn on voice recording for the time being.

92
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,669
I'll do the same.

93
00:06:05,169 --> 00:06:06,339
All day?

94
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,869
That's how we can prepare for something unexpected.

95
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,539
That sounds great. Let's do that then.

96
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,609
Guys, I'm here too.

97
00:06:16,349 --> 00:06:17,679
What did you do with my underwear?

98
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,150
Oh, that.

99
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,649
I washed it and hung it up next to the dryer.

100
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,719
Shall I get it for you?

101
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,119
It's okay. I'll get it myself.

102
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,659
Okay.

103
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:31,530
Why would you take care of her underwear?

104
00:06:34,859 --> 00:06:37,369
Na Eon, I'll get you new underwear.

105
00:06:37,469 --> 00:06:39,499
Don't wear anything this guy has touched.

106
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,599
Just tear it all up!

107
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,409
- Wait for me! - Na Eon!

108
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:53,780
Na Eon!

109
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,590
I'll sit next to her.

110
00:07:01,989 --> 00:07:03,659
That's where I belong.

111
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,500
Right, Na Eon?

112

(Business Partnership Agreement)

114
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:40,460
You've been managing HQ Motors for all these years?

115
00:07:46,469 --> 00:07:48,298
Ms. Kang. As you've asked,

116
00:07:48,299 --> 00:07:50,270
I've been following around Director Han.

117
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,039
Is taking photos in secret...

118
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,210
part of your job?

119
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:59,179
Well...

120
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:02,150
Mr. Nam asked me to do it...

121
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:04,890
at the Mood party.

122
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,419
Is that so?

123
00:08:08,989 --> 00:08:10,359
I'm a team manager too.

124
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:13,260
Will you do what I ask you to do too?

125
00:08:23,869 --> 00:08:26,640
This is a terrible shot.

126
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,289
Being entertained by the HQ Motors people just like that?

127
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,659
What a jerk.

128
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,699
I'm the publicist of HQ Motors, Jung Sung Hyun.

129
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:55,309
Did you mean what you said last night?

130
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,140
What's this?

131
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,880
(So Eun Ho)

132
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,419
Hey, Na Eon.

133
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,189
Where are you right now? Are you at the office?

134
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,620
I'm at Daesungjang for the project you got me.

135
00:09:13,459 --> 00:09:16,130
- I'm staying the night for... - What were you up to last night?

136
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:19,730
What was I up to?

137
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,030
Last night.

138
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:23,199
With HQ Motors...

139
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:56,669
(Motel Daesungjang)

140
00:10:04,169 --> 00:10:05,240
What?

141
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,510
Have we switched again?

142
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,549
Why do we keep switching? I'm about to go insane.

143
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:15,490
So Eun Ho.

144
00:10:16,049 --> 00:10:19,259
What did you tell HQ Motors last night?

145
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,859
Well,

146
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,490
they wanted a deal with Segye Group, so I agreed.

147
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:25,899
- What? - Gosh.

148
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,859
I'm so exhausted.

149
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,869
Gosh. Hey, baby.

150
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,099
- The CEO is calling me. - Did you wait for a long time?

151
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,538
- I'll call you back later. - I'm sorry for being late.

152
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:33,869
I had to chase after my child...

153
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,269
that didn't want to come home.

154
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,370
This is driving me crazy.

155
00:10:39,409 --> 00:10:40,838
I have something important to take care of.

156
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:42,709
I'm afraid I can't stay tonight.

157
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,909
I'll be off.

158
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,780
Come on. Are you trying to run off on your own?

159
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:51,589
Come on. You can never do that.

160
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,159
Never.

161
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:01,360
(Daesungjang)

162
00:11:01,459 --> 00:11:03,400
Shall we try lowering it to the cheapest price?

163
00:11:04,069 --> 00:11:07,100
It's already on a super sale.

164
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:09,870
It has been over ten years since that has happened.

165
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,338
Was the price the issue in the first place?

166
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,678
No one would want to pay to come here.

167
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:17,809
Gosh! It's not like we can target people having an affair.

168
00:11:18,949 --> 00:11:21,120
I'm in great need for a caffeine boost.

169
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,789
Anyone down for coffee?

170
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,020
One!

171
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,658
- Two! - Three!

172
00:11:27,659 --> 00:11:28,720
- Yes. - Yes.

173
00:11:28,829 --> 00:11:30,359
Okay. I'll go.

174
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,959
- Not the high school student. - Gosh.

175
00:11:32,329 --> 00:11:34,298
You'll run away while pretending to get our coffee.

176
00:11:34,299 --> 00:11:35,569
Right. You can't go.

177
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,199
- Gosh. That got me! - That surprised me!

178
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,299
What's wrong with the weather now?

179
00:11:43,669 --> 00:11:47,679
It must be a sign from the skies that we must stay the night.

180
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:49,880
- Gosh. - Gosh.

181
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:53,480
- Do you want to get killed? - Shall we have some of that?

182
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,439
Young Ae's coffee. Give it a try!

183
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:19,110
This is better than a dolce latte.

184
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,678
What are you doing?

185
00:12:20,679 --> 00:12:22,279
Why aren't you running a café?

186
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,479
This feels so retro. Oh, my.

187
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,120
- It tastes good. - If this is what we're here for,

188
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,549
I'll really get going.

189
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:31,350
Why?

190
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:34,318
But this is so good. You should try some.

191
00:12:34,319 --> 00:12:36,189
Why are you acting like that? Eun Ho!

192
00:12:37,459 --> 00:12:39,730
- Gosh! - What's going on now?

193
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,100
This is scaring me.

194
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:55,880
It was fine when I was in Eun Ho's body.

195
00:12:56,449 --> 00:12:57,549
What's going on?

196
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,319
It seems like a blackout.

197
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,890
- Eun Ho? - Honey?

198
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:13,130
- Eun Ho! - Gosh!

199
00:13:13,929 --> 00:13:16,198
Are you okay, Eun Ho?

200
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:18,499
- Are you okay? - What's going on?

201
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,569
Get him up.

202
00:13:20,539 --> 00:13:21,600
Be careful.

203
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:23,568
Shouldn't we take him to the hospital?

204
00:13:23,569 --> 00:13:24,839
Right.

205
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:30,909
Didn't you just hear something strange?

206
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:32,549
Hear what?

207
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:55,839
Hurry!

208
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:58,240
- Stay still! - I want to go first!

209
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:14,520
Is it you again?

210
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,260
Sorry about yesterday.

211
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:24,168
I've mistreated the ones...

212
00:14:24,169 --> 00:14:25,870
who came to help, haven't I?

213
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,668
I do agree a bit with the...

214
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:30,609
- Come on! - What's wrong with her?

215
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,870
That can happen.

216
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,079
Han Byul isn't a bad girl.

217
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,980
She changed after her mother left.

218
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:44,589
I understand.

219
00:14:51,929 --> 00:14:54,260
It has been a while for me too to be without family.

220
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,870
My goodness.

221
00:14:57,569 --> 00:14:59,669
You must've been through a lot.

222
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,569
You parents must be proud of you for becoming a great person.

223
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,010
Not really.

224
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:09,949
I haven't really changed from those times.

225
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:12,819
They might be rather disappointed.

226
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:16,289
Not at all. They will be proud of you.

227
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,649
Feeling that you haven't changed...

228
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,860
means that you have been trying to protect yourself.

229
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:24,760
It's the same for me.

230
00:15:25,289 --> 00:15:28,400
I just want to protect the moments that have happened here.

231
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,470
That's all I want.

232
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,459
Is this really necessary?

233
00:15:53,189 --> 00:15:56,059
You get better sleep when you're together.

234
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,990
Right, honey.

235
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,260
I'll protect you.

236
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:03,129
Lex seems like the biggest threat.

237
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,970
- We're all family anyway. - Right.

238
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:11,069
Family?

239
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:17,010
I have no time for this.

You have to take this with you.

You're just staying the night for free.

Hey, granddaughter.

247
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:06,899
I'll keep it short before we check out.

248
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,200
We will...

249
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,770
not change anything.

250
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,270
- What? - What?

251
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,568
Is closing down the only answer?

252
00:17:18,569 --> 00:17:19,609
No.

253
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,280
Let's be honest.

254
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,680
You didn't want this place to go through branding.

The old clock.

256
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:40,760
Han Byul. Let's check your height. Let's do it here.

257
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,899
There you go.

258
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,598
I got taller, right, Grandma?

259
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,710
Yes. You grew this much.

260
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,539
Yes! I grew taller!

261
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,210
The scribbles.

262
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,108
You draw so well.

263
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:58,579
Where am I?

264
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,780
Is that me?

265
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:05,319
Gosh. You're smiling too, Han Byul.

266
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,420
- This is Mom. - Right.

Gosh. There you go.

00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,829
You're amazing.

Have a great day at school.

- I'll be off to school. - Okay.

276
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,599
Go back in, Grandma. Why are you watching me leave?

277
00:18:47,859 --> 00:18:48,930
I'll be back.

278
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,210
They're all the memories you had with Han Byul...

279
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,280
that you don't want to forget.

280
00:19:05,149 --> 00:19:07,920
Daesungjang. Even its name means "Big Star."

281
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:12,420
We can all tell how she feels by the meaning of their names.

282
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:18,829
Staying the same is wanting to protect it.

283
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:21,799
We want to protect...

284
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,530
Daesungjang's time.

285
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:27,299
It's too dark.

But promise us this.

299
00:20:06,309 --> 00:20:08,710
Promise us that you won't ever take in...

300
00:20:09,649 --> 00:20:11,010
people in an affair or minors.

301
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:14,180
We never had people in an affair.
