1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,730
   

2
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:16,800


3
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,630
The handmade shoe factory case.

4
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:23,790
The last pop-up.

5
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:28,360
And Actor Nam is being canceled. Behind all that...

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,170
it was his doing.

7
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,790
So Eun Ho.

8
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,660
 Where are you going? 

9
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,770
 The man who was behind Do Yu Mi. 

10
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:10,050
 He must have found out I did everything, including the Nam Yun Hyeok scandal. 

11
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,220
 Is that who just sent you that message? 

12
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,740
 He found out everything, but he still reached out. That means... 

13
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,060
 It means he wants So Eun Ho. 

14
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,380
   

15
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,020
Sunbae?

16
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,260
Why is he suddenly ringing the doorbell?

17
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,310
Hold on a second.

18
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,240
Hey, Na Eon!

19
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,120
Kang Na Eon!

20
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:18,220
   

21
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,900
   

22
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,660
   

23
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,130
   

24
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:24,440
   

25
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:42,530
   

26
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,240
What's this?

27
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,820
I'm not sure.

28
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,830
Me?

29
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,270
Hey.

30
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,460
So Eun Ho.

31
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,700
Hey, So Eun Ho!

32
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,680
Gosh, I thought my head split open.

33
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:32,690
What? What's this? Huh?

34
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,250
What do you mean?

35
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,130
What's wrong with you?

36
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,560
Well, hold on.

37
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,510
Where am I?

38
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,110
Huh?

39
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,250
You look very familiar.

40
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,000
What?

41
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,620
What?

42
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:05,840
Huh?

43
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,570
So Eun Ho...

44
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:28,880
is back!

45
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:35,780
Hey, Kang Na Eon. Are you okay?

46
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,480
Cha Jeong Wu?

47
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,150
Why are you here?

48
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:55,760
Well, I was just worried about you.

49
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,040
Not you. Me.

50
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,660
What?

51
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,760
I'm back.

52
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,570
I'm back.

53
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,720
So Eun Ho is back.

54
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,280
Gosh, this handsome face.

55
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,570
And this sexy body.

56
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:21,800
It's all back.

57
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:25,560
What? Are you crazy?

58
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,290
Why are you suddenly showing off in front of the Director?

59
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:37,010
Well, where am I, by the way—

60
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:39,850
Didn't you knowingly come here on your own?

61
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:43,720
 He found out everything, but he still reached out. 

62
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,140
 It means he wants So Eun Ho. 

63
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,790
Right...

64
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,470
By chance...

65
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,850
is he the one who wanted me...

66
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:12,660
What's this?

67
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,410
Did we switch back?

68
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,210
- Shit. 
 - Wow.

69
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,730
I don't think you can be left alone.

70
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:30,100
- Why don't you stay with me for now— 
 - That's enough.

71
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,690
You're still acting nosy.

72
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,920
But So Eun Ho's allowed to?

73
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,640
- He and I— 
 - Don't try to tell me you two are dating.

74
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,120
I've never believed that, even once.

75
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,890
I don't know what he has on you,

76
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,610
but I can't leave you two alone.

77
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:09,300
   

78
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,850
Why did he suddenly become stupid?

79
00:08:21,850 --> 00:08:25,220
By the way, what's your relationship with Yu Mi Sunbae?

80
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,120
Hey, that's—

81
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,730
Is he pretending to be stupid?

82
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,040
He's trying to get what he wants by making us lower our guards.

83
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:39,790
I need someone like that.

84
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:44,950
You need a crazy dog to catch a beast.

85
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,700
I'm not crazy though.

86
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:17,230
Let's stop working and eat first.

87
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,650
Cha Jeong Woo,

88
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:23,010
you said you'd help me, right?

89
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,810
Yes. With anything.

90
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:29,990
Find out where So Eun Ho is immediately, then.

91
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:36,340
Why do you want to know where he is?

92
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:39,540
So Eun Ho?

93
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,130
- Sunbae! 
 - Hey.

94
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:42,990
- Sunbae! 
 - Why didn't you answer your phone—

95
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:47,140
Our curse was finally lifted!

96
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,380
Well...

97
00:09:59,620 --> 00:10:01,830
Cha Jeong Woo Sunbae?

98
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:06,360
Did I interrupt something? Huh?

99
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,520
You are interrupting.

100
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,550
Very much.

101
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:14,400
What the heck?

102
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,940
Are you living together already?

103
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,030
As soon as we switched back?

104
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,520
Are you serious...

105
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:26,690
- You little. 
 - You little.

106
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,250
You little.

107
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,520
How dare you do this to your Sunbae?

108
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,770
Enough is enough.

109
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:35,080
Let go. Let go!

110
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,890
Follow me.

111
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,230
- Who? 
 - You, So Eun Ho. Follow me.

112
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,320
Gosh, Sunbae.

113
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,150
What where you trying to do in the room? Hold on.

114
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,930
H-Hey...

115
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:50,700
Hey!

116
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,680
Gosh, Sunbae. What were you trying to do in the room—

117
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,720
What did you do?

118
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,650
How did our bodies switch back?

119
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:02,680
Well, I'd like to know that too.

120
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,640
How about you? Did you do anything before we switched?

121
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,610
No.

122
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,020
Gosh, then why did we switch? It was my chance.

123
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,090
So, what did Director Han say?

124
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:20,280
Tell me everything without omitting a word.

125
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,290
You're asking too much, Sunbae.

126
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:31,230
My GPA was 2.8.

127
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,740
You 2.8 bastard.

128
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,550
How could you?

129
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:42,330
But I'm sure you still need me.

130
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:47,020
Director Han told me to join his side.

131
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,700
So?

132
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,330
I really didn't want to get involved,

133
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,410
but I thought of you.

134
00:11:58,110 --> 00:12:00,380
So, I said I will, no matter what.

135
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,080
Good job.

136
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,760
Why are you hitting me, then?

137
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,040
If Director Han was actually involved,

138
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,570
there must still be evidence that he tried to kill me somewhere.

139
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:21,030
Because he's not that thorough.

140
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:26,890
What will you do for me if I find the evidence?

141
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:29,310
What would be the benefit of...

142
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:35,110
joining your side?

143
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:39,720
Will you stop playing house with Jeong Woo sunbae?

144
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:40,900
Do you like me?

145
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,400
M-Me?

146
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,110
Oh, you do.

147
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,610
You started it with that peck.

148
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:55,420
Well, that was out of comradery or something.

149
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:59,940
And you're the one who kissed me first.

150
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,680
Hold on.

151
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,740
Was that kiss just now...

152
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,640
I think I finally got it.

153
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,080
W-What are you doing?

154
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:28,340
- Come here. 
 - What are you doing?

155
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:32,040
It's easier to approach Director Han with your body.

156
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,290
I also prefer...

157
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,370
my body, okay?

158
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:41,540
Handsome face. Hot body.

159
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,090
I don't want to lose it again.

160
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,120
Shit, that bastard. He's no help.

161
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,890
 Director Han was the one behind Do Yu Mi? 

162
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:05,010
 If so... 

163
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:14,130
That's my spot.

164
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:18,230
Whoever takes it first gets it.

165
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,540
I moved in here first, okay?

166
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:27,040
So Eun Ho, I think you forgot.

167
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,490
I'm your senior.

168
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,270
So what!

169
00:14:32,270 --> 00:14:34,110
So what?

170
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:43,310
- Get out. 
 - If you like this spot so much,

171
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:46,020
why don't you sleep here with me?

172
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,550
What? I thought you were into Kang Na Eon. Are you more like Rex?

173
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,230
Oppa.

174
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,980
I'll sleep with Na Eon, then.

175
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,170
Gosh, Oppa.

176
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:00,110
- Hey, Na Eon. 
 - Where are you going?

177
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:02,590
Your bed isn't there, Oppa.

178
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,410
- It's here! 
 - Hey!

179
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,270
How dare you touch me there? Hey!

180
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:09,130
How dare you touch me there?

181
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:25,930
 If Director Han instigated the murder attempt... 

182
00:15:34,110 --> 00:15:37,210
 Was he the one who was behind that case 

183
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:40,010
 five years ago on top of... 

184
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,800
 trying to kill me? 

185
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,050
 Was it all you? 

186
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:51,150
   

187
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,020
 I'll start presenting the... 

188
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,410
 branding for Segye International's scented candle brand. 

189
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:02,260
 I love this idea so much. 

190
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,580
 The problem is our signature scents. 

191
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:11,410
 We need to figure out where to get them. 

192
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,790
 Find a scent just for Charman Candle by the next board meeting. 

193
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,540
   

194
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,860
   

195
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:23,760
 Who copied whom? 

196
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,410
 Was it us or them? 

197
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,810
 Did you really not know about Bandi Incense? 

198
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,920
 What kind of question is that to ask? 

199
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,430
 The marketing HQ will have to take responsibility for this. 

200
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,990
 Chief Director, 

201
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:40,310
 I heard Marketing Team 1 was in charge of the 

202
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:42,940
 controversial branding for Charman Candle. Is that correct? 

203
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:49,190
 I'm responsible for the entire thing since I'm the chief marketing director. 

204
00:16:49,190 --> 00:16:55,960
 Segye Group has decided to scrap the candle brand. 

205
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,680
 If you keep acting like you're all that, 

206
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:02,850
 it's only a matter of time before you lose all your limbs and are left in the dust. 

207
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,610
 Just like the Director next to you. 

208
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,620
   

209
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,530
 Try taking this all the way. 

210
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:23,540
 If you were indeed behind all this, 

211
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,750
 I'll make sure to... 

212
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,080
 reveal everything. 

213
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,800
Open the door.

214
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,240
I know you're in there.

215
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:15,130
Aren't you being too loud?

216
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:17,390
Why don't you answer my calls?

217
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:20,650
What happened with Kang Na Eon and So Eun Ho?

218
00:18:20,650 --> 00:18:23,690
Stop being delusional. I'm busy.

219
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,840
Did I get abandoned just now?

220
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,410
Why don't you try to be more friendly then?

221
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:40,020
You should have come when I called you and left when I dismissed you.

222
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:44,370
You play hard to get, but you're bad at your job too. What can I do?

223
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:47,360
If you don't want to join the Underdog Team,

224
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,470
I could find a different company for you.

225
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:55,210
What if I won't back down right now?

226
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:03,500
You wanted to see me, Director.

227
00:19:04,150 --> 00:19:06,280
Get her out of here.

228
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,930
Let go!

229
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,290
I can't leave like this.

230
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:15,280
I'll reveal all the dirty things you did.

231
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,850
Let's not embarrass ourselves.

232
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:18,960
Director Han, that bastard—

233
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,930
My...

234
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:26,510
dearest director in the world.

235
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,730
He had already moved on to someone else.

236
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,700
Like who?

237
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,450
- That woman just now? 
 - No.

238
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,940
So Eun Ho.

239
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,620
- So Eun Ho? 
 - Yeah.

240
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,810
I know. You find it weird too, right?

241
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:45,480
What's so great about him that he'd fulfill all of his conditions—

242
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,870
His conditions?

243
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:49,760
What are they?

244
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:55,430
Come on. Of course, I can't tell you that.

245
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,040
   

246
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,310
 Can souls get swapped by kissing? 

247
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:29,100
   

248
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,830
 Were you at a Chaebol family's house when you woke up? 

249
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:36,460
 Please live the reality, not fiction. 

250
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:46,370
 Kissing seems to be the only way. 

251
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:48,590
 You're fired. 

252
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,990
 We were swapped the first time. 

253
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,790
 Don't you want to go back? 

254
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:03,080
 Let's do it. 

255
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,270
 Let's go ahead and kiss. 

256
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,850
 But it didn't work the second time. 

257
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,210
 I guess I'm also drunk. 

258
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,810
 The third time was... 

259
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:26,030
 By chance... 

260
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,730
 does it have to be intense? 

261
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:39,660
 Whatever. 

262
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,530
Why is it so bright?

263
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,440
Why did you turn the lights off?

264
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,300
Sunbae. Sunbae!

265
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:22,810


266
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:50,110
   

267
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,970
♫  Just call me "Lady", not "someone's so-and-so"  ♫

268
00:23:59,970 --> 00:24:02,050
♫  Don't call me "Of Yours"  ♫

269
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:05,290
♫   I just may achieve my dreams, get up   ♫

270
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:09,480
♫  I'm drive by pain, even in the face of challenge and despair  ♫

271
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,300
♫  There's no need to stress  ♫

272
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,580
♫  That's my blue  ♫

273
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,900
♫  Eyes  ♫

274
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:21,000
♫  What once looked like a hurdle beyond the eyes  ♫

275
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,220
♫  Don't matter to me anymore  ♫

276
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,370
♫  I'll fly high and follow my dreams  ♫

277
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:29,890
♫  I'm already pretty high up  ♫

278
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:32,040
♫  Just call me my name  ♫

279
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,710
♫  I don't ask for much  ♫
