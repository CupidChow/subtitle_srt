00:00:12,108 --> 00:00:13,338
Hello, sir.

6
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:16,239
This is Director Han.

7
00:00:17,108 --> 00:00:18,479
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

8
00:00:18,608 --> 00:00:19,748
- Take a seat. - Right.

9
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:26,918
I heard Segye International and Seongsu Agency...

10
00:00:26,919 --> 00:00:28,088
were up for a big match.

11
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:31,059
Sorry for the family trouble.

12
00:00:31,389 --> 00:00:32,389
Not at all.

13
00:00:32,459 --> 00:00:35,629
It's not like our hydrogen battery technology will go anywhere.

14
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:37,160
I don't think we'll lose anything...

15
00:00:37,529 --> 00:00:39,599
whoever wins.

16
00:00:41,129 --> 00:00:42,699
What happened?

17
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,239
Is it over just like this?

18
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:46,498
If Ms. Kang can't find a way,

19
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:47,609
it's all over.

20
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:50,309
What do we do?

21
00:00:53,609 --> 00:00:54,609
Sweetheart?

22
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:01,650
Where's has the fighting spirit you had for me gone?

23
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,260
You said you wanted a fair fight.

24
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:12,829
How do you have that?

25
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,669
Living with enemies around you...

26
00:01:17,639 --> 00:01:19,240
is harder than it looks.

27
00:01:19,999 --> 00:01:21,809
If you want to reach your goal,

28
00:01:22,809 --> 00:01:24,980
you must use anything you can.

29
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:32,150
Do the presentation with this.

30
00:01:37,189 --> 00:01:38,719
Why are you giving me this?

31
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,130
Because you're Kang Na Eon right now.

32
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,359
It isn't for you.

33
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,359
It's for me.

34
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,369
Director Han said...

35
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:50,499
there's evidence in here that can be used against you.

36
00:01:53,269 --> 00:01:55,669
If I were to get punished for this,

37
00:01:56,809 --> 00:01:57,840
that also...

38
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,909
will be for me.

39
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,969
- High Jet? - It's not HQ Motors.

40
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,730
Why does my sweetheart have this?

41
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,418
(Kim Ji Eun, Lomon)

42
00:02:38,419 --> 00:02:39,579

(Branding in Seongsu)

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,398
Now,

45
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:03,510
we will begin with Seongsu Agency's Manager Kang Na Eon.

46
00:03:05,679 --> 00:03:06,739
Ms. Kang?

47
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,950
Ms. Kang?

48
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,419
Ms. Kang?

49
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,919
I believe something has happened to Manager Kang Na Eon.

50
00:03:17,089 --> 00:03:19,859
- Manager So Eun Ho will go... - That can't happen.

51
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:21,889
Doesn't that make her...

52
00:03:22,929 --> 00:03:24,030
eliminated?

53
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:30,399
I'm sorry.

54
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,970
We ran a little late due to a minor issue.

55
00:03:35,839 --> 00:03:37,510
We will begin with the presentation right away.

56
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,079
Jenny.

57
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:46,950
(High Jet)

58
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,359
(High Jet, Korea's first-ever liquid hydrogen battery developer)

59
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,530
Do you see the company's name of High Jet?

60
00:03:56,889 --> 00:03:57,929
What?

61
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,729
High Jet is a company that has used only Korean technology...

62
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,569
to develop a liquid hydrogen battery used for vehicles...

63
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:05,669
in Korea for the first time.

64
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,939
But why does HQ Motors have the title...

65
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,979
of being the first developer...

66
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,879
of Korea's first-ever liquid hydrogen battery?

67
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,278
Make her stop.

68
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:16,279
- Right. - Right.

69
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,549
- Where do you think you're going? - You can't go in there.

70
00:04:21,550 --> 00:04:23,518
- Gosh! - What are you doing?

71
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:27,620
Our team has visited CEO Choi Chang Joo...

72
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:29,529
to find out about the truth of the first liquid hydrogen battery.

73
00:04:35,899 --> 00:04:38,699
Well, there seem to be some technical difficulties.

74
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,468
We'll pause with the presentation for now.

75
00:04:40,469 --> 00:04:41,570
No. We're fine.

76
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:47,680
This happens quite often during presentations.

77
00:04:48,409 --> 00:04:49,478
But from now on,

78
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:52,450
please focus on what I am about to say.

79
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,149
Since a very young age,

80
00:04:56,719 --> 00:04:59,019
this boy loved cars.

81
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,919
- Here I go. - He was influenced greatly...

82
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,560
by his father who worked at a repair shop.

83
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:06,430
As a proud son of his father,

84
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:09,828
he managed to develop Korea's first liquid hydrogen battery.

85
00:05:09,829 --> 00:05:11,000
It worked!

86
00:05:11,899 --> 00:05:13,839
He was ready to commercialize this technology.

87
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:17,208
However, there was no one who listened to the words...

88
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:19,380
of a disabled small business CEO.

89
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:24,010
In the end, due to the lack of funds and power,

90
00:05:24,579 --> 00:05:27,180
High Jet failed to commercialize this technology...

91
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:29,320
even after developing Korea's first liquid hydrogen battery.

92
00:05:30,089 --> 00:05:31,860
You should stop with this nonsense.

93
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,320
This isn't nonsense.

94
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,689
High Jet?

95
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,529
Do you have the evidence that they developed the battery?

96
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:42,670
Will you all...

97
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:45,269
look toward the entrance?

98
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:59,579
This is High Jet's first-generation liquid hydrogen battery car.

99
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,079
And that is...

100
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:03,950
the first man who made Korea's first liquid hydrogen battery.

101
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,360
It's CEO Choi Chang Joo.

102
00:06:07,089 --> 00:06:09,130
Chang Joo loves cars.

103
00:06:09,729 --> 00:06:13,130
We do not want to use Korea's first liquid hydrogen battery...

104
00:06:13,899 --> 00:06:15,430
for marketing.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,598
The title for being the first can be a meaningless record...

106
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:22,570
that can be taken away just like this.

107
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:25,010
But instead,

108
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:28,479
we want to use CEO Choi Chang Joo's history for marketing.

109
00:06:28,909 --> 00:06:29,909
Are you kidding me?

110
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,879
It's still just a small business with a CEO...

111
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,420
who is mentally challenged.

112
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,588
Someone who can't do anything on their own.

113
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:38,360
We won't leave him on his own.

114
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,560
I'm suggesting HQ Motors...

115
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:47,060
to buy High Jet's history of failure.

116
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:01,310
This is the branding idea I have for HQ Motors.

117
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,019
("HQ Motors Acquires Liquid Hydrogen Battery Company, High Jet")

118
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,849
("HQ Motors and High Jet, Indicator for Big and Small Coexistence")

119
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,120
Although it lacks power and funds,

120
00:07:13,719 --> 00:07:16,360
High Jet has the right technology.

121
00:07:17,159 --> 00:07:20,300
If HQ Motors confidently makes an investment,

122
00:07:20,529 --> 00:07:23,399
this will be a much more meaningful branding item...

123
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:26,800
than millions of commercial ideas.

124
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,570
Sir, this is absolute nonsense.

125
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:32,838
The liquid hydrogen battery was developed by our...

126
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:33,839
Interesting.

127
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:38,450
Whether we developed it or not,

128
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:41,719
I want to buy High Jet's history.

129
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,260
But before that,

130
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:47,620
if we were the ones to steal the technology,

131
00:07:48,389 --> 00:07:50,130
we must find the culprit.

132
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:56,328
Well...

133
00:07:56,329 --> 00:07:58,299
Segye Group is dealing with...

134
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,500
the matters based on the stealing of technology.

135
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:01,839
Do not worry.

136
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:19,560
When I first met CEO Choi Chang Joo,

137
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:22,560
he seemed to know Director Han very well.

138
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,728
If you have just a hydrogen battery just this big,

139
00:08:25,729 --> 00:08:27,329
it can move 100km.

140
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,939
(Director Han Yi Jae)

141
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,270
(Segye Group)

142
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:36,940
I looked into it and found out that Director Han...

143
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:41,140
was the one to snatch the branding request of High Jet...

144
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,579
that came to Seongsu Agency.

145
00:08:45,749 --> 00:08:48,089
Look at this. We can hit it big with this one.

146
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,950
Hey, we might be able to use this.

147
00:08:52,619 --> 00:08:54,588
Sir, that man...

148
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:56,828
used the relationship we had...

149
00:08:56,829 --> 00:08:58,199
to threaten me.

150
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,060
What are you on about?

151
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,098
There was a similar technology,

152
00:09:03,099 --> 00:09:06,440
but there was a leading company. I was telling you to be careful.

153
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:08,910
Don't you know what branding is?

154
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:11,579
You received quite a lot for your branding.

155
00:09:11,979 --> 00:09:12,979
What?

156
00:09:15,479 --> 00:09:17,009
(Mr. Han Yi Jae, bank account, normal deposit)

157
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,050
What are you doing right now?

158
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,489
I'm doing a presentation.

159
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,219
So HQ Motors can become a better brand.

160
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,329
It's called branding.

161
00:09:33,859 --> 00:09:34,969
What are you doing?

162
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,869
You said you were curious...

163
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,509
what face Kang Na Eon would make.

164
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:49,050
I've always had the same face around you.

165
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:53,150
A face of pity.

166
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:56,650
This punk... What do you think you're doing?

167
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,890
All right.

168
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,359
Director Han, let's stop with the fuss here.

169
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:07,900
Segye International is already dealing with this matter.

170
00:10:08,099 --> 00:10:09,469
But it is our issue, after all.

171
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,469
Let's solve this together.

172
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:13,339
Once things get sorted,

173
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:16,070
I will contact again you for the High Jet project.

174
00:10:17,469 --> 00:10:18,479
See you again.

175
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,339
Sir...

176
00:10:34,989 --> 00:10:37,129
You've been through so much until now.

177
00:10:37,859 --> 00:10:39,160
Things will get solved now.

178
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:41,300
Thank you.

179
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,728
It was nice...

180
00:10:42,729 --> 00:10:45,969
that the handsome guy took good care of me.

181
00:10:45,999 --> 00:10:47,070
Eun Ho?

182
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:53,508
Gosh. Sweethearts, let's take him back home.

183
00:10:53,509 --> 00:10:54,949
- Right. - You can stay here.

184
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:55,950
Great.

185
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:57,378
- Let's go. - Let's go.

186
00:10:57,379 --> 00:10:58,379
Are you ready?

187
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:11,629
Shall we talk?

188
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,729
By no means,

189
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:18,670
don't think that you're a good person after this.

190
00:11:20,469 --> 00:11:22,869
Don't think that I have forgiven you as well.

191
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:29,550
You can give my body back.

192
00:11:41,759 --> 00:11:42,859
What are you doing?

193
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,599
You'll find out once tomorrow comes.

194
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:55,509
What are you doing?

195
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,709
Me taking this...

196
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:00,810
is the same as giving it to you.

197
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:40,420
Na Eon. You haven't had dinner, right?

198
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:46,759
Coffee can't be considered as a meal.

199
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:49,560
What will you do without me?

200
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,629
There.

201
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,770
Why aren't you coming?

202
00:12:59,469 --> 00:13:01,440
Right. It's too dark, isn't it?

203
00:13:11,349 --> 00:13:12,420
Come on over.

204
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,579
Let's eat.

205
00:13:58,959 --> 00:13:59,959
Have I...

206
00:14:02,369 --> 00:14:03,400
really returned?

207
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,249
The incident five years ago.

208
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,520
What's the truth?

209
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,219
The truth?

210
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,690
It's simple.

211
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:33,359
The person responsible for everything.

212
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,129
Manager Kang Na Eon.

213
00:15:06,459 --> 00:15:09,700
What makes the Bandi Candle different from others?

214
00:15:10,129 --> 00:15:11,270
It smells great.

215
00:15:12,739 --> 00:15:14,700
Could you be more specific?

216
00:15:15,239 --> 00:15:16,739
It's a business secret.

217
00:15:17,509 --> 00:15:19,639
You're great keeping things a secret.

218
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,640
You're amazing.

219
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:32,419
The Bandi Candle utilizes Korea's traditional scent-making method...

220
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,059
as a candle.

221
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,359
It's a project that aims to create an eco-friendly candle.

222
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:39,858
I've heard the name "Bandi" came from the natural light...

223
00:15:39,859 --> 00:15:42,229
of a firefly. Am I right?

224
00:15:54,979 --> 00:15:56,180
Na Eon?

225
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:02,320
I am currently in Segye Group's Marketing HQ.

226
00:16:02,749 --> 00:16:04,849
I am brand marketer, Kang Na Eon.

227
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,219
I am filming this video to leave the truth...

228
00:16:08,729 --> 00:16:10,089
about the Bandi Candle incident.

229
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:14,060
While working on Segye Group's independent candle brand, Charmant,

230
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,869
and its branding,

231
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,200
I came across the Bandi Candle.

232
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:29,779
I wanted to release Charmant...

233
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,709
through a collaboration project with Bandi Candle.

234
00:16:33,349 --> 00:16:36,249
But while working on the project,

235
00:16:36,989 --> 00:16:39,390
Segye Group removed the existence of Bandi Candle.

236
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:42,628
I clearly explained it was a collaboration.

237
00:16:42,629 --> 00:16:45,499
- But why are they ignoring... - It's their method...

238
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:47,660
of putting the Marketing HQ in trouble.

239
00:16:51,499 --> 00:16:54,099
Don't get shaken by it. Just carry on with it.

240
00:16:54,369 --> 00:16:57,310
If something happens, I will take responsibility.

241
00:16:59,479 --> 00:17:01,479
I was greatly involved in the Charmant project,

242
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,380
but I failed to stop this incident.

243
00:17:05,350 --> 00:17:06,479
I turned a blind eye to it.

244
00:17:17,529 --> 00:17:20,299
I can't do it, Hee Jung.

245
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:29,170
If anyone related to Bandi Candle gets a chance to see this,

246
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:31,269
I know I sound shameless,

247
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:34,979
but I really want to tell you this.

248
00:17:40,319 --> 00:17:42,120
It was a great design...

249
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:44,590
and brand.

250
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,590
I give you my apology once again.

251
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:57,029
(Manager Kang Na Eon)

252
00:17:59,069 --> 00:18:00,539
(On Sae Mi Ro)

253
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:43,950
This.

254
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,049
What is this?

255
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,989
What did you want me to do with this?

256
00:18:57,989 --> 00:18:59,059
Take it...

257
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,600
and tell the world that Kang Na Eon was at fault?

258
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,769
Wasn't that what you wanted?

259
00:19:08,069 --> 00:19:09,069
No.

260
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,979
I...

261
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:16,180
just thought...

262
00:19:17,249 --> 00:19:19,650
a sincere apology would be enough.

263
00:19:20,749 --> 00:19:21,749
But...

264
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,289
if you had already apologized back then,

265
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:29,660
what do I do now?

266
00:19:59,519 --> 00:20:01,219
I really don't know.

267
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,660
I really don't.

268
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,170
So Eun Ho.

269
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,170
So Eun Ho.

270
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:30,488
Segye International's Director Han Yi Jae is under...

271
00:20:30,489 --> 00:20:33,989
an in-house investigation for an extortion of technology.

272
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,929
Based on Director Han Yi Jae's case,

273
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:40,099
many are claiming that a new bill for criminal punishment must be...

274
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,670
established for the tech extortion of big companies against start-ups.

275
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,799
My goodness, Director Han.

276
00:20:47,069 --> 00:20:48,069
No.

277
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,269
You're just Mr. Han Yi Jae now.

278
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:52,009
Leave quietly.

279
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:55,179
HQ Motors has decided to work with High Jet.

280
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:59,749
HQ Motors has apologized for the tech extortion of High Jet.

281
00:20:59,979 --> 00:21:02,318
Through big investments on High Jet,

282
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:04,689
HQ Motors has decided to become the leader of collaborating...

283
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,459
with a smaller business.

284
00:21:06,819 --> 00:21:08,829
According to Segye Group's sources,

285
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,758
a promotion is expected for Manager Kang Na Eon...

286
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:14,700
who has made all of this possible.

287
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,439
(Personnel Appointments)

288
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,039
But why am I tearing up?

289
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,179
We're moving to Team One?

290
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:29,180
(Personnel Appointments)

291
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:33,680
What?

292
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,590
You want us to be in charge of planning a workshop event?

293
00:21:36,789 --> 00:21:39,059
Yes. Is there a problem?

294
00:21:39,719 --> 00:21:40,789
- No! - No!

295
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,528
Good luck,

296
00:21:43,529 --> 00:21:44,959
my senior, Young Ae.

297
00:21:48,729 --> 00:21:50,130
I will do my best!

298
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,100
- I will do my best. - I will do my best.

299
00:21:55,670 --> 00:21:56,670
Right.

300
00:21:58,670 --> 00:22:02,749
All employees must participate.

301
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:05,110
All employees must participate!

302
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,319
- Let's go. - What's wrong with you?

303
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,458
Workshops are so boring.

304
00:22:14,459 --> 00:22:16,590
- Exactly. - And stop.

305
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:20,058
Lex, go to the Art Team...

306
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:21,998
and prepare images for the workshop.

307
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:24,268
Jenny, gather materials from social media...

308
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:26,038
and prepare games for the workshop.

309
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:27,370
And Eun Ho...

310
00:22:29,469 --> 00:22:32,539
Isn't Eun Ho in Team One with us?

311
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,278
Right. But after the HQ Motors presentation,

312
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:37,479
he's nowhere to be seen.

313
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:39,518
Hey, call him right now.

314
00:22:39,519 --> 00:22:41,920
I guess he has something to deal with.

315
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:45,389
You can't just say that and wait.

316
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:47,318
Manager Kang just wanted all employees...

317
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:48,619
to participate in the workshop.

318
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,830
What would happen if Eun Ho doesn't appear?

319
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,529
Does that make us end up in the basement again?

320
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,330
Gosh. Hurry up and call him.

321
00:23:03,069 --> 00:23:05,039
He's not picking up.

322
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,458
You said you were going to send me the evidence. What happened?

323
00:23:23,459 --> 00:23:24,629
(Y2N Hyun Soo)

324
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,360
I'll send you the first draft of the article on Kang Na Eon.

325
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,129
(Breaking: Manager Kang Na Eon of Controversial XU Beauty Incident")

326
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,900
("Real Culprit of Bandi Candle Incident 5 Years Ago")

327
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:45,110
So this is Eun Ho's place?

328
00:23:45,249 --> 00:23:46,518
I think bugs will pop out.

329
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:49,150
It's so far up. I'm so exhausted.

330
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:52,389
- My gosh. - So...

331
00:23:52,390 --> 00:23:53,420
There he is!

332
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,229
Sorry for coming this late.

333
00:23:57,529 --> 00:24:00,599
- We were so disappointed. - That was too much.

334
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,068
People these days get disgusted by just hearing the word "workshop."

335
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:06,468
Of course. All you do is drink.

336
00:24:06,469 --> 00:24:08,899
Goodness. Then shall we make a workshop with no alcohol?

337
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,009
How does that sound?

338
00:24:10,410 --> 00:24:12,239
Are you going to stay here?

339
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,880
Of course.

340
00:24:15,509 --> 00:24:16,509
Please leave.

341
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:19,450
Shall we knock him out?

342
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,818
Or shall we get him drunk...

343
00:24:21,819 --> 00:24:23,420
and make him lose himself?

344
00:24:23,549 --> 00:24:24,818
You should knock him over, Lex.

345
00:24:24,819 --> 00:24:26,059
I told you to leave.

346
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:28,319
He wants us out.

347
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,639
Director Han who has hit rock bottom...

348
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,580
hasn't tried to kill me.

349
00:24:54,719 --> 00:24:55,890
That means he's not the culprit.

350
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:04,229
Then who could it be?

351
00:25:06,430 --> 00:25:09,930
I suffered for years thanks to you.

352
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,769
What a relief you're alive.

353
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:14,299
Sorry?

354
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,340
If you had died,

355
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,479
I would've been the culprit.

356
00:25:21,309 --> 00:25:24,410
Someone who holds grudges against me for the incident of five years ago.

357
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:33,620
And...

358
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,590
the one...

359
00:25:39,529 --> 00:25:40,759
took responsibility for everything.

360
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,869
I clearly explained it was a collaboration.

361
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,369
But why are they ignoring...

362
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:46,370
Na Eon.

363
00:25:48,039 --> 00:25:50,569
Don't get shaken by it. Just carry on with it.

364
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,840
If something happens, I will take responsibility.

365
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:56,508
Are you admitting that you have copied the idea?

366
00:25:56,509 --> 00:25:58,548
Segye Group has never...

367
00:25:58,549 --> 00:26:01,718
stolen a start-up's idea.

368
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:02,789
Hee Jung.

369
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,959
What if these two...

370
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,469
had the same goal?

371
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:36,519
That's nice.

372
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:43,759
Isn't it time for Seongsu Agency...

373
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:47,059
to come back to Segye Group?

374
00:26:47,330 --> 00:26:49,370
We should stop all of this family trouble.

375
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,100
You're right.

376
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:55,839
If we go through a merger, it will greatly increase...

377
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,170
Segye International's stock price.

378
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,580
Speaking of which,

379
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:04,709
I've been thinking about Kang Na Eon. I don't like her much,

380
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:07,219
but she's very hot these days.

381
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,390
How does making her the youngest board member sound?

382
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:15,219
This will get a lot more attention than what you mentioned.

383
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:20,559
Gosh, of course,

384
00:27:21,729 --> 00:27:23,269
I will take care of you separately.

385
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:41,478
(Branding in Seongsu)

386
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:45,518
(Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, KOCCA)
