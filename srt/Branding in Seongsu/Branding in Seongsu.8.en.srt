1
00:00:00,008 --> 00:00:01,008
(Supported by the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism...)

2
00:00:01,009 --> 00:00:02,016
(and the Korea Creative Content Agency)

3
00:00:02,017 --> 00:00:03,178
(All people, organizations, locations, and incidents...)

4
00:00:03,203 --> 00:00:03,531
(in this drama are fictitious.)

5
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:13,380
Darn it.

6
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,411
Here's another one.

7
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:20,850
You...

8
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:23,051
Who are you?

9
00:02:21,411 --> 00:02:22,810
(Kim Ji Eun, Lomon)

10
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:24,010
(Yang Hye Ji, Kim Ho Young)

11
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,200
(Branding in Seongsu)

12
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,031
It seems to be a sudden shock.

13
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,570
It's been a month since she has been unconscious.

14
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:52,770
Will she be okay?

15
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:55,580
We can't assure how she'll be if another shock hits her.

16
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:14,901
Oh, right. I didn't mention this since you sounded like someone else.

17
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,901
About our factory's CCTV.

18
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:20,200
The memory card was missing when I checked.

19
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,669
Please check.

20
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,411
Was the CCTV's memory card there?

21
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,770
Yes, it was.

22
00:03:25,771 --> 00:03:28,681
But during the investigation with the police, they said it was there.

23
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:31,281
It definitely wasn't there when I checked.

24
00:03:45,661 --> 00:03:49,299
Hello. We have with us today Seongsu Agency's Do Yoo Mi.

25
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,600
We'll begin our interview.

26
00:03:51,971 --> 00:03:53,829
This show was the talk of the town.

27
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,471
I heard Seongsu Agency was in charge of it.

28
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,870
Yes. Seongsu Agency...

29
00:03:58,871 --> 00:04:01,379
aims to become a greater agency that respects the voices of...

30
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,310
minority groups and brands.

31
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:06,310
We will make sure to show our greater change to everyone.

32
00:04:06,311 --> 00:04:09,580
We will look forward to your meaningful endeavors.

33
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,020
Thank you.

34
00:04:11,021 --> 00:04:12,590
All right.

35
00:04:12,591 --> 00:04:15,120
This might be a tough question for you.

36
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,729
The recent Kang Na Eon incident...

37
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,190
has been investigated to have occurred as a suicidal attempt.

38
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:22,160
There's a predominant public opinion...

39
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:24,201
that Seongsu Agency and Segye Group are responsible for this.

40
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,700
We want to hear about Seongsu Agency's current stance...

41
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:28,800
on this matter.

42
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,470
For thorough investigation,

43
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:34,940
we requested for a CCTV check with the police.

44
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:36,280
(Seongsu Agency's current stance?)

45
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:40,381
It turned out that Kang Na Eon wasn't trying to commit suicide.

46
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:43,120
It wasn't true?

47
00:04:48,891 --> 00:04:49,920
Oh, gosh!

48
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,401
We can't be at fault...

49
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:56,961
for taking a fall while being drunk.

50
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:00,400
She just fell?

51
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:02,170
She hit rock bottom while being drunk on her own?

52
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,511
(Live Room)

53
00:05:27,901 --> 00:05:28,930
Was it you?

54
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:31,100
The one to make Kang Na Eon like that?

55
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,771
What are you talking about? It was an accident.

56
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:37,300
Why you little...

57
00:05:38,641 --> 00:05:41,080
Ms. Do, you should come out.

58
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:42,711
I'm busy right now.

59
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:44,309
Well...

60
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,479
I told you I'm busy right now!

61
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,180
It's Ms. Kang.

62
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,850
What?

63
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,831
You.

64
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,240
- What's going on? - What?

65
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,391
What are you doing?

66
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,661
It's me.

67
00:07:06,591 --> 00:07:08,430
Why am I here?

68
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,100
Who are you?

69
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,340
Ms. Kang must still be out of it.

70
00:07:18,341 --> 00:07:19,440
What's going on?

71
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,480
Stay quiet and come with me.

72
00:07:26,951 --> 00:07:28,580
- What's going on? - What's going on?

73
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:30,581
What are they up to?

74
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:36,360
Gosh.

75
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,930
Who are you?

76
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:40,730
Keep it down, So Eun Ho.

77
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,600
Is it you?

78
00:07:52,771 --> 00:07:53,940
No way.

79
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:59,480
How can our souls change? This isn't some kind of drama.

80
00:08:00,881 --> 00:08:02,951
There's no way you're the female lead.

81
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:04,919
You're the male lead? This is the end of the world.

82
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,350
I'm good-looking.

83
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,321
Forget about that.

84
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,521
But...

85
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:13,430
why do you seem okay about it?

86
00:08:13,891 --> 00:08:15,401
It has been a while since it happened.

87
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,870
No way.

88
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:27,271
You haven't been checking out...

89
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:31,281
and touching my body, have you?

90
00:08:34,381 --> 00:08:36,151
That's sexual harassment!

91
00:08:36,521 --> 00:08:38,491
Look who's talking, you punk!

92
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:41,920
Don't be cursing with my pretty lips.

93
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:44,460
- You crazy punk! - I told you to stop!

94
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,001
It's your body that's only precious?

95
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,631
Fine.

96
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,501
Let's sort things out.

97
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,111
What are they doing?

98
00:09:05,781 --> 00:09:08,050
What are you doing?

99
00:09:08,981 --> 00:09:10,781
- Check this out. - Gosh!

100
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,761
What are you doing?

101
00:09:19,661 --> 00:09:22,231
Gosh. What's wrong with you?

102
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,300
Oh, gosh.

103
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,111
Put it back on.

104
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,011
We're at the office.

105
00:09:37,141 --> 00:09:39,481
Get back home right now.

106
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:43,450
Okay.

107
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,300
Which home would that be?

108
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,170
- Your home. - Right.

109
00:10:06,771 --> 00:10:08,640
So that means...

110
00:10:08,641 --> 00:10:10,840
- Your home, So Eun Ho! - Right. Got it.

111
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,851
- What? - What?

112
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,121
Ms. Kang?

113
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,090
How are you here?

114
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,560
That's not me!

115
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:27,031
You've mistaken me for someone else!

116
00:10:29,661 --> 00:10:30,730
What?

117
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,001
It's definitely her.

118
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,830
How is she here?

119
00:10:35,641 --> 00:10:37,001
Gosh.

120
00:10:37,241 --> 00:10:39,670
What's with the free supply?

121
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,781
Mind your own business.

122
00:10:44,141 --> 00:10:45,180
Okay.

123
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,210
I will.

124
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,090
Excuse me!

125
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:03,800
What was that?

126
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,040
Kang Na Eon?

127
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,340
Na Eon.

128
00:11:12,411 --> 00:11:13,670
Are you back?

129
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,710
Gosh.

130
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,810
- But... - Get off me. Wrong person.

131
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:21,851
No. I am the right person.

132
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:24,420
Well...

133
00:11:24,521 --> 00:11:26,621
What are you saying? Are you okay?

134
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,920
How did you get here?

135
00:11:31,631 --> 00:11:33,631
Well...

136
00:11:34,231 --> 00:11:37,429
So I have to get back home right away.

137
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,031
Ms. Kang will get at me if I don't.

138
00:11:40,501 --> 00:11:41,570
I apologize.

139
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,241
Na Eon!

140
00:11:46,871 --> 00:11:48,281
That was Kang Na Eon.

141
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,680
That was her, right?

142
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,360
So to make things clear,

143
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:03,290
Ms. Kang who fell while being drunk...

144
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,430
came back to the office?

145
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,960
Is she a zombie?

146
00:12:06,961 --> 00:12:10,430
And Eun Ho greeted her...

147
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:12,131
while being shirtless.

148
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,430
How was it?

149
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,340
There was no demand for it.

150
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,070
So which team will she be sent to?

151
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,240
If she attempted suicide because of the company,

152
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,679
the company would be responsible.

153
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,851
She would have the cause to be sent to a different team.

154
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:28,179
She just fell while being drunk.

155
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,521
Why would the company have to listen to her?

156
00:12:29,621 --> 00:12:33,351
But there's no reason to fire someone who has returned.

157
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,121
That means...

158
00:12:35,661 --> 00:12:38,430
She won't be the marketing manager and be moved to a different team.

159
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:41,560
Perhaps, our team?

160
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,101
Where are you going?

161
00:12:49,141 --> 00:12:50,141
To escort her.

162
00:12:51,611 --> 00:12:52,710
Ms. Kang.

163
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,080
Gosh.

164
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,981
What is all this?

165
00:13:04,351 --> 00:13:06,290
Memorize everything inside.

166
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:10,060
What?

167
00:13:11,391 --> 00:13:13,661
I don't know why we've switched bodies.

168
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:16,160
But for the time being,

169
00:13:16,161 --> 00:13:18,300
you have to be me, and I have to be you.

170
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:20,400
It's everything about me.

171
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:23,141
Of course, 99 percent of it is about my work.

172
00:13:24,501 --> 00:13:26,911
Do you know anything about me?

173
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:30,240
Date of birth, May 24, 1995, 11am.

174
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:32,610
Place of birth, South Gyeongsang, Seongam, Seongam Hospital.

175
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,449
Graduated from Seongam Kindergarten, Je Kwang Elementary School,

176
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,980
Yu Rim All-Male Middle School, and Yu Rim All-Male High School.

177
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:38,050
- Your first relationship... - Hey!

178
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,550
Let's end it there.

179
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:46,460
Right. There's something that I don't know.

180
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,330
That night when I fell.

181
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,300
Why were you at the factory?

182
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,310
I was on my way to meet you.

183
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,040
That was when you fell.

184
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,881
Why were you trying to see me?

185
00:14:04,281 --> 00:14:05,751
Because I was worried.

186
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,580
I felt like I was at fault...

187
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,550
- for that to happen to you. - Why?

188
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:13,751
Were you the one to report about XU's corruption?

189
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,231
(Enter passcode.)

190
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,241
Well, that was easy.

191
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,740
(My albums)

192
00:14:33,741 --> 00:14:35,741
(There are no photos or videos.)

193
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,580
(There are no photos or videos.)

194
00:14:39,581 --> 00:14:41,111
(Da Eun)

195
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,090
What's up with this guy?

196
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,090
He was cheating?

197
00:14:52,161 --> 00:14:53,261
What?

198
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
We were together that night.

199
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,430
Seriously?

200
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,070
Don't you remember?

201
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:02,641
We...

202
00:15:08,511 --> 00:15:09,840
We kissed that night.

203
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,720
Right.

204
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,651
You had a girlfriend.

205
00:15:21,991 --> 00:15:23,560
But you used lips as if you didn't care.

206
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:29,930
She's just a friend.

207
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,031
It was just a prank.

208
00:15:33,371 --> 00:15:34,401
Anyway...

209
00:15:36,401 --> 00:15:38,610
Did you fall while being drunk...

210
00:15:38,611 --> 00:15:40,170
from the rooftop of the pop-up store building?

211
00:15:42,381 --> 00:15:43,440
No.

212
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,391
What's that?

213
00:16:12,911 --> 00:16:14,271
But why a rabbit?

214
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,450
No way.

215
00:16:19,751 --> 00:16:20,810
What?

216
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,680
Was it the curse of the rabbit?

217
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,650
You were quite harsh against the rabbit.

218
00:16:26,651 --> 00:16:29,290
You were saying all these things while the rabbit was listening.

219
00:16:35,401 --> 00:16:37,429
No matter what you've done wrong,

220
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,770
it's the rabbit's fault to try to kill someone.

221
00:16:39,771 --> 00:16:41,740
You punk! How could you do that?

222
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:43,271
Come here!

223
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,741
I'll take care of it. Stay right there!

224
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,011
So...

225
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,911
you're suspecting all of them?

226
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,481
But...

227
00:16:57,381 --> 00:16:59,890
why are suspecting a cute and lovely guy like me?

228
00:16:59,891 --> 00:17:01,151
(So Eun Ho)

229
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,861
You're exempted.

230
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,730
You're too soft.

231
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:12,970
Right.

232
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,240
That...

233
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,510
was a deep grudge.

234
00:17:21,811 --> 00:17:23,841
What kind of life have you been living?

235
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,520
Get ready.

236
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:31,450
For what?

237
00:17:36,161 --> 00:17:37,321
You have to return...

238
00:17:40,391 --> 00:17:41,391
to where I am.

239
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:43,700
What?

240
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,939
Gosh. It's so heavy. Is helping out that hard?

241
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,780
You have my body too.

242
00:17:57,611 --> 00:18:00,650
Gosh. There are green slippers.

243
00:18:00,651 --> 00:18:02,249
I'm going to wear these.

244
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,351
You can wear these.

245
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,460
Look at this place.

246
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,000
It's huge.

247
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,210
Look at that!

248
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,051
This is amazing. We're so high up.

249
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,750
Gosh.

250
00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:43,190
Na Eon.

251
00:18:44,121 --> 00:18:46,161
Being switched doesn't seem that bad.

252
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,301
You can't even handle the maintenance cost.

253
00:18:58,841 --> 00:19:00,510
What is all that?

254
00:19:01,071 --> 00:19:02,280
Why do you have so many?

255
00:19:04,581 --> 00:19:05,611
Take this.

256
00:19:06,611 --> 00:19:07,611
What?

257
00:19:07,911 --> 00:19:10,080
What about my phone?

258
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:11,250
I must use it.

259
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,190
What about your phone?

260
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,291
I will be using that too.

261
00:19:18,161 --> 00:19:19,831
She only cares about herself.

262
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:24,930
Na Eon.

263
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:29,101
Why do you think our souls have switched?

264
00:19:31,911 --> 00:19:34,140
In dramas or movies,

265
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:36,541
there's always a reason behind something.

266
00:19:37,411 --> 00:19:38,680
For example,

267
00:19:39,651 --> 00:19:42,279
someone has liked someone...

268
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,520
for a very long time.

269
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:48,720
That's not me.

270
00:19:53,631 --> 00:19:54,690
Is it you?

271
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:57,260
It isn't me too either.

272
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:00,670
What's wrong?

273
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,871
You said you wanted to know who I was down to my soul.

274
00:20:06,641 --> 00:20:08,210
That was because...

275
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:11,979
you kept teasing me about things...

276
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,551
so I made things up.

277
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:16,081
Na Eon.

278
00:20:16,321 --> 00:20:18,821
- Forced sexual violence... - Well...

279
00:20:23,791 --> 00:20:24,861
It's quite fascinating.

280
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,831
I'm talking about dramas or movies.

281
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:35,801
They must really love themselves...

282
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,510
for them to kiss their own selves.

283
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:44,381
Then you can just stop. What's wrong with you?

284
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,680
You don't want to go back?

285
00:20:48,551 --> 00:20:49,581
What?

286
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,321
Oh, right.

287
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,291
Let's do it.

288
00:20:56,891 --> 00:20:58,020
Let's kiss.

289
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:02,051
I must have been...

290
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,551
holding on for too long.

291
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:13,631
