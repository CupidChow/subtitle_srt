1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,460
   

2
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:23,780
You...

3
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:29,930
Oh my gosh, my gosh! What's going on?

4
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:31,870
I'll keep it a secret.

5
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,760
- Hold on— 
 - Jenny, Rex.

6
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,820
- Huh? 
 - What? What? What?

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,810
Well...

8
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:37,930
- My gosh. 
 - Oh, my.

9
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,450
You guys look awesome!

10
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:42,270
My gosh, those two...

11
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,690
- Don't take pictures! 
 - What are you doing?

12
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,320
My gosh.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,950
You guys look awesome though!

14
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,500
- Hold on. 
 - Get up right now.

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,650
Give me the key. The key.

16
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:51,920
Here you go. Here you go.

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,190
- Good. Okay. 
 - What are you doing? Get it off.

18
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,550
What are you doing right now?

19
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,900
Don't push me. What? What? What? What?

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,970
Sunbae, seriously.

21
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,060
It hurts. Where did everyone go?

22
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:06,420
Hurry up and take it off! This isn't right.

23
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,000
- It worked. 
 - My chastity!

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,800
I'm the one who should be saying that.

25
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,540
   

26
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,360
   

27
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,090
   

28
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,550
   

29
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,850
   

30
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:41,980
   

31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:50,860


32
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,390
You could have just called. Why did you make me come here?

33
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,500
Come on, why are you in such a rush?

34
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,420
Here.

35
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,450
Let's have a drink and—

36
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,120
It's not that I'm in a rush,

37
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,820
I just think of it as a waste of time.

38
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,420
I'll leave if it isn't anything important.

39
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,040
Kang Na Eon!

40
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,150
You must be very stressed out because of her.

41
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:35,120
Director Han might take care of it if I just give him a call.

42
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,570
What? Do I look impressive now?

43
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,640
Hey.

44
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,650
Don't be cheeky.

45
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,310
I'll take care of Kang Na Eon myself.

46
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,190
Thanks for the drink.

47
00:03:14,370 --> 00:03:16,380
Hey...

48
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:21,950
What a bitch. Who does she think she is?

49
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,430
Well, their products are... better than I thought.

50
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:52,720
Yes, it looks like...

51
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,650
the products are perfectly designed for the female body.

52
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:58,790
They are designed for both pleasure and convenience.

53
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:03,890
I think they don't sell not because of the products but of the marketing concept.

54
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:06,520
It's also hard to get around in the store as it's like a maze.

55
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,170
Right! Okay, noted.

56
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,670
By the way,

57
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:19,320
living as a woman is very inconvenient.

58
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:23,780
You have to hide many things, and it's tiring too.

59
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,970
Sunbae, please get me some sanitary pads.

60
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,240
Go get them yourself.

61
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,800
Just get them for me.

62
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,500
I'm embarrassed to do it myself.

63
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,360
You're right.

64
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,790
It would make more sense for me to go now.

65
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,190
I'll be right back.

66
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,820
- Welcome. 
 - Hello.

67
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:05,450
Come on.

68
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,200
Why tuck away something this important like this?

69
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:11,990
   

70
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,040
Okay, here we go.

71
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:33,190
Wow, Jenny, don't worry about me and just carry on— I mean...

72
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:35,550
Hi, Team Leader.

73
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:36,940
This is great.

74
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:39,720
Have you used these by chance?

75
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,930
Which one's better?

76
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:45,480
   

77
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,720
   

78
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,060
J-Jenny, there's someone behind you. What are you doing? How embarrassing...

79
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,860
What's the big deal?

80
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,750
It's not like I'm buying something forbidden.

81
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,260
I'll go with King today.

82
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:09,190
Bye-bye.

83
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,370
I suppose...

84
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:20,120
It's not like you're buying something forbidden.

85
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:52,250
What's this?

86
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,460
Geez, what did he do?

87
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,160
He turned the house into a botanical garden.

88
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,200
Hey, So Eun Ho.

89
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:31,220
So Eun Ho.

90
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,340
Where did he go?

91
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,080
So Eun Ho.

92
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:42,300
So Eun Ho!

93
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,980
Hey, So Eun...

94
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,260
That son of a bitch.

95
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,540
Shit.

96
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,460
 I'm sorry, but please come to work an hour earlier than usual today. 
   

97
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:02,120
 - Thanks for understanding. 
 - Geez! 

98
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,770
 Too much traffic on the subway. 

99
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:11,920
 I need to drop off the kids at daycare first. 

100
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:15,060
 I got stuck in the elevator. 

101
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,070
 I see. I'm sorry. 

102
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,260
 Let's just meet at the normal time. 

103
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:23,670
What's with the tone in his voice?

104
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,750
He won't answer the phone, either. What's he plotting?

105
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:34,830
Hey, So Eun—

106
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:38,240
- Don't worry. 
 - Yes, yes.

107
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,370
Would you be okay with this client?

108
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,900
Gosh, why would you ask that?

109
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,300
Well, I was wondering if that would be possible.

110
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,180
Oh! You came?

111
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,500
What makes you think...

112
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,050
Yes, yes. Thank you.

113
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:54,000
What is... all this?

114
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,430
   

115
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,250
   

116
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,870
   

117
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:39,630
I think living as a woman comes with a lot of constraints.

118
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:43,110
Even more so when we think about women's sex lives.

119
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:53,440
So we approached women's sex lives, which have been hidden and treated as a taboo...

120
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,270
from the completely opposite direction.

121
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:02,500
The products you sell were tested for safety

122
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,700
and they're very high quality.

123
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,280
We'll take advantage of the fact that

124
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:14,490
you have to use it secretly, which is a weakness for adult products. 
    

125
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,420
What are you saying?

126
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:21,700
Are you telling me to...

127
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:25,130
have straight black hair right now?

128
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Yes.

129
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,480
Are you crazy?

130
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,370
Well...

131
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:42,000
The brand identity the consumers perceive...

132
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:48,840
is completely inseparable from your image. Yes...

133
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,290
Since we're popularizing the brand image...

134
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:01,980
making your image more professional...

135
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,590
is basically our goal.

136
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,890
- Yes. 
   - Yes. 

137
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,570
Look here!

138
00:11:11,570 --> 00:11:14,690
Straight black hair...

139
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:20,680
suits me well.

140
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:24,170
I-I-If so...

141
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,200
I'll take your suggestion.

142
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:40,680
♫  Just call me "Lady", not "someone's so-and-so"  ♫

143
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,980
♫  Don't call me "Of Yours"  ♫

144
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,310
♫  I may achieve my dream, get up, I'm driven by pain  ♫

145
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:52,070
Jenny... I'm so excited.

146
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:57,860
Please straighten it completely.

147
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:05,280
♫  Just call me "Lady", don't call me "Of Yours"  ♫

148
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:12,900
♫  Just call me "Lady", don't call me "Of Yours"  ♫

149
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,330
Wow, daebak.

150
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:22,650
It's completely open in all directions.

151
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,610
- Let's go with this— 
 - Let's go with this—

152
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,090
Let's go with this one.

153
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,870
So cool!

154
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,160
Honey, that's way too small.

155
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,080
I can't read it. I need to see what it says.

156
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,430
Make it bigger. Fill it up completely.

157
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,970
We need something more impactful at this point.

158
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,490
My gosh, hello.

159
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,220
Team Leader.

160
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:56,140
- Fighting. 
 - No...

161
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,550
- Don't go. 
 - Thank you.

162
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,660
Please don't go.

163
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,990
Excuse me. We need to finish what we started.

164
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:03,680
It doesn't work if you enlarge it like this.

165
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,080
You told me to do this!

166
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,700
Cha Jeong Woo.

167
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:15,540
Hey, Cha Jeong Woo!

168
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:22,450
Did you decide to ignore me completely?

169
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:24,450
You don't even reply to my texts.

170
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:29,050
I wasn't sure what you wanted me to say,

171
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,900
Team Leader.

172
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,210
Kang Na Eon...

173
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,240
She won't return to her prior self, no matter how much you want it.

174
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,970
She'll get discarded after being used in the Underdog Team.

175
00:13:41,970 --> 00:13:44,600
I'll make sure that happens.

176
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:51,560
Hey!

177
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,630
What?

178
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,900
Do I need to know what Kang Na Eon's concept for the pop-up is right now?

179
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:13,510
Just stop her! Stop her from doing anything!

180
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,700
It's me.

181
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,460
I'll have to spend the budget sooner.

182
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:33,070
I have to stop Kang Na Eon from the start.

183
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,670
What? Wait, what happened?

184
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:45,520
W-What's this? 
    

185
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,140
I'm sorry about that.

186
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:54,450
I couldn't say no since they gave me a better offer.

187
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:59,450
Or you could pay me more rent.

188
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:01,890
Who's renting the space?

189
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:05,230
Was it Seongsu Agency's Team 1?

190
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,840
Pardon?

191
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,730
Gosh, I got the chills.

192
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,990
I can't believe this.

193
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,770
Gosh, what do we do? What's going on?

194
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:25,630
I should've known when things were going too well.

195
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:29,430
The pop-up opens tomorrow. What do we do?

196
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,270
 One day to go! 

197
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,650
 A secretive new pop-up on Seongsu Intersection. 

198
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,000
 Coming Soon! 

199
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,460
Gosh, Jenny always has to jump the gun at times like this.

200
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:45,150
What do we do?

201
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,650
Let's look for another place since we're in a rush.

202
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:50,350
No one else would want a business like this.

203
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,170
They freak and hang up as soon as I bring up the words "sex toy."

204
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,270
Be quiet.

205
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,010
Gosh, how embarrassing.

206
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,970
Gosh, my stomach. Why does it hurt so much right now?

207
00:16:02,970 --> 00:16:05,180
Gosh, my stomach.

208
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,400
It's because you chugged the venti-sized coffee.

209
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,440
Did you have to say that directly in my ear?

210
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,340
Gosh, this is no good.

211
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,820
- I'll get some medicine at a pharmacy. 
 - Okay.

212
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,250
Gosh, it hurts. Why does it hurt so much?

213
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,860
The pharmacy on the first floor is closed.

214
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,350
Go to the one on the other side over there.

215
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:27,890
Gosh, I'm sorry. My stomach...

216
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,140
See you.

217
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:33,940
Gosh, Sunbae.

218
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,080
What do we do? Are we really completely done for?

219
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,270
Are we completely done for?

220
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:42,060
I asked you first. Are we done for—

221
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,440
The pharmacy on the first floor. Did they close because the business failed?

222
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:52,000
Well, I suppose so. Since it wasn't in a hospital.

223
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,180
Okay.

224
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,040
What does she mean, "Okay"?

225
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,260
Wait for me.

226
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,890
Where are you going? Seriously!

227
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,990
What will you do now?

228
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:06,080
Gosh, seriously.

229
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:09,210
Geez, I'm dying. Why does it hurt so much?

230
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,110
What now?

231
00:17:12,110 --> 00:17:14,900
- Hello? My stomach... 
  - Find out who the owner is of the building on 

232
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,490
 Seongsu Intersection with the closed pharmacy. 

233
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,290
What did you say?

234
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,940
That rude jerk. He always hangs up when he's done talking.

235
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,070
Gosh, it hurts.

236
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,610
Shit.

237
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,000
Pardon?

238
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,950
You want to open the pop-up store at the closed pharmacy?

239
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:36,570
Pharmacies have interiors visible from the outside to give you a sense of trust.

240
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:41,160
Thinking about it, that pharmacy had glass walls.

241
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,620
But since they just closed, the interior must be...

242
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,620
Kang Na Eon, you genius.

243
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,430
Are you done with your coffee?

244
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,060
Pardon?

245
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,820
Throw this away.

246
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,310
You devil!

247
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,950
   

248
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:38,670
S-Sunbae... w-would this work?

249
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:41,240
We need to make it work.

250
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,860
   

251
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:52,640
Yes, Yeong Ae.

252
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,580
 What do we do? 

253
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:01,550
We won't be able to reach the building owner immediately since they're on vacation.

254
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:13,910
 Emergency! 

255
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:17,270
 There's an emergency at the office. 

256
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:22,290
Hurry up, Sunbae. I'm sure you could do something.

257
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:25,440
Why doesn't this work?

258
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:28,680
W-Why are you crying?

259
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,900
I don't know.

260
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,160
We created something really amazing, but—

261
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:40,680
The Section Chief Noh of Team 1 came by and... and... and...

262
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,060
Pink is too obvious.

263
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:47,370
You have to make it fun. Change the pink and—

264
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:49,660
What do you know?

265
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:53,230
I almost said that. But this is...

266
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:57,770
And switch to a serif font to make it look more upscale.

267
00:19:57,770 --> 00:20:00,570
-Give me a break. 
 - Oh, I'm sorry.

268
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,040
So, change this right now.

269
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,350
- Just change it. 
 - But this is—

270
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,990
- This is better. Why— 
 - Okay.

271
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,750
Everyone stop.

272
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,790
Stop.

273
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:10,880
W-What's going on?

274
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:16,190
We're banned from assigning projects to other teams without following proper procedures.

275
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:18,960
Since when did we do that?

276
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,570
- Rookie Seo Wool Soop, 
 - Yes?

277
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:22,530
can I see your computer?

278
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:23,720
You can't.

279
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,160
Delete what you've been working on immediately.

280
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:27,240
- I don't want to! 
 - What do you mean, delete it?

281
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,220
 What are you doing? Stop! Stop! 

282
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:36,060
So our design is completely gone.

283
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,960
I'm sorry.

284
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,360
I'm sorry.

285
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,860
You should have the protected it.

286
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,100
You should've stopped him.

287
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:48,070
You should've called someone...

288
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,180
Stop!

289
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,200
Are they allowed to go this far?

290
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,000
What's the problem?

291
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,730
Are we not allowed to go this far?

292
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:05,040
I did exactly as you said.

293
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,120
Pardon?

294
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,540
"Pardon?"

295
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,660
Why are you speaking formally?

296
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:11,960
What?

297
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,520
W-What did I say, exactly?

298
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,870
You said negotiation is possible when you hold something crucial.

299
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:26,440
You need a pop-up location, but I have that.

300
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:33,020
And you need a design for the pop-up, but I have the power to get rid of it.

301
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,090
I have everything you want.

302
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,300
So make a deal with me.

303
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:47,960
What is it that you want?

304
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,390
Your pride.

305
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:56,360
Go ahead and ask me for help.

306
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,130
I'll consider it then.

307
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:06,570
You, too, So Eun Ho.

308
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,970
You should beg too.

309
00:22:12,390 --> 00:22:15,180
I promise I won't interfere then.

310
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,930
Are you serious right now?

311
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,610
You don't want to?

312
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,150
Sorry.

313
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:31,790
What?

314
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,910
I'm so sorry.

315
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:38,580
I have no idea what I did wrong.

316
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,740
I apologize for that.

317
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:43,300
How dare you talk casually to me?

318
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,250
One more thing.

319
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,380
You're not affecting us at all,

320
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,770
no matter what you do.

321
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,510
I'm sorry about that, too.

322
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,020
- Hey! 
 - What?

323
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:59,210
I swear...

324
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:02,490
I swear I won't sit back and leave you alone.

325
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:11,930


326
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:15,430
   

327
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,330
♫  I'm breaking rocks  ♫

328
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:29,850
♫  As if I was born again a thousand times  ♫

329
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:35,900
♫  And I'm breaking rocks, I'm breaking rocks  ♫

330
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,220
♫  Step by step, higher  ♫

331
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,920
♫  I don't care what you think  ♫

00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,860
♫  I'll rock it in my style  ♫

333
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,080
♫  Just like a wrecking ball  ♫

334
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,770
♫  Fly freely  ♫

335
00:23:55,770 --> 00:24:00,930
♫  Just go ahead and fire it up, break all the way  ♫
