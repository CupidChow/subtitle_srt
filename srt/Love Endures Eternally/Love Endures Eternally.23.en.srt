=Episode 23=

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,680
Crown Prince seems to prefer
the life of commoners.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
He's only suffering here.

16
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,439
My grudge against Shen Yi
has been buried for more than 20 years.

17
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:22,040
The situation is now so out of control

18
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,319
that too many lives are involved.

19
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:28,799
Go outside the city
and invite Shen Yi here.

20
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:34,040
It's time to settle everything.

21
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:36,599
Yes.

22
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,439
His Majesty has excellent tactics.

23
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,790
He not only kills lives
but also breaks spirits.

24
00:01:50,319 --> 00:01:53,000
What did I owe you in my previous life

25
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,560
that made you treat me like this?

26
00:02:33,479 --> 00:02:34,840
Do you still miss her?

27
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,319
How could I not think about her?

28
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,479
I'm dying from missing her.

29
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,639
She's...

30
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,919
Still alive.

31
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,800
Look.

32
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,879
We grew up together.

33
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:15,960
You helped me ascend to this throne.

34
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,959
At one point,

35
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,319
the rift between us grew so deep

36
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:25,360
that we went against each other.

37
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,160
I used to treat you like a brother.

38
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:37,160
I was willing
to go through fire and water for you.

39
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,600
And you?

40
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:44,079
You violated
my beloved wife, Gao Ruowei,

41
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,800
killed my second wife, Cui Lanping,

42
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,759
and wiped out the Shen family.

43
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,279
Why?

44
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,680
Sometimes

45
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:00,399
I often wonder

46
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:02,959
about the time when we were young
and went out drinking together.

47
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,079
This first glass is for our lost bond.

48
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,839
We used to be brothers

49
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,759
who shared everything.

50
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,560
Without you,

51
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:28,480
I wouldn't be king.

52
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,680
This second glass

53
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,879
is for your military career.

54
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,800
You worked hard
for the country and the people.

55
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,879
Nanling is safe

56
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:54,800
because of General Shen Yi.

57
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,639
This third glass

58
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,680
is for raising Mu.

59
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:11,600
You're loyal and righteous.

60
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,639
Even if he kills
the king with his own hands,

61
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,680
he's willing
to go through fire and water for you.

62
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,240
You keep thanking me,

63
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,439
but you don't have any regrets.

64
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,279
Don't you

65
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,600
feel a little guilty

66
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,399
toward me,

67
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:42,439
Ruowei,

68
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:45,560
Mu,

69
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,079
the Shen family,

70
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,199
and the people?

71
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,680
Have you forgotten?

72
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,279
When I was fifteen,

73
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,959
Ruowei and I

74
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,759
were already in love.

75
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:25,199
Because of the Queen Mother,

76
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,360
the Gao family was wiped out.

77
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,279
I thought Ruowei had already died.

78
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,879
Five years later,

79
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,560
she appeared in the brothel.

80
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:41,240
Yet you secretly married her
without telling me.

81
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,399
When I found out,

82
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,240
she has become
the matriarch of the Shen family.

83
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:51,759
I would rather trade the throne
for a lifetime with Ruowei.

84
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,160
It's you

85
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,759
who stole my lover.

86
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,800
Yes.

87
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:03,959
I was wrong first.

88
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,519
But when Queen Mother

89
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,759
killed the Gao family,

90
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,959
you were destined not to be together.

91
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,000
Right?

92
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,000
All these years,

93
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,319
Mu and I

94
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:30,079
just want an apology from you.

95
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,360
Is that difficult?

96
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,799
Yes.

97
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,960
A king

98
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,080
has no right to talk about love.

99
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,200
How do you know I'm not guilty?

100
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,240
How do you know

101
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:57,200
it wasn't painful for me

102
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,879
to face you and Mu

103
00:09:00,879 --> 00:09:02,240
in the past 20 years?

104
00:09:03,679 --> 00:09:04,480
However,

105
00:09:05,759 --> 00:09:07,279
I will still do the same

106
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,759
if I get to start over.
