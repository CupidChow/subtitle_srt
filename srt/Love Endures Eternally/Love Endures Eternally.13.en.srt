00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:57,960
Young Master Shen.

15
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,000
My marriage to Ms. Chi Yuan
is arranged by His Majesty.

16
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,039
It's legitimate.

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,040
It's a done deal.

18
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:10,359
I hope you'll allow it.

19
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,359
Chi Yuan.

20
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:44,680
Chi Yuan,
I know you only like Shen Zhaomu.

21
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,959
I won't force you.

22
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,959
I came here today to tell you

23
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,319
that I'll find a chance
to explain to His Majesty

24
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,239
and ask him to withdraw this marriage.

25
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,159
The betrothal gifts delivery

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,159
is just a delaying tactic.

27
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,040
Is that true?

28
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,200
Of course.

29
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,239
However...

30
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,520
(To Father, Shen Yi)

31
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,240
Why do you have this letter?

32
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,759
This letter
was originally intended for His Majesty.

33
00:02:14,919 --> 00:02:16,039
I now have it.

34
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,319
If others find out about this letter,

35
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,680
Shen Zhaomu might get killed.

36
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,240
No way. I already sent it.

37
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,220
(Father, Shen Yi)

38
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,719
It's real.

39
00:02:27,719 --> 00:02:29,080
Chi Yuan.

40
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,039
Maybe Shen Zhaomu
only has power in his mind.

41
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,960
He doesn't care about you
as much as you think.

42
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,439
I hope you can dissuade Shen Zhaomu

43
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,719
from rebelling.

44
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,639
Don't take the life and death
of those who love him lightly.

45
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:50,039
I see.

46
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,639
Prince Zhou.

47
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,439
Thank you.

48
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:04,319
Turns out

49
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:07,360
they're already together.

50
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,159
Even if we can't
be together in this life,

51
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,759
I still hope
that you can be safe and happy.

52
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,560
Chi Yuan, promise me

53
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,360
to make Shen Zhaomu
let go of his grudges.

54
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,080
Don't act rashly.

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,360
Or the consequences will be disastrous.

56
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:29,560
I think

57
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,560
we can be close friends.

58
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,360
Shen Zhaomu
will give up his hatred for me.

59
00:03:46,039 --> 00:03:46,840
Zhaomu.

60
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:50,319
Zhao...

61
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,460
(Shen Residence)

62
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,199
Zhaomu.

63
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,040
Will you give up
revenge and rebellion for me

64
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,759
and run away with me?

65
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:38,800
Chi Yuan.

66
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:42,199
Will you stay
for my revenge and rebellion?

67
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,040
I...

68
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,240
How many things are you hiding from me?

69
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,959
You better come clean.

70
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,160
Everything I did was for you.

71
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,240
Just believe me.

72
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:11,000
Sure.

73
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,399
I'll

74
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:17,639
believe you one last time.

75
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:22,120
We have a problem.

76
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:23,560
We have a problem.

77
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,800
General Shen was poisoned
and is critically ill.

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,160
Is our rebellion plan discovered?

79
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,959
No way.

80
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,639
The letter might not be delivered
so quickly.

81
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,560
Investigate once more.

82
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,720
(Sorry, Zhaomu.)

83
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,959
(I just want to protect you
in my own way.)

84
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,500
(To Father, Shen Yi)

85
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,100
(To)

86
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,560
It's not what you think.

87
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,839
Let me explain.

88
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,160
This is the best explanation.

89
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,639
It's not the case.

90
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,839
Prince Zhou gave me the letter.

91
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,399
I ordered you to send the letter.

92
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,959
Why was it with Prince Zhou?

93
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,560
What is your intention?

94
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,160
It's...

95
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,490
It's hard to describe this matter.

96
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:50,879
You collude with outsiders,

97
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,079
ruin my plans,

98
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,240
and secretly poisoned Shen Yi.

99
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,759
Look at each of these.

100
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,480
Are you protecting me

101
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,800
or betraying me?

102
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,000
No.

103
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,079
You had a change of heart

104
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,260
after entering Prince's Residence,
hadn't you?

105
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,720
No wonder you asked His Majesty
to make you my adopted sister.

106
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,680
No wonder you keep meeting in secret.

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,460
Turns out you just want
the glory of being a princess consort.

108
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,959
Chi Yuan.

109
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,199
I misjudged you after all.

110
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,240
Is revenge more important to you

111
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,199
than my life?

112
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,160
In your heart,

113
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,160
will hate always outweigh love?

114
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,639
I can see it now.

115
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:40,639
A sinister person like you

116
00:07:41,279 --> 00:07:43,079
insists on living in darkness.

117
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,399
Why should I bother?

118
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,959
I already told you.

119
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,279
Everyone in the world

120
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:54,399
can betray me,

121
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,040
