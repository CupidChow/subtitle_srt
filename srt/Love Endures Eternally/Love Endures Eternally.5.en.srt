=Episode 5=

14
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:05,040
Rather than becoming
a normal prince's consort,

15
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,860
it's better to become
a royal prince's consort.

16
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,719
Shen Xin is ruthless.

17
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,879
She just stabbed her mother in the back.

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,840
But the doctor also said

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,439
that Madam Cui
couldn't get out of bed for two months.

20
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:31,439
She's just putting on show to survive.

21
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,999
It's not the first time you've seen it.

22
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,040
I just don't know
how the General will react

23
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,319
when he finds out.

24
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,439
Zhaomu.

25
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:40,840
Why are you here?

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,840
Zhaomu, I wrote a poem today.

27
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,480
Comment on it for me.

28
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,159
Zhaomu?

29
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:50,040
Now that I know Zhaomu's true identity,

30
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:52,200
I shouldn't call him my brother anymore.

31
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,879
Your mother
isn't even out of danger yet.

32
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,699
You're already
thinking about composing poetry.

33
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,819
There are trees in the mountains,
and the trees have branches.

34
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,120
My heart is fond of you,
yet you don't know.

35
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,280
Do you have someone you like?

36
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:09,719
You also know him.

37
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:15,319
(What is she up to?
Is she blatantly provoking me?)

38
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,919
What nonsense is this?

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,879
Shen Xin, what are you up to?

40
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,599
Just tell us.

41
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,759
No need to do this.

42
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:27,879
Zhaomu, I'm the young lady
of Shen Residence after all.

43
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,879
Even a mere guard

44
00:02:30,039 --> 00:02:32,039
is fierce to me.

45
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:35,599
Chi Yuan, don't be rude.

46
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:36,560
Go out first.

47
00:02:38,039 --> 00:02:38,599
I...

48
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:39,719
Leave.

49
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,759
Why are you here?

50
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:54,879
Just tell me.

51
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,319
Zhaomu.

52
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:59,039
I know your true identity now,

53
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,319
But I hope the pain
that Madam Cui caused you

54
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:04,039
will end with her death.

55
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,800
I hope you can forgive us.

56
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:10,000
Since we grew up together,

57
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,240
why don't we get married?

58
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,479
This way,
when you enter the palace in the future,

59
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:17,360
you can still be with me
as the son-in-law of the Shen family.

60
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,240
Father will also be reassured.

61
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,999
Won't that be beneficial for everyone?

62
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,479
Is that what you came here
to talk about?

63
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:25,680
It's unnecessary.

64
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,919
Some things
aren't as simple as you think.

65
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,479
Zhaomu.

66
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,120
Young Master Zhaomu, Miss,
please have some tea.

67
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:38,360
You slave, do you want to die?

68
00:03:39,439 --> 00:03:41,120
I... I'm sorry.

69
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,120
Please forgive me.

70
00:03:45,479 --> 00:03:47,240
Qingyun﻿, leave first.

71
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:52,919
Why get angry over a maid?

72
00:03:52,919 --> 00:03:53,960
See if you're injured.

73
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,919
Look. It hurts.

74
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,960
Your clothes are wet.

75
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,599
Go back and get changed.

76
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,120
You're thoughtful.

77
00:04:06,199 --> 00:04:08,599
I'll go get changed.

78
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,480
Young Master Zhaomu has ordered
that no one can come near. Especially you.

79
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,240
Why?

80
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,120
I can't even visit my own mother?

81
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:40,639
Please don't give me a hard time.

82
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,279
We're just following orders.

83
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:42,839
You...

84
00:04:42,839 --> 00:04:44,519
Knowing your mother's temper,

85
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,040
she'll make you life a living hell
if she wakes up.

86
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,360
What nonsense are you talking about?

87
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,040
I hope mother can wake up, of course.

88
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:54,879
You're the Shen family's slave.

89
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,879
How dare you
meddle in your master's affairs?

90
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,199
Watch carefully.

91
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:03,600
If Madam Cui dies in an accident

92
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,600
or suffers anything,

93
00:05:06,399 --> 00:05:08,000
Young Master Zhaomu won't spare you.

94
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,079
Yes.

95
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:13,720
Chi Yuan.

96
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:16,000
Wait and see.

97
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,240
Young Master Zhaomu, these

98
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,439
are your favourite food.

99
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,040
Leave first.

100
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,399
Without my orders,

101
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,639
don't come in.

102
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,839
Close the door.

103
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,360
Yes.

104
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,079
What did she say?

105
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:42,720
She asked me to get out.

106
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:48,040
Zhaomu, since you've
taken over the residence's affairs,

107
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,079
let me know

108
00:05:50,319 --> 00:05:51,600
if you need me.

109
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,160
No thanks.

110
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,720
I know

111
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,839
Madam Cui has wronged you,

112
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,399
but I was also forced
to be controlled by her.

113
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,519
I hope you won't
hold grudges against me.

114
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,959
Are you done?

115
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:08,720
Leave if you're done.

116
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:12,279
I'm having dinner with Chi Yuan.

117
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:15,680
Zhaomu.

118
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,319
I have never offended you
since I was a child.

119
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:19,800
It was mostly Madam Cui's doing.

120
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,560
Father has passed on the title to you
and dotes on you.

121
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:25,199
I can accept that,

122
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:27,399
but you're indifferent to me.

123
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,199
How can I feel at ease?

124
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,120
If you behave yourself,

125
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,120
I won't give you trouble.

126
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:35,739
But there is no other possibility

127
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,879
between you and me

128
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,699
besides
our apparent sibling relationship.

129
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:43,120
If you have
any inappropriate ideas about me,

130
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,600
don't blame me
for not going easy on you.

131
00:06:45,879 --> 00:06:47,759
Okay, I'll do whatever you say.

132
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,399
Let's drink this wine today.

133
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:52,639
I'll go back to my room and stop bothering you.

134
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,439
Zhaomu, what's wrong?

135
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,600
Why is the wine so strong today?

136
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,600
I'll help you go rest.

137
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,000
Don't touch me.

138
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,720
Where's the military token?
Where did you hide the military token?

139
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,920
Dream on.

140
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,760
Young Master Zhaomu, did you ask for me?

141
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:54,199
No, don't come in.

142
00:07:57,139 --> 00:07:58,800
The military token my father left
is mine.

143
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,439
Chi Yuan!

144
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,199
Shen Xin, you...

145
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,399
Shen Xin, get off.

146
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,000
Chi Yuan.

147
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,160
Shen Xin, you're shameless.

148
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,639
Chi Yuan.

149
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:11,680
Zhaomu.

150
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,199
Chi Yuan.

151
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:16,839
Zhaomu.

152
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,360
You...

153
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,360
Let go.

154
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,160
Shen Zhaomu.

155
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,800
I... I didn't see anything.

156
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,879
Let go.

157
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,240
Chi Yuan.

158
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,159
Jerk.

159
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,999
Drink yourself to death.

160
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,080
Qingyun, let's go.

161
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,799
Young Master Zhaomu,
I'll send someone to fix the door.

162
00:08:54,679 --> 00:08:55,799
I finally found you.

163
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:57,679
Be careful.

164
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,799
It's cold. Don't get frostbite.

165
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,759
Ms. Chi Yuan, do you have feelings
for Young Master Zhaomu?

166
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:14,039
Is it that obvious?

167
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,639
Do you think Young Master Zhaomu

168
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,600
has any feelings for me?

169
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:21,519
He...

170
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:23,679
I don't know.

171
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,799
When did you fall for him?

172
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:33,879
I...

173
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,360
Maybe it's because he saved me

174
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,480
or maybe he fought for me.

175
00:09:43,639 --> 00:09:45,080
Or maybe it was nothing

176
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,200
but a feeling.

177
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:49,960
I would risk my life for him.

178
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:52,480
But I don't know if he likes me

179
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,960
or if he's just claiming me
as his guard out of habit.

180
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,399
Since you're doubtful,

181
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:01,039
why not ask him if he likes you?

182
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,960
That... That direct?

183
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:08,200
The Ms. Chi Yuan I know
has always been straightforward.

184
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:10,039
Why beat around the bush?

185
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,039
You're right.

186
00:10:18,679 --> 00:10:19,360
Chi Yuan.

187
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,799
Where are you going?

188
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,159
Someone, come!

189
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,759
Help! Someone, come!

190
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Help!

191
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:35,000
Someone, come!

192
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,799
How dare you? Shen Zhaomu.

193
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:39,200
You treat everyone the same.

194
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,799
Waiter.

195
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,840
Bring me another bottle of wine.

196
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,759
Miss, it's late.

197
00:11:06,759 --> 00:11:08,000
We're closing.

198
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,919
Please come again tomorrow.

199
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,440
I want to continue drinking.
Give me another bottle.

200
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,039
Refill this lady's wine.

201
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,000
Alright.

202
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,679
Please give me a minute.

203
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,279
Someone came to drink with me.

204
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:32,759
Cheers.

205
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:45,840
Say,

206
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:49,080
are all of you men

207
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,279
unable to resist women
who throw themselves into your arms?

208
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,320
Even if you can resist once,

209
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,519
can you resist

210
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,639
the second or the third time?

211
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,159
Don't hug me.

212
00:12:24,559 --> 00:12:25,360
Where's the wine?

213
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:29,159
Those who are devoted

214
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,840
and unwavering until death

215
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:34,200
only exist in stories.

216
00:12:36,879 --> 00:12:38,519
This wine is like fire.

217
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,039
It burns my eyes.

218
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,759
Ms. Chi Yuan.

219
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,399
Are you attracted to
that good-for-nothing Shen Zhaomu?

220
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:48,159
Shen Zhaomu?

221
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,200
What a joke.

222
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,159
With

223
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:54,159
his fragile body

224
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,519
and cautious personality,

225
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,320
why would I be attracted to him?

226
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,519
What else can he do

227
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:05,879
besides ordering me around?

228
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:08,080
If I didn't have a mission,

229
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,080
I wouldn't bother with him.

230
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,639
Who is he to make me attracted to him?

231
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:17,320
If I fall for him,

232
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,879
I'll take his last name.

233
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:26,320
In that case,

234
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,879
you're no longer my guard

235
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,600
(Favorability: 10)
from now on.

236
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,279
We have nothing to do with each other.
