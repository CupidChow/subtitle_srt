(Adapted from I'm Shameless'
Quick Transmigration: Defeated Again)

13
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,000
Chi Yuan. How dare you get pregnant
with your adopted older brother's baby?

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,439
Let's go.

15
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:01,719
Guards!

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,920
Don't be afraid.
We'll fight our way out.

17
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:10,760
Chop off the guilty woman's head
and hang it on the city wall for public display.

18
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:11,760
Who dares to do so?

19
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,799
If anything happens to her,

20
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,719
I'll die with her.

21
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:16,400
Nonsense.

22
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Watch out!

23
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:43,439
Chi Yuan.

24
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,400
Chi Yuan.

25
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:51,519
(Zhaomu, I didn't expect)

26
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,640
(to fail at rescuing you
from the prison of hatred in this life.)

27
00:01:57,599 --> 00:01:59,480
(But all encounters,)

28
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,560
(separations, love,
and hatred between people)

29
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:06,879
(are filled with regrets.)

30
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,960
(I'm so sad
that I can't accompany you to the end.)

31
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,240
(Zhaomu.)

32
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,599
(I don't want your life
to be clouded by hate.)

33
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,960
(Promise me not to avenge me.)

34
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,879
(You must live a good life for me.)

35
00:02:23,759 --> 00:02:24,680
(I love you.)

36
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,960
Chi Yuan.

37
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:37,660
=Episode 1=

38
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:42,120
Dr. Chen, why is this patient in a coma?

39
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:44,400
His name is Shen Zhaomu.

40
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,039
Because he carried too much hatred,

41
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,199
he chose selective consciousness death.

42
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,639
Your latest mission

43
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,759
is to enter his subconscious

44
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:57,240
and get his favorability for you
to 100 points in 100 days.

45
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,159
And we can approve

46
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,240
the energy transfer therapy.

47
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:03,639
This way, he can wake up.

48
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:07,639
Can I take six months off
after completing this mission?

49
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,840
Sure, but you'll disappear
into his subconscious

50
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:14,159
if you don't complete the mission.

51
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,759
Do you dare to challenge it?

52
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,199
I will heal this handsome man

53
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,400
with my love.

54
00:03:22,509 --> 00:03:24,560
Once Madam Cui
gives birth to Little Young Master,

55
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,280
Young Master Zhaomu's status
will diminish.

56
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,240
I don't think so.

57
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,120
Young Master Zhaomu
is charming and elegant.

58
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,539
He's also His Majesty's adopted son.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:31,919
What do you know?

60
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:33,280
I heard he's not adopted.

61
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,579
Madam Gao and His Majesty
were childhood sweethearts.

62
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,560
(Chi Yuan, The Shen Family's Guard)
(Another lowly maid.)

63
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,719
(Next,)

64
00:03:44,719 --> 00:03:46,759
(You'll be his only trusted bodyguard.)

65
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,400
Ouch.

66
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,120
(Chi Yuan, start your redemption plan.)

67
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,599
Transmigrating like this

68
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,080
is so not elegant.

69
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,879
It's so brutal too.

70
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,840
(Favorability: 0)
Shen Zhaomu's style is my type.

71
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,599
He doesn't look gloomy either.

72
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:14,190
(Shen Zhaomu, Shen family's Eldest Son)
(How come she stumbled today?)

73
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,560
(I can save a man,)

74
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,920
(but I can't)

75
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:27,000
(commit murder.)

76
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:34,639
(What's going on?
I haven't even started pursuing you.)

77
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,240
(Are you going to flirt with me first?)

78
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,160
(Why is Ms. Chi acting so weird today?)

79
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,879
(Has she)

80
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,480
(started to despise me,)

81
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,279
(His Majesty's illegitimate son?)

82
00:04:49,439 --> 00:04:50,439
(What are you doing?)

83
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:53,480
(He's so quick.)

84
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,319
Ms. Chi, sorry.

85
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,000
If you don't want
to work for me anymore,

86
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,639
I can let you go.

87
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:03,959
(Shen Zhaomu, you're doomed.)

88
00:05:03,959 --> 00:05:06,639
(Once a man
starts feeling sorry for a woman,)

89
00:05:07,079 --> 00:05:09,680
(he theoretically
falls in love with her.)

90
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,279
(Let me test if your lips are soft.)

91
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:26,480
(Let's lock eyes for eight seconds
and see if your heart flutters.)

92
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:31,600
What are you trying to do?

93
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,079
I can be more than just your guard.

94
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,399
Have you lost your mind?

95
00:05:40,079 --> 00:05:42,540
I'll meet Father first.
I'll discipline you when I get back,

96
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,420
(Shen Residence)

97
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:49,800
Greetings, Father.

98
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,240
Madam Cui.

99
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,560
(Cui Lanping
The Shen Family's Second Madam)

100
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,379
(Shen Yi, The Shen Family's Patriarch)
Father.

101
00:05:56,379 --> 00:05:58,839
This is the only copy
of Zhou Zi's Art of War that I found.

102
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,680
It's a gift to congratulate you
on your triumphant return.

103
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,959
General, here. Try this.

104
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:09,360
I made this for you.

105
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,759
Does it taste good?

106
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:12,879
Not bad.

107
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,759
Try this too.

108
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,279
Leave it here.

109
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:25,279
Lanping, how's the baby

110
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,759
feeling today?

111
00:06:27,519 --> 00:06:29,560
The baby keeps kicking me.

112
00:06:35,959 --> 00:06:36,680
Xin.

113
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,600
Father. Mother.

114
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,680
Father, Mother. Something bad happened.

115
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:45,000
(Shen Yi, The Shen Family's Patriarch)
You're a lady. Why are you panicking?

116
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,990
(Shen Xin, The Shen Family's Daughter)
Chi Yuan killed Mother's maid, Cai.

117
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,399
Fortunately, Hong escaped.

118
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:53,299
(Cui Lanping, The Shen Family's Madam)
How dare Chi Yuan kill my staff?

119
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,600
Take me to check it out.

120
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:56,519
Lanping.

121
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,199
Mother.

122
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,319
Mother.

123
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:58,959
Lanping.

124
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,480
Yi, I think I...

125
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,480
Get the doctor and midwife.

126
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,920
This is the hot pot I prepared for you.

127
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,120
I have no appetite.

128
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,800
How can I swallow this cold food?

129
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:18,120
(To win a man's heart,)

130
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,759
(I must first conquer his stomach.)

131
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:23,279
(Done.)

132
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,720
I'll eat it myself.

133
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,800
In this huge General's Residence,

134
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,439
you're the only one
willing to share a table with me.

135
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,199
You've been my guard for 13 years,

136
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,680
you're the only one I can trust.

137
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,439
I wondered
why something seems to be missing.

138
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:52,920
We need to eat hot pot with garlic.
It's tasty. Just wait.

139
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,879
General.

140
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,399
Young Master Zhaoyang died in infancy.

141
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,279
Father, you must get justice for Mother.

142
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,040
If it wasn't for Chi Yuan,

143
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
my brother wouldn't have died.

144
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,600
Guards.

145
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,600
General.

146
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:26,439
Capture Chi Yuan!

147
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,240
Hurry.

148
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,120
We have a problem, Young Master.

149
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,759
Ms. Chi Yuan has been taken away.

150
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,840
Let's go.

151
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,080
Ms. Chi.

152
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,320
You only came when I'm almost dead.

153
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,159
Without my order,
you're not allowed to die before me.

154
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,159
I thought you were invulnerable.

155
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,559
It seems that I misunderstood.

156
00:09:34,759 --> 00:09:36,759
You've endured
countless beatings for me.

157
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,279
(Favorability: 5)
You suffered.

158
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,919
It's good that you know.
Don't make me take the blame again.

159
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,759
How about I take you out to sightseeing
when you're better?

160
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,639
No, no, I'm afraid to go.

161
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,159
It's bad luck for me to be near you.

162
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,159
Rest well then.

163
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:06,720
Send this item to Madam Cui in my name

164
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,840
as a token of apology.

165
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:10,639
She almost got me killed last time.

166
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:12,159
And now you want me to seek peace?

167
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:13,240
It's necessary.

168
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,519
If we don't send this item,

169
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:17,840
we may face more troubles in the future.

170
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,039
You're so timid.

171
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,799
General distances himself from you.

172
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,519
Madam Cui and Shen Xin
keep picking on you.

173
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,960
All you do is put up with it.

174
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:30,879
Are you even my guard?

175
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,919
How dare you
disobey your master's orders?

176
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,120
Who left these flowers here?

177
00:10:50,679 --> 00:10:52,919
Chi Yuan, how dare you steal my stuff?

178
00:10:54,159 --> 00:10:56,799
What are you talking about?
I found this.

179
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:00,320
There's only one snow rose in Nanling.

180
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:02,820
I caught you red-handed.
How dare you make excuses?

181
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,460
Are you causing trouble on purpose?

182
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:06,960
You...

183
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,320
You even hit me.

184
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,000
How dare you hit me?

185
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,800
Shen Xin, you've gone too far.

186
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,039
Stop.

187
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:18,840
Mother.

188
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,120
Chi Yuan, how dare you?

189
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,399
You haven't resolved
what happened last time.

190
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,039
How dare you cause trouble again?

191
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,159
Madam Cui,
I was instructed by Young Master Zhaomu

192
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:32,200
to offer you a token of apology.

193
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,120
It was all a misunderstanding earlier.

194
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,599
Please discern the situation fairly.

195
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,260
(My Beloved Younger Brother,
Shen Zhaoyang's Memorial Tablet)

196
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,039
How dare you? Arrest Chi Yuan.

197
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,240
Why?

198
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,679
You stole Xin's flower

199
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,080
and used the tablet
to mock my pain of losing my son.

200
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,159
What a vicious woman.

201
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,099
Take her away, give her 100 beatings,
and throw her out of Shen Residence.

202
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,879
Looks like Madam Cui is recovering well.

203
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:01,639
Master.

204
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:02,360
Eunuch Quan.

205
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,080
Master.

206
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,799
His Majesty heard about your miscarriage

207
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,520
and sent me to offer his condolences
with some supplements.

208
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,399
Thank His Majesty for his concern.

209
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,360
But Chi Yuan

210
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,120
is the guard His Majesty
assigned to Young Master Shen.

211
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:23,639
If she dies and Young Master Shen
gets in any danger,

212
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,320
I'm afraid
neither you nor I can afford it.

213
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:27,120
Yes.

214
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,519
Since it's just a misunderstanding,
I'll take Chi Yuan away.

215
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,559
Madam Cui
is deliberately looking for trouble.

216
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,439
Instead of comforting your subordinate,
you punish me instead.

217
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:41,879
What kind of master are you?

218
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,799
Since you have no remorse,

219
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:46,240
I'll punish you to kneel for an hour.

220
00:12:47,159 --> 00:12:50,159
If you get up before that,
I'll kick you out of Shen Residence.

221
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:56,799
(I came to your world to save you.)

222
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,039
(Yet you punished me in return.)

223
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,960
Someone open the door.

224
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,940
(You made me
take the blame so many times.)

225
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,279
(It's time to punish you.)

226
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,360
Is Shen Zhaomu

227
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,080
going to piss his pants and cry?

228
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,159
Chi Yuan, I'm sorry. Let me out.

229
00:13:27,159 --> 00:13:29,960
I'll listen to you from now on.

230
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,679
If it were in the modern era,

231
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:33,840
the trending topic on Weibo is probably

232
00:13:34,159 --> 00:13:38,080
Shocking: General's Residence
Power Outage Tragedy.

233
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,559
The only son died tragically
because he was afraid of the dark.

234
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,080
Oh no.

235
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,600
He's not scared of the dark, is he?

236
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,399
If he dies,

237
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,519
what am I going to do about my mission?

238
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:02,879
Shen Zhaomu.

239
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,080
Young Master Zhaomu,
I just want to see if you're asleep.

240
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:29,720
I didn't do the rest.

241
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,480
(I pulled a prank on him,
but he wasn't angry.)

242
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:52,840
(Oh no. My heart is on fire too.)

243
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,480
(How can there be someone)

244
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,220
(who looks so much
like my deceased mother?)

245
00:15:15,679 --> 00:15:16,480
Do they look alike?

246
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,000
Look alike?

247
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,120
Do you mean Madam Gao?

248
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,799
Madam Gao has passed away
for more than ten years,

249
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:30,519
but from what I remember,

250
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:32,120
the performer in front of us

251
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,960
strongly resembles her eyes.

252
00:15:37,879 --> 00:15:41,200
Young Master Zhaomu,
we haven't drunk the wine.

253
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:44,080
Young Master Zhaomu, wait for me!

254
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,879
Mother, we have a problem.

255
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,399
You're a lady.

256
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:50,720
It's inappropriate for you

257
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,679
to cause so much ruckus.

258
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,539
Father brought back
a performer from Wangjiang Pavilion.

259
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,759
She...

260
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,799
She's also staying
at Rose Garden where Madam Gao lived.

261
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,480
How is that possible?

262
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,519
It... It's alright
if he wants a concubine.

263
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,600
How could he
bring a lowly performer home?

264
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,540
If word about this gets out, I'll be humiliated.

265
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,180
How are you going to get married?

266
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:09,960
Let's go.

267
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:10,279
Mother.

268
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:11,360
I'm so mad.

269
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,992
(Rose Garden)

270
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,240
How dare you

271
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:22,340
stop me?

272
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:24,759
General has issued an order
that no one is allowed to enter.

273
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:27,199
Anyone who forces their way in
will be apprehended immediately.

274
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:28,519
I'm General's wife.

275
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:29,879
We have a visitor.

276
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,360
I came to ask if she needs anything.

277
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:36,440
I won't meet her then.

278
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,279
Why use weapons?

279
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:39,559
Xin, let's go.

280
00:16:53,919 --> 00:16:54,639
Have you heard?

281
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,559
General secretly brought back
a performer from Wangjiang Pavilion.

282
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,559
I heard about it.

283
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,559
And she's also staying

284
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:01,279
at Rose Garden where Madam Gao lived.

285
00:17:01,879 --> 00:17:03,320
I heard that every night...

286
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,400
Looks like these two maids
are Madam Cui's.

287
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,640
