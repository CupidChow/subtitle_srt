=Episode 2=

14
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:03,960
Ms. Qin.

15
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,719
Your eyes look very much
like my late wife Gao Ruowei.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,799
She suffered all her life.

17
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:14,560
I can protect the country

18
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,200
but not the woman I love.

19
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,680
What do you want?

20
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,840
Do you have any ideas

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,560
to help me fall asleep earlier?

22
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,319
I do have a solution,

23
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,680
but you have to promise
not to get angry.

24
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,280
Tell me.

25
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,840
You promised not to get angry.

26
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,280
Forget about making me work overtime.

27
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,439
I've always been against
intense internal competition.

28
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,079
How dare you, Chi Yuan?

29
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,079
You didn't greet me when seeing me.

30
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,200
Hello, Miss.

31
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,760
Kneel.

32
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,800
You slave,
I'll punish you with ten slaps today.

33
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,000
Shen Xin, don't go too far.

34
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:16,800
I'll discipline you myself today.

35
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,080
Shen Zhaomu, you...

36
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:29,560
Shen Xin, you disrespect your brother.

37
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:31,599
I punish you to kneel here for an hour.

38
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't get up.

39
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:36,919
I'm not kneeling. Why should I?

40
00:02:39,439 --> 00:02:40,240
Kneel.

41
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:43,159
Just because I'm your brother.

42
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:45,960
How dare you touch my staff?

43
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,800
Ms. Chi, let's go.

44
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,400
(Has my pursuing worked?)

45
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,639
(Shen Zhaomu fought Shen Xin over me.)

46
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,680
(I'll reward you.)

47
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:08,680
Who told you to place spies around Mu?

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,400
You also spread rumors.

49
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:13,400
Yi, you accused me wrongly.

50
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,599
Aren't everyone around Mu

51
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:17,439
arranged by the palace?

52
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:19,639
How... How could I have placed anyone?

53
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,840
Is it really not you?

54
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,159
If I really did something,

55
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,759
would I be discovered?

56
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,159
I think someone

57
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,280
is trying to drive a wedge between us.

58
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,840
Forget it. Let's stop talking about it.

59
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,479
If this happens again,

60
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,439
I'll question you.

61
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,199
Yes.

62
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,520
Young Master Zhaomu.

63
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,560
Eunuch Quan, why did you

64
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,680
bring so many people here?

65
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,039
(Eunuch Quan)
General hasn't been to court for days,

66
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,319
His Majesty is worried about him.

67
00:04:03,759 --> 00:04:05,699
So I brought
the imperial physician to examine him.

68
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,759
I see.

69
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,460
Please help yourself.

70
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,199
Mother, we have a problem.

71
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,240
I told you many times

72
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,399
that a lady should be calm.

73
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,199
What is it this time?

74
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,040
Eunuch Quan brought people

75
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,959
to search the whole residence
under the pretext of visiting Father.

76
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,160
Let them search.

77
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:26,439
Yi is exceptionally skilled

78
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,399
in hiding people.

79
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:30,160
I'm not scared of humiliation,

80
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:33,319
but General is scared
of spreading the family's dirty laundry.

81
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,040
Mother.

82
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,839
I ordered someone
to poison the performer.

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,399
What a bold maid.

84
00:04:49,879 --> 00:04:50,839
Arrest her.

85
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,720
Spare me.

86
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,480
Eunuch.

87
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,759
I'm sorry, Eunuch.

88
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,480
The wine is poisonous.

89
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,959
Take her away.

90
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,319
Eunuch, I'm sorry.

91
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:15,879
Are you...

92
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,120
Yi.

93
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,680
Arrest Shen Xin.

94
00:05:21,439 --> 00:05:22,800
Yi.

95
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,279
Yi, we can discuss it.

96
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:27,000
Where are you taking Xin?

97
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,360
Take her to the jail.

98
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,240
Father.

99
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,360
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,240
Mother, save me.

101
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,000
Xin.

102
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,600
Ms. Qin.

103
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,879
You need to get well soon.

104
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:39,480
I still want to hear you play music

105
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,399
and watch you dance.

106
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,279
General.

107
00:05:42,519 --> 00:05:44,700
Madam Cui suddenly fainted.
She wants you to visit her.

108
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,279
If she's sick, go to the doctor.

109
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,399
Why find me?

110
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:52,120
Do I have to go over
every time she faints?

111
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,279
Growing up,

112
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,800
Father never beat or scolded me,

113
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,879
no matter what I did wrong.

114
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:03,959
Now, he beat me for a performer.

115
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:05,839
Madam Cui.

116
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,839
Your father...

117
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,680
According to the spy,

118
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,720
Ms. Qin hasn't woken up.

119
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:13,839
General also keeps guards in Rose Garden

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,040
and never leaves.

121
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,839
I've also gotten

122
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,240
the portrait you need.

123
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,480
Please take a look.

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,600
I want to see
what this performer looks like.

125
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,040
She made General so obsessed with her

126
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,399
that he forgot about court affairs
and abandoned his family.

127
00:06:27,399 --> 00:06:28,360
Open it.

128
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,360
This performer

129
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,480
and the late Gao Ruowei...

130
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,360
My position in General's heart

131
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,240
is worse than a deceased person.

132
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,279
How cruel.

133
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,319
Mother, don't worry.

134
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,160
She might look like Madam Gao,

135
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,480
but she's just a performer after all.

136
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,480
Father can't marry her formally.

137
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,240
Mother.

138
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,279
Be... Be careful.

139
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,879
Why don't we steal Chi Yuan's stuff

140
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:14,199
and find a guard
with a similar build to hers

141
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:15,360
to assassinate the performer?

142
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,360
After this,

143
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,680
spread rumors

144
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,639
that it's because Zhaomu is displeased
that she moved into Rose Garden.

145
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,560
What do you think?

146
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:37,519
Shen Xin still won't give up after receiving
ten beatings from General.

147
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,199
She even wants to pin the murder on me.

148
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,980
(Dear Grandpa, I hope you are well.
Please help me. Shen Xin.)

149
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,120
Don't worry.

150
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:47,519
I won't give Madam Cui and Shen Xin

151
00:07:47,519 --> 00:07:48,739
a chance to do anything to you.

152
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,720
Can I trust you?

153
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,360
I just took the blame for you.

154
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,839
(To Grandpa, Minister Cui)
It was an accident last time.

155
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:01,160
Send this secret letter
to Minister Cui's residence.

156
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:05,720
Hurry. We'll celebrate with drinks
when you get back.

157
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:22,319
(Mother, how are you in heaven?)

158
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,919
I have to enter the palace
in the morning.

159
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,600
I'll leave first.

160
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:37,480
Mu.

161
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,679
He's getting more and more confused.
Be careful.

162
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,320
You're a general.

163
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,159
Aren't you also powerless
to avenge Mother?

164
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,639
If His Majesty intends to harm me,

165
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:57,200
can I avoid disaster

166
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,720
simply by being careful?

167
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,759
You...

168
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,080
(Turns out it's his mother's
death anniversary tomorrow.)

169
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,559
(No wonder
he's not in the mood to drink.)

170
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,279
How pitiful. I feel so sorry for him.

171
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,960
Shen Yi.

172
00:09:21,039 --> 00:09:22,919
You're an important official,

173
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,600
but you hid a performer at home.

174
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,080
Aren't you ashamed?

175
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,860
(I plead Your Majesty
to investigate General.)

176
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:38,159
I do have unspeakable reasons

177
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,879
in what Minister Cui's
impeaching me for. However...

178
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,519
(The King)
I'm not going to defend myself.

179
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:45,759
Please make a clear judgment.

180
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,480
Shen Yi.

181
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,399
Your sin is unforgivable.

182
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,919
Drag him out and give him 30 beatings.

183
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,799
I'm willing to be punished.

184
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:54,279
You...

185
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:55,519
Thank you, Your Majesty.

186
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,159
You...

187
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,120
(I've been here for half a month.)

188
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,639
(It seems I have to take the initiative
to increase his favorability toward me.)

189
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,080
I hope he likes it.

190
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:14,480
Let's go.

191
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,080
Young Master Zhaomu, the carriage
is ready to take you to the palace.

192
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,399
I know you don't want
to enter the palace.

193
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,519
If you feel uncomfortable
with His Majesty,

194
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,600
you can smell this pouch.

195
00:10:36,919 --> 00:10:38,919
This pouch may be poorly made,

196
00:10:38,919 --> 00:10:41,279
but the smell of mint and licorice

197
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,519
is soothing.

198
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,080
(You can leave that part out.)

199
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,000
I stayed up all night
embroidering that for you.

200
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:52,759
Put it on for me.

201
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,600
Sure.

202
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:06,840
Be careful.

203
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:27,020
(Favorability: 20)

204
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,039
Let's go.

205
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:38,519
Young Master Zhaomu,
you haven't put on the pouch.

206
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,639
Yi.

207
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:45,559
How did you offend His Majesty?

208
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:46,559
It breaks my heart

209
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,480
to see you

210
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,200
suffer such a heavy punishment.

211
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,480
What did your darling daughter do?

212
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,679
What did your caring father do?

213
00:11:55,919 --> 00:11:57,799
How could you not know?

214
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,519
If I had known you were a jealous woman,

215
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,720
I would have put you in jail.

216
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,159
Yi.

217
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,279
What are you talking about?

218
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
Why can't I understand a word?

219
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,720
I already know the secret letter
Shen Xin sent to Minister Cui.

220
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,360
You don't have to pretend.

221
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,159
Scram.

222
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,799
I don't want to see you and Xin.

223
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,480
Yi.

224
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,399
You're really heartless.

225
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:35,679
My father submitted the petition
simply because he felt sorry for me.

226
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:37,639
But what did you do?

227
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,480
Our relationship over the past decade

228
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,679
is no match
for that of a deceased woman.

229
00:12:44,879 --> 00:12:46,879
I don't need you
to teach me how to do things.

230
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,720
I order you to go back
and have solitary confinement now.

231
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,799
You can't leave your room
for three days.

232
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:56,599
We have a problem, General.
