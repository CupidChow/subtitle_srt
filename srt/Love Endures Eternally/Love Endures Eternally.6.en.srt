(Where am I?)

15
00:01:17,959 --> 00:01:18,719
Ms. Chi Yuan.

16
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,159
You're awake.

17
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,079
Here.
Have a bowl of porridge to sober up.

18
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:29,439
What did you do to me last night?

19
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,319
I saved you last night.

20
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,920
You were quite drunk.

21
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,799
How dare you lie to me?

22
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,439
Last night,

23
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,320
Shen Zhaomu said
he wanted to end all ties with you.

24
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,760
You're no longer my guard

25
00:01:45,959 --> 00:01:47,439
from now on.

26
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,799
I saw that you were drunk

27
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:51,760
and had nowhere to go.

28
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,560
That's why I took you to my house.

29
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,239
Why do you want to kill me
after waking up this morning?

30
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,120
I have to go back now.

31
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,439
You can go back,

32
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,759
but you're always welcome back here.

33
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:25,199
Ms. Chi Yuan.

34
00:02:25,199 --> 00:02:26,680
I finally found you.

35
00:02:27,199 --> 00:02:29,599
Did you run away
because Young Master Zhaomu

36
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,599
rejected you yesterday?

37
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:32,680
No.

38
00:02:33,199 --> 00:02:34,520
I saw him carrying Shen Xin

39
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,199
before I could ask him

40
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,680
what he thought of me.

41
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,080
I left alone later.

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,680
You misunderstood.

43
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,039
Yesterday, Miss

44
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:44,240
tried cutting her wrist
in front of Young Master Zhaomu.

45
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:46,800
That's why Young Master Zhaomu
carried her to see the doctor.

46
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,159
Miss narrowly escaped death,

47
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,719
but Young Master Zhaomu
didn't even visit her today.

48
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,000
Has Shen Xin lost her mind?

49
00:02:54,443 --> 00:02:56,980
(Shen Residence)

50
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,799
Ms. Chi Yuan. We received orders
that you're not allowed to enter.

51
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,599
Why?

52
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,719
Yes, how could you
not allow her to enter?

53
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,120
It's the order we got.

54
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,919
Please leave.

55
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,599
Even if you step over our corpses today,

56
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,320
you won't be able
to see Young Master Zhaomu.

57
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,159
Ms. Chi Yuan. I think there must be
a misunderstanding between you two.

58
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,439
I'll explain to Young Master Zhaomu.
Don't be discouraged.

59
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:42,240
Chi Yuan, let's spar.

60
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,639
You can't wield a sword.

61
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,840
Why are you holding one?

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,599
I was afraid that you might be bored,

63
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:48,500
so I thought
I'd help you alleviate your boredom.

64
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,479
I am bored.

65
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,240
I know you're distraught.

66
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,439
Here. I can fly a kite with you.

67
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,759
And you can teach me swordsmanship.
What do you think?

68
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,639
No thanks.

69
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,599
We are mere strangers who met by chance,

70
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,419
but I'm scared
that you have nowhere else to go.

71
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,400
If you're willing,

72
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,780
you can stay in Prince's Residence.

73
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,280
No need.

74
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,280
It doesn't matter.

75
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:15,439
If you're willing,

76
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,619
you can come here
and find me at anytime.

77
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:38,980
(Shen Residence)

78
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:49,390
(Shen Residence)

79
00:04:49,399 --> 00:04:51,740
Isn't this Chi Yuan,
who's the Shen family's former guard

80
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,879
and now a homeless person?

81
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,560
Shen Xin.

82
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,879
Apart from using despicable means

83
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,720
to gain men's sympathy,

84
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,879
what else can you do?

85
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,279
At least I'm better than you.

86
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,759
Now,

87
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,879
I can dine and spend time with Zhaomu

88
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,480
every day.

89
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,800
Yet you can't even see him.

90
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:16,680
He must have forgotten you.

91
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:20,319
(Shen Residence)
Ms. Chi Yuan. Please don't cause trouble.

92
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,399
Hurry and inform Young Master Zhaomu
that Ms. Chi Yuan wants to kill Ms. Shen.

93
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,879
Do you dare to hurt me?

94
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,439
Aren't you afraid
that he'll hate you even more

95
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:31,720
and distance himself from you
because of this?

96
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,839
Shut up.

97
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,870
(Shen Residence)

98
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:36,639
You better kill me before he comes out.

99
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:37,639
Otherwise,

100
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,000
he'll only care for me even more

101
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,120
because of your actions.

102
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,839
You're

103
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,240
(Shen Residence)
just a slave.

104
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,480
Besides hurting people,

105
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,279
what else can you do?

106
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,040
Remember.

107
00:05:55,319 --> 00:05:57,000
You can never go back.

108
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,720
Chi Yuan.

109
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,519
(Shen Residence)
I bought you candied haws.

110
00:06:06,399 --> 00:06:07,879
Greetings, Your Highness.

111
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,360
No need for formalities.

112
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,480
Since we've ran into each other here,

113
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,680
let me introduce you

114
00:06:15,519 --> 00:06:17,720
to my future concubine.

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,920
You can call her Princess Consort.

116
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,879
(Shen Residence)
When I get married,

117
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,519
I'll invite you and Shen Zhaomu.

118
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,879
Her?

119
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:29,879
Your Highness.

120
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,839
Don't let this woman fool you.

121
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,720
She's fierce, cruel, and cunning.

122
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,519
Zhaomu kicked her out

123
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,240
because she wanted
to climb into his bed.

124
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,519
(Shen Residence)
How could such a despicable woman

125
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:46,560
be worthy of being the princess consort?

126
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,040
I don't know who you're talking about.

127
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:55,600
Your Highness.

128
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,439
Let's go.

129
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,240
Sure.

130
00:06:58,465 --> 00:07:02,340
(Shen Residence)

131
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,360
Young Master Zhaomu,
if your anger has subsided,

132
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,639
let Ms. Chi Yuan come back.

133
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:23,439
I'm used to seeing
Ms. Chi Yuan behind you.

134
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Now that she's gone,

135
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,399
I'm not used to it.

136
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:33,079
Once I've seen the vast sea,

137
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,680
no other waters can compare.

138
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:41,920
Other than Mount Wu's clouds,
no other clouds can compare.

139
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,199
Falling flowers and stormy weather
makes you realize that spring is gone.

140
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,079
Why not cherish
the person in front of you?

141
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,480
Greetings, Miss.

142
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,040
Leave.

143
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,240
Yes.

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Why are you here?

145
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,519
I told you

146
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,079
that

147
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:09,439
there's nothing between us

148
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,639
besides
our apparent sibling relationship.

149
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,399
Chi Yuan has already moved on.

150
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,879
She's going to be
a princess consort soon.

151
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,120
Why are you still indulging in this?

152
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,639
If you're willing

153
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:25,879
to spend some time with me,

154
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,439
you'll realize my good qualities.

155
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,160
What?

156
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,039
Would you like to
spend some time with me?

157
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,320
I meant the sentence before that.

158
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:40,759
The sentence before that!

159
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,219
Chi Yuan's going to be
a princess consort soon.

160
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,960
They'll send us the invitation soon.

161
00:08:46,019 --> 00:08:48,440
If you don't believe me,
you can ask the soldiers at the gate.

162
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,480
They all heard it.

163
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,120
Chi Yuan.

164
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,039
Why are you so sad?

165
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,039
Is the food not to your liking?

166
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,990
Your Highness, Young Master Shen
is outside and asked to see you.

167
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,240
No.

168
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,279
Didn't you hear her?

169
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:31,720
She's not meeting him.
Ask him to go back where he came from.

170
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,519
Yes.

171
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:43,380
(Prince Zhou's Residence)

172
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,540
Young Master Zhaomu.

173
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,840
Tell her

174
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,200
I'll keep waiting here if she doesn't come.

175
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,500
(Prince Zhou's Residence)
Yes.

176
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,279
Let's go to the market

177
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,480
and buy some accessories
or jewelry that you like.

178
00:10:06,799 --> 00:10:07,440
Or

179
00:10:07,639 --> 00:10:09,159
we can go to the hillside

180
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,919
and watch
the sunrise and sunset together.

181
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:20,060
♪Fate let me brush shoulders
with the person I long for in my dream♪

182
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:20,879
Chi Yuan.

183
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,679
Where are you going?

184
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,320
I'm going to ask him to leave.

185
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:33,900
(Prince Zhou's Residence)

186
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,320
Didn't you say
you want to end ties with me?

187
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,039
What are you looking for me for?

188
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,399
Do you not care about our bond?

189
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:48,799
Can our relationship

190
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:50,320
end so easily?

191
00:10:50,919 --> 00:10:52,519
I heard that you recite poems every day

192
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,799
when I'm not around.

193
00:10:55,039 --> 00:10:58,399
Are you and Shen Xin more relaxed
when I'm not around?

194
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,500
What does this have to do with Shen Xin?

195
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,919
You can't even bear
to hear me criticize her?

196
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:08,840
Our relationship
has nothing to do with Shen Xin.

197
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:09,960
Sure.

198
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:11,840
Please go back.

199
00:11:16,039 --> 00:11:17,440
I won't let you marry him.

200
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,519
Come home with me.

201
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,679
Do you think I'm a dog

202
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:23,039
and will come and go

203
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,120
as you please?

204
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,000
Put away your possessiveness.

205
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,600
I'm no longer your guard.

206
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,080
I'm going to marry Prince Zhou soon.

207
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,039
I'll become the princess consort.

208
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:38,639
Let me ask you one last time.

209
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,039
Do you really want to be
the princess consort?

210
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,360
Yes.

211
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,659
You didn't expect it, did you?

212
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,679
I'm a woman who can't recite poems.

213
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,960
And I'm not from a noble family.

214
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,639
Yet I won a prince's heart.

215
00:11:57,639 --> 00:11:59,240
Shen Zhaomu, let me tell you.

216
00:11:59,759 --> 00:12:02,840
I can live well without you.

just because he likes you?

221
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,720
You're the only one I like.

222

If you think it's glamorous
to be a normal princess consort,

223
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,759
I can make you a royal princess consort.

224
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,879
I can also provide you
what he can offer.

225
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:35,320

226
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:38,720
you like me?
