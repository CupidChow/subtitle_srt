Prince Zhou.

15
00:01:02,119 --> 00:01:04,640
Since you care so much about Chi Yuan,

16
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,040
I'll give you a big gift.

17
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,640
Let's see
if you're fortunate enough to enjoy it.

18
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:28,799
I was about to say goodbye to you.

You're tired
from traveling all day long.

22
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,640
Take care of your health.

23
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,560
Besides, you're pregnant.

24
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:50,760
Don't use force again.

25
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,239
I must find out
the cause of Qingyun's death.

26
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,560
I owe it to her.

27
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:03,640
Besides, I have to find
Shen Zhaomu eventually

28
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:04,840
and explain to him.

29
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,439
Yuan Yuan.

30
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,719
Why don't you understand

31
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,639
that His Majesty made you
Shen Zhaomu's adopted sister

32
00:02:15,159 --> 00:02:17,280
so that you can never get married?

33
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,759
If you want to save
yourself and the baby,

34
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,270
you can only marry me as soon possible.

35
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,240
If I can't find the murderer

36
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,240
and Shen Zhaomu and I
can't explain everything.

37
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,280
What's the point of me living?

38
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:37,479
As for you, I told you a long time ago

39
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:39,639
that I only think of you as a friend.

40
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,039
Is everything I've done for you
not enough?

41
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,479
I'm even willing

42
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,639
to accept this baby for you.

43
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,439
Why are you obsessed with that loser,
Shen Zhaomu?

44
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,759
I'm grateful
for everything you've done for me,

45
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,479
but there's always

46
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,280
an insurmountable gap between us.

47
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,479
Don't go.

48
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,639
You know

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,039
you can't stop me.

50
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:32,560
Chi Yuan.

51
00:03:50,919 --> 00:03:53,120
I'm sorry. I just love you too much

52
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,719
and don't want to lose you.

53
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,400
Your Majesty, Chi Yuan is already
pregnant with Prince Zhou's baby.

54
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,360
My mother is missing

55
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,719
and Father and Zhaomu
are in the military camp.

56
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,039
As Chi Yuan's adopted sister,

57
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,560
I once again beg you

58
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,159
to carry forward
Prince Zhou and Chi Yuan's wedding

59
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:17,680
to prevent their baby
from being criticized.

60
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,160
Chi Yuan is pregnant?

61
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,519
This is news.

62
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,519
Schedule the wedding
for five days later then.

63
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,959
I'll announce for the whole country
to celebrate together.

64
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,519
Thank you, Your Majesty.

65
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,199
I'll go back and prepare
for the wedding.

66
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,920
Eunuch Quan.

67
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,759
Investigate

68
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,199
if there's something else
behind Chi Yuan's pregnancy.

69
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:53,399
Shen Xin always has an agenda
when she comes over.

70
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,279
I want to see

71
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:57,519
what she's up to.

72
00:04:59,160 --> 00:04:59,959
Besides that,

73
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:05,000
I want to know why Shen Zhaomu
went to the military camp.

74
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,240
Yes.

75
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:23,759
Shen Zhaomu.

76
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,639
You'll rescue me, right?

77
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,759
Let me go.

78
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,439
Sure.

79
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,360
His Majesty has ordered

80
00:05:51,959 --> 00:05:54,959
that you must marry me in five days.

81
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:58,680
You'll become
the legitimate Princess Consort

82
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,990
and can enter and leave
Prince's Residence at will.

83
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,319
However,

84
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,519
you have to be obedient.

85
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,720
You must be hungry. Eat.

86
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,399
No!

87
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,519
What's the matter?

88
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,519
Do you not care about Shen Zhaomu's
baby who you're carrying anymore?

89
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,120
I won't spare you.

90
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,160
Speaking of which,

91
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:48,839
I forgot to tell you

92
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:52,519
that Shen Xin
has already killed Shen Zhaomu.

93
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,079
No way.

94
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,759
You're lying. No way!

95
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,720
Let me go.

96
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,920
Don't eat if you don't want to.

97
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:10,410
You can eat when you're hungry.

98
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:12,240
Let me go!

99
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:31,519
(I'm a guard.)

100
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,490
(How could I choke to death
on a piece of meat?)

101
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:36,759

102
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,360
(If you decide to take the risk,)

103
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,680

113

116
