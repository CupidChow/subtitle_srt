Everyone in the world

to be with me through thick and thin

00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,639
You're drunk.

31

34
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,639
What's the meaning of this?

35
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,159
Are your feelings for me

36
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,719
that vulnerable?

37
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,560
Don't go.

38
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,039
Drink

39
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
and recite poems with me.

40
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,200
Let's not go back to our rooms
until we're drunk.

Sure.

43

Do you really
want to make me angry on purpose?

Chi Yuan, how could you
think of me like this?

00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:12,759
I didn't do it.

68
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,120
I must go to the military camp
to find out the truth

69
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,759
and prove my innocence.

Go back and pack your belongings first.

75
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,040
Yes.

The food supplies for Three Guns Pass

77
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,570
must be delivered to the main camp
within three days.

78
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,040
General, your poisoning incident
has spread back to the capital.

79
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,879
The whole court is discussing it.

80
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,550
(We've checked the person
responsible for the poisoning.)

81
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,439
According to this secret letter,

82
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:38,140
Prince Zhou
seems to be responsible for it.

83
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,160
He wants to weaken
the Shen family's power.

84
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,279
Prince Zhou? How dare he?

85
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:45,990
If he's really
the mastermind behind this,

86
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,879
how can we
just wait around and do nothing?

87
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,959
No.

88
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:52,439
I have no interaction with him.

89
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,879
I'm afraid this was done
at the behest of His Majesty.

90
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,279
Well... General.

91
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,000
What should we do then?

92
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,680
At this point,

93
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,639
we have no choice
but to take the initiative.

94
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,879
Pass on my order.

95
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,160
His Majesty is ignorant, incompetent

96
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,720
and violent.

97
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:15,040
Prepare to rebel
against the imperial court.

98
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,639
Yes, we'll serve you

99
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,879
and follow you till death.

100
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,480
Your Majesty.

101
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,120
Don't blame me
for not considering our relationship.

102
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,559
How long till we arrive?

103
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:45,679
We'll be there

104
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:46,639
in about one day.

105
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,559
Let's leave after our horses have eaten.

106
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,759
I can't wait to prove my innocence

107
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:54,120
to Shen Zhaomu.

108
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,240
I'll make Shen Zhaomu
kneel down and beg me.

109
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,279
Chi Yuan.

110
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,840
Do you care that much
about what he thinks of you?

111
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,639
Have you ever thought

112
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,039
that if he cares about you,

113
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,039
he should stand by you
without hesitation

114
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,440
and fight against everyone,

115
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,880
