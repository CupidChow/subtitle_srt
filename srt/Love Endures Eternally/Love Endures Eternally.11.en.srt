14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,480
His Majesty said
that he had gathered many young ladies

15
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,510
and princes of suitable age.

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,150
I'm afraid His Majesty
will arrange a marriage for me.

17
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,981
You're already with me.
Why are you still going?

18
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,710
I can't disobey the imperial edict.
Sit down first.

19
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,230
Why don't you go to the palace with me?

20
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,190
This way,

21
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,480
you can lend me a hand

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,590
if there's any danger.

23
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,320
Alright?

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,800
No.

25
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,590
Is this for me?

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,760
No.

27
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:48,600
You say one thing but mean another.

28
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,480
If you accompany me into the palace,

29
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,000
I'll give you this jade pendant.

30
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,320
This is the only thing
my mother left me.

31
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,670
She said

32
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:11,360
it's for my future wife.

33
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,960
Who wants to be your wife?

34
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,440
On this beautiful Valentine's night,

35
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,190
I would like to have a toast

36
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,960
with all of you.

37
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,190
Everyone here...

38
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:48,670
Are you tired from standing?

39
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:51,190
I'll find a chance for you to sit down.

40
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:53,870
These women are dressed more gorgeously
than the other.

41
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,910
How can I, who wear cheap clothes,
compare with them?

42
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:58,320
Your parents have made contributions
to the country

43
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,710
and served the people.

44
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,920
You're worth it.
You're better than them.

45
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,550
I hope you can interact with each other

46
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,400
in this beautiful environment.

47
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,110
Perhaps

48
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,670
you'll find your perfect match.

49
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,920
Thank you, Your Majesty.

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:36,880
Prince Zhou,
are you 22 years old this year?

51
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:39,480
Is there someone you like?

52
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,190
Yes.

53
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,800
It's the Shen family's...

54
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,280
Not bad.

55
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:53,150
The Shen family's young lady
is both talented and beautiful.

56
00:03:53,510 --> 00:03:54,910
She's also from a prominent family.

57
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,230
It's a blessing for the court

58
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,190
and a celebrated news across the nation

59
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,110
that you have such a good match.

60
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,990
I appreciate your kind words,
Your Majesty.

61
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,710
It would be an honor for the Shen family

62
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,110
that Prince Zhou favors me.

63
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,400
Your Majesty.

64
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:13,960
I'm referring

65
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,190
to the Shen family's guard,
Ms. Chi Yuan.

66
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,510
Prince Zhou, what do you mean?

67
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,360
Zhaomu, please watch
your tone and actions.

68
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,230
Your Majesty.

69
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,030
If you could arrange
a marriage for me today,

70
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,800
I would be very grateful.

71
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:32,770
Your Majesty.

72
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,070
A princess consort
should be from a noble family.

73
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,190
I'm unworthy

74
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,480
and dare not aim high.

75
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:39,670
Young Master Shen, you're so anxious.

76
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:42,510
Do you also
have feelings for Ms. Chi Yuan?

77
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,400
How outrageous.

78
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:47,070
You're both members of the royal family,

79
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,880
yet you're arguing with each other

80
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,110
over a lowly guard.

81
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,070
How inappropriate.

82
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,840
Prince Zhou publicly proposed to you
in front of His Majesty.

83
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,150
Are you not touched?

84
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,190
If I like him,

85
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:18,440
won't you end up alone?

86
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:20,550
How can you prove

87
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,480
that I have your heart?

88
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,070
I...

89
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,510
I...

90
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,070
Ms. Chi Yuan.

91
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,670
My feelings for you

92
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,670
won't change
because of a fleeting remark.

93
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,070
I'll continue to pursue you

94
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,320
until you say yes.

95
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,710
The proof you want is here.

96
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,760
I will only be with Shen Zhaomu,
regardless of life or death.

97
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,000
You should give up on the idea.

98
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:19,760
That's right.

99
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,760
If you really want to be related to me,

100
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,710
you can consider my sister, Shen Xin.

101
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,710
His Majesty would be more pleased.

102
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,190
Who wants to be related to you?

103
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,710
Are you happy now?

104
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,800
Yes.

105
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,070
Let's go.

106
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,280
Do you think
Prince Zhou can sleep tonight?

107
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:05,670
Chi Yuan.

108
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:07,280
Chi Yuan!

109
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,480
Where did you go, Chi Yuan?

110
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,030
Chi Yuan!

111
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,030
Let me go. Who are you?

112
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,110
Prince Zhou, is it you again?

113
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,560
If you can't find Chi Yuan,

114
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:34,840
don't come back. Scram!

115
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,000
Yes.

116
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,800
Zhaomu, look.

117
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
This is the Valentine's Day gift
I prepared for you.

118
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,280
Take a look.

119
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,920
No thanks. I have one from Chi Yuan.

120
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,030
Please leave.

121
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,550
Why do you like Chi Yuan?

122
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,150
How am I

123
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,960
not a thousand times better than her?

124
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:08,480
Your flattery toward me

125
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,960
is nothing but a power struggle tactic.

126
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,060
If the crown prince
expresses his love to you,

127
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,840
would you still spend
all your efforts on me?

128
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,920
Your admiration and flattery of me

129
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,840
are just because of my background.

130
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,800
Chi Yuan is different.

131
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,800
She's willing to go through
fire and water for me.

132
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,390
Her love for me is genuine and selfless.

133
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,520
You and Madam Cui

134
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,190
never stopped adding insult to injury

135
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:38,230
when I'm in trouble.

136
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:39,430
Do you think

137
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,030
I will fall for you?

138
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,760
Since you said so,

139
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,800
I will respect you

140
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,190
and stop disturbing you.

141
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,680
After all,

142
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,560
I also have dignity.

143
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:56,150
