=Episode 12=

14
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,959
Master? Why are you here?

15
00:01:05,959 --> 00:01:07,879
The imperial court
is full of turmoil and changes.

16
00:01:07,879 --> 00:01:09,640
His Majesty has ordered to kill you.

17
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,040
You're my favorite disciple.

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,879
I can only take you away

19
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,120
to avoid danger.

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,040
His Majesty wanted to kill me?

21
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,239
Is it...

22
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,539
Now isn't the time to talk about this.
Get in the carriage.

23
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,120
Master.

24
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,120
I know you love me the most,

25
00:01:28,319 --> 00:01:29,959
but I have to go back
to the capital now.

26
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:31,719
You're asking for trouble.

27
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,640
If I leave quietly now,

28
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,879
who know what big mistake
Shen Zhaomu will make next.

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,879
I can't just watch and do nothing.

30
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,120
I have to go back.

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,840
You're no longer

32
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,719
the innocent little girl you were.

33
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:50,680
Go ahead.

34
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,920
But be careful.

35
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:58,159
Youngsters
will create their own destinies.

36
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,360
(To Father, Shen Yi)

37
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,039
Only when Shen Zhaomu dies

38
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,879
will you have the chance

39
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,479
to make Chi Yuan fall for you.

40
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,879
I can help you.

41
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,039
Would you like to cooperate with me?

42
00:02:28,159 --> 00:02:29,280
What's the meaning of this?

43
00:02:29,479 --> 00:02:33,159
This letter will allow you
to get Chi Yuan legitimately

44
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:37,120
and ruin Shen Zhaomu,

45
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,599
but only if you're willing
to join forces with me.

46
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:42,859
Why are you helping me?

47
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,719
(I'm writing this urgent letter
to report my safety.)

48
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:57,919
(I recently heard that His Majesty is ignorant,
and brutal. He killed the performer)

49
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,400
(and wanted to kill the Shen family.)

50
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,940
(The family is in danger
and the country's affairs are worrying.)

51
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,360
(I beg you to return to the capital
with the army)

52
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,240
(to protect the family and the country.
Turn the tide before the downfall.)

53
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,240
(The honor of the Shen family
is up to you.)

54
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,360
(May you remember your duty
to the nation and be resolute.)

55
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,039
(Looking forward to your reply.)

56
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,319
Is Shen Zhaomu trying to provoke
General Shen into rebellion?

57
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,080
Shen Zhaomu

58
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,599
is actually the illegitimate son
of His Majesty and Gao Ruowei.

59
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:28,120
He isn't related to General Shen
by blood.

60
00:03:29,439 --> 00:03:31,039
If General Shen
succeeds in his rebellion,

61
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,639
you won't be able to escape
Shen Zhaomu's control either.

62
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,360
If the rebellion fails,

63
00:03:36,039 --> 00:03:37,800
won't Chi Yuan's life be in danger?

64
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,400
The only solution now

65
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,599
is to hand this letter to His Majesty

66
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,639
to save Chi Yuan.

67
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,919
No, it's too dangerous this way.

68
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,479
Young Master Shen.

69
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,879
Your Majesty!

70
00:03:58,960 --> 00:03:59,759
Your Majesty!

71
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,599
I want to see His Majesty.

72
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:04,320
His Majesty is busy with state affairs
and cannot meet you.

73
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:06,639
Your Majesty!

74
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,680
Why are you doing this?

75
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,520
Your Majesty!

76
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,719
Alright.

77
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,159
Calm down.

78
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,400
I'll report it first.

79
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:15,400
Hurry.

80
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,920
Your Majesty!

81
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:24,560
Your Majesty!

82
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,959
Your Majesty.

83
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,399
Who

84
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,360
is making so much noise outside?

85
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:32,920
Your Majesty.

86
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,319
It's Young Master Shen Zhaomu.

87
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,199
He insists on seeing you.

88
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:44,160
Chi Yuan, why are you here?

89
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:46,759
I'm willing

90
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:49,319
to accompany Young Master Zhaomu
as his adopted sister

91
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,639
and never marry.

92
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,720
Chi Yuan.

93
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:54,639
Since you begged,

94
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,399
I'll allow it considering your many years
of service in protecting Zhaomu.

95
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,120
From today onward,
I declare to the world

96
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,639
that you're Shen Yi's adopted daughter.

97
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,040
Shen Zhaomu is now your adopted brother.

98
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,680
Your Majesty.

99
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,120
Mu.

100
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,040
If you think she isn't worthy,

101
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,360
I can send her to the borders.

102
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,720
Thank you, Your Majesty.

103
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,519
Chi Yuan.

104
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,519
However,

105
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,759
it's too harsh on you

106
00:05:27,879 --> 00:05:30,000
to never marry.

107
00:05:30,399 --> 00:05:31,399
I'll do you a favor

108
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:34,920
and choose a date to betroth you

109
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,839
to Prince Zhou.

110
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,560
Your Majesty.

111
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,800
That's not what you promised.

112
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:42,240
I've made up my mind.

113
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,560
Your Majesty!

114
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,920
Chi Yuan.

115
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,480
Why?

116
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,160
Chi Yuan.

117
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,199
Speak.

118
00:06:05,279 --> 00:06:06,319
Shen Zhaomu!

119
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,399
A lot has happened in these two days.

120
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:15,639
I almost...

121
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:17,000
Indeed.

122
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,959
My guard is clever.

123
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,720
She has now

124
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,720
transformed from a guard to a master.

125
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,879
When you become the princess consort,

126
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,120
I have to be respectful to you.

127
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,279
You...

128
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,240
Yuan, please...

129
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:50,700
(Favorability: 50)

130
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,439
My adopted sister.

131
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,160
You slapped me

132
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:59,160
but cried.

133
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,199
What do you mean?

134
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,360
Shen Zhaomu,
is something wrong with you?

135
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,120
Do you think you're smart?

136
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,399
Do you think you know everything?

137
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,519
Chi Yuan.

138
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,800
Chi Yuan.

139
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,199
From today onward,

140
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,759
we're not master and servant

141
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,240
but sisters.

142
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,040
I brought some gift
to congratulate you.

143
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,519
Once you become Princess Consort,

144
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,160
you must take care of us.

145
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,160
I want to find a place to talk to you.

146
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,199
I have nothing to talk about with you.

147
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,639
Chi Yuan.

148
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,800
Don't you want to see the gifts?

149
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:06,120
When Chi Yuan and I get married,

150
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,979
all these furniture will be replaced
with those made of golden phoebe wood.

151
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:12,800
And these pillars need to be painted.

152
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,800
Besides that,

153
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,079
replace their tea sets
with the fine tea sets I brought.

154
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,639
You're in Shen Residence.

155
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,360
You have no right to tell us what to do.

156
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,000
Young Master Shen,
we're here on His Majesty's orders

157
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,039
to deliver the betrothal gifts
for my marriage with Chi Yuan.

158
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,559
Young Master Shen,
it's His Majesty's orders

159
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,559
and a joyous occasion for both families.

160
00:08:48,559 --> 00:08:50,519
Please review
the list of betrothal gifts.

161
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,240
By the mandate of Heaven,
the king decrees

162
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,919
that Prince Zhou is an excellent man.

163
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The Shen family's adopted daughter,
Chi Yuan is beautiful and talented.

164
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,259
Their two families
are well-matched in social status.

165
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,919
They're the perfect match.

166
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,360
I now arrange

167
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:15,000
Prince Zhou and Chi Yuan

168
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:20,600
to be wed on September 10th.

169
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:24,000
Thank you, Your Majesty.

170
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,800
The Shen family doesn't need
these empty formalities,

171
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,320
let alone send Chi Yuan
into a tiger's den.

172
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,519
Scram!

173
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,039
Well...

174
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,240
Young Master Shen.

175
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:56,279
My marriage to Ms. Chi Yuan
is arranged by His Majesty.

176
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,320
It's legitimate.

177
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,320
It's a done deal.

178
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,639
I hope you'll allow it.
