Your Majesty.

17
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:08,480
Prince Mu
seemed to be in trouble recently.

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,640
Is that so?

19
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,120
Shen Yi has returned the capital.
How did he deal with it?

20
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:20,359
Your Majesty, General Shen seemed

21
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:21,740
not to take this matter seriously.

22
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,120
Prince Mu is just a guest at his home.

23
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:27,879
Pass on my decree.

24
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:32,120
Teach Shen Yi how to be a patriarch.

(Shen Residence)

27
00:01:58,120 --> 00:01:58,920
I never expected

28
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,760
that you're not only a good swordswoman,

29
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,280
but you're also attentive to me.

30
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,359
How challenging can life be?

31
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:08,159
As your subordinate,

32
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,120
it's essential that I take care of you.

33
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,680
I only hope that you're safe and sound.

34
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,240
Something's wrong.

35
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,639
Watch out!

36
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,080
Let's go.

37
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,479
(Ms. Chi.)

38
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,840
(You've risked your life
for me all these years.)

39
00:02:52,199 --> 00:02:53,919
(Is it because of your duty)

40
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,919
(or because you care about me?)

41
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,080
(Is it worth your risking your life)

42
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,240
(for someone who lives in darkness
like me?)

43
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,960
Go home first.

44
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,800
How could the guard leave first?

45
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,000
Besides, we have just been attacked.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,280
Are you not afraid
that there will be other assassins soon?

47
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,319
It's an order.

48
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,800
It's for your own good.

49
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,759
Forget it. I'll let you be.

50
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,240
(There must be something wrong
with the palace.)

51
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:37,639
(It suddenly made him
a different person. I'm speechless.)

52
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,800
Greetings, Young Master Shen.

53
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,660
His Majesty is waiting for you.

54
00:04:01,759 --> 00:04:04,639
(I embroidered the pouch all night
and even skipped breakfast.)

55
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:07,319
(I risked my life to accompany you
into the palace.)

56
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,840
(Yet he asked me to leave.)

57
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:11,240
I...

58
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,319
(No, he won't let me into the palace,)

59
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,879
(but I insist on following him.)

60
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,420
(Memorial Tablet
of First Wife, Gao Ruowei)

61
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,279
She's your mother, Gao Ruowei.

62
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,600
Look carefully.

63
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:01,560
You should feel gratitude,
longing, and respect for her,

64
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,759
not this perfunctory attitude.

65
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,959
I shouldn't criticize you
in front of your mother.

66
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,279
(I want to hear what secrets)

67
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:09,560
(his father tells him.)

68
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:11,959
She's a gentle woman who's a crybaby.

69
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,199
If I criticize you,

70
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,759
she will be upset.

71
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:18,319
And so will I.

72
00:05:20,399 --> 00:05:22,920
(He hit him. Should I rush in?)

73
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,399
(If I rush in and get executed,)

74
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,560
(I'll fail the mission.
What should I do?)

75
00:05:27,519 --> 00:05:28,519
Your Majesty, calm down.

76
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:33,439
Although your background
has made you suffer,

77
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:36,120
she gave birth to you and raised you.

78
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,759
You should only be grateful to her,

79
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,720
not hate her,

80
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,680
and certainly not ignore her.

81
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:45,720
If you hadn't run into us,

82
00:05:47,079 --> 00:05:49,199
she wouldn't have committed suicide.

83
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,120
You killed Ruowei.

84
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:00,120
So Madam Cui's baby is gone.

85
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:03,879
Why did you have to fall out
with her over a guard?

86
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:07,680
Her father is a minister after all.

87
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,800
You're right, Your Majesty.

88
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,240
You never called me Father.

89
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:18,879
We haven't seen each other
for a long time,

90
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,120
so stay and have a meal.

91
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,399
You're coughing severely.

92
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,200
You should take good care of yourself.

93
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,720
I'll dine with you another day.

94
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,720
Forget it.

95
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,079
How did you get up here?

96
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:10,040
I climbed up here, of course.

97
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,759
What about you?

98
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,680
I flew.

99
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,079
Guards are useful

100
00:07:20,079 --> 00:07:21,240
sometimes.

101
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,319
Does it hurt?

102
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,040
I miss my mother.

103
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:35,079
(Memorial Tablet of Gao Ruowei)
Your mother was an entertainer,

104
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,279
but I never cared
about what others think.

105
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,979
I just want to spend
the rest of my life with her.

106
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,639
Not long after I married your mother,

107
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:46,759
His Majesty assaulted her at the palace

108
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,439
during the spring exam.

109
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,720
If she were still alive,

110
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:57,480
maybe you wouldn't have to
suffer so much.

111
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,120
Chi Yuan.

112
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,079
Are you tired of this life?

113
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:05,240
I'm still interested in you.

114
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:09,639
I'm just annoyed
of always taking the blame for you.

115
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:21,600
I'm sorry for not protecting you well.

116
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:31,879
Miss.

117
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,159
Qingyun.

118
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,840
I have a question for you.

119
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:39,639
Did Shen Zhaomu
bring that performer home?

120
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,080
Is he trying
to ruin my parents' relationship?

121
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,600
Miss, I don't know.

122
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,360
Are you refusing to tell me?

123
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,759
