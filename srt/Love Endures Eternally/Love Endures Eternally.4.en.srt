Okay, please give me a moment.
Two bowls of Yangchun Noodles.

19
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,599
No spring onions and cilantro.

20
00:01:22,599 --> 00:01:23,480
Extra chili.

21
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,719
You have good taste.

00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:33,120
(Prince Zhou)

23
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,840
I didn't expect
we had such similar tastes.

24
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:38,120
Here, your Yangchun Noodles.

25
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,239
No spring onions and cilantro.

26
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,040
Extra spicy. Please enjoy.

27
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:44,840
Sure.

28
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,120
We even eat noodles in a similar way.

29
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:07,640
What great chemistry.

30
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,960
Yes.

31
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,599
May I know your name?

32
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,879
Chi Yuan.

33
00:02:23,883 --> 00:02:26,300
(Shen Residence)

34
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,319
Carry it out and bury it somewhere nice.

35
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,120
Yes.

36
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,400
Yi, I didn't kill her.

37
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,759
I'm innocent.

38
00:02:54,039 --> 00:02:56,520
Father, Mother and I
haven't been out recently.

39
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,680
We've been reflecting on ourselves at home.
Please have clear judgment.

40
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,080
(To Grandpa, Minister Cui)
Isn't this your letter of murder?

41
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,960
This is my handwriting,

42
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,280
but I didn't do anything, Yi.

43
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,560
If it was really me,

44
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,400
why would I
move the body to the pavilion?

45
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,879
Yi.

46
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,120
Anyone with eyes can see

47
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:23,479
that someone is trying to frame me.

48
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,599
Even if someone framed you,

49
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:28,000
you can only accept it.

50
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:29,759
From today onward,

51
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,840
Cui Lanping is unworthy of being
the matriarch of General's Residence.

52
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,159
But considering
that you gave birth to a daughter,

53
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:36,879
your merits and faults
cancel each other out.

54
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,439
You can keep your title.

55
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,639
From today onward,

56
00:03:41,039 --> 00:03:43,280
reflect on yourself in this courtyard.

57
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,120
You're not allowed to step out.

58
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,639
General!

59
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,400
Father!

60
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,280
I beg you

61
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:52,039
to spare Mother, Father.

62
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,639
Our bond of over a decade

63
00:03:56,759 --> 00:04:00,520
is no match for a mere performer.
General.

64
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,319
Mother.

65
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,599
What are you doing?

66
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,639
I'm almost done.

67
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,720
What's this?

68
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,519
A plane.

69
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,680
How peculiar.

70
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,000
Many, many years later,

71
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,720
even if you don't know martial arts,

72
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,439
you can board this plane

73
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,600
and fly to places far, far away

74
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,560
to see the stars

75
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,560
and meet people you want to meet.

76
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,800
It would be great

77
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,360
if I could fly to a place

78
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,480
with no hatred and trouble.

79
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,279
Here, I'll teach you how to make this.

80
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,240
When we're done,

81
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,639
we'll fly them on the roof.

82
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:54,319
Sure.

83
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,759
Do it this way.

84
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:07,959
The cocoon harbor old grievances.

85
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:11,360
The butterflies expect a bountiful year.

86
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,560
Endure rain and frost.

87
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:24,040
Ride the clouds and soar to the sky.

88
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,240
Zhaomu, after going through so much,

89
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,040
we finally achieved a small victory.

90
00:05:32,319 --> 00:05:34,399
I believe that one day

91
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,879
you and I
can be as carefree as this plane

92
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,879
and fly to anywhere we want.

93
00:05:44,399 --> 00:05:46,240
Sure, let's

94
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,519
fly.

95
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,460
(Favorability: 70)

96
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,879
Thief, let go of my kite!

97
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,360
Ms. Chi Yuan.

98
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,600
We meet again.

99
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,600
It's you.

100
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,920
Even if we have the same taste,

101
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,480
you can't take my stuff.

102
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,680
Is it yours just because you say so?

103
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,480
Before I get angry,

104
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,240
I advise you to return it to me.

105
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,240
Or there will be a corpse
at the government office gate tomorrow.

106
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,240
I didn't expect you to be so eccentric.

107
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,639
But you're much more interesting
than the noble ladies

108
00:06:41,879 --> 00:06:43,079
in the city.

109
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,319
But this really isn't yours.

110
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,600
Give it back to me.

111
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,079
Give it back to me.

112
00:06:49,439 --> 00:06:51,800
If... If you like paper planes,

113
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,360
I'll give you one next time.

114
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,800
But you have to give me this one.

115
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,439
This thing is really mine.

116
00:06:56,439 --> 00:06:57,560
It has my handwriting on it.

117
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,560
Why are you so unreasonable?

118
00:07:00,439 --> 00:07:01,240
Give me.

119
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:02,759
Give me.

120
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,000
What are you doing?

121
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,199
It's all a misunderstanding.

122
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,879
(Favorability: 40)

123
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:19,879
Greetings, Prince Zhou.

124
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,300
No need for formalities.

125
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,839
Who is this woman to you?

126
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,480
(He saw him holding me just now.)

127
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:29,600
She's just a guard.

128
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,360
What do you mean by "Just"?

129
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,040
That's not what you said just now. No.

130
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,360
Ms. Chi Yuan.

131
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,399
If you like it,

132
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,720
I can give it to you.

133
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,040
I don't like it!

134
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,600
Shen Yi, receive the imperial edict.

135
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,720
By the mandate of Heaven,

136
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,839
the king decrees
that the northern border is in chaos,

137
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,360
and the country is unsettled.

138
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,680
Shen Yi is hereby appointed
as the general

139
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,160
to lead an elite army.

140
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,240
Depart immediately

141
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,720
to pacify the border's chaos.

142
00:07:58,839 --> 00:08:01,600
I hope Shen Yi will serve his country

143
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:04,920
and return victoriously soon.
Best regards.

144
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,519
I accept the imperial edict.

145
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,720
General, you haven't recovered.

146
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,680
Please take care of yourself
on this trip.

147
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:22,040
You and His Majesty are like brothers.

148
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,040
Don't let unimportant people
cause a rift between you two.

149
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,920
On the day of your triumphant return,

150
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:29,600
His Majesty will welcome you
at the city gate.

151
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:31,480
Thank you for your concern.

152
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,000
Mu, I will probably be gone
for several months.

153
00:08:49,559 --> 00:08:51,000
With this token,

154
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,799
you can mobilize
all the troops in General's Residence.

155
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:56,679
Don't worry.

156
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,360
Take care.

157
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,240
When I come back,

158
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,679
no one

159
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:04,200
will force you to do
anything you don't want to do.

160
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:06,000
Including him.

161
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:09,360
Yes.

162
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:18,000
Reflect on yourself in this courtyard.

163
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,480
Father, don't worry.

164
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,240
I will assist Zhaomu

165
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,559
in managing the residence

166
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,000
and get closer to Zhaomu.

167
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
You'll be surprised

168
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,240
when you come back.

169
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,679
Xin has grown up.

170
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,320
No one wants to be close to you.

171
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:40,480
Let's go.

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,799
Xin.

173
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,160
I just took over the residence affairs.

174
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,159
Take care of these people.

175
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,840
Aren't you closer to Shen Xin?

176
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:17,159
Ask her to help you take care of them. I'm busy.

177
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,159
You're busy? Are you busy
joking and laughing with Prince Zhou?

178
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,559
What nonsense are you talking about?
Prince Zhou and I have only met twice.

179
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,360
When else have you met him?

180
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,480
What have you done?

181
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,360
I...

182
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,039
You...

183
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,039
It was the last time

184
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:35,919
you kicked me out.

185
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,279
I'm not familiar with Prince Zhou,
but you...

186
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,279
But me?

187
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,679
You...

188
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:45,679
You're under the same roof
with Shen Xin all day long.

189
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,009
What are you trying to do?

190
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,039
I'm not familiar with Shen Xin.

191
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,939
Hurry and take care of this.

192
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,200
Wait here.

193
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,480
Don't let anyone enter.

194
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,200
Call me if you need anything.

195
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,360
What are you doing here?

196
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:35,080
I've come to see your disheveled state.

197
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,840
Of course, I have something
more important to do.

198
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,080
It's to report to you
about the residence affairs.

199
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,200
Xin's nanny was sent
to the government office for stealing.

200
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,840
Your other dowry maid, Madam Chen,

201
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,799
has been fired due to her old age.

202
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,840
Chen Dapeng from the kitchen...

203
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,600
Enough!

204
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,480
I underestimated you.

205
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,960
I'm not done, Madam Cui.

206
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,200
You thought I forgot.

207
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,960
Just because His Majesty dotes on me

208
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,200
and I inherited General's title
since I was a child,

209
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,000
you torture me in every way.

210
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,000
You gave my favorite puppy to Shen Xin,

211
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,720
sow discord between me and Father,

212
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,200
and even threw a poisonous snake
into my room to poison me.

213
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,200
Have you forgotten everything?

214
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:33,080
You've defeated me.

215
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,559
You can say

216
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,000
whatever you want.

217
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,679
Madam Cui, you probably don't know

218
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,200
that I sent the performer.

219
00:12:43,039 --> 00:12:45,639
I'm also the one who sent
the secret letter to Minister Cui.

220
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,919
I just want to see
you and Father fall out.

221
00:12:49,799 --> 00:12:51,120
You unfilial child!

222
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,639
I'm going to kill you!

223
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,679
Go away.

224
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,200
You thought you can't defeat
the dead Gao Ruowei.

225
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:12,039
But you actually
can't defeat His Majesty.

226
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,799
I'm His Majesty and Gao Ruowei's child.

227
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,919
General is just my adopted father.

228
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,960
What did you say?

229
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,399
Chi Yuan.

230
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,799
Bring me the eavesdropping mouse.

231
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:28,720
Sure.

232
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,000
Zhaomu.

233
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:39,639
Zhaomu, you know me.

234
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,039
I have nothing to do
with Madam Cui anymore.

235
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,639
I'll follow your lead.

236
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:48,399
Madam Cui doesn't love me at all.

237
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:50,039
She only cares about her status

238
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:51,519
and thinks about having a son.

239
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,039
Zhaomu, spare me.

240
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:54,879
I had no choice.

241
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,879
Shen Xin.

242
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,200
You're so heartless.

243
00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:04,679
Zhaomu, look.

244
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:08,240
This is how Madam Cui treats me.

245
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,320
Don't call me Zhaomu.

246
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:16,600
Zhaomu, spare me.

247
00:14:17,159 --> 00:14:19,000
I won't speak recklessly.

248
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,000
Sure.

249
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,240
Only one of you

250
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:27,799
can live.
