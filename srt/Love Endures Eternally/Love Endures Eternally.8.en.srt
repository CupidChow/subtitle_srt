Did Shen Zhaomu
bring that performer home?

Was he trying
to ruin my parents' relationship?

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,799
Miss, I don't know.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,560
Are you refusing to tell me?

18
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,719
I'll shut you up forever then.

19
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,799
Miss, spare me.

20
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:16,400
I really... I really don't know.

21
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,400
Let me ask you again.

22
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:21,879
Did Shen Zhaomu
bring that performer home?

23
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,840
Miss, even if you beat me to death,

24
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:26,519
I still don't know.

25
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,599
Miss, spare me. Let me go.

26
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:35,040
Shen Xin.

27
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:37,799
If you continue
to treat Qingyun like this,

28
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:39,600
I'm afraid
Young Master Zhaomu won't spare you.

29
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:45,000
Do you think Zhaomu
will fall out with me

30
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,599
over a mere maid?

31
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,280
What if I tell Young Master Zhaomu

32
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,599
that you abused his maid

33
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,040
without any evidence?

34
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,200
What do you think General
and Young Master Zhaomu will do?

35
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,040
Qingyun, are you alright?

36
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:05,480
Qingyun.

37
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,920
Thank you for saving me.

38
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,520
I'm willing to do anything for you.

39
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:10,879
Get up, Qingyun.

40
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:15,479
Let me send you back to your room. Come on.

41
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,419
It's inappropriate for a guard like me

42
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:44,879
to eat candied haws in the street.

43
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,719
My guard can eat whatever she wants.

44
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,319
Don't worry about what others think.

45
00:02:59,039 --> 00:02:59,840
Is it sweet?

46
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,599
It's a little sour.

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,240
(What?)

48
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,840
(He's the one to take the initiative.)

49
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,680
(And we're in public.)

50
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:20,319
(What happened? I...)

51
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,120
Is this sweet?

52
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,080
Yes.

53
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,919
Young Master Zhaomu, let's go.

54
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,199
(Chi Yuan, I'll protect you from now on.)

55
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,879
Young Master Zhaomu.

56
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,039
This is the special meal
I prepared for you.

57
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
I want to share with you tonight.

58
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,280
Young Master Zhaomu, sit.

59
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:55,159
Our Chi Yuan

60
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,400
gives me different surprises every time.

61
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,199
Hurry and let me try it.

62
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:00,560
Here.

63
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,639
What do you think?

64
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,839
It tastes extraordinary.

65
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,040
Just like you.

66
00:04:23,319 --> 00:04:24,279
Here, try it too.

67
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:26,920
It's too much.

68
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,040
No, it's not.

69
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,800
Chi Yuan.

70
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,360
Are you alright?

71
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,319
I'll get you some water.

72
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,399
Give me a minute.

73
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,319
Drink some water.

74
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:01,639
Chi Yuan.

75
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,600
Chi Yuan.

76
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,720
Chi Yuan.

77
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:06,340
Are you alright?

78
00:05:07,399 --> 00:05:08,320
Somebody, come here!

79
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,560
Somebody, come here!

80
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,879
Young Master Zhaomu. I tricked you.

81
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,560
I'm a guard.

82
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:18,759
How could I choke to death
on a piece of meat?

83
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,879
I haven't been strict to you.

84
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,720
Now you're starting to trick me.

85
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,770
Young Master Zhaomu, here.

86
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,319
Have one too.

87
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,120
Ms. Chi,
here are the mushrooms you wanted.

88
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,600
I just bought them from the market.

89
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:33,519
Sure.

90
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,040
Sit down.

91
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:37,560
I...

92
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,399
Eat with us.

93
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:39,439
Try one.

94
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:40,920
It's yummy.

95
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,079
Thank you, Young Master Zhaomu.
Thank you, Ms. Chi.

96
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:47,120
Ms. Chi.

97
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,399
Did you really cook this?

98
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,879
It's so delicious.

99
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,240
Here.

100
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,959
Sit down and eat.

101
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,279
I have a gossip to tell you.

102
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,000
It's about you, Ms. Chi.

103
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,240
Me?

104
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,999
You're an evil servant
who bullies her master.

105
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:06,079
With you by Young Master Zhaomu's side,

106
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:08,879
no woman will marry Young Master Zhaomu.

107
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,959
They're afraid
that you'll eat them alive.

108
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,240
How am I an evil servant?

109
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,519
I'm a gentle, virtuous,

110
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,000
beautiful,

111
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:27,759
and polite lady.

112
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:37,079
Gentle, virtuous, beautiful, and polite?

113
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,000
That's right.

114
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,639
Are you

115
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:41,319
gentle and virtuous?

116
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,800
Young Master Zhaomu,
you've gone too far.

117
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,399
Alright.

118
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,399
Qingyun, how dare you laugh?

119
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:53,279
Continue laughing.

120
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:53,680
Miss.

121
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,419
Continue laughing.

122
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:09,879
Are you hungry?

123
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:15,360
I'll ask Qingyun
to make you something to eat.

124
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,040
Don't go.

125
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,959
I'm afraid that this is all a dream.

126
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,079
