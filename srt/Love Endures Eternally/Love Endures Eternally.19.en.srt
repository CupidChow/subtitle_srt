14
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,159
If you go back now,

15
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:01,240
you'll not only fall into a trap

16
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,479
but also become our enemy's weapon.

17
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,519
You've been unconscious for too long,

18
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:07,120
so you don't know

19
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:10,840
that Chi Yuan
will marry Prince Zhou in three days.

20
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:14,319
She's probably in Prince's Residence
with Prince Zhou right now.

21
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:16,319
Yet you're still thinking about her.

22
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:19,480
Mu!

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,439
Guards!

24
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,719
Yes.

25
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,200
Keep an eye on Young Master Zhaomu.

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,750
Don't let him out of the military camp.

27
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:27,319
Yes.

28
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:36,159
Shen Zhaomu
is His Majesty's illegitimate son.

29
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:40,120
General has been
raising a child for others.

30
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:50,120
Mother, she's hungry.

31
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:01,200
Xin.

32
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,680
Why are you following others?

33
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,000
Xin. My Xin.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
How could you follow others? Xin.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,639
This might be your final worth.

36
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,639
But what can I gain?

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,000
General.

38
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,000
What is she doing?

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,280
She's crazy. Move aside.

40
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,039
You servants.

41
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,919
Don't even think about poisoning me!

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,439
Stay away from me!

43
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,000
General gave it to me.

44
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,240
You've never seen it, have you?

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,080
General.

46
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,639
General.

47
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,080
Prince Zhou.

48
00:02:58,319 --> 00:02:59,719
Welcome, Eunuch Quan.

49
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,560
Please sit.

50
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,919
No thanks.

51
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,879
I'm here to visit Chi Yuan
on the orders of His Majesty.

52
00:03:08,199 --> 00:03:09,840
Please take me to see her.

53
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,319
Eunuch Quan.

54
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,520
The doctor said she's weak

55
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,479
and needs rest.

56
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,790
She's not fit to see visitors.

57
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,479
It would be bad

58
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,560
if her illness worsens
and the wedding is delayed.

59
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,960
Speaking of which,

60
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,199
you're welcomed

61
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,000
to drink more

62
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,560
on the wedding day.

63
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,000
Thank you, Prince Zhou.

64
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,319
I'll stop bothering you.

65
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,800
(Chi Yuan asked someone
to send me a message)

66
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,919
(and told me
that the baby she's carrying is yours.)

67
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,919
(She's being held in Prince's Residence.
Her situation uncertain.)

68
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:10,199
(I hope you'll come
and help me save Chi Yuan)

69
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,400
(on the wedding night.)

70
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:21,260
(Prince Zhou's Residence)

71
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,420
(Double Happiness)

72
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:50,160
Today is our wedding day.

73
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,480
I finally married you.

74
00:05:21,839 --> 00:05:22,720
Yuan Yuan.

75
00:05:23,399 --> 00:05:26,279
You're Princess Consort from now on.

76
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,959
Your Highness.

77
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:31,319
It's only today that I realize

78
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,170
how deep and sincere
your feelings for me are.

79
00:05:33,279 --> 00:05:34,560
I'm honored

80
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,920
to marry you.

81
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,920
Do you really think so?

82
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,079
Your Highness.

83
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,879
My hand hurts.

84
00:05:48,519 --> 00:05:50,920
You didn't need to suffer
if you have realized it earlier.

85
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,360
Chi Yuan, what are you doing?

86
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,920
I don't want to kill you. Let me go.

87
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,680
You chose the hard way!

88
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,480
Go.

89
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,439
Hands off!

90
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:55,319
Chi Yuan.

91
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,360
I'm sorry I'm late.

92
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,879
You finally came.

93
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,600
You suffered.

94
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,160
It's my fault
for falling for his and Shen Xin's trap.

95
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,319
Chi Yuan.

96
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:07,680
I treated you so well.

97
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,079
Why don't you like me?

98
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,800
How am I inferior to Shen Zhaomu?

99
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,720
I told you many times

100
00:07:18,519 --> 00:07:20,800
that Shen Zhaomu is the person I like.

101
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,399
(Favorability: 50)
You can't force everything.

102
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,720
You did nothing wrong.

103
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,040
You just fell for the wrong person.

104
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:40,000
What is right?
And what is considered wrong?

105
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,439
I just met you at the wrong time.

106
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,720
Chi Yuan, let's go.

107
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:08,480
Since I can't have you,

108
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,480
no one can!
