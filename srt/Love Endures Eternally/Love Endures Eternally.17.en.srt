Qingyun, wake up. Help!

19
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:10,439
Get a doctor.

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,040
I'll get a doctor.

I'll find the murderer

and avenge you.

00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,400
Young Master Zhaomu,
I need a toilet break.

31
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,199
Chi Yuan.

32
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,990
Let me send you back
to Prince's Residence.

33
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,199
Shen Residence is now dangerous.

34
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,280
It's too risky.

35
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,400
I don't want to drag you down.

36
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,120
I'm fine by my own.

37
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,719
It's late.

38
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,080
And you're pregnant.

39
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,520
How could I not worry?

40
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,560
How about you settle down
at Prince's Residence first today?

41
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,319
Tomorrow morning,

42
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,380
I'll enter the palace
and find Eunuch Quan for you.

43
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,840
What do you think?

44
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,919
Alright, I'll follow your lead.

45
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,280
Your Highness.

46
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,919
Thank you.

47
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,520
Thank you.

48
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:38,680
Miss.

49
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,120
Miss, we have a problem.

50
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,280
Madam Cui is gone.

51
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,410
Mother's injury hasn't recovered.

52
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,719
Where can she go? Find her.

53
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,400
I've searched

54
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,520
all over the residence,
but I still can't find her.

55
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,250
Send someone
to Minister Cui's Residence.

56
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,479
If they find Madam Cui

57
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:00,600
colluding with someone
from Minister Cui's Residence,

58
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,319
report to me immediately.

59
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,919
Yes, Miss.

60
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,560
Mu.

61
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,000
You finally woke up.

62
00:04:26,879 --> 00:04:27,680
Father.

63
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,279
You're not poisoned.

64
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:35,759
How can a little trick hurt me?

65
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:37,930
According to my investigation,

66
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,519
the people after us

67
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,879
are Shen Xin and Prince Zhou.

68
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,879
I thought it was His Majesty at first.

69
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,600
Who knew I raised Shen Xin
to be an ingrate?

70
00:04:51,399 --> 00:04:53,079
Is Shen Xin trying to get rid of us?

71
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:55,680
Chi Yuan?

72
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,720
The secret report said

73
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,920
she already knew your identity
and the contents of the letter.

74
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:03,199
She probably worried that the rebellion

75
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,519
will involve her,

76
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:07,680
so she struck first
to gain the upper hand.

77
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:09,240
Chi Yuan must be in danger.

78
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,319
Father,
please send troops to rescue her.

79
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,720
Take good care of yourself first.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,560
We'll discuss other matters
in detail later.

81
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,160
No.

82
00:05:20,879 --> 00:05:22,279
Please take action immediately.

83
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,800
Mu.

84
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,120
Mu.

85
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,040
Mu.

86
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,160
Mu.

87
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,879
Shen Xin,
how dare you break our agreement

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,160
and attack Chi Yuan?

89
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,959
Just like Shen Zhaomu,

90
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,000
are you hopelessly in love

91
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,120
with a lowly woman?

92
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,920
She was lucky

93
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,879
to escape

94
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,319
from being poisoned to death.

95
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:02,519
I warn you.

96
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,800
If you attack Chi Yuan again,

97
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,199
no need Shen Zhaomu,

98
00:06:06,519 --> 00:06:07,959
I'll kill you first.

99
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,319
Kill me?

100
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,000
If you kill me,

101
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,759
who's going to kill Shen Zhaomu for you?

102
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,480
If you kill Shen Zhaomu yourself,

103
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,560
will Chi Yuan be with you?

104
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,399
Chi Yuan has fallen in love with me.

105
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,959
She's pregnant with my baby.

106
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,279
Is that so?

107
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,120
Are you that confident?

108
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,519
Guess

109
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,759
who Chi Yuan would help

110
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,200
if you and Shen Zhaomu

111
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:54,759
turned against each other?

112
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,360
What do you mean?

113
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,920
Prince Zhou.

114
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,959
You're just Chi Yuan's savior.

115
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:09,199
She's just grateful to you.

116
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,600
Do you really think
you can replace Shen Zhaomu

117
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,519
in her heart...

118
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,480
Shut up!

119
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,399
You have no right to comment
on what happens between Chi Yuan and me.

120
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,399
Calm down.

121
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,120
As long as you're willing
to continue cooperating with me,

122
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,600
I promise

123
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,279
that you'll be the only one
Chi Yuan loves in this life.

124
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,720
I don't need anyone
to teach me how to do things.

125
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:39,759
We can continue working together,

126
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,480
but please stop crossing the line.

127
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,480
Prince Zhou.

128
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,079
Since you care so much about Chi Yuan,

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,480
I'll give you a big gift.
