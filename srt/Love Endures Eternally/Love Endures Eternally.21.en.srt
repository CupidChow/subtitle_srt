=Episode 21=

14
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,920
We must take action

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,880
to restore peace to Nanling.

16
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,599
We're willing to follow you

17
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,840
and create peace together.

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,799
It's unusual.

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,519
For the sake of the people,

20
00:01:11,599 --> 00:01:13,319
we must plan carefully

21
00:01:13,359 --> 00:01:14,319
to succeed in one go.

22
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,920
First, we must ensure
that the military's morale is stable.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,860
Then, divide the troops
into three groups

24
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:20,879
to attack the capital.

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,920
Time is precious.

26
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,000
We must act fast.

27
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:25,719
Yes.

28
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:29,690
May we succeed in our expedition.

29
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:32,170
May you be safe and sound all your life.

30
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:39,959
I hope our expedition will go smoothly.

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,480
If we fail,

32
00:01:42,879 --> 00:01:44,319
I don't want to live alone.

33
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:47,560
But we'll be together in the next life.

34
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,519
No need for the next life.

35
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,920
We'll be happy in this life.

36
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:06,680
For you and for our baby,

37
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,120
our crusade will surely succeed.

38
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,280
I used to live
in the shadow of my background.

39
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,840
Going against His Majesty

40
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,759
and alienating General

41
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,719
are all because of my hatred.

42
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,599
But since having you,

43
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:31,800
my life has lit up.

44
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,400
I'll fight for our love.

45
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,080
I also believe

46
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,039
that god will help us.

47
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,120
I believe you.

48
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,599
Chi Yuan.

49
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,039
Thank you.

50
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,000
Thanks to you.

51
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,719
I have a complete family.

52
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,660
(Favorability: 90)

53
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,180
(Shen Residence)

54
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:24,900
(Shen Residence)

55
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,919
Shen Yi intends to rebel.

56
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,639
The Shen family
is to be killed on the spot.

57
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:38,879
Shen Xin will be taken back
to be detained and await her punishment.

58
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,919
I've severed ties with the Shen family.

59
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,390
(Shen Residence)
You can't arrest me.

60
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,199
Let me go.

61
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,520
It's pointless to make excuses.

62
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,919
Wait for your trial.

63
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:46,879
Take her away.

64
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:47,360
(Shen Residence)

65
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,000
Arrest Shen Zhaomu.

66
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,199
Why arrest me?

67
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:06,220
(Shen Residence)

68
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,280
Everyone.

69
00:04:11,879 --> 00:04:12,919
This battle is important.

70
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,360
We must succeed

71
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,850
and eliminate harm for the people.

72
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,319
I never held my unborn son.

73
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,399
I want to create
a peaceful world for him.

74
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:28,040
May all of you return triumphantly.

75
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,160
We must win

76
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,100
for the sake of the people.

77
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,920
We're willing
to follow General till death.

78
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,759
Follow me and check out the terrain.

79
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,519
When I return triumphantly,

80
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,439
we'll have a grand wedding

81
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,920
to celebrate the world and our baby.

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,040
Before that,

83
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:04,560
take good care of yourself.

84
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,600
I'll wait for you.

85
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,160
You must come back safely.

86
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,600
Ms. Chi Yuan, please eat.

87
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,879
Where's Ruyi?

88
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,519
She usually delivers the food herself.

89
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,720
Ms. Ruyi knows some medical skills
and has joined the crusade with the army

90
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,360
to treat the wounded.

91
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,920
Take a bite first.

92
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:53,360
Someone tried to poison me before,

93
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,759
so I became more cautious.

94
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,920
Please forgive me.

95
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,560
War is imminent,

96
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,590
and everyone is in danger.

97
00:06:58,639 --> 00:06:59,240
Ms. Chi Yuan.

98
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,759
It's good to be careful.

99
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:02,959
Leave.

100
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,839
Someone, come.

101
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,199
Come.

102
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,920
You probably didn't expect it.

103
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:13,160
This poison is placed
in the most inconspicuous place.

104
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,800
Are you awake?

105
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,840
Where am I?

106
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
Why kidnap me?

107
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,039
Rumor has it

108
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,279
that you're carrying royal blood.

109
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,559
I was so generous

110
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,120
to make you Mu's adopted sister,

111
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,159
hoping you can behave yourself.

112
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,679
Yet you went against the will of heaven.

113
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,039
Is Prince Zhou not good enough for you?

114
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,519
Zhaomu and I are true love.

115
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:02,039
We're not bound by empty titles.

116
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,159
How dare you?

117
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,559
How dare you, a mere guard,

118
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,840
be with a member of the royal family?

119
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,240
Do you really care about Zhaomu?

120
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,159
If it weren't
for your behavior back then,

121
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,480
how could he
have been stuck in this chaos?

122
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:17,240
He couldn't acknowledge
his birth father.

123
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,600
His adopted father alienated him.

124
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,800
His adopted mother abused him.

125
00:09:20,679 --> 00:09:22,240
Who am I to make him

126
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,960
go down this path?

127
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,840
What a smooth-talking guard.

128
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:29,000
Do you believe I'll kill you?

129
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:31,960
Yes.

130
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,960
You're the king.

131
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,519
Killing a mere guard like me

132
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,799
is nothing.

133
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:39,559
Your Majesty.

134
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,360
We have a problem.

135
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,130
