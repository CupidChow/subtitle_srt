14
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,560
We just had two days
of peace and romance.

15
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:03,200
And now you're seeking revenge again.

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,280
Shen Zhaomu,
you just want to wreck havoc.

17
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,680
If I tell you
I'm seeking revenge to protect you,

18
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,439
will you believe me?

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,879
I will.

20
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:27,480
I didn't see anything.

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,280
I'm going to send the letter.

22
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:34,599
Go on.

23
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,079
Let's go.

24
00:01:51,239 --> 00:01:52,040
Chi Yuan.

25
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,439
Valentine's Day is coming.

26
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:55,990
How do you plan to express your love
to Young Master Zhaomu?

27
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,280
Express my love?

28
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,280
Forget it.

29
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,640
If you don't give him something
to show your appreciation,

30
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,640
what if

31
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,159
other ladies express their love?

32
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,360
He wouldn't dare.

33
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,599
Men.

34
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,000
You have good taste.

35
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,560
Let me introduce it in detail.

36
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,599
This brush

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,319
is our store's prized treasure.

38
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,639
What's so special about it?

39
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,039
This brush

40
00:02:57,039 --> 00:03:00,000
is crafted
from rare purple-gold feathers.

41
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:02,759
The brush handle is carved

42
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,759
from premium rosewood.

43
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:09,280
And it's inlaid
with premium South Sea mother-of-pearl.

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,639
Where's the pearl?

45
00:03:12,279 --> 00:03:13,000
It's inside it.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,879
Why is it inside?

47
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:16,280
Your hand won't shake when writing.

48
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,240
Not only does it look gorgeous,

49
00:03:21,639 --> 00:03:23,759
but it also has a smooth brush stroke.

50
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,759
It makes the writer's writing
more elegant.

51
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,319
Amazing.

52
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:35,399
It can be passed down through
three generations. The person is gone,

53
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,439
but the brush remains.

54
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,120
Moreover,

55
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,280
it can also enhance
the user's taste and temperament.

56
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,360
Take a look, Miss.

57
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:48,759
It's a good brush. How much is it?

58
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,039
Five taels?

59
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,400
500 taels.

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,520
Bargain with me. Come back and bargain.

61
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,839
How can you do business without bargaining?
Miss, take a look and bargain with me.

62
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,240
Five taels is all I can afford.

63
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,080
Five taels?

64
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,360
Isn't this Ms. Chi?

65
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,159
Why is a mere warrior

66
00:04:09,479 --> 00:04:11,960
also learning to pick out brushes?

67
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,240
What do you know about what's good?

68
00:04:14,639 --> 00:04:16,199
Are you itching for trouble again?

69
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,600
How dare you? Am I

70
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,480
not your master when we're outside?

71
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,600
Boss, I'll take this brush.

72
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,680
I chose it first.

73
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,759
Wrap it up.

74
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:35,800
I want to give it to Zhaomu,
whom I admire most.

75
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,900
You have good taste. I'll wrap it up for you.

76
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:45,800
True bond can't be measured by money.

77
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,279
Even if it's a gold-plated brush,

78
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,600
what use is it without a bond?

79
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,600
Chi Yuan, how could someone uncultured
like you talk about relationships?

80
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,480
I think Shen Zhaomu

81
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,879
is just tired
of young ladies from affluent families

82
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,040
and finds a woman
as reckless and fiery as you

83
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,639
to be somewhat refreshing.

84
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,680
Once he figures it out,

85
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
he'll abandon you.

86
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,439
At least I'm not like some people
who only steal others' lovers

87
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:13,999
and throw themselves into someone's bed.

88
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,560
They have no shame at all.

89
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,319
Qingyun, let's go.

90
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,560
Alright.

91
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,480
We don't know
who will have the last laugh yet.

92
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:36,220
(Shen Residence)

93
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:56,100
(Shen Residence)

94
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,000
Prince Zhou.

95
00:06:04,439 --> 00:06:07,560
I was just about to go to your residence
and send an invitation to Ms. Chi Yuan.

96
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,680
Are we going the same way?

97
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:10,360
Invitation?

98
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,300
Valentine's Day is coming.

99
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,680
I'd like to invite Ms. Chi Yuan

100
00:06:13,879 --> 00:06:15,079
to enjoy the lanterns with me.

101
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,519
Could I take a look at it?

102
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:18,959
Sure.

103
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,399
Shen Zhaomu.

104
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,560
What are you doing?

105
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,399
My guard doesn't like lanterns.

106
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,759
I'm declining you for her.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,360
No need to bother you to go over.

108
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,240
Shen Zhaomu.

109
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,839
Do you think
you can control Chi Yuan forever?

110
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,959
I'm telling you.

111
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:45,759
There is nothing I can't get.

112
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,439
I can easily

113
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:49,800
take your life,

114
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,199
not to mention a guard.

115
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,759
Chi Yuan isn't a plaything.

116
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,959
Not to mention you,

117
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,079
even His Majesty can't touch her.

118
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,720
Is that so?

119
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:13,879
Let's wait and see.

120
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,959
Let's keep a low profile.

121
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,120
Shen and Chi have the water radical.

122
00:07:37,959 --> 00:07:38,879
I'll write that.

123
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,959
Why are you here?

124
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,199
Would you enter the palace
and attend the dinner with me?

125
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,959
Why?

126
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:07,160
His Majesty said
that he had gathered many young ladies

127
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,160
and princes

128
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,959
of suitable age.

129
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,199
I'm afraid His Majesty
will arrange a marriage for me.
