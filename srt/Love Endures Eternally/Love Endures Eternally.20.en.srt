14
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,760
Since I can't have you,

15
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,640
no one can!

16
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,200
Leave immediately.

17
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,040
I can only escort you here.

18
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,519
Just pretend we never met.

19
00:01:50,439 --> 00:01:51,799
Thank you, Eunuch Quan.

20
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:54,400
Take good care of Chi Yuan for me.
Or I'll kill you.

21
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:56,120
Don't worry.

22
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,879
Hurry. See you later.

23
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:00,680
See you later.

24
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,560
I haven't explained to you properly

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,560
about becoming your adopted sister

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,439
and the incident with Prince Zhou.

27
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:22,400
Enough said.

28
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:24,719
I already knew the truth.

29
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,520
Chi Yuan, I did you wrong.

30
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:29,240
I shouldn't have fallen for their trick
and doubted our love.

31
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,879
You must treat me well from now on.

32
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,360
We're not going back.

33
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:44,599
From now on,

34
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:46,759
we'll live a simple life here

35
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,759
with our children.

36
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,360
Wouldn't it be better

37
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,560
if we add music, chess, calligraphy,
painting, poetry, wine and flowers

38
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,439
to our lives?

39
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,879
We can also have

40
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,120
five to eight children

41
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:06,759
and watch them grow up

42
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,039
and run around this place.

43
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,360
Do you think I'm a pig?

44
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,840
Raising children are expensive.

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,879
It'll be a waste of money.

46
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,840
Don't worry. I'll open a private school

47
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,400
to support my family. What do you think?

48
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,919
I'll open a restaurant

49
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,400
and sell some barbecue.
What do you think?

50
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,970
I also want to eat
the hot pot you cooked for me.

51
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:46,120
Tell me. Did you fall in love with me

52
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,360
the first time you ate hotpot?

53
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,240
I...

54
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:51,919
No.

55
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,390
You say one thing but mean another.

56
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,080
No matter what happens in the future,

57
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,159
I will give you a lifetime of happiness.

58
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:15,520
(Take timely measures to rectify
and safeguard...)

59
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:18,040
Madam Cui talked nonsense on the street

60
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,759
and ruined my reputation.

61
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:21,800
Calm down, Your Majesty.

62
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,639
I'll handle this matter properly.

63
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,600
Kill Cui Lanping immediately.

64
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,399
I want to tear her into pieces.

65
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,560
Cui Lanping has gone crazy.

66
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,000
Isn't that...

67
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,079
Eunuch Quan.

68
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:36,560
Are you questioning my decision?

69
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,560
I wouldn't dare.

70
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,240
I'll take care of it immediately.

71
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,800
I owed Mu a lot of time.

72
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,399
It's time for Mu
to return to the palace.

73
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,079
This is the sweetest. Try it.

74
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:09,759
Is it good?

75
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:14,639
I never expected Young Master Shen,
who lives a life of luxury,

76
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,360
to feed me fruit.

77
00:05:16,439 --> 00:05:18,199
I'm really lucky.

78
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,680
There's no Young Master Shen here,

79
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,920
only your husband.

80
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,399
What would you like to name our child?

81
00:05:40,519 --> 00:05:42,279
(Everything in this world)

82
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:43,439
(will stop.)

83
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,720
(The baby won't be born either.)

84
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,160
(If I don't complete my mission,)

85
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,000
(we can grow old)

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,040
(together.)

87
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,439
(But you in the real world will die.)

88
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,560
Do you like boys or girls?

89
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,639
I wonder if Qingyun

90
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,560
is reborn into a good family?

91
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,279
I believe Eunuch Quan
will find out the truth.

92
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,199
Don't worry.

93
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,560
Come with me.

94
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,079
You can't stay here for too long.

95
00:06:34,839 --> 00:06:36,639
Father, how did you find us?

96
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,879
His Majesty will find you soon.

97
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,079
With his ignorant and violent temper,

98
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,720
you won't be able to escape

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,790
if he finds out
Chi Yuan is pregnant with your baby.

100
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,639
Then we'll escape to somewhere further.

101
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,000
Everywhere in the vast world

102
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,439
belongs to the king.

103
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,040
Resist them.

104
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,480
Only by resisting

105
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:57,519
can we

106
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,720
and our children live a peaceful life.

107
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,120
Looks like

108
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,439
it's fate.

109
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,639
Even if you let go of your hatred,

110
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,120
you still have to confront him.

111
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,040
Chi Yuan, sorry.

112
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,360
I've got you involved.

113
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,360
In that case,

114
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,100
go back to the northern borders with me.

115
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,660
Let's take our time to plan carefully.

116
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,959
We can't stay here for long.

117
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,720
Let's go.

118
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,439
Although this place is simple,

119
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,480
I will make sure you're safe.

120
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,560
Just stay here
and take care of yourself and the baby.

121
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:01,720
Don't worry.

122
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:06,639
