14
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,399
Keep looking.

15
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,359
You don't need to come back
if you can't find her.

16
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:02,960
Yes.

17
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,439
Are you feeling well?

18
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,439
Since you're injured,
you should take your medicine.

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,280
You're not young.

20
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:21,200
Take good care of yourself.

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,560
If the Cui family
hadn't been unreasonable,

22
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:28,000
I wouldn't have suffered this. You...

23
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,359
You must have heard about it.

24
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,319
It's between you and your wife.

25
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:34,719
As a junior, I have no right to comment.

26
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:36,560
If only Madam Cui and Shen Xin

27
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,280
were half as sensible as you.

28
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,280
Don't worry.

29
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,760
I won't damage your reputation.

30
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,719
I will remedy this.

31
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,840
Don't worry about the rumors.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,439
They don't bother me anyway.

33
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,519
I just hope
you can take good care of yourself

34
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,000
and recover soon.

35
00:01:55,879 --> 00:01:58,599
Don't leave the house
if you have no business outside.

36
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,120
The rumors outside
aren't pleasant either.

37
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,760
Go back and rest first. I'm fine.

38
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:14,999
Young Master Zhaomu, the palace sent a message.
You are ordered to enter the palace immediately.

39
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Wait outside.

40
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,280
I'll go in alone.

41
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,479
Be careful.

42
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,680
I'll wait outside. Call me if you need anything.

43
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,960
Greetings, Your Majesty.

44
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,560
A lowly performer

45
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:13,639
charmed Shen Yi
with just a pair of eyes.

46
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,800
Just kill her then.

47
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,599
What's the matter? Do you think
that sending a performer to General

48
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:26,520
will be enough to deal
with Madam Cui and Shen Xin?

49
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,719
Since you already investigated,

50
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,319
I have nothing to say.

51
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,360
Mu, you can do whatever you want.

52
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,520
I gave you the right to do so.

53
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:41,439
But you can't make an issue
out of your mother.

54
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,520
That's my bottom line.

55
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,960
Since Mother died,

56
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,000
I suffered so much injustice and torture

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,599
from the Cui family.

58
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,240
Have you asked me about my grievances?

59
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:58,639
Or

60
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,960
do you expect my adopted father

61
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,719
General Shen to protect me?

62
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,520
If I hadn't protected myself,

63
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:09,159
I would have already been dead.

64
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,360
Ruowei and I have been in love
since we were young.

65
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,439
If Queen Mother
hadn't exterminated the Gao family,

66
00:04:26,959 --> 00:04:29,160
she wouldn't have been forced
to become a prostitute.

67
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,639
When I found her,

68
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,399
she was already Shen Yi's wife.

69
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,120
Maybe

70
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,040
you'll be a prince
who grew up in the palace,

71
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,680
or even the crown prince.

72
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,240
But you're our son.

73
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,399
This is your fate.

74
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,639
I accept my fate,

75
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:05,680
but I refuse to wait for death.

76
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:06,279
You...

77
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,439
Beat me.

78
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,879
You're Ruowei's child.

79
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,240
How can I bear to beat you?

80
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,560
Since your guard

81
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,199
took you to see the performer,

82
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:25,920
I order you

83
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,360
to kill her.

84
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,720
I'll then forgive you for this.

85
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,879
Your Majesty, this is my own doing.

86
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,079
I won't kill her.

87
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,279
Your Majesty.

88
00:05:41,519 --> 00:05:42,519
Why not kill me?

89
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,279
Don't try to irritate me.

90
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,040
Chi Yuan!

91
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,720
Chi Yuan, don't come in!

92
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,600
Zhaomu.

93
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,920
Zhaomu!

94
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:57,800
Have clear judgment, Your Majesty.

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,460
The matter regarding the performer
was entirely my own doing.

96
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:01,839
Please spare Shen Zhaomu

97
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,000
and punish me.

98
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,720
Sure, I'll grant you death.

99
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,759
Your Majesty, spare Chi Yuan.

100
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,079
I won't do it again, Your Majesty.

101
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,720
Mu, you must know

102
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,279
that I dote on you
because of your mother.

103
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,920
You should have expected this outcome

104
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,839
when you use your mother
to make a fuss.

105
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,279
Your Majesty.

106
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,800
To you,

107
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,279
a commoner
is as insignificant as an ant.

108
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,759
But if you kill Chi Yuan,

109
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,199
I'll die with her.

110
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:38,399
How should I tell Mother about this?

111
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,360
Zhaomu.

112
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,279
Forget it.

113
00:06:49,079 --> 00:06:51,160
I punish you
to kneel outside for five hours.

114
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:54,319
Mourn your mother.

115
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:56,279
Thank you, Your Majesty.

116
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:58,179
Let's go.

117
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,759
If we didn't meet Ms. Qin

118
00:07:08,279 --> 00:07:09,920
and plan all this,

119
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,319
perhaps the performer won't die

120
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,560
and I won't have to kneel here.

121
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,399
Although the situation
is out of control,

122
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,639
I don't regret it.

123
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:23,680
Like you said,

124
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,240
tolerating bullying from others

125
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,800
isn't a solution.

126
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,839
Don't worry.

127
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,800
Whether you're bullying others

128
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,399
or being bullied by others

129
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,079
whether you're strong or weak,

130
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,319
I will be by your side forever.

131
00:07:45,839 --> 00:07:49,800
People always mentioned
something about life and death

132
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,560
and holding hands

133
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,560
and growing old together.

134
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,920
But people have no say

135
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,560
in their own destiny.

136
00:07:58,759 --> 00:08:00,319
Our bond

137
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,480
is already written
by the gods from beyond the heavens.

138
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,160
I'm destined to be your guard.

139
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,720
Whether you hit me, scold me,

140
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:08,879
or treat me well,

141
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:11,879
I will be with you
through thick and thin.

142
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,120
(Chi Yuan)

143
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,279
(Thank you.)

144
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:25,180
(Favorability: 30)

145
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,399
Your birth father is cruel.

146
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,559
He tortured you like this.

147
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,519
How about I kill him for you?

148
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,279
He's the king.

149
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,759
What can you do to him?

150
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,759
But...

151
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:41,759
Don't mention it again.

152
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,600
(If I kill His Majesty,)

153
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:51,799
(will I die first)

154
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,359
(or will Shen Zhaomu's favorability
reach 100 points first)

155
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,840
(and let me complete my mission?)

156
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,960
(How risky.)

157
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,600
(If I die first,)

158
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,240
(Shen Zhaomu in the real world)

159
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,360
(will die.)

160
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,399
(Enough.)

161
00:09:08,879 --> 00:09:10,559
I think your name
shouldn't be Shen Zhaomu.

162
00:09:10,559 --> 00:09:11,900
You should be named Shen Daiyu.

163
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,360
You're so weak.

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,679
Sleep well.

165
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:17,960
I'll avenge you.

166
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,639
General.

167
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,200
Ms. Chi Yuan, why are you so sad?

168
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,240
Today, Young Master Zhaomu
was summoned to the palace. And then...

169
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,159
And then what?

170
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:41,320
Has His Majesty found out about Ms. Qin?

171
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,480
His Majesty grabbed
Young Master Zhaomu's hand fiercely

172
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,799
and forced him

173
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,279
to stab Ms. Qin repeatedly.

174
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,559
His Majesty also dug out Ms. Qin's eyes.

175
00:10:03,399 --> 00:10:04,200
What?

176
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,799
After Young Master Zhaomu came back,

177
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,639
he didn't eat, drink or talk.

178
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,039
He soaked in the tub for two hours

179
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:16,799
and became mindless.

180
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,240
General, my condolences.

181
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,159
Take care.

182
00:10:28,759 --> 00:10:31,440
Got it. Go back and take care of him.

183
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,279
Comfort Mu.

184
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,679
Don't let him do anything stupid.

185
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:36,480
Yes.

186
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,440
I have one more thing.

187
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,240
I don't know whether I should say it.

188
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,799
Go ahead.

189
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:47,200
Young Master Zhaomu
refuses to hurt Ms. Qin

190
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,080
and almost assassinated His Majesty.

191
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,679
Luckily, we managed to escape.

192
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,639
But I don't know if His Majesty

193
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,600
will punish Young Master Zhaomu later.

194
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I didn't expect

195
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,759
that a weak scholar like Mu

196
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,639
to be more...

197
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,879
Put Mu at ease.

198
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,399
I have plans for what happens next.

199
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,919
Yes.

200
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:17,559
I shall leave now.

201
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,879
Xin.

202
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:25,440
Mother, why are you here?

203
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,879
Here. Look. Which one do you like?

204
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,360
I like anything you give me.

205
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:31,679
This one then.

206
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,200
Here.

207
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,440
Xin.

208
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:38,759
I've arranged
a flower viewing party for you tonight.

209
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:41,000
Prince Zhou will also be there.

210
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,360
Dress up nicely

211
00:11:43,759 --> 00:11:46,320
and win his heart.

212
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,679
This way,

213
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:49,759
My position at home
will also be more secure.

214
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,559
Maybe your father will change his mind.

215
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:56,759
Mother, in your heart,

216
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,100
is the position of matriarch
more important

217
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,320
or the happiness of your daughter?

218
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:02,879
My dear daughter.

219
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,759
You're both important.

220
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,559
Besides, you've reached
the age for marriage.

221
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:08,919
You won't lose out

222
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:09,879
by marrying Prince Zhou.

223
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,919
Be obedient and put it on quickly.

224
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,799
I haven't recovered,

225
00:12:14,679 --> 00:12:16,080
and you're already so impatient.

226
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,200
I heard Prince Zhou
refuse to be an official.

227
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,000
He's neither a scholar or a general.
He's just a spoiled heir.

228
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,480
How dare you say

229
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,679
he's a good match for me?

230
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,759
Xin, His Majesty only has one nephew.

231
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:32,440
Even if Prince Zhou is spoiled,

232
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,559
he'll ensure
your lifelong wealth and glory.

233
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,559
Besides,

234
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,200
will you be happy

235
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,000
if you find a veteran general like your father
who guards the border?

236
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,120
Listen to me.

237
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
Put this on.

238
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,559
No.

239
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:45,759
Why are you so disobedient?

240
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,120
Get changed and dress up.

241
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,879
No!

242
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:54,000
How unappreciative.

243
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,759
Mother.

244
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,759
Is this how you love me?

245
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:02,799
Xin.

246
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:04,559
I'm doing it for your own good.

247
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,600
Think carefully about what I said

248
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:08,240
and reflect on it.

249
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,360
(You mean well)

250
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,000
(but it's for you, not for me!)

251
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,480
The three of them
are now fighting among themselves.

252
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,039
Everything is under your control.

253
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:29,759
I think you should be happier.

254
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,600
Don't frown.

255
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:44,120
What is there in life
that can make me laugh?

256
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,559
Now that we have chosen this path,

257
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,799
there is no turning back.

258
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,480
I was the one
who was angry at you for forbearing it,

259
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:03,599
and now I'm also the one
who is afraid that you'll be in danger.

260
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,440
I know
you've suffered a great injustice,

261
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,000
but I don't want your life
to be shrouded in hatred.

262
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,559
Stop persuading me!

263
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,440
Anyone in the world
can persuade me to stop,

264
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:19,799
but not you!

265
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:25,440
(If you decide to take the risk,
I'll accompany you)

266
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,559
(and share life and death.)
