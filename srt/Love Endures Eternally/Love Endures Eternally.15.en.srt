If he cares about you,

15
00:00:58,679 --> 00:01:01,280
he should stand by you
without hesitation

16
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,679
and fight against everyone,

17
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,990
even if the whole world
doubts you and abandons you.

18
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,280
Chi Yuan, watch out!

19
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,959
How are you?

20
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:37,719
Why take the stab for me?

21
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:39,680
It happened suddenly.

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,519
Don't worry about it.

23
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,840
We have to hurry back

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,799
and find a safe place to heal you.

25
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:48,840
Let's go.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,959
Alright.

27
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,879
You're alright now.

28
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,079
Bear with it.

29
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:05,480
Doctor, be gentle.

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,719
Bear with it.

31
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,280
Your injury isn't fatal,

32
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:14,280
but you need to take good care of it.
Madam,

33
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,360
Change his dressing three times a day.

34
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,680
Eat a light diet

35
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:18,960
and eat more eggs.

36
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:21,439
It helps with healing his injury.

37
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,240
Doctor.

38
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,240
I'm not...

39
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,039
Thank you, Doctor.

40
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,479
Thank you, Doctor.

41
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,280
Your Highness,
you took a stab for me today.

42
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:40,879
I'll keep it

43
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,800
in mind.

44
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:46,400
Here.

45
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:52,439
Chi Yuan.

46
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,439
I often wonder

47
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,520
whether I can replace Shen Zhaomu

48
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,439
if I have met you earlier.

49
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,400
Whether he appears earlier or later,

50
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,759
I'll fall in love with him.

51
00:03:07,919 --> 00:03:11,960
My meeting, separation,
love and hatred with him

52
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,639
are all gifts from God.

53
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,760
It doesn't matter if we get a lifetime
or a short sweet time together.

54
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,520
From the moment I fell for him,

55
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,560
it doesn't matter

56
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,199
if others are good.

57
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,879
It's fine.

58
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:29,919
You'll find your true love.

59
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,080
I already met her.

60
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,000
What did you say?

61
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,759
Chi Yuan, go back to the military camp.

62
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:40,719
Don't worry about me.

63
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,280
I can take care of myself.

64
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,520
No, you got hurt because of me.

65
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,960
I can't leave you alone.

66
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,879
It doesn't matter. I...

67
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:50,639
Stop talking.

68
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,080
Drink some porridge.

69
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,080
Do you want a room?

70
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,759
Two good rooms for tonight.

71
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:07,039
Sure, I'll arrange it for you.

72
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:09,110
We'll reach the military camp
tomorrow night, right?

73
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,039
Alright. That way, please.

74
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,560
Take care.

75
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,879
Qingyun?

76
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,920
Why are you here?

77
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,959
Young Master Zhaomu
wants to catch up with you,

78
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,480
find out the truth, and find you.

79
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,639
Hasn't he pinned
the blame of poisoning General

80
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,879
on me?

81
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,079
Why bother?

82
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,040
I'll investigate it myself.

83
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,959
If there's proof that she poisoned him,

84
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,279
I'll punish her according to the law.

85
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,920
Young Master Zhaomu, Miss.

86
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,360
You two have feelings for each other.

87
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,040
Why are you so harsh toward each other?

88
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:55,920
How have you been lately?

89
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,160
I was so worried.

90
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:02,830
How about having a meal together
after we put away our belongings?

91
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,160
Sure.

92
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,040
No need.

93
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:07,519
Indeed.

94
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,480
I'm just here to get some porridge

95
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,920
for Young Master Zhou.

96
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,639
You're not even Princess Consort yet.

97
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:17,240
And you're already so virtuous.

98
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
How impressive.

99
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,879
At least Young Master Zhou
isn't like some people.

100
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,839
At least he knows what trust is.

101
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,360
Ms. Chi Yuan.

102
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,319
How about I accompany you?

103
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,759
Sure, let's get porridge
for Young Master Zhou together.

104
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:05,399
What are you doing here?

105
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,439
I...

106
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,639
Shouldn't you
be accompanying Prince Zhou?

107
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,759
I'm just worried
that it would be dangerous

108
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,839
for you to walk alone.

109
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,680
I just came out to stargaze.

110
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:24,120
I also don't want to hear
any more explanations from you.

111
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,399
I can investigate it myself.

112
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,680
I didn't plan to explain to you either.

113
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:36,240
Why are you still following me?

114
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:40,000
The starry sky isn't yours alone.

115
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,519
What's wrong with me admiring it?

116
00:07:08,879 --> 00:07:11,199
Are you the Chi Yuan I know?

117
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,439
You hit me again.

118
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:18,319
Do you think I can still trust you?

119
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,519
I don't know.

120
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,879
(Favorability: 30)
I'll trust you one more time.

121
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,000
My legs are numb.

122
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,040
I can't stand.

123
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,560
Do you want me to carry you on my back?

124
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,759
Hold me.

125
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:49,720
Don't let Shen Zhaomu
get to the military camp alive.

126
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,759
Let alone
let him return to the capital alive.

127
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,319
If you meet Chi Yuan on the way,

128
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,000
kill her as well.
