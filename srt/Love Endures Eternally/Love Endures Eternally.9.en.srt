Zhaomu!

16
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:28,439
I bought you some clothes and jewelry.

17
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:29,840
See if you like them.

18
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:34,760
Do you like them?

19
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:39,079
Ms. Chi Yuan.

20
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:41,439
Let me dress you up.

21
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,280
Ms. Chi Yuan, you're so pretty,

22
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,999
His Majesty ordered us to arrest Chi Yuan
and bring her to the palace.

23
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:31,439
How dare you?

24
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,120
We're just following orders.

25
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:36,039
Why are you arresting me?

26
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,240
I don't know,

27
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,840
but please come with us.

28
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:41,639
I'll go with you.

29
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,240
Chi Yuan.

30
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,319
Someone reported

31
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,280
that you, a Nanling woman,

32
00:02:56,039 --> 00:02:57,520
violated the law

33
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,039
and had an affair

34
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,560
before you're married.

35
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,840
As Mu's guard,
you know the law but broke it anyway.

36
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:06,840
It's an insult
to the Shen family and the royal family.

37
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,560
What do you have to say in defense?

38
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:13,840
Your Majesty, I wonder who reported it.

39
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:15,840
I want to confront them.

40
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,339
Besides,
what proof does the informant have

41
00:03:19,339 --> 00:03:20,680
to accuse me of having an affair?

42
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,919
You want proof?

43
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,879
Eunuch Quan.

44
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:26,479
Get her water for the body inspection.

45
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,520
Yes.

46
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,680
Your Majesty, I...

47
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,919
This is not up to you.

48
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,840
I won't allow you

49
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,479
to have such a dirty woman around you.

50
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,599
(Is this the legendary
blood body inspection?)

51
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,579
(It is said
that if the blood coagulates in water,)

52
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,639
(it proves that the woman is a virgin.)

53
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,599
(Otherwise, she'll be considered
as having an affair.)

54
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,719
It's not scientifically logical.

55
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,319
The proof is conclusive.

56
00:04:11,479 --> 00:04:12,280
No need to say more.

57
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,240
Throw Chi Yuan into the river!

58
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,719
Father.

59
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:19,720
Chi Yuan is my woman.

60
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,439
I want to marry her.

61
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:22,480
How inappropriate.

62
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,680
You're my son... my adopted son

63
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,519
and Shen Yi's son.

64
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,759
You can't mess around
with your marriage.

65
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:35,120
Chi Yuan seduced her master
and isn't virtuous.

66
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,439
We must get rid of her.

67
00:04:36,839 --> 00:04:39,319
How is your actions humane?

68
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,920
I'm just learning from you.

69
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,759
How dare you openly slander me?

70
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,179
Your Majesty, calm down.

71
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,079
Young Master Zhaomu and I are innocent.

72
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,999
There's something wrong with this water.

73
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,800
I want to fetch the water myself

74
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,759
and check my body again.

75
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,839
If the result is the same as last time,

76
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,000
I'm willing to die.

77
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,920
Chi Yuan.

78
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:01,800
Don't.

79
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,120
Sure.

80
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,199
I'll allow it.

81
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:27,879
(In that case,)

82
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:30,360
(I can only defeat feudalism
with science.)

83
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,400
(Here's some blood coagulating herb.)

84
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,839
(We'll have a good show soon.)

85
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,839
Your Majesty, look. I'm innocent.

86
00:06:10,399 --> 00:06:13,079
Someone must have tampered
with the water earlier.

87
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,360
You're busy with state affairs.

88
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,279
Don't let a mere guard

89
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:17,920
bother you.

90
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,560
I beg you

91
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,000
to let me bring Chi Yuan home
since she has worked for me for over ten years.

92
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,480
Forget it.

93
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,920
This matter ends here

94
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,199
Leave.

95
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,780
You have clear judgment.
Thank you, Your Majesty.

96
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,480
Father.

97
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,639
I want to know who's the troublemaker.

98
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,000
Summon Shen Xin.

99
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,480
Summon Shen Xin.

100
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,519
Greetings, Your Majesty.

101
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,160
Kneel.

102
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:52,200
You spread rumors
that caused others serious trouble.

103
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:56,040
Your father fought for the country,
so I won't punish you too severely.

104
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,719
But I'll give you a minor punishment
to teach you a lesson.

105
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:01,000
I punish you
to copy Women's Virtue 50 times

106
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,199
and reflect on your mistakes.

107
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:02,879
Your Majesty.

108
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:03,480
Enough.

109
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:07,759
I will investigate
this matter thoroughly.

110
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,279
That's all for now. Leave.

111
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,040
Yes.

112
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,279
You have clear judgment, Your Majesty.

113
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,860
You want to set me up?
You harmed others and yourself instead.

114
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,519
Send this.

115
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:46,439
What did you tell General?
The letter is so thick.

116
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,160
Although today's incident is over,

117
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,560
there may be trouble in the future.

118
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,360
I want to remind Father

119
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:55,639
not to forget
his old grudge with His Majesty.

120
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,240
I hope he can stir something up
in the northern border.

121
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,560
We just had two days
of peace and romance.

122
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,040
And now you're seeking revenge again.

123
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:10,160
Shen Zhaomu,
you just want to wreck havoc.

124
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:18,680
If I tell you
I'm seeking revenge to protect you,

125
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,439
