Don't let Shen Zhaomu
get to the military camp alive.

Let alone
let him return to the capital alive.

If you meet Chi Yuan on the way,

17
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,480
kill her as well.

18
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:17,480
You'll be rewarded handsomely
after you succeed.

19
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,640
Ms. Shen, don't worry.

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,879
I've never failed.

21
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,599
Young Master Zhaomu,we can leave now.

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,200
Tell Chi Yuan

23
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:44,640
to go to the military camp with me

24
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,920
to prove her innocence
if she has nothing to hide.

25
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,599
I'll wait for you at the door.

26
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,640
Yes.

27
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:59,319
Give me.

28
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,120
Stop yanking at me.

29
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,200
I can't leave
the injured Prince Zhou alone.

30
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,599
You can leave.

31
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:07,200
Besides, I have a clear conscience.

32
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,719
Once Shen Zhaomu finds out,

33
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,520
he'll come back and beg me.

34
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,319
You can leave.

35
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:14,520
You have to come with me
to explain to Young Master Zhaomu.

36
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,520
I'm not going.

37
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,439
Stop yanking at me.

38
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:22,719
Forget it.

39
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,639
It's all fate.

40
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,159
It's all fate.

41
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:30,400
Just go with the flow.

42
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:33,360
Sure, let's go with the flow.

43
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,240
We have a problem.

44
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,159
Ms. Chi Yuan fainted.

45
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,120
I'm a doctor.

46
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,360
Come with me.

47
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,919
What are you doing?

48
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:03,190
I'll settle the score with you later.

49
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:10,159
Doctor, what do you mean by this?

50
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,319
Congratulations, Madam.

51
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,400
You're pregnant.

52
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:32,240
Doctor, let me see you to the door.
Let's go.

53
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,000
(He's going to be a father.)

54
00:03:37,879 --> 00:03:39,039
(Is it my baby?)

55
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,240
(Impossible.)

56
00:03:40,919 --> 00:03:41,960
(If it's mine,)

57
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,199
(she won't abandon me
and be with Prince Zhou.)

58
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:47,080
Did you sleep with Prince Zhou

59
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:49,360
when you were at Prince's Residence?

60
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,639
Shen Xin

61
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:56,319
said you weren't a virgin
in front of His Majesty,

62
00:03:56,919 --> 00:03:58,960
and I foolishly defended you.

63
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,560
Come to think of it,

64
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,719
I was ridiculous.

65
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:07,639
How many things are you hiding from me?

66
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,240
If you don't believe me,

67
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,759
why ask?

68
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:15,639
I just want you to tell me

69
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:17,279
who is the baby's father.

70
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,120
Chi Yuan.

71
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,879
Chi Yuan, you're pregnant.

72
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,639
It's good news.

73
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:30,480
You must take good care of yourself.

74
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,040
Don't just take care of me.

75
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:33,839
Hands off!

76
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,439
No.

77
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,560
I'll take good care of you

78
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,079
and myself.

79
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,199
I'll kill you!

80
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,959
My guard

81
00:04:57,319 --> 00:05:00,399
is helping an outsider go against me.

82
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,519
No.

83
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,639
You're Princess Consort now.

84
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:08,639
(Favorability: 0)

85
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,040
I'm the outsider.

86
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,290
(I don't blame you
for misunderstanding me.)

87
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,879
(I had no choice but to lie to you.)

88
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,879
(When I find out the truth,)

89
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:31,480
(I will tell you in person
that the baby is yours.)

90
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,600
According to Nanling's law,

91
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,920
you will be thrown into the river
for getting pregnant out of wedlock.

92
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:41,519
I know

93
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,959
the baby is his,

94
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,399
But due to your identity

95
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,360
and pressure from His Majesty,

96
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,519
I'm willing to marry you

97
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,500
as soon as possible
to keep you and the baby safe

98
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,519
if you don't mind.

99
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,160
Young Master Zhaomu.

100
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:42,759
Follow her and take good care of her.

101
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,879
I can go to the military camp alone.

102
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,120
Yes.

103
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,680
Look what I brought you.

104
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,839
These are your favorite.

105
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:07,639
Try them.

106
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,839
Qingyun, I really have no appetite.

107
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,079
Don't bother.

108
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,839
Why are you doing this to yourself?

109
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,879
Eat some

110
00:07:15,959 --> 00:07:16,959
for the baby.

111
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,560
Sure.

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,920
Sit down and eat with me.

113
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,279
Watching you eat

114
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,879
might give me appetite.

115
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,639
Sure, I won't hold back then.

116
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,240
Qingyun, what happened?

117
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,920
Don't eat.

118
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,639
What's wrong?

119
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,000
The cakes are...

120
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,480
Qingyun.

121
00:07:57,319 --> 00:07:57,879
