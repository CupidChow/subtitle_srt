(and incidents in this drama

5
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:58,859
He's eliminating devils
in a devilish way.

6
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,829
What an unprecedented psycho.

7
00:01:00,929 --> 00:01:04,840
There was such a case 20 years ago.
The executor's murder case.

8
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,500
"Executioner"?

9
00:01:07,269 --> 00:01:09,739
Square one.
We were forgetting about square one.

10
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:13,480
We have a witness. A witness
who clearly saw the Executioner.

11
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,849
My memory?

12
00:01:16,349 --> 00:01:18,280
A mask. A silicon mask.

13
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,650
Special effects makeup?

14
00:01:20,319 --> 00:01:21,989
Why was it Cho Sung Dong?

15
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:23,920
He wasn't alone.

16
00:01:24,519 --> 00:01:27,159
The second man at the scene.
The cameraman.

17
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,659
We'll be carrying out
a search and seizure...

18
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,459
of your residence right now.

19
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:35,930
That jerk had been killing
the victims...

20
00:01:36,569 --> 00:01:37,769
as offerings.

21
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:40,310
Was that woman really my mom?

22
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,239
Answer me, you scumbag!

23
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:45,879
Here's the forensic report.

24
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:48,409
Those were animal bones.

25
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,049
A murder will take place...

26
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:53,379
tonight.

27
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,019
I found out Jin Jae Gyu's trick.

28
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,519
A motorcycle?

29
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:00,760
Jin Jae Gyu escaped through
the secret passageway.

30
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,760
Old Man, go meet Cho Sung Dong now.

31
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,300
(Previously on Memorist)

32
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:12,770
(Previously on Memorist)

33
00:02:12,969 --> 00:02:14,009
Freeze!

34
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,810
Don't even make a move,
or I'll bury a bullet in your head.

35
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,520
I can't remember
no matter how hard I try.

36
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:29,550
He can control people's memories
at will.

37
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,020
How did you give orders
to your accomplice?

38
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:34,289
Read my memory.

39
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:36,259
- Do you mean it?
- Of course.

40
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:40,060
Because the victims
have been chosen.

41
00:02:40,469 --> 00:02:42,930
The last one will die
before the end of the month...

42
00:02:44,169 --> 00:02:46,039
because you have touched them.

43
00:02:50,009 --> 00:02:51,439
What did you see in his memories?

44
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,310
- The secret passage.
- Don't you find it strange?

45
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:57,080
Why would such a meticulous guy
leave traces of the water pump?

46
00:02:57,180 --> 00:02:58,280
Just get to the point.

47
00:02:58,650 --> 00:02:59,650
The accomplice.

48
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,120
Was the secret passage made
in order to hide his accomplice?

49
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:03,889
Yoon Hee Tae.

50
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:06,719
Yoon Hee Tae owns dozens of
properties under borrowed names,

51
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:07,930
and they're all located
in secluded areas.

52
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:13,500
(Previously on Memorist)

53
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,930
I didn't know you'd make it here.

54
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:18,639
Getting rid of you two
and getting on a boat...

55
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:20,370
will take me only three minutes.

56
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,370
1 minute 30 seconds.

57
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,939
He has a knife!

58
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,310
You failed.

59
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:30,819
The kid and his mom are both safe.

60
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,050
What?

61
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,819
Something's not right.

62
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:35,490
No...

63
00:03:37,419 --> 00:03:38,460
No.

64
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:42,659
(29 years ago)

65
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,639
Good evening. Tonight, the Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics...

66
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:05,480
has officially seized to exist.

67
00:05:05,779 --> 00:05:08,180
Out of the 15 republics,

68
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,180
11 leaders aside from...

69
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,480
the 3 Baltic states and Georgia...

70
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:17,420
held a summit at Alma-Ata,
Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic.

71
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,519
- They have officially announced...
- Honey,

72
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,290
- say good night to Dad.
- the disbandment...

73
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,629
and have discussed Commonwealth
of Independent States...

74
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,639
Good night.

75
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:47,189
Can't you be nicer to her?

76
00:05:49,589 --> 00:05:50,589
Okay.

77
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:54,660
- I will.
- Do you have to make it obvious...

78
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:55,990
she's not your daughter?

79
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,040
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,949
I'm sensitive these days.

81
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:20,519
No, it's because I've gotten weak.

82
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:22,750
You'll get better soon.

83
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:25,589
I'll make sure of it...

84
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,689
no matter what.

85
00:06:33,829 --> 00:06:34,870
Thank you.

86
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,970
I'm thankful to you
and Sang Hwa too.

87
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,490
No. Don't touch me.

88
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:39,829
Did you catch anything?

89
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:41,629
Not yet.

90
00:07:43,269 --> 00:07:44,939
Is he really not the murderer?

91
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,910
Jin Jae Gyu isn't the Eraser.

92
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:49,509
"Eraser"?

93
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:53,540
The true criminal who killed
six people,

94
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,810
starting with Park Gi Dan.

95
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,379
The murderer with a superpower
that can erase memories.

96
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,089
Who is it?

97
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,019
It was erased.

98
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,019
- His memories of the murderer?
- All of it?

99
00:08:05,689 --> 00:08:07,660
Everything regarding his identity.

100
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,790
Then reading his memory won't help.

101
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:11,959
We'll have to find a lead.

102
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,069
What kind of a lead?

103
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,800
The Eraser picked Jin Jae Gyu
as his puppet for a reason.

104
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,540
I'm sure of it.

105
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,069
Didn't you say there was nothing
left in his memory?

106
00:08:21,069 --> 00:08:23,040
The Eraser was lurking around him.

107
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:24,639
"Around him"?

108
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:26,310
Are you positive?

109
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,320
- What will you do?
- I'll have to search...

110
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,120
for the true devil who was near him.

111
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,720
You may put your own life at risk.

112
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:45,759
He opened his eyes.

113
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,110
Sang...

114
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,389
Make sure to take your medication
and don't skip any meals.

115
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,230
I'm going to be late today.

116
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,070
Yes, I've prepared everything
as per your request.

117
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:03,139
I guess you're unsatisfied.

118
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:07,009
This isn't something
a lawyer would recommend.

119
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,909
Registering your marriage...

120
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,080
will help decrease
your inheritance tax.

121
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,519
I won't be able
to live for long anyway.

122
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,450
That's all the more reason...

123
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,190
It will only torment my wife
even more after I'm gone...

124
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,820
because of my family.

125
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,929
I understand.
I'll have them notarized then.

126
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:34,409
Here's your ring.

127
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,580
Your fiancee is a lucky woman.

128
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,509
There's only one of these in Korea.

129
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:45,879
I'd like that as well.

130
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,720
Oh, my. You have a keen eye.

131
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,860
But that and the ring aren't a set.

132
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,190
How about that necklace?

133
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:59,960
No, thank you.
The necklace is for my daughter.

134
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,740
Your daughter? What a lucky girl.

135
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,110
She's lucky to have
such a considerate stepdad.

136
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:33,399
He consumed rat poison.
We'll have to monitor him.

137
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:35,669
What if I bring him to a bigger vet?

138
00:11:35,669 --> 00:11:38,940
There's nothing else they can do
except give him an IV.

139
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:50,309
I'll take him.

140
00:11:51,149 --> 00:11:53,379
Sure. You can do as you wish.

141
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,360
She's very shocked.

142
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:10,899
- Are you not eating?
- What?

143
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,269
I had dinner with my colleagues.

144
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,710
Come to think of it,
we never ate together recently.

145
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,750
What?

146
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:25,620
I'm always the first one out
and the last one to come home.

147
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:28,990
It'd be nice...

148
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,220
if we could eat together.

149
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,039
You shouldn't suspect her.

150
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,539
She saved your life.

151
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,039
There's no way
she poisoned your food.

152
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:28,980
Sir?

153
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,090
Where are you headed
so early in the morning?

154
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:46,529
It's food waste.

155
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:48,870
You should've just called.

156
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,700
You're a lunatic.

157
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:26,139
How weak.

158
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,470
It's been a week.

159
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:29,940
She hates you.

160
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,409
No, she's devoted to me.

161
00:14:31,409 --> 00:14:32,610
It's all because of your money!

162
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,580
You inherited 30 million dollars
from your dad.

163
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,679
She's going to kill you for that.

164
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,779
That's not true.

165
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:13,879
Did you find out who the Eraser is?

166
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,889
- I need to check?
- Who is it?

167
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,960
They were hospitalized
at the same mental hospital.

168
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,460
A mental hospital.

169
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,389
Jin Jae Gyu spent most
of his childhood...

170
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,929
in solitary confinement
at the mental hospital.

171
00:15:26,029 --> 00:15:27,059
And?

172
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,269
And one day,
the patient next door...

173
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:30,970
self-mutilated himself
by cutting the back of his hand.

174
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:35,940
Even after he was discharged,
he was lurking around him...

175
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:38,210
with a claw hammer in his hand.

176
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:55,529
(Episode 9:
The Eyes Beneath One's Feet)

177
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,379
I heard the real culprit
is someone else.

178
00:16:17,509 --> 00:16:21,220
But in my point of view,
I can only see one murderer.

179
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,659
That's an aggressive way...

180
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,159
of saying hi.

181
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,559
But then again,

182
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:33,899
that's how you are.

183
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,769
Where's Det. Dong?

184
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,309
I believe he was scanning
my memory all night long.

185
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:47,240
Mr. Jin.

186
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,149
Tell me about the real culprit.

187
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:53,549
- Didn't Det. Dong tell you?
- I want you to tell me.

188
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:56,990
You don't believe
that my memory is real.

189
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,360
Det. Dong believes another devil
was lurking around you.

190
00:17:00,659 --> 00:17:01,990
But I beg to differ.

191
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,559
- How so?
- Fruit of the poisonous tree.

192
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,700
(A proverb saying that a fruit
from a poisonous tree...)

193
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,829
(is poisonous as well.)

194
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,630
Since I'm a liar, you think
my memory is a lie as well.

195
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,039
- Thanks.
- I feel wrongly accused.

196
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:16,140
Where should we begin?

197
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:19,740
You don't believe in my testimony?

198
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:24,450
Be my guest
and try to contradict it.

199
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,579
Shall we begin from the moment
you became a murderer?

200
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,319
You want me to be the sole devil.

201
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:31,650
(Dental Clinic)

202
00:18:34,019 --> 00:18:36,519
Mr. Kim Tae Jun,
please come to the shot room.

203
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:39,690
Let me stop by my house.

204
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,509
Stop it.

205
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:03,450
- Why not?
- It's ticklish.

206
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,519
Come here.

207
00:19:14,529 --> 00:19:16,460
- What's wrong?
- What do you mean?

208
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:18,230
Why isn't he dead already?

209
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,930
You said it wouldn't take that long.

210
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:21,529
They'll suspect you
if it's too sudden.

211
00:19:21,529 --> 00:19:24,069
Then when?
I'm getting impatient here.

212
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:26,000
Hey, you're not the only one
struggling.

213
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,609
I'm the one who's being tormented
by those loan sharks.

214
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:29,970
And it's all thanks
to your gambling debt.

215
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,509
You're the one
who dragged me into that.

216
00:19:32,509 --> 00:19:34,410
I don't want to hear it.
Just be patient.

217
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,849
He'll let Sang Hwa
inherit everything.

218
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:38,819
We'll have to wait
until she becomes an adult.

219
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:41,589
That's why I wanted to just threaten
his family and take a bit of it.

220
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,490
You're the one who wanted
to take all of his money.

221
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,920
Do you think I did it for myself?

222
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,289
Do you know how creepy it is
to see his face every day?

223
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,029
- Prepare some for Sang Hwa.
- Prepare what?

224
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,700
- Arsenic.
- Have you gone insane?

225
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:01,869
She has a weak heart anyway.
It's better.

226
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:04,240
- She's our daughter!
- You were never there for her.

227
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,480
You have no right to say that!

228
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,880
What did you just say?

229
00:20:32,769 --> 00:20:34,170
This is the vet.

230
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:38,579
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but your dog passed away.

231
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,849
It's in order to save lives.

232
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,079
The offerings are given
to save lives.

233
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:46,779
I will become a murderer.

234
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,750
I will remove all sins
from this world...

235
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,660
for the others.

236
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,410
You tried to protect Sang Hwa?

237
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,670
Are you disappointed?

238
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,140
Even though she wasn't your own?

239
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,150
Do you like sports?

240
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:26,150
Humans are fascinating.

241
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,390
They can empathize
with anyone and anything.

242
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,759
Many people consider
their pet dogs as family.

243
00:22:32,990 --> 00:22:35,190
Then there are baseball teams,
soccer teams,

244
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:37,960
impalpable concepts,

245
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:39,859
and patriotism.

246
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,130
Which one is your true self?

247
00:22:43,099 --> 00:22:44,599
How much of you is a murderer...

248
00:22:44,869 --> 00:22:46,400
and how much of you is a stepdad
who tried to save his...

249
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,500
My true self?

250
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:51,710
Everyone believes they all have
a true self within them.

251
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:53,380
But that doesn't exist.

252
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:57,109
You can only define an individual
by their actions.

253
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,750
I wonder what kinds of actions
you'll take...

254
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:07,019
when you meet
your father's murderer.

255
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,900
When Jin Jae Gyu was
at a mental hospital,

256
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,839
a seriously ill patient
was next door.

257
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:25,980
He had an unusual, four-line scar
on the back of his hand.

258
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:28,039
And someone with the same scar...

259
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,650
has been lurking around him
even after his discharge?

260
00:23:31,079 --> 00:23:32,579
It was the same scar.

261
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,250
And he had a claw hammer
in his hand.

262
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,549
He had a claw hammer?
Was that really the Eraser?

263
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,589
He kept mumbling something
at the hospital.

264
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:42,529
This is a rotten world.
Everyone one is despicable.

265
00:23:42,529 --> 00:23:44,089
I must take my revenge
on the last day of the month.

266
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,259
"I must take my revenge
on the last day of the month."

267
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:47,859
That's the Eraser.

268
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:51,170
And that man was hiding
at Jae Gyu's caretaker's house?

269
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,640
Oh Se Hoon speaking.

270
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:59,640
Yes. We're looking for a caretaker
who lived in the same town...

271
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,109
as Jin Jae Gyu 20 years ago.

272
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:04,950
Yes, we're aware
that an apartment complex was built.

273
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:08,619
No, no, no. He lived there
before the apartments were built.

274
00:24:08,619 --> 00:24:10,119
He lived in a farmhouse.

275
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,529
No one was registered to that house?

276
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,759
Are you positive?

277
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,230
Got it. Thank you.

278
00:24:23,269 --> 00:24:24,369
There's no record.

279
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,670
No. No one was registered
to the house...

280
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,509
the caretaker lived in.

281
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:30,670
- What should we do?
- What do you think?

282
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,940
Tracking him down
is a cakewalk for our Old Man.

283
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,279
You bet. It's a piece of cake.

284
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:38,420
Where should we go, Mr. Holmes?

285
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:40,549
Let's go
to Jin Jae Gyu's neighborhood.

286
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:43,990
- And then?
- Search for the sheriff.

287
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,390
- "Sheriff"?
- There's always...

288
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:49,130
one experienced sheriff
in such neighborhoods.

289
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,230
Okay.

290
00:24:51,289 --> 00:24:53,130
What do you mean? Fill me in.

291
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,529
(Hakbaek 1-ri Town Hall)

292
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:58,099
We called him Choi.

293
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:02,140
He worked as a caretaker
for that wealthy house.

294
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:03,640
What?

295
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:06,779
Here it is. "Choi Kyung Man".

296
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,750
Where does he live right now?

297
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:10,579
How would I know?

298
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:12,980
He left more than two decades ago.

299
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,519
What about his family?

300
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,950
He was a single dad.

301
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:19,390
I believe he had a child.

302
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:20,920
Was it a son?

303
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,789
Yes, it was.

304
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:28,430
Shall we talk about the Eraser?

305
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:32,470
Who came up with that nickname?

306
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,140
I'm not sure. I can't remember.

307
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:38,039
You said he was the killer,
but you know nothing about him?

308
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:39,940
You could say that.

309
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:43,009
- I thought you met many times?
- And he always erased my memory.

310
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,920
He erased everything about him.

311
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:48,519
His face, voice... Everything.

312
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,920
Do you think I'd buy that?

313
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,720
I beg to differ.

314
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,920
There's still a high chance...

315
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:57,190
that you're the Eraser.

316
00:25:58,259 --> 00:25:59,329
On what grounds?

317
00:25:59,329 --> 00:26:01,400
You even subdued
Det. Dong's superpower.

318
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,240
Cognitive dissonance.

319
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:16,849
Once a prejudice is formed,
it's hard to break free from it.

320
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,950
What about the hallucinations
he had?

321
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,650
Beats me.
Sadly, I don't have such powers.

322
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,160
We three were the only ones there.

323
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:29,490
Do you know why the Eraser
is so frightening?

324
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,829
It's because I have no idea
how he controls my consciousness...

325
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:35,670
or how he erases my memories.

326
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:40,269
He only leaves the memories
he wants me to remember.

327
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:43,269
He was able to control it
without touching?

328
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,509
Or maybe...

329
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:47,640
it's a completely different reason.

330
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:50,380
What do you mean?

331
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:04,230
Hello, sir.

332
00:27:09,369 --> 00:27:11,000
Who are you?

333
00:27:13,369 --> 00:27:14,440
Come in.

334
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,109
Tae Gu, you have guests.

335
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,069
Baek! Watch out!

336
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:48,069
Tae Gu, sit down!

337
00:28:04,319 --> 00:28:06,259
I was the Executioner.

338
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:14,299
- What?
- I killed many starting with...

339
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:15,599
Park Hee Bum in 1999.

340
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,609
Are you confessing?

341
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:30,509
However, I wasn't the one
behind the murders this year.

342
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:34,750
From Park Gi Dan to Cho Sung Dong.

343
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,619
Mr. Jin Jae Gyu.

344
00:28:39,990 --> 00:28:42,990
Did you also kill the union head of
Sungpan Automobiles 20 years ago?

345
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,470
Do you mean your father?

346
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,970
It's the only case...

347
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:56,039
the statute of limitations
hasn't expired yet.

348
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,140
Will you only admit to the cases
that are expired?

349
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,910
Do you want to know the truth?

350
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:04,380
Let's make a deal.

351
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:07,849
- What deal?
- I'll tell you the truth...

352
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:10,349
including what happened to your dad.

353
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:17,430
- What's your condition?
- Send Sang Hwa's family away...

354
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,759
abroad.

355
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,910
He turned like this
when he served in the army.

356
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:31,569
He was beaten by his senior.

357
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:40,349
By the way, what is that?

358
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,619
It's the army ranking symbol.

359
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,859
The one who beat my son
was a corporal.

360
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:51,900
It must have upset him a lot.
He probably made those marks...

361
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,529
on his body because he wants
to become a corporal too.

362
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:04,970
Did you get any compensation?

363
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:07,410
Unfortunately, I'm a know-nothing
who's illiterate.

364
00:30:09,079 --> 00:30:12,920
How did you end up
managing Jin Jae Gyu's house?

365
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:16,420
He took me in because
he felt sorry for my son.

366
00:30:16,819 --> 00:30:19,819
He even provided us a place to live
and paid for the treatments too.

367
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,160
Why didn't you continue
to live there?

368
00:30:23,329 --> 00:30:25,829
Mr. Jin suddenly disappeared.

369
00:30:26,829 --> 00:30:28,500
He probably had a change of heart.

370
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,829
No, it wasn't that.

371
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:35,039
He hurt his head
and lost his memories.

372
00:30:35,609 --> 00:30:36,740
Gosh.

373
00:30:37,769 --> 00:30:40,180
No wonder. It wasn't like him
to suddenly disappear.

374
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:43,410
I was upset at him for nothing.

375
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,890
Is your son always like that?

376
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:53,460
His condition just doesn't seem
to get any better.

377
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,559
Det. Dong,

378
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,799
could you touch my son's head?

379
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:06,170
- Pardon?
- Maybe he'll get better...

380
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:08,369
if you touch him
with your superpower hand.

381
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,809
He can read memories,
but he can't heal...

382
00:31:11,809 --> 00:31:14,710
It's okay. Sure, I'll try.

383
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,579
Let's try.

384
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,279
Gosh, thank you.

385
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:22,519
Thank you. Thank you so much.

386
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,049
Thank you, Det. Dong.

387
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,119
Thank you so much.

388
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,960
May I?

389
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:33,329
Okay.

390
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,859
Is that how a murderer
shows consideration?

391
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:07,059
What if Det. Dong is the Eraser?

392
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,299
That's impossible.

393
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,339
He was with me
when Cho Sung Dong died.

394
00:32:15,339 --> 00:32:17,109
Are you sure you can rely
on your memories?

395
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:18,569
Of course.

396
00:32:18,569 --> 00:32:20,440
Even in this moment, I think...

397
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,910
that maybe you're the Eraser.

398
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,119
Perhaps you told me your identity
a minute ago...

399
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,720
to only erase my memories again.

400
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:33,259
Everyone, step outside.

401
00:32:35,289 --> 00:32:36,490
That's an illness.

402
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:38,190
That's how scary the Eraser is.

403
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:42,329
It wouldn't be a surprise
for anyone to be the Eraser.

404
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:44,170
Do you know?

405
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:47,369
There are two possible roots
for a person's aggression.

406
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,039
You too.

407
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,809
Don't tell Han Sun Mi I'm here...

408
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,509
and make sure everyone
keeps it a secret.

409
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:58,279
Yes, sir.

410
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,789
Pleasure and fear.

411
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,660
Serial murderers kill
for the pleasure,

412
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:12,559
but most people are aggressive
against those they fear.

413
00:33:13,529 --> 00:33:16,470
Are you saying I killed people
because I'm a coward?

414
00:33:18,069 --> 00:33:19,339
How interesting.

415
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,470
But, remember this.

416
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:25,779
If you want to face the Eraser,

417
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,880
you should doubt
your memories first.

418
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,329
(20 years ago)

419
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,400
Who are you?

420
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:25,969
Who are you?

421
00:34:30,309 --> 00:34:31,409
Where am I?

422
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:52,800
Who are you?

423
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:13,719
They killed each other...

424
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,719
in fury?

425
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,750
It wasn't fury.

426
00:35:20,289 --> 00:35:22,630
- It was fear.
- "Fear"?

427
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,730
Everyone prepared for it
while suffering extreme fear.

428
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:33,599
Why?

429
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:36,139
Their memories were erased...

430
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:39,409
and all they could remember
was fear.

431
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,710
Are you saying
it was the Eraser's doing?

432
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:43,510
Of course.

433
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:46,420
- Was it the one with the sack?
- No.

434
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:50,090
The Eraser was somewhere else.

435
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:53,719
- Where?
- Somewhere nearby.

436
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,829
- It's not him, is it?
- He's clean.

437
00:36:33,059 --> 00:36:35,329
If it's not him, what do we do?

438
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:36,769
You said he'd be hiding
in someone's memories.

439
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,099
We need to start Plan B.

440
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,440
- "Plan B"?
- I'll find out when the Eraser...

441
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:44,269
first appeared and Jin Jae Gyu's
memories started to disappear.

442
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:46,309
- Do you mean...
- Yes.

443
00:36:46,409 --> 00:36:48,309
The mass riot case
from 20 years ago.

444
00:36:48,579 --> 00:36:50,780
I heard there are no records
of the case from that time.

445
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:53,519
It's strange it was ignored because
people were hurt so seriously.

446
00:36:53,519 --> 00:36:54,679
Are there none?

447
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,820
None. They looked everywhere,
but nothing was found.

448
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,989
No mention of deaths,
and not even a case of assault.

449
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:02,460
Did they just put on some
relief patches and part ways?

450
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,860
No. They suffered
serious injuries at least.

451
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:06,500
They were definitely trying
to kill each other.

452
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:08,829
Hey, how is that possible
when there are no records?

453
00:37:09,469 --> 00:37:10,800
But they saw the Eraser.

454
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,340
They did, but no one remembers him.

455
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:15,440
Not his face nor his voice.

456
00:37:17,139 --> 00:37:18,409
What's certain is...

457
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:21,210
that it was the day
the Eraser first appeared...

458
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,949
while revealing his superpower.

459
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,449
That means we have to find
the record of the mass riot...

460
00:37:27,449 --> 00:37:28,949
in order to find any clues.

461
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:30,489
Okay, Plan B it is.

462
00:37:34,389 --> 00:37:35,420
Yes?

463
00:37:35,659 --> 00:37:36,889
There is no record of the case.

464
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:39,000
- I know that.
- We can't trust...

465
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,099
all of Jin Jae Gyu's memories.

466
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,429
Why is that?

467
00:37:41,429 --> 00:37:44,329
What if he's the Eraser?

468
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:47,900
What if he tricked you again
with a fake illusion?

469
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:54,010
You don't have to tell me.
I already have all of that in mind.

470
00:37:55,079 --> 00:37:57,550
I thought maybe you forgot
about losing last time.

471
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,380
I would never forget a fight I lost.

472
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,849
I'm glad.

473
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,090
Did you know?

474
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:06,590
Sometimes I hate you more
than Jin Jae Gyu.

475
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,389
I'm glad about that too.

476
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,190
At least it's not all the time.

477
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:13,000
You must be taking classes
on how to talk nicely.

478
00:38:13,329 --> 00:38:14,429
Let me remind you one more time.

479
00:38:14,429 --> 00:38:16,769
Don't fall
for Jin Jae Gyu's memories.

480
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:21,000
If the Eraser doesn't exist,
what you say must be right.

481
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,010
That would mean Jin Jae Gyu
is the Eraser.

482
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,940
Come to a conclusion
as soon as possible.

483
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,150
We're on the same page. Bye.

484
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,420
We'll extend the period
to before 2000.

485
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,619
What if we still can't find
any records?

486
00:38:37,989 --> 00:38:39,190
We'll continue to extend...

487
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:40,820
until we find something.

488
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,960
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

489
00:38:42,559 --> 00:38:44,989
Ma'am, earlier...

490
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,530
The deputy chief's visit
must remain a secret.

491
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,300
Especially
to Senior Superintendent Han.

492
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,900
It's nothing, ma'am. Okay.

493
00:39:13,389 --> 00:39:17,090
What if a mass riot never happened?

494
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:18,929
That means
Jin Jae Gyu is the Eraser.

495
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,960
No, it was erased.

496
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:23,000
- "Erased"?
- Their memories?

497
00:39:23,369 --> 00:39:24,369
No, the record.

498
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,070
Was the record covered up?

499
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,170
I'm certain this case happened.

500
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:31,969
Can they do that
in the 21st century?

501
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:35,949
Where are we going?

502
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,150
To find the remaining record.

503
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,420
"The remaining record"?

504
00:39:46,090 --> 00:39:46,700
I had a nightmare.
(20 years ago)

505
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:47,519
I had a nightmare.

506
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,130
An awful nightmare.

507
00:40:32,969 --> 00:40:34,599
But, it wasn't a dream.

508
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:38,570
And?

509
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:40,880
What would you have done...

510
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,980
if you were the murderer
facing such a situation?

511
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,780
I'd want to kill the culprit.

512
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:16,449
It didn't align with the principles
of the Executioner,

513
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,719
but it was no time
to think about that.

514
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,119
Were you scared?

515
00:41:22,949 --> 00:41:24,019
More than that,

516
00:41:26,489 --> 00:41:27,989
I desired to win.

517
00:42:24,849 --> 00:42:26,079
What did the numbers mean?

518
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:27,849
They were the dates...

519
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,489
I executed the devils.

520
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,670
(Do not disobey.)

521
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,769
I realized...

522
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,730
it wasn't the first time.

523
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,599
- What wasn't?
- That I tried to kill him.

524
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:51,940
It had repeated multiple times.

525
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,539
I would lose to him every time,

526
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:56,750
and he erased my memories
over and over again...

527
00:42:57,409 --> 00:43:01,119
like deleting security footage.

528
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,289
He cleared my memories.

529
00:43:03,719 --> 00:43:06,489
How are you so sure
when you don't have any memories?

530
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:07,889
That time...

531
00:43:14,099 --> 00:43:15,659
My memories were erased,

532
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,469
but the feelings
didn't seize to exist.

533
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,440
"Feelings"?

534
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,369
Fear.

535
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:26,840
Can a psychopath feel fear?

536
00:43:31,050 --> 00:43:33,880
I won't agree or disagree
with your comment,

537
00:43:35,019 --> 00:43:36,590
but I know what fear feels like.

538
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,860
Were you scared to die?

539
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,989
No.

540
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:43,460
I was scared to lose.

541
00:43:44,429 --> 00:43:45,530
"Lose"?

542
00:43:46,699 --> 00:43:48,559
What was a murderer
scared of losing?

543
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,400
Sang Hwa.

544
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,769
He could see right through me.

545
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,340
I was scared he would hurt Sang Hwa.

546
00:44:00,309 --> 00:44:02,710
Is that why you were abroad
for 20 years?

547
00:44:05,050 --> 00:44:07,980
Anyway, he never appeared
in front of me again.

548
00:44:22,659 --> 00:44:24,230
Not until three months ago.

549
00:44:29,070 --> 00:44:31,809
(Come back.)

550
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:37,579
(Come back.)

551
00:44:51,090 --> 00:44:52,860
It was recorded
per the Eraser's order,

552
00:44:53,059 --> 00:44:55,429
but he couldn't tell Yoon Hee Tae
the plan.

553
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:59,539
He didn't know when or how
he'd lose his memories.

554
00:45:18,219 --> 00:45:19,489
He didn't have much time.

555
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,059
He made a call right after
his contact with the Eraser.

556
00:45:28,659 --> 00:45:29,699
Yes?

557
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,199
To tell Yoon Hee Tae to run away
with his family.

558
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:38,409
Dad!

559
00:45:44,349 --> 00:45:46,010
Jin Jae Gyu always told him...

560
00:45:46,719 --> 00:45:48,820
to protect his family
from the Eraser.

561
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,489
If I ever die,

562
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:52,489
follow this manual.

563
00:45:54,789 --> 00:45:55,789
Hurry.

564
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,699
But Yoon Hee Tae
went against the plan...

565
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:03,170
at the last moment.

566
00:46:04,599 --> 00:46:06,400
He decided to kill...

567
00:46:07,539 --> 00:46:09,039
the murderer with the superpower.

568
00:46:10,139 --> 00:46:11,340
Why?

569
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:14,110
Why did he risk his life
for a psychopathic murderer?

570
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:17,880
Jin Jae Gyu is a murderer,
but he's not a psychopath.

571
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:19,179
What?

572
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:20,420
What is he then?

573
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:25,090
Are you keeping it
to yourself again?

574
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:28,420
What else did you see
in Jin Jae Gyu's memories?

575
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:30,730
The pain he suffered
during his childhood.

576
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,860
- "His childhood"?
- What pain?

577
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:40,639
You need to stop acting like
you're a protagonist of a drama.

578
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:44,440
If you're going to keep this up,
just stop talking to me.

579
00:46:45,309 --> 00:46:46,480
I won't bother with you anymore.

580
00:46:46,679 --> 00:46:48,340
Stop! You're not any better.

581
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:55,179
What are we doing here this time?

582
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:56,920
To find records.

583
00:46:57,320 --> 00:46:59,119
Gosh, he finally answered.

584
00:46:59,559 --> 00:47:00,659
Goodness.

585
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:02,159
Records?

586
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:05,630
If it was concluded as an accident
rather than assault,

587
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:06,960
there won't be any police records.

588
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:08,530
Then what about
the emergency center?

589
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:09,829
They may have it.

590
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:13,469
I didn't know you'd come here too.

591
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:15,369
- "Too?"
- Did someone else come?

592
00:47:16,039 --> 00:47:18,510
- Weren't you on the same team?
- Same team?

593
00:47:24,380 --> 00:47:26,079
What do you want this time?

594
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:28,150
Look who's talking.

595
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,949
Did Senior Superintendent Han
send you?

596
00:47:29,949 --> 00:47:31,750
- Don't talk down to us.
- Of course.

597
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:33,360
She never fails to amaze me.

598
00:47:33,519 --> 00:47:35,789
- Are you here for accident records?
- Did you find anything?

599
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,829
We're looking for accidents
that resulted in casualties.

600
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:42,230
But they don't have any information
on the database,

601
00:47:42,429 --> 00:47:43,429
so we're doing it by hand.

602
00:47:43,429 --> 00:47:45,570
- Then let's split the work.
- There's no need.

603
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:47,739
What's with you? That'll be helpful.

604
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,469
- I already found it.
- What?

605
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:51,510
This is what you call a genius.

606
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,820
"Simbae City Suffocation Accident"?

607
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,489
"Death due to
carbon monoxide poisoning?"

608
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:05,019
They were all 20 years old?

609
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:08,820
Baek.

610
00:48:09,460 --> 00:48:10,630
I saw it.

611
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,230
What? See what?

612
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:14,400
A survivor.

613
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,369
- Survivor?
- "One person with a light injury"?

614
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:18,730
The name is...

615
00:48:18,730 --> 00:48:19,800
(Shim Sang Ah, female,
17 years old)

616
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:21,440
She was 17 back then?

617
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:23,639
Then was it...

618
00:48:55,639 --> 00:48:58,110
What? What are you talking about?

619
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:00,840
You were at the Simbae City
accident site 20 years ago.

620
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:03,150
The moment the murderer
first appeared.

621
00:49:03,849 --> 00:49:05,650
I did live in Simbae City, but...

622
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:07,949
I don't remember...

623
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:10,550
May I read your memory?

624
00:49:11,519 --> 00:49:12,650
Me?

625
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:18,760
Will it help find my husband?

626
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:20,860
Maybe.

627
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:51,389
There's nothing in her memory

628
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:52,690
Again?

629
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:54,559
I can't take this anymore.

630
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:56,000
He practically erases everything.

631
00:49:56,429 --> 00:49:58,170
What should we without superpowers
do? Just die?

632
00:49:58,170 --> 00:50:00,170
Whatever, let's just die then.

633
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:01,369
It wasn't erased.

634
00:50:12,179 --> 00:50:15,250
She was unconscious when
she was moved to the accident site.

635
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,849
That's right.

636
00:50:17,289 --> 00:50:20,789
I was admitted to the hospital once
because of gas poisoning.

637
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:22,920
Is there anything else you remember?

638
00:50:24,030 --> 00:50:26,800
I didn't know people died.

639
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:28,900
I suffered from
some severe aftereffects.

640
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:32,269
How could you not remember that?

641
00:50:33,800 --> 00:50:36,139
The two of you should find out
who died.

642
00:50:36,239 --> 00:50:38,639
- What? What about you?
- Hurry.

643
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,880
All you do is order me around.

644
00:50:42,579 --> 00:50:44,849
What could I possibly do
without any superpower?

645
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:47,119
Gosh, that pushover.

646
00:50:54,489 --> 00:50:56,530
Can you excuse us for a second?

647
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:00,260
We need to talk.

648
00:51:10,469 --> 00:51:11,670
Do you have any have suspicions?

649
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:13,480
I know you're the suspicious type,

650
00:51:13,480 --> 00:51:15,639
but I checked all her recent alibis.

651
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:17,650
- 100 percent?
- Seriously.

652
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:21,380
You're free to doubt
my scanning abilities, but...

653
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:26,619
What?

654
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,070
Don't these look a bit familiar?

655
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:47,510
Jin Jae Gyu's house.

656
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,150
A black face...

657
00:51:51,610 --> 00:51:52,809
and red eyes.

658
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,059
The Eraser.

659
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:05,159
- Where is this?
- Mr. Jin's house.

660
00:52:08,059 --> 00:52:10,269
- And what is this?
- A monster.

661
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:11,730
"Monster"?

662
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,139
What monster?

663
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:19,039
You saw a monster?

664
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:27,349
May we read your son's memory?

665
00:52:28,179 --> 00:52:29,280
My son's memory?

666
00:52:29,949 --> 00:52:31,590
I think Hyun Soo saw something.

667
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:33,110
The Eraser.

668
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:36,550
He was right below us.

669
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:41,820
The underground monster.

670
00:53:42,159 --> 00:53:45,389
- What monster?
- The underground monster.

671
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:47,360
The sewer.

672
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:50,199
Sewer...

673
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:54,940
The sewer.

674
00:53:59,909 --> 00:54:01,579
Send armed backup
to Jin Jae Gyu's house.

675
00:54:01,809 --> 00:54:04,110
He was actually there.
Right near us.

676
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:07,349
He grabbed your shoe?

677
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,420
He needs to make
physical contact too.

678
00:54:09,849 --> 00:54:11,190
In order to take over one's memory.

679
00:54:34,309 --> 00:54:35,440
Move aside.

680
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:38,449
Come on.

681
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,550
You're unarmed, so just back me up.

682
00:54:41,449 --> 00:54:42,750
You're so stubborn.

683
00:54:54,659 --> 00:54:55,800
I'll lead from here.

684
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:31,469
The makeup room.
The one below the greenhouse.

685
00:56:24,489 --> 00:56:25,650
Police. Don't move!

686
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:33,599
These aren't blanks.
Raise your hands!

687
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:29,579
Here you go, eat.

688
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:37,559
(Epilogue)

689
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:43,400
Oh, sir.

690
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,030
Here you go.

691
00:57:45,699 --> 00:57:46,730
What?

692
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:49,769
We must always give this to
those who offer their memories.

693
00:57:49,769 --> 00:57:51,110
It's a strict rule.

694
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:52,510
What is this...

695
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:54,710
What on earth?

696
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:57,780
This isn't from me. It's from the...

697
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,750
International Research Foundation.
That's the name of the place.

698
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:02,420
Please use it
for your son's treatment.

699
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:04,849
I'll find out if there are
any other ways we can support him.

700
00:58:04,849 --> 00:58:07,260
But... No, it's okay.

701
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:09,219
No, please. Goodbye, then.

702
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:10,690
But...

703
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:14,429
Thank you very much, sir.

704
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:15,699
Thank you.

705
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:26,210
Thank you, sir!

706
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:40,860
My gosh.

707
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:46,900
He left a message.

708
00:58:47,159 --> 00:58:49,329
"Someone will die
before the moon sets."

709
00:58:49,329 --> 00:58:52,199
"A sacrifice that will
cause you the most pain."

710
00:58:52,199 --> 00:58:54,099
Did you come to a conclusion?
About the next murder target?

711
00:58:54,340 --> 00:58:57,969
I'll use you as bait to set a trap.
It will be very dangerous.

712
00:58:58,369 --> 00:59:00,280
Not anyone can become partners
with a man with a superpower.

713
00:59:00,539 --> 00:59:03,110
Let's do it.
It's time for a real war.

714
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:06,710
The smell.
This place still reeks of it.

715
00:59:07,050 --> 00:59:08,349
The smell of death.

716
00:59:08,349 --> 00:59:11,219
I will kill you.

717
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:12,489
Senior Superintendent Han
is in danger.
