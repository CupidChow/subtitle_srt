4
00:00:38,009 --> 00:00:39,679
Who'll be able to handle him?

5
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:40,909
He'll read their memory...

6
00:00:40,909 --> 00:00:43,920
if they touch.

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,549
Detective, my daughter disappeared.

8
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:49,950
I can feel it when I read memories. The mother's thoughts...

9
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,619
I don't think this is a simple missing case.

10
00:00:51,619 --> 00:00:52,689
Proof of the serial killing?

11
00:00:52,689 --> 00:00:54,490
Their skulls were both crushed.

12
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:57,200
I believe they were attacked with a 4cm diameter object...

13
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,259
several times.

14
00:00:58,259 --> 00:00:59,859
So he's one of a kind.

15
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,130
Set up a Regional Investigation Unit...

16
00:01:01,130 --> 00:01:02,170
in Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

17
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:04,269
They found the third victim this morning.

18
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:06,840
- She was still breathing. - She's still alive.

19
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:09,340
- Did you see anything? - First, a red pig.

20
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,939
And the other thing was a small hammer...

21
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:12,739
that you can hold in one hand, like a claw hammer.

22
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,680
We don't even know if this is related to Claw Hammer.

23
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,609
Are you sure about the red pig?

24
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,780
I hope I'm wrong about this nasty hunch.

25
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,790
You'll die if you don't pass the test.

26
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,819
The girl before you died on a Tuesday as well.

27
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,159
It's a different phone model.

28
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,530
Find the number of the second phone.

29
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:31,129
I found her phone signal.

30
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,260
They're high school students.

31
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:34,629
They said they picked up the cellphone on the street.

32
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:36,469
We can ask them to find her. Bo Hyeon...

33
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:38,700
You were looking for Bo Hyeon.

34
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,840
(Previous story)

35
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,170
No, no!

36
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,140
We lost her there. At the three-way intersection.

37
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:49,150
As of this moment, dispatch all your men to search Onha-ri.

38
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,549
The RIU has dispatched all their men to search this area.

39
00:01:51,549 --> 00:01:53,420
They lost her at the three-way intersection,

40
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,290
and the RIU will start searching near the villas in Onha-ri.

41
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:57,189
Sir, you can go first.

42
00:01:57,489 --> 00:01:58,719
I have somewhere to drop by.

43
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,290
The side where the tail light goes out of view quickly.

(Onsang-ri, 3.6km, Onha-ri, 3.2km)

46
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,680
How did you get up there?

47
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,280
Quiet. I'll get out of here and call the police.

48
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,490
Please, take me with you!

49
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,889
Please, take me with you.

50
00:02:30,789 --> 00:02:32,259
There's just one location left...

51
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,930
1.5km away.

52
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,090
We lost her there. At the three-way intersection.

53
00:03:35,689 --> 00:03:39,090
Please...

54
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,530
Please save my daughter...

- Hurry up. - I got it.

57
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:43,720
I'm doing it.

58
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,420
- Why are you kicking the tire? - Should I kick you?

59
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,459
Should I kick you instead?

60
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:48,829
No, I didn't say that.

61
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,740
I found the red pig.

62
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,579
- Get him! - We got you!

63
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:08,649
- Come here! - That's enough!

64
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,579
- Move aside! - Wait!

65
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,779
- We have no time for... - Gosh.

66
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:14,449
Taser him.

67
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,790
- Put him in the car! - Let's go.

68
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:23,730
Why is someone with a superpower so weak?

69
00:06:01,699 --> 00:06:03,069
(Warning: This is private property.)

70
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:04,339
(Do not trespass or farm on this territory.)

71
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,170
From the corner until the gate,

72
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,779
there are cameras monitoring anyone who comes this way.

73
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:16,810
They can check all the visitors.

74
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,689
High fences and doors.

75
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,689
Why is there no one?

76
00:07:01,089 --> 00:07:03,129
It's a large cattle shed and afternoon, at that.

77
00:07:03,129 --> 00:07:04,560
Where are the farmers?

78
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,269
Is this a disguise?

79
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,379
Have they disguised this place...

80
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,980
for a different purpose?

81
00:10:50,789 --> 00:10:51,990
This won't do.

82
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,419
All right. Come out.

83
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,929
Don't move.

(32 minutes ago)

88
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,679
Darn it. Seriously.

89
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,679
He tattled.

90
00:12:58,879 --> 00:13:00,820
- What? - Shut it.

91
00:13:00,889 --> 00:13:03,049
He's the reason you're undergoing internal investigation.

92
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,360
What is he talking about?

93
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:09,159
- Hey. - He told them you were on the take.

94
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:11,559
- What? - No... No, that's not true.

95
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,000
The owner of the brothel bribed you to stop the investigation.

96
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:16,299
How could you betray him for merely 30,000 dollars?

97
00:13:16,299 --> 00:13:18,269
- Shut his mouth. - It's not true.

98
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,370
I saw a secret of yours as well.

99
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,840
It must be a trend these days...

100
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:23,240
to betray those around you.

101
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,340
Shut his mouth.

102
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,110
- You're dead meat. - It's not true!

103
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,149
Do you know how flirty he is?

104
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:33,120
- Shut his mouth! - Still, that's not right.

105
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,490
Lim Na Young is his girlfriend, you know?

107
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:46,129
Didn't Na Young recently get a luxury bag?

108
00:13:46,129 --> 00:13:47,799
This punk gave it to her after sleeping together.

109
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,429
- You scumbag... - Is that true?

110

111

Don't kill him.

We need him alive so that I can read his memory.

We'll need to perform an autopsy first.

149
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,309
She must have waited...

150
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,150
so long for me.

151
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,519
I can't make her wait any longer.

152
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:30,650
Ma'am.

153
00:22:31,789 --> 00:22:33,390
I think it's best you don't see her for now.

154
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:36,390
I should let her know that I'm here.

My poor baby.

156

I'll be honest with you.

00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,000
Place her on my back.

169
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:24,069
- Ma'am. - My poor baby!

170
00:23:35,619 --> 00:23:37,690
Han Man Pyung, who committed suicide,

171
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:38,890
was a key suspect in his 30s.

172
00:23:39,019 --> 00:23:42,390
He abducted, confined, and murdered his victims...

173
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:44,190
in an underground tunnel below his farm.

174
00:23:44,829 --> 00:23:47,500
This tunnel is presumed to have been made...

175
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:49,599
during the Japanese colonization for military purposes.

176
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,940
After his parents passed away,

177
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,369
- Okay. - he used this tunnel...

178
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:56,269
as his hideout.

179
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,769
- I understand. - There's a possibility...

180
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,079
he might have committed more crimes.

181
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,109
(Deputy Chief Lee Shin Woong)

182
00:24:01,849 --> 00:24:05,180
Up to now, we have confirmed at least four murder victims.

183
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:07,349
The only young female survivor...

184
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:09,450
has been transferred to a hospital to receive treatment.

185
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:11,519
Luckily, her injuries are minor,

186
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:14,220
so her life will not be threatened.

187
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,789
Meanwhile, the police and the NFS...

188
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:18,900
have formed a joint team...

189
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:20,900
to investigate possible additional crimes...

190
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:24,430
they haven't unveiled yet.

191
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:28,309
The police say they're investigating possible accomplices...

192
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,410
as a principle practice, not because of a lead.

193
00:24:31,539 --> 00:24:33,740
But since this case has such a big impact,

194
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,950
many are focusing on what the outcome might be.

195
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,650
Sir. You're here.

196
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,289
Why are you all here?

197
00:24:44,619 --> 00:24:46,420
- We're waiting for them to... - Exactly. Why?

198
00:24:46,759 --> 00:24:47,920
Well...

199
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:52,230
- A thorough investigation is key... - What about the survivor?

200
00:24:52,329 --> 00:24:55,170
Yes, the survivor. The young woman is in shock.

201
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:58,240
She just said that she never saw an accomplice...

202
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:00,400
We were waiting for you.

203
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,539
We need to ask you for a favor.

204
00:25:03,309 --> 00:25:05,109
- "A favor"? - An accomplice...

205
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,079
No. I'm sure there's someone else. Perhaps even the main culprit.

206
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:11,509
"The main culprit"?

207
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,579
Are you saying your initial profiling is still valid?

208
00:25:14,849 --> 00:25:16,220
Do you think the criminal is from the upper class?

209
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,190
Han Man Pyung isn't someone who would boast about murders.

210
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,019
I'm certain there's the main culprit.

211
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,630
Let me give you a word of advice. A prediction is only a prediction.

212
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:26,160
- You must be modest with a result. - That's why I'm asking for a favor.

213
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,859
As modestly as possible.

214
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:32,000
Please investigate thoroughly for any traces of accomplices.

215
00:25:32,869 --> 00:25:34,099
This is my last request.

216
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,049
I can't grant it.

217
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,779
You'll have to do it yourself.

218
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:50,390
But I was released from my position...

219
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:54,019
Your new title is Deputy Director of Special Investigation Team.

220
00:25:58,259 --> 00:25:59,859
Turn Han Sun Mi into a star.

221
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:02,569
Make everyone think she caught the criminal.

222
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:05,000
Tell everyone she was ahead of Dong Baek.

223
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,700
You can do the investigation briefing as well.

224
00:26:07,869 --> 00:26:10,369
That's the role of someone who caught the criminal.

225
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:24,019
- Hey. - Yes.

226
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:25,460
Let's go.

227
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:32,630
Sir, aren't you going to question him?

228
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,200
He'll be transferred to the Western District Prosecutor's Office...

229
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,369
in the morning.

230
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:37,630
But it was so hard to catch him.

231
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,599
Choose one.

232
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:42,769
Be wittier...

233
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:44,940
or watch your mouth.

234
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,190
I'm glad the criminal was caught just in time.

235
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,000
We were very lucky.

236
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:07,160
It won't get noisy, will it?

237
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:09,230
A serial murderer committed suicide.

238
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:11,170
Who would pay attention to a sex scandal?

239
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,170
I'll take care of it with my life.

240
00:27:15,539 --> 00:27:18,269
Not a single splatter of mud will get on your shoes.

241
00:27:18,779 --> 00:27:20,339
It won't end so quietly.

242
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,380
Pardon?

243
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:25,119
- But we caught the criminal. - Four women were killed.

244
00:27:26,119 --> 00:27:29,690
Usually, the anger would be directed to the murderer.

245
00:27:30,519 --> 00:27:31,619
But it's different this time.

246
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:35,789
There's no subject to direct their hatred.

247
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:39,559
The press will look for prey...

248
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,660
with their eyes wide open.

249
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,700
Remember that.

250
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,869
Make sure we don't become the scapegoat.

251
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:49,609
I'll work on the journalists.

252
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:51,369
There's a pad up there, right?

253
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,910
- Try that one too. - It takes 12 hours for the results.

254
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,910
Our goal of the investigation is to check for an accomplice.

255
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:59,579
Investigate anyone he met thoroughly...

256
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,880
so that we can figure out the personal details...

257
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,190
when the test results come out.

258
00:28:08,630 --> 00:28:11,559
- Do you know him? - No, I don't.

259
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:14,829
(National Forensic Service)

260
00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:18,029
(Test Result)

261
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,970
The test result is here.

262
00:28:35,849 --> 00:28:37,690
As for the suspicion about accomplices,

263
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,099
we couldn't find any evidence.

264
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,799
Aside from Han Man Pyung, we couldn't find any other DNA.

265
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,109
We heard Det. Dong Baek was on site. Why was he there?

266
00:28:58,109 --> 00:28:59,880
He was also pursuing the criminal.

267
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,240
Were you working together?

268
00:29:02,049 --> 00:29:03,109
No.

269
00:29:03,109 --> 00:29:05,079
Then who got there first?

270
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,049
That's a different issue, so I won't answer...

271
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:10,289
Senior Superintendent Han did.

272
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,289
She also infiltrated and arrested the criminal first.

273
00:29:13,859 --> 00:29:16,529
Then could you explain about the situation...

274
00:29:16,529 --> 00:29:17,730
at the time of Det. Dong's arrest?

275
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,930
This is irrelevant to the case.

276
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,630
Please direct your question to the prosecution.

277
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:24,130
She's so good.

278
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,400
You're known as a genius profiler.

279
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,609
How did you secure the key evidence?

280
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,710
That's it.

281
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,380
I did not solve this case alone.

282
00:29:33,609 --> 00:29:36,910
Before that, I want to sincerely send our condolences...

283
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,579
to the victims and the families of the victims.

284
00:29:40,019 --> 00:29:41,750
What is wrong with you? Just get started.

285
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:45,259
Yoon Ye Rim's missing location and the farm is only 1km away.

286
00:29:45,589 --> 00:29:47,990
Why didn't you search the farm earlier?

287
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,559
Strike.

288
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:55,200
- We searched properly. - Did you?

289
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,539
You were poking around in the wrong places.

290
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:02,410
Unfortunately, Yoon Ye Rim is a case of impulsive manslaughter.

291
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:04,210
The fact is that it was difficult to trace...

292
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:05,210
the murderer's line of movement.

293
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,910
Isn't that what we call a failed investigation?

294
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,250
(Police Investigation Report on Claw Hammer Serial Murder Case)

295
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,410
Don't admit to it.

296
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:13,380
As I mentioned earlier,

297
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,450
I want to sincerely send our condolences...

298
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,549
to the victims and the families...

299
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:19,119
- of the victims. - Goodness.

300
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,119
She's such a weakling.

301
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,890
We arrested the criminal by doing our best.

302
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:27,059
I want to remind you that we saved a survivor.

303
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,170
I heard that Det. Dong reported the location.

304
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,769
Why didn't you work together?

305
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:38,069
At the time, Det. Dong was under suspension.

306
00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,140
- But... - That doesn't matter.

307
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,180
You should've cooperated even if he was in jail.

308
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,150
We'll take one question at a time.

309
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,619
Your failed investigation led to more victims.

310
00:30:45,619 --> 00:30:47,079
How will you take responsibility?

311
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,920
Do you intend on announcing a public apology?

312
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,819
What do the police propose as a future prevention measure?

313
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:53,559
One at a time, please.

314
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,730
- Why didn't you cooperate? - Who will take responsibility?

315
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,960
What are your future plans?

316
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,529
Are you denying that the investigation was a failure?

317
00:31:00,529 --> 00:31:02,730
Do you know what the demands of the deceased families are?

318

Yes, Senior Superintendent Han.

What about the interview with the survivor?

337
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:06,799
We're being held back.

338
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,130
The doctor is one thing, but her guardian won't let me in.

339
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:10,930
- The guardian? - What are you saying?

340
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,299
- Because of the hospital bills. - What do you know?

341
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:13,940
- Push through as fast as you can. - Who are you?

342
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,910
- I'll try. - I told you!

343
00:32:18,039 --> 00:32:19,940
We don't have much time until the team disbands.

344
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:21,740
You have to meet her today.

345
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,950
- Okay, I understand. - You're the one who admitted her.

346
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:27,250
Right?

347
00:32:27,579 --> 00:32:29,920
Why are you saying this now after admitting her?

348
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:32,119
Don't hold me back.

349
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,119
Ma'am, there are patients here. Please keep it down.

350
00:32:35,329 --> 00:32:38,160
I don't care. Are you looking down on me...

351
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:40,430
since my life was ruined...

352
00:32:40,430 --> 00:32:43,500
- because of my crazy daughter? - Please calm down.

353
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:45,170
Is that what it is?

354
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:48,200
It's not like that. Please calm down.

355
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:50,039
I'm not looking down on you.

356
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:53,009
Forget it. You better take care of this.

357
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:54,640
Let go of me!

358
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,380
I know you're unhappy with me.

359
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,950
Instead of getting compliments, we now have to be responsible.

360
00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:04,950
30 minutes...

361
00:33:06,019 --> 00:33:08,190
No. Perhaps...

362
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:12,630
we would have saved another person if we were 10 minutes earlier.

363
00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:18,839
That's why I feel responsible...

364
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,740
for the deaths of Yoon Ye Rim and the other innocent victims.

365
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:25,240
However, I won't torture myself.

366
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,880
It's not us who has to repent. It's the murderer.

367
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:30,049
What we should bring to the funerals...

368
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:33,319
isn't cheap tears. We should show them the arrested murderer.

369
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:36,420
That's why for the remaining 72 hours,

370
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:39,519
we'll give our all to find the true culprit.

371
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:43,630
But all of the data say Han Man Pyung did it alone.

372
00:33:43,789 --> 00:33:46,059
There is a 51 percent chance there is an accomplice.

373
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:50,029
Han Man Pyung isn't the type to display murders like this.

374
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,440
What type of person is the real criminal?

375
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,509
(Max Weber, the German sociologist, analyzed three types of...)

376
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,779
"Charisma"?

377
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,950
Someone from the upper class who has charisma.

378
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:06,279
"Upper class"?

379
00:34:06,579 --> 00:34:10,349
Han Man Pyung has low self-esteem, so he admired success.

380
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:12,860
If there is the main criminal who moved such a person,

381
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:15,289
I'm certain they're someone successful.

382
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:18,800
Han Man Pyung is a typical pawn...

383
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,300
who acts in place of someone superior.

384
00:34:20,559 --> 00:34:24,000
All of my experiences and knowledge draw towards this conclusion.

385
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,599
What is our investigation target?

386
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:26,969
The real criminal...

387
00:34:28,269 --> 00:34:29,769
must be in this villa complex.

388
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:31,909
It's 1.5km away.

389
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:33,480
If one travels through the mountain,

390
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,010
they can move from one place to another in 15 minutes.

391
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:39,420
The real criminal must be among these 80 villas.

392
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,889
The chances are very high.

393
00:34:43,789 --> 00:34:44,849
Excuse me.

394
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:46,889
- We'll investigate in two ways. - Who is the owner of this villa?

395
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,119
- One. - I'm not sure.

Let's go.

398
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:57,329
Two. No matter how much they moved in secret,

399
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:58,800
there has to be a witness.

400
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:01,199
Investigate the path through the forest thoroughly.

401
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,789
What is it?

402
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,659
- Yes? - We found a land...

403
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:28,829
that was bought under Han Man Pyung's deceased mother.

404
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,730
Like you said, the place is located halfway up the mountain path.

405
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,739
- It's on the path? - Yes.

I'll send you a map with a marking on it.

That's right. According to what was reported,

District Attorney Lim Joong Yeon...

441

has been accepting illegal sexual favors.

442

The problem is that the woman involved...

was one of the victims of Han Man Pyung's case.

disturbed the police investigation which led to more victims.

00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,989
We finished our search and couldn't find anything special.

495
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,260
The result is out.

496
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,630
We found a different DNA on the cigarette butt.

497
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,000
- Do you know who? - We found out who.

498
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,900
We found a matching DNA in our ex-convict data.

499
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,369
The name is Kwak Hee Ju.

500
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:33,500
The address is in Onsang-ri.

501
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:36,239
- Is it one of the villas? - No.

502
00:40:36,239 --> 00:40:38,039
It's a remote house in the mountain.

503
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,409
A remote house?

504
00:40:40,409 --> 00:40:42,809
(3, Onsang-ro 12-gil, Daegyung-myeon)

505
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:44,679
(Seoju, Gyeonggi Province)

506
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,510
Everyone, surround it.

507
00:42:03,059 --> 00:42:06,130
When can we start talking to Bo Hyeon?

508
00:42:06,530 --> 00:42:08,960
She's still mentally unstable.

509
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:11,269
You have to wait if you want to talk to her.

510
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:20,880
Where are you going?

511
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:26,150
Are you running away?

512
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:30,650
Mr. Superpower.

513
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:33,760
Why do you care?

514
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:35,789
I came to ask for your help.

515
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:38,190
- It'll be difficult, but... - I already said...

516
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:41,130
I didn't see any accomplices.

517
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:45,699
All right. I believe you.

518
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:48,900
If you do, go away.

519
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,739
You and your power are annoying.

520
00:42:52,739 --> 00:42:53,980
It wasn't your fault.

521
00:42:56,409 --> 00:42:57,650
I want you to know that.

522
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,550
It wasn't your fault.

523
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:05,619
Even if you didn't make the right choice,

524
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:08,289
it wasn't solely your fault,

525
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:11,030
so don't blame yourself.

526
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,329
Then whose fault is it?

527
00:43:20,739 --> 00:43:23,969
I grew up like garbage under my garbage parents!

528
00:43:25,510 --> 00:43:26,880
Whose fault is it?

529
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:31,349
I don't know...

530
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:35,150
why good people must be unhappy...

531
00:43:35,849 --> 00:43:38,219
and why innocent people must die so tragically either.

532
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:39,420
All I know...

533
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,989
is that you're not old enough to take all the responsibility.

534
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,329
That's something you can do...

535
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:49,159
after you grow up.

536
00:44:13,190 --> 00:44:15,159
(Personal Details, Kwak Hee Ju)

537
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:19,599
Did you and Han Man Pyung meet up often in his hut?

538
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,329
From time to time.

539
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:25,530
- "From time to time"? - It's been quite a while.

540
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:27,800
He didn't use it, so I borrowed it.

541
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:29,099
What did you two do?

542
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:32,210
We drank tea and talked.

543
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,280
What else?

544
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,610
We had a religious discussion.

545
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,550
Why you little punk...

546
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:39,880
Does a religious man even smoke?

547
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,789
Man Pyung said exactly the same thing.

548
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:48,760
He was narrow-minded, just like his religious beliefs.

549
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,829
He was obsessed with some weird cult.

550
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,500
I heard you were the one who got kicked out...

551
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,800
several times for saying strange things.

552
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,130
With some bizarre stories.

553
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:58,500
Aren't you a member of a cult?

554
00:45:01,199 --> 00:45:02,400
And who defines that?

555
00:45:03,139 --> 00:45:04,570
Biased believers?

556
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:12,280
Enlightenment is an intimate thing.

557
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:18,050
The intimate agreement between me and the whole universe.

558
00:45:18,449 --> 00:45:19,989
Intimate, my foot.

559
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:24,329
Is this something like that too?

560
00:45:24,329 --> 00:45:27,059
Gosh, you sexually harassed girls so intimately.

561
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:28,829
You even spent six months in prison.

562
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:30,469
You have two records of sexual abuse.

563
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:36,909
I've been framed.

564
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:39,170
This is blackmail.

565
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:42,139
You seem like a very confident man.

566
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:46,280
You're so confident that you'll save the world. I'm truly curious.

567
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:48,820
Whether you'll be able to save yourself...

568
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:50,949
let alone the world.

569
00:46:20,119 --> 00:46:21,949
If only I got there a bit faster.

570
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:25,090
I heard...

571
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:28,090
you tried your best.

572
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:31,730
I'm sorry.

573
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,829
I was about to go out and meet her...

574
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:41,340
but I fell asleep.

575
00:46:43,110 --> 00:46:45,639
I woke up startled and called her,

576
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,780
but she already got off the bus.

577
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:55,519
I should've still went out to see her.

578
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,320
But I was tired...

579
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:03,230
and made an excuse that I had to go to work early...

580
00:47:04,929 --> 00:47:06,500
and stayed in bed.

581
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:12,630
It's all my fault...

582
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:16,769
that my daughter ended up like that.

583
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:24,909
All she did was suffer...

584
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:27,750
because of a foolish mom.

585
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:32,920
She died so miserably...

586
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:36,730
That's not true.

587
00:47:43,670 --> 00:47:46,099
I hope there is a paradise up there for her.

588
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,639
Even if I can't go there,

589
00:47:50,239 --> 00:47:51,710
I know my kind daughter...

590
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:55,440
will go there for sure.

591
00:48:08,420 --> 00:48:10,630
We have to go. Now.

592
00:48:14,699 --> 00:48:16,369
The RIU is interrogating the real culprit.

593
00:48:16,869 --> 00:48:17,929
Real culprit?

594
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:19,570
You suspected there was a real culprit too.

595
00:48:19,769 --> 00:48:20,840
A warrant has been issued.

596
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,909
Why don't you come clean now?

597
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:33,849
A search warrant has been issued, so we'll find everything now.

598
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:36,289
Phone records, where you went,

599
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:38,190
and how you instigated Han Man Pyung.

600
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:43,789
Did you get a warrant for my server?

601
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,300
What server?

602
00:48:48,699 --> 00:48:51,429
- The internet broadcast. - What do you mean?

603
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:53,969
You didn't even investigate?

604
00:48:54,099 --> 00:48:55,639
You punk, what are you talking about?

605
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:57,469
I did a personal broadcast.

606
00:48:58,170 --> 00:48:59,510
For 40 days.

607
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:02,179
What?

608
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:06,250
He has no charisma.

609
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:14,090
Hello, sir.

610
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:27,840
What is it?

611
00:49:29,969 --> 00:49:31,409
Didn't you come to tell me something?

612
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:39,480
You were...

613
00:49:40,719 --> 00:49:41,820
wrong.

614
00:49:46,989 --> 00:49:48,159
It's my responsibility.

615
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:52,889
It's all my fault.

616
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,000
What do you mean?

617
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:59,300
It's all my fault...

618
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,639
that she died like that.

619
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:16,050
Take me with you.

620
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:22,489
Please save me.

621
00:50:26,329 --> 00:50:27,559
No!

622
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:31,400
You asked about my religion.

623
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,199
This is always my answer.

624
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:35,900
My one and only religion...

625
00:50:36,269 --> 00:50:39,840
It's true. He did a non-stop internet broadcast for 40 days.

626
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,909
But he barely had any viewers.

627
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:44,380
There's even a video of him sleeping.

628
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:46,420
Check the longest time he was away from the screen.

629
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,719
Check Tuesday first.

630
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:57,960
- How did it go? - Where's the suspect?

631
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,130
They're checking his alibi now.

632
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:05,030
Hey. What are you doing here?

633
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,239
Hey, hey. Stop!

634
00:51:10,639 --> 00:51:11,940
He barged in suddenly without approval.

635
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:18,250
He went to the bathroom after eating...

636
00:51:18,349 --> 00:51:19,780
but came back within 15 minutes.

637
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:21,050
15 minutes?

638
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:23,349
That's enough time to go back and forth between the farm.

639
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:24,820
He could've killed them within that time.

640
00:51:25,019 --> 00:51:26,190
- That's true. - No.

641
00:51:27,019 --> 00:51:29,320
Murder is a very important ritual for the culprit.

642
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:31,760
There's no way he did it in a minute or two.

643
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:34,500
Do you mean he's not the real culprit?

644
00:51:36,030 --> 00:51:38,199
He didn't have it from the beginning.

645
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:39,400
Let me tell you about my enlightenment.

646
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:42,699
The charisma to move Han Man Pyung.

647
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:45,809
The selected few viewers in this room...

648
00:51:46,579 --> 00:51:47,940
will one day...

649
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:52,780
become the historic individuals that will...

650
00:51:53,679 --> 00:51:55,519
shoulder my hardships.

651
00:51:59,489 --> 00:52:00,719
What will happen now?

652
00:52:00,889 --> 00:52:02,860
What do you think? We all go home.

653
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,460
Son, I'll be home soon.

654
00:52:08,829 --> 00:52:10,230
Hey, kiddo.

655
00:52:10,769 --> 00:52:12,769
Uncle Dong Baek isn't coming with you?

656
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,599
He's going home.

657
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:16,909
I bragged to my friends...

658
00:52:16,909 --> 00:52:18,840
that he was going to sleep at our house.

659
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,610
I really like Uncle Dong Baek too,

660
00:52:21,940 --> 00:52:24,449
but I can't spend more than 52 hours a week with him.

661
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:25,909
Why not?

662
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:27,679
When I'm with him, all my hair falls out.

663
00:52:28,179 --> 00:52:30,219
Since his superpower is so amazing.

664
00:52:30,219 --> 00:52:31,789
- Okay? Sure. - Hurry home.

665
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:35,690
What about that girl's memory?

666
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:42,230
Too bad. We didn't get to chat.

667
00:52:46,269 --> 00:52:47,369
You may leave.

668
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:49,840
You don't have to apologize. Since it's the truth.

669
00:52:55,179 --> 00:52:57,110
- What? - You don't have to apologize...

670
00:52:57,309 --> 00:52:58,780
for arresting an innocent person.

671
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:02,119
No, I mean what you said after that.

672
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:05,050
What? The truth?

673
00:53:06,119 --> 00:53:08,659
The profound goal of the universe that moves all creations.

674
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:12,159
- "Truth". - All the girls who died...

675
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:14,030
followed the truth.

676
00:53:14,929 --> 00:53:16,460
Even if they died gruesomely.

677
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:19,500
In the eyes of the Lord, everything has a meaning...

678
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:23,070
I was talking to her.

679
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:29,309
Detective Superpower?

680
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,510
I knew we'd meet.

Only blessed people like us...

682
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:40,820
- How dare these jerks... - Sir.

683
00:53:41,559 --> 00:53:43,989
Where did the kids riding the scooters go?

684
00:53:43,989 --> 00:53:45,190
What? I didn't see them.

685
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:48,699
What is it?

686
00:53:50,269 --> 00:53:52,369
- Something's not right. - What?

687
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,570
His voice from the broadcast and his real voice are different.

688
00:53:56,610 --> 00:53:59,239
Well, it might get distorted through a microphone and speaker...

689
00:53:59,239 --> 00:54:00,340
It'll totally sound different.

690
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,840
His voice was different in the girl's memory.

691
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:04,510
What do you mean?

692
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:06,480
Your death will truly...

693
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:08,349
The doctrine lecture they heard when they were locked up.

694
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:09,989
There was a moment when the voice of the lecturer...

695
00:54:09,989 --> 00:54:11,550
sounded different from usual.

696
00:54:11,690 --> 00:54:14,590
There is nothing you can do in front of fear...

697
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:15,719
but struggle in pain,

698
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,090
- Please save me. - and your death will truly...

699
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:21,130
The lecture they heard during the murders was the same voice,

700
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:22,929
but it was different from the DVD.

701
00:54:23,630 --> 00:54:26,269
- What? - He was actually in the next room.

that was lecturing in the DVD.

00:54:45,389 --> 00:54:46,519

Has anyone seen the word, "Truth"?

- Sorry? - I'm certain I saw it,

714
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:22,559
- but I can't find it. - Then it's not in our data.

- But what does this mean? - Okay.

728

It wasn't this picture.
