Yes.

It's nothing to be scared of.

for giving us rain.

there was thunder too.

Same with the day we left Mom
at the columbarium.

12

Come here.

13
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,080
- Do you miss her?
- Yes.

14
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:30,620
What did she tell you to do...

15
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:33,590
- whenever you missed her?
- To pray.

16
00:02:34,259 --> 00:02:36,729
She's your guardian angel,

17
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:39,099
so whenever you're struggling
or scared, you should...

18
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,370
Pray.

19
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,800
- Should we pray together?
- Yes.

20
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:54,580
The holy guardian angel,

21
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:57,219

25
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:10,460
from the blade of evil.

let me do a roll check, okay?

29
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,469
Do we have Shinai from Israel?

30

Here.

Simon Parker from the US.

32
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,610
- Here.
- Okay.

00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,849
Thomas Jaeger from Germany.

34
00:03:29,849 --> 00:03:31,120
It's "Jaeger", not "Jaeger".

35
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:32,879
Okay. I'm sorry.

36
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,590
Thomas Jaeger from Germany. Okay.

37
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,319
Next is...

38
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,060

The Lord has sent you to me.

42

Please protect my body
from the blade of evil...

43
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:26,639
and lead me out of
the deep darkness...

Dad.

48
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,629
Mom, I won the gold medal.

49
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:40,430
The holy guardian angel,

50
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,699

51

How did you know I was here?

56
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,740
I hurried over
because I was worried about you.

57
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,579
This is live ammunition.

58
00:08:24,939 --> 00:08:26,040
How did you know I was here?

59
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:28,009
The situation room told me
you'd be here.

60
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:30,110
You arrived here sooner than my men.

61
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,980
It's as if you'd been waiting.

62
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,820
I can't take this any longer.

63
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,519
Be careful. One pull of the trigger,
and you'll shoot me.

64
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:43,629
The numbers next to the body.

65
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:46,629
They led me to a sanitarium nearby.

66
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:49,029
Professor Nam Young Moon.

67

Kim So Mi from 20 years ago...

68
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,940
changed her name to Han Sun Mi.

69
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:06,919
You secretly read my memory.

70
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,120
You reenacted the murder scene
after reading it.

71
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,259
That's enough.

72
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:15,360
Explain it.

73
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,059
Calm down.

74
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,860
When I scan people's memories,

75
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
I don't absorb all of it
by the slight touch of our bodies.

76
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,870
When you grabbed me,

77
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,169
I was so focused on reading
Park Gi Dan's...

78
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:26,440
that I didn't read any of yours.

79
00:09:26,669 --> 00:09:27,740
Who knows?

80
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,409
Fine. I saw a vague afterimage.

81
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,639
The traumatic events are read first.

82
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,019
It was a dark shape.

83
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,389
It looked like some sort
of black vase.

84
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,159
- So?
- When I read Prof. Nam's memory,

85
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:48,289
I saw that So Mi drew
the same shape.

86
00:09:48,389 --> 00:09:51,529
She had witnessed the murder
through a keyhole.

87
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,860
That's when I found out...

88
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,399
that she was you.

89
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:00,909
That sounds absolutely ridiculous.

90
00:10:01,169 --> 00:10:02,509
I'm pretty keen.

91
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:05,009
The killer is playing
a gruesome joke.

92
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:06,740
They used my past.

93
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:09,179
And who's capable of doing that?

94
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:12,120
It's true that the killer
spat on your face...

95
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,149
and threw down the gauntlet.

96
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:16,820
But you're not the only one
who was spat on.

97
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,220
He also insulted...

98
00:10:21,129 --> 00:10:22,190
my past.

99
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,559
What past?

100
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,360
The killer is after both of us.

101
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,740
If you don't answer my question,

102
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,269
I'll pull this trigger.

103
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,720
This claw hammer painting
was delivered to Park Gi Dan.

104
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:54,990
So?

105
00:10:57,129 --> 00:10:58,330
I don't know if you've heard,

106
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,470
but I have no recollection
of my past.

107
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,669
Cut to the chase.

108
00:11:03,129 --> 00:11:04,740
I can only remember one thing.

109
00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:08,639
It's a girl.

110
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,980
She's dying.

111
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,549
It was identical to the painting.

112
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,720
The position of the man
who was stepped on by the angel.

113
00:11:18,419 --> 00:11:19,480
The face.

114
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,820
The sad expression.

115
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:27,259
She was probably my mom.

116
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,429
He ridiculed the only memory I had.

117

118

a mutual enemy.

119

- This way.

00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,370
- Go.
- Me?

122

Go!

123
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,570
- It's locked.
- Move aside.

124

Captain Koo.

125
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:08,529
Why didn't you open the door?

126
00:13:09,659 --> 00:13:12,000
Stay outside. The forensics team
needs to come first.

They're human?

129
00:13:16,669 --> 00:13:18,269
They're the killer's work.

130
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,639
"Work"?

131
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,970
Judging by the wounds on the arms,
they were attacking each other.

132
00:13:27,549 --> 00:13:29,679
- "Each other"?
- But why?

133
00:13:30,009 --> 00:13:31,320
The killer probably told them...

134
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,549
that the sole survivor
would be spared.

So who's the killer?

147
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:00,100
He has a scar on his left ear.

148
00:15:00,139 --> 00:15:01,710
You already said that
a long time ago.

Use these to track him down.

150

You will find the man with the scar.

Why should this be a secret?

152

Because the killer is nearby.

The killer...

154
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:32,940
maybe the same one
who had murdered our parents.

155

- But what if...

he found out about our pasts
by accident?

"Close"?
Then could it be a detective?

You are pretty cautious.

until the end.

168
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,269
Who is it?

169
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:12,740
If you don't tell me,
I can't narrow down the scenarios.

170
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,879
But...

171
00:16:14,549 --> 00:16:16,610
do you always consider
so many scenarios...

172
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:18,049
when you investigate?

173
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,450
Despite being so smart,
do you lack intuition?

174
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,490
That's only for those
who are selfish.

175
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,019
You let luck make
the important decisions.

176
00:16:26,659 --> 00:16:28,990
I'm sure mouth-breathers like you
enjoy doing that.

177
00:16:29,659 --> 00:16:32,399
So is that why I saved your life?

178
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,899
- What do you...
- Han Man Pyung.

179
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:39,299
- Oh, that?
- "Oh, that"?

180
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,340
I would've managed on my own.

181
00:16:44,779 --> 00:16:46,409
And yet, I was thankful
that you removed me...

182
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:47,779
from the suspect list.

183
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:49,179
Who did?

184
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,250
- Am I wrong?
- Of course.

185
00:16:51,649 --> 00:16:53,820
You're still a usual suspect.

186
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,750
Then what?

187
00:16:56,049 --> 00:16:57,450
Are you saying
you want to join hands...

188
00:16:57,450 --> 00:16:58,820
with a key suspect?

189
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,190
"Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer."

190
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,330
This is something I believe in.

191
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:07,160
Don't forget...

192
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,299
that all of this needs
to be a secret...

193
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:10,930
between us.

194
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,029
What are you doing?

195
00:17:35,029 --> 00:17:36,390
Is this your first time
at a woman's house?

196
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,630
Don't be ridiculous.

197
00:17:40,099 --> 00:17:42,730
I frequently go to women's houses...

198
00:17:43,069 --> 00:17:44,500
all the time.

199
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:06,660
Come to my room.

200
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:32,880
What are these?

201
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,450
They're related to my case.

202
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,190
I've been updating
for the past 20 years.

203
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,599
(Safety and Happiness,
Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency)

204
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,029
Do you even know how much I spent?

205
00:18:52,599 --> 00:18:54,470
You said I should buy it.
You were certain.

206
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,240
Isn't that the same thing
as telling me to buy it?

207
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,279
You're unbelievable.

208
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,950
You must think the team leader
of RIU's Violent Crimes...

209
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,950
only chases after murderers,

210
00:19:06,049 --> 00:19:07,119
don't you?

211
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,619
Fine, then.

212
00:19:08,619 --> 00:19:12,619
Just watch what I'll do
with fraudsters like you.

213
00:19:13,259 --> 00:19:16,660
If you don't give me back my money,
your life's over.

214
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,210
Just leave.

215
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:29,869
What about the investigation?

216
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,410
Shouldn't you be studying?

217
00:19:31,509 --> 00:19:33,480
I got into public administration
at Seoul National University.

218
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:36,150
Good for you.

219
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,150
Did you check the suspects?

220
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,880
That's enough!

221
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,019
Do you know how many cases we have?

222
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,990
I have way too many culprits
to catch!

223
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,259
Nothing is more important
than murder cases!

224
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,460
How dare you?

225
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,990
Just assign one detective.
If you do, then I'll...

226
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,579
Leave.

227
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:19,460
I'll do it myself.

228
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,059
I'll bring the killer here myself!

229
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:26,529
Why that little...

230
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:29,529
Why do you think the killer
who murdered our parents came back?

231
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,200
You're making presumptions.
That's intuition right there.

232
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,640
I'm more focused
on the killer's intention.

233
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,640
What intention?

234
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,140
Serial killing is dangerous
for the killer.

235
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,140
And yet, he used the bodies
as bait...

236
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,650
and ridiculed our pasts.

237
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,950
What could it be?

238
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,180
What could the killer gain...

239
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,319
by committing murder
and ridiculing us?

240
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,720
Is he bragging
about the perfect crime...

241
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,819
from 20 years ago?

242
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:56,230
That's just not worth it.

243
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:59,559
Hold on. I think you got off
on the wrong foot.

244
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:00,960
A lunatic doesn't have reasoning.

245
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,569
You're just making it
more difficult to catch the killer.

246
00:21:02,829 --> 00:21:05,900
We need to acknowledge
that he's above us...

247
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,210
then we'll be able to find
his weak point.

248
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,769
This is the thing with profilers.

249
00:21:11,339 --> 00:21:15,109
You give more credit to the criminal
and end up going the wrong way.

250
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,279
The killer brought up a murder
from 20 years ago.

251
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:22,549
We'll act like we're playing along
while looking for his weakness...

252
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,519
Careful not to get into
the camera's angle.

253
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,359
Senior Superintendent Han, we have
the information on the victims.

254
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:30,960
They were both in their 20s.

255
00:21:31,130 --> 00:21:33,660
Do you know about the
youth double jeopardy case?

256
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,099
"Youth"...

257
00:21:35,099 --> 00:21:36,529
Those jerks...

258
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,339
Six years ago, an orphan girl died.

259
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,640
The murderers turned out to be
middle school girls.

260
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:44,069
They visited the orphanage
for volunteer hours...

261
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:45,380
until they killed the young girl.

262
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,180
They claimed they killed
out of jealousy...

263
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,650
because their crush
was nice to the young girl.

264
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:50,349
The problem happened afterward.

265
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,279
They were both 14 years old.

266
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:55,049
They were criminal minors,
so they weren't penalized.

267
00:21:55,289 --> 00:21:56,289
Scumbags.

268
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:58,559
In five years,
something new came into light.

269
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:01,220
A screen capture of the two
assailants' chat went around.

270
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,859
They were mocking the dead child.

271
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,200
"It was so funny when she died"?

272
00:22:09,369 --> 00:22:11,970
The public demanded
the girls to stand before the court,

273
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,769
but because of the prohibition
against double jeopardy...

274
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:17,640
The assailants had their law firms
charge those who spoke against them.

275
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,809
How does this make sense?

276
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,049
Who's beside you?

277
00:22:25,519 --> 00:22:26,579
Do you have the autopsy result?

278
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:29,890
Are you with a man? At this hour?

279
00:22:30,289 --> 00:22:33,259
Like you anticipated, we assume
they attacked each other.

280
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:34,420
I heard a male voice.

281
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:36,190
Report to me
as soon as you have updates.

282
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:37,529
Yes, ma'am!

283
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,759
- It was a man, right?
- What if it is?

284
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,599
It could be dangerous
if a bad guy attacks her.

285
00:22:42,799 --> 00:22:44,529
If he doesn't attack her
when they're alone,

286
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,940
- he'd really be a bad guy.
- Come on.

287
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,140
She's not like that.

288
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,170
Wake up. She's going to quit
being a professor soon.

289
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:54,539
How much longer will you keep her
as your crush?

290
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,250
What crush? It's respect.

291
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:59,650
I see. Respect.

292
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:04,390
The break is almost over,
so get ready to become an officer.

293
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:06,019
Enough with drooling over her.

294
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:08,660
It really was a man.

295
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,759
He must be a celebrity.

296
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,200
It was from the television.
It had to be television.

297
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,569
No. I mean a real celebrity.

298
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:17,930
With her good looks,
Senior Superintendent Han...

299
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,269
must have celebrities
lined up for her.

300
00:23:23,769 --> 00:23:25,410
He had a nice voice, right?

301
00:23:25,509 --> 00:23:27,809
He had a sexy voice.

302
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:29,549
I bet he's handsome.

303
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:40,619
He's eliminating devils
in a devilish way.

304
00:23:41,589 --> 00:23:43,130
What an unprecedented psycho.

305
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,359
This is not the first time.

306
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:47,960
There was such a case 20 years ago.

307
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:50,029
The executor's murder case.

308
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:53,369
"Executor"?

309
00:24:03,579 --> 00:24:05,849
Excuse me, where is
Reporter Cho Sung Dong's desk?

310
00:24:05,849 --> 00:24:06,849
Over there.

311
00:24:07,849 --> 00:24:08,920
(Reporter Cho Sung Dong)

312
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,910
- So?
- Could...

313
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:32,910
Could you check a couple of things
for me?

314
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,849
It'd help me a lot on closing in
on the criminal.

315
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:38,619
I'm a reporter, not a detective.

316
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:40,119
I know that.

317
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,490
You wrote an exclusive on my dad.

318
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:48,559
Sir, there are more people
aside from my dad.

319
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:51,160
- The exclusive you wrote...
- Hey!

320
00:24:51,799 --> 00:24:53,460
You need to get counseling.

321
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:56,170
Stop being delusional
and go see a psychiatrist.

322
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,099
If you look at the pattern,
it's very likely they're the same...

323
00:25:02,509 --> 00:25:04,640
Stop bothering me, or else...

324
00:25:08,509 --> 00:25:11,210
Hey, you should just help her.

325
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:13,349
Help her with what?
You don't know anything.

326
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,019
She's just a kid.

327
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,549
Don't you know who her father is?

328
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:20,420
She thinks she was wronged,
but she should be ashamed.

329
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:21,990
She'll hear you.

330
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,559
I'm saying it for her to hear.

331
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:27,160
If she knows what her father did,
how can she act like this?

332
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,839
What did you say?
Who did you say is the criminal?

333
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,150
(Personnel Information)

334
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,519
(Name: Cho Sung Dong)

335
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,720
No way. Cho Sung Dong
is a star journalist.

336
00:25:57,329 --> 00:25:59,529
There were five other
similar murders.

337
00:26:00,029 --> 00:26:02,170
People who were criticized
were killed.

338
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:09,609
"Jeonnam dismemberment
murder case".

339
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,509
Look.

340
00:26:12,009 --> 00:26:13,680
Their montages do not match.

341
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,009
The criminal
was a middle-aged woman.

342
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:17,650
Both of them didn't get caught,
but there are no commonalities.

343
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,720
Gosh. You don't know anything.

344
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,880
There is something else in common.

345
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,549
One person wrote the exclusive news
on all the stories.

346
00:26:24,319 --> 00:26:25,460
Cho Sung Dong?

347
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,930
That doesn't mean anything.

348
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,559
That's what
a journalist's job is about.

349
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,130
He was the fastest.
He always got to the scene first.

350
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:37,930
He's a star journalist,
so he has the best connections.

351
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:40,170
No. He was faster.

352
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,710
Dad.

353
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,069
Dad.

354
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,440
Dad. Dad.

355
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,599
He was definitely faster...

356
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,029
than the patrol car
that was dispatched.

357
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,170
Kid, are you okay? Hurry up!

358
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,109
I was too young to notice it then.

359
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,180
You're young even now.

360
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,450
It's impossible
unless he's the criminal.

361
00:28:29,579 --> 00:28:32,150
Am I bewitched by a child?

362
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:35,390
You should've investigated
according to my profiling.

363
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:40,890
Did you suspect him from the start?

364
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:42,460
I already double-checked.

365
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,460
Checked what?

366
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,799
They wanted to drink
and then go to karaoke.

367
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,329
- I ran away last time.
- You know how it is.

368
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,799
- They have a huge problem.
- I'm so exhausted.

369
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:56,269
I'd keep them company
if they weren't such bad drunks.

370
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,210
The Executor.

371
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,480
Who named him?

372
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,579
Me.

373
00:29:07,849 --> 00:29:09,750
You're good at making names.

374
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:13,690
He executed those
who deserved to be...

375
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:21,400
Minus your father.

376
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:28,099
No, you're right.
All of those people were criticized.

377
00:29:29,839 --> 00:29:32,279
The first case was in 1999
on a hiking trail.

378
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,880
"Sister Welfare Center"?

379
00:29:37,049 --> 00:29:40,950
They kidnapped and killed people
to receive support funds.

380
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,250
It was an evil welfare center.

381
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:45,759
Weren't they found guilty by 1999?

382
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,660
They didn't pay their dues.

383
00:29:48,289 --> 00:29:49,759
They were released
in just two years.

384
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:53,200
Wait. Did they only serve
two years for killing hundreds?

385
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:55,059
We were under
a military regime then.

386
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:58,230
They should've been all killed.

387
00:30:03,609 --> 00:30:05,410
It was badly damaged.

388
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:07,140
Why did they damage the body?

389
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,579
No. I mean the trail.

390
00:30:12,019 --> 00:30:15,420
I connected these cases together
not because of the murder intention,

391
00:30:16,089 --> 00:30:17,150
but by the murder method.

392
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:19,259
"Method"?

393
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,559
The victims were punished
while they were alive.

394
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:24,329
For a long time until
they took their last breath.

395
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,000
The statute of limitations expired,
so the victims weren't jailed,

396
00:30:28,599 --> 00:30:30,430
but they were dismembered
while alive.

397
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:33,269
They were cut into exactly 13 parts
which match the number of murders.

398
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:36,309
How meticulous.

399
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,380
It was the same for all of them.

400
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:42,579
They were brutally tortured
until they died.

401
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,549
Why weren't these cases
linked as a serial murder case?

402
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,349
Because the montages
of the suspects were different.

403
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,319
There were witnesses?

404
00:30:50,589 --> 00:30:52,059
In 3 out of the 6 cases.

405
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:15,750
The witness was an old man.

406
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:20,849
For the case in Jeonnam, a woman
in her 50s was caught on camera.

407
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:22,849
What about the third one?

408
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:26,089
I was the witness.

409
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,769
How did your father...

410
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,240
He was stabbed everywhere
aside from his vital points.

411
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,710
He was stabbed 17 times.

412
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,279
"17"?

413
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:55,250
That's the number of people
who died directly and indirectly...

414
00:31:56,319 --> 00:31:58,319
because of my dad.

415
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:03,990
What's the conclusion...

416
00:32:05,299 --> 00:32:06,960
after 20 years of pursuit?

417
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,799
Happy? You can leave now.

418
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,400
No, I'll stay.

419
00:32:12,569 --> 00:32:15,470
You must be joking.
This is not a child's play.

420
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,869
I can detect lies.
I've mastered psychology.

421
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:20,609
No, wait outside.
It'll be settled soon.

422
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:24,549
If I attack his pride,
he'll just collapse. Go on.

423
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:50,269
You're really something, aren't you?

424
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:54,240
It's entertaining.

425
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,549
Gosh. I'm such a fool.

426
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,289
- What happened?
- What do you think?

427
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:08,319
I'm a fool for listening to a child.

428
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,460
- Why?
- He has alibis.

429
00:33:10,730 --> 00:33:13,230
He was with other people
when your dad was murdered.

430
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,569
Alibis don't matter.

431
00:33:17,099 --> 00:33:18,940
He could have accomplices
so he could write exclusives.

432
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:21,400
Who'd murder for exclusives?

433
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:24,039
- You're so immature.
- That's why he's a murderer.

434
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,309
You should check his accomplices.

435
00:33:26,309 --> 00:33:27,339
I already did.

436
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,779
We checked his call records
and tracked his movement.

437
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:33,920
You made me work so much
for nothing.

438
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:36,289
That's impossible.

439
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:38,759
The scar. What about the scar
behind his ear?

440
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:41,019
He got it while serving the army.

441
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:46,130
- That's a lie.
- I even checked his medical record!

442
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,559
What about after that?

443
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:52,599
Knowing you, you'd never
back down so easily.

444
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,910
I believed there might be a trick,

445
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,369
but all the work I did
always ended up in vain.

446
00:33:58,539 --> 00:34:00,279
I researched all the possibilities,

447
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,180
but I was back where I started
every time.

448
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:11,119
What if that trick is a superpower?

449
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:16,889
What if Cho or someone else
can manipulate people's memories...

450
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:19,730
just like what happened
at Park Gi Dan's murder scene?

451
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,570
- They used a sleeping gas.
- It feels more like a trick to me.

452
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,869
Even the guards outside
lost their memories.

453
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:30,909
Or what if...

454
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:34,440
this isn't
a crime caused by a superpower?

455
00:34:38,349 --> 00:34:39,949
Then it must be someone
who can see through everything...

456
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,880
thanks to massive resources.

457
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,789
That...

458
00:34:45,789 --> 00:34:47,519
could be someone in the police too.

459
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,760
The Executor from 20 years ago...

460
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,300
Why do you think
he stopped killing...

461
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,199
and disappeared?

462
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,869
In any case, he came back.

463
00:35:03,039 --> 00:35:04,039
Did you say he came back?

464
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,579
You nagged at me
and said I was prejudice.

465
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:10,510
Making a rash judgment based on
a gut feeling is different...

466
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,610
from having data.

467
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,789
Isn't this near
Yeom Hwa Ran's villa?

468
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,289
This is from a while back.

469
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,159
They say the criminal
always returns to the scene.

470
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,230
That's why we make records.

471
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Did you see him?

472
00:35:32,969 --> 00:35:34,039
No.

473
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,539
There were hardly any onlookers.

474
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,940
- Then what?
- A different uninvited guest.

475
00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:41,679
"An uninvited guest"?

476
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,429
It's a broadcast van.

477
00:35:57,389 --> 00:35:59,699
A broadcast van came
before the police line was placed.

478
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:01,159
It's a repeat
of the exact same thing.

479
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,230
This is the same pattern
from 20 years ago.

480
00:36:06,699 --> 00:36:08,909
(Right Media, Fair Broadcast TVC)

481
00:36:08,909 --> 00:36:11,110
(TVC)

482
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,309
What do you mean?

483
00:36:12,539 --> 00:36:15,039
How did the broadcast van
know to go to the murder scene?

484
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,510
That's what we'd like to know.

485
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,650
We didn't break any embargoes...

486
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:23,289
The broadcast van was out
and ready should anything happen.

487
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:26,219
Do you have a problem understanding,
or are you acting like you don't?

488
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,289
I'm sorry?

489
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:32,360
We're dispatched
when a case happens.

490
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,000
I'm asking how you knew...

491
00:36:36,769 --> 00:36:37,900
about the case.

492
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,639
Is it strange for a reporter
to sniff around a case?

493
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,610
Of course, it is
when you're faster than the police.

494
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,610
On top of that, it happened
multiple times one after another.

495
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,750
You were faster than the police
who were dispatched right away.

496
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,130
Where did you get the tip?

497
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:11,570
We received an anonymous report.

498
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:15,139
Even if we know who it is, we're
entitled to protect the source.

499
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,510
"Anonymous"?

500
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:18,980
Did it ever occur to you...

501
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:22,750
that the anonymous reporter
could be the murderer?

502
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,079
We were fact-checking.

503
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,519
We weren't sure
how credible the report might be.

504
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:32,420
Did you send a broadcasting van
when you haven't fact-checked?

505
00:37:37,659 --> 00:37:38,690
What do you want?

506
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,730
- The identity of your source.
- It's against our morals...

507
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:42,929
to share the source.

508
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:47,239
It was an internal report, right?

509
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,179
They must've received it
from someone high up.

510
00:37:57,610 --> 00:37:58,780
From the very top.

511
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,719
The president.

512
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,960
He's asking just the two people
from the police to come in.

513
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:47,329
- What about me?
- He asked you to be on standby.

514
00:38:48,099 --> 00:38:50,230
Our company lawyer should go in.

515
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:52,539
No. Just the two of them.

516
00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:25,099
It's entertaining.

517
00:39:31,809 --> 00:39:33,880
It's so nice to meet you.

518
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,679
I'm a fan of yours,
so I grilled my employees...

519
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:39,880
to shoot a special on you,
Det. Dong.

520
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,480
It could be a series of 20 episodes.

521
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,750
That would be wonderful.

522
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:50,429
Let's go.

523
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:55,699
The thing is, I have a low ranking
so I have no power.

524
00:39:55,929 --> 00:39:59,139
That goes for starring in shows
as well as arresting criminals.

525
00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:14,750
You're Senior Superintendent Han,
right?

526
00:40:15,619 --> 00:40:16,889
I'm Han Sun Mi.

527
00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:18,219
Of course, I know who you are.

528
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:22,219
Everyone wants to scout you
because you have good leadership.

529
00:40:22,929 --> 00:40:25,489
- Are you interested in politics?
- I like what I do now.

530
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:28,059
I'm sure the job is rewarding.

531
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:30,769
But if you're capable,
it doesn't matter what suits you.

532
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:32,500
You should learn
how to carry more weight.

533
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,840
You know Park Gi Dan died, right?

534
00:40:34,769 --> 00:40:36,110
I believe it's under embargo.

535
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:39,239
Our country
loves embargoes too much.

536
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:42,650
In an advanced society,
it's important to have transparency.

537
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:45,380
That's also the job of the media.

538
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:46,980
I wonder where
that transparent information...

539
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,250
about the murder came from.

540
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,349
What? Is there such a thing?

541
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,360
You should be honest...

542
00:40:54,389 --> 00:40:57,230
since we're in an advanced society.
Be transparent.

543
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,730
You can't demand it from me
just like that. It's a trade secret.

544
00:41:04,230 --> 00:41:05,329
Should I make a guess?

545
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,570
You received tips about murders
from a serial murderer.

546
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:12,610
And it wasn't your first time.

547
00:41:12,909 --> 00:41:14,840
Since your scoops
from 20 years ago...

548
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,480
was all thanks to your
collusion with the murderer.

549
00:41:18,949 --> 00:41:21,250
What? "Collusion"?

550
00:41:21,650 --> 00:41:24,289
Or maybe you made an accomplice
commit murder.

551
00:41:24,889 --> 00:41:26,190
In order to come up with a scoop.

552
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:29,059
Your imagination is
getting out of hand.

553
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,230
Come clean now.

554
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:34,199
If you don't tell us honestly,

555
00:41:34,199 --> 00:41:35,869
you'll be arrested
for conspiracy to murder.

556
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:42,099
Even if I received information,
what's the problem with that?

557
00:41:42,099 --> 00:41:44,769
All I did was go to a scene
where a murder had already occurred.

558
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:46,380
Are you kidding me right now?

559
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,610
If you reported that to the police,

560
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:50,250
we could've saved people
from being killed 20 years ago.

561
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,719
The police knew about it too.

562
00:41:57,889 --> 00:41:59,420
I guess you wanted to dig up
some information...

563
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:00,889
by threatening me about my past.

564
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:02,289
But you're totally mistaken.

565
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,929
If you expose that, and not me,
you'll be the ones who get hurt.

566
00:42:06,699 --> 00:42:09,269
The police knew?

567
00:42:09,530 --> 00:42:11,630
You think the police back then
were all idiots?

568
00:42:12,099 --> 00:42:13,170
They knew already.

569
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,809
- Does that make sense?
- What choice do they have?

570
00:42:16,869 --> 00:42:17,940
They had to cover it up.

571
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:20,579
What kind of police would reveal
the truth about a serial murder...

572
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:21,840
that they couldn't even solve?

573
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:23,280
That would just ruin their careers.

574
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:27,750
Back then and even still,
that's how the police are.

575
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:31,789
How dare you when you colluded
with a murderer for a darned scoop?

576
00:42:31,789 --> 00:42:34,059
What do you mean, colluded?
Not at all.

577
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,630
The culprit wanted the world
to know.

578
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:39,860
That he was getting rid of
the people who deserved to die.

579
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,829
But I didn't agree.

580
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,500
Of course, it would've been
an amazing scoop...

581
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:46,269
if I revealed the truth
about the serial murders.

582
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:49,710
But I had the spirit of a reporter
within me.

583
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:53,510
Unlike you, who cover up everything
in case you fail to get promoted.

584
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:55,909
Spirit of a reporter?

585
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,710
No.

586
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:00,380
You were waiting for the right time
to connect it with the murders.

587
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:05,289
But the police found out,
and your plan failed.

588
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,190
I envy the police.

589
00:43:07,659 --> 00:43:09,090
You exaggerate things as you please.

590
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:11,530
That's the privilege
jerks like you enjoy.

591
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,230
Show the visitors out.

592
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,969
Give us information
on the informant.

593
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:23,010
How dare you demand
information about my stories?

594
00:43:23,239 --> 00:43:25,409
If you must know,
go search through past records.

595
00:43:25,670 --> 00:43:29,380
I'm sure they're much more accurate
than what you guys are thinking.

596
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,420
I was always curious...

597
00:43:37,989 --> 00:43:40,360
if the press was this filthy
because of the world,

598
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:44,530
or if the world became this filthy
because of the press.

599
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,760
Thanks to you,
now I know the answer.

600
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:07,920
(Document storage)

601
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:21,900
- Yes.
- There are no records left...

602
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:23,099
on Kim So Mi from 20 years ago.

603
00:44:23,429 --> 00:44:25,800
Forget the records. Who was
in charge of the investigation?

604
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,369
(Old Man)

605
00:44:27,369 --> 00:44:29,809
The leader of the Gyeonggi Precinct
RIU back then...

606
00:44:29,809 --> 00:44:32,340
was Cheon Ki Soo,
and we knew each other.

607
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,440
He's a chief at
the headquarters now. Why?

608
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:35,610
It's not him.

609
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,750
Make me a copy of the
investigation team member list.

610
00:44:38,750 --> 00:44:39,750
What do you need that for?

611
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:42,820
- Just do as I say...
- I'm your boss, you punk!

612
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,719
I'm your superior
who oversees you.

613
00:44:44,989 --> 00:44:47,820
How dare you order me around
like a dog without even telling me?

614
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:50,530
There you go again.
What is it, a lovers' quarrel?

615
00:44:51,289 --> 00:44:54,730
I just have some questions to ask
the investigators.

616
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,500
The case was forwarded to the
Special Investigation Team later.

617
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:58,530
You want that list too?

618
00:44:59,869 --> 00:45:01,670
- Special Investigation Team?
- Yes.

619
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,469
They gathered some cold cases
besides Kim So Mi's case...

620
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:05,539
and carried out a reinvestigation.

621
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,679
Oh, really?

622
00:45:09,809 --> 00:45:11,480
I already called Cheon Ki Soo.

623
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:12,849
Since there were barely any records.

624
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:15,320
But he kept mentioning
the Special Investigation Team.

625
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:17,250
Saying he didn't know
since he wasn't in charge anymore.

626
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:18,920
What about their records then?

627
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:20,219
There's nothing.

628
00:45:20,219 --> 00:45:21,989
The Special Investigation Team
was disbanded...

629
00:45:21,989 --> 00:45:24,659
and everyone returned
to their original stations.

630
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,929
After making this storage room,
they say this is all there is left.

631
00:45:26,929 --> 00:45:28,030
Who knows?

632
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:30,400
Maybe they lacked information
from the beginning...

633
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,329
or they lost a whole box
full of records.

634
00:45:32,699 --> 00:45:33,900
That happened often
back in the days.

635
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:37,570
There are no records at all from
the Special Investigation Team?

636
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:39,909
All I found was a bunch of
meaningless notes.

637
00:45:40,139 --> 00:45:41,340
The investigator in charge was...

638
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:45,010
What?

639
00:45:46,449 --> 00:45:47,550
It was Deputy Chief Lee.

640
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:49,789
Lee Shin Woong?

641
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,519
Yes. He's number two of
the National Police Agency.

642
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:53,619
(Special Investigation Team
for Cold Cases)

643
00:45:53,619 --> 00:45:54,719
(Chief Superintendent
Lee Shin Woong)

644
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:00,130
(Deputy Chief Lee Shin Woong)

645
00:46:09,539 --> 00:46:16,949
(Deputy Chief Lee Shin Woong)

646
00:46:23,289 --> 00:46:26,420
Captain, did you borrow money
from Baek?

647
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:31,659
Or did he read your memory...

648
00:46:32,190 --> 00:46:33,329
and get a hold of your weakness?

649
00:46:34,699 --> 00:46:36,400
What are you talking about suddenly?

650
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:39,599
You're so soft around him.
It's so fishy.

651
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:40,769
I'm not soft to him.

652
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,940
"Old Man, get me the files
of cold cases."

653
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:47,139
Then you wag your tail like
a dog chasing a tennis ball.

654
00:46:48,179 --> 00:46:50,309
That's how a commanding officer
should be like.

655
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:52,809
Always setting an example,
like Admiral Yi Sun Sin.

656
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:57,889
I doubt Admiral Yi Sun Sin would've
made copies though.

657
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:01,989
If there were copy machines
at his time,

658
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:04,590
he would've made copies
all day long.

659
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:08,900
Now I know what you're like.

660
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:10,630
What?

661
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:14,769
A loyal servant.

662
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:22,480
"I've made the copy, master."

663
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:23,949
Shut your mouth
before I kick you out of the car.

664
00:47:33,489 --> 00:47:35,190
(Special Investigation Team
for Cold Cases)

665
00:47:37,130 --> 00:47:38,389
Do you think Deputy Chief Lee
could be...

666
00:47:38,929 --> 00:47:40,059
the person you mentioned?

667
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,269
A person who sees through everything
with a vast amount of resources.

668
00:47:44,630 --> 00:47:46,030
It's very likely.

669
00:47:47,269 --> 00:47:48,269
On the other hand,

670
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,639
what if they just covered it up
after the investigation failed?

671
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,110
That's possible as well.

672
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,409
Since the investigation team
back then hit a dead end.

673
00:47:56,510 --> 00:47:57,610
The murders also stopped.

674
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,420
Let's start digging into
Deputy Chief Lee then.

675
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:03,489
- How?
- We can confront him head-on...

676
00:48:03,489 --> 00:48:04,590
or follow him secretly.

677
00:48:05,219 --> 00:48:06,260
Deputy Chief Lee commands...

678
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,719
the Police Intelligence Agency
like his personal army.

679
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:09,190
The Police Intelligence Agency?

680
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:11,760
The Police Intelligence Agency has
more connections than the NIS.

681
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:12,960
At least, in our country.

682
00:48:13,699 --> 00:48:16,429
Before we get a chance,
we'll be caught first.

683
00:48:17,070 --> 00:48:18,170
What do we do then?

684
00:48:18,769 --> 00:48:19,969
We need to find a way.

685
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:23,239
Although we're back at square one,
we have a lead.

686
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,769
- A new target named Lee Shin Woong.
- How could you be so carefree?

687
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,710
A serial murderer is on the loose.

688
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,340
When will we come up with a way,
check Lee Shin Woong,

689
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,610
and catch the culprit?

690
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:44,429
Square one...

691
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:47,800
Square one.

692
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:50,699
We were forgetting about square one.

693
00:48:51,730 --> 00:48:53,599
The initial moment we began
to pursue the Executor.

694
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,809
We have a witness.

695
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:58,869
A witness who clearly saw
the Executor.

696
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:02,909
That's...

697
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:05,550
Right.

698
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:08,650
It's you.

699
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,019
My memory?

700
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:24,070
My memory is already
written down on a document.

701
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,400
There's no need to scan my memory.

702
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:37,949
Do you know why I didn't
close my eyes when my dad died?

703
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:39,679
I wanted to remember.

704
00:49:39,949 --> 00:49:42,420
To remember every single detail
of that horrible sight...

705
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:44,050
and never forget.

706
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:46,019
I can't see it anymore.

707
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:49,889
Your sense of boldness
when you offered to shake my hand.

708
00:49:53,829 --> 00:49:55,130
Why don't we check?

709
00:49:56,329 --> 00:49:57,469
In case you missed something.

710
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:03,210
Senior Superintendent Han.

711
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:07,239
I know you hate
investigating with a superpower.

712
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,110
All you believe in
is logic and reason.

713
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:13,250
But...

714
00:50:14,519 --> 00:50:16,750
sometimes, you need to follow
your gut.

715
00:50:17,019 --> 00:50:19,349
The moment someone's life
is taken...

716
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,559
happens not by logic,
but by coincidence.

717
00:50:23,829 --> 00:50:27,199
Just like when you witnessed
that horrible accident.

718
00:50:38,309 --> 00:50:39,909
What do I have to do?

719
00:50:42,679 --> 00:50:43,780
Nothing.

720
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:19,469
A mask.

721
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:21,579
A silicon mask.

722
00:52:24,849 --> 00:52:25,909
Special effects makeup?

723
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:51,269
He made the witnesses
see him intentionally.

724
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:53,039
While changing his face every time.

725
00:52:53,409 --> 00:52:55,940
We need to find special effects
makeup experts from that time.

726
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,050
It will take too long.

727
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:58,679
No, I'm certain we'll find someone.

728
00:53:02,019 --> 00:53:03,079
Wait.

729
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:06,519
Why was it Cho Sung Dong?

730
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,329
Why did the culprit
only tell Cho Sung Dong?

731
00:53:14,630 --> 00:53:17,369
As an executor, he needed to keep
publicizing his murders.

732
00:53:18,170 --> 00:53:20,199
He should've found
a different reporter each time then.

733
00:53:21,869 --> 00:53:23,099
But why...

734
00:53:26,909 --> 00:53:28,010
Why?

735
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:31,980
Why was it only Cho Sung Dong?

736
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:40,659
Wait a minute. Wait...

737
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,429
(Former judge accused of
receiving bribes murdered)

738
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:44,929
(There was a witness)

739
00:53:44,929 --> 00:53:46,960
(Reporter Cho Sung Dong)

740
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,159
These scoops.

741
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,500
He wasn't alone.

742
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,469
It's him.

743
00:55:35,500 --> 00:55:37,110
The second man at the scene.

744
00:55:38,869 --> 00:55:39,909
The cameraman.

745
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:42,280
Yes.

746
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:57,860
He worked with Cho Sung Dong
for two years as a cameraman.

747
00:55:58,059 --> 00:56:00,030
The time matches perfectly
with the serial murders.

748
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:01,760
He worked in
the special effects makeup team...

749
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:02,800
for four movies before that.

750
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,000
After quitting work,
he emigrated to China.

751
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,500
He returned two months ago.

752
00:56:06,769 --> 00:56:08,469
The villa he's staying in
right now...

753
00:56:08,469 --> 00:56:10,000
is a 20-minute walk away
from Yeom Hwa Ran's villa.

754
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:31,170
As of this moment, we will
carry out a search and seizure...

755
00:59:31,170 --> 00:59:32,869
on Jin Jae Gyu's residence.

756
00:59:33,139 --> 00:59:35,280
Three more people will die.

757
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:37,679
We have to dispatch everyone
to watch him.

758
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:39,550
Senior Superintendent Han, there's
been a personnel announcement.

759
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:41,949
Why did you do it?

760
00:59:41,949 --> 00:59:44,619
Are you close with
President Cho Sung Dong?

761
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:47,789
Everyone I touched. We need to
find who he will target among them.

762
00:59:47,789 --> 00:59:50,190
As soon as the moon begins
to shine,

763
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:52,860
they will meet a gruesome death.

764
00:59:53,489 --> 00:59:55,800
I found out Jin Jae Gyu's trick.
