(and incidents in this
drama are fictitious.)

5
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,030
The first thing I realized after
reading Jin Jae Gyu's memories...

6
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:00,829
is that out of the 57 years
of his life,

7
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:02,600
he was happy...

8
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,200
for merely a couple of years.

9
00:01:07,569 --> 00:01:09,340
To him, true happiness...

10
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:11,939
was experienced
only during his childhood.

11
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,829
Why do you have to kill goats?

12
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:35,700
In order to save a life.

13
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,370
Whose life are you trying to save
by killing it?

14
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,010
I'm sacrificing it
to save a human's life.

15
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,849
Is a human's life more precious
than an animal's?

16
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:52,049
I don't know much about it,

17
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,489
but these animals
have been virtuous...

18
00:01:56,189 --> 00:01:58,090
and will go to a nice place.

19
00:01:58,689 --> 00:01:59,760
Where?

20
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:01,390
Somewhere nice.

21
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,959
Let's go home...

22
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:07,099
and wish the goat well.

23
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:28,050
Don't come near the shrine,
or else, you'll bring in bad luck.

24
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,379
Let's go.

25
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,629
Here.

26
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,689
I'm going to save lives like you do.

27
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,960
Don't do that.

28
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,330
I've been praying
to the spirits constantly...

29
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,430
so that they wouldn't visit you.

30
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:50,370
Don't you know?

31
00:03:51,139 --> 00:03:53,099
I'm not going to become a shaman.

32
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:57,080
I'm going to become
a judge or a prosecutor.

33
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:05,120
Is that okay?

34
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,419
Of course.

35
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,540
However, her wish never came true.

36
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,980
Hwang Pil Sun.
You will die a horrible death.

37
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,350
- When she died,
- Mom!

38
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,420
- the spirits that possessed her...
- Mom!

39
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:42,689
went to him.

40
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:44,060
Is anyone in?

41
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,029
Anyone?

42
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,839
My goodness!

43
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,589
He prayed to the spirits
to save his mom,

44
00:05:17,019 --> 00:05:18,189
but it was of no use.

45
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,790
And that was the end
of his happiness.

46
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:29,399
(15 years later, 1986)

47
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,189
- What are you doing?
- He wants to speak with you.

48
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,459
What?

49
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:05,100
Come on! I told you
I don't want to get married!

50
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,470
His father is the chief justice,
and he's an elite prosecutor.

51
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,139
Isn't that nice?

52
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,009
What is going on?

53
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:30,959
My goodness!

54
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,629
- It's me.
- Who are you?

55
00:06:35,629 --> 00:06:36,730
Be quiet.

56
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:38,569
What do you want?

57
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:40,910
I guess you forgot about me.

58
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:44,079
I'm the son of the shaman
you poisoned to death.

59
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,480
That...

60
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:49,310
That wench?

61
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,449
Thanks to that hospital director
you bribed,

62
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:54,720
I rotted in a cell
for the past 15 years.

63
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:57,990
I was locked up since I was eight.

64
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,519
I'm sorry, ma'am.

65
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:02,160
He threatened me with a gun.

66
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:04,699
- I had no choice.
- Shut it!

67
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:09,930
- There must be a misunderstanding.
- The gunshot was loud.

68
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,509
It was much louder
than I had imagined.

69
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:22,279
It's a pity
there's only one bullet left.

70
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,699
I want to live.

71
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,939
I want to forget everything
and live an ordinary life.

72
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:51,040
Let me go...

73
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,079
or just kill me.

74
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,740
Pil Sun!

75
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,779
You...

76
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:30,980
What are you...

77
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,190
Father.

78
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,559
What did you say?

79
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,730
Father.

80
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,549
What have you done?

81
00:09:23,769 --> 00:09:24,940
I found out way too late...

82
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:28,840
why the Eraser was so bent...

83
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,309
on making Jin Jae Gyu side with him.

84
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,750
It was because
they had a common enemy.

85
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,950
She was the root of every evil deed.

86
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,320
Hwang Pil Sun.

87
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:09,909
You guys...

88
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,019
are in huge trouble.

89
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,320
Watch what you say.

90
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:20,190
Are you aware
that the Eraser is after you?

91
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,460
Don't show them all of your cards.

92
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:26,399
What do you mean?

93
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,870
What do you think?

94
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:30,669
This is all happening
thanks to someone...

95
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:32,870
who committed murder
after getting high.

96
00:10:34,509 --> 00:10:37,710
And his mother
fabricated a suicide note...

97
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,440
and made the rest of his family die.

98
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:42,950
- Don't be ridiculous.
- This is new.

99
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:45,450
You're going to feign ignorance?

100
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,490
My goodness.

101
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:54,029
What I mean is, you're the first one
to raise their voice at me.

102
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:57,830
You'll be experiencing
many new things in the future.

103
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,330
At the very least,
you'll be behind bars.

104
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:02,129
In the worst-case scenario,
the Eraser will kill you.

105
00:11:02,269 --> 00:11:04,169
- Shut it.
- Be quiet.

106
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,039
Let me make this clear.

107
00:11:08,909 --> 00:11:12,240
This murderer called the Eraser...

108
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,779
is ultimately after
him and me?

109
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,279
And that's why he abducted
my daughter-in-law?

110
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,080
You nailed it, lady.

111
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,889
She's a chairwoman.

112
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,120
Let's say you're right.

113
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,090
But why would he bring up something
from 20 years ago?

114
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,529
How would I know?
I'm not the psychopath.

115
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,529
He's getting rid
of those under you...

116
00:11:34,899 --> 00:11:36,970
so that you'll be trembling in fear.

117
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:39,240
Fear?

118
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,440
You know nothing about me, then.

119
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:45,580
He's harming
their innocent family members,

120
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,840
just like how he abducted Ms. Eun.

121
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:50,820
Don't be ridiculous.
It's all because of him.

122
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:54,049
It's true
that the Eraser and I are enemies.

123
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:56,289
We're dying to kill each other.

124
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,759
Would you like me to be honest?

125
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:02,330
Up until recently,
I couldn't understand...

126
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:04,500
why the Eraser did what he did.

127
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,399
But I'm starting to get it now.

128
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:08,769
I especially understand...

129
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,570
his hatred toward you.

130
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,940
I saw what you did to Jin Jae Gyu.

131
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,309
Look. Explain it
so I can understand.

132
00:12:23,309 --> 00:12:24,779
Do you want me to be
even more honest?

133
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,620
I don't care about your fates.

134
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,389
I only want to save...

135
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,559
the innocent Ms. Eun.

136
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,690
I don't expect you to feel sorry,

137
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:38,159
but come clean if you want
to save her and her baby.

138
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,860
Come clean about what happened...

139
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,629
to Moon Yong Dae 20 years ago.

140
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,169
I'm only interested in protecting...

141
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,139
my family and my son's honor.

142
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:55,110
His honor?

143
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:57,519
Is that more important
than your daughter-in-law's life?

144
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:03,850
Those who don't have
any honor to protect...

145
00:13:04,419 --> 00:13:05,820
won't understand me.

146
00:13:07,889 --> 00:13:10,330
If anyone taints...

147
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,899
my son's reputation,

148
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:17,500
you will pay for it
no matter who you are.

149
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:21,669
You obviously don't know who I am.

150
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,850
Hand them over to the prosecution.

151
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,919
What is this?

152
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,649
You assaulted me first,
and now, you're leaving? Seriously?

153
00:13:44,929 --> 00:13:48,700
(Episode 14: Two Layers of Evil)

154
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,970
Darn it.

155
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,720
Move! I said, move!

156
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,259
Please pity this poor soul
and save him.

157
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:19,529
Lord, we beg you.

158
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:22,500
Please...

159
00:14:41,490 --> 00:14:44,460
We lost Dong Baek, sir.

160
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,159
Get him.

161
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,259
Bring all the men
from the Intelligence Agency.

162
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:53,059
Yes, sir.

163
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:05,080
- Where is he?
- He's one floor below, sir.

164
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,840
Lead the way.

165
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,500
Tell me who the Eraser is,

166
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:29,799
and I'll spare you.

167
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,409
I already died 20 years ago.

168
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:40,980
It was the moment
I saw my brother's body...

169
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:44,279
in the morgue.

170
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,190
Oh, no...

171
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,330
Yong Dae... No...

172
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:55,759
No...

173
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,269
No... No...

174
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:03,500
This can't be...

175
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,039
In his suicide note,

176
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,899
he wrote that he couldn't bear
with the poverty.

177
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,639
No, Yong Dae...

178
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:12,409
Because of those words,
even my mom took her own life.

179
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,279
Honey!

180
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:17,980
- Stay with me!
- My dad couldn't bear it...

181
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,220
and left home.

182
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,090
His body...

183
00:16:21,990 --> 00:16:23,950
is probably underwater
somewhere in the mountains.

184
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:26,960
And no one has probably found him.

185
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,159
I knew...

186
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,860
that the suicide note
was fabricated.

187
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,500
If he had truly felt that way,

188
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:42,370
he would've mentioned it in advance.

189
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:47,279
Bang Jun Seok
only killed my brother.

190
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:50,149
But you killed the rest of us.

191
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:52,519
But what? You'll spare me?

192
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,879
How?

193
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,620
How's that possible when you already
killed me back then?

194
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:03,590
Despite knowing everything,

195
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,259
you still spared Bang Jun Seok?

196
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:09,529
He doesn't deserve to die
that easily.

197
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,299
The same goes for your son.

198
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,410
- What?
- Do you think it was luck...

199
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,849
that he survived?

200
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,309
His pain...

201
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,119
has just started.

202
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:37,029
Who is the Eraser?

203
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:40,759
I don't know.

204
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:44,230
My memory has been erased.

205
00:17:55,009 --> 00:17:56,079
Fine.

206
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,720
I guess you'll have to die, then.

207
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:03,150
What are you going to do?

208
00:18:05,019 --> 00:18:06,460
Kill me yourself?

209
00:18:41,089 --> 00:18:43,730
I'd like to see him
for just a short while.

210
00:18:44,329 --> 00:18:45,630
I said, no.

211
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:47,630
This isn't fair.

212
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,470
I should be able to see him.

213
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:51,269
I thought you two didn't have
anything going on.

214
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,349
Where is the Eraser?

215
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:13,759
Did you enjoy...

216
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:18,029
watching your son burn to death?

217
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:21,769
- What did you say?
- You know,

218
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,539
my brother...

219
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,369
was also burned
and pushed off a cliff.

220
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:30,569
But the Eraser said
he's going to do it the other way.

221
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,410
He'll make you fall first...

222
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,750
and then slowly burn you to death.

223
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:41,079
He said it'd be too boring
if you died too soon.

224
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:44,289
Die.

225
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:50,130
I wasn't going to tell you this,

226
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,960
but he's a murder suspect.

227
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,630
You should come here
with your lawyer.

228
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,930
If not, you can't visit him.

229
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,369
Why are you all out here?
Where's Moon Yong Gwang?

230
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:05,380
The Intelligence Agency took over.

231
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,380
- What?
- They have no right to do that.

232
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:11,950
Chief Byun.

233
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:17,849
It's been a while.

234
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:20,289
Why is the chief of
the Intelligence Agency doing here?

235
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:23,789
- Shall we have a chat?
- Let's talk another time.

236
00:20:24,329 --> 00:20:25,359
Secure the room.

237
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,500
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

238
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,369
This is the deputy chief's order.

239
00:20:30,329 --> 00:20:32,700
The deputy chief
and the director are upstairs.

240
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,069
We'll pull out soon,
so please wait.

241
00:20:35,269 --> 00:20:36,309
They're interrogating.

242
00:20:36,470 --> 00:20:37,710
Who's interrogating?

243
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:41,950
Section Chief Cheon Ki Soo
from the headquarters.

244
00:20:42,109 --> 00:20:43,309
Just act like you don't know.

245
00:20:44,619 --> 00:20:47,279
How could you let a family member
of a victim meet the suspect?

246
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:51,119
You're one of Deputy Chief Lee's
men, aren't you?

247
00:20:54,789 --> 00:20:55,859
I'm not.

248
00:20:55,859 --> 00:20:57,430
All we have to do
is follow the orders.

249
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:58,829
Secure the room!

250
00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:00,500
- Push through!
- Let's go!

251
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:01,930
Stop them.

252
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,130
- You can't go in.
- Push through.

253
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,670
Hey.

254
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,339
Who is the Eraser?

255
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:20,250
With time,
you'll only feel more pain...

256
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,349
from losing your son.

257
00:21:26,089 --> 00:21:27,589
Until your insides...

258
00:21:29,829 --> 00:21:31,859
get crushed into mush.

259
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:35,769
You don't even need
to go into trial.

260
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:38,500
You can just die in my hands.

261
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:52,980
Move it!

262
00:21:55,019 --> 00:21:56,589
- Watch it.
- Move.

263
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,920
- Hey, block him.
- Go.

264
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:00,059
Byun Young Soo!

265
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,059
(Moon Yong Gwang)

266
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:27,920
You can go in first.

267
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:30,920
It's cold.

268
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:42,069
I was a marine, you know.

269
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,769
We're known to catch ghosts.

270
00:22:43,769 --> 00:22:46,700
I can even eat raw snakes.

271
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:47,900
All of a sudden?

272
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,970
But can you make sure
to look out for mice?

273
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:54,039
I hate mice with long tails
the most.

274
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,750
What about mice
with their tails cut off?

275
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:00,220
What about Mickey Mouse?

276
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,450
How about Jerry from
"Tom and Jerry"?

277
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,789
I hate all kinds of mice.

278
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:11,190
Over there. Did you hear it?
Did you hear it?

279
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,829
He might be a big guy,
but he's only a kid.

280
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:22,710
What's the matter?

281
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:24,440
He saw a mouse.

282
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:27,180
I really hate mice.

283
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,509
- Did anyone tail you?
- We avoided security cameras.

284
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:32,279
No one would imagine
we'd use the murderer's route.

285
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,250
- What about your phones?
- It's turned off.

286
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,950
- Did you call your youngest?
- I'm not an amateur.

287
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,599
Hwang Pil Sun is the final villain.

288
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,200
She manipulated Moon Yong Dae's
murder and made his family die too.

289
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:57,440
Bang Jun Seok was the leader
of the eight.

290
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,549
He's also the main culprit
who killed Moon Yong Dae.

291
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,019
Why wasn't he
at the abandoned warehouse, then?

292
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:07,019
Hwang Pil Sun forced him to go
on an escape trip.

293
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,289
He's garbage. But he's dreaming
of becoming the president.

294
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:12,359
Hwang instigated
Deputy Chief Lee Shin Woong...

295
00:24:12,359 --> 00:24:14,490
- to cover up everything.
- I'm 100 percent sure.

296
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:18,660
I could read that from his face.
He looks wicked.

297
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:23,029
But you said that he became
successful thanks to his face.

298
00:24:23,029 --> 00:24:25,769
I only said that because he has
the face to succeed.

299
00:24:25,869 --> 00:24:27,539
In terms of his personality,
he looks nasty.

300
00:24:27,839 --> 00:24:29,640
Master face reader,

301
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:32,180
- do I have the face of a king?
- Be quiet.

302
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,440
We have a conclusion. What now?

303
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:36,049
There's something
that hasn't been resolved.

304
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,549
First, why did Eraser wait 20 years?

305
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:40,849
You're right.

306
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:43,549
Hwang and her son deserve to die.

307
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:45,289
They weren't even touched.

308
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,190
Maybe the Eraser was in prison.

309
00:24:48,089 --> 00:24:49,529
- Sharp observation.
- Right?

310
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:51,359
Should I check the list
of released prisoners?

311
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,529
Secondly, let's say the Eraser
had a reason.

312
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:56,170
Why did Jin Jae Gyu
let Hwang stay alive?

313
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,569
She's an enemy who killed his mom.
Why didn't he kill her earlier?

314
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:03,769
You're right. It makes sense
for the Executioner to kill her.

315
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,880
She's a piece of garbage
who didn't pay her price.

316
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,250
Was it erased from his memory?

317
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,049
Or did he let her off the hook
for being his half-sister?

318
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:13,980
No. He had a flash of precognition.

319
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:15,849
- "Precognition"?
- He saw the future.

320
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:17,119
Hwang Pil Sun.

321
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,690
As a child, Jin Jae Gyu
predicted Hwang Pil Sun's death.

322
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,490
You will die a horrible death.

323
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:28,329
He received a revelation while
he was at the mental institute.

324
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,039
Killing her earlier would be
like a blessing.

325
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:40,140
He believed Hwang Pil Sun
will face a terrible end.

326
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:47,619

00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,359
What are you doing? Did you
get any scoops on Dong Baek?

328
00:25:57,859 --> 00:26:00,000
"Detective Superpower's
Lonely Fight"?

329
00:26:01,529 --> 00:26:02,599
Are you crazy?

330
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:06,569
"Detective Superpower's
Lonely Fight"?

331
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:10,569
Are you trying to kill me?

332
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:12,509
I only wrote what I found out
from my research.

333
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,849
I shouldn't be writing with
a conclusion someone ordered.

334
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,420
- How can that be news?
- Hey, Kang...

335
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,579
It's an unwritten law for a reporter
to follow the tone of the press.

336
00:26:21,849 --> 00:26:23,890
If you're not happy with it,
you should start your own broadcast.

337
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,119
Don't you know?

338
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:29,759
Even children criticize us
when our broadcast vans pass.

339
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,400
No press is siding with Dong Baek.

340
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,970
If you want to keep this up,
you should resign.

341
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:39,200
Why should I?

342
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:41,200
Yet you still want to get paid?

343
00:26:44,809 --> 00:26:47,039
I will file a lawsuit
for unfair dismissal.

344
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,750
"Lawsuit"? Are you crazy?

345
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:51,180
All right, go ahead.

346
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,279
Ji Eun!

347
00:26:55,650 --> 00:26:58,089
- Did the picture come?
- What picture?

348
00:26:58,089 --> 00:26:59,420
I said, did the picture come?

349
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,519
Reporter Kang.

350
00:27:02,759 --> 00:27:04,460
Out of my way.

351
00:27:08,470 --> 00:27:10,970
Wait, sir. Let's record it first.

352
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:15,140
(Attn: Reporter Kang Ji Eun)

353
00:27:17,509 --> 00:27:19,480
Someone called
with their voice disguised.

354
00:27:20,009 --> 00:27:21,180
They said
they'll give us an exclusive.

355
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,009
Was it the Eraser?

356
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:24,650
Their condition...

357
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,650
is to have our youngest reporter
write about it exclusively.

358
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:03,890
Kang Ji Eun! Are you trying to waste
a winning lottery ticket?

359
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:07,289
The moment we write about this,
we'll become Eraser's fools.

360
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,329
We'd be forcing Det. Dong
into a corner.

361
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:10,829
All the more reasons
to publish the news.

362
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,200
(A nail each day
until Dong Baek dies)

363
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,039
Sir.

364
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:29,450
I won't write about it.

365
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,779
Third.
This is the most important question.

366
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,319
What kind of grudge
does Eraser have?

367
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,490
We were able to confirm
Moon Yong Gwang's grudge.

368
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,990
Bang Jun Seok
killed his big brother,

369
00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:47,500
and Hwang Pil Sun made his parents
die with a fake suicide note.

370
00:28:47,859 --> 00:28:50,869
But in the end, his revenge...

371
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,299
The Eraser did it in his place.

372
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:57,509
The problem is, we still don't know
the Eraser's motive.

373
00:28:58,410 --> 00:29:00,109
Are you sure Moon Yong Gwang
isn't the Eraser?

374
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:01,539
He's not.

375
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,150
The Eraser showed up after he sent
Moon Yong Gwang as bait.

376
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:10,450
In conclusion, if we can
figure out the Eraser's motive...

377
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,119
We will naturally find out
his identity.

378
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:14,990
Wouldn't it be someone
late Moon Yong Dae knew?

379
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:16,359
Perhaps a friend?

380
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:19,099
The situation team is researching
in secret, but they have no leads.

381
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,200
Why don't we dig about
Baek's background?

382
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,700
The Eraser killed Baek's mother
in Shimbae City.

383
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,500
(Eraser)

384
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,539
We won't be able to find traces
of his childhood in Shimbae City.

385
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,940
For over seven years,
not a single person said...

386
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,079
they knew Detective Superpower.

387
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,009
Then where on earth
did he come from?

388
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,549
Maybe North Korea?

389
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,849
Sharp observation.

390
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:43,920
- He could be a secret weapon.
- Yes.

391
00:29:44,089 --> 00:29:45,490
Only one clue is left.

392
00:29:45,819 --> 00:29:47,289
What was the first question again?

393
00:29:47,289 --> 00:29:49,460
Why did the Eraser wait 20 years?

394
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,200
The clue is the reason why he
waited 20 years to take his revenge.

395
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,029
Do you mean it wasn't
to avenge Moon Yong Dae?

396
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,000
I'm certain there's something bigger
than that.

397
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:59,569
He's being so patient
while putting in so much effort.

398
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,140
It can't be a simple act of revenge.

399
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,109
- Then how...
- The Eraser...

400
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:10,309
has a strong grudge against
Hwang Pil Sun's family.

401
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,450
We'll dig about the grudge
between the two of them.

402
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,920
Why didn't you say so earlier?

403
00:30:14,019 --> 00:30:15,990
I would've read her mind.

404
00:30:16,349 --> 00:30:17,490
You can't scan her memories.

405
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:20,160
We don't have any other choice.
Do you have a better idea?

406
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,160
Whatever it is, it's better
than cleaning up after a corpse.

407
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,460
Is someone going to die?

408
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:27,130
They say he'll die
if he keeps on scanning.

409
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:29,569
I'm telling you,
Professor Ahn is overacting.

410
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:31,970
- Call the medical team.
- Okay.

411
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:34,440
Hey, don't do it.
They could wiretap us.

412
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,339
If you die, I'll get fired too.

413
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:38,710
You're fated to get fired anyway.
Just forget about it.

414
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:41,609
Hey! Do you think I'm doing this
because I'm worried about my job?

415
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,779
Don't you care about the people
who are worried about you?

416
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:45,750
Just because you're cold
doesn't mean everybody is.

417
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:48,420
How much longer will you
live so selfishly?

418
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:50,119
Baek.

419
00:30:51,019 --> 00:30:52,359
There's breaking news.

420
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:55,630
On Eun Soo Gyeong.

421
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:03,430
We received two new pictures
of Ms. Eun Soo Gyeong...

422
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:04,700
who was abducted.

423
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:07,640
We're careful to talk about it.

424
00:31:07,869 --> 00:31:10,869
The first picture
has a terrifying warning that says,

425
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:15,309
"A nail each day
until Dong Baek dies."

426
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,549
- Reporter Park.
- Yes?

427
00:31:16,549 --> 00:31:19,420
Do they mean Detective Superpower
when they say "Dong Baek"?

428
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:20,480
Yes, that's right.

429
00:31:20,619 --> 00:31:22,819
There is no other way to read it
other than as a warning...

430
00:31:22,819 --> 00:31:24,250
for Detective Dong Baek.

431
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:26,190
What is the second picture about?

432
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:30,829
The second picture is too cruel
for us to reveal it at the moment.

433
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,230
But since the people
deserve to know...

434
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:36,900
There is a blurred image behind us.

435
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,529
What is this a picture of?

436
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:41,500
We assume it's a picture
of Ms. Eun Soo Gyeong's feet.

437
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,490
They're your wife's feet.

438
00:31:59,259 --> 00:32:00,289
Are you sure?

439
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:05,190
My son was tortured the same way.

440
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:21,109
The focus naturally lands on
their grudge against Det. Dong.

441
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,180
Could it be because of a crime...

442
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,549
- Det. Dong committed?
- They're garbage.

443
00:32:24,549 --> 00:32:26,319
We can't make a hasty conclusion,

444
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,380
but we believe...

445
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:32,160
Det. Dong made an enemy
of the culprit.

446
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,059
In any case, you mean
Det. Dong's behavior...

447
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:38,529
is highly likely the cause.

448
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:41,059
That's right.
A reasonable assumption...

449
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:44,930
is that the series of terrorism
might be acts of revenge...

450
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:47,500
made by the Eraser
against Det. Dong's behavior.

451
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,569
Even after the initial warning,

452
00:32:49,569 --> 00:32:51,740
Det. Dong hasn't stated
his position yet.

453
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,680
Either Det. Dong provided...

454
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,609
the basis for these terrible acts
of terrorism,

455
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:59,349
or he must be at least abetting it.

456
00:32:59,349 --> 00:33:01,779
Such criticisms are on the rise.

457
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,549
Nice comment.

458
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:06,160
He's good. He knows how
to make it dramatic.

459
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,190
They could be the same person,

460
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,289
or they are accomplices
at the least.

461
00:33:11,690 --> 00:33:13,829
Det. Dong always voiced
his support for justice.

462
00:33:13,829 --> 00:33:17,670
But why is he so quiet
when it's something to do with him?

463
00:33:17,670 --> 00:33:20,500
Many people are disappointed...

464
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:22,710
as they find the situation strange.

465
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:26,509
They're criticizing him for changing
his attitude now that it's personal.

466
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,309
Our bulletin board is
currently filling up...

467
00:33:29,309 --> 00:33:30,680
with requests to condemn Det. Dong.

468
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,250
- Look at that face of his.
- We're also getting...

469
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:34,779
numerous requests to reveal
Eun Soo Gyeong's picture.

470
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:37,650
In this regard, you can catch
the second part of...

471
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:41,390
They'd do anything to get
higher viewership.

472
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:45,259
By the way, why does the Eraser
keep on provoking you?

473
00:33:45,259 --> 00:33:47,630
He's playing mind games
to make me nervous.

474
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,069
Are you okay?

475
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:52,940
Of course. I should do the opposite
by being laid-back.

476
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:57,240
Doesn't it feel like these two
changed roles?

477
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,579
Let's get some good sleep
and leave in the morning.

478
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,680
- To where?
- To Hwang Pil Sun.

479
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:05,109
Like Senior Superintendent Han said,
we just need to dig that old lady...

480
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:06,220
to find out the big picture.

481
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,650
The Eraser's grudge,
and his identity too.

482
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:25,539
What is this?

483
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,769
This is nothing to rebuke about.

484
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:34,110
You've gotten big.

485
00:34:36,349 --> 00:34:39,579
You did as well. All thanks to me.

486
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,889
(Chairwoman Hwang Pil Sun)

487
00:34:47,219 --> 00:34:49,889
How could you let it get to this
all because of that detective?

488
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,099
Strictly speaking,
it's not just because of Dong Baek.

489
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,070
The mistake you made 20 years ago...

490
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:01,769
is what called out a monster
named the Eraser.

491
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,750
You must be dizzy.

492
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:15,650
A dog from the lowest rank...

493
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:18,449
have climbed up to the top
of the pyramid.

494
00:35:22,429 --> 00:35:23,489
Assemblyman Bang.

495
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:28,500
I didn't save you from your trouble
out of loyalty.

496
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:30,570
I did it because
I believed it was right.

497
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,800
It was the best solution...

498
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,070
for everyone, including the victims.

499
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:41,010
Unfortunately, unexpected sacrifices
had to be made.

500
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,449
- So?
- I'm telling you...

501
00:35:43,449 --> 00:35:45,050
I didn't do it out of loyalty.

502
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:48,550
Just like how the chairwoman
decided to use me...

503
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:50,590
based on my competence.

504
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:52,619
Did you let things become like this
because you're competent?

505
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,630
You must think
you have the upper hand...

506
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,300
because you know my weakness.

507
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,530
Of course not.

508
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:05,599
It would be boring
to describe it this way,

509
00:36:06,239 --> 00:36:08,800
but we're sharing a common destiny.

510
00:36:12,409 --> 00:36:13,610
Firstly,

511
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:17,079
I don't care if my daughter-in-law
lives or dies.

512
00:36:18,849 --> 00:36:19,849
Mother!

513
00:36:25,389 --> 00:36:26,460
Secondly,

514
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,659
Assemblyman Bang...

515
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,460
must get out of this...

516
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:35,670
unscathed.

517
00:36:37,269 --> 00:36:39,000
You should turn this misfortune
into a blessing.

518
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:42,469
Sympathy votes are the biggest asset
a politician can have.

519
00:36:42,469 --> 00:36:44,039
What would you know?

520
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,409
Thirdly,

521
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:50,309
the criminal who knows the secret
cannot walk into court.

522
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:51,880
Never.

523
00:36:52,449 --> 00:36:53,750
I'll keep that in mind.

524
00:36:53,949 --> 00:36:55,150
Lastly,

525
00:36:56,219 --> 00:36:57,550
the scapegoat...

526
00:36:58,349 --> 00:37:00,090
will have to be buried as well.

527
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,630
Are you talking about Dong Baek?

528
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,230
Anyone who can become
a threat to my son...

529
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,400
should all disappear.

530
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,670
My wife can't get hurt.

531
00:37:17,909 --> 00:37:21,139
If anything goes wrong, you'll die.

532
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,420
I'll do my best.

533
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,619
Let me repeat myself.

534
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,860
I don't care
if she makes it out alive.

535
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,960
Actually, I want the opposite.

536
00:37:43,369 --> 00:37:44,429
Keep that in mind.

537
00:37:46,369 --> 00:37:48,139
I have a different stance from you,

538
00:37:49,369 --> 00:37:50,610
but we have the same goal.

539
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:55,679
Getting rid of the Eraser
and Dong Baek at once...

540
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:58,250
is the only way...

541
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,480
to protect our children.

542
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,599
Meadow!

543
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:52,739
Why did you eat it all?

544
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,099
What?

545
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:57,739
You shouldn't...

546
00:39:42,619 --> 00:39:43,849
Are you going out for a walk
at this hour?

547
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,860
Did you stay up all night
so you could watch me?

548
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:52,500
- I sleep lightly.
- Just act like you didn't see me.

549
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,030
Those who are pressured by guilt...

550
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:57,130
often throw themselves
into danger and death.

551
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:00,599
- No one's dying.
- It's not Meadow.

552
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:04,110
The child in Eun Soo Gyeong
isn't Seol Meadow.

553
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,739
- This isn't about that.
- Yes, it is.

554
00:40:06,110 --> 00:40:07,980
You haven't rid yourself
of the guilt from seven years ago.

555
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,380
I'm just trying to stop him from
making her suffer because of me.

556
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,010
How is that because of you?

557
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:13,480
He's playing mind games.

558
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,519
- I'll be back.
- You could really die.

559
00:40:15,519 --> 00:40:16,519
It doesn't matter.

560
00:40:16,519 --> 00:40:18,320
What I hate more is someone else
getting hurt because of me.

561
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,489
What... What? What is this?

562
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,190
What's going on?

563
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,059
Baek, seriously.

564
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,800
For goodness' sake, I knew it.

565
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:32,869
I told you. It was a good idea
to install an alarm.

566
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:35,170
Handcuff him so
he won't go anywhere.

567
00:40:35,269 --> 00:40:36,510
You've all done enough.

568
00:40:37,469 --> 00:40:39,070
- It's my fight now.
- Cut the nonsense.

569
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:42,110
Who do you think you are,
a superhuman or something?

570
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:43,550
Stay out of this, Old Man.

571
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:44,750
You have to see your kid
getting married.

572
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:46,150
Shut your mouth.

573
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:48,380
Wherever it may be,
we'll always be with you.

574
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,619
As long as you don't stress me out
and listen to me,

575
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:52,519
I'll be able to live until I'm 100.

576
00:40:53,889 --> 00:40:55,360
Se Hoon, you should
stay out of this too.

577
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:56,690
You're making me upset.

578
00:40:57,159 --> 00:40:59,260
Robin should always
be beside Batman.

579
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,730
What about me then?

580
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:03,269
Alfred?

581
00:41:03,269 --> 00:41:04,929
Alfred? Isn't that their dog's name?

582
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,300
He's the butler that manages
the house.

583
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:08,570
You're perfect for the role.

584
00:41:12,469 --> 00:41:13,539
We're on the same team.

585
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,880
Let's just follow Dong Baek around.
I'll be the director.

586
00:41:17,949 --> 00:41:19,550
Senior Superintendent Han
is the one in charge.

587
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:21,750
She's our captain.

588
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:24,650
Captain, aren't you hungry?
You're wide awake, right?

589
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,420
It's still in
the middle of the night.

590
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:29,230
Why are you wandering about
in the morning? My goodness.

591
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:32,190
You really know how to annoy me.
I just want to smack you sometimes.

592
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,059
How about some ramyeon?

593
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,800
Captain, do you eat ramyeon?

594
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,570
- Sounds good.
- Okay.

595
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,900
Who's buying?
Rock-paper-scissors.

596
00:41:39,099 --> 00:41:40,699
- I won. You go.
- Go get ramyeon.

597
00:41:57,789 --> 00:42:00,519
Joon! My son.

598
00:42:03,929 --> 00:42:05,690
- Dad.
- Yes, it's me.

599
00:42:06,699 --> 00:42:09,130
- Can you recognize me?
- Yes.

600
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,369
He has passed the critical stage.

601
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,940
Let's focus on his recovery now.

602
00:42:14,269 --> 00:42:15,500
Thank you.

603
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,909
Thank you, sir.

604
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:19,809
Honey.

605
00:42:21,409 --> 00:42:22,510
Thank you.

606
00:42:22,909 --> 00:42:24,010
My son.

607
00:43:04,519 --> 00:43:06,019
How is your son?

608
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,090
He has passed the critical stage.

609
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:15,199
He's in a critical condition.

610
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:19,940
Where did it all start going wrong?

611
00:43:21,969 --> 00:43:23,139
Do you blame me?

612
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,409
You were my savior...

613
00:43:28,809 --> 00:43:29,949
until a few days ago.

614
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:35,750
I was about to be fired,
but you made me into a chief.

615
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:39,360
- And now?
- It's meaningless.

616
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,789
Since my son died.

617
00:43:48,659 --> 00:43:49,800
Get some rest.

618
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:52,369
I'll make sure you get your revenge.

619
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:55,570
Who is the Eraser?

620
00:43:58,639 --> 00:44:00,539
- It's not your business.
- It is!

621
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:03,250
Consider it the price of
my son's life.

622
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:14,590
Dong Baek.

623
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,530
Are you sure?

624
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:29,340
He's an accomplice
at the very least.

625
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:32,409
This is a video
taken at the safe house.

626
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,179
In that backpack...

627
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:37,909
is the weapon he used
to do that to my son.

628
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:58,329
He's after Chairwoman Hwang.

629
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:39,480
That's RIU's undercover vehicle.

630
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:50,550
The Intelligence Agency
is staking out too.

631
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:54,289
- What do we do?
- What do you think? Let's just go.

632
00:45:54,489 --> 00:45:55,519
No.

633
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,230
No? How are we going to
get past them?

634
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,239
(Viewer Ratings)

635
00:46:10,909 --> 00:46:13,309
Goodness, look at these ratings.

636
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:19,409
But what if the Eraser tips-off
another media outlet next time?

637
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:20,519
It can't be helped.

638
00:46:20,780 --> 00:46:23,219
It's better than wasting time
and blowing a scoop.

639
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:27,360
Make sure to take care of
Kang Ji Eun.

640
00:46:28,389 --> 00:46:29,460
Yes, sir.

641
00:46:30,889 --> 00:46:31,989
Yes, sir.

642
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:41,800
Hey, what are you doing?

643
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:43,309
Hey, wait!

644
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:48,909
From now on, you can wait in here.

645
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,130
What about my laptop?

646
00:47:05,130 --> 00:47:07,099
We have the right to confiscate
all company property.

647
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:08,829
When you need to go somewhere,

648
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:10,699
receive prior permission
from the Administrative Team.

649
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:12,300
Even when you have to use
the restroom.

650
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,070
If you don't, you'll receive
additional disciplinary action.

652
00:47:33,789 --> 00:47:34,860
Yes?

653
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,260
What?

654
00:47:40,059 --> 00:47:42,159
Former assemblyman Bang Jun Seok...

655
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,269
will make
a public announcement shortly.

656
00:47:44,429 --> 00:47:47,969
We expect him to send a message
to the perp who abducted his wife.

657
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:51,969
While he embraced the socially weak
with his strong leadership,

658
00:47:52,239 --> 00:47:56,380
he was a man of conviction
who fought against justice.

659
00:47:56,510 --> 00:48:00,019
There are also opinions he will
respond according to his principles.

660
00:48:12,929 --> 00:48:14,130
Did you memorize the script?

661
00:48:16,329 --> 00:48:18,670
Everything will go well
if I follow that script?

662
00:48:19,469 --> 00:48:22,000
No, Soo Gyeong won't come back.

663
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:24,139
Mom.

664
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:28,010
Do you think her abductors
wouldn't have told her anything?

665
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,750
But still, how could we
abandon Soo Gyeong?

666
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:32,809
No. It's Soo Gyeong
who will abandon you.

667
00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:37,489
If she returns safely,
will she still be on your side?

668
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:38,989
With her personality?

669
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,389
Determining who is on your side
is simple.

670
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:46,800
Someone who never thinks
of betraying you...

671
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,929
even when they know
every dirty little secret about you.

672
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:55,900
It's rather someone like her who
maybe on your side until the end.

673
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:01,280
But, still.

674
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:14,460
I guess you're not.

675
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:22,699
You're someone who will betray him.

676
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,230
- No, ma'am...
- Mr. Cho.

677
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,610
This is what you call
someone on your side.

678
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:41,449
Someone who can kill without
hesitation upon your order.

679
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:54,900
I don't like her eyes.

680
00:49:59,739 --> 00:50:01,300
Still, how can I abandon Soo Gyeong?

681
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,869
I said she will abandon you!

682
00:50:02,869 --> 00:50:04,539
Still, I should persuade her.

683
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:06,880
She's even pregnant with my child.

684
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:08,340
Son.

685
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:10,909
Don't be afraid of losing things.

686
00:50:10,949 --> 00:50:14,519
What you should be afraid of
is not being able to have more.

687
00:50:15,719 --> 00:50:17,849
You will lose more things
from now on.

688
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:20,719
You'll have no choice but to
share your power...

689
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:22,420
to people all around you.

690
00:50:23,630 --> 00:50:26,630
But keep this in mind.

691
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:29,599
When you lose something,

692
00:50:29,659 --> 00:50:32,929
think about how much more
you'll be able to gain.

693
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,469
If Soo Gyeong dies,

694
00:50:37,710 --> 00:50:40,539
it will become a successful
investment that gifts you...

695
00:50:40,539 --> 00:50:42,079
with the biggest winning ever.

696
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:46,820
Do you understand?

697
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:54,820
- Let's go.
- Which way is it?

698
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,889
- We need to hurry.
- Come on.

699
00:50:57,030 --> 00:50:58,489
- Hurry.
- This way.

700
00:50:58,690 --> 00:50:59,900
Come on.

701
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,530
- Over there!
- What's going on?

702
00:51:21,750 --> 00:51:23,550
Dong Baek is headed up
towards our trap.

- Professor Han.

705
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,590
The Eraser will go after
Chairwoman Hwang.

706
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:04,030
- We'll capture him alive.
- Kill him.

707
00:52:04,190 --> 00:52:06,800
If Dong Baek is the Eraser,
we shouldn't kill him.

708
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:08,329
How will you handle the backlash?

709
00:52:08,329 --> 00:52:09,659
The higher-ups
will take responsibility.

710
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:11,500
There's no proof he is the Eraser.

711
00:52:11,530 --> 00:52:13,340
The one who goes after
Chairwoman Hwang is the Eraser.

712
00:52:13,699 --> 00:52:14,699
Do you have proof?

713
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:16,570
My words are the proof!

714
00:52:22,909 --> 00:52:24,949
You placed that truck
where it stands out, didn't you?

715
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:27,519
You knew Det. Dong was innocent,
and you were warning him.

To the people of our nation,

718

please...

719
00:52:54,409 --> 00:52:56,510
forgive me for standing
in this position today...

720

because of my personal issue.

721

For the last 12 years
as an assemblyman,

722
00:53:06,989 --> 00:53:09,860
I have never bent my principles
for my personal profit.

723

Not once.

724
00:53:12,829 --> 00:53:16,230
However, I have no choice but to...

725
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,940
cast aside my principles today.

726
00:53:23,670 --> 00:53:25,510
I'd like to plead to the person
who abducted my wife.

727
00:53:26,539 --> 00:53:29,679
Please do not hurt...

Whatever grudge you have
against Det. Dong,

730

I am willing to...

suffer in his place.

732
00:53:59,139 --> 00:54:00,179
Give him a chance.

A chance for Det. Dong
to find the smoking gun.

734
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,010
I already gave the order.

00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,469
Beats me.

739
00:54:35,210 --> 00:54:37,949
I plead once again to the person
who has my wife.

740
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:40,679
Whether I step down from my position
or donate all my money,

741
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:42,079
I'll do anything you want.

742

If you want to kill someone,
I will die 100, no 1,000 times...

- Yes, ma'am.

all of my memories.

806
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:55,480
I want to testify.

807
01:01:55,579 --> 01:01:58,349
The most important thing
for a reporter is the truth.

808
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:00,760
Will I really be able to change?
