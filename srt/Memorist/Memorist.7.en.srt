Special effects makeup? He made
the witnesses see him intentionally.

Wait.

Why was it Cho Sung Dong?

9

These scoops.

00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:14,510
The second man at the scene.
The cameraman.

12

The villa he's staying in
right now...

is a 20-minute walk away
from Yeom Hwa Ran's villa.

What brought police officers here...

15
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,780
at a time like this?

16
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:27,819
"Police officers"?

17
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:31,520
How did you know...

00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,590
we were from the police?

19
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:37,960
You're with Detective Superpower.

20
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,069
What brought a famous person
like you here?

21
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,000
You don't seem surprised at all...

22
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,439
as if you knew this would happen.

23
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,110
Should I be surprised?

24
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,680
Petty offenders pee their pants
the moment they see me.

25
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:54,050
But, some offenders can be bold.

26
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,409
It depends on how evil they are.

27
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,919
I knew you'd come.

28
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,620
How?

Freeze.

30
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,060
I'm working on the garden.

31
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,259
I had been away for a while.

32
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,300
How did you know we'd be here?

33
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,199
I dreamt...

34
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:51,469
of meeting you a long time ago.

35
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,169
I knew you were talented,

36
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:55,840
but precognitive dreams? Really?

37
00:03:59,009 --> 00:04:01,180
You seem to know
quite a lot about me.

38
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:02,780
I had a precognitive dream as well.

39
00:04:03,449 --> 00:04:06,379
I dreamt of meeting
a former photographer...

40
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,789
who kills while wearing a mask.

41
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,389
"Kills"?

42
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,520
Mr. Jin Jae Gyu.

43
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,430
There's the easy way
and the hard way...

44
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:16,829
to solve this.

45
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,300
- What's the easy way?
- Memory scan.

46
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,439
- Why?
- Do you not know?

47
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,839
I thought you knew we'd be coming.

48
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,670
I'm not that talented just yet.

49
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,410
"Talented"?

50
00:04:31,779 --> 00:04:33,209
We're investigating
a serial killing.

51
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:35,850
And a lot of the evidence...

52
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:38,180
points toward you.

53
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,319
For example?

54
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:44,819
The serial killings from two decades
ago are happening again.

55
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:48,829
And it so happened to start
around the time you came back.

56
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,699
What a coincidence.

57
00:04:55,329 --> 00:04:58,240
If you agree to be scanned,
your name can be cleared.

58
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,889
No.

59
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:24,800
Right.

60
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,930
You must feel guilty.

61
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:28,670
No, it just doesn't feel right.

62
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,500
So you choose the hard way?

63
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,970
If I must.

of your residence right now.

67

Come.

68
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,680
According to the law,

69

you have the right
to observe our actions.

70
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:25,089
- Go search.
- Yes, sir.

(Episode 7: Memory Eraser)

72
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,560
Why is it so dark?

73
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:38,300
He's been away for 20 years.

74
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,399
Let me see.

75
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:56,649
- There's nothing.
- I know.

76
00:07:57,379 --> 00:07:58,480
There's no TV either.

77
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,649
Did you believe
you were being righteous...

78
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,519
by committing murder?

79
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,360
Is this an official interrogation?

80
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:08,160
Let's say
it's just a personal question.

81
00:08:10,899 --> 00:08:12,560
"Personal"?

82
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,230
That's a surprise.

83

You seem to rely a lot on Det. Dong.

Aren't you the type
that doesn't believe in superpowers?

85

The murderer seems to know me
pretty well.

86
00:08:30,579 --> 00:08:32,549
And so do you.

87
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,690
All that I did
was to look into your soul.

88
00:08:42,029 --> 00:08:43,830
- You looked into my soul?
- I'm sorry.

89
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,029
I apologize if I offended you.

90
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:50,570
I wonder how long
your lame explanations will last.

91

We searched every nook and cranny
but couldn't find anything.

92
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,620
The murderer's not the type
to throw away his murder weapon.

93
00:09:13,889 --> 00:09:16,059
I'm sure he kept it like a trophy.

94
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,100
Let me.

95
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:05,879
Forget it. It's just a sewer.

96
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:08,779
Darn it.

97
00:10:27,629 --> 00:10:31,269
Gosh, I couldn't even have
a bowl of warm rice soup.

98
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:35,570
- But you had five sandwiches.
- Those were merely snacks.

99
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:40,509
Do you think he got rid of evidence
in advance?

100
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,519
- Are you saying she was wrong?
- We couldn't find anything.

101
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:48,190
How could that intelligent woman
make such a mistake?

102
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,620
Hello, ma'am.
Thank you for your hard work.

103
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,600
Once it's sundown,
the search and seizure will be over.

104
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,399
Even an old man like me
couldn't have a proper meal.

105
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,730
And there he is, stuffing his face.

106
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,470
Let him be. I like that
he's not causing any trouble.

107
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,110
He's just so inconsiderate.

108
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:23,549
Hey, hey.
It seems like he's up to something.

109
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,759
The chimney is quite big
when there isn't even a furnace.

110
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,600
That's for a fireplace.

111
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,340
Am I the only one
who finds that strange?

112
00:11:40,570 --> 00:11:41,970
He didn't even have a fireplace.

113
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,539
The second floor.

114
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,149
Fireplaces should be
on the first floor...

115
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:57,620
since the heat rises.

116
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:04,730
He never used it.

117
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,480
The killings will continue.

118
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,379
What?

119
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,970

Ma'am, they found a secret room.

126
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,470
What is this?

You have the right to remain silent
and the chance to defend yourself.

and put up a fight,

(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

137
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,299
I heard he's talking now.

- Yes. After a day.
- What is he saying?

He wants to see Det. Dong.

in front of the altar?

- Let me deal with him.
- No.

He's willing to spill everything
in front of me.

will come out soon.

You should let him talk to him.

If you get all worked up
and grab him by his collar,

146

you'll only cause a scene.

How did you know
about the Executioner?

167
00:17:32,019 --> 00:17:33,819
Don't you feel like...

168
00:17:34,529 --> 00:17:37,960
the truth is out there,
but no one can see it?

169
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,500
At times, you're proud of it.
Other times, it makes you lonely.

170
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,970
It's a strange and lonely feeling.

171
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,869
Can you scan memories as well?

172
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:50,339
No, sir.

173
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:52,480
I don't have a superpower
like you do.

174
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,240
Then are you a shaman?

175
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:58,220
I'm just someone who can see
a bit of the truth.

176
00:18:00,519 --> 00:18:04,250
I could hear the deity's voice
through much prayer and penance.

177
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,220
Are you really a shaman?

178
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,859
Such labels aren't important.

179
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:12,529
Fortunetellers, prophets...
They don't matter.

180
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:15,400
What's important is
the deity's words.

181
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:18,700
What a bunch of garbage.

182
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,309
"Garbage"?

183
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,309
I thought at least you...

184
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,480
would understand me.

185
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,009
I thought
you could hear revelations.

186
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:32,450
I guess your deity didn't tell you
that you'd be looked down upon.

187
00:18:34,319 --> 00:18:35,819
Aren't you just curious...

188
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,720
about the woman from 20 years ago
who died by the claw hammer?

189
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:44,799
Weren't all the victims male?

190
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:47,099
Yes, sir. They were.

191
00:18:57,009 --> 00:18:58,140
Aren't you curious...

192
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:02,980
about that beautiful woman...

193
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,220
who was dying?

194
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,490
She was your mom, wasn't she?

195
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:19,500
His mom?

196
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:24,430
It was you.

197
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:28,869
You killed her.

198
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,420
It's all your fault.

199
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,960
She died because of you.

200
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,059
Cut that nonsense.

201
00:19:47,059 --> 00:19:48,759
You brought danger upon her.

202
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:51,190
Don't let him get to you.

203
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:53,759
- Why did you kill her?
- The deity's fury...

204
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:54,869
You're the one who killed her.

205
00:19:54,869 --> 00:19:57,130
- The killings will continue.
- Bring him out of there.

206
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,839
Was that woman really my mom?

207
00:19:59,839 --> 00:20:01,440
They'll die one by one.

208
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,940
Answer me, you scumbag!

209
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,279
Three more people will die
before the dark moon rises!

210
00:20:05,279 --> 00:20:06,410
Tell me right now!

211
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:09,079
You've cursed them,
and they will die gruesome deaths!

212
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:11,210
Don't avoid the question! Let me go.

213
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,680
Answer me. Answer me, you scumbag!

214
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,190
Come on.

215
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,819
Here's the forensic report.

216
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:24,900
Those were animal bones.

217
00:20:25,029 --> 00:20:26,559
They found no human DNA.

218
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,089
We'll imprison him first
then interrogate him more.

219
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,819
That seems unlikely.

220
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:56,660
He was at the scene
as a mere photographer.

221
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,059
We'll have to push forward with it.

222
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:00,430
It was him who spilled
about a woman's death.

223
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,799
And what was that about your mom?

224
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,440
We need all the help we can get
to get an arrest warrant.

225
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,849
Why don't you tell us
about the memory you have?

226
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,049
What are you going to write?

227
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,049
That I could've seen a woman die
20 years ago...

228
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,319
and that lunatic,
who claimed to be a shaman,

229
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,890
mentioned it?

230
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,089
We'll investigate keeping in mind
he may not be detained.

231
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,400
All the men
should keep an eye on him.

232
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,299
That's a given,
but we need evidence first.

233
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,200
He's going to kill once again
like he said.

234
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
- Do you believe him?
- Yes, I do.

235
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,440
He's going to kill three more.

236
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,410
Do you expect us to watch him
until he kills again?

237
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,710
He said...

238
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,880
that three more will die
by the end of this month.

239
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,450
And we have 10 days left.

240
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,519
He will carry out his killings
before then.

241
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,049
Seeing how confident he was,

242
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,890
I'm sure he's planning something.

243
00:21:56,890 --> 00:21:59,420
He's not the only one
who's confident.

244
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,329
I have no plans on letting him
get his way either.

245
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:17,170
(Criminal Division)

246
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:42,200
Thank you for seeing me out.

247
00:22:43,029 --> 00:22:44,299
I had to since something
smells rotten.

248
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,900
We'll see you again soon.

249
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,109
By the way,

250
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,680
the reason for the rotten smell
lies somewhere else.

251
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,490
What?

252
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,490
You two are being swarmed...

253
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,119
by vengeful spirits.

254
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:09,460
You won't stop talking nonsense,
will you?

255
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,910
Two women...

256
00:23:25,579 --> 00:23:27,509
had to kill each other.

257
00:23:32,019 --> 00:23:34,150
If they didn't,
they would be the ones to die...

258
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,589
in the hands of the murderer.

259
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:38,859
If you're so sure,
show us the evidence.

260
00:23:38,859 --> 00:23:41,190
The vengeful spirits
are warning me...

261
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,369
that a murder will take place...

262
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,569
tonight.

263
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:10,920
Please stop it from happening...

264
00:24:12,859 --> 00:24:14,019
if you can.

265
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:17,859
Because that death...

266
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,069
would be on you.

267
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,069
- What?
- Sure.

268
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,440
Whichever jail you end up in
will be thanks to me.

269
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,619
"Tonight"?

270
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:48,390
How entertaining.
He's crazier than I thought.

271
00:24:48,789 --> 00:24:50,960
He'll make a move tonight.

272
00:24:51,329 --> 00:24:53,099
That's the game he wants to play.

273
00:24:53,529 --> 00:24:54,700
He wants to prove...

274
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,470
he's above us.

275
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:23,589
(Green Movers)

276
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:36,839
Don't lose him even for a second.

277
00:25:37,069 --> 00:25:40,309
We need to block him from
contacting any accomplices.

278
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,710
Yes, ma'am.

279
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,150
I don't care.
If we lose him, we lose him.

280
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:47,279
What?
But he said he'll kill tonight.

281
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,789
Do you still not get it?
We searched every nook and cranny.

282
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,559
He's the real Executioner.

283
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:56,160
Even if one more person
dies tonight, it's not a big deal.

284
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,299
As long as we don't lose him,
that's all that matters.

285
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:00,160
But...

286
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,339
What is he doing
with the lights off?

287
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,579
- What about infrared imaging?
- None. No thermal imagery either.

288
00:26:16,609 --> 00:26:19,680
There are dozens surrounding him.
How can he commit murder?

289
00:27:11,799 --> 00:27:13,000
The sun is up.

290
00:27:13,869 --> 00:27:14,970
Check for any cases.

291
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,509
Only a couple of accidental deaths
have been reported.

292
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:22,609
Senior Superintendent Han.

293
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:26,079
There was a murder.

294
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:28,319
- A murder?
- Who was killed?

295
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,359
The victim is someone
you know very well too.

296
00:27:44,170 --> 00:27:45,640
I came late at night
to get my stuff...

297
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,599
because I didn't want
to run into him.

298
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:50,869
But when I got here...

299
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,680
A murder will take place...

300
00:28:00,950 --> 00:28:02,089
tonight.

301
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,460
Rape and blackmail.

302
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,559
A thug with a hammer tattoo.

303
00:28:13,930 --> 00:28:15,400
You two had a bad relationship,
right?

304
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:18,029
Sir, can you get someone
to protect me?

305
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,740
I'm going to be next.

306
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,859
What's with him?

307
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,759
- He heard something.
- He heard something?

308
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:09,190
Could Jin Jae Gyu
really be a shaman?

309
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:12,289
It's impossible for him to do this.
There are so many guarding him.

310
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:13,359
Watch your mouth.

311
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,920
Could it be a different person
taking their revenge?

312
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:16,660
He has a lot of enemies.

313
00:29:17,529 --> 00:29:18,599
It's the Executioner.

314
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:21,430
He's eliminating devils
in a devilish way.

315
00:29:22,269 --> 00:29:23,869
The Executioner used a camcorder
just like the criminal.

316
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,369
I wonder what the ink was for.

317
00:29:29,670 --> 00:29:30,809
How interesting.

318
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,509
The murderer was recording
with the camcorder...

319
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,109
when they beat him to death.

320
00:29:42,089 --> 00:29:43,190
You startled me.

321
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:46,789
What is this?

322
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,630
Who are you?

323
00:30:00,869 --> 00:30:01,910
Stay still.

324
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,150
Wait. Wait.

325
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,220
What did I do wrong?

326
00:30:26,329 --> 00:30:28,630
Let's fast forward
to when they throw it.

327
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:41,609
It only caught their feet.

328
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,009
- Go to when he closed the window.
- Yes, ma'am.

329
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:51,690
Play it slower.

330
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,059
Stop. Brighten it.

331
00:30:56,589 --> 00:30:57,690
Brighten it as much as possible.

332
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:04,630
- His face is black.
- What is that?

333
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,569
Is he a ghost?

334
00:31:09,309 --> 00:31:10,410
A mask...

335
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,140
Did you say it's a mask?

336
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,680
We're done for.

337
00:31:18,349 --> 00:31:19,680
The wolf has left his den.

338
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,319
It looks like he's going for a walk.

339
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,160
Field Team Seven. We'll follow him.

340
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,359
He stopped at the three-way street.

341
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,569
- Could it be a copycat crime?
- How is that possible?

342
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:45,410
Only the investigation team
knows about the Executioner.

343
00:31:45,509 --> 00:31:47,079
Could it be an accomplice?

344
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:49,309
No, we ruled that out
from the beginning.

345
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:50,950
He wasn't in contact with anyone.

346
00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:53,880
- Did he make any calls?
- He's clean.

347
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,519
He didn't write
any emails or call anyone.

348
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,690
We checked every phone number
using the neighborhood base station,

349
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:01,319
and nothing looked suspicious.

350
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,869
Where are you going?

351
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,140
Where are you going?

352
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,869
Gosh.

353
00:32:19,339 --> 00:32:21,980
Okay, who wants to take pictures
with Podori?

354
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,180
- Me!
- Me!

355
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,420
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

356
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,380
It was a boy,
but they all look the same.

357
00:32:28,579 --> 00:32:29,690
They all look different to me.

358
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:31,690
Hurry up and check. At this rate,
I won't get any pension.

359
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:35,460
- Me!
- Me!

360
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,930
All right, come in!

361
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,769
- What is it now?
- It's too thick.

362
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,109
Come on.

363
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:12,799
A kid from the neighborhood?

364
00:33:13,259 --> 00:33:15,200
His mom seemed suspicious.

365
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,799
They used the kid's phone
every time.

366
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:18,740
Did you perform an illegal scan?

367
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:21,670
You're so stubborn.
This is no time to think about that.

368
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,410
We cannot use evidence
that's corrupt.

369
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,109
I'm not even a part
of the investigation team.

370
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:28,279
Get a warrant to review the number
since he contacted the kid's mother.

371
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:31,680
Go to Jin Jae Gyu's house
in two hours.

372
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:33,380
If we don't catch them now,
we'll have to wait for a week.

373
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,190
It takes at least half a day
to process a warrant.

374
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,920
Get it in two hours even if it means
you have to twist the judge's arm.

375
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:48,000
6414, 6414, pull over.

376
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,700
Pull over to the shoulder.

377
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,949
I think your tires are low on air.

378
00:34:09,449 --> 00:34:10,920
I just refilled them yesterday.

379
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,289
It must be the engine oil.

380
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:16,489
I changed the engine oil
yesterday too.

381
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:21,360
Good job. You changed
your engine oil on time.

382
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:24,869
My wife only knows how to drive.
She doesn't even get car washes.

383
00:34:28,369 --> 00:34:29,869
(You have a text message.)

384
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:31,809
The warrant is out.

385
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:33,610
Get to work.

386
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,489
Yes, it's me.

387
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:50,190
The world's only man
with superpowers.

388
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,130
Would you like to take
a picture together?

389
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:53,829
Sure.

390
00:34:58,869 --> 00:35:00,469
Hello. Do you want to take
a picture together?

391
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:02,070
Thank you.

392
00:35:04,739 --> 00:35:06,239
Gosh.

393
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:10,010
Hey, why don't you hold up
the little boy?

394
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:11,409
- Should I?
- Yes.

395
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,719
Okay. 1, 2, 3. Here we go.

396
00:35:15,349 --> 00:35:16,849
Let's be more friendly.

397
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:25,929
I think it'd be better
to get a close-up shot.

398
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:28,630
Or is it better to get a full shot?

399
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,889
(Okay)

400
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,389
Okay, it's ready. Here I go.

401
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,260
1, 2, 3.

402
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,670
Stay with him, okay?

403
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,699
Mr. Jin!

404
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:11,010
You're here.

405
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,750
Are you using your phone well?

406
00:36:25,489 --> 00:36:26,619
Go and play.

407
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,940
It's a secured messenger
from Russia.

408
00:36:48,239 --> 00:36:49,710
It leaves no traces.

409
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,280
He's was an accomplice
to the murders using that.

410
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:55,420
Once he puts in the password,
we'll get to see...

411
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,090
who he was in contact with.

412
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,980
- Hey.
- What?

413
00:37:26,449 --> 00:37:28,679
What? No, no.

414
00:37:29,349 --> 00:37:31,019
(Do you want to remove this app?)

415
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:38,159
He even removed the app.

416
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,360
Maybe he's onto us.

417
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:43,030
Darn it.

418
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,699
Is he a real shaman?

419
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:49,170
I got the list of call records.

420
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:50,809
The red ones are the numbers
Jin Jae Gyu called in secret.

421
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:53,840
(Call Records)

422
00:37:55,679 --> 00:37:56,909
They're the same number.

423
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:01,050
Whose number is it?

424
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:05,019
It's a corporate number.
It's under a broadcasting company.

425
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:06,989
A broadcasting company?

426
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:10,630
A guest has entered the wolf's den.

427
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,989
It's not possible to check
if it's a regular.

428
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,730
What are you doing here, Mr. Cho?

429
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,659
Would you like some tea?

430
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:53,440
Is there a problem?

431
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,110
Of course, there is.
Murder accomplices are gathering.

432
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:57,969
"Accomplices"?

433
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:00,780
What are you conspiring?

434
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:03,750
You have no decency.

435
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,719
We received a report. What is it?

436
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:07,780
A report of a murder?

437
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:10,150
It's going to be shocking news.

438
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:13,090
The rude young girl
who came to see me...

439
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,389
a long time ago was actually you.

440
00:39:14,989 --> 00:39:16,690
He deserves to know.

441
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,559
He had to go through trouble too.

442
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:21,829
It's perfect
for a documentary special.

443
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,000
The daughter of a murder victim...

444
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,039
joins the police
to take her revenge.

445
00:39:26,139 --> 00:39:27,170
It's so dramatic.

446
00:39:27,739 --> 00:39:30,039
- It's my mission as the police.
- I respect your tenacity.

447
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,210
Are you going to conspire
with a murderer so frankly?

448
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:36,050
How can you claim
a false fact in front of us?

449
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,719
Is this considered defamation
or contempt?

450
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,280
Do you two know?

451
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:45,190
Jae Gyu... I mean Mr. Jin
has a surprising talent.

452
00:39:45,289 --> 00:39:48,219
He just mentioned the embarrassing
secret I've kept to myself...

453
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,530
and surprised me.

454
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:52,530
I was begging him to work
on a special project with me.

455
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,130
You seem to be having fun
with a murderer.

456
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,900
I guess
this could be considered contempt.

457
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,800
Are you really a murderer?

458
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:02,869
Personally, I think...

459
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:06,579
that Executioner or whoever
is very bold.

460
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,550
The law is too soft and it couldn't
get rid of those animals,

461
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:10,550
but he got rid of them for us.

462
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,480
Like an incinerator, you don't want
near your house...

463
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:15,380
but desperately need one close by.

464
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,420
Right?

465
00:40:19,159 --> 00:40:22,119
I'm sorry to say this,

466
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,860
but if Mr. Jin is the Executioner,
it wouldn't be bad for me.

467
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:27,199
I can get his exclusive interview.

468
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:31,400
Is there anyone else who questioned
the definition of justice...

469
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,369
in this country
like the Executioner did?

470
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,769
Is your viewership more important
than people's lives?

471
00:40:36,309 --> 00:40:37,409
"Lives"?

472
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,210
Let me ask you this
while we're on the topic.

473
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:42,650
I guess you still can't admit...

474
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:45,710
that your father deserved to die.

475
00:40:45,710 --> 00:40:48,550
- Shut your mouth.
- Blood is thicker than water,

476
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,389
but your father wasn't even worth
taking revenge on.

477
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,920
- Jerk.
- Are you going to take your chance?

478
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,829
She fulfilled her duty.
Revenge is my expertise.

479
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,530
Got that?

480
00:40:59,829 --> 00:41:01,429
How dare you touch someone
from the press?

481
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,969
Go ahead and sue me.

482
00:41:02,969 --> 00:41:04,469
I'll make sure to help you
leave a lasting record in court.

483
00:41:04,699 --> 00:41:07,199
I'll prove how the press
used murder to become successful.

484
00:41:07,199 --> 00:41:09,139
- You little...
- Don't touch him.

485
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,679
Don't put your hands on someone
so recklessly.

486
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,849
- Should I break your neck too?
- Don't you get it?

487
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:21,650
The three people who will die
have something in common.

488
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:25,590
They were
all physically contacted...

489
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,429
by you.

490
00:41:38,099 --> 00:41:39,239
What do you mean?

491
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:40,599
Three people are going to die?

492
00:41:48,679 --> 00:41:50,110
They'll die...

493
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:53,250
horrible deaths.

494
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:58,750
Once the moon starts to get full,

495
00:42:00,389 --> 00:42:03,329
those whose skin you've touched
will die terrible deaths.

496
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:06,929
One already died.

497
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,070
The other two will die soon.

498
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:34,989
Will they really kill the people
you've touched?

499
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:36,190
I think so.

500
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,989
- What if it's a trick?
- Of course, it's a trick.

501
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:42,329
There's no way he knows
who I touched.

502
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:43,670
Unless he's a real shaman.

503
00:42:44,469 --> 00:42:46,539
Then will he kill
someone randomly? No.

504
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,840
That's not something he would do.

505
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:53,110
Of course, he'll kill someone that
I touched, in order to gain victory.

506
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:56,909
- Then...
- Let's go check how right he is.

507
00:43:01,519 --> 00:43:03,690
We'll return your phone
after getting it restored.

508
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:07,059
Our phone was used for a crime?

509
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:08,389
What kind of crime is it?

510
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,059
We can't tell you
since it's confidential information.

511
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:12,559
But we must know who it is.

512
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:13,960
It means it's someone
near our child.

513
00:43:14,199 --> 00:43:16,070
We're watching the suspect
24 hours...

514
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,530
I can't give you my phone
if you don't tell me.

515
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:18,570
It's Jin Jae Gyu.

516
00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:21,269
Mr. Jin?

517
00:43:21,269 --> 00:43:22,869
What on earth...

518
00:43:23,869 --> 00:43:25,039
Just don't go near him.

519
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,650
How did he manage the greenhouse?

520
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,480
Oh, about two months ago,

521
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,550
it wasn't long since he moved to the
neighborhood when he came to me.

522
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:38,349
He said he wanted to buy a tool.

523
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:40,690
I run a small export business.

524
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,690
What type of tool?

525
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:46,300
He said he was repairing
his home and asked for...

526
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,699
Right, a water pump.

527
00:43:48,130 --> 00:43:49,159
A water pump?

528
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,730
He said his basement was flooded.

529
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:53,699
I told him that renting it
would be cheaper,

530
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,539
but he kept insisting on buying it.

531
00:43:55,639 --> 00:43:57,139
I usually don't sell to individuals,

532
00:43:57,139 --> 00:44:00,139
but since he lived nearby and all,
I gave him one.

533
00:44:00,579 --> 00:44:02,280
And a few days later,
he brought a phone.

534
00:44:03,150 --> 00:44:04,610
He said someone gave it to him,

535
00:44:04,849 --> 00:44:08,250
but he preferred to use his
phone, so he gave it to our kid.

536
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:11,719
That day, he saw me run
a flower shop...

537
00:44:11,719 --> 00:44:13,320
and asked me to manage
the greenhouse.

538
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,210
Why aren't you getting in?

539
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,519
That's everyone I touched.

540
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:42,949
Find out who he will target
among them.

541
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:49,159
In case he turns out to be
a real shaman.

542
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,690
Why isn't my name in here?

543
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,559
I'll stay here.

544
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:56,769
I have something left to do.

545
00:45:00,269 --> 00:45:03,210
- Yes?
- Ma'am, you need to see the news.

546
00:45:03,610 --> 00:45:04,769
It's true.

547
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:05,940
(Police Interview)

548
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,880
Her father was killed
due to a grudge.

549
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:10,710
She's been poking around that
cold case for years.

550
00:45:10,710 --> 00:45:13,349
He was a really dirty man,
so I guess that's why he was killed.

551
00:45:13,349 --> 00:45:14,480
This is a serious problem.

552
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:17,449
She's mixing personal emotions
with her authority.

553
00:45:17,849 --> 00:45:20,289
A victim isn't supposed to
investigate his or her own case.

554
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,559
It's not just against the law,
but it's common practice.

555
00:45:22,659 --> 00:45:25,730
The daughter of a victim is trying
to get revenge irrationality...

556
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:27,960
and this is a serious problem
of abuse of governmental authority.

557
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:30,329
We will find out more
about this issue tomorrow.

558
00:45:30,699 --> 00:45:32,969
This is Park Se Myeong of TVC News.

559
00:45:36,570 --> 00:45:39,369
The news was total rubbish,
but this situation is frustrating.

560
00:45:39,579 --> 00:45:41,340
The daughter of a victim
killed by the Executioner...

561
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,610
seeks revenge after 20 years?

562
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:45,150
Goodness, and there's nothing
we can do about it.

563
00:45:46,349 --> 00:45:50,519
That mouth. That mouth of yours
is the problem.

564
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:52,889
Goodness.

565
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:20,550
How's the phone restoration going?

566
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:23,889
Forensics said it can't be done
within a day.

567
00:46:24,619 --> 00:46:27,260
- Keep pressuring them.
- We are, but...

568
00:46:27,489 --> 00:46:30,360
This is the Field Team Nine.
We have two chicks at the site.

569
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:36,030
Two chicks are wandering about
the area.

570
00:46:36,769 --> 00:46:38,630
Where will we find a water pump?

571
00:46:39,570 --> 00:46:42,099
He didn't even explain.
All he does is give out orders.

572
00:46:42,769 --> 00:46:44,010
You really don't know?

573
00:46:44,139 --> 00:46:47,239
Why Det. Dong does as he pleases
around you?

574
00:46:47,409 --> 00:46:49,010
I know it's because of my
fine character.

575
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:50,980
You don't have to point it out.

576
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,420
No, it's because you are...

577
00:46:53,820 --> 00:46:55,849
a pushover. That's why
he's using you.

578
00:46:55,849 --> 00:46:57,150
You're starting to sound like him.

579
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:00,760
You always complain,
but do whatever he asks.

580
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,119
That's why he's looking down on you.

581
00:47:02,289 --> 00:47:04,230
That's all because of
my big picture.

582
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:07,730
What big picture? Working until
you retire? Receiving a pension?

583
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:11,699
Deep inside the heart of
this great man you see,

584
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:14,800
there's an important reason
that's hard to explain.

585
00:47:15,269 --> 00:47:17,070
- You are a pushover.
- You little...

586
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,909
- Let's go and check.
- Okay.

587
00:47:27,949 --> 00:47:29,179
What shall we do?

588
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,260
Leave them be.

589
00:47:36,789 --> 00:47:39,530
Field Team Nine. Don't chase
the chicks and keep watching them.

590
00:47:40,829 --> 00:47:41,829
(Personnel Announcement)

591
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:47,340
Senior Superintendent Han, there's
been a personnel announcement.

592
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,610
(Personnel Announcement
Senior Superintendent Han Sun Mi)

593
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:51,809
"Standby for appointment"?

594
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:56,710
This is Lee Seul Bi
of the situation room.

595
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:01,519
Yes, I understand.

596
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:04,849
Ma'am,

597
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,920
the headquarters has summoned you.

598
00:48:17,829 --> 00:48:19,670
Our first target is Han Sun Mi,

599
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:21,269
and our final target is Dong Baek.

600
00:48:21,269 --> 00:48:24,409
Dispatch all our teams on this.
Focus all our resources...

601
00:48:24,409 --> 00:48:25,710
to bring them down.

602
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:27,980
Yes, sir. But what shall we write
the story about?

603
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,179
- It doesn't matter.
- I see.

604
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,849
Habitual violence won't cut it.

605
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,280
We need something stronger
and dirtier.

606
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,219
Anything that will bring them down!

607
00:48:37,219 --> 00:48:39,050
Shall we dig into
Dong Baek's personal life?

608
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,789
Do you call that a question?
Why you little...

609
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:44,230
Bring me every dirty little secret!

610
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,630
The local news team
has a hidden card, right?

611
00:48:49,329 --> 00:48:50,429
Hidden card?

612
00:48:50,429 --> 00:48:52,599
Yes, I've managed to link
a connection with them.

613
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:55,940
- How?
- They really hate reporters,

614
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:59,440
but I've gone through hoops
to build a connection with them.

615
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,139
A very sturdy connection.

616
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:07,150
Our rookie?

617
00:49:11,619 --> 00:49:13,960
You better do a good job.

618
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,559
Whether you wiretap him
or use a hidden camera,

619
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:19,230
bring me something dirty on
Dong Baek by all means.

620
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:23,500
Your career depends on this.

621
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,010
Why did you do it?

622
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:08,139
Are you familiar with dogs?

623
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:12,980
The dog who barks first
means it's scared...

624
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,480
to bite first.

625
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:18,650
The dog that's confident
doesn't bark and just leaps forward.

626
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:21,820
I didn't know you were
an expert on dogs.

627
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,559
The press is like dogs.

628
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,989
They can't even look at me straight
in person...

629
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,829
but they bark in front of
the camera...

630
00:50:27,829 --> 00:50:29,329
and use their pens
pretending to be brave.

631
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,570
Why? Because the more they bark,

632
00:50:32,030 --> 00:50:33,869
they know the TV and newspapers...

633
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:36,269
will become shields to protect them.

634
00:50:37,139 --> 00:50:40,010
So? Is that why you reacted
immediately after they barked?

635
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,610
What do you have to do
to quiet down dogs?

636
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:45,349
You have to their crush
their muzzles.

637
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,789
That's why you're no naive.

638
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:54,289
If you step on one dog,
all the dogs bark like crazy.

639
00:50:54,289 --> 00:50:55,559
Why?

640
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,659
Because that's how those cowards
survive.

641
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:01,860
The right thing is to disappear.

642
00:51:03,300 --> 00:51:04,699
And they'll quiet down right away.

643
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:07,570
It feels like you're disguising
the truth.

644
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:09,539
When you've actually been
humiliated by losing.

645
00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:11,110
Why have I been humiliated?

646
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,179
Isn't it humiliating
to fire a commanding officer...

647
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:14,409
that's about to catch
a serial murderer...

648
00:51:14,409 --> 00:51:16,309
because of some rubbish news?

649
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:17,750
Who says I'll fire you?

650
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:20,849
You can keep investigating...

651
00:51:20,849 --> 00:51:21,920
as the head
of the Special Investigation Team.

652
00:51:22,679 --> 00:51:24,050
- But...
- Your standby for appointment...

653
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:25,389
will last a week at most.

654
00:51:25,389 --> 00:51:26,690
If the culprit isn't caught
within that time,

655
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:28,989
you'll be needed for
the investigation and reinstated.

656
00:51:28,989 --> 00:51:32,030
And if the culprit is caught,
you'll be the one to announce it.

657
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,929
You can continue to become
the icon of 120,000 officers...

658
00:51:33,929 --> 00:51:36,360
without even getting a scratch
on your career.

659
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:37,670
I don't need to be praised.

660
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:39,199
A few hours from now is critical.

661
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:41,000
So keep investigating in the dark.

662
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:43,440
I've already told Young Soo.

663
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,840
You'll have the authority
as the head of RIU.

664
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,579
However, don't come to work
for a week and head things remotely.

665
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:56,949
Is that a no?

666
00:51:58,519 --> 00:51:59,590
Thank you.

667
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:02,119
You may go.

668
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:08,929
(President Cho Sung Dong)

669
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:15,940
By any chance, are you close
with President Cho Sung Dong?

670
00:52:18,539 --> 00:52:19,610
What?

671
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:27,380
I've met him once before
at an event. Why?

672
00:52:29,679 --> 00:52:31,590
I'm just wondering if
you've known him long.

673
00:52:32,489 --> 00:52:35,219
For about 20 years?

674
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:40,800
Never mind.

675
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,829
(President Cho Sung Dong)

676
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:53,539
(Missed calls,
President Cho Sung Dong)

677
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:35,380
I found out...

678
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:36,920
Jin Jae Gyu's trick.

679
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:42,659
That place has been vacant
for decades.

680
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:46,030
It used to be owned by
a foreign corporation...

681
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:49,099
and two days ago,
the owner changed.

682
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:50,269
To who?

683
00:53:50,329 --> 00:53:53,070
It's a teenager, and our records
show it's Cho Sung Dong's son.

684
00:53:53,699 --> 00:53:55,739
He's living abroad with his mom,

685
00:53:55,739 --> 00:53:57,369
so Mr. Cho probably registered
for him instead.

686
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:03,239
Old Man, go meet Cho Sung Dong now.

687
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:06,079
- Why?
- Ask why he received this building.

688
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:07,320
Receive it from who?

689
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:08,619
Jin Jae Gyu.

690
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:10,389
Jin Jae Gyu?

691
00:54:11,219 --> 00:54:14,920
But pretend you don't know that.
Just ask why he bought the building.

692
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:19,130
But still, he's the president
of a press company.

693
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,360
Will he suddenly meet me?

694
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,929
He will if you tell him I sent you.

695
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,199
By the way, when will you let me in
on your big picture?

696
00:54:28,469 --> 00:54:30,840
That punk. He always says
only what he wants to say.

697
00:54:31,909 --> 00:54:33,639
Call Mr. Cho's secretary.

698
00:54:35,710 --> 00:54:37,309
You've proven again
that you're a pushover.

699
00:54:39,250 --> 00:54:40,650
Shall I kick him out?

700
00:54:42,019 --> 00:54:43,150
How did you find this place?

701
00:54:43,949 --> 00:54:44,989
The water pump.

702
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,420
Right, a water pump.

703
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:50,460
There was no water pump
anywhere in his house.

704
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:53,429
We should request for a warrant...

705
00:55:39,469 --> 00:55:41,809
How did you find this place
with just a water pump?

706
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,710
"Dawn of the Nine".

707
00:55:44,449 --> 00:55:45,579
"Dawn of the Nine"?

708
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:48,150
A World War II movie where
they assassinate a Nazi leader.

709
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,650
Although they succeed with
the assassination,

710
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:52,119
the special forces are trapped
inside the basement of a church.

711
00:55:52,289 --> 00:55:54,159
But they still don't give up
even when they're surrounded.

712
00:55:54,289 --> 00:55:57,090
Why? Because they heard
there was a secret passage...

713
00:55:57,090 --> 00:55:58,159
that ran under the church.

714
00:55:58,889 --> 00:56:00,260
A secret passage?

715
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:14,079
When they eventually failed
to find the secret passage...

716
00:56:14,510 --> 00:56:16,539
and their enemies started
flooding the basement with water,

717
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:19,110
they hugged each other and
committed suicide.

718
00:56:20,150 --> 00:56:21,320
What does that movie
have to do with anything?

719
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,460
That was the movie
he had on his shelf.

720
00:56:28,019 --> 00:56:29,489
But how could that...

721
00:56:29,889 --> 00:56:31,630
The geology books were just
a disguise.

722
00:56:34,829 --> 00:56:37,230
That movie inspired him
to make an escape route?

723
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:39,000
He needed a water pump
because this place was flooded.

724
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:41,900
So I searched for entrances
that had a hose connected to it.

725
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,179
His threats about killing
were just a trick.

726
00:56:47,980 --> 00:56:50,079
- He wanted to make an alibi...
- Wait.

727
00:58:58,309 --> 00:58:59,510
It's a greenhouse.

728
00:59:01,909 --> 00:59:03,480
Let's set up a trap...

729
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,010
- and wait until...
- It's too late.

730
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:17,329
A motorcycle?

731
00:59:45,789 --> 00:59:48,260
Jin Jae Gyu escaped through
the secret passageway.

732
00:59:48,619 --> 00:59:50,190
Find out where that motorcycle
is going now.

733
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,090
Tracking that in real-time
is impossible.

734
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:55,329
The phone has been restored.
Jin Jae Gyu has searched two names.

735
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,099
It's Choi Poong Won
and Prosecutor Oh Seok Do.

736
01:00:02,070 --> 01:00:03,070
Darn it.

737
01:00:10,449 --> 01:00:11,710
They're both worth killing.

738
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:17,320
- Can you say something?
- Please say something.

739
01:00:18,150 --> 01:00:19,750
- How do you feel?
- Make way.

740
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,360
- Please say something.
- Move.

741
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,460
- Please share a word!
- Make way!

742
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:25,190
Despite committing numerous
misdeeds,

743
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:26,889
he used his illness as an excuse
to live comfortably.

744
01:00:29,230 --> 01:00:30,900
Now is not the time...

745
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:32,699
You punk.

746
01:00:34,769 --> 01:00:36,170
After interfering with
the investigation,

747
01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:38,940
he made that innocent girl
Ye Rim die and even got promoted.

748
01:00:40,139 --> 01:00:41,679
He's at a golf club.

749
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:43,579
Nothing unusual here.

750
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:47,920
Although you touched both of them,
it isn't Choi Poong Won.

751
01:00:48,019 --> 01:00:49,820
Once the moon starts to get full...

752
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:51,690
Oh Seok Do.

753
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:57,030
What is it?

754
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:58,789
Something's bugging me.

755
01:00:59,829 --> 01:01:01,429
He seems like obvious bait.

756
01:01:02,329 --> 01:01:03,599
It's too obvious?

757
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:07,139
It feels like we've
missed something.

758
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:11,340
It's this.

759
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:13,340
The murder patterns.

760
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:16,809
Jin Jae Gyu used paste bait
to lure us in.

761
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,250
By leaving hints next to the bodies.

762
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:23,820
But we've already found out
his identity...

763
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:24,849
No.

764
01:01:24,989 --> 01:01:27,260
This is about his pride, which
is more important than his life.

765
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:30,559
In order for a perfect victory,
the game rules must be maintained.

766
01:01:38,099 --> 01:01:39,699
The clothes on those
plastered bodies.

767
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,099
Like this word, "hammer".

768
01:01:46,039 --> 01:01:47,179
Oh Yeon Tak.

769
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,139
Show me the pictures
from the scene.

770
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:57,949
It wasn't Oh Seok Do either.

771
01:02:01,219 --> 01:02:02,590
He was untrustworthy
from the beginning.

772
01:02:08,900 --> 01:02:10,929
- What?
- Find out his current location now.

773
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:12,699
Get to work!

774
01:02:14,039 --> 01:02:15,300
Call and check right now.

775
01:02:18,769 --> 01:02:20,210
Answer the phone!

776
01:02:25,880 --> 01:02:26,980
No.

777
01:02:27,449 --> 01:02:28,550
Stop.

778
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,420
Don't come near me.

779
01:02:36,159 --> 01:02:38,159
Don't you know who I am?

780
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:40,599
I'm Cho Sung Dong, the man
who leads the press of this country!

781
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:11,730
Freeze!

782
01:03:14,099 --> 01:03:15,230
Hands up.

783
01:03:17,369 --> 01:03:18,500
On your knees.

784
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:34,619
Don't even make a move,
or I'll bury a bullet in your head.

785
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,059
What are you doing?

786
01:03:45,159 --> 01:03:46,260
Snap out of it.

787
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:51,570
Snap out of it!

788
01:04:25,530 --> 01:04:26,670
Wait.

789
01:04:31,369 --> 01:04:32,539
Where are we?

790
01:04:38,909 --> 01:04:41,449
Wait. This is...

791
01:05:47,150 --> 01:05:48,719
I can't see anything important.

792
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,150
As if it's been cut out
with a razor blade.

793
01:05:50,579 --> 01:05:53,019
Jin Jae Gyu has a superpower
that can erase memories.

794
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,590
How did you control your accomplice?

795
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:57,860
They're paying for the sins
committed by their family.

796
01:05:57,860 --> 01:05:59,059
He is evil.

797
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:00,190
What is his purpose?

798
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:02,630
The big picture he intends to draw
by fooling us?

799
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:05,400
You touched that kid too
with your dirty hands.

800
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:08,369
What if the third target
isn't a kid?

801
01:06:08,769 --> 01:06:11,170
No!

802
01:06:11,170 --> 01:06:12,210
What if...

803
01:06:12,809 --> 01:06:13,840
it's me?
