5
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,359
Jin Jae Gyu escaped through
the secret passageway.

6
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:01,000
Jin Jae Gyu used paste bait
to lure us in.

7
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:03,270
By leaving hints next to the bodies.

8
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,799
It wasn't Oh Seok Do either.

9
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,670
- Jerk.
- He was touched by you too.

10
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,709
Don't you know who I am?

11
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,980
I'm Cho Sung Dong, the man
who leads the press of this country!

12
00:01:21,019 --> 00:01:22,019
Freeze!

13
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,989
Don't even make a move,
or I'll bury a bullet in your head.

14
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:31,530
Snap out of it.

15
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,230
Snap out of it!

16
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:44,010
Wait.

17
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:47,310
Where are we?

18
00:03:39,189 --> 00:03:40,259
Det. Oh.

19
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,659
I can't remember...

20
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,270
no matter how hard I try.

21
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,610
I feel like...

22
00:03:55,009 --> 00:03:56,810
I saw someone.

23
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,210
The security cameras are down.

24
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:04,280
The lines were cut even before
we broke in.

25
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,189
Senior Superintendent Han, we've
stationed men at the secret passage.

26
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,389
How many?

27
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,889
We have six for now,
but we're trying to get more.

28
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,660
Arrest him before he enters
the passage.

29
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:21,029
We need to check
for the victim's bloodstains.

30
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:22,399
Confiscate his clothes and shoes.

31
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:23,970
"Victim"?

32
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,699
Cho Sung Dong was attacked.

33
00:04:27,009 --> 00:04:28,269
Should we call an ambulance?

34
00:04:30,509 --> 00:04:31,579
No, just the forensics team.

35
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,410
I can't see anything important.

36
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:39,220
As if it's been cut out
with a razor blade.

37
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,019
How strange.

38
00:04:45,189 --> 00:04:47,529
He can control people's memories
at will.

39
00:04:50,459 --> 00:04:52,360
We should've realized it
with Park Gi Dan's case.

40
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:57,240
I can't believe it...

41
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,839
although it's happening to me.

42
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,639
He was killed with a fountain pen.

43
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,910
He was punished with a pen for
the crimes he committed with a pen.

44
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:08,750
This will be the end
for the criminal.

45
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:17,860
(Episode 8: Red Herring)

46
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,259
Did you track
the motorcycle's line of movement?

47
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,560
Not yet.

48
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,730
The metropolitan police
situation room is on it too.

49
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,459
What about the secret passage?

50
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:26,600
We've sent everyone possible
and they're on standby.

51
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,000
Warn all of them that...

52
00:05:28,129 --> 00:05:30,470
Jin Jae Gyu has a superpower
that can erase memories.

53
00:05:30,899 --> 00:05:32,699
Pardon? Can he erase memories?

54
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,670
Tell them to avoid
physical contact if possible.

55
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,709
- Yes, ma'am.
- This is a message to everyone.

56
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:40,949
The target has the ability
to erase memories.

57
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,149
I repeat.
The target has a superpower,

58
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:44,279
so be cautious not to contact him.

59
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:47,050
- He can erase memories.
- Was it really a superpower?

60
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,759
Sir.

61
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:27,930
He's coming.

62
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,639
He's on his way.

63
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:49,509
I found him.

64
00:06:52,019 --> 00:06:53,079
Where?

65
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,689
This is 5km away
from Jin Jae Gyu's house.

66
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:58,019
But this was 50 minutes ago.

67
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,360
"50 minutes ago"?

68
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,790
What direction was he going?

69
00:07:00,959 --> 00:07:02,389
Towards his house.

70
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,300
- What?
- Then this is before our stakeout.

71
00:07:07,529 --> 00:07:10,000
Sir, I see a person here.

72
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,839
- There's someone in his garden.
- Who?

73
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,420
The times don't match.

74
00:07:31,459 --> 00:07:33,930
He disappeared after erasing
Old Man's memories 80 minutes ago.

75
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:39,100
Then when we left
the secret passage...

76
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,769
He had returned
after killing Cho Sung Dong.

77
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:51,240
We missed him by a hair.

78
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:53,439
We should've stayed there.

79
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:05,620
Don't let him find out
we know about the secret passage.

80
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:08,089
That'll be our final card
to set a trap.

81
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:11,360
Hey.

82
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:25,579
Is there already a second victim?

83
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,209
How did you give orders
to your accomplice?

84
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,379
- Accomplice?
- Did you think giving him orders...

85
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:33,779
while you were indoors
would clear your name?

86
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,389
Accomplice?

87
00:08:36,789 --> 00:08:38,059
It could be the opposite.

88
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,090
He may look like
he's the mastermind,

89
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,330
but he's nothing more than a puppet
who follows orders.

90
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:45,429
He may just be a pathetic puppet
that's used as bait.

91
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,500
You're upset...

92
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,299
as always.

93
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:54,309
I understand
that Det. Dong is upset.

94
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:57,110
People he's touched
are dying left and right.

95
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:59,110
But not you.

96
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,750
- Cut that nonsense.
- There's no reason to be upset.

97
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:06,679
Your father broke
his co-workers' trust.

98
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,019
What?

99
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,720
He betrayed them.

100
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,159
He represented 2,000 laborers
who were fired, but in court,

101
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:18,600
he gave a false testimony
that went against the labor union.

102
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,929
- Shut it.
- Thousands of fathers...

103
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,269
were on the streets, jobless.

104
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:27,610
However, he received a hefty sum.

105
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:30,710
On top of that,
he was given a new job.

106
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:33,039
- Shut that mouth.
- Countless families broke apart.

107
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,950
They crumbled
due to illnesses and depression.

108
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,279
When the 17th unemployed worker
committed suicide,

109
00:09:40,419 --> 00:09:41,789
karma did its job.

110
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,559
He was stabbed 17 times.

111
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,360
How did you know that?

112
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,399
The number of times he was stabbed
was never revealed.

113
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:56,529
Have you ever wondered...

114
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:00,600
why your father betrayed everyone?

115
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,870
Answer my question.

116
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,009
It was because of you.

117
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,409
He had to support
his genius daughter.

118
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:13,080
Good books, good schools,
promises he made to his late wife...

119
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,850
It's obvious.

120
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:18,690
Fathers become corrupt
for their children.

121
00:10:19,889 --> 00:10:21,889
You can't possibly know
his thoughts...

122
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,860
- if you weren't his murderer...
- I met him.

123
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:29,470
I met his revengeful spirit.

124
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,039
- What?
- You sure know how to blabber.

125
00:10:34,139 --> 00:10:37,139
The Executioner was the happiest...

126
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,409
when he murdered your father.

127
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,210
What a sick psycho.

128
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,120
Mr. Jin Jae Gyu,

129
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,220
you're under arrest
without warrant...

130
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,649
for plotting Cho Sung Dong's death.

131
00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:49,049
You have the right to remain silent.

132
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,350
What's the easy way?

133
00:10:55,129 --> 00:10:56,490
A memory scan?

134
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,299
Scan me.

135
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,340
- Do you mean it?
- Of course.

136
00:11:07,039 --> 00:11:08,269
Why the sudden change of mind?

137
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:13,679
Because the victims
have been chosen.

138
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,350
Even the third one.

139
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,889
Two have died already.

140
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:23,889
There's only one left.

141
00:11:25,159 --> 00:11:27,730
The last one will die
before the end of the month...

142
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,860
because you have touched them.

143
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,210
Sign it.

144
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:47,950
"I, Jin Jae Gyu, agree to be scanned
by Detective Dong Baek."

145
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,649
"I am aware that my memory
can be used as evidence."

146
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:53,779
(Jin Jae Gyu)

147
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,629
- Go.
- Hyun Soo.

148
00:12:08,899 --> 00:12:10,200
Why is he here?

149
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,870
The bus driver said
no one was home.

150
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,809
Then you should've called.

151
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,009
It's the kindergarten's fault.

152
00:12:22,149 --> 00:12:23,679
I never told them
he could watch Hyun Soo.

153
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:26,779
You should get back.

154
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,919
I can't take care of your greenhouse
from now on.

155
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,860
Let's go.

156
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:40,629
My reputation has been tainted
thanks to you.

157
00:12:41,629 --> 00:12:42,929
Did you even have one to begin with?

158
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,190
The Lord's words...

159
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:13,009
It's a curse.

160
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:26,320
Anyone you touch will die.

161
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:45,039
Det. Dong!

162
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,299
Det. Dong!

163
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,940
Wake up! Det. Dong!

164
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:06,490
Hello?

165
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:09,230
No, not yet.

166
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:13,200
Yes.

167
00:18:14,769 --> 00:18:15,930
Okay.

168
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,180
Call me Manager Kim.

169
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,250
Why is the NIS here?

170
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:38,259
I didn't know you could read minds
without touching them.

171
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,529
NIS agents are intelligent fools.

172
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:43,329
You only mentioned your title.

173
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,960
Only swindlers and NIS agents
do that,

174
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,130
but you guys don't know that.

175
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,730
I'm sorry for the late introduction.

176
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,500
I've been in charge
of monitoring you for some time now.

177
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,940
I didn't ask for that.

178
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,140
This is your third time.

179
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,180
You've fainted for the third time.

180
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,380
One of those times
was when you were beaten.

181
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,549
But the other two happened
while you were reading memories.

182
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,480
So what? Will you offer me
a checkup or something?

183
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,220
Yes. It's already done.

184
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,890
They couldn't find anything,
but I'm sure this is a warning.

185
00:19:12,319 --> 00:19:15,430
We believe your condition
will worsen if you continue.

186
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,690
Mind your own business.

187
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,630
I'll take care of myself.

188
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,299
You're a national asset.

189
00:19:21,029 --> 00:19:23,970
Not at all. You guys just want
to use me as a weapon.

190
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:26,400
You won't be able
to keep your job anyway.

191
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:29,210
You'll be found guilty.

192
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,079
If you're done rambling,
you may leave.

193
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:34,009
I'm not asking you to quit your job.

194
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,579
We'll help you keep it.

195
00:19:41,289 --> 00:19:42,990
Don't you know the government
can't get involved...

196
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:44,349
in court affairs these days?

197
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:46,819
You're right.

198
00:19:47,789 --> 00:19:49,490
But we can change
the public sentiment.

199
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,730
After all, that's our specialty.

200
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:56,730
Even if you're found guilty,
you'll still keep your job.

201
00:19:58,369 --> 00:19:59,440
What's the condition?

202
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:02,809
Nothing much. You just need
to help us every now and then.

203
00:20:03,269 --> 00:20:04,880
You could also help our research.

204
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,509
Or...

205
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:10,480
you could help our country
when we're in need of dire help.

206
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,849
I'll just pay for what I've done.

207
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:15,390
I'm not cheap like that.

208
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,420
Don't you feel the happiest
when you catch criminals?

209
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,289
I hope we'll never meet again.

210
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,359
I'm sure NIS agents
have committed sins as well.

211
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:27,400
Don't make me humiliate you
by exposing your memory.

212
00:20:28,299 --> 00:20:30,799
You don't need to get all worked up.

213
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,069
Baek, you're up.

214
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,910
I'll see you around. Get well soon.

215
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,579
- Who was that?
- A mole.

216
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:47,779
- A mole?
- Why did an NIS agent visit you?

217
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,589
- Where are my clothes?
- You need to rest.

218
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:52,089
You finally woke up after four days.

219
00:20:52,789 --> 00:20:54,460
Four days?
What happened to Jin Jae Gyu?

220
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,460
We arrested him without warrant
and interrogated him for 48 hours.

221
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:00,430
But the warrant was denied,
and he was set free once again.

222
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,029
What?

223
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:04,200
Guess who his lawyer is?

224
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,400
It's Lim Joong Yeon, that scumbag.

225
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:19,150
Unlike how he appears,
he must be really wealthy.

226
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,019
He probably spent
millions of dollars.

227
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:23,490
I think the RIU is setting a trap.

228
00:21:23,589 --> 00:21:24,759
They're going to catch him
red-handed...

229
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:25,920
when he comes out
of the secret tunnel.

230
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,460
Did the forensics team not search
the tunnel?

231
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,630
Of course, they did.

232
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,990
But they couldn't find
Cho Sung Dong's DNA.

233
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,130
Do you think he'll be stupid enough
to come out of there once again?

234
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:34,630
They thought that far
and searched the place...

235
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:37,000
while Jin Jae Gyu was detained.

236
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:38,539
They think
it may come into use later.

237
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:42,039
The Special Investigation Team
is doing everything they can.

238
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,740
We have less than a week
until the end of the month.

239
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,940
- And Senior Superintendent Han?
- I don't know.

240
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,809
I haven't seen her
ever since she was removed.

241
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:52,480
I'm having a hard time these days
since I can't see her.

242
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,619
- You could be her dad.
- Exactly.

243
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:57,690
I'm concerned about her like
a father would for his daughter.

244
00:21:57,690 --> 00:21:59,759
Why did you have
to interpret it like that?

245
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:03,829
You need to rest.

246
00:22:03,829 --> 00:22:06,660
Prof. Ahn and the medical team
are panicking.

247
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,630
They're trying to figure out
why you keep fainting.

248
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:10,269
That scumbag has superpowers.

249
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:13,140
He could control what I could see
when I scanned him.

250
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,809
What?

251
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,809
What? Does that mean
he's more powerful than you?

252
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,039
You may actually die.

253
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:56,809
(Green Moving
Will Make Your Life Easier)

254
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,720
Watch your distance.

255
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,880
Don't let him touch you.

256
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,119
I knew it.
I'm destined to do field work.

257
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:28,150
Wait a minute!

258
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,480
- Wait a minute!
- Sir, stop!

259
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:33,519
Only 1 parrot is chasing him.
I repeat. There's only 1 parrot.

260
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:34,950
Backup.

261
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,019
Help the parrot!

262
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:38,460
Roger that. Turn the car around.

263
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,240
He's heading north
from the bus stop.

264
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,079
Keep this channel available.

265
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:05,680
Backup is on the way, so relax.

266
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,900
He's in the elevator.
I'm checking which floor.

267
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:57,200
Eighth floor.
I'm going up right now.

268
00:24:59,069 --> 00:25:00,099
Eighth floor, got it.

269
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,930
I'm sorry, but we're closed today.

270
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,759
- Sorry?
- We're closed.

271
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:28,269
I'm sorry.

272
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,400
I lost him.

273
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:37,569
He's not at the gym
on the eighth floor.

274
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,730
Are you not getting in?

275
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,710
Parrot. Parrot.

276
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:16,250
What's wrong with this?

277
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,480
She's in the elevator.

278
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,150
Parrot, answer me. Parrot!

279
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:34,029
Are you going to the parking lot?

280
00:26:35,099 --> 00:26:36,130
Sorry?

281
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:38,470
Yes.

282
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,690
By the way, which way
are you headed?

283
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:05,799
It's still under construction,
so there aren't any cars.

284
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:23,009
Okay. The third-floor basement.

285
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:24,079
Yes, sir.

286
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,519
- Take a look.
- How much are the potatoes?

287
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,890
- This is 10 dollars per bag.
- Can I take half?

288
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:31,859
- Take it all. It won't rot.
- Please give me a discount.

289
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,990
You should take it all.
Don't worry, it won't rot.

290
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,430
- Just a little discount.
- It's too hard for me.

291
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,190
- I'll buy more next time.
- Gosh.

292
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:39,900
It's Mr. Jin.

293
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,599
I'm giving you a good price.

294
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,269
I'll take half, then.

295
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,079
Parrot.

296
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:01,349
Where are you? Parrot?

297
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,819
Darn it!

298
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:09,690
Hey. Wake up, wake up.

299
00:28:14,829 --> 00:28:16,000
Where am I?

300
00:28:17,069 --> 00:28:18,539
Please send an ambulance
to the third-floor basement.

301
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:22,109
Don't you remember?
You were tailing him.

302
00:28:23,609 --> 00:28:26,940
No, I went to bed after work.

303
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,049
- What?
- What about your gun?

304
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,109
Where's your gun?

305
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:32,980
Your gun.

306
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,319
- I won't sell like this again.
- Thank you.

307
00:28:36,319 --> 00:28:37,890
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

308
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,559
Come and take a look.

309
00:28:40,859 --> 00:28:41,960
Welcome.

310
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,559
Hyun Soo?

311
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,259
Hyun Soo!

312
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,569
Hyun Soo! Hyun Soo!

313
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,410
Confirm the location of the target.

314
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:59,210
Sorry, sir.
We're searching everywhere.

315
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,539
- It's the target.
- What?

316
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,190
Have you seen my son?

317
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,359
My son said he saw you
at the market.

318
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:28,200
- I'll call the police.
- He paid the price.

319
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:33,039
He just paid the price
in place of his ancestor.

320
00:29:34,809 --> 00:29:36,880
- What do you mean?
- It was passed down to him.

321
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,450
The price your mother
should have paid.

322
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,950
- What do you mean?
- Can't you tell...

323
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,259
who I am?

324
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:50,130
What do you mean?

325
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:52,099
When you were young,

326
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,069
I raised you.

327
00:30:54,019 --> 00:30:55,160
Where's the boy?

328
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:03,500
You touched that kid
with your dirty hands, didn't you?

329
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:11,440
He's now qualified.

330
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,279
- What?
- To become the third scapegoat.

331
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,779
If something happens to him,
I'll kill you.

332
00:31:19,579 --> 00:31:22,150
He was cursed because of you,
so why would I...

333
00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:36,700
He's still here.

334
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:42,609
It'll be tonight.

335
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:47,240
You better hurry.

336
00:31:48,309 --> 00:31:49,450
The third murder...

337
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,950
is going to happen tonight.

338
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,299
Come here. Come out here, you jerk!

339
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:14,140
- Calm down.
- Let me go. Let me go.

340
00:32:14,569 --> 00:32:15,809
- I said, let me go!
- Baek.

341
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:16,910
Come to your senses!

342
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:22,750
What do I do?

343
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:35,789
He's a devil.

344
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:38,029
How long did you live with him?

345
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:39,660
Until I was nine.

346
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,970
You were young.
How are you so sure it was him?

347
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,039
Before my grandma passed away,
I said this like a habit.

348
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:50,569
Mom never committed suicide.

349
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:54,339
He's the one who killed her,

350
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,480
and that the psychopath
will kill us all.

351
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,349
What does the family register say?

352
00:33:00,619 --> 00:33:03,390
Her mother's name was Sim Hyo Sook.
She died in 1992.

353
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:06,359
She ran away with another man
while living with Jin Jae Gyu.

354
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,619
- The two of them committed suicide.
- They found her handwritten will.

355
00:33:10,759 --> 00:33:12,230
I'm sure he killed her.

356
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,500
How are you so sure? It's just
what your grandmother said.

357
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,369
Because she witnessed it.

358
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:35,549
It was just before Mom ran away.

359
00:33:36,549 --> 00:33:37,950
I'm sure it was around then.

360
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,519
She went into town for work
every day.

361
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:44,460
He was my stepfather
and he was always home.

362
00:34:15,559 --> 00:34:17,389
I received a puppy for my birthday.

363
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:20,559
The day he was brought back
after going to the vet...

364
00:34:51,059 --> 00:34:52,159
Dad?

365
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:40,480
My mom ran away from home
right after that.

366
00:35:58,559 --> 00:36:00,199
More than having my mom gone,

367
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,630
being alone with him scared me more.

368
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,369
Because of what you saw
in the forest?

369
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,769
No, I was always scared of him.

370
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:10,909
He was so cold to me.

371
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,880
He became even colder
after Mom disappeared.

372
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:19,880
He was away for a couple of days,
then I heard him return one night.

373
00:37:04,329 --> 00:37:05,659
He had found Mom.

374
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,929
He brought the necklace back to me.

375
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:19,539
But I only realized much later...

376
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,809
what happened then.

377
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,849
Cheer up.

378
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:12,829
I ran off to my grandma's house
right then.

379
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:26,440
Jae Gyu, I'm sorry.
Please forgive me.

380
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,480
Please don't kill me.

381
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,780
Mom's skeleton was found hanging
along with her boyfriend's.

382
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,320
Please don't kill me.

383
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:36,789
But I know...

384
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,260
she was killed...

385
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,559
in his hands.

386
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:45,860
Your memories are so clear.

387
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,260
How come you couldn't recognize him?

388
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,500
Even the house is the same.

389
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,599
I was only nine years old.
How can I remember everything?

390
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,869
It's natural to forget.

391
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,210
What's strange is that some details
are very clear.

392
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,239
How did you come
to this neighborhood?

393
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,079
Because this is
where my husband lives.

394
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:04,280
What a strange coincidence.

395
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:10,320
Hey, what time did you say
your husband boarded his plane?

396
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:13,389
At 12pm. We were on our way back
after seeing him off.

397
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,690
We'll be able to call him
in the evening.

398
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,030
This is no time
to look for my husband.

399
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:20,800
You have to arrest Jin Jae Gyu
and find my son.

400
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,849
Let's arrest him again.

401
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,750
Arrest who?

402
00:39:45,690 --> 00:39:47,960
You failed to interrogate him twice.

403
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:49,090
What will you do with him?

404
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,329
Catch him at the murder scene...

405
00:39:51,329 --> 00:39:52,599
when he leaves
through the secret passage.

406
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,730
A child's life is at stake.

407
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,099
They only executed garbage.

408
00:39:58,570 --> 00:40:00,400
He's trying to take his revenge
on the kid's mother.

409
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,500
Det. Dong.

410
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:05,670
Leave the kid to the station
in charge, and focus on the passage.

411
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:08,239
He already warned us he would kill!

412
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,349
That's his trick.

413
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:13,119
He'll make us turn to the kid
then attack us where we're weak.

414
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,849
The Executioner kills only those
who deserve to die.

415
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,320
It sounds like you know...

416
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:20,760
the Executioner very well.

417
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:28,730
Who let him in?

418
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:30,769
Kick him out.

419
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:36,539
Please leave.

420
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:53,659
He'll strike Oh Seok Do first,
but keep watching the others.

421
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,860
Every single name on the list
who Det. Dong touched.

422
00:40:57,059 --> 00:40:58,059
Yes, sir.

423
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:01,699
He might be able to erase memories,
but he can't erase videos.

424
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,230
Record everything in real-time
while on the watch.

425
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,170
Are you crazy?

426
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,369
There's a limit to how much
you can ignore your position.

427
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:12,780
He's number two of the Seoul
Metropolitan Police Agency.

428
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:16,610
I'm only trying to get my pension
after working here until retirement.

429
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,050
Does that bother you that much?

430
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,650
Just shoot me, then.

431
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,920
If I die on the job,

432
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:23,889
at least they'll pay for
my youngest's tuition.

433
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:26,860
Your youngest is smart,
so I bet a scholarship is in store.

434
00:41:27,219 --> 00:41:28,289
Right?

435
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:39,639
(Han Sun Mi)

436
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,400
What did you do? You didn't
come to the hospital to see me.

437
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:46,679
Are we close enough to visit
each other at the hospital?

438
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,010
No, I guess you're right.

439
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,780
I was investigating.

440
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,150
You sound laid back.

441
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,579
I didn't talk back
to Deputy Chief Lee like you...

442
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:55,179
and end up revealing our plan.

443
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:58,590
You got kicked out,
but you have a loyal spy, don't you?

444
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:00,619
- What did you gain from this?
- Half.

445
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,989
- "Half"?
- What did you see in his memories?

446
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,829
- The secret passage.
- What else?

447
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:10,500
That's all. Everything else was
an illusion he was tricking me with.

448
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:13,940
Just the secret passage?

449
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,139
He could control what I saw.

450
00:42:17,039 --> 00:42:18,539
His superpower is much stronger
than yours.

451
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,780
Must you...

452
00:42:21,239 --> 00:42:23,309
poke where it hurts?

453
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,780
He can erase memories
and control them too.

454
00:42:27,050 --> 00:42:28,280
What is the half you gained?

455
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,719
I analyzed the message
left on Cho Sung Dong's body.

456
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,429
Was there a clue
for the next murder?

457
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:39,400
No. There was no bait at all.

458
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,199
Are you sure you didn't fail
to find it?

459
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,429
Until now,
he only left intuitive clues...

460
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,630
so we could find the next victim
right away.

461
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:48,699
But, there wasn't anything
on Cho's corpse.

462
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,239
What's the point when he
already mentioned the little kid?

463
00:42:53,139 --> 00:42:54,210
What if it's a trick?

464
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,010
As Deputy Chief Lee said,
what if it's a red herring...

465
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,280
to steal our attention?

466
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,849
- Red what?
- Red herring.

467
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:01,949
Red herring.

468
00:43:02,719 --> 00:43:05,150
In the past,
criminals used red herring...

469
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:06,820
to get rid of their tails
since it smells so nasty.

470
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,730
It's bait to make naive hounds
like you turn the wrong way.

471
00:43:11,590 --> 00:43:13,159
How beautiful.

472
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,429
Don't you find it strange?

473
00:43:14,699 --> 00:43:16,829
Two people who lost their parents
to him are chasing him together.

474
00:43:16,829 --> 00:43:17,869
It's a strange coincidence.

475
00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:20,199
- Like you said, it's a coincidence.
- Of course, it is.

476
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,469
But only up to when we chose
to join the police.

477
00:43:22,539 --> 00:43:25,769
However, it's not a coincidence
we were lured into the same case.

478
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:27,179
That's obvious.

479
00:43:27,309 --> 00:43:29,710
He left clues on purpose
to lure us in.

480
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:33,380
But when we showed up,
he acted like he knew nothing.

481
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:34,849
I hope you can stop it.

482
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:37,320
- At the same time,
- The third murder...

483
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,989
he would explicitly act
like a psychopath.

484
00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:43,090
In the end,

485
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,429
he revealed his superpower.

486
00:43:46,929 --> 00:43:49,030
- Just get to the point.
- What do you think is his purpose?

487
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:52,030
What's his big picture
for luring the two of us in?

488
00:43:52,030 --> 00:43:53,099
Revenge. What else?

489
00:43:53,699 --> 00:43:55,840
- "Revenge"?
- What else could it be?

490
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:58,070
The Executioner's murders
were all based on revenge.

491
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:01,579
He punished those who deserved it
in place of the world.

492
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:02,909
That's why he exists.

493
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,150
It wasn't enough
that our parents died.

494
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,480
This huge game can't be explained
otherwise.

495
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:10,650
He's trying to make the kids pay
for the grudge from 20 years ago.

496
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,159
The three of our parents
were involved.

497
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:16,130
- "Three"?
- This includes Shim Sang Hwa.

498
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:18,829
Because her mother ran away
with another man?

499
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,760
It can't be a simple case
of blind love.

500
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,030
I'm sure there's a secret.

501
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:24,269
It could be the opposite.

502
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:27,500
He might be looking for an excuse
to avenge in order to murder.

503
00:44:28,769 --> 00:44:31,639
The Executioner has an excuse
to murder...

504
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,110
under the pretext that it's just.

505
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,380
Is that what you gained?
Is there no proper explanation...

506
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,849
for this enormous revenge?

507
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:42,119
What if the third target
isn't the boy?

508
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,550
Who is it, then?

509
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:48,090
What if...

510
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,360
it's me?

511
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,730
The rabbit hole is quiet.
Nothing significant to report.

512
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:31,699
I repeat. The rabbit hole is quiet.

513
00:45:31,769 --> 00:45:32,900
Roger.

514
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,170
- How about the GPS?
- It's working normally.

515
00:45:42,239 --> 00:45:43,750
All detectives on site,

516
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:47,179
act first and report later
according to the wolf's movements.

517
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,260
How many GPS trackers
did we install?

518
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,329
We have two each on the suspect's
car and the motorcycle.

519
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,070
- Is that enough?
- He could notice it with more.

520
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,440
I thought they were as big
as a fingernail.

521
00:46:08,469 --> 00:46:09,769
He's a hard match for us.

522
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,260
He connected us together
all this time.

523
00:46:30,929 --> 00:46:33,159
Then his target must be us.

524
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,869
I was in physical contact
with you too.

525
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,369
You don't have to look so worried.

526
00:46:43,539 --> 00:46:44,670
I'm not worried.

527
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:46,110
I'm just telling you it's possible.

528
00:46:46,739 --> 00:46:48,510
What I gained is something else.

529
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,579
So what was it?

530
00:46:51,550 --> 00:46:52,550
The accomplice.

531
00:46:53,150 --> 00:46:54,150
"The accomplice"?

532
00:47:04,090 --> 00:47:05,489
It's going to be a long night.
Thank you for your hard work.

533
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,769
- Keep up the good work.
- Yes, sir.

534
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:20,280
Get to work.

535
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:23,309
Put that up on the screen.

536
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:48,570
Hey. Darn it!

537
00:48:07,659 --> 00:48:08,889
It kept bugging me.

538
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:13,400
Why would such a meticulous guy
leave traces of the water pump?

539
00:48:14,130 --> 00:48:16,300
Maybe it was intentional.

540
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,800
Was the secret passage made
in order to hide his accomplice?

541
00:48:19,869 --> 00:48:20,969
Read my memory.

542
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:24,610
He showed you the secret passage
when you scanned him...

543
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:25,610
for the same reason.

544
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:27,210
So who is the accomplice?

545
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,340
That empty building used to belong
to a foreign corporation.

546
00:48:29,710 --> 00:48:31,510
It was
a multinational paper company.

547
00:48:31,579 --> 00:48:34,280
We hacked all the Chinese
government sites and found a lead.

548
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:37,349
A police officer was responsible
for hacking?

549
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:39,860
It wasn't for the investigation.

550
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:41,019
It was to save the kid.

551
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:42,920
So?

552
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:44,489
The person in charge of funding
that paper company...

553
00:48:44,489 --> 00:48:45,760
returned four years ago.

554
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:49,360
Shim Sang Hwa's husband?

555
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:51,670
Yoon Hee Tae.

556
00:48:52,969 --> 00:48:55,039
Her husband used her to...

557
00:48:58,239 --> 00:48:59,469
He's not the real dad.

558
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:02,110
Since he married Shim Sang Hwa,
who was a single mom.

559
00:49:04,309 --> 00:49:05,409
He didn't get on that plane.

560
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:08,050
He's probably near Jin Jae Gyu,
receiving orders from him.

561
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,320
Yoon Hee Tae committed murder too?

562
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:12,320
He's not just an ordinary guy.

563
00:49:13,059 --> 00:49:15,090
We even found connections
with him to criminal organizations.

564
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:18,329
Jin Jae Gyu is really targeting
that kid?

565
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:20,099
Due to blind love from 20 years ago?

566
00:49:21,159 --> 00:49:22,360
It's not something to overlook.

567
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:25,969
He'll make up any kind of excuse
for his sadistic pleasure.

568
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:28,369
So where are we headed right now?

569
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:30,769
Their hideout.

570
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:34,409
Jin Jae Gyu and Yoon Hee Tae's
real hideout.

571
00:49:47,190 --> 00:49:48,360
Don't worry.

572
00:49:49,590 --> 00:49:52,130
We dispatched the SWAT team
to look for him.

573
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:56,159
What is that sound?

574
00:49:56,829 --> 00:49:58,300
That's my husband's ring tone.

575
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:59,769
Did he leave his phone behind?

576
00:49:59,769 --> 00:50:01,400
No, I'm sure he took it.

577
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,539
Hold on.

578
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,110
(Unidentified Number)

579
00:50:09,539 --> 00:50:10,750
It's my husband's phone.

580
00:50:11,949 --> 00:50:14,380
(Unidentified Number)

581
00:50:15,349 --> 00:50:17,949
- Listen to me carefully.
- What is going on?

582
00:50:18,150 --> 00:50:21,360
- Honey, Hyun Soo is gone...
- Just listen.

583
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:23,559
- Are you with Hyun Soo?
- Come out through the back door.

584
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,659
- What?
- Run away now!

585
00:50:25,659 --> 00:50:28,099
Mr. Yoon. We're the police.

586
00:50:32,269 --> 00:50:33,400
Stay here.

587
00:51:11,969 --> 00:51:13,179
Where did the kid disappear?

588
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,980
Yoon Hee Tae owns dozens of
properties under borrowed names,

589
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:17,210
and they're all located
in secluded areas.

590
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:20,380
Since he disappeared here,
there's a high possibility.

591
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,150
- What about a warrant?
- What warrant?

592
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,349
Do it your style.

593
00:51:26,289 --> 00:51:28,320
- And take all the blame?
- You'll receive an extenuation.

594
00:51:28,659 --> 00:51:29,760
Since you know what you're doing.

595
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:36,099
You're even crazier than me.

596
00:51:37,429 --> 00:51:38,670
He climbed over a wall.

597
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:41,000
The secret passage was a trick.

598
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:42,769
He broke into their home.

599
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:44,739
Ms. Shim has been kidnapped.

600
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:48,079
Darn it. Seriously.

601
00:51:48,179 --> 00:51:50,380
Sir. My phone...

602
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:52,849
- What phone?
- My phone is in the car.

603
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:56,750
We have a signal on the phone.

604
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:58,280
It's moving fast towards Incheon.

605
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,500
He's running away.

606
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:19,099
Block all the airports and ports.

607
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:01,610
The kid isn't here.

608
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,750
Judging by his character,
there's probably another secret...

609
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:08,599
Let's go.

610
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:15,739
Open it.

611
00:57:12,269 --> 00:57:13,400
I didn't know you'd make it here.

612
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,110
Thanks to a high-tech world.

613
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:21,639
Turn around and get on your knees.

614
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:35,460
Don't touch him
when you handcuff him.

615
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,889
It'll take five minutes
for backup to arrive.

616
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:44,500
Getting rid of you two
and getting on a boat...

617
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,139
will take me only three minutes.

618
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:14,300
1 minute 50 seconds.

619
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,559
That's plenty of time.

620
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:18,300
You'll rot in jail
for the rest of your life.

621
00:58:25,809 --> 00:58:27,010
Jin Jae Gyu...

622
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:30,280
Jin Jae Gyu came to my house
and I ran away.

623
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:33,550
I went to the place
my husband told me to go to.

624
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:36,989
My son was inside the car.

625
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:42,159
He said we had to leave
this place immediately.

626
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,360
He told me
that's how we would be safe.

627
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:47,460
Ms. Shim. Where is your husband?

628
00:58:50,630 --> 00:58:52,570
We promised to meet
at the passenger terminal.

629
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:48,389
1 minute 30 seconds.

630
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:51,860
He has a knife!

631
01:00:14,219 --> 01:00:16,719
Hold on.
I'll call an ambulance.

632
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:40,440
You jerk!

633
01:00:49,619 --> 01:00:50,889
Were you planning on
killing a kid too?

634
01:00:59,460 --> 01:01:00,599
You failed.

635
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:02,960
The kid and his mom are both safe.

636
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:06,369
What?

637
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,539
We found them before
they left the country.

638
01:01:10,769 --> 01:01:11,840
What did you say?

639
01:01:13,809 --> 01:01:14,840
What?

640
01:01:16,210 --> 01:01:17,210
Are you disappointed?

641
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,550
No...

642
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:21,880
Wait... Wait.

643
01:01:22,349 --> 01:01:23,519
Something's not right.

644
01:01:23,989 --> 01:01:25,619
Something doesn't add up. Wait.

645
01:01:25,789 --> 01:01:26,820
Wait...

646
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:28,659
No.

647
01:01:35,130 --> 01:01:36,199
(Come back)

648
01:01:38,530 --> 01:01:40,900
No... No.

649
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,909
Remember...

650
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:47,409
you're the only one who can protect
Sang Hwa and Hyun Soo.

651
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,010
Never forget that.

652
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:00,460
Sang Hwa... Let Sang Hwa go.

653
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,889
Let Sang Hwa go.

654
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:08,059
He...

655
01:02:10,769 --> 01:02:11,869
wasn't trying to kill them.

656
01:02:14,469 --> 01:02:15,699
He was trying to protect them.

657
01:02:17,139 --> 01:02:18,369
Shim Sang Hwa's family.

658
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:22,380
From the real murderer.

659
01:02:23,309 --> 01:02:26,510
From... From the Eraser.

660
01:02:28,650 --> 01:02:29,750
Eraser?

661
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:01,920
No!

662
01:03:02,219 --> 01:03:04,190
No! No!

663
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:07,460
No!

664
01:03:48,929 --> 01:03:50,599
A group assault from 20 years ago.

665
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:52,730
Don't trust all of
Jin Jae Gyu's memories.

666
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:54,900
I'm sure that incident occurred.

667
01:03:55,469 --> 01:03:56,800
The real culprit is someone else?

668
01:03:58,809 --> 01:04:00,469
You don't trust my memory, do you?

669
01:04:00,710 --> 01:04:02,639
I'm certain he was near Jin Jae Gyu.

670
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:04,809
- Are you sure?
- A black face...

671
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,480
and red eyes.

672
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,019
He died due to choking.

673
01:04:08,019 --> 01:04:10,619
The moment Jin Jae Gyu's memory
began to get erased.

674
01:04:10,920 --> 01:04:12,690
The moment the murderer
first appeared.

675
01:04:13,150 --> 01:04:14,159
The survivor.
