(Truth and Sky Sanctuary)

5
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,549
I, Park Gi Dan,
the incarnation of the Lord...

6
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:53,630
holds the truth of
the divine universe in my hands...

7
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:54,829
and grants eternal life to
those disciples...

8
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:57,100
All four victims received the same
scholarship when they were 10.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,229
It's someone we all know.

11
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:01,600
Eternal life.

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,700
Park Gi Dan.

13
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:05,040
That infamous cult leader?

14
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:50,420
What are you doing?

15
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:54,819
It's you.

16
00:01:56,019 --> 00:01:57,659
It's Detective Superpower.

17
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:58,989
It's Det. Dong Baek.

18
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,329
- It's Det. Dong Baek.
- Det. Dong Baek.

19
00:02:02,359 --> 00:02:03,459
Let me go.

20
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:11,400
Don't do anything foolish.

21
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,370
Leave.

22
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,580
Right now.

23
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,219
Listen to me.

24
00:02:26,849 --> 00:02:28,550
I'll kill you.

25
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:29,650
This is an order.

26
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:34,860
How dare you do this...

27
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:37,129
in this sacred place?

28
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:40,569
- I apologize for this.
- That's not enough.

29
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,330
This is a sacred place.

30
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:44,500
I'm
Senior Superintendent Han Sun Mi.

31
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,669
I'll take him with me
and punish him.

32
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,240
You must've read...

33
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,080
my memory.

34
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,949
He's currently feeble-minded.

35
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,219
- He's not stable yet, so...
- Yes. I have.

36
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,520
You scumbag of a murderer.

37
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,449
- Det. Dong.
- What did you just say?

38
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,889
Have you gone crazy?

39
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,759
I'll get the police chief's number.

40
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,990
I knew it.

41
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,699
Superpowers...

42
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:15,530
are from the devil.

43
00:03:17,439 --> 00:03:18,569
"Devil"?

44
00:03:19,169 --> 00:03:20,310
Don't talk.

45
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,870
Have you ever thought...

46
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,110
that your superpower...

47
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,949
may be from the devil?

48
00:03:27,849 --> 00:03:29,180
That's how devils work.

49
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,050
They gift powers to those...

50
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,289
they're going to conquer.

51
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:41,330
You're right. I'm the very devil
who'll put you behind bars.

52
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:44,530
What are you doing?
Call the security and drag him out!

53
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,270
It's not too late.

54
00:03:59,979 --> 00:04:01,110
If you repent,

55
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,780
you can always be saved.

56
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,789
You want me to beat you to a pulp
in front of everyone?

57
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,830
Do you lack the courage to do that?

58
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:17,230
"Courage"?

59
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:23,269
Security! Security!

60
00:04:25,639 --> 00:04:26,670
You just wait.

61
00:04:27,769 --> 00:04:29,470
The fiery pits await you.

62
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:57,139
(Truth and Sky Sanctuary)

63
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,639
You fool.

64
00:05:02,339 --> 00:05:04,439
Do you know how foolish you are?

65
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,810
- I don't.
- He was...

66
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,550
the most powerful cult leader
in this country.

67
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,319
So? Is that why you were so polite?

68
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,519
I wanted him to be off his guard.

69
00:05:13,819 --> 00:05:15,720
I didn't want him to know that
he was a person of interest.

70
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,120
You came all the way here
yet didn't want him to find out?

71
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,259
I wanted him to feel nervous.

72
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,689
He'd only make mistakes...

73
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:22,660
while being both doubtful
and off his guard.

74
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:24,430
And you ruined everything.

75
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,029
What kind of detective
can't control his temper?

76
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,569
"What kind"?

77
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,269
Is that what you said?

78
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:41,480
I could kill him then and there.
However...

79
00:05:43,149 --> 00:05:44,279
However...

80
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,819
I didn't kill him because...

81
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,589
Search his villa first.

82
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,569
Why did you come here by yourself
without sharing any information?

83
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:06,639
You caused a scene again, right?
What did you do this time?

84
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:09,339
Hello, ma'am. What brings you here?

85
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:10,839
Is there a problem?

86
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,879
- We're running out of time.
- Shut it!

87
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,879
He's not always like that.

88
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:17,579
But I think his superpower
makes him act recklessly...

89
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:18,750
every now and then.

90
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,250
You'll be fine
after you get used to it.

91
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:21,420
Come on!

92
00:06:23,589 --> 00:06:25,160
I'll see you next time.

93
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,459
You lunatic.

94
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:30,430
You need to quit shouting at someone
who's as old as your dad.

95
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:47,949
The warrant?

96
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,879
The prosecutor refused to issue one.

97
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:51,220
Why?

98
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:54,449
He can't believe any of this.

99
00:06:54,689 --> 00:06:55,920
Any signs of pressure from outside?

100
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,860
No, I think he's just a coward.

101
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:09,600
- Where's the prosecutor?
- He's at a meeting.

102
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,600
He'll be coming out soon.

103
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,910
- Did you block the villa?
- Nothing in particular stands out.

104
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:15,910
A small minivan entered
in the morning.

105
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,810
- "A minivan"?
- They're helpers.

106
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:19,009
They're old ladies.

107
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:22,180
I'll fax the warrant
as soon as I get it, so be ready.

108
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,019
"Fax"? What if they demand
to see the original copy?

109
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:26,050
They're just old ladies.
Just do it.

110
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,560
What's the reason?

111
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:32,160
What did I tell you?

112
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,860
You lacked evidence.

113
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:36,660
- There's more than enough.
- Do your job properly.

114
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:39,800
If the prosecutor says no,
you should comply...

115
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,970
and look for more evidence.

116
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,129
Don't be ridiculous.

117
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,370
Why would we do a search
and seizure if there's a proof?

118
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,639
We'd request an arrest warrant.

119
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,800
Let's be honest here.

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,639
Do you know how many elites
pay Park Gi Dan during the holidays?

121
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,040
Hundreds of presidents
of the court...

122
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,040
and superior authorities.

123
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,579
Then we should arrest him
for accepting bribery.

124
00:07:56,149 --> 00:07:59,350
Why are you so afraid of that cult?

125
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,250
"Cult"? Listen to me.

126
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,490
It doesn't matter if they're a cult.

127
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,160
That only matters
to those who are religious.

128
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,529
- Then what's important?
- Power.

129
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:09,959
Power stems from money.

130
00:08:09,959 --> 00:08:12,199
And Park Gi Dan is the wealthiest.

131
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:14,569
Why does that matter
when we're catching a murderer?

132
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:16,100
If that's what you think,
then I can't help you.

133
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,170
This is exactly why
you can't work with women.

134
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,839
Are you really not going
to issue a warrant?

135
00:08:23,069 --> 00:08:25,410
I said, no. Seriously.

136
00:08:28,649 --> 00:08:29,750
What is it?

137
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,819
You should hurry over.

138
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:33,320
What's wrong?

139
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:37,049
There is
a search and seizure warrant.

140
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,220
(Search and Seizure Warrant,
Suspect: Park Gi Dan)

141
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,159
What?

142
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,769
(Episode 4: Double-edged Sword)

143
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:53,070
(3 hours ago)

144
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,279
What are you going to do
about Dong Baek's arrest...

145
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,480
getting dismissed
and our receiving humiliation?

146
00:09:02,649 --> 00:09:05,720
Well, juridically speaking,

147
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,590
it's not our fault.

148
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,389
But the Northern District
Prosecutor's Office...

149
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,220
We could revise it
and make another request.

150
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:17,659
And you call yourselves prosecutors?
Do you?

151
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,970
And you call me an old hag, right?

152
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:26,100
If only you knew
how much heat I was getting...

153
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:27,909
If you saw me...

154
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,889
- Why are you here?
- To make a request.

155
00:09:44,889 --> 00:09:45,990
You want me to be easy on you?

156
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,490
Come on, you're not a kid.

157
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,889
That's not it.
I'll admit to the charges.

158
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,360
Then do you want to negotiate
your sentence?

159
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:54,169
No, that'll stay the same.

160
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:56,830
- Why?
- But I have a condition.

161
00:09:59,639 --> 00:10:00,740
"A condition"?

162
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:08,309
Have you gone insane?

163
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:10,580
You want to attack Park Gi Dan
without any evidence?

164
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,019
I read his memory,
and he killed someone.

165
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,289
So what? If you didn't scan him
with his written consent,

166
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,960
that won't get you the warrant.

167
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,460
There's enough
circumstantial evidence,

168
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,399
and the RIU has already
requested a warrant.

169
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,830
This has nothing to do
with my scanning.

170
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,669
Is that so? Then Central District
Prosecutor's Office can issue it.

171
00:10:30,669 --> 00:10:33,100
The prosecutor in charge
had kneeled before Gi Dan.

172
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,870
I hold the truth of
the divine universe in my hands...

173
00:10:36,139 --> 00:10:37,509
He's a scholarship student of his.

174
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,309
RIU will never be able to get
a warrant...

175
00:10:39,509 --> 00:10:41,350
especially from Central District
Prosecutor's Office.

176
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:47,179
All right, let's say
that we issue a warrant.

177
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,220
How are you sure
that it won't be dismissed?

178
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,860
Judge Song Seung Pil
of Western District Court.

179
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,590
He's a lunatic who only punishes
those who are powerful.

180
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,690
He's as crazy as I am.

181
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:57,230
Everyone knows that.

182
00:10:58,629 --> 00:11:00,100
We just need to search
his study at his villa.

183
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,799
He's journaled all of his murders.

184
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,769
Once he's incarcerated,
I'll admit to my charges.

185
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:11,240
But why should I get involved?

186
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:15,409
Don't all prosecutors
love the spotlight?

187
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:18,620
Of course, there's a risk.

188
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,990
If he finds out,
then your career will be over.

189
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,289
- On the other hand,
- Yes?

190
00:11:22,289 --> 00:11:23,620
you'll become a nationwide star...

191
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:26,159
if you put him behind bars
for murder.

192
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:32,960
High risk, high return?

193
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:38,070
We'll carry out
a search and seizure.

194
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:39,570
Who's the owner of the villa?

195
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,139
He's not here.

196
00:11:42,139 --> 00:11:44,340
According to
the Criminal Procedure Code,

197
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,309
we will carry out
a search and seizure...

198
00:11:46,309 --> 00:11:48,350
- of the suspect,
- Is he stupid or what?

199
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:49,809
- Park Gi Dan's villa...
- They're all detectives.

200
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,649
due to suspicions of murder
and incitation of murder.

201
00:11:51,649 --> 00:11:52,919
We will also search...

202
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:55,549
the residents
and the building manager's bodies.

203
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,059
- Hey, they're detectives.
- What?

204
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:16,840
Det. Choi.

205
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,549
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

206
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,720
This way.

207
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,470
This is the prosecution. Open up.

208
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,840
Open up. This is the prosecution.

209
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,620
Who's in there?

210
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,049
The helper. She's an old lady.

211
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,899
There they are.

212
00:13:20,769 --> 00:13:21,840
Go.

213
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,639
"You must give prior notice
and show the warrant beforehand."

214
00:13:57,779 --> 00:13:59,809
Article 118
of the Criminal Procedure Code.

215
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,149
"However, there is an exception
during an exigency."

216
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:04,679
Supreme court's precedents.

217
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:06,519
Open up this instance.

218
00:14:14,929 --> 00:14:15,960
Ma'am.

219
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:20,460
Ma'am?

220
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,120
They have trouble hearing.

221
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,350
They're old, after all.

222
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:53,000
What is this smell?

223
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,970
Chemicals.

224
00:14:56,269 --> 00:14:58,299
- Paint.
- "Paint"?

225
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:08,850
- Has there always been smoke?
- "Smoke"?

226
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,649
- What smoke is that?
- Darn it.

227
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,250
They're burning the evidence.
Stop them!

228
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:16,490
All right.

229
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:18,919
Okay.

230
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,159
They're getting rid of evidence.

231
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:22,389
They've incinerated everything.

232
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,490
Open up this instance.

233
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,399
- Go in.
- Yes, sir.

234
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,100
Hurry up.

235
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,149
- Go over there. Go on.
- Yes, sir.

236
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,679
- You two, follow me.
- Yes, sir.

237
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,750
Go to the study first.

238
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,649
What is this?

239
00:15:50,889 --> 00:15:54,190
Please remember that whatever
you obtain illegally...

240
00:15:54,889 --> 00:15:56,090
won't be acknowledged
as evidence.

241
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:07,200
Ma'am.

242
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:51,009
Darn it. Let me go.

243
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:52,980
If you get involved, they'll say
it's an illegal investigation.

244
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,320
That scumbag.

245
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,529
There are only ashes.

246
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,849
So many of you came.

247
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,789
Excuse the messiness.
I'm redesigning the interior.

248
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:32,289
I heard you're from Western District
Prosecutor's Office.

249
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,660
I'm Chief Prosecutor Yeo Ji Sook.

250
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:43,000
I didn't know chief prosecutors
did field work.

251
00:17:44,839 --> 00:17:46,200
This is unprecedented.

252
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:51,880
You must be very interested
in investigations.

253
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,109
You're in a dilemma, aren't you?

254
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,480
Whether to admit your mistakes
and apologize...

255
00:17:58,650 --> 00:18:02,450
or continue to be deceived
and act hostile toward me.

256
00:18:03,089 --> 00:18:04,720
You have quite the imagination.

257
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:08,460
But then again, isn't that how
you become religious?

258
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:13,759
I heard the police investigation
will end soon.

259
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,670
You have good sources.

260
00:18:18,569 --> 00:18:22,069
The Lord is omnipresent.

261
00:18:23,509 --> 00:18:26,710
Then you wouldn't be lonely
in solitary confinement.

262
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:28,950
It's best you don't speak with them.

263
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,049
I must open my heart
to non-believers.

264
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:38,660
The reason why I'm going this far...

265
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:42,059
is because
I want to give you wisdom.

266
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,559
The wisdom to repent.

267
00:18:46,759 --> 00:18:49,529
There's even a man who forgave
his betrayer three times.

268
00:18:50,369 --> 00:18:52,200
I should do that much as well.

269
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:57,880
How about this?

270
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,609
If you admit your mistakes
and apologize,

271
00:19:03,779 --> 00:19:07,119
I won't ask you to be responsible
for anything.

272
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,359
Are you taunting
the governmental authority?

273
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,390
Are you insulted?

274
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,859
Humiliation comes...

275
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:21,700
from your guilty conscience.

276
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,339
Then I'll give you a chance as well.

277
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,809
A chance to turn yourself in
and die as a human.

278
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:39,650
That was...

279
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:42,819
the second mistake you've made.

280
00:19:43,549 --> 00:19:45,589
- Don't make this more difficult.
- "Difficult"?

281
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,690
You'll find out
what's truly difficult...

282
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:52,160
when you're locked up
in solitary confinement.

283
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,799
How dare you?
Lawyer Park, sue them all.

284
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,170
Courage...

285
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,809
can only be obtained
when you're with the Lord.

286
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:06,279
You're not being courageous.

287
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:10,109
You're just being stubborn
and ignorant.

288
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,450
Sneer all you like.

289
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:16,619
You'll be suffering from now on.

290
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,430
Ma'am?

291
00:20:29,329 --> 00:20:30,329
Pull out.

292
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,700
What should we do now?

293
00:21:03,099 --> 00:21:05,400
If the snake is trying
to go back into its pit,

294
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,140
we'll use a stick
to poke it back out.

295
00:21:14,109 --> 00:21:16,450
Reporter Kang.

296
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:18,220
Somehow...

297
00:21:18,619 --> 00:21:21,650
I was reminded of your face first.

298
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:24,519
Do you like exclusive news?

299
00:21:25,359 --> 00:21:27,359
Of course it's a big exclusive.

300
00:21:27,859 --> 00:21:29,490
Enough to turn over the world.

301
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,599
(Chief Prosecutor Yeo Ji Sook)

302
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:38,369
Why did you come to see me?

303
00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:40,200
I heard Special Investigation Team
disbanded.

304
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,839
I came to see you personally.

305
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,769
Please summon Park Gi Dan.

306
00:21:43,869 --> 00:21:45,779
- Do you think he'll be charged?
- You saw it yourself.

307
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,980
He's the real criminal.

308
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:49,279
Why did the sly man do that?

309
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,880
Of course everything
was a part of his plan.

310
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:52,650
He thinks we can't do anything
to him.

311
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:55,650
- But he's wrong.
- The case was already closed.

312
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,220
Please, ma'am.

313
00:21:57,349 --> 00:22:00,559
It's my last day
as the chief prosecutor.

314
00:22:01,490 --> 00:22:03,589
This is what I get for putting
all my money on Mr. Superpower.

315
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,759
Are you going to kneel
in front of a murderer?

316
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:08,769
Do you know what the most
disgusting thing is as a prosecutor?

317
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:11,539
When you know it's garbage,
but you're helpless.

318
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,170
There are truckloads of garbage
I had to let go.

319
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:17,009
I never gave up.

320
00:22:17,009 --> 00:22:18,809
I made sure to throw out
every piece of garbage I saw!

321
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,210
I wish you luck.

322
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,089
The prosecution should be punished!

323
00:22:30,089 --> 00:22:32,819
- Go away!
- Go away!

324
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:34,960
The prosecution should step back!

325
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,390
- Step back!
- Step back!

326
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:40,160
- He's innocent!
- He's innocent!

327
00:22:50,839 --> 00:22:52,009
Go away!

328
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,579
You should be punished!

329
00:22:58,849 --> 00:23:01,650
The prosecution should be punished!

330
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,259
(Evil prosecution is fabricating
a crime no one remembers!)

331
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:14,430
(On public duty)

332
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,339
I understand.

333
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,140
Yes. Yes.

334
00:23:26,609 --> 00:23:27,740
- Okay.
- Yes.

335
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:30,880
The decision is taking quite long.

336
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,380
We have to be prudent.

337
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,920
Well, we came here
since we trust you.

338
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:36,650
I'm sure they'll say yes.

339
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,289
No one would say no
to such a huge exclusive.

340
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,859
That murderer should become
the headline on the news.

341
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:43,230
The news won't be enough.

342
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:46,160
It needs to be an hour long
current affairs show to have hope.

343
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,529
The current affairs bureau
can work on it as well.

344
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:49,730
We were given the order.

345
00:23:51,269 --> 00:23:53,900
- We'll start researching...
- "Start"?

346
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,210
We have to research first
before deciding to air it.

347
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:57,470
It's for the better.

348
00:23:57,569 --> 00:24:00,279
You should dig everything about him
including who's protecting him.

349
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,180
But we need to have grounds
before we start.

350
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,549
"Grounds"?

351
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:07,150
Baek already read
his memories of killing.

352
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,450
You already know that they are
trying to stop Det. Dong...

353
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,049
from memory scanning.

354
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,789
The press is the worst.

355
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:18,130
We can't say that we're researching
based on memory scanning.

356
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,700
What kind of grounds do we need?

357
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,299
Evidence or a witness.

358
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:23,529
Aside from Det. Dong.

359
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:25,269
Why would we need the press
if we had those?

360
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:26,400
He'd be arrested already.

361
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,799
You must be scared.

362
00:24:29,569 --> 00:24:31,009
You need insurance in case
something bad happens,

363
00:24:31,009 --> 00:24:32,839
but you want to keep the exclusive.

364
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:35,809
You must not know,

365
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,619
but all of us put our lives at risk
while writing our stories.

366
00:24:38,819 --> 00:24:40,079
So did anyone die from it?

367
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:41,819
- While publishing articles?
- Hey.

368
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:45,559
Let's go.

369
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,089
Det. Dong.

370
00:24:49,329 --> 00:24:52,700
We gave it to them on a plate,
but they're too scared to eat it.

371
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,269
They're too scared of that snake,
Park Gi Dan.

372
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,240
- Baek.
- It'll be the same elsewhere.

373
00:25:00,569 --> 00:25:04,369
No press would dare to barge in
on Park Gi Dan without evidence.

374
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,450
Baek! Baek!

375
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,680
We're in trouble.

376
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:20,119
This morning, the members
of the Judiciary Committee...

377
00:25:20,119 --> 00:25:23,759
have agreed to hold
a legislative hearing...

378
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:26,930
and summoned Det. Dong Baek
to attend the hearing.

379
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:30,430
Of course we should seek
his advice on the enactment.

380
00:25:30,869 --> 00:25:32,470
We're not trying to humiliate him.

381
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,400
We just want to hear
from his perspective.

382
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,269
What if I run into him
by coincidence,

383
00:25:36,269 --> 00:25:39,180
and he reads my faults
from childhood and arrests me?

384
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:44,480
Excuse me! Please change our grill.

385
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:46,150
(Witness Attendance Request)

386
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,619
They're trying to humiliate you.

387
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:51,660
The hearing will be broadcasted
live, like a people's court.

388
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,859
You don't have to go.

389
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:58,089
Their summons doesn't force him
to attend,

390
00:25:58,259 --> 00:26:00,529
but if he doesn't go,

391
00:26:00,529 --> 00:26:02,670
the press won't sit still.
They'll make a story out of it.

392
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:09,910
We're not talking about you.
You've always been...

393
00:26:10,509 --> 00:26:13,009
- on our side.
- Of course.

394
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:19,480
It's Park Gi Dan's doing.

395
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:21,250
He's scared that the memories
you read...

396
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,049
might be considered lawful evidence.

397
00:26:23,049 --> 00:26:24,450
He's trying to block
all possibilities.

398
00:26:28,089 --> 00:26:29,130
You should resign.

399
00:26:29,289 --> 00:26:30,630
Captain Koo.

400
00:26:31,329 --> 00:26:34,799
If this law passes
and memory scanning becomes illegal,

401
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,000
he won't be able to investigate
using his superpower.

402
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,069
Dong Baek.

403
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,440
Go join the NIS or a conglomerate...

404
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,680
who'd pay you millions
and treat you like a human.

405
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:51,779
This job is hurting you
physically and mentally.

406
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,490
Even if you struggle
to catch criminals,

407
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:00,160
all you get in return is hatred.
You should just quit.

408
00:27:05,130 --> 00:27:06,900
Even if I get fired,

409
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,900
I'll cut off the head
of that snake before I go.

410
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,440
Hey! Senior Superintendent Han.

411
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,339
Come and join us.

412
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:27,720
That's when Baek and me...

413
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,349
Then he came.

414
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:31,049
It was so funny.

415
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,019
Did you give up on Park Gi Dan?

416
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,559
Of course not.

417
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:38,529
You're having a team dinner
even before catching the criminal.

418
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,359
Did you transfer
to the inspection team?

419
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,430
Please share Park Gi Dan's memories
with me.

420
00:27:44,099 --> 00:27:46,940
I'll find the evidence of murder
from within it.

421
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,769
All evidence was in that villa.
It's all in ashes now.

422
00:28:00,619 --> 00:28:02,289
Instead of evidence
from his memories,

423
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,650
we'll find evidence
that's absent from his memories.

424
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:09,430
Murder evidence he wasn't aware of.

425
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:18,470
(Regional Investigation Unit Team 3)

426
00:28:22,769 --> 00:28:24,109
A journalist can't come in here.

427
00:28:24,109 --> 00:28:26,279
I won't write about it.
If I can help with anything...

428
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:35,549
What a cold gust of wind.

429
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,119
It's better to have more people
on our side.

430
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:46,160
Murder evidence was burned.

431
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,029
But, not everything was burned.

432
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:53,970
Whatever burned in the fire
is what Park Gi Dan remembers.

433
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:57,769
Is there evidence
he doesn't remember somewhere?

434
00:28:58,579 --> 00:29:00,240
This is too vague.

435
00:29:00,339 --> 00:29:03,950
First, we'll list
the memories Det. Dong saw.

436
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:07,250
After that, we'll find...

437
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,819
gaps in between.

438
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,089
I couldn't read everything.

439
00:29:14,589 --> 00:29:16,660
I only got to see the last
two murders due to the time limit.

440
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,960
Should we start
with Kim Seo Kyeong's murder?

441
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,470
Preparing and cleaning up murders...

442
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,430
Please, don't kill me.

443
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:26,500
Please let me go.

444
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,869
were Han Man Pyung's job.

445
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:34,210
Park Gi Dan had a phobia
against exposing his DNA.

446
00:29:34,779 --> 00:29:36,349
He'd dress in layers.

447
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:40,019
He'd preach before a murder.

448
00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:44,990
He rationalized his evil doings...

449
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:48,589
- to Han Man Pyung...
- You'll be purified.

450
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,789
and to himself.

451
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:54,130
How long did it take
from his sermon to the murder?

452
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:10,349
Do you need a break?

453
00:30:12,349 --> 00:30:13,480
One hour for Kim Seo Kyeong.

454
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,150
Just over 10 minutes
for Yoon Ye Rim.

455
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:19,259
He was chased for time...

456
00:30:20,089 --> 00:30:21,319
because I got in.

457
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,500
He combined his desires
to kill and sexual desires...

458
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,299
for optimal pleasure.

459
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:34,539
How did he clean up afterwards?

460
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:36,940
He put the condom in his surgical
gloves and took it away.

461
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:54,619
By the way,

462
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,190
if he was so meticulous
with destroying evidence,

463
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,559
why was he so careless
with the bodies?

464
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,799
To show off.

465
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:02,430
"Show off"?

466
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:09,269
It was a sign to announce
the establishment of his kingdom.

467
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:14,609
He'd make it with the corpses.
He was planning to kill 13 people.

468
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:18,309
That piece of garbage.
I should just go shoot him now.

469
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,779
Why did he throw Kim Seo Kyeong away
when she was alive?

470
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:23,619
If he wanted her to survive...

471
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,460
I left my gun at the office.

472
00:31:34,430 --> 00:31:36,230
Don't discard it
where it's too remote.

473
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:40,339
It won't be fun
if they discover her too late.

474
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,430
It was Han Man Pyung
who kept her alive.

475
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,329
Park Gi Dan only found out later.

476
00:32:09,170 --> 00:32:11,670
Do psychopaths have feelings too?

477
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,940
Not Han Man Pyung.

478
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,799
If an ignorant person...

479
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,109
has belief...

480
00:32:17,170 --> 00:32:19,140
He thought the victim
would be saved...

481
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,779
because she was punished
by Park Gi Dan.

482
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:33,089
Please review the summary.

483
00:32:33,289 --> 00:32:36,359
Det. Dong and I will add
the fine details.

484
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,059
Anything to keep in mind?

485
00:32:38,329 --> 00:32:40,029
Review it without prejudice.

486
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,869
Read it from a new perspective.

487
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,430
Not from my views
or Det. Dong's views.

488
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,500
It's kind of like
spotting the difference.

489
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,109
Look for something that seems off.
That will be the start.

490
00:32:49,170 --> 00:32:51,309
I'm an expert at doing that.

491
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,440
I'll show you how amazing
a veteran's gut feelings are.

492
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:58,079
Park Gi Dan. Here.

493
00:32:58,819 --> 00:33:01,450
What is this all of a sudden?
I see, it says "die".

494
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,920
Then again...

495
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,960
- Park Gi Dan.
- Look at this.

496
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,359
This should be referenced.

497
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,170
It happened at 9pm.

498
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,329
No, 9:54pm.

499
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,339
(Moving line in Daegyung-myeon)

500
00:33:28,009 --> 00:33:34,579
(Kim Seo Kyeong, Yoon Ye Rim)

501
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:01,640
Are you done organizing?

502
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,579
Should we stop here?

503
00:34:08,579 --> 00:34:09,889
It's okay to keep on going.

504
00:34:11,489 --> 00:34:13,860
We can group together later
with clearer heads.

505
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,489
Wake up Old Man.

506
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,730
Baek, did you forget this one?

507
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,070
The latex gloves from the fireplace.

508
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:32,340
- What gloves?
- After killing Seo Kyeong,

509
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,639
he burned 13 items
in the fireplace...

510
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:36,510
including his training suit
to his backpack.

511
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,849
And?

512
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,820
But when he killed Ye Rim,
there were only 12 items.

513
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,219
The gloves are missing.

514
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:45,690
The latex gloves with the condom.

515
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,630
Maybe he burned it
and you just forgot to list it.

516
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,190
Gloves...

517
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,429
Wait. They weren't there
when he started the fire.

518
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,969
Then where are they?

519
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:03,039
What if he dropped them?

520
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,579
I'm sure Han Man Pyung
got rid of it a long time ago.

521
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:08,039
What if it's stuck somewhere?

522
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:11,050
Perhaps in a gap between the floors,

523
00:35:11,309 --> 00:35:12,820
or maybe in a drain hole.

524
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,420
It's worth checking.

525
00:35:14,750 --> 00:35:16,320
The game would be over
as long as we find it.

526
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,650
His semen will be there,
as well as Ye Rim's DNA.

527
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,889
Let's go.

528
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:22,590
Right now?

529
00:35:22,659 --> 00:35:24,090
Wake up Captain Koo
and gather the forensics team.

530
00:35:24,829 --> 00:35:26,699
- How many?
- All of them!

531
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:28,159
I'm sorry.

532
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:30,530
Good morning.

533
00:35:52,889 --> 00:35:54,460
From where Han Man Pyung fell off?

534
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,630
No, from the murder location.

535
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:17,949
There's something there.

536
00:36:23,789 --> 00:36:26,389
It looks like latex gloves.

537
00:36:33,429 --> 00:36:35,429
- It's too short.
- The forensics team can get it out.

538
00:36:41,869 --> 00:36:44,239
Go more in. Keep going.

539
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:48,239
Move forward. Go.

540
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,949
Keep going. More.

541
00:36:50,949 --> 00:36:51,980
What are you doing?

542
00:36:53,849 --> 00:36:55,989
- Who are you?
- Who allowed you in here?

543
00:36:56,289 --> 00:36:57,289
This is private property.

544
00:36:58,489 --> 00:36:59,989
This is a crime scene.
What are you doing?

545
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,889
I'm the owner's
legal representative.

546
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:03,929
How can you represent him
when he died?

547
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,599
He left a will.

548
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:08,730
All of his wealth was succeeded
by a client of our law firm.

549
00:37:08,860 --> 00:37:09,869
Who?

550
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,530
Go and check the register
if you want.

551
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:13,340
What are you doing? Get to work.

552
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:15,610
Okay. Move forward. Keep going.

553
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:16,739
What are you doing?

554
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:18,909
Can't you see?

555
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:21,409
The foundation is too weak,
so we're pouring concrete in.

556
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,909
- Hurry up.
- Keep going. Go forward.

557
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,010
This is a murder scene.

558
00:37:25,309 --> 00:37:27,019
If you damage the evidence,
I'll arrest all of you.

559
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,519
Do you have a warrant?

560
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,489
Of course you don't.
You're on suspension.

561
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:39,329
I'm from the RIU. If you don't
step back, I'll arrest you.

562
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,929
The Special Investigation Team
already disbanded.

563
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,170
Do as you please.

564
00:37:48,269 --> 00:37:49,610
Park Gi Dan sent you, didn't he?

565
00:37:55,179 --> 00:37:57,780
There he is. The one in charge.

566
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:21,869
Why are you here?

567
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,369
Is it our first time meeting?

568
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,110
(Hwang and Ahn Law Firm,
Attorney Lim Joong Yeon)

569
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:34,349
"Attorney"?

570
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:39,019
Thanks to you, I started
my new job as an attorney.

571
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:41,320
Why are you an attorney
when you should be in jail?

572
00:38:42,019 --> 00:38:43,630
I'm not guilty until proven.
Don't you know that?

573
00:38:43,929 --> 00:38:46,300
There are three years until
the Supreme Court...

574
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,599
makes a decision.

575
00:38:47,929 --> 00:38:51,300
I should live hard until then.

576
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:54,000
You jerk!
Ye Rim died because of you!

577
00:38:54,369 --> 00:38:57,809
You're committing contempt
and defamation.

578
00:38:57,809 --> 00:38:59,409
I'll kill you.

579
00:38:59,409 --> 00:39:00,809
Now you're blackmailing.

580
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:02,909
It's a serious offence to destroy
a scene of a crime!

581
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:06,280
No one applied for this site
to be preserved.

582
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:09,789
In an emergency, a detective has
the right to confiscate evidence.

583
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:10,949
Step back right now.

584
00:39:10,949 --> 00:39:12,420
Bring me a warrant first.

585
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:14,619
Or, you can file a lawsuit.

586
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,690
Let go. All of you will be charged.

587
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,860
You trespassed first.

588
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:22,829
What are you doing? Take them out.

589
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:24,099
- Let go!
- Jerk!

590
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:25,300
Jerk.

591
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,670
- Let go.
- Hurry up.

592
00:39:26,869 --> 00:39:28,039
Good, good.

593
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,739
Just start.

594
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:31,610
Let go.

595
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:38,050
- Let go!
- Good, good.

596
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,750
No.

597
00:39:57,099 --> 00:39:59,099
No!

598
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:00,300
No!

599
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:21,690
It is such an honor...

600
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:22,860
for me to serve you.

601
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:26,360
Everything comes with a cost.

602
00:40:27,699 --> 00:40:30,369
How much do you need to proceed?

603
00:40:30,829 --> 00:40:32,400
Five as a deposit...

604
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,869
and another five
as a contingency fee.

605
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:40,710
- Do you mean 500,000?
- 5 million.

606
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:46,119
That's more than I expected.

607
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,849
Even for a figure like you.

608
00:40:50,989 --> 00:40:52,690
You must not be aware of the price.

609
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,389
You're being charged for murder.

610
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,829
Are you going to save
all that money...

611
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:00,800
to use it in the afterlife?

612
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:06,440
I thought you weren't fond
of money.

613
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:09,769
When you have nowhere else
to go higher up,

614
00:41:09,969 --> 00:41:11,440
there's just one thing left
in the end.

615
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,739
Leave this up to me,

616
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:16,280
and you'll be granted
your eternal life for sure.

617
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:23,489
The best criminal suit lawyer ever?

618
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:28,690
Let's agree at nine million.

619
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,230
Consider one million as a tithe.

620
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:33,929
- Eternal life.
- Eternal life.

621
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:47,980
Mom.

622
00:41:56,489 --> 00:41:57,789
Dong Baek, calm down.

623
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,659
Captain Koo brought you here.

624
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:12,369
How long was I out?

625
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:14,639
Three hours?

626
00:42:16,769 --> 00:42:17,940
But why is it dark outside?

627
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:22,039
You woke up and fainted again.

628
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,280
You don't remember?

629
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,420
You woke up and walked around.

630
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:30,320
What...

631
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,389
(National Medical Center)

632
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:54,840
- What happened after?
- You were found an hour later...

633
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:57,349
in a staircase, in a total daze.

634
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,289
It's nothing to worry about.

635
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,889
What are you doing?

636
00:43:06,889 --> 00:43:08,960
It was probably because of
a concussion, but I'm okay now.

637
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,789
It's not that simple.

638
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:12,960
You lost consciousness before too
while you were scanning memory.

639
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,329
I'm sure there's a problem.

640
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:17,070
You must not read more memories
until we find the cause.

641
00:43:17,269 --> 00:43:18,630
- I need to go.
- Dong Baek.

642
00:43:19,769 --> 00:43:21,940
- Where are you going?
- What happened?

643
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,769
They covered everything up
with concrete.

644
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:26,440
I'm sorry. We were too late.

645
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:36,150
Those security guards even wounded
their own bodies so you can't sue.

646
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:37,820
Stating they were assaulted by you.

647
00:43:37,889 --> 00:43:39,989
I'm going to kill all of them...

648
00:43:39,989 --> 00:43:41,889
- Can you talk about work later?
- Yes, ma'am.

649
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:51,829
Senior Superintendent Han. Wait!

650
00:43:58,369 --> 00:44:01,139
Give me full authority.
I'll catch Park Gi Dan.

651
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:09,280
What do you think the job
of the police is?

652
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,619
Crushing evil people?

653
00:44:12,789 --> 00:44:15,119
We need to destroy them
with all our might.

654
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,289
That's why it's so difficult
for you.

655
00:44:17,659 --> 00:44:18,829
You'll fall ill.

656
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,630
Because you can't take it whenever
you see a bad guy.

657
00:44:22,969 --> 00:44:27,440
What the police do is
to maintain a certain balance.

658
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,809
The appropriate balance
between good and evil.

659
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:33,139
That's how we don't fall ill.

660
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,079
Park Gi Dan.

661
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:39,949
He cannot kill anyone now.

662
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:42,280
You've done it.

663
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:45,289
You managed to tilt the balance
to the good side.

664
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,920
I know you want to destroy him.

665
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:49,559
But...

666
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,429
now isn't the time.

667
00:44:55,329 --> 00:44:57,429
We need time...

668
00:44:58,199 --> 00:44:59,400
in order to destroy that scumbag.

669
00:45:01,739 --> 00:45:04,840
- Do you understand?
- No, I don't.

670
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,380
I'm certain of what the police
should do.

671
00:45:07,809 --> 00:45:10,309
They need to handcuff the murderers
and throw them into court!

672
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:12,710
Is that so difficult?

673
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:15,639
They're calling it a hearing,
but it's literally a witch trial.

674
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,349
Their goal is to insult you
rather than reveal the truth.

675
00:46:18,750 --> 00:46:21,579
Listen carefully to
what he's telling you.

676
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:24,190
You know what
you have to say, right?

677
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:26,559
That you won't scan
people's memories rashly...

678
00:46:26,889 --> 00:46:28,719
and you'll accept any kind
of punishment.

679
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:32,690
- If I don't say that?
- Stop that already!

680
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:36,400
They're going to use this as
justification to pass the law...

681
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,099
prohibiting memory scanning.

682
00:46:38,199 --> 00:46:40,539
You have to beg desperately
in order to receive leniency.

683
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:43,940
What if you give them an attitude
and you're sentenced to jail?

684
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,510
Do you want your career
as a detective to end?

685
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:47,539
Use this crisis as an opportunity.

686
00:46:48,679 --> 00:46:50,449
Use this opportunity meant to
humiliate you...

687
00:46:50,449 --> 00:46:51,809
to turn the tables around.

688
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,150
There's no need to think.
Just remember all you have to do...

689
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:58,650
is beg to those higher-ups
and make them feel assured.

690
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,260
Got it?

691
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:09,429
First of all, I'd like to point out
something to the witness.

692
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:12,170
You've been indicted...

693
00:47:12,570 --> 00:47:13,800
for assaulting the suspects
successively, right?

694
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,199
(Witness Stand)

695
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,210
Yes.

696
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:18,369
How did you determine
they were the suspects?

697
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:22,980
You took an oath to tell
the truth only.

698
00:47:24,849 --> 00:47:27,250
You read his memory
without his consent, correct?

699
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,389
Yes.

700
00:47:31,519 --> 00:47:33,460
I believe scanning people's memories
without a warrant...

701
00:47:33,460 --> 00:47:34,960
is even worse than
illegal wiretapping...

702
00:47:35,090 --> 00:47:37,460
and is a serious felony.
Do you agree?

703
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,289
Yes.

704
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:41,530
Goodness, we have no way
to protect our privacy.

705
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,230
How could the police
do something like this?

706
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:45,369
Does he even know what I had
for dinner last night?

707
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:48,769
Will you continue to accuse people
as criminals...

708
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:50,039
without a warrant?

709
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:54,409
No.

710
00:47:55,179 --> 00:47:56,280
Are you sure?

711
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:58,550
(Hearing for Det. Dong regarding
Memory Scanning Prohibition Law)

712
00:48:03,889 --> 00:48:06,590
Yes, I'm sure.
I'll stop starting tomorrow.

713
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:10,360
Wait. What? "Starting tomorrow"?

714
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,929
Is that a joke? What does he mean?

715
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:16,630
Yes, starting tomorrow.

716
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,369
Wait, not starting today?

717
00:48:20,369 --> 00:48:21,739
What is he saying?

718
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:23,409
I have something to do.

719
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:26,239
What are you doing?

720
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:29,710
I know the real culprit of
the Claw Hammer Serial Murder Case.

721
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,710
Sir, ask him to stop talking.

722
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:34,920
The culprit chose beautiful girls
for scholarships...

723
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,719
and years later, made an excuse
that they were corrupt...

724
00:48:37,719 --> 00:48:39,320
and made Han Man Pyung
kidnap them.

725
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,320
Stop talking immediately!

726
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,619
He said his body was
the path to salvation...

727
00:48:43,429 --> 00:48:44,989
and raped them brutally.

728
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:48,829
- The whole nation is watching.
- And in the end,

729
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:51,769
he struck down on them
with a claw hammer.

730
00:48:51,769 --> 00:48:52,800
Stop!

731
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,800
Numerous times,
until they ceased to breathe.

732
00:48:56,269 --> 00:48:57,340
Take him away!

733
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:02,539
He was a psychopath who
disguised his perverted desires...

734
00:49:02,539 --> 00:49:04,579
as the Lord's punishment.

735
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,349
His name is...

736
00:49:07,449 --> 00:49:08,750
- Dong Baek.
- Shut your mouth!

737
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:11,920
The moment you say that name,
you'll go to prison.

738
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,559
Slander, insult, and leaking
details of an investigation.

739
00:49:14,659 --> 00:49:16,730
You'll receive at least 5,
no, 10 years!

740
00:49:17,090 --> 00:49:18,829
- His name is...
- This hearing is adjourned.

741
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:22,159
Park Gi Dan.

742
00:49:27,139 --> 00:49:28,500
What is going on?

743
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:31,039
The famous cult leader
that you all know!

744
00:49:31,710 --> 00:49:32,739
Park Gi Dan.

745
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:34,239
What are you talking about?

746
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:35,809
- Take him away!
- Nonsense!

747
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:43,719
Take him away!

748
00:49:44,019 --> 00:49:45,420
Everybody, calm down!

749
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:46,860
Make way!

750
00:49:47,219 --> 00:49:49,119
- Wait!
- Say something!

751
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:51,329
He really pulled out...

752
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,360
the double-edged sword.

753
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:55,559
Darn it.

754
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:00,039
If the law was enforced properly,

755
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:02,400
this incident wouldn't have occurred
in the first place.

756
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,239
What do you mean by law enforcement?

757
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:07,280
That wicked and violent detective
should've been arrested.

758
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:10,079
What Det. Dong did
cannot be forgiven.

759
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:12,309
He revealed illegal information
similar to wiretapping...

760
00:50:12,309 --> 00:50:14,949
during a live hearing as he pleased.

761
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:17,550
This is a crime against humanity...

762
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,719
that goes against the foundations
of a civilized country.

763
00:50:19,719 --> 00:50:22,920
We inform you that the opinions
of the panel members...

764
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,260
are not in line with our station's
official position.

765
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:33,199
Yes, that's correct.

766
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:35,469
No, that's not true.

767
00:50:35,570 --> 00:50:38,269
We don't know if Det. Dong's
sudden exposure is true.

768
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:40,809
- We're trying to figure it out.
- I'm afraid we have to check...

769
00:50:40,809 --> 00:50:43,409
with Det. Dong. We're trying
to confirm the facts right now.

770
00:50:43,409 --> 00:50:45,079
- No.
- How would we know?

771
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:47,320
We're checking too.
Let's talk later.

772
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,989
What are you doing here?
Go meet Det. Dong.

773
00:50:49,989 --> 00:50:52,590
- What is going on?
- The public is outraged.

774
00:50:52,590 --> 00:50:54,090
They're bombarding us
with complaints.

775
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:56,659
Hello? Yes, we're checking it
right now.

776
00:50:56,659 --> 00:50:58,289
- Can you please wait?
- That's not true.

777
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,130
No, it's...

778
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:02,099
He will face civil and criminal
lawsuits.

779
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:04,869
Secondly, despite the elders
trying to stop him,

780
00:51:04,869 --> 00:51:06,869
Mr. Park has decided...

781
00:51:06,869 --> 00:51:09,340
to step down from
his position briefly...

782
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,639
and continue to serve the Lord
as a commoner.

783
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:14,840
And he had an earnest request
for the people.

784
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:18,980
He asked for everyone to pray...

785
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,320
for the poor soul of Det. Dong Baek.

786
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:32,590
Det. Dong Baek has been known
to live in a hotel usually,

787
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:36,130
but he has moved into his villa
that you see behind me...

788
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:37,170
and isolated himself totally.

789
00:51:37,730 --> 00:51:39,599
Meanwhile, a petition has been
posted on the Blue House...

790
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,769
bulletin board system, asking for
Park Gi Dan's punishment,

791
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:45,039
and it's showing an unprecedented
rate of participation...

792
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:47,480
with more than three million people
agreeing within a few hours.

793
00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:49,809
The prosecution was planning on
issuing...

794
00:51:49,809 --> 00:51:51,750
an arrest warrant for Det. Dong
this morning,

795
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:52,780
but they've currently ceased
all activities,

796
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:55,519
perhaps because of the explosive
reaction...

797
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:58,090
from the whole nation.

798
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:06,500
Yes.

799
00:52:06,829 --> 00:52:07,860
Are you okay?

800
00:52:11,699 --> 00:52:12,800
Thank you.

801
00:52:14,769 --> 00:52:15,869
For what?

802
00:52:16,909 --> 00:52:20,780
Thanks to you, we got the warrant.

803
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:25,849
I'm going to dig up
the buried evidence.

804
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:34,260
Do you think it's possible?

805
00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:36,119
It's a 99 percent possibility.

806
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,789
I'll secure the evidence
as long as there's no mistake.

807
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:42,059
No, not that.

808
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:46,500
Will it be accepted as legal proof?

809
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,269
With Park Gi Dan's DNA,
it's common sense for...

810
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:52,010
Is this even a country
where common sense prevails?

811
00:52:53,539 --> 00:52:54,710
And what about the court?

812
00:52:56,949 --> 00:52:58,179
Are you the Det. Dong I know?

813
00:53:00,179 --> 00:53:02,449
The person I knew was
the gutsiest man in the world.

814
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:09,260
Get some rest.
I'll take it from here.

815
00:53:20,269 --> 00:53:22,639
Move in. Let's move in!

816
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:23,639
Let's go.

817
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:42,219
Det. Dong. Det. Dong!

818
00:53:42,619 --> 00:53:43,860
It's Min Sung Han.

819
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,489
Det. Dong!

820
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:48,630
Det. Dong!

821
00:54:02,579 --> 00:54:03,909
He came out!

822
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:05,679
(You are the only one, Dong Baek!)

823
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:10,250
Move aside!

824
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:17,559
Wait, stop the car!

825
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,530
Where are we going?

826
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,170
You'll know when we get there.

827
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:28,869
What a mess.

828
00:55:25,789 --> 00:55:26,829
What?

829
00:55:30,730 --> 00:55:31,969
He was murdered early this morning.

830
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:53,150
There's something you must do.

831
00:55:56,389 --> 00:55:57,789
Read their memories?

832
00:55:57,829 --> 00:56:01,159
The followers who were with him
don't remember anything.

833
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,030
When Park Gi Dan was beaten
to death.

834
00:56:04,670 --> 00:56:06,170
Are you trying to get rid of me
for good?

835
00:56:06,269 --> 00:56:07,900
I'm on the verge of being arrested.

836
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,139
It's an official request.

837
00:56:09,469 --> 00:56:11,239
We received their written consent
as well.

838
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:14,239
There are so many witnesses.
Why do you need...

839
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,449
There's nothing...

840
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:31,820
in their memories.

841
00:57:36,989 --> 00:57:38,789
It's as if the memory of
Park Gi Dan's death...

842
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:43,000
has been cut out
from their memories...

843
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:49,869
with a razor blade.

844
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:22,739
Doesn't it feel like the culprit
is declaring war?

845
00:58:22,869 --> 00:58:24,369
A crime using superpower?

846
00:58:24,369 --> 00:58:26,739
How interesting. There's another
person with a superpower like me.

847
00:58:26,909 --> 00:58:29,510
You have become a key suspect
as of this moment.

848
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:32,050
That file has never been
revealed to the world.

849
00:58:33,179 --> 00:58:35,780
When Det. Dong was admitted,
he disappeared for a while, right?

850
00:58:36,349 --> 00:58:37,650
This is absurd.

851
00:58:38,119 --> 00:58:40,360
The rooftops. He can go anywhere...

852
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,690
while avoiding the security cameras.

853
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:44,159
Don't you think it's a trap?

854
00:58:44,329 --> 00:58:46,789
Let's wait and see.
If I get swallowed up...

855
00:58:46,789 --> 00:58:48,329
or if I'll burn the witch to death.
