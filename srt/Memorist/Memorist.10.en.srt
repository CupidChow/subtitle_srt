5
00:00:57,630 --> 00:00:58,759
The Eraser.

6
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:01,929
He was right below us.

7
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:06,299
He needs to make
physical contact too.

8
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,840
In order to take over one's memory.

9
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,540
Police. Don't move!

10
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:46,540
These aren't blanks.
Raise your hands!

11
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,240
Wait!

12
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,840
- Wait.
- What are you doing?

13
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,250
Just a minute.

14
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,439
Yoon Hee Tae.

15
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:08,259
His memories were erased.

16
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,000
All of it.

17
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,300
He doesn't remember his name...

18
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:18,000
He can't even speak.
He erased everything.

19
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,479
We believe this tunnel
has been made...

20
00:03:27,479 --> 00:03:28,750
around the same time
20 years ago.

21
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,580
We're searching it thoroughly
in case we find anything else.

22
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,219
- You may not enter.
- I'm his wife.

23
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,289
You need permission.

24
00:03:41,289 --> 00:03:42,430
- I'm her wife!
- Thank you.

25
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,930
- You still need permission.
- Don't be ridiculous!

26
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:45,030
Wait.

27
00:03:46,699 --> 00:03:47,830
You may go inside.

28
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,740
Sir.

29
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,500
It's okay.

30
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:55,169
Sir, you're at a hospital.

31
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,469
You're safe.

32
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,580
Hee Tae.

33
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,550
It's me.

34
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:54,399
He'll be able to regain
his cognitive abilities soon.

35
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,800
After all, his brain wasn't damaged.

36
00:04:57,069 --> 00:04:59,740
I don't think so.
His memories have been wiped out.

37
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,339
What do you mean?

38
00:05:01,339 --> 00:05:02,569
Someone erased...

39
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,209
all the memories in his lifetime.

40
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,250
If there's a memory scanner,
there's bound to be a memory eraser.

41
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:14,790
Please keep this on the down low...

42
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,620
until we arrest the serial killer.

43
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,920
"Serial killer"?

44
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,860
How is it possible to erase
someone's entire memory?

45
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,470
I know it's hard to believe,
but it did happen.

46
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,980
He left a message.

47
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:43,720
What?

48
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,180
He left it
in Hee Tae's subconscious.

49
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,129
"It's not over."

50
00:05:55,829 --> 00:05:58,459
"It'll be the third death
of someone you've touched."

51
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:01,629
"Someone will die
before the moon sets."

52
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,740
"They will be
the third cursed offering."

53
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:09,170
He's warning us of another killing?

54
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,209
His sadistic game...

55
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:13,379
is not over.

56
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,779
We have...

57
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,050
three days left.

58
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,750
No. I won't play defense anymore.

59
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,649
That's exactly what he wants.

60
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:22,790
But guess what?

61
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,889
I'm done playing with his games now.

62
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:26,959
What are you planning to do?

63
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,360
I'm going to set a trap.

64
00:06:28,829 --> 00:06:30,259
And it'll be...

65
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:32,430
a feisty one.

66
00:06:37,699 --> 00:06:41,269
(Episode 10: Trauma Trigger)

67
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:43,470
(Step 1: Casting)

68
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,180
It's been a week
since the unprecedented murder...

69
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,949
of the director of the press.

70
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:54,990
However, it seems like
the police are still unfazed.

71
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,819
Their embargo had sparked
the killing spree.

72
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:01,490
And up to this moment,
they refuse to be transparent.

73
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,600
Three days ago, they had announced
the arrest of Jin, the suspect.

74
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:06,459
But due to the lack of evidence...

75
00:07:10,769 --> 00:07:11,870
What's your plan?

76
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,810
We're considering
sharing the information.

77
00:07:14,769 --> 00:07:16,040
For the time being,

78
00:07:16,509 --> 00:07:18,410
don't release any information about
how the killer has a superpower.

79
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,110
Why not?

80
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,680
The public found out about
Baek's superpower all of a sudden.

81
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:25,750
But the higher-ups believe
it should be different this time.

82
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:27,389
Is that what the NIS wants?

83
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:30,790
No, the situation there
is already hectic as is.

84
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,959
Then who was it?

85
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:34,889
The man on the top.

86
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,069
Be discreet. I want him alive.

87
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,740
Get to him before the NIS does.

88
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:48,810
I have a favor, sir.

89
00:07:53,009 --> 00:07:54,779
I need Det. Dong's help.

90
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,050
He's not officially on our team,
so we will take all the credit.

91
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,750
Nevertheless, he'll be found guilty
and kicked out.

92
00:08:03,089 --> 00:08:05,089
- Why do you need him?
- The killer erases memories.

93
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,620
If we want to catch him,

94
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,529
we'll need a hound who possesses
a superpower as well.

95
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,300
So you want to use him
and then dispose of him?

96
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,240
I thought you two were
on the same team.

97
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,670
My only goal is to solve this case.

98
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:24,939
- Is that so?
- I'd also like a promotion...

99
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:26,980
for both Chief Byun and me.

100
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:31,079
Hey, why would you ask me
for a promotion...

101
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,679
Because you desire...

102
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,350
to reach a higher position than
the chief of police and need us.

103
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:41,860
So you'd like to side with me?

104
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,029
You too?

105
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:50,200
Loyalty is important, indeed.

106
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:53,139
But I value competence more.

107
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:56,139
That's why I always cleaned
after you two.

108
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,639
So go get him.

109
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:01,110
Unleash your hound
or use him as bait.

110
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,809
Just bring the killer
in front of me.

111
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,929
- Ms. Han.
- Yes?

112
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:18,830
You've made two mistakes today.

113
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,700
I'm sorry
I couldn't tell you in advance.

114
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,669
No, there's a more serious mistake.

115
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,309
You offered your loyalty to him.

116
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:32,480
I only did so to gain what I wanted.

117
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:34,879
- It didn't mean anything.
- That's exactly it.

118
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,450
That's your true mistake.

119
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,950
Everyone knows
you're addicted to solving cases.

120
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:41,919
Of course, you'd like
to receive a promotion as well.

121
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:43,450
That's only natural.

122
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,990
But the more promotions,
the less field work.

123
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,730
Look at me.

124
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:52,730
I'm sure you're aware of that.

125
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,830
And yet, you swore your loyalty
just for a promotion?

126
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,570
And he actually bought that?

127
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,669
Don't you think...

128
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,740
that's a bit odd?

129
00:10:03,539 --> 00:10:06,639
From now on,
he'll become more suspicious...

130
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,009
of your true intentions.

131
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,360

My body aches thanks to you.

137
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,090
It's wonderful to be young.

138
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,559
You must be such a scaredy-cat...

139
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:56,460
to have dug two underground paths.

140
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,299
Did I?

141
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:02,799
I'm sorry I can't remember.

142
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,139
Let's join hands.

143
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:09,909
I need your help.

144
00:11:11,509 --> 00:11:13,509
Did Sang Ah and her son go abroad?

145
00:11:14,149 --> 00:11:15,379
She didn't want to do that.

146
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,649
Just send them away.

147
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,889
You need to avenge Yoon Hee Tae.

148
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,419
That has nothing to do with me.

149
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,690
Stop pretending to be coldhearted.

150
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:34,600
We found him.

151
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,440
He's alive,
but he's like a newborn baby.

152

It can kill 10 elephants.

156

Why?

158

He'll only tell us
where the money is if he's starving.

I'm avenging my brother.

167
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,100
You fool.

168
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,269
I know everyone in the black market.

169
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,669
You bought sugar.

170
00:15:40,679 --> 00:15:42,379
This is the real cyanide.

171
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:46,549
What's your brother's name?

172
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,360
It doesn't matter.

173
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:53,220
He's going to die anyway.

174
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:22,450
- Get him.
- Let me go!

175
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:25,059
Gosh!

176
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,059
You!

177
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,299
Who are you?

178
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:15,940
It doesn't matter.

179
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,309
You're going to die anyway.

180
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,809
I'm sorry.

181
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,720
But anyone who has seen my face
needs to die.

182
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,890
It doesn't matter.

183
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:10,930
I already got my revenge.

184
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,839
What's your name?

185
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,009
Hee Tae.

186
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:24,369
Yoon Hee Tae.

187
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:28,450
Mr. Yoon. Mr. Yoon?

188
00:18:30,779 --> 00:18:31,950
That's enough.

189
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,240
Is it true?

190
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,579
Det. Dong told me.

191
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:37,279
He said Mom was going
to kill me as well.

192
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,559
What do you mean?

193
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:50,289
I heard you killed her to save me.

194
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:58,200
A killer doesn't need
a reason to kill.

195
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:02,769
Your mom was a good woman.

196
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,880
That's why I wanted to kill her
even more.

197
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,240
Why is he acting that way?

198
00:20:36,009 --> 00:20:37,869
- You'll know once you have kids.
- What?

199
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:40,339
He doesn't want her to know
her mom's true face.

200
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:41,710
That's paternal love.

201
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,349
But they're not related.

202
00:20:44,349 --> 00:20:46,720
That's human nature.

203
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,650
Shouldn't we take them
somewhere safe?

204
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:52,519
The killer isn't
after Hee Tae's family.

205
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:54,890
Then?

206
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,299
Hello, I'm done my casting.

207
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,369
- And the result?
- We'll have to wait and see...

208
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:06,440
if Jae Gyu takes the bait.

209
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:13,640
Let's begin step two.

210
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:18,250
- Where should we begin?
- Verify our friends and foes.

211
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,579
"Our friends and foes"?

212
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,119
Verify everyone's alibis...

213
00:21:21,349 --> 00:21:23,220
during the time the Eraser
was in the sewer.

214
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,990
I don't know where to begin.

215
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:27,789
Let's start with home ground.
The Special Investigation Team.

216
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,960
The detectives?

217
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,759
There's no way
a detective would be...

218
00:21:30,759 --> 00:21:32,299
We're eliminating all uncertainties.

219
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,700
In order to catch him,

220
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,569
we're going to find out
who are friends are.

221
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,799
No exceptions.

222
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,599
Should we start with us?

223
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:41,369
I've already done that.

224
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:47,480
Your alibis checked out.

225
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,579
Cross-check everyone's alibis
during that time.

226
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:52,819
Go on.

227
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:56,190
Yes, ma'am.
Check the detectives' locations.

228
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,220
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

229
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,170
What happened
to Dong Baek's scandals?

230
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,569
Well...

231
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:16,710
We couldn't get him to meet with us.

232
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,539
Are you joking? Can a reporter say
they can't write a story...

233
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,150
because their subject
won't meet with them?

234
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,849
Don't you know how things have been
since Mr. Cho passed away?

235
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,650
Since you mentioned that,

236
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,559
why are we following an order
from someone who died?

237
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,829
How dare you talk back to her?
You should know your place.

238
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,900
- Ji Eun.
- Yes?

239
00:22:41,029 --> 00:22:42,170
Remember this.

240
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,369
What we're doing isn't a means...

241
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,400
to follow the intention
of the deceased.

242
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,799
The honor of the media is at stake.

243
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:49,369
We must break Dong Baek.

244
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,180
Why is that?

245
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,480
- What harm did he do?
- If you don't know that,

246
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:57,549
you don't deserve to sit here.

247
00:22:59,119 --> 00:23:00,579
Bring me something in 48 hours.

248
00:23:01,049 --> 00:23:03,920
It better throw Dong Baek
into the sewer.

249
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:12,960
Hello, Reporter Kang.

250
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:17,269
How did you know...

251
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:19,069
Baek started working here
starting today?

252
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
- What do you mean?
- Didn't you know?

253
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,569
Well, it's not official.

254
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,410
This is off the record,

255
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
but they really need Baek
for this case...

256
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,809
since we're dealing with
a special criminal.

257
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,680
Should I call him for you?

258
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,119
No, I came to see you.

259
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,589
- Me?
- Yes.

260
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:38,289
I want to hear what Det. Dong...

261
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,220
is really like
from the people around him.

262
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:44,589
Are you giving us support
before his trial?

263
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,200
You're so nice.

264
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:49,029
What should I talk about?
Something good, I guess.

265
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:54,039
I'd like to know how you really feel
without any exaggeration.

266
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,809
For example,
do you ever feel hatred...

267
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,279
towards Det. Dong?

268
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:00,710
Of course, I do. Every day.

269
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,380
"Every day"?

270
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,079
I get mad at him 12 times a day.

271
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:06,049
Has it been three years
since I met him?

272
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:07,980
My head was full of hair back then.

273
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,250
But look at me now.

274
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,990
Ever since I met him,
my hair falls out in chunks.

275
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,329
What do you hate about him the most?

276
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:18,500
Everything. He only does things
that make me mad.

277
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:21,529
Is it because of his personality?

278
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:23,369
He was always crazy,

279
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:26,500
but it's because he's greedy.

280
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,710
"Greedy"?

281
00:24:29,269 --> 00:24:30,609
He's greedy
about catching criminals.

282
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:36,509
Baek isn't interested
in getting promotions.

283
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,880
His eyes are set on catching
the criminals.

284
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,619
Rumor has it that
he's doing it for popularity.

285
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,559
Some people laugh at him.

286
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:50,190
Sure. Baek tends to think
he's a celebrity.

287
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,099
But it's because...

288
00:24:54,029 --> 00:24:55,900
he can sympathize.

289
00:24:56,569 --> 00:24:57,930
What do you mean?

290
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,299
He can directly feel the pains
of the victims.

291
00:25:01,769 --> 00:25:03,309
Whenever he reads their memories,

292
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:06,009
he can feel every single thing.

293
00:25:06,779 --> 00:25:09,250
Pain, rage, and the rest of it.

294
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,349
He doesn't beat others
so he could become popular.

295
00:25:13,779 --> 00:25:16,619
He throws his fists because
he feels wronged like the victims.

296
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:18,559
He tries to hold it in,

297
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,619
but the moment
he sees the criminal's face,

298
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:21,930
his body moves automatically.

299
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:24,630
Just like Pavlov's dogs.

300
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:28,130
He's like a dog that drools
whenever the bell rings.

301
00:25:30,069 --> 00:25:32,599
"First of all, I would like..."

302
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:35,809
"to apologize for my bad manners..."

303
00:25:36,609 --> 00:25:41,009
"when I first
joined the RIU two years ago."

304
00:25:45,019 --> 00:25:47,519
"Of... Of course,"

305
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:54,119
"a few words won't be enough
to ask your forgiveness..."

306
00:25:54,819 --> 00:25:58,500
- "about everything I've done."
- His acting is so bad.

307
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,970
Why does he have
such a bad internal reputation?

308
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:05,269
Well, it's partially because
he's crazy,

309
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,299
but it's really because he makes
everyone feel down.

310
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:09,569
Why is that?

311
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:12,309
Baek gets
all the special promotions.

312
00:26:12,579 --> 00:26:16,710
Since people complained so much,
he ended up moving to our division.

313
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,619
We'd only use him as the last resort
in secret.

314
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:21,619
It was jealousy, then.

315
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:24,150
It would be okay if he was nice
to other people.

316
00:26:24,289 --> 00:26:25,920
But that wouldn't be Baek
if he was nice.

317
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:28,529
For example, when he tries
to read the memories...

318
00:26:28,529 --> 00:26:30,289
of female victims who experienced
brutal crimes,

319
00:26:30,430 --> 00:26:31,759
his blood would boil.

320
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:33,930
He would treat his seniors badly
for failing to reduce the damage.

321
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:35,099
Who would like him?

322
00:26:35,329 --> 00:26:38,539
"If you would accept me
as your teammate again..."

323
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:40,470
Are you reading from a script?

324
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,640
"A script"?

325
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,339
What is he doing?

326
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,779
"I won't embarrass you..."

327
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:52,150
Hey, what is that in your hand?

328
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,119
"I promise to participate..."

329
00:26:54,119 --> 00:26:56,490
- "in the investigations..."
- He's cheating on his apology.

330
00:26:58,190 --> 00:26:59,559
- Det. Oh.
- Yes?

331
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,890
- Was it you?
- No.

332
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,089
No?

333
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:06,529
No wonder.
Of course, he hasn't changed.

334
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:09,029
A fool can never throw away
his bad habits.

335
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:18,009
But I can't hate him.

336
00:27:18,069 --> 00:27:20,039
His heart bleeds as he catches
the criminals,

337
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,309
but all the media
only want to bring him down.

338
00:27:22,309 --> 00:27:23,849
What can I do? At least
I should be nice to him.

339
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:28,079
Why do you think the media
is treating him that way?

340
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,660
I'm too stupid to know,

341
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,019
but it's one or the other.

342
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:38,059
One group feels sorry for the people
who were jailed because of Baek,

343
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:41,400
while the other fight
for the assailants' human rights.

344
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:43,529
I ended up finding out...

345
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,099
that the media lives on top
of the pyramid too.

346
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:51,539
They won't allow those below them
to even squirm.

347
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,950
But we're thankful for reporters
like you.

348
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,410
You always work hard for us.

349
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,690
Although he gets on my nerves
all day,

350
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,690
my hatred towards him disappears
when I get off work.

351
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,859
My youngest
is still in elementary school.

352
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,630
Gosh, it's embarrassing to tell you.

353
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,460
Anyway, he waits for me
past his bedtime...

354
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,059
so he could hear about
Uncle Baek's heroic stories.

355
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,230
He loves
to boast about it at school.

356
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,170
He says Baek is Captain Korea,

357
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,240
and since I'm Baek's boss,
I'm like Nick Fury.

358
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,839
I better not turn bald like him.

359
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,880
What do you think will happen
with the current case?

360
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,480
He might not look like
he's all there,

361
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,819
but he's a professional with cases.

362
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,950
He feels a sense of duty
especially with this one,

363
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:41,829
so although it's been difficult
for him, I'm sure he'll resolve it.

364
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:48,970
Let go!

365
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:56,039
- Hold him.
- Let go.

366
00:28:58,109 --> 00:28:59,210
Move it.

367
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,410
What are you doing?

368
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,750
What do you think you're doing?

369
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:16,890
- You little...
- Darn it.

370
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,369
Is this a part of your plan?

371
00:29:30,509 --> 00:29:32,880
Of course, it is.

372
00:29:33,779 --> 00:29:35,650
This was the second step
in figuring out friends and foes.

373
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,380
I scanned everyone without alibis.

374
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,150
What did you gain?

375
00:29:41,519 --> 00:29:44,990
None. At least we won't have to
suspect the detectives.

376
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:46,119
Are you 100 percent sure?

377
00:29:46,819 --> 00:29:49,130
Why? Do you think
I couldn't recognize the Eraser...

378
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:50,289
and allowed him to fool me?

379
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:52,759
He can touch someone's heel
and make them see hallucinations.

380
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,400
You can't scan people like him.

381
00:29:55,970 --> 00:29:57,200
What a good talker.

382
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,839
- The truth always hurts.
- Sure.

383
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:03,309
I'm certain he's nearby.

384
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:06,140
Close enough to sneak out
investigation information.

385
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:09,210
That's why I acted foolishly
for them to get confused.

386
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:11,549
I doubt that was an act.

387
00:30:11,650 --> 00:30:12,849
Are you joking?

388
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:17,349
Have you come to a conclusion
about the next possible victim?

389
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:22,460
If we pick the wrong target,
my plan will fall through.

390
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,859
I'm the one
who drew the big picture.

391
00:30:24,089 --> 00:30:26,359
But I'm the one who actualized
your vague idea.

392
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,630
Fine. You're the best.

393
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,269
So? What's your conclusion?

394
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,910
What do you mean
he'll kill one of us?

395
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,380
He warned he'd kill,

396
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,380
saying he wants to make me suffer.

397
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:43,950
Will they kill someone
just to bother you?

398
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:47,349
Then it won't be me.

399
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:49,289
Baek looks down on me all the time.

400
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:51,420
I was scared for a moment.

401
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:53,190
I'll give you two options.

402
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,529
"Options"?

403
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:58,529
One, take refuge abroad right away.

404
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,900
Is it because the Eraser
can't leave the country?

405
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:04,170
Isn't that just an assumption?

406
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,940
They knew Jin Jae Gyu's address
abroad, but they never went to him.

407
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,640
I think it's possible.

408
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,039
Why didn't you tell me?

409
00:31:10,039 --> 00:31:13,210
You have zero consideration.

410
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:15,180
Let's look into some flight options.

411
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:17,380
What's the second option?

412
00:31:17,509 --> 00:31:19,250
- Hey.
- Hooking the Eraser.

413
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,819
I'm sick of playing defense.

414
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:23,750
It's you I'm sick of.

415
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,660
- I'll do it.
- Do what?

416
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,000
- What do I have to do?
- Hey!

417
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,509
This camera
will send footage in real-time.

418
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:52,349
The moment the Eraser shows himself,
everyone will find out.

419
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:55,349
Yes, but that would be after
he dies heroically on the job.

420
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,589
Old Man, you should hurry
to the airport.

421
00:31:58,289 --> 00:31:59,390
Okay.

422
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:01,759
I won't protect you if you
get attacked on your way.

423
00:32:01,859 --> 00:32:03,630
Did you hear him?

424
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,799
He wouldn't blink an eye
even if I die because of him.

425
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,700
Then you wouldn't be
a target anyway.

426
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:19,410
We'll use you as a bait
to set a trap.

427
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:22,180
It'll be...

428
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,079
very dangerous.

429
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,420
Not anyone can be a partner
of someone with a superpower.

430
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,920
I promise you...

431
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,829
you'll have the strongest backup
we can provide.

432
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:41,730
Let's try it.

433
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,369
It'll be a real war.

434
00:32:50,339 --> 00:32:52,779
Darn it.

435
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:06,019
(Step three. D-day:
lure him with a bait)

436
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,019
Delta 1. Delta 1.
Receive Omega's message.

437
00:33:41,359 --> 00:33:43,759
- What is this about?
- The SWAT team has to go.

438
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:45,859
Who says?

439
00:33:45,859 --> 00:33:47,230
Someone reported the possibility
of a terror attack...

440
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:48,630
at the summit
being held on Jeju Island.

441
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:51,230
The full SWAT team was ordered
to dispatch right away.

442
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:53,299
Leave half of your men here.

443
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:54,640
Everyone was ordered to dispatch.

444
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,940
I'm sorry,
but we'll have to leave now.

445
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:00,740
Call the headquarters.

446
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:01,880
This order came from the NSC,

447
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,950
so the headquarters
won't have power...

448
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,009
Pull out!

449
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,519
Where are you going?

450
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:08,480
Hey!

451
00:34:12,789 --> 00:34:14,289
(National Medical Center)

452
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,559
Field teams,
get into the emergency formation.

453
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,329
Teams 3 to 12 must stay
in close proximity.

454
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,610
Let's go.

455
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,159
That psychopath...

456
00:35:24,389 --> 00:35:26,559
(Court of Korea)

457
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:50,849
Move out of the way. Move.

458
00:35:50,849 --> 00:35:53,289
- Please look this way.
- Move!

459
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:55,219
- Move.
- What are you doing?

460
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:57,030
- Move!
- How do you feel right now?

461
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,590
I'm sorry.

462
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,829
- Why did you kill?
- Over here.

463
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:01,929
Hurry.

464
00:36:01,929 --> 00:36:03,230
How did you come to murder?

465
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,769
Please say something.

466
00:36:04,769 --> 00:36:06,099
Move out of the way!

467
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:07,199
Excuse me.

468
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:09,139
How do you feel right now?

469
00:36:09,139 --> 00:36:11,239
Please move out of the way.

470
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,110
Do you believe it was just?

471
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:15,239
Please tell us how you feel.

472
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:16,909
Please say something.

473
00:36:16,949 --> 00:36:19,150
What are your last words?

474
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,880
Move out of the way!

475
00:36:23,289 --> 00:36:25,019
Do you have any comments?

476
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:26,659
Step back.

477
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:42,869
(Judge)

478
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,510
(Defendant)

479
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,320
- Defense counsel.
- Yes?

480
00:36:54,519 --> 00:36:57,690
Do you admit to the fact
written on the warrant?

481
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,559
Of course not.

482
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,289
Mr. Jin Jae Gyu has nothing
to do with the murders...

483
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:05,699
from this year, nor the case
from 20 years ago.

484
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:08,969
Then what about this?

485
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:24,380
Didn't you talk
with the defendant before...

486
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,050
attending the investigation
to determine a warrant's validity?

487
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:32,860
This shouldn't be valid.

488
00:37:33,289 --> 00:37:35,389
His attorney wasn't in attendance.

489
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:36,829
- Also,
- He even signed...

490
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,800
to confirm that he killed
those people 20 years ago.

491
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:46,139
At the moment,

492
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:50,309
the defendant's mental
and physical state are not stable.

493
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,210
I'll submit the record to show...

494
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,139
he was hospitalized
for 15 years at a mental institute.

495
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,019
(Judge)

496
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:09,190
What are you doing? Sit down.

497
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:15,159
(Judge)

498
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,329
What is this?

499
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,900
I'm completely fine.

500
00:38:21,769 --> 00:38:23,869
Your Honor,
Prosecution is claiming...

501
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:27,139
that the defendant's slip of tongue
right after his surgery...

502
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:28,909
is his confession.

503
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,780
I'm not crazy.

504
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,949
Please keep in consideration
that the defendant...

505
00:38:34,949 --> 00:38:37,219
has a mental problem
which won't allow him...

506
00:38:37,219 --> 00:38:39,489
I said I'm not crazy!

507
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,559
(Judge)

508
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,360
What's the matter with you?

509
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:49,369
If I get another chance to kill,

510
00:38:50,329 --> 00:38:51,900
I'll kill you.

511
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:56,070
What did you say?

512
00:38:58,269 --> 00:38:59,780
I said...

513
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,579
I'll kill you.

514
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:04,610
Let go...

515
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,480
Hey, calm down.

516
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,920
Please don't kill me.

517
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:38,050
Jin, who was under an investigation
to determine...

518
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:40,750
a warrant's validity
for the executor's murder case,

519
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:44,090
is said to have injured himself
in court.

520
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:47,590
Jin was bleeding excessively,
so he is now getting...

521
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,260
an emergency operation.

522
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,710
Meanwhile, the court says
the security at the time...

523
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:05,409
was under the unprecedented
management of the police.

524
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:07,610
It's assumed
there will be controversy...

525
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:08,679
in determining who's responsible.

526
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,380
Where's Senior Superintendent Han?

527
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:12,719
We can't figure out her location.

528
00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:14,619
Hey, Byun Young Soo.

529
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,590
What's wrong with you?

530
00:40:17,250 --> 00:40:19,090
The court should be under
the Department of Justice.

531
00:40:19,389 --> 00:40:21,820
Why did you go in there
for us to get the blame?

532
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:31,130
They say the worst is over.

533
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:33,239
Wake up! We didn't even start!

534
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,570
Senior Superintendent Han,
I'm getting a call from above.

535
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:41,039
We'll make arrangements
to restrict the whole floor.

536
00:40:41,239 --> 00:40:42,309
"The whole floor"?

537
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:44,909
It's a big hospital, so it's hard
to empty even a single room.

538
00:40:44,949 --> 00:40:46,380
How can we secure the whole floor?

539
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,719
We'll go up to the VIP wing
on the top floor.

540
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,219
It's empty
because it's being renovated.

541
00:40:49,389 --> 00:40:52,050
- Pardon?
- The murder is set to happen today.

542
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:55,590
Seal off the top floor
and restrict everyone from entering.

543
00:40:55,929 --> 00:40:58,860
Only key medical staff are allowed.
For every medical staff,

544
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:00,760
we'll have two of us marking them
closely.

545
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,159
That's it.

546
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,969
(Emergency Stairs)

547
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:13,679

(Hogwanwon Premium Drink)

550
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:36,360
Is it about to rain?
My joints are aching.

551
00:42:37,489 --> 00:42:38,590
Gosh.

552
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:43,829
I didn't hear about any rain.

553
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,510
Will he really come to kill us?

554
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:53,579
Why us? It's just you.

555
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,880
Aren't you going to have
some chicken?

556
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:00,820
I might get sleepy.

557
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:02,789
It's going to be a long night.

558
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:04,420
Don't worry about it.

559
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,989
Even if he has a superpower,
do you think it's possible?

560
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:09,889
There are dozens of cameras
and eyes watching us.

561
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,530
There's no need to be afraid.

562
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,730
You can't eat food
next to a critical patient.

563
00:43:17,730 --> 00:43:19,539
Goodness, ma'am.

564
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,070
It must be so hard to be
standing up all day.

565
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:25,239
You should take care of your joints
when you're young.

566
00:43:25,239 --> 00:43:29,079
(Hogwanwon Premium Drink)

567
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:40,760
Keep eating.

568
00:43:48,199 --> 00:43:49,400
This one is mine.

569
00:44:04,449 --> 00:44:05,610
I'll take responsibility, sir.

570
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:11,119
Why should you when the one
who caused the mess is missing?

571
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,119
I'll strip Senior Superintendent Han
of her authority.

572
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:17,630
Leave her be.
I'll be the one to do it.

573
00:44:31,539 --> 00:44:33,510
Field Team One. Check your audio.

574
00:44:33,809 --> 00:44:35,139
We hear you nice and clear.

575
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:37,679
I'm certain he'll target
the security room first.

576
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:39,480
He needs to cut
the security cameras.

577
00:44:40,019 --> 00:44:41,219
We'll keep that in mind.

578
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:53,360
Professor Han.

579
00:44:54,230 --> 00:44:57,070
What do you think of Det. Dong?

580
00:44:58,269 --> 00:45:00,539
I'm just curious if you doubt
something as a profiler.

581
00:45:01,239 --> 00:45:02,300
Do you?

582
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,539
Well, I'm not sure.

583
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:06,179
- But something keeps bugging me.
- What?

584
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:09,010
At a rough glance,
he seems really clumsy.

585
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:12,380
But if you think about it later,
everything he did makes sense.

586
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,449
It's a strategy.

587
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:15,519
Phase two, identification of
friend or foe.

588
00:45:15,519 --> 00:45:17,949
On the outside,
he seems like a reckless idiot.

589
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:19,760
- But he feels like a genius?
- Yes.

590
00:45:20,719 --> 00:45:22,159
During one of your lectures,

591
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:23,960
you said it's more likely
to commit a crime...

592
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,289
if someone's different
on the inside and outside.

593
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:26,699
It's the opposite.

594
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,300
Criminals exaggerate their outside
in order to hide what's inside them.

595
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:31,829
- They're totally different.
- But still.

596
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,070
Something keeps bugging me.

597
00:45:35,469 --> 00:45:39,010
It's like he's wearing a mask.

598
00:45:42,309 --> 00:45:43,909
What happened?

599
00:45:48,019 --> 00:45:49,119
What's going on?

600
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:50,989
- What's happening?
- What's wrong with this?

601
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,059
Security room. Field Team One.

602
00:45:55,889 --> 00:45:57,090
The radio doesn't work either.

603
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:58,659
Our main server is down too.

604
00:45:58,659 --> 00:45:59,860
Find out why now.

605
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,829
I think it's an attack
from the outside.

606
00:46:01,829 --> 00:46:03,170
- From the outside?
- Someone is hacking us.

607
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:13,340
Everyone in the security room,
go to the ward.

608
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:15,380
Let's move!

609
00:46:15,639 --> 00:46:16,980
Darn it!

610
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,849
What's going on? It's under repair.

611
00:46:20,949 --> 00:46:22,079
Let's use the stairs.

612
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:31,289
All these attacks
have been planned out.

613
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:34,000
This isn't something
possible by humans.

614
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:49,780
- Hello?
- Move to the office immediately.

615
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:52,050
- What?
- You have been exposed. Move now!

616
00:46:54,780 --> 00:47:00,920
(VIP Ward)

617
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:23,110
What do we do?

618
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,579
Where's the RIU?

619
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:28,920
I can't reach our men
near the hospital room.

620
00:47:32,289 --> 00:47:33,789
- Woon Jang.
- They're alive.

621
00:47:33,789 --> 00:47:35,320
Hey! Hey!

622
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:38,489
Mr. Implant! Wake up!

623
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:42,530
Yes.

624
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:44,900
- What's going on?
- Are you okay?

625
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,269
They were unconscious
in the staircase.

626
00:47:46,639 --> 00:47:47,800
Secure the hospital room.

627
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:01,849
Open it! It won't open.

628
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:04,750
We've been locked in.

629
00:48:22,639 --> 00:48:23,909
I think everyone's down.

630
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:25,739
What do we do?

631
00:48:37,019 --> 00:48:38,119
He's coming.

632
00:48:40,219 --> 00:48:41,519
Get up already!

633
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,070
Don't make a fuss.

634
00:49:10,789 --> 00:49:12,619
I don't think he knew about
the SWAT Team's channel.

635
00:49:12,849 --> 00:49:14,190
He didn't attempt an attack.

636
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:19,530
- Is everything okay?
- What do you mean?

637
00:49:19,659 --> 00:49:21,929
- The situation over there.
- Don't be so lame.

638
00:49:23,769 --> 00:49:27,199
Now let's see
the face of the Eraser.

639
00:49:29,340 --> 00:49:30,469
How clever.

640
00:49:31,269 --> 00:49:32,869
You even fooled
the investigation team.

641
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:37,010
Well, if the investigation team
knew,

642
00:49:37,010 --> 00:49:39,110
it would be a matter of time before
being read by him.

643
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:42,480
That was really clever.

644
00:49:43,619 --> 00:49:47,090
A bold move by using the enemy's
target as bait.

645
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,030
Shut your mouth.

646
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:51,929
I'm just so excited.

647
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:57,000
Will he even be able to beat
machine guns?

648
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:59,429
I'll lock you up again
if you keep blabbering.

649
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:01,670
But you promised.

650
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:05,369
I promised to show him
get arrested.

651
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:06,710
I didn't say it would be in
real-time though.

652
00:50:09,849 --> 00:50:11,210
Humans are always like that.

653
00:50:12,550 --> 00:50:15,219
Playing with words
to break promises.

654
00:50:20,389 --> 00:50:22,489
I guess the saying
"Words are stronger than guns"...

655
00:50:22,489 --> 00:50:24,190
was just an old hoax.

656
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:33,239
Will this be the end for him?

657
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:37,739
If he opens that door?

658
00:51:24,449 --> 00:51:25,650
Freeze! Don't move!

659
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:45,969
Don't touch her!
She'll control you again!

660
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:51,079
Why are you here?

661
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:53,010
He asked me to come.

662
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:54,920
- Who?
- For one last time.

663
00:51:55,449 --> 00:51:57,619
- He wanted to see me.
- We can't understand you!

664
00:51:57,619 --> 00:51:59,920
Jin Jae Gyu said he was dying.

665
00:52:02,659 --> 00:52:03,730
It's the truth.

666
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:07,400
- Then where's the Eraser?
- Where is he?

667
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:12,170
I forgot he read my memory before.

668
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:13,869
- What?
- My trauma.

669
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:15,039
What are you saying?

670
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,469
- Is everything okay?
- What do you mean?

671
00:52:17,710 --> 00:52:18,840
The situation over there.

672
00:52:26,210 --> 00:52:27,719
What's going on now?

673
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:32,789
Senior Superintendent Han
is in danger.

674
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:34,519
Baek.

675
00:52:35,059 --> 00:52:36,659
Baek. Baek!

676
00:52:36,659 --> 00:52:37,789
Where is Senior Superintendent Han?

677
00:52:38,190 --> 00:52:40,300
- It's confidential.
- She's in danger!

678
00:52:49,070 --> 00:52:52,369
I told you
he wasn't an easy opponent.

679
00:52:52,539 --> 00:52:53,710
The phone won't work either.

680
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:56,239
- Fix it now!
- I'll check the phone cables.

681
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:17,369
I want to apologize.

682
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:20,369
For what I did to your father.

683
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,699
Shut your mouth.
Now is not the time.

684
00:53:22,969 --> 00:53:25,170
No, I need to apologize now.

685
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:41,460
That you regret it?

686
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:42,960
No.

687
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:47,530
If I'm placed in the same situation,
I'll kill him again.

688
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,130
Then what do you want to
apologize for?

689
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:51,929
Since the pain I caused you...

690
00:53:53,699 --> 00:53:55,300
is my karma.

691
00:54:02,710 --> 00:54:05,050
The karma you caused
with that mouth of yours is worse.

692
00:54:06,579 --> 00:54:07,619
I know.

693
00:54:09,719 --> 00:54:11,849
That a few words won't be able
to erase my past.

694
00:54:12,889 --> 00:54:14,860
It will never be erased.

695
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:17,130
This is the same thing.

696
00:54:17,989 --> 00:54:20,360
No matter how much
he erases my memory,

697
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,070
something still remains vaguely.

698
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:25,769
Are you talking about fear again?

699
00:54:26,199 --> 00:54:27,440
No.

700
00:54:28,900 --> 00:54:30,070
The smell.

701
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:32,510
The smell of death.

702
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,849
This place reeks of it right now.

703
00:54:43,119 --> 00:54:44,150
Stop!

704
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,590
It's him. Shoot him!

705
00:54:52,989 --> 00:54:54,000
It's him!

706
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:58,070
Don't hesitate and shoot him!

707
00:54:59,369 --> 00:55:00,599
Name and rank.

708
00:55:02,969 --> 00:55:04,010
- Now!
- Take off your mask...

709
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:05,070
and state your name and rank!

710
00:55:07,309 --> 00:55:08,380
Do you want to die?

711
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:13,010
Shoot him now!

712
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:15,679
Name and rank!

713
00:55:30,329 --> 00:55:31,500
Take off your mask.

714
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:46,739
I should've known it was you.

715
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:50,179
Shoot him. Shoot him now!

716
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:57,250
It doesn't matter if I die.
Shoot him now!

717
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:18,469
Seal off the first floor
and use the stairs.

718
00:57:21,579 --> 00:57:22,710
The elevator is coming down.

719
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:44,170
The stairs!

720
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:56,110
(SWAT)

721
00:58:53,639 --> 00:58:54,840
Don't forget.

722
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,210
You must find him.

723
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:59,809
The target is on the first floor.
He's dressed as a SWAT agent.

724
00:59:00,840 --> 00:59:01,909
We lost all our leads.

725
00:59:02,409 --> 00:59:05,179
Why am I the most painful sacrifice
to you?

726
00:59:05,349 --> 00:59:06,349
I'll tell you in time.

727
00:59:06,349 --> 00:59:08,480
Isn't it strange?
Dying on the same day and time?

728
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,389
It doesn't add up.
Everyone will know the moment I die.

729
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:12,650
The Eraser's identity.

730
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,860
I need your help. Wait for me.

731
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:18,190
I don't care if I die now.
I'm going to put an end to this.

732
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:20,860
- Are you crazy! Don't go in there!
- Det. Dong!
