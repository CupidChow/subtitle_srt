5
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,230
Did you say the Eraser showed up?

6
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,930
The son of a section chief
from our headquarters...

7
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:05,560
- was terrorized two days ago.
- Who?

8
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,829
Section Chief Cheon Ki Soo.

9
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:13,740
What else?

10
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,409
Yesterday, the Eraser targeted
a firefighter in Shimbae City,

11
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:17,479
but he failed.

12
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,680
"Failed"?

13
00:02:24,919 --> 00:02:26,280
Is Dong Baek involved?

14
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:29,250
Yes. How did you know?

15
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,060
Where is he?

16
00:02:33,259 --> 00:02:34,629
We're trying to figure that out.

17
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:37,729
- What about the firefighter?
- Pardon?

18
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:40,330
Where is the firefighter
the Eraser was targeting?

19
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:42,699
He was admitted
to Shimbae General Hospital.

20
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:48,409
Does the firefighter know a doctor
from the hospital?

21
00:02:49,009 --> 00:02:50,280
How did you know?

22
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,680
Byun.

23
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:55,979
You can only ask questions
when I allow it. Did you forget?

24
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,180
I'm sorry, sir.

25
00:02:59,919 --> 00:03:02,349
The firefighter's wife
is a doctor at the hospital.

26
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,500
- Byun Young Soo.
- Yes?

27
00:03:12,699 --> 00:03:15,000
If you can't catch the Eraser,

28
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:17,800
your career will end
as a senior superintendent.

29
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:21,370
- I'm sorry.
- It's not the same for me.

30
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,370
It'll hurt my pride,

31
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:26,509
but it's your neck on the line.

32
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,379
I'll keep that in mind.

33
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,620
The prosecution is trying
to get their hands on this case.

34
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,590
They'll call it a join investigation
so they can steal it.

35
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,520
Even if you catch him, they'll brief
everyone that it was thanks to them.

36
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,159
If you fail, they'll make the police
look incompetent.

37
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:45,330
Get it solved before
they take it away.

38
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:48,400
You need to resolve it
within three days at maximum.

39
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm not saying this for me,

40
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:53,639
but for you.

41
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,939
Yes, sir.

42
00:04:07,889 --> 00:04:10,319
- Yes, sir.
- Cancel all morning appointments.

43
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,090
Get Kim Do Su from
the Intelligence Agency to come.

44
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,629
- Do you mean Chief Kim?
- No,

45
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:16,759
I mean Inspector Kim Do Su!

(Shimbae General Hospital)

47
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,220
Why isn't he waking up?

48
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,519
It's hard to tell
with this equipment.

49
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:45,689
We're monitoring him just in case.

50
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,660
Why don't we transfer him
to your lab now?

51
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,899
He's pretty stable,
so we'll transfer him soon.

52
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,329
Please guarantee his security.
He's being chased by prosecutors.

53
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:57,600
Are you worried?

54
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,939
I've known Baek for seven years.

55
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,639
At first,
I thought he was a swindler.

56
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,750
Once I realized he wasn't lying,
he looked like a savior.

57
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,949
I could really see a halo on him.

58
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,050
But now,
he's like my little brother.

59
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:17,720
I'm worried about him
more than anything.

60
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,959
I wonder if we got too close.

61
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:23,189
I just hope he'll stay healthy.

62
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:26,730
Do you think it's not possible
for him to stay healthy?

63
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:31,970
It's not looking good.
He's fainting more frequently now.

64
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,839
I want you to stop him.

65
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,279
It's dangerous for him
to keep on scanning memories.

66
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,610
What do you mean it's dangerous?

67
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,850
I can't be sure since
I can't make any comparisons,

68
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:49,550
but I'm certain he's dying.

69
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:52,920
- Why didn't you tell him?
- I did. Many times.

70
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,360
However, he won't stop.

71
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,230
He's like a runaway train
who believes it's his fate to crash.

72
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:04,269
Scanning more memories
is like committing suicide for him.

(Eight years ago)

75
00:06:23,089 --> 00:06:25,259
Your change is 40 cents.

76
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,029
Did you see him smile
when he touched our hands?

77
00:06:36,529 --> 00:06:38,839
- He looked disgusted.
- Hey.

78
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:41,339
My heart is aching.

79
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:45,610
He's such a kind man, but he
grew up lonely at an orphanage.

80
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,209
It makes me tear up.

81
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:48,779
Hello.

82
00:06:48,779 --> 00:06:51,649
I wrote this all night.
Please read it.

83
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:53,279
- Please take this.
- Here.

84
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,620
Those girls are so old.

85
00:06:54,850 --> 00:06:56,620
How vulgar.

86
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:00,189
I heard he doesn't have any friends.

87
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:01,790
- Really?
- Yes.

88
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:05,430
That's why he's always alone.
He doesn't have any.

89
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,129
- Is he a loner?
- Watch it.

90
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:08,769
Have you ever seen a loner
as handsome as him?

91
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,089
Are you happy?

92
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:33,990
No way.

93
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:35,759
What is it? Open them.

94
00:07:36,259 --> 00:07:38,459
I'm going to give them
to the little ones at the orphanage.

95
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,399
But they're for you. Why?

96
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,000
No reason.

97
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,800
How ridiculous.

98
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,839
You're the one who told me
to work at the convenience store.

99
00:07:47,569 --> 00:07:49,939
I told you to practice whenever
you touch the customers' hands.

100
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:52,379
I didn't tell you
to call in your fan club.

101
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,550
I didn't call in anyone.

102
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:57,110
It doesn't matter. So, how was it?

103
00:07:57,579 --> 00:07:59,420
I told you, I'm not enjoying this.

104
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:03,220
That's not what I'm asking.
How did your practice go?

105
00:08:03,889 --> 00:08:05,259
The practice?

106
00:08:07,529 --> 00:08:10,759
I can somewhat control it now.

107
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,500
People's memories used to
flow in whenever they brushed by,

108
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,699
but now I can control it.

109
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,310
You must be happy to touch
the hands of young girls.

110
00:08:24,579 --> 00:08:25,680
But...

111
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,680
I'm going to quit now.

112
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,550
Why?

113
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,550
You should train more
and improve your...

114
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,620
No.

115
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,250
I don't want to be affected
by their memories.

116
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,090
I thought you could control it.

117
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,490
There are some feelings
I can't filter out.

118
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,929
Pain and hurt.

119
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:48,370
I can sense such unpleasant feelings
the earliest.

120
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:51,399
I don't want to do it anymore.

121
00:09:02,909 --> 00:09:04,049
Thanks.

122
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:07,289
For what?

123
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,720
If it wasn't for you,

124
00:09:09,789 --> 00:09:11,919
I would've never thought
about training like this.

125
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,919
Why have you never asked me
for help?

126
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:41,590
What do you mean?

127
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,850
The training. Why don't you want
to do it with me?

128
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:47,220
The training? Well...

129
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:50,700
It's because...

130
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:53,200
Well...

131
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,830
I'm leaving.

132
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:59,840
It doesn't work with you.

133
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,539
It doesn't work...

134
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:06,480
the way I want it to.

135
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,080
Why not?

136
00:10:15,289 --> 00:10:16,350
I don't know.

137
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:24,500
Why don't you know?

138
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:31,070
My mind...

139
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,500
just goes blank...

140
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,870
Detective Dong.

141
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,110
You shouldn't get up.

142
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,750
Detective Dong...

143
00:11:16,549 --> 00:11:18,120
Detective Dong woke up.

144
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:21,220
Detective Dong!

145
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,690
Why did you come out?
There are a lot of people here.

146
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:29,490
The Eraser... He has a big scar
on his right arm.

147
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,429
We know.
Go back to your room for now.

148
00:11:31,629 --> 00:11:34,299
He left Mr. Noh a clue. Where is he?

149
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,100
He disappeared.

150
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,669
He vanished into thin air
early in the morning.

151
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,039
What did the Eraser leave behind?

152
00:11:51,179 --> 00:11:52,250
He put something...

153
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,049
in Mr. Noh's nostril.

154
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:57,149
In his nostril?

155
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,600
All the other CCTVs except
for the elevators' were down.

156
00:12:06,129 --> 00:12:07,899
An outside vendor
had backup footage.

157
00:12:12,269 --> 00:12:13,669
Second basement level?

158
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:16,769
It's a parking lot. We're looking
into all the vehicles' blackboxes.

159
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,580
Why did he abduct him?

160
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:20,480
What did Mr. Noh see?

161
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,809
No, he's not trying
to get rid of a witness.

162
00:12:24,179 --> 00:12:25,980
His purpose was murder itself.

163
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,519
He enjoyed watching...

164
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:30,220
Mr. Noh die.

165
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,029
Are these the only vehicles
that left the hospital?

166
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,289
Yes. It was too early
in the morning.

167
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:38,460
What about that portable bed?

168
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,259
Sorry?

169
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,230
Did you find it in the parking lot?

170
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,639
No.

171
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:46,669
Did you check all the trucks?

172
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,169
Yes, we did.

173
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,909
What about the hallways?

174
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:52,110
I didn't see it.

175
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,610
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

176
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,720
What is it?

177
00:12:58,049 --> 00:13:00,179
- They're still in the building.
- What?

178
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,419
The Eraser probably needed
an ambulance or a truck...

179
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:04,120
to move the bed outside.

180
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,120
But the only vehicles that left
the hospital were sedans.

181
00:13:08,289 --> 00:13:09,690
If it's not the parking lot...

182
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:11,330
What else is down there?

183
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:14,169
We have several rooms.

184
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:36,649
- He's going to asphyxiate Mr. Noh.
- "Suffocate"?

185
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,919
Since the Eraser failed to do so,
he's going to attempt it again.

186
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,730
- What should we do?
- Look for enclosed areas.

187
00:13:42,129 --> 00:13:43,460
You three, start from here.

188
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:44,860
Yes, ma'am.

189

(Nutrition Team, Cafeteria)

190
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,820
- The cafeteria.
- The cafeteria?

191
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,190
The fridges.

192
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,730
I know.

193
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,200
Police.

194
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,500
We'd like to check your fridges.

195
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,750
Where are the freezers?

196
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,149
It's one floor below.

197
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:40,220
Let's go.

198
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,090
Wait here. Let me check on them.

199
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,590
Darn it.

200
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:04,240
The door didn't open,
so we called a technician.

201
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,279
Darn it.

202
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,950
Where did Se Hoon go?

203
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,659
Hey. What?

204
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:25,230
They're in front of the freezer.

What are you doing in here?

208
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:05,220
I'm a police officer. We're looking
for a patient who has disappeared.

209
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:07,279
Only dead bodies are down here.

210
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:09,119
I'd like to check inside.

211
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,789
They're all empty.

212
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:12,789
- All of them?
- Yes.

213
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,490
Then why is it turned on?

214
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,400
Sorry?

215
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:22,970
This one.

216
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,900
Why is this on?

217
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,819
Good work.

218
00:20:12,349 --> 00:20:13,450
What about me?

219
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,220
He's turned the corner.

220
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,390
His vital signs are stable.
We'll keep monitoring.

221
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,859
Thank you.

222
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,960
See? Mr. Noh is a resilient man.

223
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,230
Like you said,
I found this in his nostril.

224
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,539
I'll be going now.

225

"An innocent will be crucified..."

226
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,779
"instead of the sinner."

227
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:44,309
He's punishing on their behalf.

228
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,750
"On their behalf"?

229
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:48,950
He's taking his revenge
on the sinner...

230
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:50,619
by killing an innocent.

231
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,559
The "Sinner"?

232
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,400
I'm sure you've heard of the Eraser.

233
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,140
- The Eraser?
- The serial killer...

234
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,079
who got himself a fan club
a few days after being on the news.

235
00:21:16,779 --> 00:21:18,380
What about him?

236
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,019
He's after your husband.

237
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,890
What? Why would he do that?

238
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,789
You do know
who Mr. Cheon Ki Soo is, right?

239
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:30,089
- Sorry, who?
- He's the section chief.

240
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:34,000
Two days ago,
his son was murdered...

241
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:36,069
by the Eraser.

242
00:21:47,579 --> 00:21:49,849
A murderer who always prioritized
his justification...

243
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:51,480
changed his method of killing.

244
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,319
He burned an ordinary young man...

245
00:21:54,849 --> 00:21:57,549
and then attempted to kill
a respectable firefighter twice.

246
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,289
Why do you think he did that?

247
00:22:02,789 --> 00:22:03,960
How should I know?

248
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:17,640
"An innocent will be crucified
instead of the sinner."

249
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:23,349
I believe he's talking to you.
Am I wrong?

250
00:22:28,289 --> 00:22:29,519
If you don't tell me,

251
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,190
your husband will continue
to be in danger.

252
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:41,230
It'll be easy for us to find out.

253
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,839
Would you like me
to read your secret?

254
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:02,190
It happened 20 years ago
when I was on night duty.

255
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:05,690
A body came in,

256
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,460
so I went to the morgue to check.

257
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:19,769
A young man had jumped to his death.

258
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,970
His body was severely marred.

259
00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:28,779
And that's when
Section Chief Cheon came.

260
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,180
Why?

261
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,490
He wanted to hear the result.

262
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,119
Which was?

263
00:23:39,089 --> 00:23:42,059
It did seem like
he fell to his death,

264
00:23:42,829 --> 00:23:43,990
but something seemed off.

265
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:46,000
What do you mean?

266
00:23:46,130 --> 00:23:49,369
He had fresh two-degree burns
on his arm.

267
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:52,839
Maybe he just scraped it
on his way down.

268
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:57,740
As a doctor, I can differentiate
a burn from a scrape.

269
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,279
So?

270
00:24:00,809 --> 00:24:02,579
We need to perform an autopsy.

271
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,920
Come on, now.
He even wrote a suicide note.

272
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,079
It's obviously a suicide.

273
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,589
I met the prosecutor in charge.

274
00:24:15,990 --> 00:24:19,299
He was annoyed by the number
of autopsies that were carried out.

275
00:24:24,569 --> 00:24:26,000
What did you just do?

276
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:27,170
Ms. Song Sook Hyu,

277
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:29,069
your son's quite ill, isn't he?

278
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,009
What did you say?

279
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:35,279
Doesn't he need
a bone-marrow transplant?

280
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:39,819
Who are you?

281
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,420
A savior...

282
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:44,619
who will save your son.

283
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,460
You fabricated the cause of death...

284
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:52,960
so they wouldn't perform an autopsy.

285
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:25,859
He promised to help my son live.

286
00:25:28,029 --> 00:25:30,930
He promised to provide
a donor immediately.

287
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:34,240
You didn't even know him,
so why did you believe him?

288
00:25:36,009 --> 00:25:38,809
It hadn't even been two hours
since that young man's death.

289
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:42,309
But he found out
my weakness in that time.

290
00:25:43,779 --> 00:25:45,420
Instinctively, I knew...

291
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,519
that someone...

292
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:51,450
very powerful was behind him.

For the past 20 years,

I never forgot that name
even for a moment.

Why not?

304

I got my punishment already.

305
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,430
My son found a donor,

00:27:43,529 --> 00:27:45,500
but he ended up dying anyway.

307

Didn't I make myself clear?

Yes, sir.

327

00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:19,720
- Did he disappear?
- He was there just a moment ago.

330
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,589
Find him before it's too late.

331
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:25,089
Your big sister
is desperately looking for you.

332
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,799
- What big sister?
- You should stay here.

333
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,869
Why? So I could scan the memories
of Noh Gwang Gyu's wife?

334
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:32,299
No, there's nothing else we can get
from her.

335
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:33,670
Then why?

336
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:36,109
It's dangerous for him
to keep on scanning memories.

337
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,880
You need to get well first.

338
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,809
Gosh. You're only two years older.

339
00:30:41,809 --> 00:30:43,410
Stop acting like
you're my big sister.

340
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,150
You'll get in my way
if you faint again.

341
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:48,950
Also, we're four years apart.

342
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:53,559
Good for you for looking young.

343
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,299
His name was Moon Yong Dae.

344
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:02,329
In February of 2000, he committed
suicide the year he turned 20.

345
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:05,069
His mother also committed suicide
that same year.

346
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:07,799
The only family he has left
is his father, Moon Chul Ju.

347
00:31:08,769 --> 00:31:11,369
Their address in Shimbae City
is still the same.

348
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:13,210
Okay, thank you.

349
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:15,380
No problem.

350
00:31:15,849 --> 00:31:17,049
By the way...

351
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,349
Professor Han?

352
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:32,430
Two months after Moon Yong Dae
was murdered,

353
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,960
seven people died
in the abandoned factory.

354
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:35,400
In the Eraser's hands.

355
00:31:35,569 --> 00:31:38,000
Why did those seven people
kill Moon Yong Dae?

356
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:43,240
On what grounds?

357
00:31:43,339 --> 00:31:44,769
Cheon Ki Soo is the link.

358
00:31:45,009 --> 00:31:48,240
He forced his way to get involved
in both cases and covered them.

359
00:31:48,579 --> 00:31:51,109
If the Eraser was avenging
Moon Yong Dae,

360
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,680
who is the suspect?
Moon Yong Dae's father?

361
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,029
- Yes?
- Cheon Ki Soo disappeared.

362
00:32:02,289 --> 00:32:03,359
What?

363
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,089
He got changed in a hurry.

364
00:32:05,859 --> 00:32:07,000
I think he went into hiding.

365
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,069
- Hurry up and find him.
- It's easy for you to say.

366
00:32:09,529 --> 00:32:11,130
How can we find him
when he's determined to hide?

367
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,039
Your expertise is finding people.

368
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:15,099
He holds the key to Shimbae City,
so hurry!

369
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:18,640
Why didn't you read his memories
properly last night?

370
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:19,779
Hello?

371
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,579
Did he hang up?

372
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:24,079
Does he think he's my boss?

373
00:32:24,079 --> 00:32:26,079
He thinks I'll listen to his orders,
doesn't he?

374
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,349
- But you do.
- What did you say?

375
00:32:31,089 --> 00:32:34,220
By the way, doesn't Baek
look strange to you these days?

376
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,759
He's fainting so often
as if he's about to die.

377
00:32:38,829 --> 00:32:40,960
Why are you worried about
such a ridiculous thing?

378
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,970
He's known to be the strangest guy
in the world.

379
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:49,170
That pain in the neck
would never die before me.

380
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:51,369
You're so harsh.

381
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,559
(Moon Chul Ju)

382
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,220
I think this place was empty
for a long time.

383
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,890
None of the packages are open...

384
00:33:43,029 --> 00:33:45,359
as if they're waiting for
an unexpected visitor.

385
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:50,299
Perhaps they're waiting
for the owner of the house.

386
00:33:59,109 --> 00:34:00,240
They look alike.

387
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,320
Hello?

388
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,360
Who...

389
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:22,630
- Han Sun Mi?
- The Eraser?

390
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:27,900
Dong Baek. The deaths
are happening because of your sins.

391
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:31,039
It's because of the crime
you committed on Meadow.

392
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,010
What?

393
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,610
Meadow.

394
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:38,409
"Meadow".

395
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:45,789
It's what Jin Jae Gyu said
as his last words.

396
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:49,989
Meadow...

397
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,099
Meadow...

398
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,360
He told me to look for Meadow.

399
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,369
No matter what...

400
00:34:58,269 --> 00:34:59,440
No matter what.

401
00:35:04,039 --> 00:35:05,610
(Seven years ago)

402
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,610
The phone is turned off.

403
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,949
Please
leave a message after the beep.

404
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:14,250
Why is your phone turned off?

405
00:35:14,619 --> 00:35:15,889
Call me when you see this.

406
00:35:16,289 --> 00:35:17,289
(Sent to Meadow)

407
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,019
- I'll get going, sir.
- Okay.

408
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:24,329
Hello, I'm Ko Hyun A.

409
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,170
The phone is turned off. Please
leave a message after the beep.

410
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:34,940
Hello, I'm Ko Hyun A.

411
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,099
(Missing)

412
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:02,969
(Name: Seol Meadow)

413
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,909
(Missing)

414
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,639
He told you to find Meadow?

415
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:17,010
Does it ring a bell?

416
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,949
(Situation Room)

417
00:36:23,949 --> 00:36:26,159
- Yes, what is it?
- It's me.

418
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,329
- I see.
- It's upsetting...

419
00:36:29,429 --> 00:36:31,659
to find out you only contacted
Bong Kook and not us.

420
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,300
You two shouldn't get involved.

421
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,460
Deputy Chief Lee
gave a strict order.

422
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,730
I don't care about that.
Bong Kook can only hack.

423
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:40,239
It's Seul Bi and me who are
professionals at researching.

424
00:36:40,570 --> 00:36:42,969
Superintendent Han,
we found more information.

425
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,710
Late Moon Yong Dae's father
Moon Chul Ju...

426
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:47,239
has been missing
since 10 years ago.

427
00:36:47,579 --> 00:36:48,710
- "Missing"?
- Yes.

428
00:36:48,809 --> 00:36:51,050
He became an alcoholic
after his son died,

429
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,320
then he ran away from home.

430
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,820
Who made the report?

431
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:56,789
A relative named Moon Yong Gwang.
He's a first cousin once removed.

432
00:36:56,989 --> 00:37:00,289
There are records of payment for
the utilities made by the cousin.

433
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,789
Does he have any siblings?

434
00:37:02,789 --> 00:37:04,260
No, he's the only child.

435
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,829
He was adopted.

436
00:37:08,929 --> 00:37:10,030
"Adopted"?

437
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,070
Moon Chul Ju probably had
his second son...

438
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,300
registered under a relative.

439
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:18,210
From this moment, Moon Yong Gwang
is the key suspect.

440
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:19,710
Find him as soon as possible.

441
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,039
I already forwarded you
his information.

442
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,650
I'm good at researching too.

443
00:37:27,650 --> 00:37:30,489
Moon Yong Gwang, 37 years old.
After leaving the special forces,

444
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:32,920
he worked for six years as a member
of the police's SWAT team.

445
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,320
(SWAT)

446
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,659
He retired a year ago and became
a guard. It's unusual.

447
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,429
He wouldn't have any personal time.

448
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:42,900
How can he be the Eraser?

449
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:45,230
Moon Yong Gwang's employer
has been abroad for six months.

450
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:46,840
That makes it possible.

451
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,809
"Bang Jun Seok"? He's famous.

452
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,639
Let's go to former assemblyman
Bang Jun Seok's home first.

453
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:58,679
Your destination is up ahead.

454
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:07,960
What's going on?

455
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:20,500
Don't make any calls.

456
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:23,139
The prosecution has
your number bugged.

457
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,210
Chief Prosecutor Woo Seok Do
is on his way.

458
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:28,039
How did you know that?

459
00:38:28,579 --> 00:38:30,380
We have a source there.

460
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,880
You could get hurt at this rate.

461
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:35,579
We can worry about that later.

462
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:38,050
What's going on?

463
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:40,320
Assemblyman Bang Jun Seok's wife
was abducted.

464
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,829
She was abducted yesterday,
but the report was made just now.

465
00:38:43,829 --> 00:38:45,260
It's currently under embargo.

466
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:49,500
- The wife of Assemblyman Bang?
- Eun Soo Gyeong.

467
00:38:49,699 --> 00:38:51,429
Her nickname is Mother Teresa,
right?

468
00:38:51,769 --> 00:38:54,139
She's a social activist,
so she wouldn't have any enemies.

469
00:38:54,139 --> 00:38:55,269
Probably not.

470
00:38:55,269 --> 00:38:58,369
Most people think
she's a good person.

471
00:39:00,179 --> 00:39:02,309
"An innocent will be crucified..."

472
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:04,210
"Instead of the sinner."

473
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,280
Let's see who the real sinner is.

474
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,250
What are you going to do?
The prosecution will be here soon.

475
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:13,760
Det. Dong!

476
00:39:29,039 --> 00:39:30,070
Let's go.

477
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,480
Senior Superintendent Han.

478
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,750
We're under strict order
by the deputy chief.

479
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,789
- Please make way.
- I'll be fired.

480
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:47,289
Are you being a coward?

481
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,429
You should cover your face.
I have to arrest you if I see you.

482
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,130
- Chief Byun.
- Let's go in.

483
00:39:56,869 --> 00:39:59,070
- But Deputy Chief Lee said...
- You too.

484
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:23,789
She's her personal assistant.

485
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:25,090
She was there
when the abduction happened.

486
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,400
Where's Moon Yong Gwang?

487
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:30,300
Chief Secretary Moon?

488
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:35,000
He went to pick up Mr. Bang from
the airport. They'll be back soon.

489
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:37,539
- Brief me.
- Okay.

490
00:40:40,809 --> 00:40:43,210
She was abducted
from a basement parking lot...

491
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:45,079
of a hospital
after her ob-gyn check-up.

492
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:49,619
Luckily, the abduction was recorded
on the dashcam of a delivery truck.

493
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:53,059
We found only the vehicle
near the hospital.

494
00:40:55,889 --> 00:40:57,460
Do you remember anything
about the criminal?

495
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,059
A wound.

496
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,630
He had a wound on his wrist.

497
00:41:04,969 --> 00:41:06,000
Was it his right hand?

498
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,070
- Yes.
- Anything else?

499
00:41:11,809 --> 00:41:14,179
Have you seen a similar wound
like that around you?

500
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,750
Could you give us some privacy?

501
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:21,380
Okay.

502
00:41:26,519 --> 00:41:27,889
Do you have the details
about the victim's family?

503
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:30,360
- Are you talking about Mr. Bang?
- No, her parents.

504
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,630
Here.

505
00:41:33,199 --> 00:41:35,230
The victim's father,
Chief Justice Eun Young Pyo,

506
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,730
died from an illness last year.

507
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,570
Her mother is currently working
as a principal.

508
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,800
"District commissioner
of Shimbae City"...

509
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:48,639
(Vice-principal
of Shimbae High School)

510
00:41:48,639 --> 00:41:50,349
She was the vice-principal
of Shimbae High School.

511
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:52,079
The sinner must be one or the other.

512
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:53,920
Or it could be both.

513
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,320
Let me hear what you think.

514
00:41:58,389 --> 00:42:00,789
The Eraser stopped imitating
the Executioner...

515
00:42:00,789 --> 00:42:02,260
and started his revenge.

516
00:42:02,929 --> 00:42:04,760
He's killing the families
of his enemies.

517
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:07,699
- "The families"?
- He's making them feel...

518
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:09,429
the pain he experienced
when he lost his family.

519
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:13,539
Then Section Chief Cheon
and the wife of that firefighter...

520
00:42:13,539 --> 00:42:15,300
They're accomplices
who covered up the case.

521
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,670
Is he doing this just because
they covered it up?

522
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,440
He's getting rid of
everyone involved...

523
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,710
to strike his target with more fear.

524
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,679
The Eraser's method of revenge
is building fear.

525
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:27,179
The Eraser will kill the sinner last
to make them suffer.

526
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,119
Is this abduction related too?

527
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:32,619
They're getting the punishment
in place of their parents.

528
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:34,719
Is Moon Yong Gwang
really the Eraser?

529
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:36,590
There's a 50 percent chance.

530
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:39,630
We should check if we're ready
to fight him. He's a fast one.

531
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:42,630
Here comes another fast one.

532
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,570
What a sight.

533
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:51,539
Are you having a meeting with
someone who's wanted?

534
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,880
This is why the police need
to follow the prosecution's orders.

535
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:58,650
- Don't you agree, Chief Byun?
- Please wait.

536
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,949
We'll pass the video to you soon.

537
00:43:01,179 --> 00:43:03,019
Is this a comedy club?

538
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,550
You'll regret it
if you make a scene here.

539
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,119
- What are you doing?
- They're here.

540
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:31,480
I'm Chief Byun Young Soo of Seoul
Metropolitan Police Agency's RIU.

541
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:34,980
Do you have any news about my wife?

542
00:43:36,519 --> 00:43:37,750
We're doing our best.

543
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:41,860
What's going on?

544
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:44,329
I'm Chief Prosecutor Woo Seok Do...

545
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:45,530
from the Central District
Prosecutor's Office.

546
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,130
Is this a joint investigation?

547
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:52,800
We came to arrest the criminal
who infiltrated your house.

548
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,539
- A "criminal"?
- I think he's talking about me.

549
00:43:59,909 --> 00:44:01,079
Det. Dong Baek?

550
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:05,809
- What are you doing here?
- We're looking for the abductor.

551
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:08,019
We'll get things sorted out
as soon as possible.

552
00:44:08,449 --> 00:44:11,349
He's been suspended anyway.

553
00:44:11,889 --> 00:44:13,989
Are you trying to humiliate me?

554
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,429
I'm sorry? What do you mean?

555
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,989
I'm asking you if you're trying
to let my wife get killed...

556
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:21,230
because I'm not
an assemblyman anymore.

557
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:23,030
Of course not.

558
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:25,730
You should be including him
if anything.

559
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,269
Why are you excluding
Detective Superpower?

560
00:44:28,639 --> 00:44:30,769
It's a misunderstanding.

561
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:33,780
Get out right now.

562
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:36,210
Evacuate right away.

563
00:44:37,849 --> 00:44:39,380
I want you to leave first.

564
00:44:47,659 --> 00:44:48,719
They're coming out.

565
00:44:49,989 --> 00:44:51,889
Did you fail to arrest Det. Dong?

566
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:54,800
What do you think about people
saying you have a personal grudge?

567
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,769
Is it a joint investigation?

568
00:44:56,769 --> 00:44:58,300
Do you have any information
on the abductor?

569
00:44:58,300 --> 00:44:59,400
Is it due to a political reason?

570
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:01,099
Please make a comment.

571
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:03,969
Is Det. Dong going to be in charge
of the investigation after all?

572
00:45:08,679 --> 00:45:09,980
Please help me.

573
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,630
Could I look at your arm?

574
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,369
My arm?

575
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:34,440
Why do you ask?

576
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:38,309
The criminal has a big wound
on his right arm.

577
00:45:43,349 --> 00:45:44,849
What are you doing? Show him.

578
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:04,869
Wait.

579
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,039
Your left arm too.

580
00:46:08,269 --> 00:46:09,440
Show them.

581
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,300
It looked like a scar from a knife.

582
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:40,440
How did you get that scar?

583
00:46:41,469 --> 00:46:44,710
I got injured while handling
explosives in the military.

584
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:46,840
Can I read your memory then?

585
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,010
To see when his wife was kidnapped.

586
00:46:54,150 --> 00:46:55,280
No.

587
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,250
Mr. Moon, what do you think
you're doing?

588
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:04,389
What do I have to do?

589
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:07,400
- Nothing.
- Let's look for another way.

590
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:11,070
Is there a better way than this
in this situation?

591
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:12,570
We can arrest him and investigate...

592
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,090
What are you doing?

593
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:37,230
Put down that knife!

594
00:47:37,929 --> 00:47:39,059
Don't move.

595
00:47:39,329 --> 00:47:40,559
These aren't blanks. Put it down.

596
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:42,760
You might die.

597
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:49,300
Mr. Moon.

598
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:51,610
What, is this what you really were?

599
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:53,510
You piece of trash.

600
00:47:54,809 --> 00:47:55,940
Please help me.

601
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,449
What do we do?

602
00:47:59,719 --> 00:48:01,880
- Seal off the roads.
- Seal off the roads.

603
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:04,619
Seal off the roads. Did you hear me?

604
00:48:32,679 --> 00:48:33,949
- Follow him!
- Hey!

605
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:35,849
Hey!

606
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:16,960
Stop!

607
00:49:17,329 --> 00:49:19,059
Hey! My motorcycle!

608
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,210
What are you doing?

609
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,179
He couldn't have gotten far.

610
00:49:42,179 --> 00:49:43,719
We can't catch a motorcycle
in the middle of the city.

611
00:49:44,750 --> 00:49:46,619
Then what? Do you want to give up?

612
00:49:46,719 --> 00:49:48,789
I know where he's going.
The records.

613
00:49:48,789 --> 00:49:50,489
Take a left turn soon.

614
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:53,829
The record of him
leaving the hospital...

615
00:49:53,829 --> 00:49:55,159
right after kidnapping
Eun Soo Gyeong.

616
00:49:56,599 --> 00:49:59,000
(Sang-dong, Shimbae City)

617
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:27,199
Please let me go.

618
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:30,670
I won't say anything to the police.

619
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:32,469
I didn't even see your face.

620
00:50:43,880 --> 00:50:47,650
(An innocent person will be
crucified instead of the sinner.)

621
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:13,170
Darn it.

622
00:52:33,489 --> 00:52:34,960
Go check upstairs.

623
00:52:35,219 --> 00:52:37,030
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

624
00:52:46,099 --> 00:52:47,840
(Unidentified Number)

625
00:52:52,809 --> 00:52:55,079
It isn't me. I'm not a murderer.

626
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,579
Moon Yong Gwang?

627
00:52:56,679 --> 00:52:58,210
All I did was chase after...

628
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,079
the Eraser.

629
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:03,219
That's nonsense.

630
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:05,289
I've been chasing after him
all my life.

631
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,219
I was so close.

632
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,260
Who is he?

633
00:53:10,489 --> 00:53:11,559
The scar on his arm.

634
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,230
I saw a scar on his right arm.

635
00:53:15,929 --> 00:53:17,030
So who is it?

636
00:53:18,699 --> 00:53:19,800
It's inside there.

637
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,639
A red button.

638
00:53:24,110 --> 00:53:25,239
"A Red button"?

639
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:35,619
Wait. It might be a bomb.

640
00:53:38,889 --> 00:53:40,090
Step back.

641
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,239
- Hey, wait!
- What do you want?

642
00:55:05,539 --> 00:55:06,710
You can't come in here.

643
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:08,110
Please leave!

644
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,349
What do you think you're doing?

645
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:11,480
- Security!
- You.

646
00:55:11,480 --> 00:55:13,820
You were there 20 years ago
in Shimbae!

647
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:16,280
- What?
- You were the Eraser.

648
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:18,690
- What did you say?
- You shouldn't scan him.

649
00:55:36,469 --> 00:55:37,610
Stop!

650
00:58:23,869 --> 00:58:24,969
It was you.

651
00:58:26,539 --> 00:58:27,610
Don't lie.

652
00:58:30,550 --> 00:58:32,880
The person who killed
seven people in Shimbae City...

653
00:58:33,849 --> 00:58:35,449
20 years ago.

654
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:41,289
No... No.

655
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:44,929
No... No, it's not me!

656
00:58:50,829 --> 00:58:53,269
The murderer... The Eraser...

657
00:58:57,510 --> 00:58:58,840
It's you.

658
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:35,409
(An innocent will be crucified
instead of the sinner.)

659
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:55,159
He's young, but evil.

660
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,860
You must not underestimate him.

661
00:59:57,030 --> 00:59:58,530
If you don't want to die horribly.

662
00:59:58,900 --> 01:00:00,070
Dong Baek has a deep resentment...

663
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:01,670
against Shimbae City
since 20 years ago.

664
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:04,110
As of this moment,
Dong Baek is the prime suspect.

665
01:00:04,110 --> 01:00:05,409
Did you kill Park Gi Dan?

666
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:07,739
I wanted to ask before
I took his life.

667
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:10,380
How it felt to be paid back
the same way.

668
01:00:10,909 --> 01:00:13,610
I'm certain the Eraser
has a big picture in his head.

669
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:16,050
There's another evil being
who was behind...

670
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:17,519
all the scattered cases?

671
01:00:18,019 --> 01:00:19,789
He's here to kill his next target.
