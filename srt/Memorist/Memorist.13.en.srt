5
00:00:56,429 --> 00:01:00,130
(Evening of April 20, 2000)

6
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,530
(An abandoned factory
in Shimbae City)

7
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,569
If you stay quiet,
I'll let you speak.

8
00:01:22,090 --> 00:01:25,290
How dare you abduct
an incumbent police chief?

9
00:01:27,189 --> 00:01:28,530
Did Kim Joo Kyung
put you up to this?

10
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:29,730
No.

11
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:31,859
Then...

12
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,000
was it Hwang Jung Moon?

13
00:01:34,099 --> 00:01:36,370
You'll be dead
by the end of tonight.

14
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,840
- What?
- I don't know anything either.

15
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,109
My memory has been erased.

16
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:47,049
All that I know is that
you have become his target as well.

17
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,049
Whose?

18
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,079
The little devil.

19
00:01:55,319 --> 00:01:57,390
- Who are you?
- He may be young, but he's a devil.

20
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:01,959
I'm only doing this
to protect my daughter.

21
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:06,400
But then again, my memory
will be erased again soon.

22
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:10,539
Let's get out of here.
Untie me first...

23
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,240
and let's find a way...

24
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,009
He's here.

25
00:02:29,789 --> 00:02:31,389
Don't underestimate him...

26
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,060
unless you want to die
a gruesome death.

27
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,000
What did you do to Sang Ah?

28
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,009
I did everything you told me to do.

29
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,280
I'll kill you.

30
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:05,460
There's a party?

31
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,590
Gosh, why so late?

32
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,469
Who are you?

33
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,699
Hey. Hey.

34
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,600
Are you okay?

35
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,439
Hey!

36
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:35,910
Hey, are you okay?

37
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,180
It was you.

38
00:06:16,750 --> 00:06:17,920
Don't lie.

39
00:06:20,019 --> 00:06:22,149
The person who killed
seven people in Shimbae City...

40
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,720
20 years ago.

41
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,490
No... No.

42
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:33,300
No... No, it's not me!

43
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,569
The murderer... The Eraser...

44
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:47,009
It's you.

45
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,139
Do you have proof?

46
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,879
Everyone he has hated...

47
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,350
was killed by the Eraser.

48
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:25,779
Park Gi Dan.

49
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:28,949
Oh Yeon Tak.

50
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,889
Cho Sung Dong.

51
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,790
No.

52
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,629
You were the first one
to identify Yeom Hwa Ran...

53
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:45,839
Choi Won Young and Yeon Mi Ji.
These psychopaths...

54
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,740
killed this poor girl.
And you grew up with her...

55
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:51,439
in the same orphanage.

56
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,209
(Kim Song Hee)

57
00:07:58,579 --> 00:07:59,850
Don't spew nonsense.

58
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,519
You were the one who told
Cheon Ki Soo...

59
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,290
to cover up the murder case
20 years ago.

60
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:09,660
I have no idea
what you're talking about,

61
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:11,930
but it doesn't sound
too impressive...

62
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,730
for a killer to say.

63
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:15,129
Tell me.

64
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,569
Who told you to cover up
Moon Yong Dae's murder case?

65
00:08:23,009 --> 00:08:26,040
Why? Are you going to commit
another murder?

66
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,649
I can just scan you.

67
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:29,910
- Stop right there!
- Stop!

68
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:34,389
- Arrest him.
- Put down your guns.

69
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,720
We're investigating Deputy Chief
Lee Shin Woong for corruption.

70
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,820
He's a killer.

71
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,659
- Stop it.
- Shoot him if he tries anything.

72
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,370
Did you think
you'd get away with that?

73
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,779
Even if I made a mistake
back then,

74
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,850
the statute of limitations
has expired now.

75
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,519
A mistake?

76
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:10,990
An innocent, young man's murder
was disguised as a suicide,

77
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:12,590
and you call that a mistake?

78
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:20,259
I'm dealing with a murderer
in a rightful way.

79
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:23,629
You have no right to say otherwise.

80
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,370
Gosh, what a fool.

81
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:32,480
The murderer was right before you.
I even gave you hints.

82
00:09:33,179 --> 00:09:35,210
Because it's your job...

83
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:38,549
to fill in the blanks.

84
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:39,720
No, sir.

85
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,590
I've known for some time now...

86
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:43,250
about Det. Dong's connections
with the victims.

87
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:45,789
- What?
- I also knew that you wanted...

88
00:09:45,789 --> 00:09:47,759
to get rid of him
without getting involved.

89
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:52,960
And now, I finally know the motive.

90
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,070
You just wanted to cover up
your own crime.

91
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,990
You knew he was the killer,
yet you kept that a secret?

92
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:15,850
Do you have proof?

93
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:18,519
All the victims were those
whom he hated.

94
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:21,590
At the very least,
he's the Eraser's accomplice.

95
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,059
What about Cheon Ki Soo's son
and Mr. Noh?

96
00:10:23,059 --> 00:10:24,100
Them too.

97
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,960
Baek has a grudge
against the Shimbae incident...

98
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,570
that happened 20 years ago.

99
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:30,100
No, that's what you'd like
to believe.

100
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,539
You want to get rid of him
since he found out...

101
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,240
that you covered up
Moon Yong Dae's murder...

102
00:10:34,669 --> 00:10:36,669
and the Shimbae incident.

103
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,889
You'll have to kill at least
one more person...

104
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:52,690
if you want to keep it
a secret forever.

105
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,690
(7 years ago)

106
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:29,730
(3 days
since Seol Meadow's disappearance)

107
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,830
- Candidate number one, Ko Hyun A
- Candidate number one, Ko Hyun A

108
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,629
- Ko Hyun A, Ko Hyun A
- Ko Hyun A, Ko Hyun A

109
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,669
- Ko Hyun A, Ko Hyun A
- Hello, I'm Ko Hyun A.

110
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:41,669
- Candidate number one, Ko Hyun A
- Candidate number one, Ko Hyun A

- Ko Hyun A, Ko Hyun A
- Ko Hyun A, Ko Hyun A

112
00:11:48,809 --> 00:11:51,320
- Candidate number one, Ko Hyun A
- Candidate number one, Ko Hyun A

113
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,320
- Ko Hyun A, Ko Hyun A
- Ko Hyun A, Ko Hyun A

114
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
- Candidate number one, Ko Hyun A
- Hello, I'm...

115
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:05,929
- Sir.
- What are you doing?

116
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,929
- Let go.
- You shouldn't do this.

117
00:12:07,929 --> 00:12:09,470
Let go, please.

118
00:12:10,669 --> 00:12:11,740
Ma'am!

119
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:05,720
(Episode 13:
The Name of the Prophecy)

120
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,889
(2013)

121
00:13:08,889 --> 00:13:10,860
A 20-year-old man
who was standing trial...

122
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:13,659
has claimed to have
supernatural powers.

123
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,570
He made an absurd claim...

124
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,100
that he could read
people's memory...

125
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,539
just by physical touch.

126
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:21,840
Yesterday morning, a trial regarding
Assembly Ko Hyun A's assault...

127
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:24,210
took place at a district court
in South Gyeonggi Province.

128
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:28,049
Dong, the defendant,
claimed to have supernatural powers.

129
00:13:28,679 --> 00:13:31,419
He baffled the court by claiming
that he could read...

130
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:33,279
people's memory
solely through physical touch.

131
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,990
Contrary to everyone's expectations,
the justice department...

132
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,919
seems to believe his words...

133
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,190
and has closed off
the trial from the public.

134
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,929
Rumor has it...

135
00:13:43,929 --> 00:13:45,960
that even the NIS
had gotten involved...

136
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,730
since the beginning of the trial...

137
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:50,230
in order to verify his claim.

138
00:13:54,169 --> 00:13:57,309
All of these factors
seem to support...

139
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:00,139
Dong's claim regarding
having supernatural powers,

140
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:03,009
and the public has become
more and more interested.

141
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:14,259
We found that warning note
inside the firefighter's nostril.

142
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,629
"An innocent will be crucified..."

143
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:19,929
"instead of the sinner."

144
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,629
Dong Baek and Ms. Han Sun Mi...

145
00:14:22,629 --> 00:14:25,169
are investigating a case
involving the firefighter's wife.

146
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,039
We believe the Eraser
was after the firefighter...

147
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,740
because of his wife
who was a doctor.

148
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,179
He's after innocent family members?

149
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:33,679
My son is still inside!

150
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:34,980
Jun Young!

151
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:39,419
Move my family to our safe house.

152
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:40,720
Sorry?

153
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,659
Get the NIS
and the Secret Service...

154
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,090
to escort my wife
and my son immediately.

155
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,690
Yes, sir.

156
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:02,610
Dong Baek ran away last night.

157
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,009
I'll end the briefing here.

158
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,980
From this moment on,
Dong Baek will be our key suspect.

159
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,980
He will be your top priority.

160
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,149
We believe Senior Superintendent
Han Sun Mi, Captain Koo Kyung Tan,

161
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:15,090
and Constable Oh Se Hoon
will be aiding him.

162
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,759
Track and monitor them.

163
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:19,190
She was already taken off
of a case.

164
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,190
Don't make it harder for her!

165
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,429
This is absurd.

166
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:22,659
How could Dong Baek
be the Eraser's accomplice?

167
00:15:22,659 --> 00:15:23,860
Don't you know him?

168
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,559
He abhors murderers.

169
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:28,129
- Am I right or wrong?
- You're right.

170
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:29,929
He does seem suspicious.

171
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,039
What did you just say?

172
00:15:33,169 --> 00:15:34,970
There's no proof,
yet you're insisting on this.

173
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,539
Who ordered you to do this?

174
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:38,139
If he refuses to be arrested,

175
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,840
you're allowed to use
any kind of force.

176
00:15:41,409 --> 00:15:42,809
Even guns?

177
00:15:43,809 --> 00:15:46,720
Sir, who gave you these orders?

178
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:49,549
Even those stupid prosecutors
wouldn't give such orders.

179
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:52,389
Dong Baek is one crazy guy.
He won't give in that easily.

180
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:53,620
And yet, you want us to use guns?

181
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:56,629
You know he has a temper.
Are you telling us to kill him?

182
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,460
- Am I right or wrong?
- You're right.

183
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:07,639
(Chief Byun Young Soo)

184
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:11,940
Show me the proof, sir.

185
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:19,220
Hey, Young Soo.
Are you refusing to obey me?

186
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,980
No, sir.
I only wish to see the proof.

187
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,490
The prosecutor didn't request
for your help...

188
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,950
when he got the arrest warrant.

189
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,519
Catch him before the prosecution
does and find proof.

190
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,559
That's your job.
Don't be impudent...

191
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:32,059
and demand to see proof!

192
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,509
(Press Policy Report)

193
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:49,350
(For Your Approval)

194
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,120
(The press' biased opinions are
tainting the police's reputation.)

195
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,590
Make the press seem hostile to him.

196
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:59,389
None of them are supporting him
as of now.

197
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:24,779
Sir.

198
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,680
Why is it raining?

199
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,789
I think it'll stop soon.
Did you track Moon Yong Gwang?

200
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,490
He vanished into thin air.
What about Cheon Ki Soo?

201
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,359
He's totally off the radar.

202
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,390
What should we do?

203
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:40,160
Like Senior Superintendent Han said,
I'll be watching Assemblyman Bang.

204
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,799
Keep searching for Moon Yong Gwang.

205
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,970
I don't know where to start.

206
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:47,299
We're running out of time. Look.

207
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:50,710
The press is out to get him.

208
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,039
("Dong Baek Is a Heinous Suspect,
Did He Deceive Everyone?")

209
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:54,140
Reporter Kang Ji Eun's agency
wrote this.

210
00:17:54,549 --> 00:17:57,009
The press won't side with Baek.

211
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,250
We're the only ones he has,
so stay awake.

212
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,650
I think I should meet
with Reporter Kang.

213
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,920
Why would you? She has no power.

214
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,089
I'll call you.

215
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:08,990
Se Hoon.

216
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,490
You're alive.

217
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,390
How did you know I was here?

218
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:49,390
Sit down.

219
00:19:51,829 --> 00:19:53,430
This feels like an interrogation.

220
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,269
That's because it is.

221
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:58,539
About what?

222
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,140
I want to know the truth about you.

223
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:04,009
You're interrogating me
in front of the murderer's desk.

224
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:08,980
What? Do you think I'm the murderer?

225
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:10,609
That too.

226
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:14,589
If I'm truly the murderer,
your fate is in my hands right now.

227
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:15,650
I told you already.

228
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:19,859
The moment I die, the footage will
be sent in realtime.

229
00:20:21,329 --> 00:20:22,430
Shall we get started?

230
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:27,930
You better be on your toes.

231
00:20:28,430 --> 00:20:29,599
If any of your answers
sound suspicious,

232
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:30,769
we'll arrest you on the spot.

233
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:33,000
I said, how did you know I was here?

234
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:35,670
Was Jin Jae Gyu really a shaman?

235
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,940
Why are you curious about that?

236
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:40,079
Because I need to know the truth
in order to answer your question.

237
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,309
What did you see in his life?

238
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:51,519
Jin Jae Gyu definitely had
the ability to see the future.

239
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,220
Did he?

240
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:56,829
It ran in his family.

241
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:02,670
(Jin Jae Gyu in 1971, 8 years old)

242
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,970
His mother...

243
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:07,000
was a shaman.

244
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:55,490
But, Jin Jae Gyu
was an ordinary boy.

245
00:21:57,619 --> 00:21:59,420
At least until he met his enemy.

246
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,079
Rip his clothes.

247
00:22:20,009 --> 00:22:22,279
Hey Hwang Pil Sun,
he's only a child.

248
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:24,150
Should I do it, then?

249
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,730
Are you laughing?

250
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,470
Two days ago, your big brother...

251
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:47,839
who went to Vietnam for the war
was killed by a Viet Cong.

252
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,980
- What?
- He died a miserable death.

253
00:22:55,910 --> 00:22:57,480
What did you just say?

254
00:22:57,849 --> 00:22:58,950
You jerk...

255
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:02,890
Yong Sik.

256
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:07,490
You should make sure
Father doesn't drink or smoke.

257
00:23:08,759 --> 00:23:10,759
Since Mother has bad knees,

258
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:13,930
you should run her errands
whenever she asks.

259
00:23:15,329 --> 00:23:16,769
As for my guitar,

260
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:20,539
please burn it and bury it with me.

261
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:26,210
Yong Sik!

262
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,539
Let's get out of here.

263
00:23:34,619 --> 00:23:35,920
Hwang Pil Sun.

264
00:23:36,819 --> 00:23:38,990
You're worse than your mother.

265
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:42,190
You will die a horrible death.

266
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:47,099
In the most unsightly way possible.

267
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:56,069
Mom!

268
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,839
Mom. Mom!

269
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,009
(For orchards and weeds)

270
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:04,640
What's the matter?

271
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:06,640
Why did you...

272
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,549
come so late?

273
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:13,319
Mom, what's the matter?

274
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:15,549
My dear Jae Gyu.

275
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:20,660
You must become a big person.

276
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:22,589
Mom.

277
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:31,470
There's rice...

278
00:25:33,069 --> 00:25:34,769
in the pot.

279
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,079
Eat it...

280
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,779
before it gets cold.

281
00:25:46,279 --> 00:25:48,650
Mom! Mom!

282
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,519
The day Jin Jae Gyu saw his ability,

283
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,089
Mom!

284
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,690
his mother died.

285
00:25:56,029 --> 00:25:57,490
Mom!

286
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,130
She drank pesticide?

287
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,329
But why is his ability so important?

288
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:03,970
What does it have to do
with you coming here?

289
00:26:06,769 --> 00:26:07,900
It was his last words.

290
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:10,569
You'll meet him again.

291
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,640
He predicted we'd meet again.

292
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:17,079
After Dong Baek disappears,
you'll find him at the altar.

293
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,519
The altar of the murderer.

294
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,690
Did you come looking for me here...

295
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:24,150
just because of what he said?

296
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:28,630
How many dying words did he say?

297
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:30,359
He told me four things.

298
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:33,660
He said the Eraser is hiding
in your past,

299
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,470
and that I would
meet you again here.

300
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:37,970
Lastly,

301
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,039
he told me to look for the meadow.

302
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:44,710
- There's still one more.
- This one was the strangest.

303
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,940
The night Park Gi Dan died,

304
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:51,680
he said someone paid a visit
to the prayer house.

305
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:54,950
None other than...

306
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,059
you.

307
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,589
I saw a revelation.

308
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:07,660
I saw him standing there.

309
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,269
Of course, I ignored it.

310
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,769
I thought he was losing his mind
as he faded away.

311
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:16,539
But, his last words became reality
and I changed my mind.

312
00:27:17,309 --> 00:27:19,240
If Jin Jae Gyu can really
predict the future,

313
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:24,079
that makes it more likely for you
to have gone to the prayer house.

314
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:29,849
Did you kill Park Gi Dan?

315
00:27:32,589 --> 00:27:33,720
I wanted to kill him.

316
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,160
I wanted to ask him how it feels
to get punished the same way...

317
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,529
before he took his last breath.

318
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,069
Yes.

319
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:46,069
It's true. I was there.

320
00:27:47,769 --> 00:27:49,109
But I went to read his memories.

321
00:27:49,809 --> 00:27:51,369
Since I was due
to get arrested anyway,

322
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,380
I wanted to reveal his crimes
to the world.

323
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,079
And?

324
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,519
I turned around and left...

325
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,390
the prayer house.

326
00:28:04,289 --> 00:28:05,490
But you went all the way there.

327
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:08,529
I was reminded...

328
00:28:10,859 --> 00:28:12,930
of an incident from a long time ago.

329
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:19,339
The window I would always look at
after Meadow disappeared.

330
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,309
That's when I realized...

331
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,109
she would never want me...

332
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,750
to act this way.

333
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,519
Meadow always wanted...

334
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:36,619
everyone to know my ability...

335
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:39,490
so that the world would
become kinder.

336
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,890
That woman named Ko Hyun A...

337
00:28:44,329 --> 00:28:46,660
was on her way back with her
secret lover after a date.

338
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:57,740
- What is it?
- What was that?

339
00:29:00,579 --> 00:29:03,210
- What now?
- Over here.

340
00:29:05,519 --> 00:29:06,819
- Hurry up.
- Hold on.

341
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,490
Darn it.

342
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,250
Please help me...

343
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,160
- She must be alive.
- Darn it.

344
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,390
Please help me...

345
00:29:21,359 --> 00:29:23,369
Gosh. What are you doing?

346
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:25,440
- What are you doing?
- Out of my way!

347
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:28,339
No. No!

348
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,670
I'm Ko Hyun A.

349
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,609
It was the day after...

350
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,779
when I met her.

351
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:37,950
Had I...

352
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,079
shook her hand then...

353
00:29:43,589 --> 00:29:45,089
Had I shook her hand...

354
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,930
And you came out
so you could convict the murderers.

355
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,769
How did you know that?

356
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:01,140
My trial record is a state secret.

357
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,039
You owe me.

358
00:30:08,009 --> 00:30:09,109
National Intelligence Service?

359
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:10,809
Good guess.

360
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,619
You knew everything,
so you were just watching me.

361
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:17,849
What now?
Are you going to arrest me?

362
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,690
No, you're not the type
to ever commit murder.

363
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,960
What I've been suspicious about...

364
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:27,460
is a split personality.

365
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,700
The evil personality
that killed 7...

366
00:30:33,339 --> 00:30:34,470
in Shimbae City 20 years ago.

367
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,470
What if your other personality
worked with an accomplice...

368
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,740
and acted as the Eraser?

369
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,750
I'm not in the mood to joke.

370
00:30:43,349 --> 00:30:46,549
I tried profiling,
and there was zero possibility.

371
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:50,519
Unless you're using a huge trick
I can't wrap my head around.

372
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,059
So?

373
00:30:56,029 --> 00:30:57,460
I trust you, Det. Dong.

374
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:58,900
No.

375
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,029
I trust my judgment.

376
00:31:01,599 --> 00:31:04,769
Is the interrogation over?

377
00:31:07,299 --> 00:31:08,299
For now.

378
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,839
I'm so thankful.

379
00:31:14,079 --> 00:31:17,380
That's why we'll work together
until we catch the Eraser.

380
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,390
In the end, what's left
is the case from Shimbae City.

381
00:31:29,759 --> 00:31:32,829
I'm certain another person
was in that warehouse.

382
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,670
They were over 170cm tall.

383
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:39,339
When the culprit killed seven people
in Shimbae City,

384
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:41,470
the young Det. Dong was there.

385
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,970
Mom.

386
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:45,309
He even killed
your mother that night.

387
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,410
You were wandering after losing
your memory when you were found.

388
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,779
Why do you think the Eraser
was called the Young Devil?

389
00:31:55,349 --> 00:31:56,690
He must have been young.

390
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,859
At the time, Moon Yong Gwang
was only 17 years old.

391
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,230
Do you think Moon Yong Gwang
is the Eraser?

392
00:32:03,230 --> 00:32:05,960
The Eraser must have an ill
relationship with your family,

393
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,599
and he also killed seven people.

394
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,970
But two months before
the incident happened,

395
00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:12,400
Moon Yong Gwang's big brother
was killed mysteriously.

396
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:15,609
Did he avenge his brother because
those seven were responsible?

397
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,309
By becoming the Eraser?

398
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:20,680
Even if he's not the Eraser,
the two of them are accomplices.

399
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,210
How so?

400
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:25,279
If I was the Eraser,
I would make sure to keep...

401
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,720
a good card like Moon Yong Gwang
with me.

402
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:28,420
It's similar to the way
he used Jin Jae Gyu.

403
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:32,460
Then why did Moon Yong Gwang leak
Deputy Chief Lee's information?

404
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,759
To confuse us?

405
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,130
I'm sure Eraser
has a bigger picture.

406
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:42,269
We don't know
his ultimate objective yet.

407
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,670
"His ultimate objective"?

408
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,599
The one
who instigated Lee Shin Woong.

409
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:50,569
So there's an evildoer
who instigated the scattered cases?

410
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:52,609
And that's the ultimate objective
of the Eraser?

411
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:56,549
Then we have the answer.
We either strike Lee Shin Woong...

412
00:32:56,549 --> 00:32:59,250
or crack Moon Yong Gwang
who's the Eraser's accomplice.

413
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,349
What should we do first?

414
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,990
You should stay out of it.
It's on me now.

415
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,519
- What?
- You might end up dead.

416
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,960
Did Professor Ahn talk again?

417
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,400
My condition is a national secret.

418
00:33:12,829 --> 00:33:15,029
She tends to overact.

419
00:33:19,339 --> 00:33:22,769
Rest here. It's not wiretapped,
so keep it on.

420
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:25,710
Are you going to chase clues
without me?

421
00:33:27,009 --> 00:33:28,480
You'll only get in the way
in your current condition.

422
00:33:32,819 --> 00:33:34,250
This is my fight.

423
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,519
I can't stop even if it kills me.

424
00:33:40,589 --> 00:33:42,160
I have a lead...

425
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:44,660
on the one
who's helping Moon Yong Gwang.

426
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:47,630
Who is it?

427
00:33:49,299 --> 00:33:50,900
Wait, that's wiretapped.

428
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,000
It's on airplane mode.

429
00:33:57,009 --> 00:33:58,309
When did you take this?

430
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:02,180
- You might die.
- Mr. Moon.

431
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:03,410
What do you find strange?

432
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,280
Please help me.

433
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,929
She moved first.

434
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:39,179
Yes, Senior Superintendent Han.

435
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,519
It's me, Old Man.

436
00:34:40,519 --> 00:34:42,050
Hey, where were you hiding?

437
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,820
Senior Superintendent Han
was worried.

438
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,849
Where's Seo Yi Soo?

439
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:46,389
At Bang Jun Seok's.

440
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,260
We'll be right there, so keep
watching her. Where's Se Hoon?

441
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:50,659
He's not here.

442
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,800
- Why not?
- He's trying to save you.

443
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,230
What do you mean?

444
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,429
What do you think? He's trying
to be a good partner to you.

445
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,139
("Dong Baek Suspected
to Be a Serial Killer")

446
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:03,039
This article is from us.

447
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,179
You know this is not true.

448
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:10,179
I'm sorry.

449
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:14,050
I'm not asking you to sugarcoat it.
We just want you to write the truth.

450
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:17,449
Can't you just write about Dong Baek
as he is?

451
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,219
I have no excuses.

452
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:30,570
Det. Oh.

453
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:40,579
- The day I got appointed,
- Thank you for the food!

454
00:35:41,079 --> 00:35:42,210
Enjoy.

455
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:44,250
I saw Baek for the first time.

456
00:35:46,349 --> 00:35:49,119
Gosh, this month has been so busy.

457
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,190
I know, right?

458
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,789
I suddenly got a strange feeling.

459
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:53,820
- The noodles are good.
- We should check that.

460
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,889
What kind of feeling?

461
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,630
He looked lonely.

462
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,460
We should do it before then.

463
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:07,670
Salute.

464
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,510
It's an honor to meet you.

465
00:36:10,739 --> 00:36:12,280
May I ask for a handshake?

466
00:36:16,809 --> 00:36:17,909
Yes.

467
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:25,349
Constable Oh Se Hoon.

468
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,019
What?

469
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,539
Gosh.

470
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:43,110
People talked behind our backs
and called us crazy,

471
00:36:43,909 --> 00:36:45,010
but I...

472
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:49,110
just felt sorry for Baek.

473
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:56,750
Hey. You can have all of these.

474
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,860
Really? Thank you!

475
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:09,030
He wouldn't let anyone
get close to him.

476
00:37:10,699 --> 00:37:14,599
But he gave you so much love.

477
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:18,170
Do you know why Baek
started to act like a celebrity?

478
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:26,679
I can't say he wasn't
narcissistic before,

479
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,659
but it's because of
the criminals' memories.

480
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,320
The criminals?

481
00:37:37,829 --> 00:37:39,429
Evil memories...

482
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,300
can't be erased easily...

483
00:37:43,829 --> 00:37:45,599
once they're read.

484
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:50,239
The pains of the victims
that Baek read...

485
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:54,539
can be consoled a little bit
when the culprit is caught.

486
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,710
But the memories of the criminals
are the opposite.

487
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,219
They only get clearer.

488
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:06,489
Whenever that happened,
people's love...

489
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,860
was the only thing
that helped him stay strong.

490
00:38:09,489 --> 00:38:11,659
- Hello.
- You're here.

491
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:13,929
- I'm her dad.
- I see.

492
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:15,199
Thank you so much.

493
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:19,469
If it wasn't for you,
it would've been hard on her.

494
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:21,639
You should hurry and thank him.

495
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,840
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

496
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:26,079
I made these macarons.

497
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:28,739
They cried while thanking him
for catching the criminal.

498
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,010
Thank you.

499
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:35,550
Letters from the victims' families
cheered him up.

500
00:38:39,619 --> 00:38:42,360
He may seem like he's always
dressing up and boasting,

501
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:48,460
but he was struggling by himself
as he was rotting inside.

502
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:58,309
I was called by
the disciplinary committee too.

503
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,409
But, I don't mind.

504
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,219
I can't even protect my partner,
so how can I protect the country?

505
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,250
If something happens to Baek,

506
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:13,559
I'll quit my job.

507
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,889
Even if I get expelled,

508
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,929
I'll make sure to stay by his side.

509
00:39:27,469 --> 00:39:28,800
Thank you for your time.

510
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:01,570
Seo Yi Soo hasn't come out
after going into the house.

511
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,539
You haven't found Cheon Ki Soo
or Moon Yong Gwang?

512
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,369
I'll start looking again.

513
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:07,940
No, the RIU is chasing them as well.

514
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:10,780
I want you to keep your eyes
on Deputy Chief Lee's family.

515
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:12,519
"Deputy Chief Lee's family"?

516
00:40:13,449 --> 00:40:16,750
The Eraser is killing the families
related to the Shimbae case.

517
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,260
He'll target Mr. Lee's family too.

518
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:20,659
Why?

519
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:22,659
Mr. Lee is the one who covered up
Moon Yong Dae's murder.

520
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:24,090
Murder?

521
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,559
The seven that died
in the warehouse...

522
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,159
were murderers who killed
Moon Yong Dae.

523
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:30,670
- Are you sure?
- Moon Yong Dae died right before...

524
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:31,869
those seven died.

525
00:40:31,869 --> 00:40:34,670
Also, there's a link between
those two cases.

526
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:36,070
- Who? Mr. Lee?
- No.

527
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:38,139
Cheon Ki Soo.

528
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,579
Cheon Ki Soo bribed a doctor...

529
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:42,409
and fabricated Moon Yong Dae's death
as a suicide...

530
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:43,849
when he was murdered in Shimbae.

531
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,380
Also, he covered up the
massacre case that occurred...

532
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,519
in the warehouse in Shimbae.

533
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,449
I have a headache.

534
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:52,219
But that's not enough
to connect everything.

535
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:53,820
The night those seven men died,

536
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,429
Mr. Lee was held captured
inside that warehouse.

537
00:40:57,059 --> 00:40:59,800
He was fated to die in the Eraser's
hands but managed to escape.

538
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,829
Cheon Ki Soo already received
disciplinary action...

539
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:03,699
due to bribery 20 years ago,

540
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,969
but his career bloomed after that
and was even promoted.

541
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,769
So Mr. Lee was backing him.

542
00:41:09,909 --> 00:41:11,440
They're on the same boat.

543
00:41:11,539 --> 00:41:15,239
So, seven men from a wealthy family
killed Moon Yong Dae,

544
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:17,510
and Mr. Lee ordered Cheon Ki Soo
to cover up the case.

545
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:20,050
But Moon Yong Dae's brother
Moon Yong Gwang found out...

546
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:22,519
and killed all seven men
who killed his brother.

547
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:25,920
But even now after 20 years,
he is still in rage...

548
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:28,190
and became the Eraser...

549
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:31,090
to hurt Mr. Lee and
Cheon Ki Soo's family?

550
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,460
Even if Moon Yong Gwang isn't
the Eraser, they are together.

551
00:41:35,699 --> 00:41:37,570
But why are you going to meet
Seo Yi Soo?

552
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:39,070
You need to catch Moon Yong Gwang.

553
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:41,769
She's our shortcut to catching
Moon Yong Gwang.

554
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,940
"Shortcut"?

555
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:45,340
Old Man, go to Mr. Lee's house
with Se Hoon.

556
00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:47,280
I'm sure the Eraser will come
near his family.

557
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,780
All right. Oh, boy. Good luck.

558
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,829
Where is Moon Yong Gwang?

559
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,099
How would I know?

560
00:42:20,110 --> 00:42:22,110
- What are you doing?
- Put it down!

561
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,219
You moved first.

562
00:42:28,250 --> 00:42:31,889
Your feet moved toward the stairs
first, so he could escape.

563
00:42:35,659 --> 00:42:36,789
Are you in a relationship?

564
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:40,730
I have nothing to do with him.

565
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:42,869
Moon Yong Gwang merely used you.

566
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,139
No.

567
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:48,099
He's not that type of person.

568
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:50,539
No way.

569
00:42:50,539 --> 00:42:51,969
He used you
because his purpose is murder.

570
00:42:57,309 --> 00:42:58,579
You know something.

571
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:00,880
What is it?

572
00:43:03,389 --> 00:43:06,260
Moon Yong Gwang is searching for
people to kill for his revenge.

573
00:43:07,219 --> 00:43:08,719
Now's the only chance to stop him.

574
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,429
Where is he hiding?

575
00:43:11,159 --> 00:43:12,460
We don't have time.

576
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:19,739
At a resort.

577
00:43:20,869 --> 00:43:21,900
Resort?

578
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,489
Please save Yong Gwang.

579
00:43:41,389 --> 00:43:42,460
Please.

580
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:58,670
Wait.

581
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:04,780
Dispatch your men
at the back like last time.

582
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:06,619
They're from the
Intelligence Agency.

583
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:10,090
- Intelligence Agency?
- Lee Shin Woong's henchmen.

584
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,230
When I assaulted Choi Poong Won,

585
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,099
he was the one who shot the video.

586
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,039
In order to get rid of you.

587
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:29,170
They know Moon Yong Gwang is hiding.

588
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:40,449
No.

589
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,750
Moon Yong Gwang didn't come here
to hide.

590
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:48,159
He came to kill his next target.

591
00:45:01,469 --> 00:45:03,840
- How's the security status?
- We've closed the whole floor.

592
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,869
What about the secure room
in the basement?

593
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:07,440
2 agents from intelligence
and 2 guards are watching it.

594
00:45:08,210 --> 00:45:09,480
Double your men.

595
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:11,750
And don't let any outside lines
connect to the security cameras.

596
00:45:11,849 --> 00:45:14,179
- They might get hacked.
- Yes, sir.

597
00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:18,389
Stop playing with your phone.

598
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:21,260
Dad, it feels so stuffy in here.

599
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,289
What is going on?

600
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:24,590
Wait.

601
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:27,429
(Restricted Number)

602
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,530
Yes?

603
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:32,400
The Eraser will target your family.

604
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:37,539
What?

605
00:45:37,539 --> 00:45:39,739
His next target is you,
who bribed Cheon Ki Soo.

606
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:48,420
Did Dong Baek say I would die next?

607
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:50,420
You need to cooperate
if you want to protect your family.

608
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:54,760
Han Sun Mi, you still don't know,
do you?

609
00:45:55,190 --> 00:45:57,489
The standard of proving
how properly...

610
00:45:57,690 --> 00:45:59,460
a person has lived his life.

611
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,630
That's the amount of power
he can mobilize...

612
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:05,800
in order to protect his own people.

613
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,710
I will protect my family
with my own power.

614
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:15,179
Sir.

615
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:07,730
The Eraser will come here.

616
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:14,739
He's the Eraser.
Who do you mean?

617
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:16,440
Oh, his accomplice?

618
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:20,139
Cuff him and lock him up
in the next room.

619
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:21,880
I'll interrogate him
after catching Moon Yong Gwang.

620
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,980
- Yes, sir.
- You'll regret it.

621
00:47:24,949 --> 00:47:26,010
The lights!

622
00:47:29,789 --> 00:47:30,889
What's going on in the hallway?

623
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:31,920
We're checking.

624
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,940
What's going on?

625
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,769
- He's here.
- He came sooner than we thought.

626
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:42,849
He prepared gas.

627
00:49:43,489 --> 00:49:44,550
Gas?

628
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:46,150
Gas that's used for surgery.

629
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:47,590
Sleeping gas.

630
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,570
You can't scan him.

631
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:16,079
Baek.

632
00:51:17,309 --> 00:51:18,409
Baek.

633
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:20,179
Baek.

634
00:51:21,079 --> 00:51:22,119
Baek!

635
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:25,420
Are you awake?

636
00:51:30,829 --> 00:51:33,730
What? Wait, what happened?

637
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:34,900
What do you think?

638
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,670
My successful retirement
has gone down the drain.

639
00:51:37,199 --> 00:51:39,269
Captain Koo intercepted you guys.

640
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:55,619
Hey, wait. Stop!

641
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:57,050
Stop!

642
00:51:57,050 --> 00:51:58,050
What?

643
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:04,429
- They escaped?
- I'm sorry, sir. I woke up late.

644
00:52:13,940 --> 00:52:14,969
What about Moon Yong Gwang?

645
00:52:15,369 --> 00:52:17,139
He's being transferred
to a hospital currently.

646
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,210
Dispatch all emergency units...

647
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:24,610
and call back all your men
who went to the hospital.

648
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,150
Yes, sir.

649
00:52:26,449 --> 00:52:29,380
We'll interrogate
Moon Yong Gwang first.

650
00:52:29,420 --> 00:52:30,489
Yes, sir.

651
00:52:35,019 --> 00:52:36,630
They weren't on the same side?

652
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,630
No, let's tighten
the security first.

653
00:52:43,130 --> 00:52:44,170
It's a trick.

654
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:48,670
We have to go back.
Get in. Come on, hurry!

655
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:07,789
You have to leave.

656
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,489
Hey.

657
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:15,599
Mister.

658
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,869
Look here.

659
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,079
Freeze.

660
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:56,300
Where on earth are you?

661
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:58,539
- Moon Yong Gwang was bait.
- What?

662
00:53:58,570 --> 00:54:00,480
The Eraser will kill your son!

663
00:54:16,159 --> 00:54:19,190
No!

664
00:54:37,849 --> 00:54:40,280
Mr. Lee's son is down.
Seal off the whole building.

665
00:54:40,449 --> 00:54:42,519
You have permission to shoot
the suspect.

666
00:54:42,519 --> 00:54:44,449
- Capture or kill at all costs.
- Wait.

667
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:47,789
You have permission to shoot
Dong Baek or the Eraser.

668
00:55:00,139 --> 00:55:01,199
No...

669
00:55:02,739 --> 00:55:05,739
Will our son be okay?

670
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:09,780
How could this... What do we do?

671
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:29,429
He's still in surgery,
but he's passed the critical stage.

672
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:32,699
Luckily, his pressure points
weren't pierced.

673
00:55:35,739 --> 00:55:36,739
"Luckily?"

674
00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:41,409
12 nails were driven into
my son's body.

675
00:55:47,019 --> 00:55:48,219
"Luckily?"

676
00:55:51,889 --> 00:55:53,250
If my son dies,

677
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:56,619
you will die too.

678
00:55:57,659 --> 00:55:58,829
I'll put my life on the line...

679
00:55:59,659 --> 00:56:00,730
to find him.

680
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:11,769
The main culprit was someone else.

681
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,449
The men who killed Moon Yong Dae.

682
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:27,719
It wasn't seven...

683
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,130
but eight people in total.

684
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:41,739
Bang Jun Seok.

685
00:56:43,769 --> 00:56:45,210
The puzzle has been solved.

686
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,920
Reporter Kang,
what are you doing here?

687
00:56:59,019 --> 00:57:00,289
Didn't you hear me?

688
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:04,289
Why? Is it wrong for a reporter
to be at a broadcasting station?

689
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,829
I won't follow any of your
unfair orders anymore.

690
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:13,429
What are you talking about?
It's a total mess right now.

691
00:57:26,849 --> 00:57:28,550
(Former Assemblyman
Bang Jun Seok's wife kidnapped...)

692
00:57:28,550 --> 00:57:29,550
(with murder threat)

693
00:57:30,019 --> 00:57:31,190
What's going on?

694
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:53,880
Please wait here.

695
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:03,349
Former assemblyman Bang Jun Seok's
wife, Eun Soo Gyeong...

696
00:58:03,349 --> 00:58:05,519
has been abducted
by an unidentified man.

697
00:58:05,989 --> 00:58:09,090
The abductor has sent us
a picture of Eun Soo Gyeong...

698
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,889
holding a sign that implies
a murder will take place soon.

699
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:13,900
Let's hear Reporter Gong's
exclusive report.

700
00:58:20,900 --> 00:58:22,039
Please...

701
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,239
I'm six months pregnant.

702
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:28,840
It's okay for me to die,
but please...

703
00:58:29,909 --> 00:58:31,150
spare my child.

704
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:54,440
Detective Dong.

705
00:58:56,340 --> 00:58:58,440
Please save my daughter Soo Gyeong.

706
00:58:59,610 --> 00:59:01,239
Please. Please...

707
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:03,780
(Jeon Woo Jung)

708
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,679
It's not my daughter's fault.

709
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:10,250
- You can save her.
- Please get up, ma'am.

710
00:59:10,690 --> 00:59:13,250
You can save her!

711
00:59:17,789 --> 00:59:18,960
Soo Gyeong is...

712
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,400
your fan.

713
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:25,500
She likes you so much.

714
00:59:25,969 --> 00:59:28,239
She even followed
all your news reports.

715
00:59:29,639 --> 00:59:31,969
Please... I beg of you.

716
00:59:32,340 --> 00:59:35,409
Please save Soo Gyeong and Meadow.

717
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:39,010
Who?

718
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:41,920
- Meadow?
- You should go.

719
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,050
Meadow...

720
00:59:43,949 --> 00:59:48,389
It's the birth name
of Soo Gyeong's baby.

721
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:50,829
You must find...

722
00:59:51,929 --> 00:59:53,190
No matter what...

723
00:59:55,199 --> 00:59:56,360
Meadow...

724
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:00,969
Please save my daughter.

725
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:03,599
You need to save my daughter.

726
01:00:03,739 --> 01:00:06,639
- Please save my daughter!
- You need to leave.

727
01:00:06,739 --> 01:00:08,239
- Ma'am, please.
- My daughter.

728
01:00:08,409 --> 01:00:10,309
Please save my daughter!

729
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,420
There was someone else.

730
01:00:48,219 --> 01:00:50,719
- What?
- The root of every evil deed.

731
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,219
It wasn't Bang Jun Seok.

732
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:56,989
What...

733
01:00:56,989 --> 01:00:58,829
The link to all the scattered cases.

734
01:01:03,329 --> 01:01:05,630
The one who fabricated
Moon Yong Dae's death.

735
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,650
The Eraser's final objective.

736
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:33,329
You brat!

737
01:01:41,199 --> 01:01:43,070
The one who killed
Jin Jae Gyu's mom...

738
01:01:50,550 --> 01:01:52,409
and destroyed his life.

739
01:02:32,349 --> 01:02:33,489
His half-sister.

740
01:03:18,030 --> 01:03:20,230
What kind of resent
does the Eraser have?

741
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:23,369
She appeared after
using Moon Yong Gwang as bait.

742
01:03:24,170 --> 01:03:26,840
Your son...
This is just the beginning.

743
01:03:27,139 --> 01:03:29,980
- The cause of this whole tragedy.
- The clue lies in there.

744
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:32,510
The one who goes after
Mr. Bang is the Eraser.

745
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:37,219
Anyone who becomes a threat
to Assemblyman Bang must all die.

746
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:40,960
Catch him. Mobilize all your men.

747
01:03:41,289 --> 01:03:42,420
Give him a chance.

748
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:45,090
A chance for Det. Dong
to find the smoking gun.
