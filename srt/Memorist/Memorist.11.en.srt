It's him.
Don't hesitate and shoot him!

if I die. Shoot him now!

Despite being murdered
while in police custody,

100
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:10,509
the police have failed
to identify the killer...

00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:13,750
or find any leads.

102
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:16,220
The late Jin Jae Gyu was suspected
of being the Executioner...

103
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,059
who committed the serial killings
that happened 20 years ago.

104
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:22,789
He had harmed himself yesterday
in court...

105

while his warrant
was being verified.

106

While admitted to hospital,
he lost his life.

107
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,629
There have only been speculations
that he had murdered six victims,

108
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,769
including Park Gi Dan,
the cult leader,

109

and Cho Sung Dong,
the former president of TBC.

There has been no solid evidence
to support this.

The killer,
who's also known as the Eraser,

was once suspected
of being Jin's accomplice.

this morning,

the police have perplexed
the reporters...

122
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:12,679
by saying that Jin's murderer,
the Eraser, could have superpowers.

- Superpowers?

I knew it.

126
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,080
Did they go back on their words
once again?

127
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:21,450
How many times has it been?

128

I'd be surprised if they end up
catching the killer.

165
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,970
You do remember
that I warned you, right?

166
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,529
What are you doing?

167
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,100
Hello, Deputy Chief Lee Shin Woong.

168
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:23,809
We finally get to meet.

169
00:13:24,539 --> 00:13:26,909
What brings you here,
Chief Prosecutor Woo Seok Do?

170
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,350
I feel greatly honored...

171
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,950
to be recognized after being
looked down upon...

172
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,580
by a bunch of small fry.

173
00:13:34,789 --> 00:13:37,450
Of course. You'll be the next
Public Prosecutor General.

174
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:38,789
You were promoted and transferred...

175
00:13:38,789 --> 00:13:39,990
to Central District
Prosecutor's Office.

176
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,460
Amidst
District Attorney Lim's scandal,

177
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,200
you remained safe and sound.

178
00:13:46,629 --> 00:13:48,700
I forgot to bring your warrant.

179
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,470
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes, sir.

180
00:13:50,629 --> 00:13:52,000
Go to the court
and request another warrant.

181
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'd like to search
the deputy chief's office.

182
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,470
What are you doing?

183
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:58,940
- Shall we talk in my office?
- Why? Are you scared?

184
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,480
How dare you talk like that to...

185
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:05,049
I do respect how determined you are.

186
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:07,750
But you should be more dignified.

187
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,289
The prosecution doesn't care
about showing dignity...

188
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:12,960
in front of you, suspects.

189
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:15,990
Sir, you shouldn't deal
with someone as lowly as him.

190
00:14:16,059 --> 00:14:17,830
- "Lowly"?
- I'd like to make a bet...

191
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,460
that you'll leave empty-handed...

192
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,529
Are you trying to be funny?

193
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,740
I heard that you were present...

194
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,909
during Detective Dong's arrest.

195
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,240
- Move aside!
- Wait!

196
00:14:32,679 --> 00:14:34,250
- We have no time for...
- Gosh.

197
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,980
So what?

198
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,980
I'm sure you know
what the problem is.

199
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,590
Beats me.

200
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,149
I won't hold you responsible for it
if you leave.

201
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:45,789
I'm afraid I can't do that.

202
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:47,860
Send him the documents
that he needs later.

203
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:50,429
- Yes, sir.
- You're quite humorous.

204
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:51,929
So you'll take responsibility,
is that it?

205
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:56,299
You assaulted a suspect.

206
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:58,970
(Assaulting a suspect could result
in up to 5 years in jail.)

207
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,169
Do you have proof?

208
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,009
Shall we bet?

209
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:04,909
Let's see if I'm just bluffing
without any evidence...

210
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:08,610
or if I have a high-resolution video
to prove it.

211
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:10,480
I doubt that you have one.

212
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,590
But even if you do,
it won't work against me.

213
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,460
You're right.
Prosecutors are the only ones...

214
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,090
who have the right
to indict an individual.

215
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:25,600
But if that video
were to be aired on the news,

216
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:29,029
you may not be indicted,

217
00:15:29,529 --> 00:15:31,269
but you'll have to step down.

218
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,940
We all know
that scandalous prosecutors...

219
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:37,169
always end up
opening their own practice.

220
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,009
Are you challenging me?

221
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,649
Let's make a bet...

222
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:45,649
whether you'll leave quietly...

223
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,820
or put up a fight.

224
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,200
Let's pull out.

225
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,639
Sir?

226
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,610
- Pack it up.
- Yes, sir.

227
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,379
The rumors about you were right.

228
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:18,580
We'll be seeing each other soon.

229
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,100
I'm sorry.

230
00:16:34,629 --> 00:16:36,000
Hand in your resignation letter...

231
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,970
and go to the Prosecutors' Office.

232
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,309
I will, but please give me
a week to investigate.

233
00:16:41,309 --> 00:16:43,070
- Even four days will be...
- Han Sun Mi.

234
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,309
- Yes, sir.
- Do you know...

235
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:48,649
the number-one reason why soldiers
die the most on the battlefield?

236
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,220
It's because of foolish leaders...

237
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:55,950
like you.

238
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:59,960
The RIU was humiliated
thanks to you.

239
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:01,789
No, the entire police force
was humiliated.

240
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:03,860
And yet, you still want to continue?

241
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:06,829
You'll still be a lawyer
even if you step down,

242
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,329
but that's not the case
for the others.

243
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:13,099
It's my duty to help them
feed their families.

244
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,240
If you still refuse to let go,

245
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:21,150
Young Soo will get fired as well.
Is that what you want?

246
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:22,480
No, sir.

247
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,309
Then do...

248
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,319
what's right.

249
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,589
You're late.

250
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,099
You read my passcode?

251
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,640
What else did you read
from my memory?

252
00:19:25,869 --> 00:19:27,339
What do you take me for?

253
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,710
The four keys were covered
with your prints.

254
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:32,140
What kind of a profiler
is this clumsy?

255
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,980
Stop frowning, will you?

256
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,549
I was just worried
that the Eraser would come for you.

257
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:42,289
The moment I die,
everyone will know who he is.

258
00:19:43,519 --> 00:19:45,059
If you feel reassured,
you may leave.

259
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:46,990
I have nowhere to go.

260
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,190
Woo Seok Do is searching for me,

261
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:50,230
so his men are waiting at my house
and in front of hotels.

262
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,900
The killer murdered my mother.

263
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,869
I remember it clearly.

264
00:20:04,109 --> 00:20:07,380
You were crying your eyes out
as your mom took her last breath.

265
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:11,650
I don't care who dies.
I'm going to see the end of this.

266
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,289
And how exactly will you do that?

267
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:18,559
The Eraser only murdered those
who were infamous...

268
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,619
like the Executioner.

269
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:21,990
- But?
- But there was an exception.

270
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,230
Shimbae.

271
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,259
We'll find the lead
in the Shimbae incident.

272
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:30,099
We need to find out why...

273
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,470
the Eraser had to kill seven people.

274
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,210
Only then will we know the identity
of the Eraser who even had...

275
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,980
to reveal his superpower
in order to kill them.

276
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,220
I need your help.

277
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,549
I've already been kicked out
of this case...

278
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,619
because someone failed
to catch the killer.

279
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:53,390
Look who's talking.

280
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,359
I risked my life
and chased after him.

281
00:20:55,359 --> 00:20:57,230
I have only myself to blame
for trusting you.

282
00:20:57,230 --> 00:20:59,200
You and your words...
It doesn't matter.

283
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,569
It's not your authority that I need.

284
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:03,900
It's your brain.

285
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:06,539
Weren't you confident
that you were the brightest?

286
00:21:06,539 --> 00:21:08,670
Of course.
I'm as smart as Sherlock Holmes,

287
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:10,210
but you have some strengths too.

288
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,740
For example?

289
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:14,109
You possess knowledge
in criminology which I lack...

290
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:16,750
and excellent logical reasoning
thanks to your brain.

291
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:17,980
Are you admitting that I'm the best?

292
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:21,019
I'm just saying you have
both strengths and weaknesses.

293
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:27,490
Jin Jae Gyu said something to me
before he died.

294
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:30,259
What?

295
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:34,630
The Eraser is hiding...

296
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,140
in Dong Baek's past.

297
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,109
What past?

298
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,579
"Past"?

299
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,740
That's it?

300
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,109
All the leads are useless...

301
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:57,250
just like my past memories
that I've lost.

302
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:02,789
What we need to dig into
isn't my past...

303
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,230
but the Shimbae incident.

304
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,400
Do you think that's the past
the Eraser is hiding in?

305
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:11,940
If he was talking
about your mother's death,

306
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,240
then it would've been useless
since everyone knew about that.

307
00:22:15,670 --> 00:22:17,740
- But...
- "But"?

308
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,240
Judging from what I saw...

309
00:22:19,309 --> 00:22:21,240
Shoot him now! It doesn't matter
if I die. Shoot him now!

310
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:23,849
He would never say something
useless as his last words.

311
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,250
I think you're empathizing
with Jin Jae Gyu and his death.

312
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:30,019
Since the pain I caused you...

313
00:22:31,589 --> 00:22:33,089
is my karma.

314
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,230
Perhaps...

315
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:39,700
he's referring to intact memories
that didn't get erased.

316
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:44,769
The Eraser inside...

317
00:22:45,769 --> 00:22:46,970
my intact memories?

318
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:49,410
How does that make sense?

319
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:51,980
Maybe you never focused on it
because it's something common,

320
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,680
- or maybe...
- Maybe what?

321
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,549
it was too intense of a moment...

322
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,880
that you couldn't pay attention
to anything else around it.

323
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,019
The Eraser could be hiding
in such a moment.

324
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,859
A moment too intense...

325
00:23:07,859 --> 00:23:10,329
that made me miss everything else?

326
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,400
(Eight years ago)

327
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,569
A moment too intense...

328
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:25,980
that made me miss everything else...

329
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,650
That rooftop when I was 19.

330
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,289
Go do it somewhere else.

331
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,059
They say, taking your shoes off
is a message to others...

332
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,500
asking them to recognize your death.

333
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:20,829
Is that the case for you too?

334
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,900
No, I...

335
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,599
Can you do it somewhere else?
This is my spot.

336
00:24:56,869 --> 00:24:57,900
Senior Superintendent Han,

337
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:59,940
you must be having
a hard time because of Baek.

338
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:03,839
Hey, look how tired she looks
because of you.

339
00:25:04,009 --> 00:25:06,980
Gosh. He sure has a way
of getting on people's nerves.

340
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:11,380
- You didn't eat, right?
- Did anyone follow you?

341
00:25:12,849 --> 00:25:15,420
- None.
- We're professionals, you know.

342
00:25:16,289 --> 00:25:17,720
What on earth is going on?

343
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,359
What is this?
Didn't you get her permission?

344
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:25,160
I was just about to ask
when you came.

345
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:32,440
Senior Superintendent Han,
we brought some information.

346
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:36,369
Yes,
it really is something essential.

347
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:38,309
But because I'm so hungry,

348
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,839
I forgot the most important part.

349
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,210
Please excuse us.

350
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,789
This is an emergency, after all.

351
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,900
We looked through the death cases
from Shimbae City.

352
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,329
Not all of them
lived in Shimbae City,

353
00:26:03,329 --> 00:26:05,140
and they went to different
universities. Isn't it strange...

354
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:07,569
- they died at the same time?
- So?

355
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,670
We found what they have in common.

356
00:26:10,839 --> 00:26:12,740
- What is it?
- Their entrance exam tutor.

357
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:14,380
Ever since they were
in kindergarten,

358
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:18,210
they received
group tutoring only for the rich.

359
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,819
It's something the situation room
figured out already.

360
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,920
Gosh. You're right.

361
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:28,859
The families of the deceased
are all pretty influential.

362
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,859
Whenever we try to ask a question,
they won't budge.

363
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,529
- Why is that?
- I don't know.

364
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:37,670
What did you find out, then?

365
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,640
Baek, don't you find it strange?

366
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,170
Seven healthy 20-year-olds died,

367
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,509
but not a single family member
is whining about it.

368
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,009
And?

369
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:50,250
One name, in particular,
made us feel unsettled.

370
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:55,150
(Name: So Phillip)

371
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:57,990
- "So Phillip"?
- Yes.

372
00:26:58,819 --> 00:27:01,319
I realized where I've seen it.

373
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:03,589
- Where?
- Don't you remember?

374
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:07,430
You sent us to research
some cold cases.

375
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:09,130
Do you mean the archives of
Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency?

376
00:27:09,269 --> 00:27:10,299
Yes.

377
00:27:10,299 --> 00:27:12,700
It was in one of the official files
of the Special Investigation Team.

378
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,700
(Died due to asphyxiation in
Shimbae City...)

379
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,140
It's a very rare name.

380
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:17,769
"So Phillip".

381
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,740
(Special Investigation Team
for Cold Cases)

382
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,910
It doesn't make sense.

383
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:23,509
We didn't do an internal
investigation for that case.

384
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:25,920
Are you saying
the Special Investigation Team...

385
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,150
added the results
of an internal investigation?

386
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:29,319
There was an internal investigation,

387
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,460
but someone erased all the traces.

388
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,819
It's very difficult to delete...

389
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:37,059
a police record.

390
00:27:37,259 --> 00:27:39,759
I wonder what they were
worried about to have deleted it.

391
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:41,970
"Cheon Ki Soo"?

392
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:45,400
Did you say you're Kim So Mi?

393
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,500
The one from six years ago?

394
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:51,779
What a strange coincidence.

395
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,339
Cheon Ki Soo was an RIU team leader
at that time...

396
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,980
at the Gyeonggi
Provincial Police Agency.

397
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,380
- You said you know him, right?
- Yes.

398
00:27:58,619 --> 00:28:01,019
I gave him a call earlier, and he
apparently took the day off today.

399
00:28:01,019 --> 00:28:02,519
We scheduled a meeting
tomorrow morning.

400
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,849
Do you think he might be the one
who erased the records?

401
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,319
We'll find out.

402
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,690
Whatever it is, we've found
the core of the problem.

403
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:12,660
Let's see how much
this rotting water will overflow.

404
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,329
Good work.

405
00:28:15,130 --> 00:28:16,400
Gosh.

406
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,430
What about me?

407
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,599
What do you think about
a joint investigation team?

408
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,609
You can stay just for tonight.

409
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,779
We can't become "The Avengers"
without her.

410
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:44,890
Gosh.

411
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,960
Stop.

412
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:53,839
Please don't kill me.

413
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:31,880
Why are you following me around?

414
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,150
I didn't.

415
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,819
How childish.

416
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:41,049
Don't do it.

417
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,720
What?

418
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,960
You shouldn't think about
doing the extreme.

419
00:29:48,089 --> 00:29:49,160
"Doing the extreme"?

420
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,759
You make me laugh.

421
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:56,769
I'm not a pretentious person
like you who makes suicide attempts.

422
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:58,900
Stop following me around and leave.

423
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,339
I know you went up there
multiple times too.

424
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,440
What?

425
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,339
To die.

426
00:30:10,079 --> 00:30:11,180
Did you see me?

427
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,619
I read your memories.

428
00:30:19,789 --> 00:30:22,559
You're really ridiculous,
although you don't look crazy.

429
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,359
You should make your moves
on someone from your own school.

430
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,730
I know you were abused.

431
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,099
What?

432
00:30:33,099 --> 00:30:35,099
You were rescued and adopted
just before you were killed.

433
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,940
You're still overwhelmed
by those memories.

434
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,650
Who said such a thing?

435
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,069
Baek.

436
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,809
Baek! Baek.

437
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:10,670
Hurry and get up.

438
00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:14,410
- What?
- Cheon Ki Soo got into an accident.

439
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,380
What accident?

440
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,579
I don't know.
We should go and find out.

441
00:31:19,019 --> 00:31:20,119
Are you going somewhere?

442
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:24,720
- Let's go together.
- Are we a team now?

443
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:30,890
Okay. Here comes "The Avengers".

444
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:52,680
(Mr. Cheon)

445
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,089
Section Chief Cheon.

446
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:17,009
What happened to you?

447
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,509
I had a concussion,
so I can't remember.

448
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,480
Can't remember what?

449
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,049
No matter how hard I try,

450
00:32:23,549 --> 00:32:25,319
I can't remember his face.

451
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:29,049
He fell asleep.
I think he was tired.

452
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,359
Yes, we'll be home soon.

453
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:36,160
Of course, I'll drive safely.
Our son's in the car.

454
00:32:37,029 --> 00:32:38,359
Don't you know your husband?

455
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:43,730
Do you remember the fried chicken
Jun Young liked last week?

456
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,599
You should order one.

457
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,539
Okay, bye.

458
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,509
What a nagger.

459
00:33:09,589 --> 00:33:11,359
Gosh. Jun Young...

460
00:33:12,059 --> 00:33:13,230
Are you okay?

461
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,069
Jun Young. Wake up.

462
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:20,339
Son! Wake up!

463
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:23,069
Jun Young! Jun Young!

464
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:26,140
Wake up.

465
00:33:26,579 --> 00:33:28,750
Son! Wake up!

466
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,450
Jun Young! Wake up!

467
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,720
Jun Young!

468
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,890
Jun Young! Son!

469
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,990
Jun Young!

470
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:42,660
Please help my son out first.
He's in the backseat.

471
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,960
Jun Young! Jun Young!

472
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:47,559
My son. My son.

473
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:50,170
Jun Young! Jun Young!

474
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:52,900
Jun Young! Help my son first!

475
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:55,339
My son! Jun Young!

476
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,980
Jun Young, no...

477
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,079
What are you doing?
There's someone inside.

478
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:05,519
I said,
there's someone in the backseat!

479
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,280
My son is still inside!
Get him out right now!

480
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:10,150
Jun Young!

481
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:11,920
Jun Young!

482
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:13,989
Jun Young!

483
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,559
I can't remember his face...

484
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,360
at all.

485
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:28,670
Please read my memory for me
so I can find him.

486
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,000
Does your head hurt?

487
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:00,070
No, no. It's nothing. I'm fine.

488
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:18,590
Jun Young!

489
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,289
Jun Young!

490
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,429
The Eraser! The Eraser!

491
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,099
"The Eraser"?

492
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,070
The one who only kills garbage?

493
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:11,269
Was it him?

494
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:14,940
Why would he kill my son?

495
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,550
Jun Young is a good boy.

496
00:36:19,179 --> 00:36:21,219
He couldn't even kill a bug.

497
00:36:24,789 --> 00:36:26,119
I'll rip that jerk into pieces...

498
00:36:26,619 --> 00:36:28,260
with my own hands.

499
00:36:29,389 --> 00:36:30,460
Give it to me.

500
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:36,699
That thing in your pocket.

501
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,300
His pocket?

502
00:36:52,579 --> 00:36:53,679
What is this?

503
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,690
- The button from his jacket.
- What are you doing?

504
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,059
Section Chief Cheon swallowed it
after ripping it off.

505
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,230
Just find me a clue.

506
00:37:05,699 --> 00:37:07,659
I'll catch him with my own hands.

507
00:37:10,329 --> 00:37:11,469
There's a design.

508
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,239
"A design"?

509
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,840
It looks like a flame.

510
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:25,579
I think I know what it is.

511
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:35,989
What is this?

512
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,530
It must be a torch
inside the flower.

513
00:37:39,530 --> 00:37:40,630
I see it now.

514
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,969
Go ahead.

515
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,269
Are you sure you verified it?

516
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:51,170
Okay. Good job.

517
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,340
It's a symbol for firefighters.

518
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:55,780
"Firefighters"?

519
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,989
There's a torch inside a flower
that a bird is brooding.

520
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:05,519
It's the symbol for firefighters.

521
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:07,219
How do you know all this?

522
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,989
It's all thanks
to the Crime Data Center.

523
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:10,429
Is there such a thing in Korea?

524
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,659
We're in the process
of constructing it.

525
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:14,599
We're getting all kinds of help
now that things are rolling.

526
00:38:14,599 --> 00:38:16,000
It was me who initiated it.

527
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,869
It's hard not to respect you,
Senior Superintendent Han.

528
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:23,440
See? This is what you call
a respectable boss.

529
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,769
What about the initials?

530
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:26,909
It had an "S" and a "B".

531
00:38:26,909 --> 00:38:30,010
There are eight affiliated
institutes of the fire department...

532
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:32,380
that can use
"S" and "B" as initials.

533
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:34,550
But there's no need to look further.

534
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,650
- It's there, isn't it?
- Where?

535
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,489
He was hiding
where he first showed up.

536
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,219
- What?
- What? Then...

537
00:38:42,429 --> 00:38:44,659
Let's go and see
what's waiting for us.

538
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,300
Did you read anything else
in Cheon Ki Soo's memories?

539
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:49,199
Was it really him who deleted
the case records from 20 years ago?

540
00:38:49,469 --> 00:38:52,170
Also, why did the Eraser
kill Section Chief Cheon's son?

541
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,969
- I don't know.
- You don't?

542
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:59,710
Did you only get to see
the murder scene from last night?

543
00:39:00,409 --> 00:39:02,110
Are you having problems again?

544
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,780
Should we call someone
from the medical team?

545
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,880
Don't mind me.

546
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:07,119
What if you faint again?

547
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,590
Let him be.
He wants to overwork himself.

548
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:12,690
You might be young, but
there's no telling who'll go next.

549
00:39:13,659 --> 00:39:16,460
Shouldn't we ask Section Chief Cheon
about the records?

550
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,829
Are you a psychopath?
His only son died last night.

551
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:21,329
But this case is urgent.

552
00:39:21,329 --> 00:39:23,070
The Eraser will be where
we're going now.

553
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:25,769
We'll find something,
whether it's his tail or body.

554
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,199
How can you call me a psychopath?

555
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,989
(Shimbae Fire Station)

556
00:39:49,659 --> 00:39:50,659
Let's go.

557
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:59,300
(Shimbae Fire Station)

558
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:03,469
We have VIP guests. Hurry
and prepare a welcoming ceremony.

559
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:06,239
- Yes, sir.
- Wait. We don't have much time.

560
00:40:06,239 --> 00:40:09,150
We're in a rush, so could we
just ask you a few questions?

561
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:12,050
Firstly,
could you take a look at this?

562
00:40:13,150 --> 00:40:14,349
A button?

563
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:16,150
What kind of button is it?

564
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:19,159
It's an important clue, and it has
the symbol of your station on it.

565
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,789
- For a case?
- It's a murder case.

566
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:24,460
- What?
- I haven't seen buttons like this.

567
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:27,860
It was on the sleeve of a top.
Maybe it's from a uniform.

568
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,300
It's over there.

569
00:40:31,570 --> 00:40:33,239
There are no buttons
on this uniform.

570
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,539
- The commemorative suit.
- "The commemorative suit"?

571
00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:38,409
The commemorative suit you get
for serving for 20 years.

572
00:40:38,409 --> 00:40:39,739
Isn't this a button from that?

573
00:40:40,139 --> 00:40:41,780
Yes, you're right.

574
00:40:54,519 --> 00:40:56,860
Can we get the list of people
who have these suits?

575
00:40:57,190 --> 00:41:00,130
Everyone gets it when they reach
their 20th year.

576
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,760
Could I look at your current list
of employees?

577
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:04,769
Okay.

578
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,409
Sir, how long did you work
in Shimbae City?

579
00:41:09,869 --> 00:41:11,670
About 30 years.

580
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:15,639
Do you know about the abandoned
factory case from 20 years ago?

581
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:18,250
Do you mean the one where
several university students died?

582
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,920
- So you know.
- It was huge. Of course, I do.

583
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:23,019
Why didn't the word get out
about it, then?

584
00:41:23,889 --> 00:41:27,489
I think the families of the deceased
stopped articles from publishing.

585
00:41:27,489 --> 00:41:30,389
They were rich families,
so it would've made more commotion.

586
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,929
I remember hearing a rumor.

587
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,400
What rumor?

588
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:38,030
That the dead were using drugs.

589
00:41:38,570 --> 00:41:39,670
"Drugs"?

590
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:41,170
Narcotics.

591
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,880
Did you say Det. Dong Baek is here?

592
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,449
- Yes.
- Why?

593
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:53,650
You know how we get
commemorative suits, right?

594
00:41:53,949 --> 00:41:57,050
Apparently, one of our suits
was found at a murder scene.

595
00:41:57,449 --> 00:41:59,289
What? One of ours?

596
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:01,119
You have a suit too, don't you?

597
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:03,989
Mine disappeared.
I had it taken to the cleaners,

598
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,900
and the owner lost it.

599
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,699
Are you saying those youths
went crazy due to drugs,

600
00:42:08,699 --> 00:42:10,530
and that's why they beat
and killed each other?

601
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,599
But the cause of death
was carbon monoxide.

602
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,869
It's true they died
because of the bonfire,

603
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:21,139
but it's really because of
the drugs.

604
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,550
They did drugs and killed
each other,

605
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:24,849
yet it was still covered up?

606
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:29,820
Here.

607
00:42:33,590 --> 00:42:37,690
There are 9 people who have worked
20 years, including me.

608
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,929
(Years of Service)

609
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,929
It's six if we exclude women.

610
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,570
Can we meet them?

611
00:42:46,699 --> 00:42:48,900
There are only three
who are on duty right now.

612
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:56,380
What?

613
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,079
Dong Baek's location is up
on social media.

614
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,449
It's Shimbae Fire Station
We'll be there in five minutes.

615
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,650
You better not let him escape.

616
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,889
We'll catch him no matter what.

617
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:08,860
Step on it.

618

620
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:19,070
Yes.

621
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,469
This is Inspector Kim Do Su
of the Intelligence Division.

622
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:21,699
I'm calling to report on
what you ordered.

623
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,539
Det. Dong is currently at
Shimbae Fire Station.

624
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,309
Shimbae Fire Station?

625
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,440
Yes. The prosecution is
on its way to arrest him.

626
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:32,780
- Keep your eyes on him.
- Yes, sir.

627
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:38,349
Cancel the rest of my schedules
for today.

628
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:39,719
Yes, sir.

629
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:54,099
There's been a poisonous gas leak
at a factory in Simpan-dong.

630
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:56,210
Emergency phase one.
All units move to the site.

631
00:43:56,710 --> 00:43:57,769
I'm sorry.

632
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,610
I guess you'll have to wait.

633
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:03,980
Is there anything else you remember
about that incident?

634
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:07,219
I'm not sure, it's been so long.

635
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:09,920
Oh, right!

636
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:13,989
Oh, never mind. It's nothing.

637
00:44:14,219 --> 00:44:15,719
Please tell us anything.

638
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:22,429
When that accident occurred
at the abandoned warehouse,

639
00:44:22,929 --> 00:44:24,269
I heard a policeman...

640
00:44:25,269 --> 00:44:27,170
arrived at the site
before the firefighters.

641
00:44:29,570 --> 00:44:30,710
And?

642
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:33,280
But I heard
he didn't do anything...

643
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:35,639
and just ran away on his own.

644
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:37,110
Why?

645
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:38,809
Maybe he didn't
want to get involved.

646
00:44:39,849 --> 00:44:41,280
Was he driving a patrol car?

647
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:43,389
Probably not.

648
00:44:44,019 --> 00:44:46,659
- Who was the one who saw him?
- What?

649
00:44:47,659 --> 00:44:51,630
Well, that's... I'm not sure.

650
00:44:52,929 --> 00:44:54,030
What's wrong?

651
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,730
The report only came through
the fire station back then.

652
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,730
The police didn't even receive
a report,

653
00:44:57,969 --> 00:45:00,070
so it would only make sense
if the firefighters arrived first.

654
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,639
If we receive an order to move out,

655
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:03,570
the police receive a call
automatically.

656
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,210
But you said it wasn't a patrol car.

657
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:06,980
That's right.

658
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:08,980
The police can't arrive faster
than firefighters.

659
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,980
But if he arrived first
nevertheless...

660
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:13,449
Does it mean that policeman...

661
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:15,650
is the Eraser?

662
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,289
If the Eraser is a policeman,
everything adds up.

663
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:25,460
Was that why he was able to erase
all the records?

664
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:27,400
It makes sense.

665
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,630
The Eraser?

666
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:32,400
Wait.

667
00:45:33,739 --> 00:45:35,800
Then what about that button?

668
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:37,570
What?

669
00:45:37,570 --> 00:45:39,010
We were chasing the button
that fell off...

670
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,780
from the firefighters’ suit
the Eraser was wearing.

671
00:45:41,539 --> 00:45:43,750
But if the Eraser
wasn't a firefighter...

672
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:45,909
but a policeman who was seen
in that warehouse...

673
00:45:46,619 --> 00:45:50,389
Then who is the real owner
of that firefighters’ suit?

674
00:45:50,619 --> 00:45:51,920
What if the Eraser...

675
00:45:52,550 --> 00:45:55,019
intentionally stole that suit
from here? For what?

676
00:45:59,130 --> 00:46:01,829
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

677
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:04,699
Who is the person
who saw that policeman?

678
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,539
- Just ignore what I said.
- This is really important.

679
00:46:10,940 --> 00:46:12,909
He's a member from the rescue team.

680
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,250
Is it Rescue Team Leader
Noh Gwang Gyu?

681
00:46:17,710 --> 00:46:18,949
Mr. Noh?

682
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:22,320
I just asked him about that suit.

683
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:23,789
I lost it.

684
00:46:23,789 --> 00:46:26,590
I sent it to the dry cleaners,
and they just lost it.

685
00:46:26,690 --> 00:46:28,519
He said he lost that suit.

686
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:31,190
Where is he now?

687
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:32,929
He probably went to the site.

688
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,059
He's in danger.

689
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,699
The suit the Eraser was wearing.

690
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:40,199
It was a clue...

691
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:42,039
about who he'd kill next.

692
00:46:42,139 --> 00:46:44,539
Order Mr. Noh to come back
immediately.

693
00:46:45,670 --> 00:46:48,480
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know either.

694
00:46:48,579 --> 00:46:50,880
The police said you might be
in danger...

695
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:51,880
and want you to come back
right now.

696
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,019
What is this nonsense?
Everything we do is dangerous.

697
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,449
Tell them to come see me
it's urgent.

698
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,820
All right.

699
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,019
I can forgive you
if you fail to rescue someone,

700
00:47:00,019 --> 00:47:02,019
but I will never forgive you
if you get hurt. Got it?

701
00:47:02,019 --> 00:47:03,429
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

702
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,130
His life is in danger!

703
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:09,000
He's the type who never leaves
an accident site.

704
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:11,099
We should go.

705
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:19,440
Cheon Ki Soo was in charge of
the case where the Eraser...

706
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,510
killed 7 people in a warehouse
20 years ago.

707
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:22,510
Right.

708
00:47:22,510 --> 00:47:24,780
And when the Eraser burned
Cheon Ki Soo's son to death,

709
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:27,679
he apparently stole
Mr. Noh Gwang Gyu's suit.

710
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,480
- Then is that...
- It's a warning on who he'll kill.

711
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:32,090
He'll kill the owner of that suit?

712
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:33,690
He's getting rid of a witness.

713
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:36,530
During the incident
in the warehouse,

714
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:39,130
Mr. Noh saw a mysterious policeman.

715
00:47:39,829 --> 00:47:42,900
The real Eraser, who arrived
at the site before him.

716
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:45,699
So he's trying to get rid of
Noh Gwang Gyu since he's a witness.

717
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,239
We need to find him
and read his memory...

718
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,469
There he is!

719
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:52,670
- Get out of here. We got this.
- Dong Baek!

720
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:53,840
We'll stop them.

721
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,940
- Hey!
- I'll see you later.

722
00:47:56,179 --> 00:47:59,010
- Hey!
- Catch him! Stop!

723
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,719
- Block them!
- Hey, move!

724
00:48:24,409 --> 00:48:26,110
End the search. Let's move out.

725
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:27,809
There's someone on the second floor
who needs to be rescued.

726
00:48:27,809 --> 00:48:29,909
She's on the north side
on the second floor.

727
00:48:30,409 --> 00:48:31,809
I'm on the second floor.

728
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,750
- I'll go check.
- Roger.

729
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:48,659
Help.

730
00:48:49,869 --> 00:48:50,929
Help me.

731
00:48:59,739 --> 00:49:00,809
Are you okay?

732
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,579
Mr. Noh!

733
00:50:47,579 --> 00:50:48,679
Mr. Noh!

734
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:51,190
Darn. Let's go back in.

735
00:50:51,190 --> 00:50:52,349
Change your oxygen tanks!

736
00:50:54,489 --> 00:50:55,559
He's coming!

737
00:51:05,300 --> 00:51:06,440
Mr. Noh!

738
00:51:11,869 --> 00:51:13,780
- Hey, remove his gear.
- Mr. Noh.

739
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:15,139
Hurry.

740
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,980
Check his pulse!

741
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:22,380
- Mr. Noh.
- Mr. Noh!

742
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:28,789
Dong Baek.

743
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:30,590
Baek! Are you okay?

744
00:51:30,590 --> 00:51:32,230
Are you insane?
Why did you go in there?

745
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:34,059
It's him. He was here.

746
00:51:34,059 --> 00:51:36,300
- What?
- He probably didn't get far.

747
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,769
Hurry, move! Hurry!

748
00:51:41,969 --> 00:51:43,039
What are you doing?

749
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:45,769
His memory from 20 years ago.

750
00:51:50,349 --> 00:51:52,309
- The ambulance is here.
- Move!

751
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:53,579
Lift him up.

752
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,820
Wait! Wait.

753
00:51:56,349 --> 00:51:57,489
Place him on the stretcher.

754
00:51:58,889 --> 00:52:01,690
No, wait. Wait!

755
00:52:01,820 --> 00:52:03,530
- Let's lift him up.
- 1, 2, 3.

756
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:06,559
Wait, no.

757
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,500
Aren't you Det. Dong Baek?

758
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:10,469
We're with the police.
This is an emergency.

759
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,789
His heartbeat and breathing
have returned.

760
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:47,940
You're unstable right now.

761
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:50,739
Stop it!

762
00:53:03,019 --> 00:53:05,920
(20 years ago, April 2000)

763
00:53:17,469 --> 00:53:18,630
Are you okay?

764
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,969
Hey!

765
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:26,010
Kid, are you okay?

766
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,260
Can you call an ambulance...

767
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:47,159
Hey!

768
00:54:10,389 --> 00:54:13,460
(Shim Sang Ah)

769
00:54:16,190 --> 00:54:17,190
The Eraser.

770
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:21,829
The Eraser has a scar
on his right arm.

771
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,230
His right arm? Did you see his face?

772
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,530
No.

773
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:28,699
He had a mask on
so I couldn't see. I don't know.

774
00:54:32,909 --> 00:54:34,010
Your nose his bleeding.

775
00:54:35,610 --> 00:54:38,150
His nose. Inside his nose...

776
00:54:43,849 --> 00:54:46,449
- Det. Dong!
- Det. Dong!

777
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:53,530
Hey.

778
00:54:56,730 --> 00:54:57,730
Come here!

779
00:55:05,369 --> 00:55:07,510
What? What do you want?

780
00:55:45,179 --> 00:55:48,380
Honey. Put the laundry
in the washing machine.

781
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,869
Det. Dong!

782

Lee Jun Woo.

799
00:58:06,590 --> 00:58:08,159
All 17 of them...

800
00:58:09,090 --> 00:58:10,989
died because of you, Dad.

801
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:15,400
Because of you and me.

802
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:20,300
Although you can't say anything,

803
00:58:22,469 --> 00:58:24,510
and these people can't hear,

804
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:34,780
I'm really sorry.

805
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:39,719
A murderer who always prioritized
his justification...

806
00:58:39,719 --> 00:58:40,989
changed his method of killing.

807
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:42,860
"An innocent person
will be crucified."

808
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,230
"Instead of the sinner."

809
00:58:44,389 --> 00:58:46,230
His purpose was murder itself.

810
00:58:46,230 --> 00:58:47,730
Cheon Ki Soo is our connection.

811
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:48,900
Who are you?

812
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:51,969
A savior who will save
your son's life.

813
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,269
- Cheon Ki Soo disappeared.
- Without a trace.

814
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:57,210
All I did was chase the Eraser.

815
00:58:57,210 --> 00:58:59,510
- What?
- I saw the scar on his right arm.

816
00:58:59,739 --> 00:59:01,679
- Who is it?
- You were the Eraser.

817
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:04,480
You were there 20 years ago
in Shimbae!
