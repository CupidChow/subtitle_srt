A thug with a hammer tattoo.

8
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,299
Seo Kyeong was the one who took her clothes off.

9
00:01:04,469 --> 00:01:08,069
Did you ever kill a woman 20 years ago?

10
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,739
I heard you were a weirdo.

11
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:14,409
Gosh.

12
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,150
The Lord has created the skies and the ground.

13
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,060
No matter how much you deny it.

14
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,129
Humans must...

15
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:30,359
If I didn't kill anyone, what will you do?

16
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,400
Apologize?

17
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:46,709
Get rid of it!

18
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:53,489
Goodness.

19
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:55,189
He's the best.

20
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:16,310
Excuse me.

21
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,639
Please step back.

22
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,629
- Yes? - Where are you?

23
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,960
- I'm on my way to their office. - What?

24
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,199
Is that where she is?

25
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,930
They were just hired for the job.

26
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,300
What do you mean?

27
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:45,169
How could you beat him up?

28
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:47,870
The real culprit is someone who received sexual favors from her.

29
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,469
What?

30
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,879
Old Man, I need you to do a favor.

31
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,379
- The red pig? - Hurry up! Time is ticking!

32
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:57,319
Still, you shouldn't...

33
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,120
Baek? Baek!

34
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,129
I think someone's dead.

35
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,270
They must've jumped off this building.

36
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,810
- They took the person. - Look.

(Episode 2: Red Pig)

38
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,939
(24 minutes ago)

39
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,620
- Yes? - Is Seo Kyeong home?

40
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:15,229
I don't think so.

41
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,529
You don't think so?

42
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:19,199
You should've broken the door open and checked!

43
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,470
Come on, the police station is right across the street.

44
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,500
Then you could've called a repairman...

45
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,600
and said you were her brother!

46
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:26,040
What if they report me?

47
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,910
Check this instant.

48
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:33,310
Wouldn't it be better to say that I'm her boyfriend?

49
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,350
Darn it. Just do it!

50
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,079
You should do it yourself.

51
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,120
We really don't get along.

52

53
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,399
Delivery.

54
00:05:03,709 --> 00:05:04,779
Where is he?

55
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:06,410
Search the place!

56
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,750
- Yes, sir. - Go.

57
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,110
- Is he not here? - What is it?

58
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,420
Clear.

59
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:13,250
- Darn it. - Clear.

60
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,649
The place is empty.

61

(President Oh Yeon Tak)

62
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:29,000
Sir, we're in trouble.

63
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,300
If I didn't kill anyone,

64
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,339
- what will you do? - What?

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,069
Apologize?

66
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,040
I'll let you off for urinating in public.

67
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:43,779
Get rid of it!

68
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,259
What is that sound?

69
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,709
Darn it.

70
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,970
Go inside!

71
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:11,740
Gosh, it's a mess. Open that.

72
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:13,180
Open it.

73
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:17,050
Hey, you punk!

74
00:06:22,649 --> 00:06:24,959
Stop what you're doing, you scumbag.

75
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,819
Don't get smart, or I'll kill you.

76
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:30,759
Darn it.

77
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:36,699
- Let's go! - 1, 2!

78
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,639
- Darn it! - 1, 2!

79
00:06:41,939 --> 00:06:44,110
- 1, 2! - Hold on. No!

80
00:06:45,139 --> 00:06:47,949
- Hold on. - You scumbag.

81
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,480
Did you think you could run away?

82
00:06:50,649 --> 00:06:52,050
Did you?

83
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,449
1, 2!

84
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,060
Darn it.

85
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,670
10 percent?

86
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:18,240
There was a 90-percent possibility...

87
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,579
that the one with the burner phone was the culprit...

88
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,379
and a 10-percent possibility that we were wrong.

89
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,750
And yet, you investigated the latter as well?

90
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,620
There were no call logs on that phone.

91
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,449
She only used a secured messenger service...

92
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:29,819
that didn't leave any records.

93
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,389
- Why? - It was something unexpected.

94
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:35,029
Kim Seo Kyeong was assaulted six months ago.

95
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,730
Her ex-boyfriend had stalked her.

96
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,199
He claimed he beat her because she became corrupt.

97
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:47,470
"Corrupt"?

98
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:53,639
He had found out...

99
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,480
that she had been giving sexual favors.

100
00:07:58,649 --> 00:08:00,790
The pimp's alibi has been confirmed.

101
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:04,920
- Then? - The culprit was a client.

102
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:11,000
He had planned to exploit her that night.

103
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,170
A top-drawer individual...

104
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,500
who had completely hidden his identity.

105
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,709
They're reporting in.

106
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:29,709
One of the suspects has fallen from the building.

107
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:31,050
What?

108
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,220
He was climbing down on a rope.

109
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:47,269
That will be all for today.

110
00:08:47,529 --> 00:08:51,539
I pray that the Lord will be with you at all times.

111
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,580
What day is it today?

112
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,870
I was kidnapped on Sunday, so it must be Monday.

113
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,570
It's tomorrow.

114
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,409
What is?

115
00:09:28,539 --> 00:09:29,610
The execution.

116
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:34,580
What? What do you mean?

117
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:48,860
He kills one every Tuesday.

118
00:09:51,059 --> 00:09:54,429
The girl before you died on a Tuesday as well.

119
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,799
No way.

120
00:09:59,139 --> 00:10:00,539
Brace yourself.

121
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,039
You must score 90 points or higher.

122
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:07,480
What should I do?

123
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,120
If you score lower than that, you'll die...

124
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:14,289
a gruesome death.

125
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,159
The culprit kidnaps his victims on Tuesdays...

126
00:10:26,299 --> 00:10:28,700
and kills them a week after.

127
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,870
It'll be Tuesday in four hours.

128
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,710
Please do your best to locate her until the end.

129
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,740
(VIP Ward, Waiting Room)

130
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,440
I've been interrogating both of them.

131
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,250
But they're not caving in.

132
00:10:41,649 --> 00:10:44,149
They've been separated, and we've been pressuring them.

133
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:48,019
Once one of them caves in, we'll be able to get a lead.

134
00:10:49,789 --> 00:10:51,190
Hey, Lawyer Kim.

135
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:54,559
File a lawsuit again Dong Baek and the rest.

136
00:10:55,259 --> 00:10:56,929
Make sure to teach them a lesson.

137
00:10:56,929 --> 00:10:58,960
I'm too old for this.

138
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,629
Okay.

139
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,700
Who are you?

140
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:07,370
- Senior Superintendent Han Sun Mi. - "Constable"?

141
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:09,039
She's the senior superintendent.

142
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,039
"Senior superintendent"?

143
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,980
- She looks young. - Be quiet!

144
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:21,120
How dare you raise your voice after assaulting me?

145
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:22,789
Things have changed nowadays.

146
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,759
- Mr. Oh Yeon Tak. - What?

147
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,789
I don't care if you sue Mr. Superpower.

148
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,690
I'm only interested in the murderer.

149
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,960
And why would you ask me about him?

150
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,629
I also have no interest in your pimping.

151
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:35,870
At least, for now.

152
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:38,600
Who keeps spreading such rumors?

153
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,840
Kim Seo Kyeong is dying because of you.

154
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:47,279
You have tender hands.

155
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:50,080
But what can I do? I know nothing about this.

156
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,879
Your client is the murderer.

157
00:11:58,659 --> 00:11:59,659
Tell me.

158
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,490
Whom did she meet?

159
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,230
What are you talking about?

160
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:12,440
The longer you stay silent, the more interested I'll become.

161
00:12:15,509 --> 00:12:16,639
Are senior superintendents...

162
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,080
invincible or something?

163
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,779
You sexually assaulted and threatened wannabe actresses.

164
00:12:22,809 --> 00:12:23,809
Do you have proof?

165
00:12:26,049 --> 00:12:27,419
You think you're innocent since you got rid of the evidence?

166
00:12:29,049 --> 00:12:31,490
But like you said, things have changed nowadays.

167
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,919
One testimony against you,

168
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,460
and you'll be found guilty.

169
00:12:37,059 --> 00:12:38,200
Guess what?

170
00:12:39,429 --> 00:12:41,970
I'm not the type...

171
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:44,570
to be easily intimidated by such threats.

172
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,870
You must feel safe...

173
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,840
since the powerful has your back.

174
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:55,649
That's how fools think.

175
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:57,549
Do you know how they're still so powerful?

176
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:02,250
It's all thanks to disposables like you.

177
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,289
Keep going.

178
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:09,330
One more victim, and I'll become completely obsessed with this case.

179
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,730
I'll make sure to find you guilty.

180
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,799
You will never set foot outside of a penitentiary.

181
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,200
At least, until you're allowed to receive your pension.

182
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:23,139
Rookies like you... Hey, I'm not done talking.

183
00:13:23,139 --> 00:13:24,779
Where are you going? Hey.

184
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:26,139
- Should we provoke him more? - I'm not done.

185
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:27,610
He doesn't know.

186
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,179
What?

187
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,320
He doesn't know whom Kim Seo Kyeong met.

188
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:36,549
I really feel bad for her and want to help.

189
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,460
You scumbag, do you think we'd buy that?

190
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,490
You're in charge of the girls.

191
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,659
So how could you not know who she was meeting?

192
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:44,799
There's a separate organization that handles the clients.

193
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:45,830
You little...

194
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,370
I have absolutely no idea who our clients are.

195
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,399
How could you work...

196
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:53,039
with an unknown organization?

197
00:13:53,039 --> 00:13:54,139
- How? - Answer.

198
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,940
So...

199
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,779
I think it was two years ago. Someone contacted us,

200
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:01,279
saying that he was interested in Seo Kyeong.

201
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,149
He had sent us 100,000 dollars right away.

202
00:14:03,179 --> 00:14:04,850
Our president went money-crazy...

203
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,179
and searched for more pretty girls.

204
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,289
Kim Min Kwon.

205
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,250
Yes?

206
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:15,389
Try to remember.

207
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:19,200
- Look... - Because if you can't,

208
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,029
I'll make you take responsibility...

209
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:23,070
for their deaths.

210
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:26,169
I can't remember anything for the life of me.

211
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:32,179
Oh, right. Number 13.

212
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:33,940
He was addressed as Number 13.

213
00:14:34,409 --> 00:14:36,980
- "Number 13". - It was the client's number.

214
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:40,120
What else? What else?

215
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,789
Why would you be here?

216
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,889
- Let me through. - Are you here to steal information?

217
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:46,490
I just want to see Kim Min Kwon, so move aside.

218
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,289
I won't. I guess you need to get more beaten up.

219
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:50,690
Is that what you want?

220
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,500
I'm fine. I let my guard down.

221
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,200
I beat him to a pulp earlier.

222
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,740
I let you do that so that I could read your memory.

223
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,600
Don't be ridiculous.

224
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,139
Gosh, this little punk. Hey.

225
00:15:03,139 --> 00:15:04,539
Lim Chil Kyu!

226
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,779
Are you okay?

227
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:13,179
What is it?

228
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,519
- I want to see Kim Min Kwon. - This has nothing to do...

229
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,950
with Yoon Ye Rim's disappearance.

230
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,559
Don't you want all the help that you can get?

231
00:15:19,889 --> 00:15:20,889
Sir.

232
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,899
We'll wrap this up soon.

233
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,549
My name is Han Sun Mi.

234
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:44,879
I don't think you should shake hands.

235
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,659
So you want to scan Kim Min Kwon's memory?

236
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:54,789
- Who are you? - Watch what you say.

237
00:15:54,789 --> 00:15:55,789
She's a senior superintendent.

238
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:58,759
- Move aside. I'm in a rush. - You little...

239
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
You can talk to me. I'm the head of this case.

240
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:03,370
- Do you have the final say? - Of course.

241
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,240
I need his memory in order to know whom Kim Seo Kyeong met last.

242
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,740
What if there's nothing useful in his memory?

243
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,580
I still need to see it. There may be leads that he's not aware of.

244
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:17,250
You're going to pull out memories that even he doesn't remember?

245
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,049
No.

246
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:25,389
- What? - Lower your voice.

247
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:27,190
What an impudent punk.

248
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,129
I won't allow it.

249
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,860
- Why? - Aren't you suspended?

250
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,799
Why does that matter?

251
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:36,330
The court won't acknowledge any evidence found by you.

252
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:38,799
Don't waste your time. The victims are dying...

253
00:16:38,799 --> 00:16:40,440
as we speak!

254
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,870
Show some respect!

255
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,039
The culprit won't be found guilty since it'll be an illegal arrest.

256
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,250
Then I could at least scan him as a means of rescuing the victims.

257
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:50,710
Exactly.

258
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,350
That's different.

259
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:55,889
You wouldn't need my permission.

260
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,590
- Are you saying... - Any information he finds...

261
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,789
won't be shared with us.

262
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:03,429
- However... - Kim Min Kwon will tell you...

263
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:05,200
what he remembers.

264
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:07,500
You're quite smart.

265
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:11,470
But if any problems occur, you must take full responsibility.

266
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,940
All by yourself.

267
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,369
Okay. Deal.

268
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:22,150
This is truly an honor.

269
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,420
It's a shame I'm in this state.

270
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,720
You do know what you're signing up for, right?

271
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,220
Yes, I'll be offering my memory.

272
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,289
- And the purpose of it? - To catch the culprit.

273
00:17:30,289 --> 00:17:32,390
- Hey. - Oh, right.

274
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,220
To rescue the victim.

275
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,059
Wait.

276
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,970
It won't hurt, right?

277
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:43,430
- Not at all. - Will my memories get mixed up,

278
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,740
or will I suffer from dementia?

279
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:45,740
Never.

280
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,039
- Wait, wait. - What is it this time?

281
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:00,150
Last night,

282
00:18:02,049 --> 00:18:03,849
I watched some porn.

283
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:07,990
Don't worry. If he tells others about your memory,

284
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:09,730
I'll arrest him.

285
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:12,829
All right, then.

286
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:23,869
- Who are you? - We're from...

287
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:24,880
the Northern District Prosecutors' Office.

288
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,880
This is an emergency arrest of Det. Dong Baek...

289
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,150
for repeated assault.

290
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,250
Grab him.

291
00:18:30,349 --> 00:18:31,380
- Hold him. - What is going on?

292
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,980
- Stop him! - Stop him!

293
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,750
- All right. - Back away.

294
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,089
What is this arrest for?

295
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:40,990
- And who are you? - It's been a while, Sun Mi.

296
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:46,430
Have you been well?

297
00:18:58,109 --> 00:18:59,579
Did we see each other for the last time...

298
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:00,779
at the institute?

299
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,750
Do you have a warrant?

300
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:09,049
Emergency arrests can only be carried out...

301
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:10,119
if the crime is worth at least three years in prison.

302
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,759
- Mere assault isn't one of them. - Goodness.

303
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,730
I'm intimidated by the top student at our institute.

304
00:19:15,789 --> 00:19:16,990
Send me a petition of appeal.

305
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:19,829
Or request a warrant.

306
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:22,730
- Get out. - Hey.

307
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:24,029
Did you say that it was assault?

308
00:19:24,269 --> 00:19:26,740
What? Yes.

309
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,710
He committed bodily harm. That's a maximum of seven years.

310
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,480
Don't be ridiculous. He was just apprehending the culprit...

311
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,549
and hurt him by accident.

312
00:19:34,549 --> 00:19:36,079
We'll take our time and interrogate him.

313
00:19:36,849 --> 00:19:38,019
Do your job.

314
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:40,650
- Escort him. - Hey, hey.

315
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,750
Move aside.

316
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:46,059
Give me just five minutes.

317
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,259
The kidnapped victims' lives are at stake.

318
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,160
- Five minutes? - After that, he's all yours.

319
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,029
What? Is he going to scan his memory?

320
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,369
But guess what? I'm not up for it.

321
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:00,839
People's lives are at stake here.

322
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:07,140
From now on, if any of you touch my men,

323
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:08,849
we'll charge you with obstruction of justice.

324
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:13,420
I don't know if you heard, but this isn't a threat.

325
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,529
How dare you lay your finger on a prosecutor?

326
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,400
If I annoy you so much, you should've become...

327
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:27,970
a judge or a prosecutor.

328
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,240
It's someone else.

329
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:36,940
- What? - The target.

330
00:20:37,839 --> 00:20:39,109
It's not Det. Dong.

331
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:42,809
What are you saying?

332
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:44,619
Kim Min Kwon.

333
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,049
You're here to interrupt our investigation.

334
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:50,690
What are you saying?

335
00:20:50,819 --> 00:20:52,190
Thanks to you, we finally found out.

336
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:55,759
The one trying to cover this is the culprit.

337
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,130
I'll reveal his identity.

338
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,430
I'll expose who that Number 13 is.

339
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,670
What is Number 13?

340
00:21:08,609 --> 00:21:09,670
Let them through.

341
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,380
Let them.

342
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,339
- You better watch out. - Come here.

343
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:16,410
Darn it.

344
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,250

At this rate, they'll all die!

346

Starting this moment, our target has been changed.

348
00:21:31,859 --> 00:21:32,930
To whom?

349
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,869

350
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,069
(Professor Han Sun Mi)

351

357
00:22:09,099 --> 00:22:10,269
No, sir.

360
00:22:23,549 --> 00:22:25,650
She always had a good hunch.

361
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,089
Should we stop her?

362
00:22:30,490 --> 00:22:33,519
You don't admit she's good, do you?

363
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,289
- Pardon? - You're calling her Professor Han.

364
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:39,960
I put her in that position so she could be your right arm.

365
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,069
I'm sorry, sir. I'm just used to calling her that way.

She is officially a professor...

367
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:46,099
of the Korean National Police University.

368
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:48,640
I'm sure you're jealous.

369
00:22:48,769 --> 00:22:52,079
You rolled around in dirt for 20 years after graduating.

370
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,750
You thought you climbed up faster than your colleagues.

371
00:22:56,109 --> 00:22:58,279
But a young person who passed the bar exam...

372
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:01,250
is now in the same rank as you.

373
00:23:01,319 --> 00:23:02,490
No, sir. It's not like that.

374
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:04,819
Don't be so harsh.

375
00:23:05,289 --> 00:23:07,089
I started off as a constable.

376
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,490
I'm sorry, sir.

377

Burn it after you see it.

378
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,630

We're against the prosecution.

Northern District Prosecutors' Office came for no reason.

388

They just want to get attention through this case.

389

They are not the Crime Investigation Team.

and they turned the case into a public investigation this evening.

They also revealed the criminal's profile.

400
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,599
They suspect that the criminal used a claw hammer,

401
00:24:27,769 --> 00:24:29,740
and there have been at least two victims until now...

402

Yes. We're on our way in.

Yes.

Mom, I'm scared.

405
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:01,099
- A pig? - Yes, a red pig.

406
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,569
It's okay even if it's pink.

407

Please excuse me.

409
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:16,190
Actually, Baek jumped into investigating after seeing you.

410
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:18,789
He was suspended, so he had to do it in secret.

411
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,890
- Really? - Of course.

412
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:23,730
That's when he read "red pig" in the memory.

413
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:27,299
We came to see if there might be any clues here.

But, whose memory...

415
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,410
A testifier.

416
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,710
Don't worry.

417

Tell her what Baek is like.

418
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,750
He's the only detective in the world with a superpower...

You too.

505
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:48,930
I'm okay.

It's not for sure yet.

It's only what that Detective Superpower said.

508
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:54,900
No. There are more victims.

I'm going out for fresh air.

about the red pig?

I'm certain it was a recent memory.

549
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:29,489
It's something she saw after she was abducted.

550

We don't even know if that pig is in this neighborhood.

We don't have time. Let's start from the starting point.

there will be a murder today?

00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,269
as long as you didn't kill someone.

604
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:38,199
We didn't kill anyone.

605
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:40,000
- We just... - I told you to shut it.

606
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:43,369
- 7 minutes and 30 seconds. - We can ask them to find her.

607
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:45,139
- Bo Hyeon... - There's no need!

608
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:50,849
Bo Hyeon?

609
00:41:52,849 --> 00:41:54,050
It's none of your business.

610
00:41:58,519 --> 00:42:00,789
You were looking for Bo Hyeon.

Guys who pay to have sexual relationships with minors...

613
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:45,389
usually all go to unmanned motels. But...

614
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,130
But on that day,

615
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,929
he kept driving on a secluded road.

616
00:43:50,929 --> 00:43:52,030
Where are we going?

617
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,969
Stop the car.

618
00:43:58,809 --> 00:43:59,880
Stop it!

619
00:44:06,619 --> 00:44:08,679
Stop the car! Stop it now!

620
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:33,039
No, no!

621
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,570
Where did they go?

622
00:44:57,269 --> 00:44:59,070
I don't know. The car disappeared.

623
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:02,469
We lost her there. At the three-way intersection.

624
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:04,969
You should've called the police right away.

625
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:06,510
For what?

626
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:08,340
Bo Hyeon did that often.

627
00:45:08,610 --> 00:45:10,309
We thought she would ghost us after taking the money.

628
00:45:10,409 --> 00:45:13,050
My goodness. You kids should know better.

629
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,349
This is the head of the situation room.

630
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:17,119
I have a notice for all the officers.

631
00:45:17,389 --> 00:45:21,119
As of this moment, dispatch all your men to search Onha-ri.

632
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:24,789
The suspected vehicle is an old unidentified SUV.

633
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:26,599
Search all areas...

634
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:28,429
- where it might be hidden. - Hello, sir.

635
00:45:28,429 --> 00:45:29,769
Search houses too,

636
00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:32,070
and if the residents refuse, deem them as potential suspects...

637
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,699
and you may use force.

638
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:38,670
- Yes. - The RIU...

639
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,610
has dispatched all their men to search this area.

640
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:42,340
- Really? - What time is it?

641
00:45:42,909 --> 00:45:44,880
You know those teenagers we caught at the three-way intersection?

642
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:48,250
They're thugs who lure men that date teenagers to extort money,

643
00:45:48,380 --> 00:45:50,219
and they chased after a car that had one of their friends in it.

644
00:45:50,219 --> 00:45:51,250
What?

645
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:53,059
They lost her at the three-way intersection,

646
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:54,989
and the RIU will start searching near the villas in Onha-ri.

647
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,389
There was a profiling result...

648
00:45:56,389 --> 00:45:57,559
the perp might be from the upper class.

649
00:45:57,659 --> 00:45:58,829
You should get here too.

650
00:45:58,829 --> 00:46:00,730
Sir, you can go first.

651
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,800
You have to search all the villas and check.

652
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,469
- I have somewhere to drop by. - Hey, wait!

653
00:46:07,469 --> 00:46:08,570
Darn it!

654
00:46:10,239 --> 00:46:11,340
Shoot.

655
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:15,409
Come on, what is wrong with this?

656
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:20,019
What are you all doing? I told all of you to move out!

657
00:46:21,679 --> 00:46:24,389
Senior Superintendent Han, we received orders to wait.

658
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,559
- From who? The chief? - No, someone higher up.

659
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:34,960
Why did you stop the search on Onha-ri?

660
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:36,530
You're here.

661
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,900
Gosh, you look really stressed.

662
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:39,969
Sir!

663
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,840
Show some respect!

664
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:43,340
Senior Superintendent Han.

665
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:47,239
Why don't we talk in Young Soo's office?

666
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:49,579
We have to start the search immediately.

667
00:46:54,619 --> 00:46:58,420
Do you not know the owners of those villas?

668
00:46:58,690 --> 00:46:59,820
Does it matter?

669
00:47:01,690 --> 00:47:02,889
How are you going to search then?

670
00:47:03,389 --> 00:47:05,190
Will you beg a judge for a warrant?

671
00:47:05,329 --> 00:47:06,599
You'll search all 80 places...

672
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:08,300
including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court's villa?

673
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,599
Lives are at stake here.

674
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:11,369
On what grounds?

675
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:13,769
Because Detective Superpower says so?

676
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,309
Was it so hard to keep that a secret?

677
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,110
It's my assumption.

678
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:28,449
So? Will you break into their homes illegally?

679
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,889
And make all these people here lose their jobs?

680
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:33,690
Focus on identifying the vehicle.

681
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:38,159
If I'm wrong, I'll resign.

682
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,860
Do you think this will end with you losing your job?

683
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,869
- Please give me approval. - If I don't?

684
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:49,869
I'll take full responsibility.

685
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:51,909
Responsibility?

686
00:47:56,750 --> 00:47:57,880
Fine, then.

687
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:01,849
As of this moment, Senior Superintendent Han Sun Mi...

688
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:03,650
is dismissed as the head of the situation room.

689
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,519
- Sir? - Sir.

690
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,219
Please reconsider.

691
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,090
Senior Superintendent Han.

692
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:18,030
Giving orders is as important as the weight of my rank.

693
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:21,070
Changing orders with an indecisive attitude...

694
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:22,869
is something lowly people like you do...

695
00:48:22,869 --> 00:48:24,639
and that's why you can't become a leader.

696
00:48:30,550 --> 00:48:31,610
Do you understand...

697
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:35,949
the weight of my order?

698
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:48,099
Senior Superintendent Han will be punished strictly...

699
00:48:48,099 --> 00:48:49,530
through a disciplinary committee.

700
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:51,130
But still...

701
00:48:55,969 --> 00:48:57,070
Aren't you going to work?

702
00:48:58,369 --> 00:48:59,409
Yes, sir.

703
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:02,340
What are you doing? Search the SUV now!

704
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:03,780
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

705
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:10,719
Does that make sense?

706
00:49:10,719 --> 00:49:13,360
Det. Dong... Det. Dong is the suspect of the claw hammer case?

707
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:15,519
It's been confirmed he ran away last night.

708
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,690
But how could that make him a suspect?

709
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,559
The prosecution has started to make a move,

710
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:21,099
- Move! - so find out where Dong Baek is.

711
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:24,329
Hello? Hey, Kang Ji Eun.

712
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,199
Kang Ji Eun!

713
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:30,409
- Get ready. - Her vitals are dropping.

714
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:35,980
They're dropping more.

715
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:57,599
It has been confirmed there has been a third victim.

716
00:49:58,199 --> 00:50:00,969
The victim, Ms. Kim, who just passed away...

717
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:02,800
went missing two weeks ago and was found...

718
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,440
The mystery of the Claw Hammer Serial Murder Case...

719
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,440
- is starting to get out of hand. - Ms. Kim...

720
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:09,510
was initially assumed to be a victim related to the case...

721
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:12,809
According to the police, it seems there are at least...

722
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,920
two more victims that have been kidnapped.

723
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,449
Are there any additional updates?

724
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:20,460
The police are not revealing information on additional victims.

725
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,289
However, based on an exclusive tip we just received,

726
00:50:24,789 --> 00:50:26,500
one of the two victims who were kidnapped...

727
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,260
is Ms. Yoon, who went missing in Onha-ri two days ago,

728
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,500
and she's in her 20s.

729
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:34,840
Ms. Yoon went missing on her way home,

730
00:50:35,039 --> 00:50:37,269
but after her family reported her missing,

731
00:50:37,269 --> 00:50:40,480
the police deemed that she had simply run away from home,

732
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,610
and there are suspicions that the police neglected their duties...

733
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,949
to miss the golden hour of missing cases.

734
00:50:45,949 --> 00:50:47,820
(Yoon Ye Rim, 25 years old)

735
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:51,590
The Public Prosecutor General will make a public announcement.

736
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,159
Let's hear it now.

737
00:51:12,610 --> 00:51:13,840
Wait!

738
00:51:25,050 --> 00:51:26,190
Did you do well?

739
00:51:31,429 --> 00:51:32,829
I don't know.

740
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,400
What about you?

741
00:51:36,929 --> 00:51:38,429
There were too many questions I couldn't answer.

742
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:41,039
You'll be okay.

743
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,909
Those who fail the test are killed after sunset.

744
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:47,980
I think...

745
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,309
it will be one of us...

746
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:45,869
The side where the tail light goes out of view quickly.

747
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:49,340
They lost her at the three-way intersection,

748
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:51,309
and the RIU will start searching near the villas in Onha-ri.

749
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:59,480
(Onsang-ri, 3.6km, Onha-ri, 3.2km)

750
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:10,960
(Test, 90)

751
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,349
(Test, 75)

752
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,269
I... I scored 75.

753
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,809
I failed to score 90, so I'll study more.

754
00:54:34,809 --> 00:54:37,210
I have to score 90 in order to die.

755
00:54:38,679 --> 00:54:41,650
I can memorize everything. I'll try harder.

756
00:54:47,289 --> 00:54:49,219
Why isn't there anyone from the SWAT team?

757
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:51,389
The police agency dispatched them to identify the SUV.

758
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:54,300
We won't be able to help. Come on, let's move!

759
00:54:55,059 --> 00:54:56,130
I'll talk to you later.

760
00:55:10,349 --> 00:55:11,780
Please help!

761
00:55:24,429 --> 00:55:27,300
Was the Lord not aware of the foolish betrayal of humans?

762
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,230
This leads to a logical contradiction.

763
00:55:31,030 --> 00:55:32,769
So was the Lord incompetent...

764
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,199
or really heartless like we thought?

765
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:40,780
Almost all religions in the world...

766
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,610
made the mistake of literally translating...

767
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:47,320
the symbolic teachings of these types of prophets.

768
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:52,090
As a result, this led to their blind and foolish faith...

769
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:54,619
which led them to lead their descendants...

770
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,789
to the path of wrong belief.

771
00:55:58,059 --> 00:56:00,760
On the other hand, the words of truth...

772
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:02,599
that you're listening to today...

773
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,630
have a very simple message.

774
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:08,500
That symbols are merely symbols.

775
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:13,269
That will be all for today's...

776
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:14,539
words of truth.

777
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:19,050
May the Lord always be with you.

778
00:57:44,829 --> 00:57:47,199
(Onha-ri Villa Complex)

779
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:50,170
(Onha-ri)

780
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:52,840
(Mount Jeonghong)

781
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,409
(Onsang-ri)

782
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:25,340
How did you get up there?

783
00:58:25,809 --> 00:58:28,309
Quiet. I'll get out of here and call the police.

784
00:58:28,309 --> 00:58:30,650
- I want to go with you. - Please, be quiet.

785
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,510
Please, take me with you!

786
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,650
I need to get out to save you.

787
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:36,719
I'm going to die before that.

788
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:40,260
Hurry! Pull me up.

789
00:58:40,559 --> 00:58:43,059
Come on, take me with you!

790
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:46,590
Please, take me with you.

791
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,000
No, wait!

792
01:00:23,219 --> 01:00:24,929
Please, I'm begging you.

793
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:39,510
My Lord, I'm begging you. Please save my daughter.

794
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:58,610
(Onsang-ri, 11-gil)

795
01:03:59,409 --> 01:04:02,179
The perp will be hiding inside one of these 80 villas.

796
01:04:02,179 --> 01:04:04,510
Are you saying your initial profiling was correct?

797
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:06,610
Murder is a very important ritual for the perp.

798
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:07,719
There was an order...

799
01:04:07,719 --> 01:04:09,119
to dissolve the Special Investigation Team.

800
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:10,550
This won't end quietly.

801
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:11,889
I have one last favor.

802
01:04:11,889 --> 01:04:12,989
I can't grant you that.

803
01:04:12,989 --> 01:04:14,619
Doesn't that mean your investigation failed?

804
01:04:14,619 --> 01:04:16,860
How dare you attempt a trick in front of a professional?

805
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:18,489
The RIU is beating up the perp.

806
01:04:18,659 --> 01:04:19,730
Something is wrong.

807
01:04:19,789 --> 01:04:22,329
I knew we'd meet since you are Detective Superpower.

808
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:26,130
Shall we talk?
