(and incidents in this

5
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,469
(Two years ago)

6
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:10,579
How's Dong Baek?

7
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:12,180
Is he adjusting well?

8
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,609
Yes, yes.
He's pretty quiet these days.

9
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:16,879
It hasn't been that long since
he got kicked out from the RIU.

10
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,079
I see. Is that so?

11
00:01:21,989 --> 00:01:23,120
What about from now on?

12
00:01:23,989 --> 00:01:26,560
- Pardon?
- How do you think he'll be like?

13
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:29,829
He's an unusual guy,
that's for sure.

14
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:32,230
- He only does things his way.
- He's uncontrollable, right?

15
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,730
But he's good-natured,
so if people around him help...

16
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,840
What if they do?

17
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:44,209
The police will just become
his support,

18
00:01:44,209 --> 00:01:45,640
while Dong Baek would do
even better than now...

19
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,379
while stepping on everyone else.

20
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,590
- Captain Koo.
- Yes?

21
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,700
How about this?

22
00:02:05,829 --> 00:02:08,469
Instead of being someone
giving a hand to Dong Baek,

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,370
you should get his help.

24
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,800
- Well?
- Deputy Chief Lee...

25
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,439
It's better
for us as an organization,

26
00:02:14,439 --> 00:02:16,169
and for him too.

27
00:02:16,939 --> 00:02:18,639
Do you understand?

28
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,680
Yes, I understand
what you are saying.

29
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,150
If you understood,

30
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,389
get Dong Baek to write
his resignation letter.

31
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:34,229
First, make him
take off his uniform,

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,400
then we'll only use him
when we need to.

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,659
For example, we can ask
his consultation for violent crimes.

34
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,669
There's no way he'd accept it.

35
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:46,909
Didn't you say he'd always
listen to you?

36
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:51,340
I'm also not sure if this is
the right thing to do...

37
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,340
Captain Koo.

38
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,520
There are no right or wrong ways
in how an organization works.

39
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,349
There are only choices.

40
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:08,259
Go on.

41
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:21,469
Come on, boss.
It's a misunderstanding.

42
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:23,909
Old Man, we have guests.

43
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,780
- Gosh.
- Shoot.

44
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:34,419
That stings.

45
00:03:37,289 --> 00:03:39,120
Is it fun being a detective?

46
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,729
It's so much fun.

47
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:44,830
Do you know that the higher-ups
are scared because of you?

48
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,199
What is it? Is someone scared
because they committed a crime?

49
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:50,069
They lived in wealth
all their lives,

50
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:51,800
but their lives
are about to get ruined.

51
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,169
Who wouldn't be scared?

52
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:55,909
Are you telling me not to work
because some criminals...

53
00:03:55,909 --> 00:03:57,780
- are feeling uncomfortable?
- What I'm saying...

54
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,110
is there are more exciting things.

55
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,379
If you become a celebrity,

56
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:03,349
it'd be perfect since you're
so full of yourself.

57
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:05,080
It's no use trying to get rid of me.

58
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,090
No one's trying to get rid of you.

59
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,719
I won't quit until you retire.

60
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:13,490
Because of you,

61
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:16,129
I gave up on applying
the remedy for hair loss.

62
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:18,759
The stress will kill me
before it's my time.

63
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:22,129
Gosh. Take this off for me.

64
00:04:22,129 --> 00:04:23,129
Hand it over.

65
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,069
What is this?
Why are you suddenly touching me?

66
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,939
I'm not enjoying it.

67
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,379
Be gentle, it hurts.

68
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:35,379
It's cold.

69
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,990
Don't face the world that hates you,

70
00:04:43,589 --> 00:04:45,089
and go find your happiness...

71
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,089
while blaming me.

72
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:12,279
No...

73
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:17,089
Det. Oh.

74
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,360
Get him!

75
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:22,689
Captain Koo!

76
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:24,829
- Captain Koo!
- Come on.

77
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:27,069
No... Captain Koo...

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Captain Koo!

79
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,439
Captain Koo.

80
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:32,199
- Hurry.
- Are you okay?

81
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:35,769
What are you doing?
Hurry up and report it.

82
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,279
- Are you okay?
- Tell them to hurry!

83
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:42,410
- Is this 911?
- I'm okay.

84
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,949
It doesn't hurt at all.

85
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:45,019
Please hurry.

86
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:48,420
His condition?
Just hurry up and come here.

87
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:50,959
Captain Koo!

88
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:31,029
(Det. Oh Se Hoon)

89
00:06:31,029 --> 00:06:34,000
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed to voicemail.

90
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Please leave a message
after the beep.

91
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,410
(An innocent person will be
crucified instead of the sinner.)

92
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,720
- Dad.
- Honey.

93
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,290
Dad...

94
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:40,500
Mom, what do we do?

95
00:07:50,339 --> 00:07:52,610
How come Uncle Baek isn't here?

96
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
He's going to come.

97
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,850
He's a little busy right now.

98
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,420
What do we do?

99
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,170
Se Hoon.

100
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,170
We're being paged. We'll get going.

101
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:23,170
Okay.

102
00:08:23,509 --> 00:08:25,139
Call me when his operation finishes.

103
00:08:39,019 --> 00:08:40,929
They started operating
20 minutes ago.

104
00:08:43,529 --> 00:08:45,159
They'll need to watch
how he progresses.

105
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,799
This is unnecessary.
We're all cops.

106
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,070
Do you have to do this?

107
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,539
His life's at stake.

108
00:08:56,539 --> 00:08:57,539
Kwon Woon Jang.

109
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:20,730
That Old Man...

110
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:23,100
is so sluggish.
Why couldn't he dodge it?

111
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,740
He's trying to make me feel sorry.

112
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,809
Why did you let this happen
because of Dong Baek?

113
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:31,909
It's not Baek's fault.
It's my fault for interfering.

114
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:33,409
Why did you get involved?

115
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:35,009
You're an old man
who will retire in a few years.

116
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:37,679
He was fighting by himself.
How can an adult just watch?

117
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:40,549
He's not an ordinary kid.

118
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,289
No, he's not ordinary.

119
00:09:42,289 --> 00:09:44,460
He's extraordinarily rude.

120
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,190
- What?
- But I found out...

121
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,029
he's exactly the same as our kids.

122
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,259
He laughs when he's happy,

123
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:51,730
and he cries too.

124
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:53,360
He gets angry when he's mad.

125
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,970
It's only a part of him
that's different from everyone else.

126
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,570
He's just a human being
like all of us.

127
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,409
Also, he can't do anything
without me.

128
00:10:02,409 --> 00:10:04,240
Gosh. My goodness.

129
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,539
I mean it.

130
00:10:05,539 --> 00:10:06,879
- Gosh.
- Baek.

131
00:10:07,379 --> 00:10:08,610
Be quiet.

132
00:10:08,909 --> 00:10:10,649
Come on, it's going to air now.

133
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,379
- Captain Koo.
- Hey, Baek is here.

134
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,289
We came to watch
your interview on air.

135
00:10:16,289 --> 00:10:17,519
Why do you want to watch that?

136
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:18,690
It's on.

137
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:22,360
What is Det. Dong Baek like
as someone close to him?

138
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,929
In one sentence,
he's a beautiful young man.

139
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,259
I see.

140
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,029
What specifically would you say
is beautiful about him?

141
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,639
First of all, I'd like to say...

142
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:36,240
we're like father and son.

143
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,740
We truly care about each other.

144
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:42,679
The medication is making me drowsy.

145
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,379
Goodness.

146
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,149
Father. Father?

147
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,649
Why did you say that?

148
00:10:51,389 --> 00:10:54,559
- Father, get up.
- I'm so sleepy.

149
00:10:54,659 --> 00:10:55,759
Dad.

150
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,559
- Give me the remote, Dad.
- No.

151
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,159
Dad. Come on.

152
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,009
(Episode 15: Flesh and Blood)

153
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,350
- Goodness, honey!
- Dad!

154
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,289
- Dad!
- Open your eyes!

155
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:23,889
Please open your eyes!

156
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,519
- Please move aside.
- Open your eyes.

157
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,029
Open your eyes!

158
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:30,929
Why aren't you?

159
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,059
He collapsed as soon as we got here.

160
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:36,029
Don't you think
he's exhausting himself?

161
00:11:45,409 --> 00:11:46,610
He's awake.

162
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:51,019
Okay. I'll call you back.

163
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,389
Are you feeling okay?

164
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:58,120
You should rest for now.

165
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,590
How... How is the Old Man?

166
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:03,460
The surgery was a success but...

167
00:12:04,629 --> 00:12:06,029
Just tell me. I'm fine.

168
00:12:07,129 --> 00:12:08,470
He's still unconscious.

169
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,570
But he'll come around soon.

170
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:19,809
You can't go there.

171
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:22,350
The Intelligence Agency
and the prosecution are all there.

172
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,809
What about Ms. Eun?

173
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:24,950
They're tracking her down.

174
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:26,580
I just spoke
with Senior Superintendent Han.

175
00:12:28,419 --> 00:12:29,519
Detective Dong.

176
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,190
Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.

177
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:37,429
I'm just going to go
to the other room.

178
00:12:37,899 --> 00:12:39,029
I want to be alone.

179
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,129
Then I'll leave.

180
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,269
No. You should rest up as well.

181
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,600
Things may get hectic
in the near future.

182
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,889
Hello.

183
00:13:24,309 --> 00:13:25,480
Chief Prosecutor Woo?

184
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:31,879
I was meaning to visit you,
but with the given situation...

185
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,220
Can I have a word with you?

186
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,259
Say it now.

187
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,029
I know you're very interested
in Detective Dong.

188
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:48,200
But I'd appreciate it
if you turned it down a notch.

189
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:50,669
It's only natural for prosecutors
to have their eyes on criminals.

190
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,740
What's it to the NIS?

191
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,539
He hasn't been proven guilty yet.

192
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,370
But we'll soon find out.

193
00:13:57,539 --> 00:13:59,009
I know a criminal as well.

194
00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:02,350
While trying to cover up
a chief prosecutor's scandal,

195
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:04,049
he made the abducted victim die.

196
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:09,490
I'm only telling you this since
you're so interested in criminals.

197
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,169
It's nice to meet you,
Deputy Chief Lee.

198
00:14:29,539 --> 00:14:31,509
I'm Manager Kim from the NIS.

199
00:14:31,809 --> 00:14:33,539
What brings you here, Ms. Son?

200
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:36,480
You're more of a coward
than I thought you were.

201
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,950
I didn't think
you'd lie about your name.

202
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:39,620
Are you here because of Dong Baek?

203
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:43,019
You're quite good.

204
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,389
I'm afraid I can't help you.

205
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:49,029
Let's go.

206
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,159
You won't get your way.

207
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:56,899
Never.

208
00:14:57,769 --> 00:14:59,899
(Chairwoman Hwang Pil Sun)

209
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:10,879
Hello, I'm Woo Seok Do...

210
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:11,980
from the Central District
Prosecutor's Office.

211
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:29,070
The Public Prosecutor General
told me to do my best to aid you.

212
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,139
Since the criminal
has been identified,

213
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:39,809
he'll be dead soon.

214
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:43,210
- What about the other guy?
- Dong Baek as well.

215
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,720
But before that,

216
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,179
there's something we need
to take care of.

217
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:49,990
I need the prosecution's word.

218
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,860
- Our word?
- A non-indictment.

219
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,860
Dong Baek's death
will cause a great commotion.

220
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,830
The press will join in as well,

221
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,470
and the prosecution
will use that opportunity...

222
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,600
to attack.

223
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:08,240
So you want me to promise you...

224
00:16:08,809 --> 00:16:10,169
that we won't hold you responsible?

225
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:15,809
I can't make this decision
on my own.

226
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:18,350
I've already spoken
with the Public Prosecutor General.

227
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:22,049
Then why are you asking me?

228
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,690
He's not competent enough.

229
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,320
- Sorry?
- The Public Prosecutor General.

230
00:16:27,889 --> 00:16:31,730
He shouldn't have allowed this
to happen from the get-go.

231
00:16:31,929 --> 00:16:34,529
We look like criminals
who are scheming together.

232
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,700
- I apologize.
- I don't need to hear it.

233
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,740
So what do you say?

234
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:46,639
Will you allow the prosecution
to continue cleaning up...

235
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,250
other people's messes?

236
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,149
No, ma'am. I'll change that.

237
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:01,429
I'll make sure you won't need
to worry about such things anymore.

238
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,200
I hope...

239
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:08,599
you'll forever have this drive.

240
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,470
The Public Prosecutor General...

241
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,339
was exactly like you six years ago.

242
00:17:20,809 --> 00:17:22,509
The moment you lose that motivation,

243
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,279
the power will no longer be yours.

244
00:17:34,829 --> 00:17:38,029
Former Assemblyman Bang Jun Seok,
who was assaulted by Detective Dong,

245
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:39,759
has volunteered to help
find his wife...

246
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:43,130
despite his doctors' dissuasion.

247
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:45,599
If Detective Dong
is truly an accomplice,

248
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:48,109
I beg him...

249
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:50,140
to let my wife return
safe and sound.

250
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:53,640
The National Police Agency took
Detective Dong's assault seriously.

251
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,150
They have stated that
he will be arrested immediately.

252
00:17:56,150 --> 00:17:58,180
Meanwhile, Detective Dong attacked
Assemblyman Bang...

253
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,180
during a live broadcast.

254
00:18:00,349 --> 00:18:04,319
This has supported rumors
about his being an accomplice.

255
00:18:04,589 --> 00:18:07,089
Some people suspect...

256
00:18:07,089 --> 00:18:09,390
that the Eraser
warned Detective Dong...

257
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:12,799
as a way to disguise the fact...

258
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,930
that they were scheming together.

259
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,769
This has only aroused more fear...

260
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,809
I'll treat your wound.

261
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,259
What kind of relationship is it?

262
00:18:46,529 --> 00:18:47,630
Sorry?

263
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,299
You and Moon Yong Gwang.

264
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:55,740
I don't understand.

265
00:18:58,339 --> 00:18:59,680
Did you think I wouldn't find out?

266
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,750
- It's nothing.
- Then why...

267
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:05,720
did you go to the hospital?

268
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,890
That was because...

269
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:13,619
Have you two joined hands?

270
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:16,990
Did he promise you money...

271
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:18,859
if you helped him kill me?

272
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,630
Look at me.

273
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,210
I said, look at me.

274
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:32,380
If that's not the case,

275
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,880
is it an intimate relationship?

276
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,180
No, sir.

277
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:40,619
There's nothing between us.

278
00:19:48,029 --> 00:19:49,829
You've changed.

279
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:52,430
In the past,

280
00:19:53,559 --> 00:19:56,000
it looked like
you wanted something from me.

281
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,210
I can't believe you got together
with a scumbag like him.

282
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,539
You're really cheap.

283
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,680
I'll be going now.

284
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,190
What a shame.

285
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,920
Once my wife died,

286
00:20:20,589 --> 00:20:23,660
I was going to add you to the list
of whom I was going to marry next.

287
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,880
Keep an eye on her.

288
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,240
Yes, sir.

289
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,279
What are you up to?

290
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:24,660
I'm... Just...

291
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,660
Just what?

292
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,559
I was just thinking.

293
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:31,430
Let me guess.

294
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:42,970
Come on.

295
00:21:43,609 --> 00:21:45,839
What? You were thinking about me.

296
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,150
Am I wrong?

297
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,880
Yes.

298
00:21:50,349 --> 00:21:51,349
Darn it.

299
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:55,650
I envy you.

300
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:59,660
I wish I could read
other people's minds as well.

301
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,289
It's nothing good.

302
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:06,329
Why not? It sounds good to me.

303
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,660
That's not true.

304
00:22:09,569 --> 00:22:11,099
People's memories...

305
00:22:11,599 --> 00:22:13,869
aren't just full of good ones
like you assume.

306
00:22:15,339 --> 00:22:18,009
There are countless things
I wish I never found out.

307
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,849
I'm sure there's also the opposite.

308
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:30,319
I can't quite remember.

309
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:33,359
Here.

310
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:36,430
You can read me if you want.

311
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:38,160
You can read my entire memory.

312
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:40,230
These days,

313
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,970
I especially think about you a lot.

314
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,369
Hey, you're smiling.

315
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:53,009
See? Thanks to your ability,
you made both of us happy.

316
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,319
Baek.

317
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:01,720
Perhaps,

318
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:05,720
your ability could make
many people happy.

319
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:08,990
And when that happens,

320
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,460
the world may change for the better.

321
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:15,470
Really?

322
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:21,200
Do you think that's possible?

323
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:42,990
I'd like to testify.

324
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:47,730
Please spare me.

325
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:49,869
Please?

326
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,940
I've saved...

327
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:56,640
countless lives already.

328
00:23:57,339 --> 00:23:59,480
I know you're a good person.

329
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,480
So please save me as well.

330
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,349
Even good individuals...

331
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,450
can turn evil.

332
00:24:08,519 --> 00:24:11,990
If anything,
I was too good of a person.

333
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,890
So it feels unfair...

334
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:18,799
that I've felt so much pain.

335
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,430
Such a thing...

336
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,029
shouldn't have happened...

337
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,869
to either me...

338
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,079
or my daughter.

339
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:35,950
Don't you think so?

340
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,450
20 years ago,

341
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,519
I hurried back home
after going abroad...

342
00:24:45,759 --> 00:24:47,559
to rescue those from an earthquake.

343
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:51,759
My daughter had died.

344
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,940
But it wasn't like any other deaths.

345
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:03,609
As a firefighter,

346
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:05,809
I've witnessed many deaths.

347
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:10,049
Even when my wife had passed away,

348
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,720
I wasn't as afraid
as I was when my daughter died.

349
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:18,089
At first,

350
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,990
they said she committed suicide.

351
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,559
But...

352
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,059
they were wrong.

353
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:30,930
I wish...

354
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:35,069
I never found out.

355
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,240
Yoo Ah Yeong?

356
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,750
So Phillip?

357
00:25:46,349 --> 00:25:49,220
Darn it. What are you doing here?

358
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,349
I was taking some photos.

359
00:25:51,859 --> 00:25:53,420
What about you?

360
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:55,759
My friend owns this area.

361
00:25:56,529 --> 00:25:57,930
All of this...

362
00:25:59,859 --> 00:26:01,230
belongs to him.

363
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:03,400
Bang Jun Seok.

364
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:05,299
Don't you know him?

365
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,269
Oh, right.
You go to a different school now.

366
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:12,710
Darn it. I forgot.

367
00:26:13,309 --> 00:26:14,309
Have you been...

368
00:26:15,349 --> 00:26:16,880
drinking?

369
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,250
We took something even better.

370
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,329
I'll be going now.

371
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:38,230
Darn it.

372
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,670
You should pay the toll...

373
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:41,740
if you are
in someone else's territory.

374
00:26:44,609 --> 00:26:45,609
What?

375
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:47,839
Do you want some?

376
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:52,579
This will take you to paradise.

377
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:11,799
They trampled all over her.

378
00:27:12,369 --> 00:27:15,970
But they continued
to commit more sins.

379
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:24,680
Who are you?

380
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,049
What do you want?

381
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:41,329
Moon Yong Dae?

382
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,200
Darn it.

383
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:50,809
Where's Ah Yeong?

384
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,250
You little...

385
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:42,059
Your gaze disgusts me.

386
00:28:52,039 --> 00:28:53,940
They set him on fire.

387
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:57,470
And while he was still alive,

388
00:28:58,009 --> 00:29:00,980
they pushed him off a cliff.

389
00:29:02,079 --> 00:29:03,980
That night,

390
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,849
two children fell victims...

391
00:29:08,519 --> 00:29:11,420
to Bang Jun Seok, your husband!

392
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:18,390
My daughter's friend
died that very night.

393
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,230
But my daughter...

394
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,529
Hey.

395
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:53,630
What brought you all the way here?

396
00:29:58,569 --> 00:30:02,210
Master Jun Seok,
you need to wake up...

397
00:30:03,369 --> 00:30:05,480
if you don't want to spend
the rest of your life in jail.

398
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:14,819
My daughter survived.

399
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,190
Although her body and mind...

400
00:30:17,519 --> 00:30:19,920
were trampled on!

401
00:30:21,589 --> 00:30:23,089
She didn't die.

402
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:28,059
(OB-GYN, Jung Hyung Sik)

403
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,440
So you didn't really resist.

404
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,220
Ah Yeong. I believe you,

405
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:50,220
but your story could be interpreted
in a different way too.

406
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,759
Your father would be so upset
if he finds out.

407
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,519
Don't you agree?

408
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,630
You know Moon Yong Dae, don't you?

409
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:03,000
I shouldn't tell you this,

410
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,470
but he died.

411
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,539
He committed suicide.

412
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:17,450
Do you remember
where you hung out with the boys?

413
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,480
He died right beside it.

414
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:25,319
I wonder if he saw something there.

415
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:58,519
Because she survived,

416
00:32:00,089 --> 00:32:01,619
she died every day!

417
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,430
My daughter!

418
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:09,930
I have a child too.

419
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,700
If you spare me,
I'll do anything you want.

420
00:32:15,869 --> 00:32:17,440
But,

421
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,980
after going through such a thing,

422
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:24,180
I had a realization.

423
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:28,690
There's no reason...

424
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,720
for my daughter's misfortune.

425
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,529
I heard about Captain Koo.

426
00:33:19,099 --> 00:33:20,599
The one
who did that to Captain Koo...

427
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:22,670
Cheon Ki Soo...

428
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,380
was trying to hit me.

429
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:32,349
Deputy Chief Lee
gave the order to fire.

430
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:36,549
He was okay with anyone being shot
to death aside from the hostage.

431
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,359
- Det. Dong.
- What?

432
00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:46,299
Why do you think
I'm telling you this right now?

433
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:49,930
I'm telling you...

434
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,339
it's not just the Eraser
we're up against.

435
00:33:54,069 --> 00:33:57,509
Especially you.
You have too many enemies.

436
00:33:58,309 --> 00:33:59,339
I know.

437
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:01,609
- I'm used to it.
- Don't get used to it.

438
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,079
You must stay on your toes.

439
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:04,680
There's no reason
to blame yourself either.

440
00:34:05,619 --> 00:34:08,519
If I could, I want to ask you
to stay away from the field.

441
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:12,619
You know very well I won't listen.

442
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:15,960
Yes. I'm telling you everything
because I know.

443
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,929
I don't want you to get shocked
at the last minute.

444
00:34:18,559 --> 00:34:19,699
Are you trying to be considerate?

445
00:34:19,929 --> 00:34:22,699
No. I'm giving you advice...

446
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,699
based on my profiling of you.

447
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:29,309
Considerate advice. It's nice.

448
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:30,809
I'll make it an exception
to remember it.

449
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:32,309
I'm so thankful.

450
00:34:34,539 --> 00:34:36,579
- What about Yoo Soon Nam?
- We're in pursuit.

451
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:38,510
We confirmed
he left for the suburbs.

452
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:42,789
(Situation Room)

453
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:47,059
(Situation Room)

454
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,190
Yes?

455
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:57,869
I'll come along.

456
00:34:57,969 --> 00:35:00,440
No. There's something else
I need you to do for me.

457
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:03,369
Please take care of it.

458
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,280
They found Yoo Soon Nam's
whereabouts. Let's go.

459
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,659
What's the exact location?

460
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,559
There's a warehouse under
Yoo's father-in-law's name...

461
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,730
near the Sochung River.

462
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:31,199
It matches the direction of the car.

463
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:32,769
I just texted you the coordinates.

464
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,139
SWAT will arrive in 20 minutes.

465
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,239
Okay. Thank you.

466
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,019
What exclusive?

467
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:53,190
Det. Dong Baek's testimony
which tells...

468
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,389
the truth about the Eraser.

469
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:01,730
- "A testimony"?
- What if he was wrongfully accused?

470
00:36:02,199 --> 00:36:04,630
- What?
- What if all the murders...

471
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:07,269
were caused by the conspiracy
of a specific rich family?

472
00:36:07,769 --> 00:36:08,940
We need to watch it first.

473
00:36:09,170 --> 00:36:10,239
Where's the video?

474
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:14,440
I have a feeling you might kill
an exclusive to kill Det. Dong.

475
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,179
- Are you joking?
- Answer me first.

476
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:19,119
Will you air...

477
00:36:19,849 --> 00:36:21,920
Det. Dong's testimony as it is?

478
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,489
Are you out of your mind?

479
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,260
- Kang Ji Eun.
- Yes?

480
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:32,500
What's the most important thing
for a reporter?

481
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,400
It's the truth.

482
00:36:36,969 --> 00:36:38,269
Truth.

483
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:40,070
We're all reporters, aren't we?

484
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:45,309
That's why we must tell everyone
Det. Dong was wrongly accused.

485
00:36:47,139 --> 00:36:48,280
The truth...

486
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,420
doesn't come from the outside.
It starts here.

487
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:57,650
We're the people who make
these important truths.

488
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:01,190
And the truth we must make
right now...

489
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:06,329
is to rid of that mutant
called Dong Baek from society.

490
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:08,199
Okay?

491
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:13,800
Ji Eun. You're still the youngest
and you're clueless,

492
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:15,500
so we'll give you one more chance.

493
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:19,440
So stop being stubborn,
and bring the video to us.

494
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:22,880
- I can't do that.
- Darn it!

495
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:27,780
Hey, you can't hide information
you got as one of our reporters.

496
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,389
You'll get criminal and civil suits!

497
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:30,889
I think you misunderstood.

498
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:33,789
I was the one giving you
the last chance.

499
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:36,929
I'll get going.

500
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:39,199
Kang Ji Eun!

501
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:41,559
Hey, Ji Eun. Wait, wait.

502
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:46,269
Hey! You'll have to compensate for
the damages. Your life will be over!

503
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,599
Kang Ji Eun!

504
00:37:49,670 --> 00:37:50,769
Gosh.

505
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,289
SWAT is approaching,

506
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:14,059
but we haven't confirmed
the condition of the hostage.

507
00:38:30,449 --> 00:38:33,219
I give you permission
to kill in an emergency.

508
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:34,750
Roger.

509
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,690
Everyone, approach.
Firing is permitted.

510
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,909
He never revealed his position
so openly before.

511
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:39,619
This isn't the place.

512
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:43,349
(SWAT)

513
00:39:46,389 --> 00:39:48,619
We've entered the building,
but no one's inside.

514
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,480
What's going on?

515
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:11,550
- Let's go.
- What's your plan?

516
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,179
I have a place in mind.

517
00:40:13,179 --> 00:40:15,679
I looked into it and you were right.

518
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:19,050
The place where Yoo Ah Yeong
committed suicide 20 years ago...

519
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:20,460
is nearby.

520
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,130
Okay. Send me the exact location.

521
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,159
Okay.

522
00:40:24,829 --> 00:40:26,559
Should I ask for support?

523
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,130
Ask just the RIU
without the other teams finding out.

524
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,230
Okay.

525
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,940
How did you know?

526
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,840
Like it is with most serial murders,

527
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,739
the Eraser sees murders
as a form of rituals.

528
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:40,110
I thought there must be a reason
why he came all the way here...

529
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:41,739
while exposing his movements.

530
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:07,670
Hey.

531
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:10,039
As for Uncle Baek...

532
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,010
What I mean is...

533
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,210
I know he's busy right now.

534
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,880
Yes.

535
00:41:21,019 --> 00:41:22,789
Mom told me...

536
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:24,949
Uncle Baek is 10 times busier now...

537
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,559
because Dad got hurt.

538
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:30,630
Yes. She's right.

539
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:35,500
But I heard Uncle Baek
can't do anything alone...

540
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,570
without you and Dad.

541
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:42,300
Yes. She's right about that too.

542
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,139
(Reporter Kang Ji Eun)

543
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,980
Just a minute.

544
00:41:53,349 --> 00:41:56,119
Det. Oh, will you help me?

545
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,389
It's something about Det. Dong.

546
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:01,690
Of course, I will.

547
00:43:00,019 --> 00:43:01,019
Where's Eun Soo Gyeong?

548
00:43:05,289 --> 00:43:06,360
Shoot.

549
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,130
- She's still alive for now.
- Hand her over.

550
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:13,099
Take her if you can.

551
00:43:13,099 --> 00:43:14,159
Yoo Soon Nam.

552
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:17,599
What do you get out of
hurting Eun Soo Gyeong?

553
00:43:22,639 --> 00:43:24,039
Det. Dong Baek.

554
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,380
Senior Superintendent Han Sun Mi.

555
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:28,210
What about you two?

556
00:43:28,679 --> 00:43:31,079
What do you get out of
saving Eun Soo Gyeong?

557
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,820
Relief from having stopped
an innocent from being crucified?

558
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:38,320
Perhaps something unsubstantial
like the sense of justice?

559
00:43:39,519 --> 00:43:41,219
What is it that you want to say?

560
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:45,090
There was a time when I thought
those things were important too.

561
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:48,500
However, those feelings...

562
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:52,739
only remain with humans like us.

563
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:54,670
Enough with your nonsense.

564
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:57,110
People forget easily.

565
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,269
Did a police officer
catch a criminal?

566
00:43:59,909 --> 00:44:02,409
Did a firefighter save someone?

567
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:07,250
How long do you think most people
would be moved by such a thing?

568
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:09,849
Can it last a day at least?

569
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:13,360
We're throwing ourselves
to move others...

570
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,119
but these feelings won't even last
for a day.

571
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,960
Isn't it such a waste?

572
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,559
It's not a waste at all.

573
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:22,530
You two know it already, don't you?

574
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:27,369
Your righteousness
won't change the world.

575
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:30,510
The more you get involved,

576
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:33,980
the more the world will hate you.

577
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,210
- Fire him!
- Stay still.

578
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:39,010
We were ordered to disband
the Special Investigation Team.

579
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:41,349
Go away!

580
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,920
They're trying to humiliate you.

581
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:47,559
You'll be questioned at a hearing
being aired live.

582
00:44:49,190 --> 00:44:50,389
Dong Baek.

583
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:52,460
Han Sun Mi.

584
00:44:54,260 --> 00:44:57,030
If you truly want the world
to be better,

585
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:02,139
what this world needs
is a true leader.

586
00:45:03,010 --> 00:45:05,769
Not the husband of this woman,

587
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:10,179
his shallow mother who believes
money can solve everything,

588
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:14,280
nor her parasites from prosecution,
police, and the press!

589
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:16,789
There are countless
pieces of garbage!

590
00:45:19,559 --> 00:45:21,760
Not those fakes.

591
00:45:22,889 --> 00:45:24,489
We need a real leader.

592
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:27,099
A true idol!

593
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,269
Also, if anyone opposes the idol,

594
00:45:31,469 --> 00:45:34,300
they must fear at all times
that they could be crucified...

595
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,409
no matter who they are.

596
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:40,909
The fear towards the idol...

597
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:44,210
is the beginning of justice.

598
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,219
Eun Soo Gyeong is actually...

599
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:54,090
dying an honorable death.

600
00:45:54,090 --> 00:45:55,090
You're crazy.

601
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:01,500
What are you thinking?

602
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:05,630
Why is he trying to control us
with something like that?

603
00:46:08,769 --> 00:46:10,369
There's something else
that's strange.

604
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,940
Until now,
the Eraser took his revenge...

605
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,809
by reenacting the way Yoo Ah Yeong
and Moon Yong Dae died.

606
00:46:14,809 --> 00:46:16,510
No!

607
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:19,409
He kills like it's a ritual.
He does it compulsively.

608
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,420
He wouldn't kill Eun Soo Gyeong
out of his pattern.

609
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:26,289
She's not in there.

610
00:46:27,059 --> 00:46:29,489
Then where is she?

611
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:31,789
Should I make a move?

612
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:34,760
What if he's really the Eraser?

613
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:40,070
Sure. Go ahead and kill her.

614
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:42,400
I'll support your intentions.

615
00:46:43,409 --> 00:46:45,269
- Do you mean it?
- Yes.

616
00:46:46,510 --> 00:46:48,679
But, I have a condition.

617
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:51,380
Before you kill her,

618
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:53,780
I'd like to read her memories.

619
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,250
I have a lot of grudges
against Bang Jun Seok...

620
00:46:58,550 --> 00:47:00,619
and Hwang Pil Sun.
I need more information.

621
00:47:00,619 --> 00:47:03,630
You can kill her or spare her
after that.

622
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:07,059
What do you think?
It's simple, right?

623
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,030
Do you think
I'd fall for your scheme?

624
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:13,369
Come on.

625
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,099
If you're really the Eraser,

626
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:17,840
you'd take control over us
no matter what the situation is.

627
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:19,340
Am I wrong?

628
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:23,349
So hurry up and open it.
It's not that difficult, is it?

629
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:30,719
You're not the Eraser, are you?

630
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,329
If you move,

631
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,090
she'll really die.

632
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:41,400
Don't mind him.
It's not Eun Soo Gyeong inside.

633
00:47:56,949 --> 00:47:58,679
Eun Soo Gyeong is in the building!

634
00:49:04,179 --> 00:49:06,449
Tell me. Who's the Eraser?

635
00:49:06,449 --> 00:49:07,449
Me.

636
00:49:07,849 --> 00:49:09,219
Spit it out.

637
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,920
Me. I'm the Eraser!

638
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,690
- Yoo Soon Nam!
- What I said today...

639
00:49:14,789 --> 00:49:16,960
are his words.

640
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,429
I never came here today.

641
00:49:19,429 --> 00:49:21,400
The one who came here...

642
00:49:22,099 --> 00:49:23,829
was him.

643
00:49:24,369 --> 00:49:26,130
Are you going to keep this up?

644
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,670
Remember...

645
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,170
what you heard today.

646
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:36,139
Your ways will never help
the world become a better place.

647
00:49:36,409 --> 00:49:39,349
And if the world doesn't become
a better place,

648
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:43,019
you're merely an alien
who will be persecuted...

649
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:46,489
for the rest of your life!

650
00:50:52,789 --> 00:50:54,619
- Cheon Ki Soo, put down your gun!
- Put it down!

651
00:51:01,429 --> 00:51:02,530
Put it down.

652
00:51:25,420 --> 00:51:26,590
No!

653
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:31,829
Hey.

654
00:51:32,829 --> 00:51:35,360
Dong Baek! Are you okay?

655
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:39,699
He's been shot. Hurry up and call
an ambulance.

656
00:51:39,699 --> 00:51:41,800
Rescue Team.
Someone's been shot on the roof.

657
00:52:08,159 --> 00:52:10,070
Dong Baek! Wake up!

658
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:12,170
- Open your eyes!
- Call an ambulance.

659
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,469
- Wake up!
- Darn.

660
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,239
Press down on his wound!
Darn it!

661
00:52:24,679 --> 00:52:25,750
Yes.

662
00:52:25,750 --> 00:52:26,920
The Eraser is dead,

663
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,619
and Dong Baek has been shot
and is in the hospital.

664
00:52:29,989 --> 00:52:32,650
- How's his condition?
- It doesn't look good.

665
00:52:34,219 --> 00:52:35,989
- Go check.
- But...

666
00:52:37,590 --> 00:52:39,289
the NIS suddenly intervened.

667
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,980
What shall I do?

668
00:52:54,909 --> 00:52:56,980
- Follow them secretly.
- Yes, sir.

669
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:03,889
Can you withdraw the article?

670
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:06,989
- Right now?
- Can you cancel the article?

671
00:53:07,159 --> 00:53:10,059
Please, you need to withdraw it
by this evening.

672
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:11,559
I know what you mean.

673
00:53:11,929 --> 00:53:13,059
But that's...

674
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:21,099
This video includes Det. Dong Baek's
testimony who knows...

675
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:23,170
- the truth about the Eraser Case.
- Ms. Hwang, I'm here.

676
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,639
I wish to testify.

677
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:28,309
This is based on the memories...

678
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:31,150
I've been able to gain
while chasing the Eraser.

679
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:35,880
This story started
a very long time ago.

680
00:53:37,150 --> 00:53:38,289
20 years ago,

681
00:53:39,289 --> 00:53:42,960
a man trampled on and killed
innocent young people.

682
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:46,760
And his mom also killed
all the remaining family members...

683
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:50,329
in order to hide her son's crime.

684
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:53,570
They are...

685
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:57,969
the ones who tormented
the innocent Eun Soo Gyeong.

686
00:53:59,139 --> 00:54:01,079
It's former assemblyman
Bang Jun Seok...

687
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:04,710
and Chairwoman Hwang Pil Sun.

688
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:08,119
Also,

689
00:54:09,449 --> 00:54:12,820
they ordered Chief Cheon Ki Soo
to cover up all the murders...

690
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:15,659
(Det. Dong testifies
about the Eraser Case)

691
00:54:15,659 --> 00:54:16,789
together with
Deputy Chief Lee Shin Woong...

692
00:54:18,090 --> 00:54:19,559
of the National Police Agency.

693
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:24,699
They bribed numerous people
in order to cover up...

694
00:54:24,969 --> 00:54:28,469
the rape and murder committed by
Assemblyman Bang and his friends.

695
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:32,809
They falsified testimonies and
disguised murder as an accident...

696
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:35,909
and also insulted the girl
who was raped...

697
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:38,210
with unspeakable words...

698
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:40,719
and continued to kill her...

699
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:42,619
two, three times.

700
00:54:44,219 --> 00:54:45,219
And as per their orders,

701
00:54:45,219 --> 00:54:47,489
Chief Cheon Ki Soo
covered up the murders...

702
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:50,159
together with...

703
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:53,460
Deputy Chief Lee Shin Woong
of the National Police Agency.

704
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,500
You better delete what you posted
on the internet now.

705
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:59,170
No, I won't delete it.

706
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,340
Kang Ji Eun. Do you think
you'll get out of this safely?

707
00:55:03,610 --> 00:55:04,809
So be it.

708
00:55:05,670 --> 00:55:09,280
The most important thing
for a reporter is the truth.

709
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,409
Hey, Kang Ji Eun!

710
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,119
Wow.

711
00:55:16,550 --> 00:55:17,920
You're so cool, Ms. Kang.

712
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:21,289
Cool, but unemployed as of now.

713
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:23,829
I'll be like that too from now on.

714
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,530
I'll act more confidently...

715
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:30,530
towards Baek and Captain Koo.

716
00:55:31,199 --> 00:55:32,530
Call me if you get fired.

717
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,099
Okay.

718
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,469
(Det. Dong Baek's
Shocking Testimony)

719
00:55:38,639 --> 00:55:40,210
Do you think Baek will be okay?

720
00:55:40,739 --> 00:55:43,880
But it seems the situation
has already gotten out of hand.

721
00:55:44,409 --> 00:55:45,610
He'll be okay.

722
00:55:46,179 --> 00:55:49,679
There are many people
who are rooting for Det. Dong.

723
00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:55,820
I should've followed him when I knew
he headed straight to the scene.

724
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:00,360
He needs someone next to him
who can stop him.

725
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,969
Are you worried he might get hurt?

726
00:56:05,269 --> 00:56:08,139
No. In case he beats someone up
again.

727
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:12,170
He doesn't get hurt easily.

728
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:14,309
Even if he does,
he jumps right back up.

729
00:56:14,309 --> 00:56:16,110
He just pulls out the IVs and...

730
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,010
I am worried.

731
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:22,280
Senior Superintendent Han went
with him, so he'll be fine.

732
00:56:22,949 --> 00:56:24,050
I guess so.

733
00:56:49,409 --> 00:56:50,510
What are you doing?

734
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:52,980
Get rid of that video now!

735
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:55,650
It's already been posted
on foreign servers.

736
00:56:55,949 --> 00:56:57,320
I'll look for a way.

737
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,059
My goodness.

738
00:57:11,670 --> 00:57:12,829
Darn it.

739
00:57:17,739 --> 00:57:18,840
Mr. Cho.

740
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:33,690
What do you think you're doing?

741
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:39,929
I clearly warned you 20 years ago.

742
00:57:40,699 --> 00:57:42,099
That if you didn't stay
on your toes,

743
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:44,900
you'll rot in jail
for the rest of your life.

744
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,769
- You think you can get out of this?
- We need to...

745
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,269
sort out this mess first.

746
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:52,710
It's impossible...

747
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:57,010
to sweep everything under the rug
now.

748
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,150
Do you think there's anything
impossible for me...

749
00:58:02,619 --> 00:58:03,949
in this country?

750
00:58:05,619 --> 00:58:07,590
Just keep doing
what you've always done...

751
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:09,559
and follow my orders.

752
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,789
- I make the decisions.
- No.

753
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:16,929
I'll do it my way now.

754
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:19,199
From now on,

755
00:58:20,070 --> 00:58:22,199
this doesn't just involve you
and your family...

756
00:58:23,670 --> 00:58:24,969
but me as well.

757
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:34,449
Now that the situation is
getting out of hand,

758
00:58:34,449 --> 00:58:36,480
you want to cut ties with me?

759
00:58:38,449 --> 00:58:41,119
Do you think you're the only one
who's under my control...

760
00:58:41,119 --> 00:58:42,690
in this country?

761
00:58:42,690 --> 00:58:43,960
Who do you think...

762
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:50,429
was the one who made that possible?

763
00:59:11,289 --> 00:59:15,190
Det. Dong who was shot two weeks ago
and fell into a coma...

764
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:18,289
is apparently in
a very critical condition.

765
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:20,230
According to a number
of medical experts,

766
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:23,429
Det. Dong still hasn't regained
consciousness...

767
00:59:23,429 --> 00:59:25,000
and the international medical team
that arrived...

768
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,630
right after the incident...

769
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:31,070
is also skeptical about
the possibility of his recovery.

770
00:59:50,159 --> 00:59:52,489
Are you going to keep
looking at me like that?

771
00:59:56,599 --> 00:59:57,730
You're okay?

772
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,110
Then...

773
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:10,710
Then what?

774
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:13,719
Did you think I was
half-dead or something?

775
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,320
- But the news said...
- What?

776
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:19,119
Did it say I was going to die?

777
01:00:24,030 --> 01:00:25,590
The public opinion has shifted.

778
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:28,199
A special investigation on
Hwang Pil Sun and Bang Jun Seok...

779
01:00:28,199 --> 01:00:29,559
is about to begin.

780
01:00:30,530 --> 01:00:32,000
Although it won't be easy.

781
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:35,400
Everything will go well.

782
01:00:36,199 --> 01:00:38,170
Your testimony played
a crucial role.

783
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:44,980
What's wrong?

784
01:00:47,219 --> 01:00:48,349
Something...

785
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,719
just crossed my mind.

786
01:00:52,519 --> 01:00:53,519
What is it?

787
01:00:53,789 --> 01:00:56,920
If I was alive and healthy,

788
01:00:57,260 --> 01:00:59,659
would this have been solved
like this?

789
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,829
I tried so desperately to solve
this case when I was alive,

790
01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:07,739
but now that people think
I'm dying,

791
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:11,070
it feels as if everything is being
solved so simply.

792
01:01:12,739 --> 01:01:13,739
Am I...

793
01:01:14,139 --> 01:01:16,440
The more you get involved,

794
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:19,349
the more the world will hate you.

795
01:01:19,349 --> 01:01:22,920
You're merely an alien
who will be persecuted...

796
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,889
for the rest of your life!

797
01:01:26,449 --> 01:01:28,190
Am I really someone
who will be praised...

798
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:29,920
once I disappear from this world?

799
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:37,599
It's just that what he said kept
popping into my head.

800
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:43,039
You should get some rest.

801
01:01:44,010 --> 01:01:46,070
Stop agonizing over something
meaningless.

802
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:48,210
Just think about recovering
and coming back to work.

803
01:02:05,789 --> 01:02:06,789
Hey.

804
01:02:07,230 --> 01:02:08,230
Hey!

805
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:12,230
What?

806
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:15,139
Det. Dong Baek?

807
01:02:26,710 --> 01:02:28,349
(If you want to know the truth,
come to the place it all started.)

808
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:28,139
Seo Yi Soo.

809
01:04:34,179 --> 01:04:37,679
From now on,
I will tell you the real truth.

810
01:04:39,349 --> 01:04:40,349
My brother...

811
01:04:41,349 --> 01:04:42,519
Dong Baek.

812
01:05:27,559 --> 01:05:29,159
Those are records about
someone with supernatural powers.

813
01:05:29,159 --> 01:05:31,369
Someone besides Det. Dong Baek.

814
01:05:31,369 --> 01:05:33,630
Track down Det. Dong's location.
Now.

815
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:36,599
Tell me everything you people know.

816
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:38,940
How can I believe you?

817
01:05:39,539 --> 01:05:40,780
I think...

818
01:05:41,809 --> 01:05:43,179
that's when I realized it.

819
01:05:43,179 --> 01:05:44,650
Is that why you killed people...

820
01:05:45,380 --> 01:05:46,750
and began your revenge?

821
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:50,119
If you think I'm a monster,
kill me. Kill me!
