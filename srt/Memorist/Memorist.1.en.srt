Just tell us where the hideout is, and you'll live.

What would you do if you were me?

9
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:16,609

in exactly three hours.

Hey. Do you want to die?

12
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,790
No, I want to live.

13
00:01:28,459 --> 00:01:31,500
No wonder you couldn't catch a thug who turned your family...

14
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,099
into a vegetable. You're so ignorant.

- You jerk! - Let go of him!

17
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,370
I'm going to catch that punk and kill him...

What?

21
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,920
My boss was on the run 10 years ago...

22
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,329
when he drove over a newbie from your unit.

23

You were partners with that clumsy guy,

- right? - Shut your mouth!

25
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,710
You told me to talk earlier. What do you want me to do?

26
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,110
Should I shut my mouth or open it?

28
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,840
Come out here.

Come out.

30
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:40,770
Leave it to me. I'll give him a lesson.

Do you want to go behind bars and get us all fired?

32
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,900
Then should we just give up?

33

for obstruction of justice, accidental homicide,

62

and incitation of murder.

63
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,129
I'll be arresting you on behalf of the detective...

You waited for a decade. Two hours is nothing.

(Episode 1: A claw hammer)

70
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,519
A 20-year-old man who was on trial made headlines...

71
00:06:55,519 --> 00:06:58,160
when he claimed to have supernatural power.

72
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,189
He shocked the nation by claiming that...

73
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:02,730
he could read others' memories just by physically touching them.

74
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,360
The department of justice decided to verify this.

75
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,000
Their writings and their brainwaves are identical.

76
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,439
The NIS and many researchers have participated...

77
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:14,240
in this large-scale experiment.

78
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,310
This is the moment of truth.

79
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:21,149
His memory-scanning superpower really exists.

80
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,910
It is possible to read someone else's memory...

81
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:24,220
even if they're wearing thin clothes.

82
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,519
But it's best if I can touch their skin.

83
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,819
It is believed that he got this superpower when he developed...

84
00:07:27,819 --> 00:07:30,149
- his secondary sex characteristics. - Their memory is delivered to me.

85
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:33,290
I believe he's reading the electromagnetic information...

86
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:34,759
- inside their synapse. - It's like being in a library.

87
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:37,329
I browse through their aligned memories.

88
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,199
Then I open them up.

89
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,870
I guess we can call it a superpower...

90
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,069
- until science can explain it. - I promise you...

91
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:47,339
that I won't use this superpower for certain countries...

92
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,769
even if it's my own country.

Mr. Dong Baek has been appointed as an assistant inspector.

95
00:07:58,949 --> 00:08:02,290
Everyone wondered which line of work he'd choose.

96
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,660
Two months after his appointment,

97

98
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,089
26 unsolved cases from the past.

99
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:13,870
Even the Supreme Court is in awe of his superpower.

100
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,730
- He has aided the police. - Will you be able to read...

101
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,399
- my memory the moment we touch? - Not at all.

102
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:21,339
I need to focus.

103
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:25,209
- Then it's okay to shake hands. - Yes.

104
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:27,850
But I doubt there are many people who'd want to.

105
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:32,149
Three years ago, many people were shocked...

106
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,750
when you chose your profession.

107
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,590
Why did you choose to work for the police?

108
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:40,419
Being a civil servant means you wouldn't be able...

109
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,429
to receive funds from all the foundations worldwide.

110
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,669
I had already received plenty of funds.

111
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:50,000
I didn't feel the need for more money.

112
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,769
But most of all,

113
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,110
I had a personal reason for that.

114
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,889
Open ridges among the rice paddies.

115

One hand on the left side of the chest.

119
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,019
They planned beforehand where to throw away the body.

Murder weapon.

121
00:09:50,029 --> 00:09:51,629
It's not an iron ax.

122
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,730
They have identical signatures and MO.

123
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,600
They were intentional.

Choi Poong Won, the head of Gongryong Gang...

129
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:44,149
was arrested right before...

130
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:46,220
the expiration of his statute of limitations.

131
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,289
The people found out that Det. Dong was involved...

132
00:10:50,419 --> 00:10:53,159
and have gathered in front of the station.

133
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,090
The National Police Agency...

134
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,629
repeatedly announced that they couldn't confirm...

135
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:59,059
whether the detective was involved or not.

136
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:02,330
- They're only claiming that... - They refuse to share information.

137
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,870
Det. Dong is only involved in other cases.

138
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:08,009
Many people have gathered to see Det. Dong...

139
00:11:08,309 --> 00:11:10,740
and are causing a riot in front of the station.

140
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,440
Excuse me.

141
00:11:14,009 --> 00:11:15,450
Passing through.

142
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,049
Excuse me.

143
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,120
Passing through.

144
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,590
I'm sorry, but you may not enter.

145
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,850
We received permission.

146
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,419
You did?

147
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,730
- They're with me. - I see.

148
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,889
Thank you.

149
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:31,730
It's a mess.

150
00:11:32,299 --> 00:11:33,500
It'll get worse.

151
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,370
Foreigners think this is some sort of a tourist site.

Will the interview take place at the Special Detective Support Team?

153
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:43,039
Yes. Today's highlight is revealing Det. Dong's workplace.

154
00:11:43,309 --> 00:11:46,210
- It was hidden quite well. - Exactly.

155
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,350
It wasn't easy to receive permission.

156
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:49,750
This way.

157
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,490
All right, this is the Communications Team.

158
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,320
They talk with the media and manage overseas schedules.

159
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:01,629
These conscripted officers separate the fan letters...

160
00:12:01,629 --> 00:12:02,759
from the civil affairs.

161
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:04,159
Are those a week's worth?

162
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,730
- No, these are a day's worth. - What?

163
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,070
Do you usually get that much?

164
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,299
We didn't get much today.

165
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:15,370
Shall we move to the main office?

166
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:23,279
You work at the same office, right?

167
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,750
Of course. I'm his partner.

168
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,120
- Are you always together? - Of course.

169
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,590
We're Batman and Robin.

170
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,090
That's amazing.

171
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,659
Right?

172
00:12:32,789 --> 00:12:34,860
You get to see him every day.

173
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,330
You're a fan, aren't you?

174
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:42,100
It's related to my work, so I'm interested.

175
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,740
But he does have a certain image that I like.

176
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,269
What's that?

177
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,070
He seems like...

178
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,539
a cutting-edge SF character.

179
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,149
- Shall we go this way? - Sure.

180
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,230
I thought you were interviewing Dong Baek.

181
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,330
What?

182
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,960
We were going to do it here.

183
00:13:13,429 --> 00:13:15,399
He was getting ready in the weight room.

184
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:17,299
He seemed very excited about the interview.

185
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,840
Bring him.

186
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,600
What a surprise.

187
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,669
He wasn't even interested in other interviews.

188
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:26,039
If you wait here,

189
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:27,440
I'll be back soon.

190
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:32,220
Where is Dong Baek?

191
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,120
Here, my son-in-law.

192
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,320
Thank you, Mother.

193
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,460
Goodness.

194
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,490
By the way, when will you meet my daughter?

195
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,360
I'm telling you. She's really pretty.

196
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:46,299
I bet she is since you're beautiful.

197
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:47,870
She is pretty.

198
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,529
You only say those things.

199
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,799
Is it because you have high standards?

200
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,570
I'm fine as long as they're not criminals.

201
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,080
Goodness!

202
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,379
Of course, she isn't.

203
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:03,879
She's preparing to become a level seven civil servant.

204
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:06,379
- Are you coming? - I am.

205
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,789
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

206
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,889
Then I'm going to set a date.

207
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,629
What's the point if he's a detective?

208
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:16,490
What do you mean?

209
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,860
They'll have problems under the sheets.

210
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:22,029
Why? Does he have issues down there?

211
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,600
Who'll be able to handle him?

212
00:14:25,799 --> 00:14:30,169
He'll read their memory if they touch.

213
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,009
So what? It's good to be honest.

214
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,710
Did you ever shake his hand?

215
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,149
No.

216
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:40,620
But I'm sure he and his colleagues are close enough.

217
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:45,820
There are 500 people here, but only 2 are close with him.

218
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,490
And they have to be...

219
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,789
because they need to stop him from causing trouble.

220
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:52,960
Everyone has secrets.

221
00:14:53,159 --> 00:14:57,299
How will anyone be able to date a guy who can see through them?

222
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,110
My daughter is kind, so she'll be fine.

223
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,370
Goodness.

224
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:05,279
Don't even joke about that...

225
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,110
if you don't want to ruin her future.

226
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,419
Goodness.

227
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:16,620
(Dong Baek)

228
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,659
Baek! Baek!

229
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,559
It's on the news.

230
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,129
That's nothing new.

231
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:26,600
No, that's not what I mean.

232
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,330
- I can't believe they filmed it. - Look, look.

233
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,470
Reporter Kim, where is that?

234
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,470
This was in Bookyung.

235
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,009
An anonymous civilian sent the video.

236
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,879
He wasn't promoted. He was degraded.

237
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,450
He had beaten up all the suspects.

238
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,620
He had many special abilities,

239
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:46,919
but he was merely a constable.

240
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:49,220
There were countless rumors...

241
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:52,289
- about his assault. - What is this?

242
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,990
That's not it.

243
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:56,159
- Look at this. - They had covered up his assault...

244
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,799
due to his superpower.

245
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:01,629
However, please keep in mind that we haven't verified...

246
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,799
this information yet.

247
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:06,039
But the victim is a criminal who's at large.

248
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,710
Will he receive an extenuation?

249
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,509
There's something else that our human rights group...

250
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:10,509
is concerned about.

251
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:13,139
It's his ability to read other people's memories.

252
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,779
He secretly reads them to catch the criminals.

253
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:19,379
This is a graver crime than wiretapping.

254
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:24,690
How many times has it been?

255
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,220
Sir?

256
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,090
Your visit to the disciplinary committee.

257
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,929
- Four times, sir. - Count the unofficial ones as well.

258
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,299
Then it's been about eight times.

259
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:41,039
Being a detective is a hobby for him, right?

260
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,940
Not at all, sir. This is my calling...

261
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,309
Then how could you commit assault eight times?

262
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,049
But one of those was just...

263
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,409
You lunatic.

264
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,320
Don't you know that the media is breathing down your neck?

265
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,850
You must've thought that your superpower...

266
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:57,090
would make up for your recklessness.

267
00:16:57,090 --> 00:17:00,190
But you're done for now. It's the end.

268
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:03,159
Who is it? We're carrying out an evaluation here!

269
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:19,910
Have you eaten?

270
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:21,849
Yes, I had a Korean-style meal.

271
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,579
What's the result?

272
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:26,750
We're thinking about suspending him...

273
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:27,950
for roughly six months.

274
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,089
- Dong Baek. - Constable Dong Baek.

275
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:37,089
Take a break for two months or so.

276
00:17:38,059 --> 00:17:40,359
- This time, I truly feel wronged... - Your task...

277
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,599
was to share information, correct?

278
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:47,140
- Yes, sir. - So why did you go...

279
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,309
to the scene and assault a man?

280
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:51,509
Had I not been there, we wouldn't have been able to arrest him.

281
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:52,740
The prosecution will bring charges against you.

282
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,410
What? "Charges"?

283
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,650
You do know...

284
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,450
that a fine of 3,000 dollars or more will mean you'll get fired.

285
00:18:01,349 --> 00:18:03,490
I really need this job.

286
00:18:11,859 --> 00:18:13,599
Still, we should help him claim innocence.

287
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,039
We're family, after all.

288
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,779
Yes, sir.

289
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:32,349
You may go.

290
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,240
(The National Police Agency Is Warmhearted and Trustworthy)

291
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,339
How did it go?

292
00:18:58,779 --> 00:19:01,349
- Tell me. - Do you have a gun?

293
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,180
No. Why?

294
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,380
Shoot me.

295
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:06,920
What do you mean?

296
00:19:07,019 --> 00:19:08,819
Let me die on duty.

297
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,289
Did you get sacked?

298
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,220
No way.

299
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:17,029
Come on, tell me.

300
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,400
I'm suspended for two months.

301
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,569
That's not bad at all.

302
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,740
See? They can't sack you.

303
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,000
They won't be able to withstand the criticism.

304
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,609
- Are you crying? - No.

305
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,180
- You are. - There's something...

306
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,250
on my contact lens.

307
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:42,190
You don't even wear any.

308
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:44,089
Why would the mighty detective with a superpower cry?

309
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,759
You've received punishment before.

310
00:19:45,819 --> 00:19:47,490
The prosecution is going to bring charges against me!

311
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,059
Seriously?

312
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,900
What has happened to this country?

313
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,599
I think it's broken.

314
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,039
- Let's take the stairs. - Okay.

315
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:03,240
Gosh.

316
00:20:06,839 --> 00:20:08,480
(Murder of Two College Girls, Jung Soo Yeon, Han Da Rim)

317
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:10,250
They were both 20 years old.

318
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:13,150
They were found a week apart and 100km away from each other.

319
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:16,250
- They were both sexually assaulted. - Proof of the serial killing?

320
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,720
They both went missing on Tuesday and were found...

321
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,259
- a week later... - What if it's just a coincidence?

322
00:20:21,789 --> 00:20:24,059
Their skulls were both crushed.

323
00:20:24,289 --> 00:20:25,359
What else?

324
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,569
I believe they were tied up...

325
00:20:28,569 --> 00:20:31,500
and attacked with a 4cm diameter object...

326
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,200
several times.

327
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,740
So he's one of a kind.

328
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:38,779
The stations in those regions are looking into this.

329
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,779
We must bring these cases here...

330
00:20:39,779 --> 00:20:40,980
and create our own investigation team.

331
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:42,910
And you want to be in charge?

332
00:20:44,049 --> 00:20:45,119
Yes, sir.

333
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:48,750
Set up a Regional Investigation Unit...

334
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:50,390
in Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

335
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:52,960
Thank you, sir.

336
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:56,559
Make sure to be discreet.

337
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,829
- Yes, sir. I won't let the media... - No, no.

338
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,029
Make sure Mr. Superpower doesn't know.

339
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,470
Do you mean Det. Dong Baek?

340
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,839
Is there anyone else?

341
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,380
I'll keep that in mind, sir.

342
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:22,019
When did you become a senior superintendent?

343
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,420
At the age of 30, sir. It was last year.

344
00:21:25,089 --> 00:21:28,190
Right. You made a new record by achieving it two years earlier.

345
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:32,900
A senior superintendent is one of the highest managers.

346
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,269
Look at the other superintendents.

347
00:21:35,329 --> 00:21:37,400
They manage 400 to 500 people.

348

Only the small fry is passionate enough...

349
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,539
to catch criminals.

Me? I'm almost there.

Don't worry. No one will kidnap me.

355
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,470
Don't come out. It's cold.

356
00:22:51,539 --> 00:22:52,740
Bye.

357
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,119
Please help me!

Please!

359
00:23:54,339 --> 00:23:56,240

I want to live in peace!

(Seobu Police Station)

368
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,190
I think he'll get fired this time.

369
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,690
The press is going crazy.

370
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,660
If the Chief Justice takes this case...

371
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,259
He'll get probation at the minimum. I bet he'll be expelled.

372
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,099
My goodness.

373
00:24:59,769 --> 00:25:00,769
Hey.

374
00:25:00,769 --> 00:25:01,940
Aren't we on the same team?

Hey! Know your place if you're the youngest.

Don't you get it?

377
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,880
Dong Baek loves his job.

378
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,250
Hey, we never told him to beat someone up.

379
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:15,349
You picked up his temper after going around with him.

381
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:19,690

Why are you crying? So many people want you.

385

You won't die even if you stop investigating.

386

Don't cry. It's embarrassing.

387
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,490
A man should only cry when he's dying.

388

His 10-year-old daughter sent me a letter.

398

She has only seen her dad lying down.

399
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,430
She whispered in his ear...

400
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,430
to tell him we caught the bad guy.

401

What a joke.

I'm grateful for being on the waitlist.

404
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:51,509
Until now, I only replied by sending my autographs.

405
00:26:51,509 --> 00:26:53,079
I should reply to every letter.

406

Sure, enjoy it all you want.

407

Where are you, Det. Dong Baek?

408
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:10,400
Detective, my daughter disappeared.

409
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:12,599
- Please save her. - What's the matter?

410
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,700
Her daughter disappeared near their home.

411
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:17,740
She got off the bus.

Our house is less than 10 minutes away,

413

but she didn't come home all night.

414
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,309
Was it reported?

415
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,480
It's been reported to the station which has the jurisdiction,

416
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,079
but it hasn't been 24 hours yet.

417

If it's an emergency abduction, they can investigate right away.

am...

If I get on the bad side of those higher up,

430

00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,910
I'll help you up.

438

Please calm down and follow me.

439
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:31,819
I'll die.

- Get in. - You don't know where I'm going.

I'll do the questioning, so just follow me around.

What kind of person do you think your partner is?

I have a better face now...

What are you trying to do?

485
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:32,759
Did he stop going to horse races?

486
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,799
- Pardon? - I bet he does.

487

because he went missing instead of staking out.

He was putting bets on horses.

492

Thanks to him, an innocent citizen was hurt.

You hit me first, so I won't give you any settlement money.

497

Just step back.

498

Okay. Without any settlement money.

499
00:32:07,529 --> 00:32:08,970
Let's fight. Okay?

500
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,369
Okay.

501
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,579
(On Official Duty)

502
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,349
You practiced.

503
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,019
Bring it on.

504
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:42,170
Stop that.

505
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,069
Calm down.

506
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:51,640
I'm busy.

507
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,380
Hey! Dong Baek!

508
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,480
You saw that, right? Did you see it?

509
00:32:56,609 --> 00:32:58,309
- Yes. - Go! Go!

510
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:02,220
Hurry up and go.

511
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,690
Why did you...

512
00:33:05,049 --> 00:33:07,119
make a fuss when you're no game?

513
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,460
Hurry to Sangrim University Hospital.

514
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,529
(Sangrim University Hospital)

515
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:11,029
Why? To get a doctor's note?

516
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,430
Hurry!

517
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,329
Aren't we going to investigate the neighborhood?

518
00:33:14,329 --> 00:33:16,400
- I already did. - When?

519
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,970
Both victims went missing on Tuesday.

520
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,410
I don't think this is a simple missing case.

521
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,640
Their corpses were found a week later, through the same pattern.

522
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:29,150
The special investigation headquarters is now official.

523
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:31,480
They came because it's a serial abduction case.

524
00:33:32,319 --> 00:33:33,380
What?

525
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,750
Hey.

526
00:33:35,619 --> 00:33:38,319
The third victim lost consciousness but is still alive.

527
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:40,220
They found the third victim this morning.

528
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,990
She was still breathing.

529
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:49,369
Is that why we're going to Sangrim University Hospital?

530
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:51,670
I got it.

531
00:34:24,369 --> 00:34:25,800
Mom...

532
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,119
I didn't see your face.

533
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,159
I won't report it to the police, so please let me go.

534
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:52,730
For all of you listening to the words of truth right now,

535
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:55,599
I hope you will get boundless good fortune.

536
00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:58,599
- I promise. I won't report it. - Now, let us...

537
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:01,070
open the first grand chapter...

538
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,340
to study the words of truth.

539
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:07,679
Those of you who are starting to study these words...

540
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:08,949
must have gone through many difficulties...

541
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:11,750
- I won't say anything. - in your lives.

542
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,820
Perhaps you might be...

543
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,889
in an unexpected hardship even at this moment.

544
00:35:17,889 --> 00:35:21,789
You might even be startled or sad.

545
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:26,500
However, this is where we must ask.

546
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:31,570
Why do humans fall into suffering?

547
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:36,539
If we lived without suffering and only in happiness...

548
00:35:36,539 --> 00:35:38,210
before death...

549
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,909
(Sangrim University Hospital)

550
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:48,889
There's no way in.

551
00:35:49,219 --> 00:35:50,449
Let's go for today.

552
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:55,760
You could really get expelled if they find this as a fault.

553
00:35:58,730 --> 00:35:59,929
Yoon Ye Rim.

554
00:36:01,199 --> 00:36:02,329
25 years old.

555
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:06,440
I can feel it when I read memories.

556
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:10,840
The mother's thoughts,

557
00:36:13,039 --> 00:36:14,510
and her fear of losing her daughter.

558
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,510
I can't just sit and watch.

559
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,150
There's no way for us to get in. They have so much security.

560
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,889
Then we'll have to find a way.

561
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,289
Find what?

562
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,260
Aren't you on the waitlist?

563
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,989
Come here. You...

564
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:33,030
Come here, come here.

565
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:35,429
You're the troublemaker. Why are you scolding him?

566
00:36:38,130 --> 00:36:40,840
What is this? Did you put him up to this?

567
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,510
Did you only get it now? I already know you inside and out.

568
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:45,880
Why didn't you tell me?

569
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,949
It'd be nicer if the three of us worked together from the start.

570
00:36:48,949 --> 00:36:50,949
Come here, come here. What's wrong with you?

571
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,550
It really hurts.

572
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,949
Good job, everyone.

573
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:58,719
- Any problems? - Captain Koo.

574
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,159
- Did anything stand out? - Hey...

575
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:07,230
You must be very busy.

576
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,699
- Are you well? - Yes.

577
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,969
Darn it.

578
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,019
It's your first time meeting him, right?

579
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:32,219
He was appointed after you got fired from the RIU.

580
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,719
This is Chief Byun Young Soo.

581
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:36,190
Why does he keep on saying I'm fired? I quit.

582
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,789
We'll be responsible if any problems occur.

583
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:11,489
Yoon Ye Rim's missing case...

584
00:38:12,429 --> 00:38:13,659
isn't related to the serial murder case.

585
00:38:13,659 --> 00:38:14,960
If I can just check...

586
00:38:16,099 --> 00:38:18,199
Actually, she's the daughter...

587
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,599
of one of our colleagues at the station.

588
00:38:19,769 --> 00:38:21,699
Even if they're not related,

589
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:24,510
Dong Baek might be helpful with catching the serial killer...

590
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,679
I'm the one in charge of this case.

591
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,510
Of course. Of course you are.

592
00:38:27,809 --> 00:38:29,349
That's why I'm asking for a favor since we have a history...

593
00:38:29,349 --> 00:38:30,909
I'll be the one responsible.

594
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:35,019
Because I'm the one approving it.

595
00:38:35,449 --> 00:38:36,989
Thank you.

596
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,070
Didn't you say this isn't the investigation headquarters?

597
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,469
- Why won't you let us in? - Let us confirm it.

598
00:38:50,469 --> 00:38:52,369
- Let us talk... - I'm sorry.

599
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:53,400
Are you in charge of the case?

600
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,110
Were you offered to become a professor at Police Academy?

601
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,239
Wait!

602
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:59,210
We want to know.

603
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,940
Why are you asking us?

604
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,650
Okay.

605
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,690
Put it up on the screen.

606
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:20,230
What are you doing? We confirmed the victim three hours ago already.

607
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:23,269
(Personal Record)

608
00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:25,329
Kim Seo Kyeong. She's a student majoring in theater.

609
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:27,300
- She used to be a child actress. - Next.

610
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:30,570
Her phone was turned off two weeks ago, but no one reported it...

611
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,369
- because she lives alone. - Her line of movement?

612
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:33,880
I already have it ready.

613
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,349
She was last seen taking the bus towards the church...

614
00:39:37,349 --> 00:39:38,780
on Tuesday two weeks ago.

615
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,519
- What about inside the bus? - The field team went to get it.

616
00:40:19,219 --> 00:40:20,320
Can't you see anything?

617
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,090
It's hard to read when they're unconscious.

618
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:25,059
She's in a vegetable state on top of that.

619
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,199
I'll try again.

620
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:55,059
It broke.

621
00:41:04,469 --> 00:41:05,800
Things shattered...

622
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,110
and got tangled up.

623
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:18,449
- Another victim! - What?

624
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,789
Let go!

625
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,860
Let go!

626
00:42:03,989 --> 00:42:05,090
Let go!

627
00:42:08,829 --> 00:42:10,130
Let go!

628
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:22,610
Dong Baek! Dong Baek!

629
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:23,780
Dong Baek!

630
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:31,420
This is the footage from the bus.

631
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,289
This neighborhood is remote, so there are no security cameras.

632
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,460
Stop. Show me the bus stop one more time.

633
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,300
Show me the footage of the bus at the same time.

634
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,610
Zoom in on her phone.

635
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:58,679
It's different.

636
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:00,780
It's a different phone model.

637
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:08,820
They're from the same brand,

638
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,860
but the rear camera is slightly different.

639
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,659
She has two phones.

640
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,730
Find the number of the second phone.

641
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:22,269
We'll track the numbers that moved with the bus.

642
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:32,610
Mom.

643
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,050
Mom.

644
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:38,690
Mom.

645
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:42,960
Mom.

646
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:03,650
Hey.

647
00:44:03,949 --> 00:44:05,050
Are you okay?

648
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:07,820
There's another abducted victim.

649
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:09,550
- Who? - Where?

650
00:44:09,949 --> 00:44:11,190
I must tell the RIU.

651
00:44:11,489 --> 00:44:12,690
They all left.

652
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,119
- What? - It's a serial murder case, right?

653
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:17,630
- We'll hold an official briefing. - What do you mean?

654
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:18,690
Chief Byun Young Soo!

655
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:22,599
Sir, two deaths and one injury. Am I correct?

656
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:23,869
Until when were you intending on hiding it?

657
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,369
- Are there more missing people? - Please quiet down.

658
00:44:26,199 --> 00:44:28,369
I will issue an embargo until there's a further notice.

659
00:44:29,769 --> 00:44:31,969
How could you decide that unilaterally without discussing...

660
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:34,809
There's a high possibility that another kidnapped victim exists.

661
00:44:35,179 --> 00:44:37,550
If this is mentioned on the news, that victim will die.

662
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,980
That's how brutal criminals react.

663
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:41,079
- Please tell us some details... - The briefing...

664
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:42,619
will be held in the auditorium as planned. Thank you.

665
00:44:42,619 --> 00:44:43,889
Wait, please give us more details!

666
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:47,690
I found her phone signal.

667
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:54,329
The victim's second phone...

668
00:44:54,659 --> 00:44:56,070
was turned off right after being kidnapped...

669
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:57,500
and turned back on a week later.

670
00:44:57,929 --> 00:45:00,369
Her location has changed, but she hasn't called anyone.

671
00:45:00,469 --> 00:45:02,599
There's a 90 percent possibility it's the perp.

672
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,739
Her current location is Onha-ri 6-gil.

673
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:08,280
All teams within a 10km radius will be mobilized immediately.

674
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:11,079
However, surround the area and wait until the SWAT team arrives.

675
00:45:11,079 --> 00:45:12,179
That will be all.

676
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:26,659
Chief Byun. Det. Dong Baek says he has something to tell you.

677
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,800
Make sure Mr. Superpower doesn't know.

678
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:30,929
Chief Byun.

679
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,440
If it's about the investigation, I need to know too.

680
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:43,280
(Det. Dong Baek)

681
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:44,679
- What is it? - There's...

682
00:45:44,679 --> 00:45:46,519
another kidnapped victim. A young girl.

683
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:47,750
Besides Yoon Ye Rim?

684
00:45:47,849 --> 00:45:49,849
She was in a basement, and I saw two more things.

685
00:45:50,389 --> 00:45:52,420
First, a red pig.

686
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,019
- Red pig? - And the other thing was...

687
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:56,559
a small hammer that you can hold in one hand, like a claw hammer.

688
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,730
- A claw hammer? - The perp was holding it.

689
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,099
Is that it?

690
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:01,199
If we combine these two clues,

691
00:46:01,199 --> 00:46:02,429
I'm sure we can find out where the perp...

692
00:46:02,429 --> 00:46:04,530
- We already found out. - What?

693
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:06,539
- Where is it? - Thanks for the tip.

694
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,079
You fainted. Where do you think you're going?

695
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,780
A special medical team is coming.

696
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:24,250
- The RIU. - They won't even let you in.

697
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:25,489
Come on, don't bother.

698
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:28,119
I think it's the same perp.

699
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,530
- What? - Did you see something?

700
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:30,889
It's just a hunch.

701
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:33,400
What? Are you some shaman now with superpowers?

702
00:46:58,219 --> 00:46:59,690
It's the perp! Catch him!

703
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:51,110
He got away?

704
00:48:00,820 --> 00:48:01,880
Random memory scanning?

705
00:48:02,219 --> 00:48:03,349
No, don't do it.

706
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,550
You'll really go to jail for that.

707
00:48:07,019 --> 00:48:08,559
Hey. Dong Baek.

708
00:48:10,789 --> 00:48:11,860
Dong Baek!

709
00:48:15,159 --> 00:48:16,269
Darn.

710
00:48:54,039 --> 00:48:55,170
Here!

711
00:48:58,210 --> 00:48:59,340
Dong Baek!

712
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:01,809
Oh, gosh.

713
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,309
- Dong Baek! - Taxi!

714
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:06,380
That taxi!

715
00:49:12,019 --> 00:49:13,159
What the...

716
00:49:14,389 --> 00:49:15,420
Darn it!

717
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:17,760
- Wait. - Hey!

718
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:21,800
You're under arrest for kidnapping and injuring Kim Seo Kyeong.

719
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,599
You have the right to consult an attorney...

720
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:26,440
and to file an appeal against a wrongful arrest.

721
00:49:26,739 --> 00:49:28,739
You may also refuse to give any unfavorable statements.

722
00:49:28,739 --> 00:49:30,210
But all of that will be useless.

723
00:49:30,210 --> 00:49:31,340
Let go!

724
00:49:35,909 --> 00:49:37,079
Stay still.

725
00:49:39,550 --> 00:49:40,650
Is it him?

726
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,420
You darned...

727
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,389
Hey, don't beat him up.

728
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,590
- It's not him. - What?

729
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:52,429
Didn't you chase him after reading his memory?

730
00:49:52,590 --> 00:49:55,199
I saw Kim Seo Kyeong's assaulted face, but it was long ago.

731
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:56,570
What?

732
00:49:56,900 --> 00:49:59,630
He got dumped and stalked her, and even hit her six months ago.

733
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,869
- Then... - He was released yesterday.

734
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:06,139
- From prison. - Why did you run away then?

735
00:50:06,380 --> 00:50:08,139
- You scumbags. - Shut your mouth.

736
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:09,880
You're just like dogs.

737
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,179
Dogs who only protect the rich and powerful.

738
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:14,519
Dogs!

739
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:16,949
Another nutjob?

740
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,219
Do you know how nice Seo Kyeong was?

741
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:20,889
Is that why you beat her up like that?

742
00:50:21,590 --> 00:50:23,789
Headquarters. Requesting for a background check.

743
00:50:23,929 --> 00:50:26,829
- 930712... - You made Seo Kyeong like that.

744
00:50:27,099 --> 00:50:28,730
The reason she was caught by those evil jerks...

745
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:31,030
was because of parasites like you.

746
00:50:31,329 --> 00:50:33,000
Just like that dirty hammer!

747
00:50:37,269 --> 00:50:38,840
I should go meet a shaman or something.

748
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,309
Why do I always get involved with these lunatics?

749
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:42,380
What did you just say?

750
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,780
Wait, Dong Baek. Calm down.

751
00:50:44,949 --> 00:50:46,309
What was that last word?

752
00:50:47,019 --> 00:50:48,250
You still have a sense of pride?

753
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,619
When you're merely a dog controlled by power?

754
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:50,750
What did you just say about a hammer?

755
00:51:26,690 --> 00:51:27,960
Why did the Lord...

756
00:51:28,860 --> 00:51:31,690
who has created this beautiful universe...

757
00:51:32,289 --> 00:51:35,599
- also create pain and hardships... - You can't fail the test.

758
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:38,929
to make human beings suffer so much?

759
00:51:40,539 --> 00:51:42,500
- Was the Lord heartless? - Here.

760
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:45,340
- Here. - Or was He reckless?

761
00:51:46,170 --> 00:51:49,909
Maybe, the Lord's pure intent was to...

762
00:51:49,909 --> 00:51:51,010
Who are you?

763
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:53,480
- Where are we? - If you fail the doctrine test,

764
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:55,750
you'll die.

765
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:58,619
In order to find that answer...

766
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:00,690
The girl who was brought here before died like that.

767
00:52:00,989 --> 00:52:04,059
But before we ask for the answer...

768
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:05,559
What do I do then?

769
00:52:06,730 --> 00:52:08,429
You need a score of 90 to pass.

770
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,699
You must receive 90 at least.

771
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,139
Who on earth is he?

772
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:18,809
In conclusion,

773
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:22,340
the moment all human beings with souls...

774
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:26,050
are born into this world, they are naturally...

775
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,250
(Pass the doctrine test and live forever, or fail and die.)

776
00:52:29,250 --> 00:52:30,389
asked this question.

777
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:35,989
Although this question seems perfectly normal,

778
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,389
fundamentally, it's totally different.

779
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:41,559
People believe...

780
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:45,800
these problems arise from the conflict between good and evil.

781
00:52:46,199 --> 00:52:49,269
Actually, all human relationships...

782
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:53,440
are based on these symbolic original sins.

783
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:29,380
- Move! - Go!

784
00:53:33,010 --> 00:53:34,420
We just lost the signal.

785
00:53:34,780 --> 00:53:35,880
Report your situation.

786
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:37,750
- We have a signal. - What's the situation?

787
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,320
Field team. Report your situation.

788
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,260
Field team. We hear you.

789
00:53:50,869 --> 00:53:51,869
Darn.

790
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:03,809
What is this?

791
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:10,590
They're high school students.

792
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:12,650
They said they picked up the cellphone on the street.

793
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:21,800
Chief Byun. The embargo has been breached.

794
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:23,300
What?

795
00:54:27,469 --> 00:54:29,099
How can I broadcast the news during an embargo?

796
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,369
Two internet media companies have already broadcasted it!

797
00:54:31,409 --> 00:54:33,039
We're members of the press corps.

798
00:54:33,039 --> 00:54:34,940
The lives of the victims are on our hands!

799
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:35,940
Do you actually believe that?

800
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:38,349
The cops don't even know who's been kidnapped.

801
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:40,019
What if it's true?

802
00:54:40,019 --> 00:54:42,880
Once someone makes the first move, everything will collapse.

803
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,789
Stuff like an embargo won't matter!

804
00:54:44,789 --> 00:54:46,789
Still, we should consider our relationship with other...

805
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,309
There were traces of their hands and feet being tied...

806
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:15,150
- and being hit several times... - My gosh.

807
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:17,489
with a weapon on their face, leading to severe injuries.

808
00:55:17,690 --> 00:55:20,059
Also, they were abandoned in the metropolitan area...

809
00:55:20,059 --> 00:55:22,219
that had no connections with the victims whatsoever.

810
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:42,110
Detective Superpower?

811
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:47,719
I've had a long day.

812
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:50,590
Oh, my.

813
00:55:52,719 --> 00:55:54,320
It's an honor to meet such a famous man like you.

814
00:56:04,869 --> 00:56:05,900
(Hammer Management)

815
00:56:06,329 --> 00:56:07,500
Hammer Management?

816
00:56:08,739 --> 00:56:09,769
Do you know me?

817
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:11,110
Of course.

818
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:13,409
It's been a while since I've worked in the field.

819
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:15,239
You were forced to retire and became a pimp.

820
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:17,679
A pimp who deceives trainees and makes them do prostitution.

821
00:56:18,849 --> 00:56:20,380
Just like that poor Seo Kyeong.

822
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:22,579
What are you talking about?

823
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:26,250
You know Seo Kyeong's ex-boyfriend, right?

824
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:28,960
- Who? - You know, the guy...

825
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,590
who stalked her and found out her boss was a trashy pimp.

826
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:36,000
Wait a minute, it says on my card that I'm a manager...

827
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,769
But there was something he didn't know.

828
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,300
If he found out, I'm sure he would've killed you.

829
00:56:42,199 --> 00:56:43,269
And what is that?

830
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,019
Rape and blackmail.

831
00:56:57,519 --> 00:56:59,389
A thug with a hammer tattoo.

832
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,489
That's interesting. Although it lacks any grounds.

833
00:57:05,989 --> 00:57:07,329
Let's keep it simple.

834
00:57:07,630 --> 00:57:11,170
I'm chasing a murderer right now. And I need to read your memory.

835
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:15,300
We were dating. Seo Kyeong was the one who took her clothes off.

836
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,739
Why do you think she still works with me then?

837
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:24,010
Did you ever...

838
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:27,079
kill a woman 20 years ago?

839
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,820
What is this nonsense about 20 years ago?

840
00:57:30,389 --> 00:57:32,090
I can't even remember who I hit yesterday.

841
00:57:35,489 --> 00:57:36,889
I heard you were a weirdo.

842
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:45,769
Whenever I see thugs, my urge to beat them up drives me crazy.

843
00:57:47,039 --> 00:57:49,199
I heard if you hit someone again, you'll go to jail.

844
00:57:49,769 --> 00:57:50,809
Will that be okay?

845
00:57:53,539 --> 00:57:55,139
Here. Right here.

846
00:57:55,639 --> 00:57:57,650
Detective Superpower is here.

847
00:57:57,650 --> 00:57:58,880
Right here, everyone.

848
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:01,079
He's Detective Superpower.

849
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:02,579
Gather around.

850
00:58:02,579 --> 00:58:04,650
- It's him. - He's so handsome!

851
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:07,460
- Take a picture! - He has superpowers.

852
00:58:10,159 --> 00:58:11,690
Look how good-looking he is!

853
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:13,960
- Well, well. - My gosh!

854
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:19,170
Was he not aware of the foolish betrayal of humans?

855
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:21,699
This leads to a logical contradiction.

856
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:24,269
So was the Lord incompetent...

857
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:27,010
or really heartless like we thought?

858
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:30,280
Almost all religions in the world...

859
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:33,210
made the mistake of literally translating...

860
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:36,920
the symbolic teachings of these types of prophets.

861
00:58:37,789 --> 00:58:40,960
As a result, this leads to...

862
00:58:41,659 --> 00:58:44,559
people being mistaken about...

863
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:49,260
If...

864
00:58:50,369 --> 00:58:52,300
I didn't kill anyone, what will you do?

865
00:58:54,599 --> 00:58:55,699
Apologize?

866
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:58,769
I'll let you off for urinating in public.

867
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:27,599
Get rid of her!

868
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:34,239
(Special thanks to Ha Do Gwon, Park Jin Woo,)

869
00:59:34,239 --> 00:59:35,739
(Kim Gi Du, and Choi Hee.)

870
00:59:48,289 --> 00:59:51,489
(Memorist)

871
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:52,829
He kills someone every Tuesday.

872
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:54,159
It's tomorrow.

873
00:59:54,659 --> 00:59:56,599
- It'll be Tuesday in four hours. - Stop!

874
00:59:56,860 --> 00:59:58,530
- I said, stop! - Dispatch all your men...

875
00:59:58,530 --> 01:00:00,030
to search Onha-ri.

876
01:00:00,030 --> 01:00:01,340
You'll search all 80 places...

877
01:00:01,340 --> 01:00:03,099
including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court's villa?

878
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:04,239
I'll take responsibility.

879
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:06,309
Do you think this will end with you losing your job?

880
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,110
Where are you?

881
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:09,679
I need to drop by somewhere.

882
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:11,309
There's another target.

883
01:00:11,579 --> 01:00:13,719
Number 13. She was called "Customer number 13".

884
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:17,050
I'll expose who that Number 13 is from now on.

885
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:19,349
Okay. It's a deal.
