and psychiatrist.

- Well...

She sent a parcel to a friend
just before she died.

I don't care
if it's an adult or a kid.

I knew you weren't sane,
but I didn't expect this.

42
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,129
You played here often...

43
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:48,930
when you were little.

44
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,439
You were really cute.

45
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:55,669
Cut that nonsense.

46
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,310
But then again,
your last memory of this place...

47
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,509
was pretty horrendous.

- No way. How did you know?

- Mom, Ju Ran is so amazing.
- What?

She can read what I'm thinking.

66
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:24,819
I never told her that I wanted
to become a police officer.

All right. I get it.

100

Leave it and go.

00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,039
Hurry.

102
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,350
Something bad happened,

103
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:08,919
right?

104
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,960
If it's too much to bear,
should I erase it?

105

- If it's something bad, then...
- Ju Ran.

106

Erasing my memory...

107
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:30,340
doesn't mean it didn't happen.

108

That was when I had realized...

109

He committed suicide.

Do you remember
where you hung out with the boys?

118
00:10:24,899 --> 00:10:26,629
I wonder if he saw something there.

119
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:29,129
Your father would be so upset
if he finds out. Don't you agree?

120
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,500
Yoo Ah Yeong committed suicide.

121

Cover it up well.

122
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,710
Nobody should suspect her
of being sexually assaulted.

- Don't worry about that.
- What about Moon Yong Dae?

124

We're keeping an eye on him.

125
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,330
Through my ability, I was able
to know whom I should eliminate.

126
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,360
That's why you killed them?
It was for your revenge?

127

"Revenge"?

128

That's not what this is.

129
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,600
I'm just doing what should be done
with this ability of mine.

130
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:11,740
If I must say,
I guess it's for justice.

131
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:15,649
And the fruit of that justice
is insanity?

132
00:11:16,179 --> 00:11:18,379
Justice comes with pain.

133
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:20,320
You know that.

134
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,649
Whenever you use your ability
to do what's right,

135
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:25,159
you end up hurting yourself.

137
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,629
He had nothing to do with this.

138
00:11:34,029 --> 00:11:36,899
As the Executioner, he was already
doing what was right.

139

In order to protect his daughter
from Hwang Pil Sun,

140

he kept a record
of Bang Jun Seok's evil deeds.

141

There were more than enough reasons
for us to join hands.

And there was a reason
for the pain he felt.

Hi, Ju Ran.

144
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:04,659
Just like the pain you and I
suffered and still suffer from.

- He's studying abroad.

That's a pity.

160

You said this would be fun.

Mom, Ju Ran isn't here.

167
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11,320
Really? She never tells me
where she's going these days.

168
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,720
Ju Ho, close the door.

169
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,289
Hey, the parcel.

170
00:15:22,259 --> 00:15:24,090
My name is Yoo Ah Yeong.

171
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,500
This is my testimony...

172
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,769
- You're not allowed in there.
- and dying letter.

173
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,870
On February 9, 2000,

174
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,379
I was brutally raped...

175
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:44,210
by Bang Jun Seok, So Phillip,
and eight others...

176
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:47,850
in a mountain near Shimbae City.

177
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,690
And Cheon Ki Soo,
a police officer,

178
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,529
harassed me.

179
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,059
Who are you?

180
00:15:58,559 --> 00:15:59,929
Mom!

181
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,899
Mom!

182
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:18,379
What is this place?
Why is it so dirty?

183
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,820
Hey.

184
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,919
I erased all of their memories...

185
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,919
and left them trembling in fear.

186
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,529
- Mom.
- Ju Ho...

187
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,100
Mom.

188
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:44,879
Mom.

189
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,379
Why her?

190
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,990
No!

191
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,730
Ju Ho.

192
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,299
Ju Ran.

193
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,210
Goodness. Why are you here?

194
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:25,609
Ju Ran. Mom is...

195
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:01,579
Ju Ho.

196
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,549
Ju Ho.

197
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,480
Go to Mr. Eun's house.

198
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:10,420
I'll be there soon, okay?

199
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,710
The one who erased your memory...

200
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:09,079
is you.

201
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,359
You have the same ability as I do.

202
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,170
You can read, erase,

203
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,000
and alter one's memory.

204
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,140
It's a very powerful ability.

205
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:55,930
I've located Sung Ju Ran.

206
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,730
Then did you keep her captive
all this time?

207
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,529
What do you mean?

208
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,140
We worked together.

209
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,640
Sung Ju Ran knew.

210
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,210
Just killing them...

211
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,450
wouldn't be proper revenge.

212
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:19,920
Because of our superpowers,

213
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,250
we went through hardships
we didn't have to.

214
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:25,960
If justice can't be found,

215
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:29,029
what's the point
of having such a power?

216
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,869
We can't even punish the bad.

217
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,670
What do we need these powers for?

218
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,589
Humans are weak.

219
00:22:00,259 --> 00:22:01,890
That's why they made laws...

220
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:08,029
with a false expectation
that it'll protect justice.

221
00:22:10,299 --> 00:22:12,299
But you saw how laws...

222
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,240
were used, didn't you?

223
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:16,210
It only protects those with power.

224
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,779
There's no need...

225
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,710
for us to rely on such laws.

226
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:26,220
Don't you agree?

227
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:41,299
You shoot him.

228
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:57,950
No.

229
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,049
I don't agree.

230
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,190
Just because we're dealing
with scumbags...

231
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,960
doesn't mean
I have to become one too.

232
00:23:13,059 --> 00:23:15,970
Ju Ran... No.

233
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,700
You.

234
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:22,440
What you did was wrong.

235
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,609
You looked into the monsters' abyss
for too long.

236
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,440
That's why you turned into
a monster too.

237
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,250
You became a monster
while fighting monsters!

238
00:23:36,450 --> 00:23:39,259
Did I become a monster
while fighting monsters?

239
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,700
Who am I fighting against?

240
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,529
What is "a monster"?

241
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:52,640
If I'm a monster, what are you?

242
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:56,809
If I'm a monster,

243
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,210
- kill me.
- No...

244
00:24:08,349 --> 00:24:09,490
Kill me!

245
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:18,529
No!

246
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,029
Kill me!

247
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:25,000
No!

248
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,549
How long are you going to do this?

249
00:24:41,049 --> 00:24:42,420
How did you turn like this?

250
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,660
What ruined you so?

251
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:46,890
Wake up.

252
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:51,799
That's why people call
someone like you weak.

253
00:24:52,859 --> 00:24:56,430
You let people trample over you,
and you won't take any action.

254
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,069
Letting them do that
means I'm strong!

255
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,900
It takes more courage...

256
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:03,440
to keep your principles.

257
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,680
You must endure...

258
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:10,250
and not let the abyss
swallow you up.

259
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:11,309
1, 2, 3.

260
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:14,220
Blue skies, milky ways

261
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,549
A white boat

262
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,190
One cinnamon tree

263
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,390
Where did you learn that?

264
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,059
Is that how you do it?

265
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,289
He's good.

266
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:26,430
What is that?

267
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,430
Yes, yes, yes.

268
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,769
Oh my.

269
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,269
Remaining who you are...

270
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:35,269
is being truly strong.

271
00:25:40,609 --> 00:25:42,250
My dear brother,
you're weak to your bones.

272
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,289
Let's say the one who lasts
until the end is the strongest.

273
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,230
Happy?

274
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:43,170
Sung Ju Ran, it's over. Stop.

275
00:26:45,109 --> 00:26:46,180
"Stop"?

276
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:48,609
Stop what?

277
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,910
Stop what?

278
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,519
I won't let you use me anymore.

279
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:02,430
No!

280
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:45,099
It's going to be hard.

281
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:46,700
The injury isn't serious.

282
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,769
You can save her.

283
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:50,369
It's not the injury
that's the problem.

284
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,450
She's in the same critical state
you were in.

285
00:27:55,849 --> 00:27:57,980
No, she's in
the worst state possible.

286
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,519
Sung Ju Ran is dying.

287
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:04,119
I'll take over from here.

288
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,619
Could the two of you give us
some privacy?

289
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,160
I'll go see the patient, then.

290
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,539
Your sister...
No, you and your sister both...

291
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,940
were under the surveillance of
the National Intelligence Service.

292
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:31,980
Let's change that to "observation".

293
00:28:32,349 --> 00:28:35,519
Anyway, something unprecedented...

294
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:37,390
was happening in Korea.

295
00:28:37,849 --> 00:28:38,960
Just get to the point.

296
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:45,599
For 20 years, we had Sung Ju Ran
protected in isolation.

297
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:49,170
Her condition worsened
the more she used her abilities.

298
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:53,140
When she first came to our lab,
Sung Ju Ran...

299
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,799
was uncontrollable.

300
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,309
There was no meaning
in keeping her protected.

301
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,480
She had come to us
when she passed her limit.

302
00:29:01,579 --> 00:29:02,849
She was in the worst state.

303
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,250
We don't have...

304
00:29:06,579 --> 00:29:09,519
any basis to say you'd have
the same patterns as her.

305
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:10,890
That's why...

306
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,059
we'd like to be extra thorough
while we protect you...

307
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:17,359
Ju Ran and I never asked
any of you to help us.

308
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,829
We're not national assets...

309
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,029
nor animals in a zoo.

310
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,900
Let's compromise.

311
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:28,740
I'll help you erase your concerns
and memories about your sister.

312
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:31,509
"Compromise"? No.

313
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,140
Call it a threat.

314
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,750
I had too many unwanted contacts
with NIS agents, especially you.

315
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,920
The whole world's eyes are on me.

316
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,519
It's perfect timing.

317
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:46,789
Is your condition...

318
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:51,829
for the threat to erase the memories
of you and your sister?

319
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,500
Well, this isn't something
I can decide on my own.

320
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,539
But I'll still relay
the seriousness of the message.

321
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:04,069
You don't like negotiating,

322
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:06,710
so should I threaten you too?

323
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:10,309
Whatever information you acquired,

324
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,849
take it to your grave
no matter what it is.

325
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:17,490
If you leak any information,
the problem will get serious.

326
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,720
It'll be on a national level.

327
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:22,960
I can't trust you,

328
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,430
but I'll try.

329
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,460
It's a compromise, after all.

330
00:30:29,599 --> 00:30:32,640
Per our deal, I'll get out
of your sight right away.

331
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,250
With the national petition's help,
the National Assembly...

332
00:30:46,250 --> 00:30:50,019
is actively discussing a joint
investigation on the Shimbae case.

333
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,990
20 years ago in Shimbae City,
a mass slaughter case happened.

334
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:57,089
It's suspected that Deputy Chief
Lee Shin Woong...

335
00:30:57,089 --> 00:30:58,900
of the National Police Agency
was the mastermind...

336
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,759
as the prosecution investigates.

337
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:04,369
Back in 2000, those convicted
of bribing Deputy Chief Lee...

338
00:31:04,369 --> 00:31:05,970
They're sacrificing me...

339
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,799
They are searching
Cheon Ki Soo residence for...

340
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,269
so they can get out of it.

341
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,710
Dad.

342
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:14,779
It wasn't really you, was it?

343
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,950
That's the current prediction.

344
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:23,220
When Moon Yong Dae came later
for Yoo Ah Yeong,

345
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,150
Bang Jun Seok beat him
with a nailed bat.

346
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,619
He sprayed alcohol and set Moon
on fire, causing burns.

347
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:29,660
In the end, Moon Yong Dae was
pushed off a cliff and died.

348
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:33,430
After that, in order to make
Moon's death accidental,

349
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,930
Hwang Pil Sun conspired
with Deputy Chief Lee Shin Woong.

350
00:31:45,339 --> 00:31:46,339
You can continue.

351
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,750
Deputy Chief Lee
instigated Cheon Ki Soo...

352
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,490
to cover up Moon's death.

353
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:18,039
Captain Koo, can you hear me?

354
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,480
Hold on.

355
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,910
Hey! The patient woke up!

356
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,019
Se Hoon.

357
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:30,019
Do you recognize me?

358
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:33,289
Your wife
went to the convenience store.

359
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,630
What about Baek?

360
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:39,859
Where is he?

361
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,730
He's...

362
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:47,569
He's busy catching the bad guys...

363
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,140
as always.

364
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:30,450
You're too kind.

365
00:33:34,849 --> 00:33:35,950
Ju Ran.

366
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:42,190
I haven't heard you call me
like that in a while.

367
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,500
You were a kind person too.

368
00:33:52,339 --> 00:33:55,410
It'll be hard for you to become
someone like me.

369
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,779
Why...

370
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,509
Why did you have to go this far?

371
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,849
"This far"?

372
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:12,019
I'm disappointed that this is...

373
00:34:12,559 --> 00:34:14,260
all that I have done.

374
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,699
There was no need for you
to kill everyone.

375
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,900
Who'd do it if not me?

376
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,739
I'm still convinced...

377
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,110
if I hadn't started what I did,

378
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:37,610
nothing would've happened...

379
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:40,050
to those people even now.

380
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,420
But...

381
00:34:44,389 --> 00:34:46,460
there are other ways.

382
00:34:49,829 --> 00:34:52,429
Yoo Ah Yeong left her testimony
with you,

383
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:54,559
and with your abilities,

384
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:57,000
you could've found out
who made the orders.

385
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,469
You should've...

386
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,940
made better choices.

387
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:09,679
Ju Ho.

388
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,320
Memories don't have any power.

389
00:35:18,090 --> 00:35:19,719
There's no power...

390
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:23,130
in what people remember.

391
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,099
Ah Yeong's memories,

392
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:31,929
and mine too.

393
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:38,110
You can't do anything with them.

394
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:44,050
Okay, stop.

395
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:53,119
I'll give you something...

396
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,090
that'll help you decide.

397
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,690
Ju Ran, I'll erase...

398
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:35,130
all your bad memories for you.

399
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,170
The problem is, we have more than
enough circumstances to show...

400
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,309
Bang Jun Seok murdered
Moon Yong Dae,

401
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,309
but there is no definite evidence.

402
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,739
The statute of limitations remains
since he went abroad to study.

403
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,750
At this rate, we won't be able
to imprison Bang Jun Seok.

404
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,849
We never worked while
taking such things into account.

405
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,650
Let's just do what we can.

406
00:37:27,019 --> 00:37:29,389
What do we do
about Deputy Chief Lee?

407
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,469
Arrest Kim Do Su of
the Intelligence Agency right away!

408
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:48,039
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

409
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,679
I plan to go see Deputy Chief Lee.

410
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:57,010
Without a warrant?

411
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:58,710
There's something I need
to get from him before.

412
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,119
Can you promise to be courteous?

413
00:38:06,889 --> 00:38:07,960
It's my earnest request.

414
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,889
I will.

415
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,500
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

416
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:21,469
It hurts too much.

417
00:38:22,269 --> 00:38:23,610
Honey.

418
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:26,079
Here.

419
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,250
There.

420
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:52,500
I'm glad your son is better.

421
00:38:58,909 --> 00:39:02,079
When you first came in
for your interview,

422
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,250
you were my son's age, right?

423
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,480
Yes.

424
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,389
Why did you apply to become
a police officer...

425
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:11,789
instead of becoming a prosecutor?

426
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:13,989
You asked me the same question
during my interview.

427
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:18,389
Did I?

428
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,699
I knew prosecutors would review
case records all day...

429
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,130
while being stuck in the office.

430
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,340
That's true.

431
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:32,809
Many people were against it
when I hired you.

432
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,710
It was unprecedented...

433
00:39:34,909 --> 00:39:37,280
to have someone under 30
for special employment

434
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:40,849
I know you pushed hard for me.

435
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:45,820
Customs should be broken
in order for organizations to grow.

436
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:50,059
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

437
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,360
Was the warrant issued?

438
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,969
It will be.

439
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,769
Inspector Kim Do Su confessed
as well.

440
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,510
What will I be charged with?

441
00:40:03,269 --> 00:40:05,780
The statute of limitations for
the Shimbae incident has passed,

442
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:08,039
but you'll be charged with
nine charges...

443
00:40:08,039 --> 00:40:09,550
including abuse of authority.

444
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:14,280
I guess my sentence will add up
quite a bit.

445
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:17,719
Don't get cocky.

446
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:22,119
I'll never crumble like this.

447
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:24,989
I'll always stay alert.

448
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,130
Senior Superintendent Han.

449
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:33,269
Seeing that you've come alone,

450
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:36,010
I guess there's a good reason.

451
00:40:39,179 --> 00:40:42,440
I came to ask you
to choose to protect...

452
00:40:42,949 --> 00:40:44,449
the honor of our police force.

453
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:48,150
I'm about to hit rock bottom,

454
00:40:49,489 --> 00:40:52,219
yet you want me to give you
evidence to catch Hwang Pil Sun?

455
00:40:57,389 --> 00:40:58,489
Sun Mi.

456
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:02,260
When you hold out your hand
to a man hanging from a cliff,

457
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,099
you need to show him hope.

458
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:10,110
But right now,
I don't see any hope...

459
00:41:10,969 --> 00:41:12,369
in the hand you have held out to me.

460
00:41:14,010 --> 00:41:15,239
The hope that I could live.

461
00:41:57,789 --> 00:41:58,949
Well, sir.

462
00:41:59,659 --> 00:42:01,820
We have a warrant.

463
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:08,730
Shall we?

464
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:06,840
Move. We're here for
Chairwoman Hwang Pil Sun.

465
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,309
Come on, move aside.

466
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:11,750
- Move.
- You can't go in.

467
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,920
- We're policemen.
- Move!

468
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,119
Get out of the way!

469
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,190
- Move!
- You jerk!

470
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,559
Please move.

471
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:31,429
Chairwoman Hwang Pil Sun,
we're here to arrest you.

472
00:45:33,239 --> 00:45:34,869
How dare you come in here?

473
00:45:35,969 --> 00:45:37,469
- Hey, Mr. Lim.
- Yes?

474
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,539
Sue that woman right now!

475
00:45:43,679 --> 00:45:46,480
Senior Superintendent Han.
You seem to be way over your head...

476
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,050
by merely believing the words
of a crazy man with superpowers.

477
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:49,320
As you can see,

478
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:52,989
we are very busy dealing with people
who have spread groundless rumors.

479
00:45:53,389 --> 00:45:54,489
So you should...

480
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:58,929
Chairwoman Hwang Pil Sun.

481
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,260
You are under arrest
for conspiracy to commit murder,

482
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:02,429
bribery, and blackmail.

483
00:46:02,829 --> 00:46:05,070
Senior Superintendent Han!
How dare you say that!

484
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:08,300
- Do you have a warrant?
- Stop it.

485
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,070
Have some dignity,
for goodness' sake.

486
00:46:11,639 --> 00:46:12,769
I'm sorry.

487
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,909
Senior Superintendent Han,
choose your words wisely in here.

488
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:20,219
That's how you should act
in front of me.

489
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:26,559
Let me kindly explain one more time.

490
00:46:28,289 --> 00:46:29,389
Ms. Hwang Pil Sun.

491
00:46:30,429 --> 00:46:32,130
You are under arrest...

492
00:46:32,130 --> 00:46:34,059
for conspiracy to commit murder,
bribery, and blackmail.

493
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:45,639
How interesting. It really is.

494
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,809
Then shall we go?

495
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,920
Move aside, you lowly servants.

496
00:46:58,489 --> 00:46:59,590
Have some dignity.

497
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:03,789
You crazy jerks.

498
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:06,800
Call the Public Prosecutor General
now.

499
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:07,800
Yes, sir.

500
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:12,530
Chairwoman Hwang.

501
00:47:21,639 --> 00:47:23,550
Senior Superintendent Han,
where's Baek?

502
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,349
Where did he go?

503
00:47:28,349 --> 00:47:29,590
Yes, sir.

504
00:47:29,949 --> 00:47:31,650
Why is it so hard
to get a hold of you?

505
00:47:31,789 --> 00:47:33,289
What on earth is going on?

506
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:35,719
How could Chairwoman Hwang
go to the police station?

507
00:47:36,059 --> 00:47:38,989
There's even a national petition
in progress, and I have no choice.

508
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:40,760
We shouldn't call each other
for the time being.

509
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:43,530
- Goodbye.
- Sir, sir!

510
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,539
Darn it.

511
00:48:06,789 --> 00:48:07,920
Well, well.

512
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:11,590
You're a criminal
who should be investigated.

513
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:12,889
Why is it the other way around?

514
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,130
I heard the prosecution
pointed you out...

515
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:19,099
as a prime suspect.

516
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:23,409
I came here to be investigated too.

517
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:25,769
For all the crimes I've committed.

518
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,039
Dad.

519
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,380
I think everything is a lie.

520
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:35,449
I'm going to trust you
until the end.

521
00:48:36,889 --> 00:48:40,260
I know you're a good policeman.

522
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:45,559
"A sinner should pay for his sins."

523
00:48:46,329 --> 00:48:49,360
I forgot that for a long time.
But that was...

524
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,829
my belief.

525
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:03,980
(Reference materials on
Bang Jun Seok, W Group, Woo Seok Do)

526
00:49:08,619 --> 00:49:09,719
You scumbag.

527
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:16,389
Were you...

528
00:49:17,389 --> 00:49:20,960
always this ignorant and foolish,
Lee Shin Woong?

529
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:24,769
Let me tell you again
from the beginning.

530
00:49:25,730 --> 00:49:29,269
I won't be staying here for long.

531
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:42,920
You don't have to stay here
for long.

532
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:46,519
We have plenty of evidence.

533
00:49:48,489 --> 00:49:49,590
Senior Superintendent Han.

534
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:51,760
The investigation will be over
in no time.

535
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,269
Ms. Hwang Pil Sun.

536
00:49:57,699 --> 00:49:59,800
Do you want to make a bet
with me...

537
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:01,670
on how long you'll be in prison?

538
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:05,039
You're overconfident
and don't know your place.

539
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:08,239
You must not know about me.

540
00:50:10,510 --> 00:50:14,150
I'll make sure you never
disrespect me like this.

541
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:16,519
I'll teach you one more time.

542
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:21,559
How unfortunate. You don't know
how much the world has changed.

543
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:24,260
There are many people like me now.

544
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:32,900
Why don't we start with the cases...

545
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:34,670
where the statute of limitations
is still valid?

546
00:50:48,650 --> 00:50:51,250
Sir, the situation seems bad.

547
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:52,489
What do you mean?

548
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,789
The Public Prosecutor General
has severed contact with us...

549
00:50:54,789 --> 00:50:56,559
and I'm about to be investigated.

550
00:50:56,730 --> 00:50:59,389
You should try using
your other connections for now...

551
00:51:00,059 --> 00:51:02,500
Then what about me?
Will I be arrested too?

552
00:51:04,099 --> 00:51:05,829
You need to get Chairwoman Hwang
released first.

553
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:07,139
That's how we'll all live.

554
00:51:07,869 --> 00:51:09,670
- So try calling...
- Come outside.

555
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:13,780
What? We need to get
Chairwoman Hwang released.

556
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:17,050
I'll have to live first in order to
save my mom or something. Come out!

557
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:29,889
Assemblyman Bang Jun Seok.

558
00:51:31,590 --> 00:51:33,329
Where are you going?
I came here to see you.

559
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,659
- What for?
- Baek!

560
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,170
We're not ready
for Bang Jun Seok yet.

561
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,340
Oh, the evidence.

562
00:51:59,289 --> 00:52:01,659
What about that?
What does that have to do with me?

563
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,090
Shut your mouth and watch.
It gets interesting from here.

564
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,230
How cute. Come here.

565
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,239
Open your mouth.

566
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:19,309
Come here.

567
00:52:20,139 --> 00:52:22,909
Do you know who I am?

568
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,579
I'm Bang Jun Seok!

569
00:52:26,179 --> 00:52:28,380
I'm Bang Jun Seok!

570
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:30,320
What?

571
00:52:32,389 --> 00:52:34,420
I have more, but I'll show you later
someplace quiet...

572
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:35,889
since I lack patience.

573
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:45,630
As of now, the murder suspect
Bang Jun Seok is under arrest.

574
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,139
- Det. Oh.
- Yes, sir.

575
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:49,199
Please take Mr. Bang Jun Seok
to where he belongs.

576
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:50,570
I'll be there soon.

577
00:52:52,070 --> 00:52:53,210
Let's go.

578
00:52:54,039 --> 00:52:56,010
You have the right an attorney...

579
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:59,210
and to make an appeal
against wrongful arrest.

580
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:01,650
Mr. Attorney.

581
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:07,860
Can you look over there? Yes.

582
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:09,820
Are you guys insane? Let go!

583
00:53:10,329 --> 00:53:12,460
How dare you policemen
put your hands on me?

584
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:15,300
Hey, stop shooting.
Which station are you from?

585
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,500
Mr. Oh, is it true you left
the victim of an abduction case...

586
00:53:18,630 --> 00:53:21,500
to die in order to cover up
Lim Joong Yeon's bribery scandal?

587
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,869
What are you talking about?
Get out of my face!

588
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:25,710
Dong Baek, you...

589
00:53:26,809 --> 00:53:28,840
Han Sun Mi, don't you know who I am?

590
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:31,550
Do you think I won't find
anything dirty about you?

591
00:53:31,949 --> 00:53:33,650
You just wait. I'll make you pay!

592
00:53:33,650 --> 00:53:36,320
I won't be the person I am
if I get intimidated by that.

593
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,449
Get yourself an attorney
and wait for your turn.

594
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:44,230
Since you're not on the same level,
you'll have to wait.

595
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:46,929
Mr. Lim.

596
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:49,829
Mr. Lim, say something!

597
00:53:49,969 --> 00:53:53,170
- They're framing me!
- Please say something, Mr. Lim.

598
00:53:53,170 --> 00:53:57,010
Did you really force Mr. Oh
to cover up your scandal?

599
00:53:58,269 --> 00:53:59,309
No.

600
00:53:59,539 --> 00:54:01,909
Do you have anything to say
to the families of the deceased?

601
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:05,480
Well, I don't think I have
anything to say.

602
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:09,989
Catch him. I said, catch him!

603
00:54:10,449 --> 00:54:13,250
I'm merely a puppet.
He's the one who leads everything!

604
00:54:13,489 --> 00:54:14,920
Why are you all gathered here?

605
00:54:15,989 --> 00:54:18,590
We have a lot to talk about
starting today.

606
00:54:19,030 --> 00:54:20,230
Take them upstairs.

607
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:21,800
Hey, wait.

608
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:25,130
Hey, what are you doing?
How dare you?

609
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,699
Do you know who I am?
Let go!

610
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:29,500
They're so well-mannered.

611
00:54:30,039 --> 00:54:31,739
They were already gathered here
before I called for them.

612
00:54:32,010 --> 00:54:33,039
Ma'am.

613
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,010
It's been a long time.

614
00:54:36,710 --> 00:54:38,510
The special investigation
will begin today.

615
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:41,650
There's not much left
for you to do now.

616
00:54:42,179 --> 00:54:44,449
I'm afraid I'll be taking away
all your work.

617
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:47,019
Like I said before,
that's your ticket to becoming...

618
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,059
a star prosecutor of this country.

619
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:55,860
Can you please quiet down?
This is a public place.

620
00:54:56,429 --> 00:54:58,429
You men should know better
in your position.

621
00:54:58,769 --> 00:55:00,400
I said, let me go!

622
00:55:00,539 --> 00:55:02,340
You punks! Let go of me!

623
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:04,670
So I guess you made a decision.

624
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:06,840
To see you here in broad daylight.

625
00:55:07,909 --> 00:55:10,280
Decision? I never made any decision.

626
00:55:10,710 --> 00:55:12,110
I wasn't swayed from the beginning.

627
00:55:15,019 --> 00:55:17,150
By the way, where did you find
that evidence?

628
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,219
In someone's memory.

629
00:55:27,929 --> 00:55:29,659
What are you doing with that rag?

630
00:55:30,170 --> 00:55:33,329
What do you mean, a rag?
It's a towel.

631
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,699
A rag is always a rag,
no matter how much you wash it.

632
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:37,739
Do you know how hard I washed this?

633
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:39,239
Old Man!

634
00:55:39,539 --> 00:55:41,079
You're here. Good job.

635
00:55:41,739 --> 00:55:44,380
I was so worried about you, Old Man.

636
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:46,449
Come here, Old Man.

637
00:55:48,679 --> 00:55:52,050
As long as you don't stress me out,
I can live until I'm 100.

638
00:55:52,050 --> 00:55:54,889
Take Se Hoon away.
He keeps whining, and it's annoying.

639
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:57,630
That's so upsetting.

640
00:55:57,829 --> 00:56:00,599
Do you know how much I devoted
myself in taking care of you?

641
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:01,630
I quit!

642
00:56:03,099 --> 00:56:04,630
Did you think I'd say that?

643
00:56:04,829 --> 00:56:07,570
- Old Man.
- Captain Koo.

644
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:10,269
- Old Man.
- We were worried about you.

645
00:56:10,269 --> 00:56:12,739
- Have you two gone mad?
- Old Man.

646
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,309
Look how swollen his head is.
My gosh.

647
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:17,380
- It must hurt so much.
- It's always swollen.

648
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:20,320
It's not because of the pain.
It's just fat.

649
00:56:20,579 --> 00:56:22,349
Did you think carefully
before making your choice?

650
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:26,389
I made my choice too late.

651
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:29,059
It will be a huge loss
for this country's police force...

652
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,389
to lose a talented individual
like you.

653
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:43,510
I believe I've finished my duties
as a policewoman.

654
00:56:58,119 --> 00:56:59,190
Good luck.

655
00:57:00,519 --> 00:57:01,789
Attorney Han Sun Mi.

656
00:57:03,789 --> 00:57:05,030
Thank you.

(Regional Investigation Unit)

658
00:57:20,179 --> 00:57:22,380
It is a bit disappointing.

659
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:25,280
Women like you should be the ones
who protect our country.

660
00:57:25,710 --> 00:57:27,349
- Don't you think?
- Of course.

661
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:29,550
Ms. Han, can you please reconsider?

662
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:33,349
I agree. Whose order must we follow
from now on?

663
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:39,389
I'd like to sincerely thank...

664
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:43,670
all of you for following a young,
rude boss like me...

665
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:47,070
all this time.

666
00:57:53,070 --> 00:57:54,280
Here.

667
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:59,610
Senior Superintendent Han.
Thank you.

668
00:58:02,019 --> 00:58:04,250
It was an honor to work for you!

669
00:58:05,449 --> 00:58:06,860
- It was an honor!
- Thank you!

670
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:19,829
Thank you so much.

671
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:30,809
Good job.

672
00:59:03,579 --> 00:59:05,849
Hyun Soo, you got some on you.
Hold on a second.

673
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:10,389
There we go. Let's go.

674
00:59:37,849 --> 00:59:40,349
Sang... Sang Ah.

675
00:59:44,090 --> 00:59:46,989
Hee Tae. Do you remember me?

676
00:59:47,619 --> 00:59:49,059
Do you remember everything?

677
00:59:50,730 --> 00:59:51,829
Hyun Soo.

678
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:54,030
Our son, Hyun Soo.

679
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,360
Hyun Soo.

680
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:00,300
Mom, it's Mr. Dong Baek.

681
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:03,440
Mr. Dong Baek?

682
01:00:06,539 --> 01:00:08,510
Don't be relieved.
We'll still have to see.

683
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:11,880
As your doctor, it's too early
to make an official judgment.

684
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,150
Your sister as well.

685
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:15,150
Just tell me the numbers
on the test results.

686
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,460
Fine, then.

687
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:28,260
I don't know why,
but the unstable numbers...

688
01:00:28,429 --> 01:00:30,730
have come back to normal.
All of them.

689
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:33,630
Despite how good the results are,

690
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,869
it's unreliable
if we don't know the cause.

691
01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:40,909
I think I know why.

692
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:44,750
After my brain let go
of 20 years' worth of memories,

693
01:00:45,179 --> 01:00:46,510
everything is back to normal.

694
01:00:47,179 --> 01:00:49,550
So I was the one who was blocking
my own ability.

695
01:00:50,250 --> 01:00:51,489
Can you explain in detail?

696
01:00:51,789 --> 01:00:54,360
I need to know everything
about you...

697
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:56,519
I can't explain in detail.

698
01:00:56,989 --> 01:01:00,860
You know that everything
that has happened to me...

699
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,329
is unexplainable in words.

700
01:01:10,269 --> 01:01:12,539
Chairwoman Hwang Pil Sun and
former assemblyman Bang Jun Seok,

701
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:13,809
who were charged with murder,

702
01:01:13,809 --> 01:01:16,539
conspiracy to commit murder,
and bribery...

703
01:01:16,710 --> 01:01:20,849
were each sentenced to 20 years
and 18 years on their second trial.

704
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:24,050
They each received another two years
compared to their first trial.

705
01:01:24,449 --> 01:01:27,019
Chief Prosecutor Yeo Ji Sook
has also stated...

706
01:01:27,019 --> 01:01:30,730
that she will commence
a special investigation...

707
01:01:30,989 --> 01:01:32,889
in order to crack down on all the
corrupt individuals...

708
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:35,329
who are suspected to be involved
with Chairwoman Hwang Pil Sun.

709
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:39,199
As a result, the black connections
within the political,

710
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:41,340
financial, and media world
that corrupted this country...

711
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:42,539
with their abuse of power is...

712
01:01:42,570 --> 01:01:44,969
expected to be brought
to justice.

713
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:48,139
The shouts of our people
seeking justice...

714
01:01:48,139 --> 01:01:49,239
is getting louder than ever.

715
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:51,849
This is Kang Ji Eun of OBC News.

716
01:01:56,219 --> 01:01:57,320
Get out!

717
01:01:58,789 --> 01:02:02,590
Hey. What are you getting paid for?

718
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,989
Go and bring something useful...

719
01:02:04,989 --> 01:02:07,099
or make up something at least,
you good-for-nothing punks!

720
01:02:07,699 --> 01:02:09,159
What are you doing? Get out!

721
01:02:34,059 --> 01:02:35,190
Mom.

722
01:02:39,389 --> 01:02:40,500
Mom...

723
01:03:21,139 --> 01:03:24,039
Inmate 1605, Hwang Pil Sun.

724
01:03:26,510 --> 01:03:29,780
Your son committed suicide
last night.

725
01:04:28,670 --> 01:04:30,469
No!

726
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:36,940
Hwang Pil Sun.

727
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,679
Because of your dreadful mom,

728
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:44,050
you will die a horrible death.

729
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:49,690
You will die in
the most terrible way imaginable.

730
01:04:58,630 --> 01:04:59,730
(Attorney Han Sun Mi)

731
01:05:01,739 --> 01:05:04,269
Professor Han, you keep getting
flower pots congratulating you.

732
01:05:04,369 --> 01:05:05,469
Congratulations on opening
your office.

733
01:05:05,969 --> 01:05:07,210
(Congratulations,
National Police Agency)

734
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:09,880
You better not regret it.

735
01:05:10,849 --> 01:05:12,449
Human rights lawyers
barely make enough money.

736
01:05:13,179 --> 01:05:15,150
So you'll be paid
very little as well.

737
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,489
You should choose wisely.

738
01:05:17,489 --> 01:05:20,420
I'll always choose you,
Professor Han.

739
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:30,159
- Hello.
- It's been a long time.

740
01:05:30,530 --> 01:05:31,630
- Hi.
- Thank you.

741
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:34,599
Superintendent Han.

742
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:36,869
I mean, Attorney Han,
congratulations.

743
01:05:37,139 --> 01:05:38,639
Welcome, Captain Koo.

744
01:05:38,909 --> 01:05:40,610
I'm so glad you recovered.

745
01:05:40,679 --> 01:05:43,579
Although I don't have superpowers,
I'm as strong as Hulk.

746
01:05:43,579 --> 01:05:45,079
Hulk, my foot.

747
01:05:45,079 --> 01:05:46,610
He almost came back from the dead.

748
01:05:56,059 --> 01:05:58,360
(Tissues, toilet paper)

749
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:06,969
I told you we shouldn't have bought
toilet paper!

750
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,039
- You did?
- Yes!

751
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:18,110
Congratulations on starting
your own practice!

752
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:19,849
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

753
01:06:19,849 --> 01:06:21,250
Even you guys came.

754
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:24,320
- Congratulations.
- You were here.

755
01:06:25,389 --> 01:06:27,559
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations, ma'am.

756
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:30,159
- Congratulations.
- This place makes good Chinese.

757
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:34,500
Why don't we all take a picture?

758
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:35,829
I'll take one for you.

759
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:37,159
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

760
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:38,699
What picture?

761
01:06:38,699 --> 01:06:40,130
You can stand in the middle.

762
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,639
- Ms. Han.
- Come here.

763
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:48,639
- Move aside.
- I'll take it now.

764
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:50,710
Cheese.

765
01:06:51,010 --> 01:06:52,610
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

766
01:07:04,329 --> 01:07:05,429
How pretty.

767
01:07:05,530 --> 01:07:06,559
- What are you doing?
- Did you take it?

768
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:07,730
What...

769
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:10,260
- Did you take it?
- Let me take it again.

770
01:07:11,070 --> 01:07:12,170
Say cheese.

771
01:07:20,010 --> 01:07:22,679
- Show it to us.
- That's amazing.

772
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:24,849
- Hey.
- Wait.

773
01:07:26,179 --> 01:07:27,349
- What?
- What is that?

774
01:07:27,719 --> 01:07:30,519
You only shot Reporter Kang.

775
01:07:30,849 --> 01:07:33,119
- I did?
- What is that?

776
01:07:33,119 --> 01:07:34,219
Report it to the police then.

777
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:35,889
I can't believe it.

778
01:07:37,829 --> 01:07:38,960
Is there something going on
between you two?

779
01:07:39,929 --> 01:07:41,460
- No...
- There will be from now on.

780
01:07:44,570 --> 01:07:46,670
- Look at this.
- I'm a good catch.

781
01:07:47,170 --> 01:07:48,269
I'm going to report you.

782
01:07:49,639 --> 01:07:50,809
Report him now.

783
01:07:51,210 --> 01:07:53,340
- Let me see.
- That looks good.

784
01:07:54,579 --> 01:07:55,610
I'm self-reflecting.

785
01:07:56,139 --> 01:07:58,750
- I didn't ask.
- I wasn't answering either.

786
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:02,449
Why? What did you do wrong
this time?

787
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,550
It's not this time. I've always
done things wrong all along.

788
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,460
You must've done something
really bad.

789
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:11,559
Who is the victim?

790
01:08:14,659 --> 01:08:17,770
Tell me. So I can protect
that person's human rights.

791
01:08:19,729 --> 01:08:21,670
Up until now, I thought...

792
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:24,539
my ability was to read
people's memories.

793
01:08:25,039 --> 01:08:26,539
That is your ability.

794
01:08:27,840 --> 01:08:30,880
But it wasn't just memories.

795
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:35,579
I was reading people's thoughts,

796
01:08:36,619 --> 01:08:37,890
what was on their minds,

797
01:08:38,689 --> 01:08:39,819
and even their time.

798
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:43,289
It was the process
of learning all of that.

799
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:49,960
I only used this ability
as a certain measure until now.

800
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:52,529
I just reached out
and touched anyone.

801
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:55,199
That's why I'm self-reflecting.

802
01:08:57,510 --> 01:09:00,670
You've never sounded so admirable
all this time.

803
01:09:01,039 --> 01:09:02,079
I'm surprised.

804
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:04,109
I know, I even surprise myself.

805
01:09:06,079 --> 01:09:08,380
So? You won't use
your ability from now on?

806
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:11,350
No, of course, I'll use it.
For a good cause.

807
01:09:11,489 --> 01:09:13,550
I'll use it well
with a sincere heart.

808
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:18,229
Det. Dong.

809
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:25,029
Thank you for everything.

810
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:32,739
I look forward to your cooperation
from now on.

811
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:38,850
Senior Superintendent Han.

812
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:52,560
Based on the national petition
that received more than...

813
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,789
eight million votes,

814
01:09:53,859 --> 01:09:55,960
the National Assembly has passed
the "Supernatural Power Law".

815
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:59,300
The Seoul Metropolitan
Police Agency has also created...

816
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:01,000
a Supernatural Power Team to
fight violent crimes...

817
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:04,539
and stated that they will place
Det. Dong at the very head...

818
01:10:04,539 --> 01:10:07,470
in order to guarantee the safety
of our people.

819
01:10:07,939 --> 01:10:09,739
With the enactment of the
Supernatural Power Law,

820
01:10:09,739 --> 01:10:11,550
people are expecting...

821
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:14,779
the safety and public order of
our country to be strengthened.

822
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:17,119
This is Kang Ji Eun of OBC News.

823
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:23,090
I'm here.

824
01:10:43,409 --> 01:10:45,180
A hiker found her and reported it.

825
01:10:45,649 --> 01:10:47,819
It's been two days since she died.

826
01:10:48,119 --> 01:10:49,649
We'll know more from an autopsy,

827
01:10:49,649 --> 01:10:51,420
but it seems like the cause of death
is the knife wound on her stomach.

828
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:53,090
Did you check her identity?

829
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:57,390
Her name is Shin Mi Yeong,
age 43, and she's a housewife.

830
01:10:57,729 --> 01:10:59,489
Where on earth is that punk
Dong Baek?

831
01:11:00,329 --> 01:11:01,729
- I don't know.
- Does he think...

832
01:11:01,729 --> 01:11:03,600
he's the police commissioner
or something?

833
01:11:03,829 --> 01:11:05,630
- He never shows up.
- Ta-da.

834
01:11:06,069 --> 01:11:07,739
His star fever has gotten worse.

835
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:09,140
Shut your mouth before I smack you.

836
01:11:15,479 --> 01:11:16,539
Who is that?

837
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:19,079
It's the husband of the deceased,
Shin Mi Yeong.

838
01:11:19,079 --> 01:11:20,909
I heard he came back
from abroad today.

839
01:11:21,579 --> 01:11:22,779
Take him away.

840
01:11:23,149 --> 01:11:24,180
Okay.

841
01:11:27,789 --> 01:11:28,859
Mi Yeong.

842
01:11:29,489 --> 01:11:32,159
Sir, please follow me.

843
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:34,659
- We can't investigate if you...
- Detective Oh.

844
01:11:38,630 --> 01:11:42,100
I'm truly sorry for your loss.

845
01:11:42,739 --> 01:11:44,539
I'll make sure we catch
the killer...

846
01:11:46,439 --> 01:11:48,510
All I did was work.

847
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:50,810
I shouldn't have left you alone...

848
01:11:59,550 --> 01:12:02,060
You piece of... Darn it...

849
01:12:02,659 --> 01:12:04,159
- Are you out of your mind?
- "You piece of..."?

850
01:12:04,590 --> 01:12:06,689
Detective. Go check room 802
of Sungon Castle.

851
01:12:06,829 --> 01:12:08,899
- What?
- Just listen to me.

852
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:10,359
The killer is in that room.

853
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:11,500
You better hurry.

854
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:13,600
She's about
to catch a flight for 2:20pm...

855
01:12:15,399 --> 01:12:16,470
with him.

856
01:12:17,640 --> 01:12:18,869
Kim Yoon Mi.

857
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:21,640
She's your mistress
who colluded with you...

858
01:12:21,979 --> 01:12:23,109
and killed your poor wife.

859
01:12:24,949 --> 01:12:26,180
Do you have proof?

860
01:12:28,949 --> 01:12:30,319
Are you that detective
with a superpower?

861
01:12:30,949 --> 01:12:33,189
Superpowers cannot be used
to gain proof.

862
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:35,890
This is why the police
in our country...

863
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:43,399
I'm sorry. I have a habit of
going crazy when I see scum.

864
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:44,500
Hey, come here!

865
01:12:44,500 --> 01:12:46,029
He needs a good beating.

866
01:12:46,029 --> 01:12:47,970
My retirement just went down
the drain again.

867
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:51,000
- You're right about that.
- You little!

868
01:12:51,140 --> 01:12:52,869
- Stop him
- Come over here.

869
01:12:52,869 --> 01:12:54,239
Let go of me.

870
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:55,539
Let go!

871
01:12:58,210 --> 01:13:01,050
- Stop him!
- Come over here!

872
01:13:20,569 --> 01:13:24,140
(Thank you for watching Memorist.)
