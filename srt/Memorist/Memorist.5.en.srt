Why did the Creator
who is suffering with us...

00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,460
give us hardship?

36

Also,

37
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,099
why did he allow Park Gi Dan,
the human form of the Lord,

All prophets since

had to endure hardships
that were fitting to their status.

If this was the case
with human prophets,

of course, the human form
of the Lord on earth...

47
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:16,370
would indeed need to suffer...

No. It's that no one remembers...

56
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:15,689
the moment of the murder.

You're right. I'm the very devil
who'll put you behind bars.

Doesn't it sound like a declaration
of war...

against your superpower?

63
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,180
They drew attention on purpose
as if to put on a magic show.

64
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,350
Interesting.

65
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,449
Could there be someone else
with a superpower like me?

66
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:45,220
Perhaps they're stronger.

67

What if they can erase
people's memories?

68

That's why you're the prime suspect
from this moment on.

Are you joking?

70
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,899
Like you said,
I can't erase people's memories.

71

only you would know.

Go bring me a warrant.

committed with superpowers?

I will find proof that will
support both a supernatural crime...

I'm focusing on the view
of superpower for now.

- If it wasn't a superpower,

the most basic possibilities.

Are you suggesting this is
by a second superpower person?

It might not be a second person.

What do you mean by that?

- I'll speak once I have the result.

00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,279
why I've been keeping him in check?

125
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,649
- It's not my position to ask.
- Isn't it strange...

126
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,889
to see me nervous because
of someone with a superpower?

127
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,590
Do you think it's because
I have something to hide?

than 120,000 police officers.

162
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:52,440
I'm the only one who knows
the structure and the faces.

163
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:55,809
So where exactly did you see
those scenes?

164
00:12:56,649 --> 00:12:58,120
I'll tell you when it's time.

165
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,750
And when is that?

166
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,519
Answer me.

167
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:04,389
A delivery van brought that painting
two days ago.

168
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:07,529
You guys don't have
such paintings around here, right?

169
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:12,000
That's why we were going
to return it soon after.

170
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,100
But we didn't know the number.

171
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,230
You had no information?

172
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:16,769
No, not at all.

173
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,299
Anything you tell us will help.
Did you find anything strange?

174
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,240
Not really.

175
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:24,580
But it seemed like
Mr. Park really liked it.

176
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,419
He stared at it for hours.

177
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,820
The person was insulting him
by painting a claw hammer.

178
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:39,120
You're right. This is strange.

179
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,220
What?

180
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,129
What is it?

181
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:47,330
I don't think that was it.

182
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:48,899
What do you mean?

183
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,570
I'm pretty sure.

184
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:54,870
When I had opened it,

185
00:13:57,809 --> 00:13:59,340
it was a sword.

186
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,850
It was this long.

187
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:03,679
What's going on?

188
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,090
It was double-layered.

189
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,120
"Double-layered"?

190
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,190
The killer tore it off.

191
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,769
He was found near a rural station
at the age of seven.

192
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,639
They didn't know his name,
and he couldn't speak either.

193
00:14:30,809 --> 00:14:32,210
He was transferred
to several facilities...

194
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,580
for the handicapped and then
ended up at an orphanage.

195
00:14:33,779 --> 00:14:36,409
He got his name from the station
he was found at.

196
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:38,179
Nothing in particular stands out
while he was growing up.

197
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:40,649
He told the public
about his superpower when he was 20.

198
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,360
He rejected all job offers
then suddenly became a detective.

199
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,659
- Why?
- He did an interview.

200
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,360
The boundary between
what's right or wrong is clear...

201
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,700
when you're a detective.

202
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:54,870
What a lunatic.

203
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,940
He refused a job that'd make him
millions of dollars every year...

204
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,470
and chose one that paid
2,000 dollars a month.

205
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:03,039
He even refused international funds.

206
00:15:04,509 --> 00:15:05,639
What could it be?

207
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,309
Why did he make
such an irrational decision?

208
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:12,179
No one knows him from his childhood.

209
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,889
Even now, when he has become
a worldwide star.

210
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,320
We got footage
that confirms his alibi.

211
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:23,159
The news team released
this footage already.

212
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:28,429
They ripped it off.

213
00:15:29,169 --> 00:15:31,470
That means the sender is the killer.

214
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,940
But why?

215
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,039
Why did they risk getting caught?

216
00:15:36,039 --> 00:15:38,409
- They're challenging us.
- They are?

217
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:39,909
It's an ordinary delivery van,

218
00:15:40,009 --> 00:15:41,649
so it's going to take some time
to track it down.

219
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,679
There aren't any CCTV cameras
around this neighborhood.

220
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,519
- Where did that man go?
- I'll bring him in.

221
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,919
What are you doing?

222
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,090
I thought you were done
with your investigation.

223
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,190
Hello, ma'am.

224
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,789
We already explained everything
to your husband.

225
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:55,429
Mr. Park was killed thanks to you.

226
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:58,059
- Get out. Get out right now!
- All right.

227
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:00,200
- Leave!
- We're leaving.

228
00:16:00,299 --> 00:16:01,429
Let's go.

229
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:04,970
Those filthy devils.

230
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:09,570
Gosh, she's still so devout.

231
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:11,980
Tell the forensics
to take the painting.

232
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,309
What about the delivery van?

233
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:14,610
We need as much help as we can get.

234
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:17,009
Should we just let
the RIU take over?

235
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:19,549
They'll take it anyway
since this isn't our jurisdiction.

236
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,019
I saw it.

237
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:26,190
I saw the delivery van.

238
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:32,029
Did you really see it?

239
00:16:33,059 --> 00:16:34,200
What was the license plate number?

240
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,000
I don't know about that.

241
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,600
But I saw the phone number.
It was written this big.

242
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,039
- Really?
- Really?

243
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,539
What was it?

244
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:45,039
Of course, I don't know.
Why would I have memorized that?

245
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,950
What? Then what do you know?

246
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,110
You can find it out...

247
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:52,120
- by scanning my memory.
- What?

248
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:54,720
You shouldn't mess around
with adults.

249
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,320
No. I'll do it.

250
00:16:58,519 --> 00:16:59,690
I have a condition, though.

251
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,929
- A condition?
- I want his number.

252
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,299
- Fine. It's 010...
- Come on. She's talking about me.

253
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,200
I'm talking about yours, Baek.

254
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:10,930
You're the most handsome one here.

255
00:17:11,269 --> 00:17:12,299
"Baek"?

256
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:14,769
- Stay out of this, old man.
- "Old man"?

257
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:18,509
Hey, I'm two years younger than him.

258
00:17:18,509 --> 00:17:20,809
- I may look like this but...
- That's all that you need, right?

259
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,910
- Let's do it my way.
- What do you mean?

260
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:32,890
There's not much.

261
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:39,230
Stop there. That light.

262
00:17:47,099 --> 00:17:48,769
Are those staircase light sensors?

263
00:17:48,869 --> 00:17:51,380
The floor below didn't light up.
Maybe it's broken.

264
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,539
How many times did the lights...

265
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:53,710
on the 3rd and 4th floors turn on
that night?

266
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,609
Let's see... Twice.

267
00:17:57,349 --> 00:17:59,519
At 12am and 4am.

268
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,789
It takes four hours from his house
to the sanctuary.

269
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,250
It's the rooftop.

270
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,859
"The rooftop"?

271
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,589
He left through the rooftop.

272
00:18:20,339 --> 00:18:21,470
Take one for me.

273
00:18:40,259 --> 00:18:41,359
Be quick.

274
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,900
(Daegook Delivery)

275
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,539
He could've gone anywhere
and dodged the cameras.

276
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,680
That is, if he could jump
over there.

277
00:19:31,809 --> 00:19:34,509
Ma'am, I truly hate Baek's guts.

278
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,849
But still, this is unlikely.

279
00:19:36,079 --> 00:19:37,750
He couldn't have jumped
in the middle of the night.

280
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:39,680
One mistake, and he would've died.

281
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:42,220
He abhors murder.

282
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,119
Isn't Occam's Razor
about removing...

283
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,990
anything too complicated?

284
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:48,130
But this is too complex
to even imagine.

285
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,299
We should remove this
assumption first.

286
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,700
- Right.
- Okay.

287
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,529
Hold on.

288
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,599
The witnesses' blood test results
came out.

289
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,970
There were hints of sleeping gas.

290
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,069
If they lost consciousness
due to that gas...

291
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:05,279
That means, it wasn't
because of Baek's superpower.

292
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,579
Does that mean his name is clear?

293
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:12,619
Why do you look so happy?
I thought you hated him.

294
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,289
I wasn't happy.

295
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:17,490
We're still going to suspect him.

296
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,490
- What?
- What?

297
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,789
Ask around.

298
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:21,859
Yes, ma'am.

299
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:31,369
Judging by the MRI,

300
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:34,609
we haven't found any abnormalities
such as edema.

301
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:37,309
In order to determine
why the patient has fainted...

302
00:20:37,309 --> 00:20:39,410
Senior Superintendent Han Sun Mi
has something to tell you.

303
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,710
However, the patient refused it.

304
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:45,349
The patient's vitals and body index
have been stabilized.

305
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,619
I will request that the patient
gets hospitalized...

306
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:49,319
and receives a brain CT scan.

307
00:20:51,289 --> 00:20:53,119
I thought we had finished talking
through the phone.

308
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:55,460
I wanted to meet you.

309
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:57,430
I had a reason to come here as well.

310
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:01,500
Do you know how many there are?

311
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:03,970
Do you know how many doctors
are in charge of Mr. Dong?

312
00:21:05,269 --> 00:21:08,240
- I'm not sure.
- There are 12 medical chiefs...

313
00:21:09,069 --> 00:21:10,970
- That's a lot.
- in the Department of Neurology.

314
00:21:12,009 --> 00:21:13,740
Add all the departments,
and it's 40.

315
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,849
Add the staff members, and it's 400.

316
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:18,519
Add the international team,
and it's 4,000.

317
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,349
That's understandable.

318
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,589
I don't think you get it.

319
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:29,029
Studying Mr. Dong is an honor
and an opportunity for us.

320
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:32,259
- I understand.

as to mention bringing a warrant.

was that they didn't want me
to leave any traces behind.

an anonymous donation or something.

It's slippery here. Be careful.

What are you doing at a crime scene
when Forensics hasn't arrived?

438
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,009
I was performing
a primary investigation...

439
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:50,809
with Det. Dong and Det. Oh.

Constable Oh Se Hoon reporting.

441
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,789
With my smart directing
and strong teamwork,

442
00:31:57,289 --> 00:31:59,019
we were able to find this scene.

443
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:00,289
We were the first to discover her.

444
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:03,059
Get out.
We're restricting the scene.

445
00:32:03,759 --> 00:32:05,059
Of course.

00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:07,599
Just give us the order.
Anything you say we will...

447
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:08,869
It's the same killer
as Park Gi Dan's case.

448
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,140
It's a serial murder case.

449
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:32,789
Did they know each other?

450
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:05,420
The parents who have a hearing
impairment died on the spot.

451
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,990
The young boy didn't last very long
and also passed away.

452
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,230
It was her third time getting caught
for DUI, but she wasn't arrested.

453
00:33:11,329 --> 00:33:13,630
She was in the hospital's VIP room
until she was suspended.

454
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:14,660
Darn it.

455
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,799
How was that possible?

456
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:18,630
They ruled she was temporarily
insane and reached a settlement.

457
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:22,039
The real reason was because
the lawyer used to be a judge.

458
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,609
They are the judge's in-laws.

459
00:33:23,609 --> 00:33:26,809
The problem is, Yeom mocked
the victims after the trial.

460
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:29,609
With a picture of her
opening a bottle of champagne.

461
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,109
What a scumbag.

462
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:34,150
The one who agreed to settle
was their old mother with dementia.

463
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:36,819
The condition can't be better.

464
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:40,220
The lawyer taped it for evidence,
then it went around.

465
00:33:40,619 --> 00:33:42,289
The hospital director received
10,000 dollars,

466
00:33:42,289 --> 00:33:43,990
and the old woman only got
1,000 dollars.

467
00:33:44,089 --> 00:33:45,799
The director even pocketed
the 1,000 dollars.

468
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:48,029
Many announced to murder her
after it went viral on the Internet.

469
00:33:48,259 --> 00:33:50,630
The hospital staff, the judge, and
the prosecutor were threatened too.

470
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,900
Her parents hired a puppet boss
and stepped down,

471
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,640
while Yeom locked herself in
at their villa.

472
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,569
She died after drinking
what she loved the most.

473
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:57,910

this alcohol was poisonous.

suffered a stroke,

for a year.

482
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,099
What witness?

483
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,099
Hey.

484
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:23,400
- Watch it.
- Come on.

485
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,800
The 20 people that were in front
of Park can't remember a thing.

486
00:34:28,039 --> 00:34:29,170
How can there be a witness?

487
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,380
Well? Do you want a tip?

488
00:34:33,309 --> 00:34:34,510
I'm done with being nice to you.

489
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,980
Get out.

490
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,780
You'll regret this.

491
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,230
Could it be a civil militia?

492
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:51,559
"A civil militia"?

493
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,260
Park Gi Dan and Yeom Hwa Ran
both deserved to die.

494
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,369
- There are reasons to murder them.
- Exactly.

495
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,969
They're punishing them
in place of the victims.

496
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,570
Don't be prejudice.
Focus on the crime scene.

497
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,539
- Yes, ma'am.
- Okay.

498
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,590
Can't you talk nicely?

499
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:19,320
She's young,
but she's the senior superintendent.

500
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:21,889
Wait, she's still older than you.

501
00:35:21,889 --> 00:35:24,530
She's as high as our marshal.

502
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,329
- Do you think this is a joke?
- Yes.

503
00:35:26,829 --> 00:35:27,960
You punk...

504
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,769
He's so consistent.

505
00:35:29,769 --> 00:35:32,000
Age, status, and gender
don't matter to him.

506
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:34,170
I'm not telling him to be polite
to respect them.

507
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:37,510
If he can cooperate on this case,
it'll look good during his trial.

508
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:39,780
Cooperate? No way.
We'll catch the criminal.

509
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:41,909
Wait, that's wrong. It'll be me.

510

511
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,780
"Kids"? Don't you know how old I am?

512
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:49,349
That mouth of yours will make
all of your luck run away.

513
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:51,789
What are you researching?

514
00:35:51,789 --> 00:35:53,489
- News articles.
- What news?

515
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,030
The criminal wrote it down
for us to research.

516
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:58,860
There were numbers written
on the newspaper with blood.

517
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,500
Was that published already?

518
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,130
Gosh.

519
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,000
What number? Tell us.

520
00:36:05,269 --> 00:36:07,070
Yeom Hwa Ran read
English newspapers.

521
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:09,610
But beside her body
was a random newspaper.

522
00:36:09,739 --> 00:36:12,809
Why? Because it's bait
the criminal left us.

523
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:34,329
- So?
- It's the publication number.

524
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:36,300
- "Publication number"?
- The number of the newspaper.

525
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,630
Its publication number?

526
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,739
Kyunghan Daily's publication number
is in its 22,000s.

527
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:43,170
Then the year 16,669 was published
was in...

528
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:45,980
That's 6,000 publications
before this one.

529
00:36:46,639 --> 00:36:48,280
That's already 20 years ago.

532
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:57,449
Then what does "19" mean?
This one has "30" on it.

533
00:36:57,449 --> 00:36:59,960
That's the edit number.
It doesn't matter.

534
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,159
- 19 is...
- The page number.

This is crazy.

Both of you are good.

540
00:37:37,929 --> 00:37:41,159
The cause of death
is methanol poisoning.

541
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,500
But we found these in her stomach.
They weigh over 300g.

542
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:45,739
Rocks?

543
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,940
From a glance,
they look like concrete.

544
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,469
Why was she fed these?

545
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:53,440
That's for you to find out.

546
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,150
I'm wondering if concrete...

547
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,480
can accelerate the poisoning
of methanol.

548
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,119
I don't think so.

549
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,449
She was forced to eat these.
It must be a grudge.

550
00:38:03,619 --> 00:38:04,719
They were torturing her.

551
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,699
Ma'am.

552
00:38:16,699 --> 00:38:19,099
You look uncomfortable. Are you...

553
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:25,139
The victim's blood test is out.

554
00:38:25,679 --> 00:38:27,980
The numbers on the newspaper
were in the victim's blood,

555
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:30,150
but the blood sprayed in the room
belongs to a third party.

556
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,010
A third party?
Is it not Park Gi Dan's?

557
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,650
They were sprayed before
Park Gi Dan died.

558
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:36,590
What is this? That means
there are more victims.

You act like a fool, but you have
a brain for random things.

562
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,829
Maybe you have savant syndrome.

563
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,099
What? "Savant"?

564
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:55,199
You know, some mentally disabled
people excel in specific areas.

565

They say Isaac Newton
had savant syndrome too.

You're calling me a rare genius,
right?

567
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:03,679
Too bad you're so strange.

568
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:07,050
You're far from social.

569
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,380
Newton was the same.

570
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:10,250
He ignored everyone else...

571
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:13,059
aside from him
and he always picked fights.

572

It's hard being a genius.

573

We're surrounded
by useless people...

574

who can't see the truth
that's everywhere.

578
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:25,969
"A trap"?

579
00:39:25,969 --> 00:39:28,300
Who left the evidence we're chasing?

580
00:39:28,469 --> 00:39:30,809
The victim? No, it was the murderer.

581
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:33,480
What do you think will be at the end
of this puzzle?

582
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:36,809
Will the murderer sit patiently
while waiting to get arrested?

583
00:39:37,179 --> 00:39:38,480
The witch must be there.

584
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,019
- "Witch"?
- The witch who lures with crumbs.

585

"Hansel and Gretel".

Will we get eaten,
or will the witch get burned?

588

Wait.

589
00:39:52,429 --> 00:39:53,530
There's an interview video.

590
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:55,829
It's in a documentary that aired
when the article was published.

591
00:39:55,829 --> 00:39:57,869
There is absolutely no support
for the victims of a crime.

592
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,070
We must not force them
to overcome their conditions alone.

593
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,809
We must not force them
to overcome their conditions alone.

Professor Nam emphasizes
the necessity of a support system.

595
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:08,679
That means the government
must provide assistance.

596

And what do you think about
this case?

597
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,619
This is a child who lost
her father through a crime.

598
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:18,250
It's a perfect example that shows
that not only the victim...

599
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,590
is affected by a crime.

600
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:21,789
As for children,

601
00:40:21,789 --> 00:40:24,360
They suffer from
severe aftereffects.

602
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,630
This isn't something an individual
can handle on his or her own.

It has been a few years
since he came.

604

You said he can communicate, right?

605
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,880
You can say he has good days
and bad days.

606

so they're making a strange law.

00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:34,969
He likes being called Professor Nam.

642
00:45:37,639 --> 00:45:38,840
Professor Nam.

643
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:41,980
You did an interview 20 years ago.

644
00:45:42,409 --> 00:45:43,550
Do you remember it?

645
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,050
What on earth are we doing?
He wouldn't remember two days ago.

646
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:53,659
Could we get
his children's contact information?

647
00:45:54,789 --> 00:45:56,860
That's personal information.

648
00:45:57,559 --> 00:45:58,760
We're from the police.

649
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:03,199
I'll ask if they're okay with it.

650
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:04,329
Yes, please do.

651
00:46:05,099 --> 00:46:06,969
- Right now?
- Yes, as soon as possible.

652
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,840
This is actually a very important
and urgent case.

653
00:46:14,679 --> 00:46:16,849
Shall we go and check now?

654
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,980
We'll ask him one more time.
Det. Oh, please accompany her.

655
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:21,119
Let's go.

656
00:46:21,849 --> 00:46:23,119
But I have to stay with him...

657
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:24,550
Is it because you have
a rewarding job?

658
00:46:24,550 --> 00:46:25,550
You leave a pleasant impression.

659
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:27,760
If you take a picture
with Det. Dong later...

660
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,030
- to post online, it'll go viral.
- Really?

661
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:31,230
Are you going to read his memories?

662
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,900
- Just keep watch.
- He has Alzheimer’s.

663
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,400
You won't get anything.

664
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:35,860
What if we get caught?

665
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,690
Do you see anything?

666
00:47:06,329 --> 00:47:07,460
The documentary.

667
00:47:12,769 --> 00:47:14,639
Professor Nam.

668
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:20,440
There is absolutely no support
for the victims of a crime.

669
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:25,179
We must not force them
to overcome their conditions alone.

670
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:31,019
Professor Nam emphasizes
the necessity of a support system.

671
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,489
That means the government
must provide assistance.

672
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:40,159
This is a child who lost
her father through a crime.

673
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:43,570
It's a perfect example that shows
that not only the victim...

674
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:45,070
is affected by a crime.

675
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:47,969
- As for children,
- Children...

676
00:47:47,969 --> 00:47:50,110
They suffer from
severe aftereffects.

677
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:51,610
Severe...

678
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:54,179
This isn't something an individual
can handle on his or her own.

679
00:47:58,579 --> 00:48:00,750
We're setting up the cameras
right now.

680
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,989
We'll begin as soon as we're ready.

681
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,920
This is a child who lost
her father through a crime.

682
00:48:06,389 --> 00:48:08,619
It's a perfect example that shows
that not only the victim...

683
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:10,130
is affected by a crime.

684
00:48:15,429 --> 00:48:16,730
No!

685
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,170
I'm not finished drawing it...

686
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:43,630
- Did you see something?
- A drawing.

687
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,789
I saw a sketch
from the murder scene.

688
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,929
Where?

689
00:48:47,929 --> 00:48:49,869
The girl in the documentary
drew the same drawing.

690
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:53,469
- Do you mean this?
- The edges look similar.

691
00:48:53,769 --> 00:48:55,269
All the sketches
from the murder scene...

692
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:57,010
were drawn within
the outlines.

693
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:59,880
And that girl drew the same thing.

694
00:49:02,610 --> 00:49:03,750
It's the shape of a vase.

695
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:06,579
That girl from 20 years ago
is the murderer?

696
00:49:07,849 --> 00:49:11,750
- I don't know what's happening...
- I saw something horrible.

697
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:15,019
So Mi...

698
00:49:17,230 --> 00:49:20,530
- Who?
- Kim So Mi.

699
00:49:22,699 --> 00:49:25,929
She was there
when her father was murdered.

700
00:49:25,929 --> 00:49:27,139
What happened to her?

701
00:49:27,570 --> 00:49:30,070
When her panic attacks recurred,

702
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:32,909
she trembled severely...

703
00:49:33,739 --> 00:49:36,380
and repeated the same prayer.

704
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:38,309
Prayer?

705
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:40,679
The prayer of...

706
00:49:41,679 --> 00:49:42,780
the guardian angel.

707
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:45,190
Guardian angel?

708
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:51,590
"The holy guardian angel..."

709
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,469
"who always protects me."

710
00:49:57,329 --> 00:49:58,699
"The Lord..."

711
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,440
- "has sent you to me."
- "has sent you to me."

712
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,980
Please protect my body
from the blade of evil...

713
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:10,780
and lead me out of
the deep darkness with your light...

714
00:50:10,809 --> 00:50:13,010
and lead me to goodness.

715
00:50:13,650 --> 00:50:14,880
Amen!

716
00:50:25,030 --> 00:50:26,130
Let's go.

717
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,500
- His family isn't answering yet...
- We're done investigating.

718
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:29,630
Thank you for your cooperation.

719
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,269
Thank you. Goodbye.

720
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:34,170
Can I take a picture?

721
00:50:35,539 --> 00:50:37,110
Why aren't they coming back out?

722
00:50:40,179 --> 00:50:42,280
There they are. Hey.

723
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:43,550
Lean back!

724
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:48,250
I got it.

725
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,190
A girl named Kim So Mi was
adopted to the US...

726
00:50:50,190 --> 00:50:51,420
after her father was murdered.

727
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,760
- What else?
- It happened so long ago,

728
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:55,619
and there's only basic information
on our database.

729
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,130
We need to search the case file
for more.

730
00:50:57,130 --> 00:50:58,289
Doesn't Seoul Metropolitan
Police Agency...

731
00:50:58,289 --> 00:50:59,429
store files for cold cases?

732
00:50:59,429 --> 00:51:00,929
Let's go to the RIU for now.
Give me the key.

733
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:03,599
You have the key.
You were the one who drove...

734
00:51:06,599 --> 00:51:07,739
When did I get this?

735
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:21,679
What is it?

736
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:29,159
A keyhole.

737
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:32,190
- What hole?
- The outline of the vase...

738
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,159
was a keyhole.

739
00:51:34,699 --> 00:51:35,900
What are you talking about?

740
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:38,900
She saw her dad die
through a keyhole.

741
00:51:47,340 --> 00:51:49,510
- I saw that keyhole too.
- Where?

742
00:51:51,909 --> 00:51:55,079
I'm not sure. It was from
someone's memory that I read.

743
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,619
Who was that?

744
00:51:58,250 --> 00:51:59,989
Take him and go to the RIU.

745
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:02,860
- Hey, tell us who it is at least!
- Later.

746
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:05,530
Where are you going at this time
without even a car?

747
00:52:05,530 --> 00:52:06,630
I have a car!

748
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,269
He always leaves the important parts
out. How frustrating.

749
00:52:11,570 --> 00:52:14,269
I'll follow him, so you go inside
and find out what they were doing.

750
00:52:14,269 --> 00:52:16,300
- Return when you're finished.
- Sir, but...

751
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,010
- You have to be discreet...
- No, it's not that.

752
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:20,239
Hey, hey!

753
00:52:20,809 --> 00:52:22,440
Hey, you punk!

754
00:52:23,010 --> 00:52:24,909
- Open the door!
- Hey!

755
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:26,820
Stop, you little punk!

756
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:28,150
Stop!

757
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:33,960
Please answer the phone.

758
00:52:45,269 --> 00:52:47,400
(Detective Dong Baek)

759
00:52:53,340 --> 00:52:54,340
(Detective Dong Baek)

760
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:02,679
The receiver cannot be reached.
You will be directed to voicemail...

761
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,079
Yes, ma'am?

762
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:38,280
Send armed backup to
Yeom Hwa Ran's villa now.

763
00:55:15,349 --> 00:55:17,090
This is Lee Seul Bi
from the situation room.

764
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:19,050
I'm Det. Dong Baek.
Where is Senior Superintendent Han?

765
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:20,320
Senior Superintendent Han?

766
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,989
Find out her location.
She's in danger.

767
00:55:21,989 --> 00:55:24,260
She's at the crime scene.
Yeom Hwa Ran's villa

768
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:25,590
What? Darn.

769
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,300
She found a lead on the suspect
and went there alone.

770
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,570
Send backup now.

771
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:31,900
I already sent a request...

772
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:34,340
but the closest division
is 15 minutes away...

773
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:36,340
Send everyone now! It's a trap!

774
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:38,309
A trap?

775
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:42,010
The owner who moved in
suffered a stroke,

776
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:43,650
so this place has been vacant
for over a year.

777
00:55:57,730 --> 00:55:59,989
Darn it.
How could she be so ignorant?

778
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:01,829
That place is a trap.

779
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:17,530
It's a body.

780
00:58:31,579 --> 00:58:34,150
The holy guardian angel,
who always protects me.

781
00:58:37,219 --> 00:58:38,719
The Lord...

782
00:58:38,889 --> 00:58:41,090
- has sent you to me.
- has sent you to me.

783
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:44,659
Please protect my body
from the blade of evil...

784
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,900
and lead me out of
the deep darkness...

785
00:58:46,900 --> 00:58:49,230
- with your light.
- with your light.

786
00:58:49,699 --> 00:58:51,699
- Amen.
- Amen.

787
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:53,369
Amen!

788
00:59:31,369 --> 00:59:34,010
Do you know about the
Teenage Girls Double Jeopardy Case?

789
00:59:34,010 --> 00:59:36,639
It's a case where a girl from
an orphanage died six years ago.

790
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:38,710
The culprits turned out to be
girls in middle school.

791
00:59:38,849 --> 00:59:40,050
Murder by an executor.

792
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,349
Punishing the devil
by using an evil method?

793
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:45,150
The exact same method
is being repeated.

794
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:47,159
The same pattern from 20 years ago.

795
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:49,489
There are no records at all
at the Special Investigation Team?

796
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:50,860
The one in charge of
the investigation was...

797
00:59:51,889 --> 00:59:53,590
- What?
- It's probably someone close.

798
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:54,730
Someone way up the ladder.

799
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:55,760
It's someone close.

800
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,300
It's him.
