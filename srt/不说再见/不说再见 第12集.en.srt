00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,229
Who told you to come?

4
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:39,870
Glasses wants me to tell you

5
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,820
that you should know what to do.

6
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:45,900
What do you mean?

7
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,130
Six words.

8
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,580
"Make the decision when it's time."

9
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,000
Go back and ask Glasses

10
00:01:58,789 --> 00:02:00,240
to tell Mr. Ou...

11
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,530
I'm here to deliver the message,

12
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,070
not to help you pass on a message.

13
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,330
That's impossible.

14
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:09,970
Mr. Ou would never abandon me.

15
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:12,650
Tell him to tell Mr. Ou this.

16
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,880
I know what to do.

17
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:14,900
I'm sorry.

18
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,660
Let me emphasize this again.

19
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,329
I'm here to deliver a message,

20
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,520
not to pass on your message.

21
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,860
Besides, I have no idea who Mr. Ou is.

22
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,360
That's all.

25
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,420
What else did he say?

26
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,620
I've told you everything.

27
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,250
Dakun didn't say anything else.

28
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,460
You're dismissed.

29
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,770
Sir.

30
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:05,760
Are we really going to let Dakun...

31
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,690
He's a threat to us now.

32
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,810
We need to take the bull by the horns.

33
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,710
Make the arrangements.

34
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,560
Make it quick.

35
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,770
After all, we're friends
who have fought together for so long.

36
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,650
Mr. Glasses.

37
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,640
Is everyone here?

38
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,440
Yes. They're waiting for you.

39
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,880
It's not that I'm scared.

40
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,020
Dakun...

41
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,470
Right now,

42
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,420
he's being investigated all of a sudden.

43
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,220
Let me give you some advice.

44
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,560
Please be careful.

45
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,890
Don't panic.

46
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,920
The police are only after Dakun.

47
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,459
Just get to the point.

48
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:21,880
You asked us here in a hurry.

49
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:24,430
I'm sure it's not just for drinks.

50
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,630
I asked both of you here

51
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,220
to talk about Dakun.

52
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,630
What's there to talk about?

53
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,740
I'm sure that Dakun isn't the mole.

54
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,110
If he were,

55
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,470
the three of us, including Mr. Ou

56
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,970
would have been screwed long ago.

57
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,260
Tell me, Mr. Glasses.

58
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,930
Did someone stab us in the back?

59
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:42,690
If it was Mu Qing,

60
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,100
I would be the first to kill him.

61
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,180
Whether or not someone set him up,

62
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,640
we'll know in the future.

63
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,490
But this time,

64
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,909
things are looking grim for Dakun.

65
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,490
What do you mean?

66
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,120
Mr. Ou hasn't said anything yet.

67
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,720
But what I'm trying to say is that

68
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:12,650
Dakun has hundreds of dealers.

69
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,720
He is the biggest source of funds

70
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:15,950
for our company.

71
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,620
Now that he's in trouble,

72
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,650
we've lost a big source of funds.

73
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:22,150
If we do nothing to recover from that,

74
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,440
we're the ones who will suffer the most.

75
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:26,250
No. Wait a minute.

76
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,430
Mr. Glasses.

77
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,020
We're not done talking about the mole.

78
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,470
Why are you talking about this now?

79
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,230
I don't care about anything else.

80
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:35,220
I'm here to find the traitor.

81
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,480
I'm not interested in anything else.

82
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:41,909
What about you?

83
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,110
Without Dakun,

84
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,090
no one will help us distribute the goods.

85
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,909
I don't mind keeping the goods.

86
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:51,190
I'm afraid Mr. Ou will blame us.

87
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:53,750
We'll have to suffer then.

88
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,830
That's also what I'm worried about.

89
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,420
What do you think?

90
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,180
What do I think?

91
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,120
Find someone to take over.

92
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,300
Who do you think is right for the job?

93
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,700
Who do I think is right for the job?

94
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,130
If you really didn't have anyone in mind,

95
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,250
you wouldn't have asked us here.

96
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,620
Since you already have someone in mind,

97
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,470
why bother asking us?

98
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:28,240
That's my own opinion.

99
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:31,670
Mr. Ou wants to hear what you two think.

100
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,920
Mr. Ou?

101
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:36,420
If this was Mr. Ou's idea,

102
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,920
Li Ruosheng and Mu Qing

103
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,280
should be here too.

104
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,780
Wait a minute.

105
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,890
Those two are nobody.

106
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,650
Why should they be here?

107
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:47,600
Let's not comment on that just yet.

108
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,150
Mu Qing is not much younger than you.

109
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,310
If Mr. Feng hadn't been arrested

110
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,450
by the police back then,

111
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,390
I'm afraid

112
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,880
you wouldn't be in this position.

113
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,200
How could you talk like that?

114
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,570
How is this appropriate?

115
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:02,520
I, Congtou, could come this far

116
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,110
all because of my hard work!

117
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,520
I didn't take advantage of anyone!

118
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,480
Unlike someone else

119
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,810
who relied on her man
to get to where she is.

120
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,090
What's wrong?

121
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,890
Your man is in jail now.

122
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,050
At this moment,

123
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,120
you're the one who should be worried.

124
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,080
Darn you!

125
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,270
Darn you.

126
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,030
Stop it.

127
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,460
Mr. Glasses.

128
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,220
Mu Qing and Li Ruosheng are here.

129
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,950
Guanyin, Congtou.

130
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,450
What's going on?

131
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,810
I could hear you from below.

132
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:37,280
Mr. Glasses.

133
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,140
Have you been too busy

134
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,590
that you forgot to inform us?

135
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:43,350
It's not me.

136
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,720
Both of you were too busy.

137
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,630
We're only here to have a chat.

138
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,080
So we didn't want to bother you.

139
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,760
Mr. Glasses.

140
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,180
We can still make time for a drink.

141
00:07:57,650 --> 00:07:58,880
I'll cut to the chase.

142
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,170
To whom is Mr. Ou planning

143
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,060
to give Dakun's turf?

144
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,610
You should ask him that.

145
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,890
Why are you asking me?

146
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,600
Besides,

147
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,250
something is fishy with Dakun's arrest.

148
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,540
Mr. Ou and I have been investigating this.

149
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,790
Until we find out the truth,

150
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,250
no one should make a move.

151
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:24,710
That means

152
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,950
there's no getting out of this
for the two of us.

153
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,800
No one is getting out of this.

154
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,390
All right.

155
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,110
Before we get to the bottom of things,

156
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,650
no one should make a move.

157
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,940
Why do you care if I do?

158
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,870
What were you doing

159
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,340
when we were out risking life
and limb with Mr. Ou?

160
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,799
Judging from what you said,

161
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,050
you want to get the turf.

162
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,410
Say it one more time.

163
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,540
I think he's right.

164
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:55,810
Not only do we need

165
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,220
to investigate Dakun's situation,

166
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,450
but we also need

167
00:08:58,540 --> 00:08:59,600
to get to the bottom of it.

168
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,180
Otherwise, we won't be able

169
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,770
to answer to our men.

170
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,010
As for the rest,

171
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:07,520
it's not too late to talk about it

172
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,750
after everything is over.

173
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,200
What do you say?

174
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,050
Guanyin is right.

175
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,220
Everyone.

176
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:22,920
Before Mr. Ou says anything,

177
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,540
none of us

178
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:26,830
get to have a say.

179
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:28,810
All right.

180
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,310
Let's just wait

181
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,510
and see what Mr. Ou says.

182
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,960
Tell me.

183
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,720
What should we do next?

184
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,670
We've offended Mr. Glasses today.

185
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,870
He is the closest person to Godfather.

186
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,120
There'll be nothing good for us
from now on.

187
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,280
Good?

188
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,010
When have we had anything good from them?

189
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,460
If Mr. Glasses wanted

190
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,860
to just work with Mr. Ou,

191
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,620
why did he only

192
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,260
ask Congtou and Guanyin out?

193
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,620
So you think Mr. Glasses
has other plans in mind?

194
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,170
Will he do something to harm Godfather?

195
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,940
What do you think?

196
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,750
I think...

197
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,470
Where are you going?

198
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,660
Let's talk somewhere else.

199
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,620
Come on. We haven't finished talking.

200
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:47,530
Look how Mu Qing talked to Glasses.

201
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:48,930
What do you think

202
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,520
he has on his mind?

203
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:53,600
Mu Qing was trying

204
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:55,400
to make a show of strength.

205
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,870
It's a deliberate act

206
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:03,150
as a warning to Glasses.

207
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,910
Are you saying

208
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,930
that Glasses is eyeing on Dakun's turf?

209
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,100
Isn't it obvious?

210
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,520
Now that Dakun is in trouble,

211
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,550
someone has to take over his business.

212
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,790
Am I right?

213
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:32,760
But Mr. Ou didn't ask us.

214
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,590
Instead, Glasses beat him to it.

215
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:38,300
Mr. Glasses has been with Mr. Ou

216
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:39,450
for so many years.

217
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:41,160
So many people tried to butter him up.

218
00:11:41,690 --> 00:11:43,360
As long as Congtou and Guanyin

219
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:44,770
don't object to it,

220
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:48,900
Dakun's turf will go to Mr. Glasses then.

221
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,630
But he didn't expect us

222
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,300
to show up out of nowhere.

223
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,020
What can we do?

224
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,920
You were drooling

225
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,420
all over Dakun's turf.

226
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,030
Drooling is one thing.

227
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,490
Do you think we can handle
such a huge plate?

228
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,130
This means a head-on fight
against Glasses.

229
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,800
Are you scared now?

230
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,050
No.

231
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,000
Glasses and Dakun are different.

232
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:16,930
A real schemer.

233
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,090
No one knows what's on his mind.

234
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,450
Glasses thought

235
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,060
that things were that simple.

236
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,420
It's not about what we both think.

237
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,440
It's about

238
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,710
what Mu Qing and Li Ruosheng think.

239
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,020
I don't know what he thinks.

240
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,230
But the last thing
Mr. Glasses wants to see

241
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,340
is the two of us getting a slice of this.

242
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,620
That's right.

243
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,640
We're outsiders after all.

244
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,520
But it's all up to Mr. Ou

245
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,320
as to who will get this turf.

246
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:56,270
Dakun's turf is only this big.

247
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,460
But I didn't expect it

248
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,860
to involve so many things.

249
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,110
If you ask me,

250
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:03,660
it's not Glasses who thought
things were that simple.

251
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,170
It's you guys

252
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,150
who complicated things.

253
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,230
The stage

254
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,380
is ready.

255
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,900
It's all up to us

256
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:18,490
how we're going to run the show.

257
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,550
Let's watch the fight from the sideline.

258
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,180
When they are all exhausted,

259
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,380
we'll make our entrance

260
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,800
and reap the spoils.

261
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,410
Perhaps, Glasses will be

262
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,130
right in front to take the heat.

263
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,990
That way, Dakun's turf

264
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,190
will come to us

265
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:38,810
as easy as blowing off dust.

266
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:43,300
Mr. Ou is undecided

267
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,770
because the person he has in mind

268
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:47,970
isn't among the Four Vajras.

269
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,870
So that leaves just the two of us, right?

270
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:51,970
Yes.

271
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:53,860
That's one of our strengths.

272
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,650
But even that

273
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,830
is nothing as compared

274
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,510
to the Four Vajras's aptitudes.

275
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,050
But...

276
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,510
let me remind you.

277
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:08,910
It doesn't matter who Glasses assigns

278
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,020
to take over Dakun's business.

279
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,490
We'll both get our shares.

280
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,980
Don't forget

281
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,740
that I was the one who reminded you.

282
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,270
Okay.

283
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,050
I'll do as you say.

284
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,000
But I want to emphasize this.

285
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,680
No matter what Glasses is up to,

286
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,030
it has nothing to do with me.

287
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,360
Really?

288
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:44,590
Yes.

289
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,570
Look at me.

290
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:50,050
Just like the boats

291
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,120
and the birds in the sea.

292
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,670
I was born to be on the move

293
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,160
and fly around tirelessly.

294
00:14:56,870 --> 00:14:58,410
This is going to be tough.

295
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,000
In order to make Mr. Ou trust us

296
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,510
and give us Dakun's turf,

297
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,720
we have to give Mr. Ou a good reason

298
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:08,000
to convince the others.

299
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,660
What's your plan?

300
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:24,370
Why don't I hear anything?

301
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,260
It has only been three months.

302
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:27,670
Of course you can't hear anything.

303
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,090
It seems like

304
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,330
I'm too anxious, aren't I?

305
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,370
Tell me.

306
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:38,180
What shall we name our son?

307
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,770
Why is it a son?

308
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,830
We don't even know
if it's a boy or a girl.

309
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,270
I'll walk with you.

310
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:51,780
Congtou.

311
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,290
Don't you think

312
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,970
you spend too little time with me?

313
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,610
Days of us

314
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,190
walking hands in hands like this

315
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,780
are so hard to come by.

316
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,230
Wait. What's wrong?

317
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:09,820
Call it quits.

318
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:14,830
There's not a day

319
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,240
that I can sleep in peace

320
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,060
for all this time that I've been with you.

321
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:21,960
I'm worried that when my baby is born,

322
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,940
I won't even know where his dad is.

323
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:28,030
Look, we're out taking a stroll.

324
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,630
There are so many people
standing in the yard.

325
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,960
Is this normal?

326
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,480
Get lost!

327
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,040
What exactly is a happy life?

328
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:44,670
I want nothing.

329
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,690
I just want you to be safe

330
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,100
and be with me.

331
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,510
Okay.

332
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:12,560
I promise.

333
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:17,490
I'll quit.

334
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,270
Are you clear?

335
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:22,460
Yes!

336
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:23,910
Go.

337
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,920
Yes!

338
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,370
Jeez.

339
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,000
Is it going to work?

340
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,120
Let's take our chance.

341
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,280
-Come here.
-Here, drink up.

342
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:41,250
Cheers.

343
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,420
What are you doing?

344
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,440
How do we explain to Godfather?

345
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,990
It has come to this,
what's the point of worrying about it?

346
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,630
Think about it.

347
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,180
How did Dakun steal your turf?

348
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,500
That's enough.

349
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,170
From now on,

350
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,240
Mr. Mu will get 20% of the sales of drugs

351
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:07,960
in Jinhua Street.

352
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,540
Got it?

353
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,550
Yes.

354
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,560
Beat them up!

355
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,640
The reason we make a surprise move

356
00:18:14,950 --> 00:18:17,060
is to make a show of strength
to Dakun's men

357
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,580
and gain a foothold with Mr. Ou.

358
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,940
Ruosheng.

359
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,490
Sometimes, when opportunities come,

360
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,030
you need to make a move.

361
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,620
Come on.

362
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,910
This is Mr. Li and Mr. Mu's turf
from now on!

363
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,360
Is that clear?

364
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:39,770
Yes.

365
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,570
That's more like it.

366
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,710
Spread the word!

367
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:47,290
Do you hear me?

368
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,840
Hello?

369
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,630
Good job. Keep it up.

370
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,820
I think we need to talk about this.

371
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,070
If Godfather questions us,

372
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,050
we should have an explanation.

373
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:20,860
If your godfather calls,

374
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,060
we have no choice but to admit defeat.

375
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:26,410
All right. Don't worry.

376
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,250
I have a feeling.

377
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:31,160
Your godfather won't call you.

378
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,700
Hello?

379
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:41,500
That's great.

380
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,410
Look.

381
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,610
Hey, it's me.

382
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:10,670
What?

383
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:17,050
When was that?

384
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,680
Earlier tonight,

385
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:21,490
Mu Qing and Li Ruosheng's men

386
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:23,910
beat up all the dealers on Jinhua Street.

387
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:28,880
That's a bold move.

388
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,140
That's an act of insubordination.

389
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,870
Jinhua Street is part of Dakun's turf.

390
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:36,450
Pulling such a stunt

391
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:39,840
means they have no respect for you.

392
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,690
Glasses.

393
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,080
Didn't I tell you?

394
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:49,650
Jinhua Street isn't Dakun's

395
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,250
nor anyone's turf.

396
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,270
It's mine.

397
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,190
Yes.

398
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,660
But what Mu Qing did...

399
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,110
-I...
-There's no rush.

400
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,850
I'd like to see

401
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,680
what those two brats are up to.

402
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,340
[Those two have made a move.]

403
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:13,470
Is there any news?

404
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,540
Look, Godfather already knew about it.

405
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,260
But he didn't even ask.

406
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,840
What does that mean?

407
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:25,480
That means

408
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,980
we did the right thing.

409
00:22:29,130 --> 00:22:30,190
Mu Qing.

410
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:31,950
I really should go to the beach

411
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,310
and set up a table for you.

412
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,070
I'll put a Bagua
and a bowl of water on it.

413
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,440
You can just be a fortune teller.

414
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,550
Why do you seem to know everything?

415
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,580
I'm telling you.

416
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,040
That's not all I know.

417
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,440
I also know

418
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,510
that someone is getting restless.

419
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,580
Who is it?

420
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:50,470
That would be me.

421
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,880
Are you out of your mind?

422
00:22:58,520 --> 00:22:59,450
Ruosheng.

423
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,350
The breakfast you make
isn't as good as before.

424
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,290
There's no love in it.

425
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,140
Can't you see I have a lot on my mind?

426
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,720
It's good enough there's food to eat.

427
00:23:07,850 --> 00:23:09,920
What do you expect? Who does a better job?

428
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,370
Does Kexin do it better?

429
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,780
Ask her to make it for you then.

430
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,380
You're just so fussy.

431
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,070
Should I applaud you

432
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,010
or should I set a table for you

433
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,810
and call for a celebration?

434
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,190
Look, Mu Qing.

435
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,050
You've got some nerve.

436
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,160
Aren't you afraid

437
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,830
that Mr. Ou will hold you to account?

438
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,290
Congtou.

439
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:47,100
I had no choice.

440
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:48,810
Otherwise,

441
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,370
who would dare to mess with Dakun's stuff?

442
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,690
My good little brother.

443
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,710
You and Li Ruosheng

444
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,570
are now the rising stars for Mr. Ou.

445
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:03,470
Who would dare to force you?

446
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:07,510
Congtou.

447
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,190
Even if I have the nerves,

448
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,030
I wouldn't dare to act disrespectfully.

449
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,280
If anything happens,

450
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,860
you have to help me.

451
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:17,900
What is it?

452
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,710
Tell me. I'll surely have your back.

453
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:25,250
After we left the ship the other day,

454
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:27,230
Guanyin had a word with me in private.

455
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,440
She insisted that I do this

456
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,330
not for anything else,

457
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:34,620
but to put on an act for you.

458
00:24:38,530 --> 00:24:39,630
Guanyin?

459
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:41,880
That's not possible.

460
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,160
How could she possibly do this?

461
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,510
You should know the situation

462
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,650
between Guanyin and Dakun.

463
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,780
Who wants Dakun's turf the most?

464
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,800
Congtou.

465
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,360
Li Ruosheng and I just made a comeback.

466
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,690
As for Dakun's turf,

467
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:03,740
we were just saying it.

468
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,800
We couldn't afford it.

469
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:10,430
But if Guanyin backs us up

470
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,100
and lends us a hand,

471
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:14,610
the situation will be different.

472
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,410
Congtou.

473
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,610
Our hands are tied.

474
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,980
I'm really sorry.

475
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:30,850
I'll get going then.

476
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,690
It's a good wine.

477
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:59,400
Try it.

478
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,230
I'm afraid

479
00:26:03,850 --> 00:26:05,430
you're not here for a drink.

480
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:08,160
Do I look drunk?

481
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:15,290
But indeed,

482
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,710
I'm not here for a drink.

483
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:22,590
So you know?

484
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,910
Yes.

485
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,420
Not only do I know what you did,

486
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,840
but I also know

487
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:37,290
that Congtou just met you earlier.

488
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:41,160
Guanyin.

489
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:43,140
I didn't have a choice.

490
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,680
This was all Congtou's idea.

491
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:46,700
I know. You don't have to explain.

492
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,170
But let me remind you.

493
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,500
Whatever he offers you,

494
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:53,170
I can give you the same

495
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,550
and even more.

496
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,790
I know very well

497
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:00,470
that you want to get a promotion
through this.

498
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,720
Sure, no problem.

499
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,670
If I get this turf,

500
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,490
I'll let you handle

501
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,900
the reconstruction and management.

502
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,410
How about that? Does it sound good?

503
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,180
Also,

504
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,090
who's Congtou?

505
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:27,310
He's just a raw material supplier.

506
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:29,860
Then...

507
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,550
Who and where

508
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,610
the source of the business is?

509
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,640
It's me.

510
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:45,620
Guanyin.

511
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:47,330
I know that.

512
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,500
But I gave Congtou my word.

513
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:51,910
I can't cross him.

514
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,890
Aren't you afraid of crossing me then?

515
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,360
That's not what I meant.

516
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,900
So it's a no?

517
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,490
If I agree,

518
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,820
I will have to give Congtou a reason.

519
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,890
Guanyin.

520
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,560
Indeed, I'm interested

521
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,100
in reconstruction and management.

522
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,780
That's all that matters.

523
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,180
Cheers.

524
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:18,260
Here.

525
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:30,450
Guanyin.

526
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,080
I'll get going then.

527
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,460
It's delicious.

528
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,310
I'll get going then.

529
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,340
Ms. Guanyin.

530
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:03,710
Contact Zhang and the others at once.

531
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,230
I need their help
first thing in the morning tomorrow.

532
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,130
That's right.

533
00:29:09,210 --> 00:29:10,090
Wang Meng.

534
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,910
Look, when have I ever

535
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,980
go back against my word?

536
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,690
All right. Sure.

537
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:18,810
Tomorrow morning.

538
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,010
I'm counting on you, okay?

539
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,780
Sure. Okay.

540
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,270
Mr. Congtou, I've found something.

541
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:33,190
Zhang, Wang Meng, and Lu.

542
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:35,570
Not bad, you witch, Tieguanyin.

543
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,590
Keep a close eye on her.

544
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,790
Let me know as soon as you find anything.

545
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:40,810
-Got it?
-Yes.

546
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,830
Wait.

547
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:50,970
Look.

548
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,080
Did I wake you up?

549
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:55,850
Congtou.

550
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,020
Don't forget what you promised me.

551
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,710
Look, you did this

552
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,160
simply to spark conflict

553
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,880
between Tieguanyin and Congtou?

554
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,310
Play both ends against the middle.

555
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,280
In the end,

556
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,080
we're still needed for the finale.

557
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,020
Both of us?

558
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:24,630
She has over a dozen big clients.

559
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:27,180
We don't stand a chance.

560
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:29,200
Don't worry.

561
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,010
The best is yet to come.

562
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,300
Sir.

563
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,140
The morale of our men

564
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,430
is greatly undermined
because of Dakun's situation.

565
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:51,030
The work at the company
is delayed as well.

566
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,450
So it would be great

567
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,740
if you could find a replacement

568
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,360
to take over Dakun's place.

569
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,080
It won't do us any good

570
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,800
if we drag this on.

571
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,340
The leaf has turned yellow.

572
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,310
Just cut it off.

573
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,730
One needs to be patient

574
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:19,140
to wait for the new leaf to grow.

575
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,570
But Dakun’s business

576
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:23,850
is directly related

577
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,390
to the source of funds of our group.

578
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:29,260
If the leaves are gone, they'll grow back.

579
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,420
But if the stem is broken,

580
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,740
that will be bad.

581
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,960
You seem more worried than I am.

582
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:41,270
I've been with you for so long.

583
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,330
But still,

584
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:45,540
I failed to learn the best of you.

585
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,040
Tell me what you think.

586
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:48,400
I wouldn't dare.

587
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:51,170
Well, about all this,

588
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,670
it's best if you decide, sir.

589
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,870
It's okay. Try and say it.

590
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:56,410
I wouldn't dare.

591
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,260
Sir.

592
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,750
I'm with you all the time.

593
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,780
All I know is your emotions

594
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:03,930
and well-being.

595
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,960
I know nothing about the outside world.

596
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:08,030
I dare not make things up.

597
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,160
Glasses.

598
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,980
I'm worried about the business too.

599
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,010
But I'd rather be a willing victim

600
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,910
who let myself get caught
against my own will.

601
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:23,030
Nothing forcibly done
is going to be agreeable, right?

602
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:24,040
Yes.

603
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,580
I guess

604
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,090
the person who wants

605
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,450
to take over Dakun's business

606
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,990
will show up soon.

607
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,620
Hello, Lu.

608
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:41,330
Why the sudden phone call?

609
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,580
You never once called me

610
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,760
in the past half a year.

611
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,460
Is that so?

612
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:51,280
I didn't know Congtou is so thoughtful.

613
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,730
Okay.

614
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,440
I'll tell him to keep up the good work.

615
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:56,860
All right.

616
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,050
I know.

617
00:32:58,760 --> 00:32:59,680
Okay. That's all then.

618
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:03,460
What did I say?

619
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,000
These important clients

620
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,720
have started
recommending candidates to me.

621
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,300
You're right.

622
00:33:15,700 --> 00:33:17,060
This time, it's Tieguanyin.

623
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,500
This woman is a PR expert.

624
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,100
A few big clients are taking her side.

625
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,130
They all spoke highly of her.

626
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,760
Even as her boss,

627
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,870
these flattering remarks
are giving me goose bumps.

628
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:37,390
Tell me.

629
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,900
Do you think Tieguanyin has bribed them?

630
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:50,190
Judging from the situation,

631
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,890
those who want
to take over Dakun's business

632
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:56,660
and should already be on their way.

633
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:59,870
Mr. Ou, Congtou is here.

634
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,260
What did I say?

635
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,070
Sir.

636
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,530
I have recorded

637
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,889
all the expenses incurred

638
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,699
in the past few months

639
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,840
in this notebook in detail.

640
00:34:15,969 --> 00:34:17,159
Please take a look.

641
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:19,190
But I've also made

642
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,860
some unnecessary expenses

643
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:22,880
where I should cut back spending
wherever possible

644
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:25,260
and used them to maintain

645
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,580
good customer relationships.

646
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,429
Mr. Glasses knows about it.

647
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,139
Logically speaking,

648
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,300
Dakun should have given me
the money in advance.

649
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:33,659
But now,

650
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:37,010
it's an exceptional case, right?

651
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,560
So I took the liberty

652
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,760
and spent all the money.

653
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,690
I don't know if I did the right thing.

654
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,449
Mr. Ou, please take a look.

655
00:34:48,050 --> 00:34:50,690
Just let Glasses go through it will do.

656
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:53,020
Okay.

657
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,000
Here, Mr. Glasses.

658
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,780
I'll cut to the chase then.

659
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,370
You're here today

660
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:06,090
because you have an ax to grind.

661
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,990
Sir, what are you talking about?

662
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,400
Don't say that.

663
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:12,560
You're here for Dakun's turf.

664
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,180
Sir.

665
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:20,080
I know my place.

666
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,490
But I believe

667
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,120
that if you give me a chance,

668
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,620
I'll surely do my best to get things done.

669
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,470
In the past few years,

670
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:29,010
I've been doing my best

671
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,820
to expand my network.

672
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,470
But I'm still far behind Dakun,

673
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,110
and it's indeed pretty obvious.

674
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,260
That means it's barely enough.

675
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:43,400
You could say that.

676
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,200
But if you give me a chance,

677
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:46,480
I'll surely do my best.

678
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,420
I'm pretty confident myself.

679
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:56,420
Everyone is here.

680
00:35:58,840 --> 00:35:59,900
Greetings, sir.

681
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,890
I'm here to visit you.

682
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:07,690
That's not why you're here.

683
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:09,670
You're here to find out

684
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,940
who gets Dakun's turf.

685
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,440
What are you talking about?

686
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:15,480
I came here because I missed you.

687
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,070
But I heard

688
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,710
that Congtou is ahead of everyone else.

689
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:22,820
I'm sure it's his then.

690
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,660
Guanyin.

691
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,290
What are you talking about?

692
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:32,410
Even if I'm fast, I'm no match for you.

693
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:35,580
Sir, look how she talks in front of you.

694
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:36,860
You be the judge.

695
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:38,400
What for?

696
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,950
Go on, I'll listen.

697
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:43,500
I have nothing to say.

698
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:47,640
Just say what's on your mind.

699
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,830
Go on.

700
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,230
Congtou, Guanyin.

701
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,390
That's quite an intense discussion

702
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,580
you two are having.

703
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:56,920
Godfather, Mr. Glasses.

704
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,330
We were waiting for you two.

705
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,030
Come on. Follow me.

706
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:11,930
Congtou.

707
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,250
Come on.

708
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,640
Pick one.

709
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:36,390
What's wrong?

710
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:38,680
Weren't you all excited earlier?

711
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,390
Why are you so quiet now?

712
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,590
Look, Mr. Ou.

713
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:43,910
This...

714
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,670
This is not right.

715
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:49,900
There were dozens of calls and messages.

716
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,830
Guanyin, Congtou.

717
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:53,900
You two are like He Xiangu and Cao Guojiu.

718
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:55,260
You have such great connections.

719
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,990
Are you trying to force my hand?

720
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,270
Sir.

721
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,980
Don't scare me.

722
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,490
I wouldn't dare.

723
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,220
Mr. Ou.

724
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,770
We don't mean that.

725
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,800
This is your chance.

726
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,080
Will you pick or not?

727
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:20,830
Mu Qing.

728
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:23,250
You do it.

729
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,720
Sir, I'm just a junior.

730
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,990
I'm telling you to do it.

731
00:38:33,190 --> 00:38:34,160
Do as Godfather says.

732
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:37,370
Yes, sir.

733
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,100
See? This is God's will.

734
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:04,740
Mu Qing.

735
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,380
You're in charge of Dakun's turf.

736
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,450
Wait.

737
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,460
Are you against it?

738
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,500
Both of you, come with me.

739
00:39:36,370 --> 00:39:38,530
Tell me. What's your plan?

740
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:41,700
Sir.

741
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,280
We've already discussed this.

742
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,440
We'll take over Dakun's business.

743
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,200
I want to know

744
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,740
why you want to take over it.

745
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,940
What makes you so sure

746
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:52,740
that I'll let you take over
Dakun's business?

747
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,000
We're very confident

748
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,930
because no one in the group

749
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,310
is a better candidate than us.

750
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:07,750
What a big talker.

751
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,990
Logically speaking,

752
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:12,590
we'll need someone
with a high level of experience

753
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,910
to take over Dakun's business.

754
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,460
Even though Glasses,

755
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,170
Tieguanyin, and Congtou,

756
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,320
are up to the task,

757
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,380
But they have their own duties

758
00:40:21,470 --> 00:40:22,700
and can't do everything at once.

759
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,900
Besides, there is a specialization
in the art industry.

760
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,580
The parts they are responsible for

761
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,470
are equally important to the group.

762
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,270
None should be neglected.

763
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,080
From another perspective,

764
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,290
although the group has grown stronger
in the past two years,

765
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:37,220
there are also more lazy

766
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,070
and useless people at the same time.

767
00:40:39,950 --> 00:40:41,320
But it's different for us.

768
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,770
We have fewer people.

769
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,620
We can easily
get into the swing of things.

770
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,510
That's a good point.

771
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,320
But Dakun's business

772
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,000
isn't an easy task.

773
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,400
Sir.

774
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:53,810
We can reestablish

775
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,130
a new order within the group.

776
00:40:56,980 --> 00:40:59,270
Just like the plant that you're keeping.

777
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:02,170
Instead of trimming the dead leaves
and twigs with scissors,

778
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,150
why not replant it and have it grafted?

779
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,280
If you're willing to give us a chance,

780
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,390
we can make the group thrive

781
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,440
within a year.

782
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:14,320
Well said.

783
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:17,620
But words alone don't prove anything.

784
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,210
I want something more practical.

785
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,860
We can reestablish

786
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,400
Dakun's sales network.

787
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:26,990
And we will weave this net

788
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,410
deeper and denser than before.

789
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,270
Words alone are no proof.

790
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,540
Godfather.

791
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,740
Just give us three months.

792
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:36,710
There's no need.

793
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:38,380
Sir.

794
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:40,580
All we need is a month.

795
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:49,250
