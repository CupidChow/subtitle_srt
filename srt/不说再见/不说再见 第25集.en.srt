Let's catch them by surprise.

4
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:39,479
In my opinion,

5
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,759
we should get rid of Tieguanyin now.

00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,320
Rong Yao said this is too important.

7
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,590
He can't decide on his own.

8

We have to wait for the bureau's response.

9

If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

What are you doing?

11

Are you still mad?

12
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,479
No way.

13
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,860
All I did was kiss you.

14
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,310
Let me tell you.

15
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,380
It's not my job or my mission

Hey.

18
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,840
Hey.

19
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:14,810
What?

20
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:17,050
Is no one allowed to kiss you?

21

No one is allowed.

22
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,770
I see. You have someone special.

23
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,750
Tell me. Who is it?

24
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,490
Tell me.

25
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,870
We've known each other for a while now.

26
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,100
That's enough, Ou Kexin.

27
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,560
Fine, I won't ask.

28
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:00,870
You won't let anyone kiss you?

31

Then...

32
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,890
It's fine if it's me, right?

33
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,150
Did you contact them?

34
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,400
Yes.

35
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,560
Why are you still here?

36
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:05,330
I have nothing to do at home,

37
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,340
so I decided to stay.

38
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,250
Anyway, have you finished
the operation report

39
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,570

40

-It's done.
-Show me.

41

Stop looking.

42

43
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,530
you left it on the printer.

I took it.

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,150
I was so careless.

46
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,080
I must have been distracted.

47
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,360
I'm sorry, Captain Rong.

48

00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:55,880
Cheer for us.

173
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,070
Do your best.

174
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,430
Are you having fun, Xiaoxiao?

175
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,340
Are you having fun?

176
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,320
Come.

177
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,120
Let's show them

178
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,350
the side flip I taught you.

179
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,370
Come on, stand up.

180
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,550
You look strange today.

181
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,790
-Are you sure?
-Of course.

182
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:10,970
-Come on.
-How so?

183
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,210
You look strangely cute.

184
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,710
You're so cheesy.

185
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:45,780
What did you say?

186
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,360
They got back together again?

187
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,040
It looks like Huang Boyuan

188
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:52,240
is not good enough for Ms. Ou.

189
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,030
Kexin is quite an opinionated girl.

190
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,050
It's normal for her to create a ruckus.

191
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:00,160
Is Huang Boyuan all right?

192
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,620
He's fine.

193
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,640
It's just that

194
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,840
his pride is hurt, so he's a little sad.

195
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,790
I think Huang Boyuan

196
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,020
is a decent guy though.

197
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,230
Sir, do you really think he's a good man?

198
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,080
As a dad,

199
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,280
although I don't want my daughter

200
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,520
to be hurt by love,

201
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,970
I don't want her to be

202
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,240
with the wrong person either.

203
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,300
Do you know what I mean?

204
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,970
I understand.

205
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,740
So talk to him.

206
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,960
Invite him over for dinner tomorrow.

207
00:12:34,570 --> 00:12:36,680
I'll apologize to him on behalf of Kexin.

208
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,000
Sure.

211

You're the first.

212
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,740

214
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:55,910
All right.

215

216

Don't worry. I'm here.

217
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,910

221
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,940
He just misses you.

He wants to have a meal together.

223
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:19,630
Come on.

225
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:24,730
Why are you here too?

226
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,170
I see.

227
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,590
Tell my dad I can't join him.

228
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,490
-I'm leaving.
-Kexin, wait.

229
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,200
Why should I wait?

230
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,520
-I'm not eating.
-Let me explain.

231
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:37,800
How can you be so rude?

232
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,530
-Mr. Ou.
-Dad.

233
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,760
Sit down and eat.

234
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,210
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

235
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:45,190
Sit down.

236
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,970
That's my seat.

237
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,700
Thank you.

238
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:07,190
Mu Qing, try this new tea.

239
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:13,520
It's good. Try it.

240
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,730
Mu Qing, you're a smart man.

241
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,800
I'm sure you understand

242
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:27,160
what Mr. Ou is thinking.

243
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,920
You and Kexin

244
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,340
aren't really a good match.

245
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,180
Kexin and I aren't a good match?

246
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:40,140
Is Huang Boyuan a good match for her?

247
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,390
What Mr. Ou wants

248
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,630
is a son-in-law with a clean background.

249
00:14:45,910 --> 00:14:47,360
Do you think you have that?

250
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,650
Does that mean Huang Boyuan

251
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:50,700
has a clean background?

252
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:54,180
What do you mean?

253
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:58,620
We should always take one step at a time.

254
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,660
Mr. Ou can turn a blind eye

255
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:04,170
to small tricks
that aren't frequently used.

256
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,500
But when it becomes frequent,

257
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:09,270
you're the one who will get hurt.

258
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,760
I don't quite understand

259
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:15,780
what you're trying to say.

260
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,600
But let me give you a piece of advice.

261
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,190
There are things

262
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,650
you shouldn't get involved in.

263
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:25,680
Besides, with your current status,

264
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,750
you should know your place.

265
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,580
Boyuan.

266
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,650
This is your first time
having a meal here.

267
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,850
Don't leave immediately after the meal.

268
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,480
-Chat with me afterward.
-Sure.

269
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,850
Kexin, what do you think?

270
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,660
Good. You two go ahead.

271

I have plans this afternoon.

272
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:49,040
Postpone them to tomorrow.

273
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:51,640
I can't earn money

274
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,000
just by sitting at home like you.

275
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,280
My work is very busy.

276
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,010

on work and career.

278
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,820
Dad, I already told you.

279
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:04,710
Mu Qing and I are back together.

280
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,040
Can you stay out of my relationship?

281
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,330
Sir.

282
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:11,620
If Kexin is busy,

283
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,020
she should focus on her work.

284
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:16,150
It's none of your business.

285

286
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:19,490

290
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:29,660
Let her out when she changes her attitude.

291

I'm not a kid anymore.

292

You can't lock me up in France
as you did before.

293

-It's okay.
-I don't know what to do with her.

Do you really want me to be blunt?

302

From the first day

303
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,060
you introduced Ou Kexin to Huang Boyuan,

304
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,130
I've started investigating him.

305

Five years ago,

306
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:07,410

to that ephedra shipment.

308
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,140
So what?

309
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,700
Are you threatening me?

310
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:19,510
I'm not threatening you.

311
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,880
I just want to tell you one thing.

312
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,829
I like Kexin.

313
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,690
If you have to push her to someone else,

314
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,210
don't blame me for being rude to you.

315
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:45,600
You actually turned against Tieguanyin.

316
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,830
That's too risky.

317
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,070
Don't worry.

318
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,920
Tieguanyin knows what I'm capable of.

319
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,370
She won't suspect anything.

320
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,880
I think Huang Boyuan

321
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:56,640
is a part of Tieguanyin's plan.

322
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:58,620
Tieguanyin won't let this go so easily.

323
00:17:58,710 --> 00:18:00,120
I'm sure this is not the end of it.

324

Soon,

325

no matter which one we attack first,

329

Ruosheng, get ready to make a move.

341
00:19:16,670 --> 00:19:17,910
They want 300 pieces?

342
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,230
Linda, do something for me.

343
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,400
Linda.

344
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,770
Mr. Chao.

345
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,980
Hello, I'm Linda.

346
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:48,220
You're as pretty as your name.

347
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:51,130
Didn't you say you wouldn't see me?

348
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,500
Why would you meet me in broad daylight?

349
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,590
Mr. Chao, 300 pieces are a big amount.

350
00:19:57,990 --> 00:19:59,620
This is our first time working together.

351
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,420
It's only right for my boss

352
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,560
to be cautious.

353
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,410
Yes, it's our first time working together.

354
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,010
But you're not as reliable as Dakun.

355
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,600
Dakun?

356
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,230
He has been missing for over two months.

357
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,900
Over the past two months,

358
00:20:12,990 --> 00:20:13,870
I've run out of stock.

359
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,640
You guys won't suddenly go missing, right?

360
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,920
Of course not.

361
00:20:18,010 --> 00:20:19,370
That's what I want to hear.

362
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:23,110
Take a look. It's a small thing.

363
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:24,960
Here.

364
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,620
It's inconvenient to carry cash around.

365
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,250
It's too heavy to carry gold too.

366
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,350
That's why...

367
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,600
Even after an 80% discount,

368
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,880
if you sell this in the black market,

369
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,910
it's enough to pay
for this batch of goods.

370
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,450
I only have one request.

371
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,620
Can you deliver it within a week?

372
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:47,970
Mr. Chao, you're so particular.

373
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:50,880
Happy to work with you.

374
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,770
Sure.

375
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:58,970
Go ahead.

376
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,690
[It's done.]

377
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,970
Okay. Thank you.

378
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,420
Let's depart.

379
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,230
[What?]

380
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,490
[Full payment? Are you sure?]

381
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,570
I've verified them. It's authentic.

382
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,110
Have you checked the sources?

383
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:19,340
I've checked.

384
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,190
The diamonds are from clean sources.

385
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,600
They're not from the black market.

386
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:25,720
All right, your job is done.

387
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,230
But could this be a trap?

388
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,440
We've got the money.

389
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:32,720
What's there to be afraid of?

390
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:35,090
That's enough. I know what I'm doing.

391
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,580
[Fengzi, increase the production.]

392
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,120
[I want 300 pieces within a week.]

393
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:49,090
What?

394
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,470
Are you serious, Ms. Guanyin?

395
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,380
You want 300 pieces in a week?

396
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,930
As you know,

397
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:00,040
I don't have enough men.

398
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,630
Fine.

399
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,960
I'll find a way to hire more men.

400
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,760
What about the ingredients?

401
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,480
There's not enough?

402
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,060
I'll find a way to solve that.

403
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,960
Remember, I want 300 pieces.

404
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,860
[Hello?]

405
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,870
[Ms. Guanyin.]

406
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,610
What are you doing?

407
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,770
Are you still sleeping?

408
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,880
Get up and work!

409
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,800
I want 300 pieces in a week.

410
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,320
Make sure to hurry up.

411
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,470
Hurry!

412
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,340
Why do you need so much?

413
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:50,950
Sure.

414
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:54,820
Since it's requested by Mr. Ou,

415
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,100
then don't worry.

416
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,240
In three days,

417
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:58,470
I'll make sure

418
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,790
you get everything you need.

419
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,290
All right.

420
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,720
You're good.

421
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,590
Even Mu Qing

422
00:23:13,250 --> 00:23:15,060
didn't realize your trick.

423
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,600
I'm the one

424
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,230
who took that brat in after all.

425
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,870
I know him well enough.

426
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,180
But why didn't Guanyin

427
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,480
use the herbs from the Huang family?

428
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,810
Why would it matter to you?

429
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,600
That's easy.

430
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,890
If Tieguanyin uses

431
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:42,210
the Huang family's herbs,

432
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,760
it will be obvious

433
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,470
that she's becoming a traitor.

434
00:23:46,910 --> 00:23:48,720
By then, you and I
won't have to lift a finger.

435
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,210
Mr. Ou definitely won't let her go

436
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,840
so easily.

437
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:57,470
I'm impressed.

438
00:23:58,490 --> 00:23:59,370
Congtou.

439
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,930
I have done my part.

440
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,390
The rest is up to you.

441
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:07,770
Here.

442
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:31,880
Mr. Congtou.

443
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:33,110
Mr. Congtou.

444
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:41,250
Mr. Congtou.

445
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,060
It's already loaded.

446
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,730
The hay is in too.

447
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,830
It's all done.

448
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,720
All right.

449
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,680
What?

450
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,680
It's all burned down?

451
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:14,080
Congtou, don't fool me.

452
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,760
[Why would I fool you?]

453
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,520
[I'll take a video for you. Hold on!]

454
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,540
[There's a fire in the warehouse!
I'm screwed.]

455
00:25:27,630 --> 00:25:29,080
[I've prepared the goods for you.]

456
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,710
[But everything was burnt down. Look.]

457
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,690
[We've lost all the goods.
See for yourself!]

458
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,440
Is Congtou playing tricks?

459
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:43,110
There's no point in talking about that.

460
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,270
We can't do anything without the herbs.

461
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,820
Mu Qing.

462
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:56,840
Just help me this once.

463
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,410
How am I supposed to help, Guanyin?

464
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,560
There's only so much I can do.

465
00:26:05,250 --> 00:26:06,520
Don't be modest.

466
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,500
I know you can solve this.

467
00:26:09,470 --> 00:26:10,530
How about this?

468
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,550
After this deal,

469
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,100
I'll give you a 30% dividend

470
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:16,690
for all the goods in the future.

471
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,390
I'll try then.

472
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,710
Thank you.

473
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,440
[Hello.]

474
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,060
Did you find out

475
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,600
where Congtou send the ingredients?

476
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,540
I'm right where the ingredients are.

477
00:27:00,110 --> 00:27:01,870
It's about to get interesting.

478
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,060
Come and join me.

479
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,020
Be careful. I'll be right there.

480
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,910
This is from the old man.

481
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,320
He asked you to be careful.

482
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,770
They took down our secret storage.

483
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:46,440
They arrested Dakun.

484
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:49,040
And what happened to Zhao Nan afterward

485
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:52,340
was all planned out by Task Force 84.

486
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,220
Is this the leader?

487
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:06,110
Yes.

488
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,830
He used to be

489
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,590
the leader of the Drug Enforcement Squad.

490
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,260
A few months ago,

491
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,240
he was secretly transferred
back to the city.

492
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:16,670
He's now the leader of Task Force 84.

493
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:22,740
After he came back,

494
00:28:23,050 --> 00:28:24,850
our entire industry

495
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,790
was turned upside-down.

496
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:28,420
Sir.

497
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,230
He doesn't seem easy to deal with.

498
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:34,750
What about Zheng Ke?

499
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,170
I've arranged everything.

500
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,840
The sooner, the better.

501
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,440
You startled me.

502
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,260
How is it going?

503
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,840
They're unloading the goods.

504
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,340
There are four of them.

505
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,260
Is the car ready?

506
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,710
It's ready.

507
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,820
What now?

508
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,780
Let's go.

509
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,700
Let's start.

510
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,310
That's a lot.

511
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,410
Boss.

512
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,080
We've taken care of everyone.

513
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,940
What are you waiting for? Move everything.

514
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:26,910
Let's go.

515
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,380
Hurry up.

516
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,360
Are there anymore inside?

517
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,720
Yes, it's in the back.

518
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,300
Hurry up.

519
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,320
Quickly.

520
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,520
Hello.

521
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:51,500
We found the ingredients.

522
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,820
Tell me your address.

523
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:53,880
I'll deliver them to you.

524
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,630
I'll go back and report to Tieguanyin.

525
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:53,100
It's in a small chemical
industrial complex.

526
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,880
I didn't expect it to happen
right under our noses.

527
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,170
Keep following him. See where he goes.

528
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,280
The shipment has arrived.

529
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,640
Where is this?

530
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:42,990
A place called Super Detergent Factory.

531
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,880
Unload them.

532
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,410
Boss.

533
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,130
The herbs are here.

534
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,540
We can get to work.

535
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:13,310
[Did you check the ingredients?]

536
00:33:13,530 --> 00:33:14,540
I did.

537
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,990
It hasn't been tampered with.

538
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,410
[Great. Get started.]

539
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,610
Hurry up.

540
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,150
Here, Guanyin.

541
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,760
Guanyin, what's wrong?

542
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,120
What's wrong with me?

543
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:39,490
I felt uneasy for the whole day.

544
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,070
I've been doing this for years.

545
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:47,850
Such things had never happened to me.

546
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,310
We just started working together.

547
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,950
Then I got a big order.

548
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,620
Right before we ship the goods,

549
00:33:54,710 --> 00:33:56,340
a problem came up with the ingredients.

550
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:58,360
It's such a coincidence.

551
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,120
Isn't it strange?

552
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,620
Guanyin.

553
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:03,380
Don't be suspicious of everything.

554
00:34:03,770 --> 00:34:05,620
It's impossible for everything

555
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,120
to come at you all at once.

556
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,050
That's true.

557
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:15,429
Once this order is completed,

558
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:17,590
I really want to go on a vacation.

559
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,540
I need to rest.

560
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:25,380
I am so tired, exhausted.

561
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:27,800
I don't want to go on
the roller coaster anymore.

562
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,470
The laundry detergent factory ahead

563
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:04,840
must be Group K's drug factory.

564
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,310
[They pretend to be
a laundry detergent factory,]

565
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,020
[but they're actually making drugs.]

566
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,360
[This is where]

567
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,850
[all Group K's drugs are made.]

568
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:14,220
[So tonight,]

569
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:16,150
[we must take down this drug factory.]

570
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:20,160
Failure isn't an option in today's arrest.

571
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:21,210
Understood.

572
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,480
Linda.

573
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,550
You're here.

574
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,220
That means the ingredients are here too.

575
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,650
We've unloaded two boxes of ingredients.

576
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,060
Let's get to work.

577
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,340
Okay.

578
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,120
Let's start working!

579
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,310
Hurry. Let's get to work!

580
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:02,170
Zheng Ke, what's the situation?

581
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,240
Other than a few guards at the entrance,

582
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:05,560
in the southeast corner,

583
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,450
under the water tank,

584
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,170
entrance one,

585
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:10,490
entrance two,

586
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,940
and entrance three in the factory,

587
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:13,570
there are many suspects.

588
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,640
They have radios with them.

589
00:36:15,730 --> 00:36:17,440
And they're highly likely to be armed.

590
00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:19,990
Be careful during the operation, everyone.

591
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,680
Captain Bao,
Special Police Unit is in position.

592
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:23,650
Got it.

593
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,510
The Special Police Unit
will coordinate with us

594
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,610
to take down their men.

595
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,100
Then Mr. Bao and Zhao Ran,

596
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:30,380
enter the factory

597
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:32,180
and locate the drug manufacturing site.

598
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,510
We must take control of the entire factory

599
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,270
before they find us out.

600
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:37,860
Move out.

601
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:56,560
It's okay.

602
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:42,540
Hurry up.

603
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,710
Mr. Bao, Zhao Ran.

604
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,470
Are you in yet?

605
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,920
We're already in.

606
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,280
[What's going on in there?]

607
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:20,020
There are two levels.

608
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,930
But we haven't figured out
the drug manufacturing site.

609
00:38:23,850 --> 00:38:24,770
Okay.

610
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:27,240
Keep an eye out. Be careful.

611
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,280
Captain, we found the site.

612
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,040
[Second floor, southeast.]

613
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,400
[Spot number 45.]

614
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,250
Can you see what's going on inside?

615
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,400
We can't see.

616
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,070
[Can you get a little closer?]

617
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,480
Yes.

618
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,890
Where are you going?

619
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,920
[You can't enter here. Don't you know?]

620
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,510
I'm talking to you.

621
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:57,790
Can't you hear me?

622
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,010
Move out.

623
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:10,020
Don't move!

624
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:19,430
Don't move!

625
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:20,530
Don't move!

626
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:28,590
Fengzi, what's going on?

627
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:29,770
Scram!

628
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,670
Let's go!

629
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,670
Come on!

630
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,550
Don't move!

631
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:35,680
Don't move!

632
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:46,380
