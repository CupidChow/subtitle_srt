00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:45,250
another buyer for Ecstasy Dream.

176
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,450
Mr. Spectre?

177
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:56,510
I mean Ms. Spectre.

178
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,400
I believe

179
00:14:58,490 --> 00:14:59,850
there must be a misunderstanding.

180
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,530
Things have been very tense lately.

181
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:03,240
Everything that my godfather does

182
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,470
will draw attention.

183
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,280
So he had no choice

184
00:15:06,370 --> 00:15:07,730
but to send me here to meet you.

185
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,230
I hope you can understand.

186
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,730
Please excuse my manners just now.

187
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,300
It's because I never expected

188
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,060
the famous Spectre to be a lady.

189
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,860
I'm sorry for being rude.

190
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:23,220
I trust your godfather's sincerity.

191
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,710
But...

192
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:27,130
I don't have much time

193
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,280
to waste with you guys.

194
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,740
If we don't come to an agreement soon,

195
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,070
our collaboration

196
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:35,540
will end right away.

197
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,810
Don't worry.

198
00:15:37,610 --> 00:15:39,320
I'm now in charge of Group K.

199
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,080
So this agreement between us

200
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,800
is definitely valid.

201
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,260
That's good.

202
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,640
You've checked the goods before this.

203
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,760
Once we reach an agreement,

204
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,520
I'll arrange for the first shipment

205
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,150
to Yungang right away.

206
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,420
No problem.

207
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,890
I'll transfer the deposit
to your overseas account

208
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,430
through the underground bank.

209
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:00,920
It's okay if you ship the goods

210
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:02,070
after you got the payment.

211
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,830
Once the transaction is complete,

212
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,100
I will arrange for you

213
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,380
to leave Yungang right away.

214
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,180
Okay.

215
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,380
I look forward to working with you.

216
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,840
[Sorry. The number you have dialed]

217
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,250
[is out of coverage area.]

218
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,520
[Please try again later.]

219
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:36,010
[No matter what happens, you must...]

220
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:40,320
If you can't reach me after you met him,

221
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:43,090
that means something has happened to me.

222
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,850
And the one who betrayed me

223
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,740
is Mu Qing.

224
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:48,630
Godfather.

225
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,500
Whether he's a mole or not,

226
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,400
we'll know tomorrow.

227
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,710
[Godfather]

228
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,490
[Ou Kexin]

229
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,400
How is she?

230
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,250
She's fine. She was treated in time.

231
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,610
Her condition has stabilized.

232
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,670
Don't worry.

233
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,250
That's good.

234
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:37,840
Thank you.

235
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,420
-Call me if you need anything.
-Okay.

236
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,020
Hello, Ruosheng.

237
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,520
I can't reach Godfather or Kexin.

238
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,200
Can you reach them?

239
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,600
I can't reach either of them.

240
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,850
What's going on?

241
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,050
[I was wondering the same thing.]

242
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,810
[I went to the vault]

243
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,090
[and noticed]

244
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,890
[a lot of suspicious vehicles and people.]

245
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,490
I suspect that the police are onto us.

246
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,940
So I didn't go in.

247
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:41,590
What's the situation on your end?

248
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:44,100
I'm safe for now.

249
00:20:45,330 --> 00:20:46,560
But I guess

250
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,600
something must have happened

251
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,700
to Godfather and Kexin.

252
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,650
I got a call from Spectre.

253
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,890
Spectre?

254
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,710
I don't know how he got my number.

255
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,510
He hung up very quickly.

256
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,400
He said he'd call again when he's safe.

257
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,000
Ruosheng.

258
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,230
Where are you now?

259
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,200
I'll come to you.

260
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,210
Don't look for me.

261
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,320
Don't call me either.

262
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,790
We can't escape if we're bugged.

263
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,160
I'll call you when it's safe.

264
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,320
Hello, Rong Yao.

265
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,360
[How is Rong Yu?]

266
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,300
Her condition is basically stable

267
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,400
and no longer critical.

268
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,420
Director Liu.

269
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,560
We've been planning

270
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:19,880
to arrest Spectre for so long.

271
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,910
But now that we almost got him,

272
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,180
we are completely clueless.

273
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,380
We don't even know how Spectre looks like.

274
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,540
Arresting him is like
finding a needle in a haystack.

275
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,400
Director Liu.

276
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:31,900
I've been thinking.

277
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,140
Mr. Ou used our undercover agents

278
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,590
to give us the wrong information.

279
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,870
It means that their identities

280
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,500
were revealed a long time ago.

281
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,650
In other words, our undercover agents

282
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,240
were always in danger.

283
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,440
We had no idea at all

284
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,840
and couldn't fight back.

285
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,740
That's just too pathetic.

286
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,840
He's right.

287
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:51,260
That's what I can't get over with too.

288
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,910
I understand how you all feel.

289
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,580
But now...

290
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,920
is not the time for finger-pointing.

291
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,990
Spectre hasn't been caught yet.

292
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,400
My only hope right now

293
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,730
is that everyone stays on their toes.

294
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:07,310
We must not give up

295
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,290
until the very end.

296
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,310
Do you understand?

297
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,630
Yes, sir.

298
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,690
Director Liu.

299
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,320
I just got word from Yuanwen.

300
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,210
Spectre got in touch with Li Ruosheng.

301
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,810
And we just heard back from Director Wang.

302
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:21,480
Interpol has confirmed

303
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:22,850
that Spectre has reached Yungang.

304
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,340
He’s currently in contact

305
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:25,660
with someone from Group K.

306
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:28,260
It looks like it's Li Ruosheng.

307
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,230
That's great.

308
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,580
We have to suppress the news

309
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:35,250
that Ou Zhenhai was caught.

310
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,320
Once Spectre senses it,

311
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,130
he'll definitely find a way out.

312
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,190
Our next mission is to secure

313
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,650
all immigration control points.

314
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,050
We must make sure

315
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,370
Spectre doesn't leave Yungang.

316
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,560
Yes, sir!

317
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,880
Why are you looking at me like that?

318
00:24:00,330 --> 00:24:02,800
Skylark is your younger sister.

319
00:24:05,570 --> 00:24:06,670
It was unexpected, right?

320
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,620
What else are you hiding from me?

321
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,860
Rong Yu.

322
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,700
Actually, I sort of admire her.

323
00:24:21,890 --> 00:24:23,120
For a mission,

324
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:25,150
she would get a plastic surgery

325
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,610
to look like a drug dealer's daughter.

326
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,520
That's how she'll look like

327
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,660
for the rest of her life.

328
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:35,180
Every time she sees this face,

329
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,740
it will be like opening an old wound.

330
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:44,020
This is too much to ask from a woman.

331
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,320
That takes a lot of courage.

332
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:50,710
Do you know how I felt

333
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:55,680
when I first found out

334
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,940
that Ou Kexin was my sister?

335
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,860
I felt like I had found what was lost.

336
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,810
At that time, I was really upset.

337
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,720
But I was quite happy at the same time.

338
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,140
There was a time

339
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,460
when I really wanted to see her.

340
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:15,920
But I also knew that
even if I went to see her,

341
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:17,590
she would pretend not to know me.

342
00:25:19,130 --> 00:25:21,470
The pain of not being able
to acknowledge your own siblings.

343
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:26,570
Do you know what that feels like?

344
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,520
I can't wait for this to be over.

345
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:39,590
Once we catch Spectre,

346
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,230
they can resume
their true identities again.

347
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,430
Then all of this

348
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,990
can finally get back on the right track.

349
00:25:55,570 --> 00:25:56,580
I'm sure it will.

♫ In the evening, by the serene beach ♫

352
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:23,860
♫ From my camera,
you're looking at the shore ♫

00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:31,120
♫ I hope our hearts will never sway ♫

♫ I want to fill my world up with you ♫

What are you thinking about?

356
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:40,800
You're awake.

♫ If love is
the destination of wandering ♫

358
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,270
Do I look like I'm sleep talking?

359
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,280
You're still in the mood to talk back?

360
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,970
♫ Your smile blurs my sight ♫

361
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,590
I guess I really should look for a chance

362
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,950
to teach you a lesson.

363
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,760
I told you so many times to be careful.

♫ At this moment, I am lost for words ♫

365
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,740
But why did you forget about it

366
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,700
But I'm...

367
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:00,290
Don't get up.

♫ And let me kiss the edge of your nose ♫

371
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,260
Can you be a little more obedient?

372
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,530
I'm fine now.

373
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:11,680
♫ The wind blows past you

♫ What we experience is love ♫

Don't get up.

00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,660
I'm fine. I'm really fine.

You're awake.

390
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,890
My brother-in-law and sister-in-law.

391
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:53,750
Stop that nonsense.

392
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,080
Come on.

393
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,180
Have a seat here.

394
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,530
I brought you fresh flowers.

395
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,680
Thank you.

396
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,660
How are you feeling?

397
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:10,770
Not too bad.

398
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,830
I'm just a little dizzy.

399
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:13,680
Why are you still sitting up?

400
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:14,730
Lie down.

401
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,680
I've been lying in bed all day. I'm fine.

402
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:18,820
Don't listen to him.

403
00:28:18,910 --> 00:28:21,160
He's worried, but he doesn't know
how to express himself.

404
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,620
Yes, my sister-in-law.

405
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,400
Anyway, don't think about anything now.

406
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,950
The most important thing right now
is that you rest well. Okay?

407
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,320
So what happened at the bureau after that?

408
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,220
Didn't she just ask you
to not think about anything else?

409
00:28:42,410 --> 00:28:43,730
I'm just thinking that

410
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:47,120
since Ou Zhenhai had suspected my identity

411
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,660
and had doubts about us long ago,

412
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,370
then could it be possible

413
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,310
that he was lying about Spectre

414
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,450
coming to Yungang?

415
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,440
We were indeed set up by Ou Zhenhai.

416
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,030
But we've got news.

417
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,660
It's true that Spectre came here.

418
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,340
Spectre already came to Yungang?

419
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,530
That's right.

420
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,110
I heard it from Director Wang himself.

421
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,660
According to Interpol's intel,

422
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,000
Spectre probably arrived at Yungang

423
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,890
before you guys were injured.

424
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,070
So he did come.

425
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,960
But when Li Ruosheng called me,

426
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,890
he didn't mention
that Spectre was already here.

427
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:22,530
Li Ruosheng sounded like

428
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,070
he didn't know Spectre's whereabouts.

429
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,660
He just said that Spectre was anxious

430
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,020
because he couldn't reach Mr. Ou.

431
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,660
Also,

432
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,350
he might have noticed
that our men are watching him.

433
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:35,120
So he asked me how I was doing

434
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,440
and hung up in a hurry.

435
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,930
He said he'd call me again later.

436
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,870
We've suppressed the news

437
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,330
that Ou Zhenhai was caught.

438
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,000
I don't think Li Ruosheng knows about it.

439
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,800
But here's the problem.

440
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,810
Ou Zhenhai has probably had his guards up
against you two long ago.

441
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,270
He even set up such a big trap to lure us

442
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,250
after knowing you're not his daughter.

443
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,730
So I suspect Li Ruosheng might have known

444
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:02,490
about your true identities.

445
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,810
Will it be too risky

446
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,170
for you to contact him again?

447
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,390
If Li Ruosheng has found out my identity,

448
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:11,020
with his temper,

449
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,270
it's impossible for him
to not make a move at all.

450
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:15,910
Whatever it is,

451
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,450
this is a good opportunity.

452
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,170
It could also be our last and only chance.

453
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:22,990
I have to take my chances

454
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,180
and take the risk.

455
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,950
I know Li Ruosheng the best.

456
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,020
If anything unexpected happens,

457
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,470
I will be able to handle it.

458
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:33,110
What are you planning to do?

459
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,180
For now, we don't know

460
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,580
where Li Ruosheng is hiding.

461
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,840
If he had really gotten in touch
with Spectre

462
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:41,200
or had closed the deal,

463
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:42,960
he'll definitely hide away

464
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,240
the dark web trading system.

465
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:46,480
That is what Spectre values the most.

466
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:48,160
So...

467
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,090
I'm planning to go check out the dark web.

468
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:52,200
We might find something.

469
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,620
Sure. I'll take care of the rest.

470
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,470
Our men will be tracking
his location as well.

471
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,530
Okay.

472
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,240
I'll go with you.

473
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,310
Your mission right now

474
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,760
is to take care of yourself.

475
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,700
Once you recover,

476
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:06,240
you can show off all you want.

477
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,350
Mr. Mu.

478
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:28,280
Why are you here?

479
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,600
Where is everything?

480
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:31,670
We've moved everything away.

481
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:33,520
Mr. Li said

482
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:37,610
it's something our big client values.

483
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,850
So he sent me and others here
to move everything away.

484
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,790
Which big client?

485
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,200
I don't know.

486
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:46,280
Where's Li Ruosheng?

487
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,920
I don't know that either.

488
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:50,370
Because he turned off his phone

489
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,820
after he called me yesterday.

490
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,050
I can't reach him either.

491
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,710
All right.

492
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,980
If you see Li Ruosheng,

493
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,040
tell him to call me.

494
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:00,090
Sure.

495
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:01,770
Goodbye, Mr. Mu.

496
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,970
Hello, boss.

497
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,690
Mu Qing was here.

498
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,240
I said what you told me to say.

499
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,740
[So he did go.]

500
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,690
Boss, you're a prophet indeed.

501
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,500
[Don't flatter me.]

502
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,480
[What else did he say?]

503
00:32:33,310 --> 00:32:34,940
He asked me to tell you

504
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,960
he was looking for you.

505
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,810
[Okay, got it.]

506
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,920
[Arrange the stuff and men I asked for.]

507
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:42,950
[Do as we planned tomorrow afternoon.]

508
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,180
Okay. Got it.

509
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,940
Yuanwen was right.

510
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,220
Li Ruosheng and Spectre

511
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,490
have come to an agreement.

512
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,380
Otherwise, he wouldn't have risked

513
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:51,750
moving the dark web system away.

514
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,930
Keep in touch with Yuanwen.

515
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,170
Once Li Ruosheng calls,

516
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,670
track his location immediately.

517
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,640
Yes.

518
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:02,840
[Police for the public]

519
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,500
Did something happen to Mr. Ou?

520
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,900
How is that possible?

521
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,490
Godfather said

522
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,120
he has had too many eyes on him lately.

523
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,920
It's difficult for him to leave his house.

524
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,810
So it's better for him to be careful.

525
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,050
Since he has drawn a lot of attention,

526
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,540
I don't want to disturb him either.

527
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:32,400
I'll leave first thing tomorrow morning.

528
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,380
Why are you in such a hurry?

529
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:36,980
Godfather had specially asked me

530
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,430
to make you feel welcome.

531
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,370
So that you could stay here
for a few more days.

532
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:42,130
Once things have died down,

533
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,670
I will send you off.

534
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,150
You have been a good host.

535
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:55,630
Since he wanted you to stay longer,

536
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,670
that means it's not suitable
for you to travel.

537
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,489
Other than you guys,

538
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:13,760
no one knows who I really am.

539
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:17,810
I don't need to sneak around.

540
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,880
It's for the sake

541
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:21,730
of both our interest and security.

542
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:24,370
Please don't make it hard for me.

543
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,460
Keep an eye on her.

544
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,170
Make sure she stays here.

545
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,139
Okay.

546
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:51,250
Mr. Li.

547
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,520
I just got a call.

548
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:53,980
The first shipment has arrived.

549
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,250
What do we do?

550
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,880
Let me think about it first.

551
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,290
By the way,

552
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:04,400
our men at the club said

553
00:35:04,490 --> 00:35:06,470
Mu Qing came to ask for your whereabouts.

554
00:35:10,210 --> 00:35:11,310
Did he come alone?

555
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,120
Yes, he was alone.

556
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,660
What did he say?

557
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,820
He said to call him when you come back.

558
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:26,100
There's still no news on Godfather, right?

559
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,460
No.

560
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,040
Have you prepared what I asked you to?

561
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,310
Yes, I'm already preparing it.

562
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,200
That's good.

563
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,210
What are you looking at?

564
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,620
All this time,

565
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,640
I had lived every single day in fear.

566
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,470
I didn't even have the mood
to look out the window

567
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,790
even if the view was good.

568
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,190
Now that my undercover mission is over,

569
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,010
it feels so unreal.

570
00:36:21,970 --> 00:36:23,600
I'm even a little...

571
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,000
Are you not used to it?

572
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,560
To be honest,

573
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,540
I'm not used to it either.

574
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,620
Before this, I was addressed as Mr. Mu

575
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,730
every single day.

576
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,750
Occasionally,

577
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:46,260
you and Rong Yao would call me Yuanwen.

578
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,280
I would go blank.

579
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,260
I almost forgot

580
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,240
that Yuanwen is my real name.

581
00:36:56,730 --> 00:36:58,840
Finally, I don't have to be
Ou Kexin anymore.

582
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,890
But after everything that had happened

583
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,000
and after going through so much,

584
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,670
I think I can't go back

585
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,250
to be the old Rong Yu anymore.

586
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,650
I know you can't go back to how you were.

587
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,480
But you're still the one I love the most.

588
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,990
You'll always be my Rong Yu.

589
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,120
I know.

590
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,540
I've always known that.

591
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:33,780
Right.

592
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,800
You haven't told me.

593
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,040
How did you turn into Ou Kexin?

594
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,440
I requested it myself.

595
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,310
When did that happen?

596
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,520
After the explosion three years ago,

597
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,290
I was disfigured.

598
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,540
Back then,

599
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,060
I didn't even know how to continue living.

600
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,800
I almost lost the courage to live.

601
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,580
I didn't know how to face you either

602
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:10,960
and my brother.

603
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,010
The Skylark Project has always been there.

604
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,070
The higher-ups wanted me

605
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,660
to get close to Ou Kexin,

606
00:38:18,750 --> 00:38:20,640
destroy Group K’s defense,

607
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:22,090
and get closer to Ou Zhenhai

608
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,540
to gather evidence of his crime,

609
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,570
then lure Spectre out in the end.

610
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:28,290
But nobody expected

611
00:38:28,690 --> 00:38:30,930
that Ou Kexin would lose her life

612
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,830
in an explosion three years ago.

613
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:34,760
That was when the trail ended.

614
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:37,840
And at that time,

615
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,450
my incident turned into an opportunity

616
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,990
for this mission.

617
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:46,070
Both my appearance and age

618
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:47,560
are very similar to Ou Kexin.

619
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,500
That's when I thought

620
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:53,460
if I couldn't go back to being Rong Yu,

621
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,600
maybe I could be Ou Kexin

622
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,840
and help the bureau to get the job done.

623
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,220
I thought it was the best arrangement

624
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,360
heaven made for me.

625
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:06,040
So...

626
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,260
I requested the higher-ups

627
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,500
for me to have plastic surgery

628
00:39:11,590 --> 00:39:12,640
to look like Ou Kexin.

629
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:14,540
Rong Yu.

630
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:16,030
Are you ready?

631
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,560
[Before I removed my stitches
after the plastic surgery,]

632
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,020
[I was secretly sent back
to France by Director Wang.]

633
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,920
[When I woke up,]

634
00:39:29,410 --> 00:39:31,650
[I had become Ou Kexin.]

635
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,600
[And the only thing I had to do]

636
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,240
[was be like Ou Kexin.]

637
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:45,110
[Be it her posture, personality,]

638
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,180
[the tone of her voice,]

639
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:50,090
[or her way of doing things.]

640
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,190
[And even those habits]

641
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:52,860
[that she didn't even realize herself,]

642
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,220
[I had to learn them all]

643
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,550
[and become like her.]

644
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:15,560
[It might sound strange.]

645
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,810
But being Ou Kexin

646
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:20,750
had given me hope

647
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,440
and a reason to live.

648
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:52,780
Do you know

649
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,850
what was the hardest part back then?

650
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,230
What is it?

651
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,480
I thought she was a spoiled brat.

652
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:01,850
I didn't expect

653
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:03,870
her persistence for art

654
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:06,200
and sharp fashion sense.

655
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,270
I've never had any of those.

656
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,600
It's not strange.

657
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,210
You've always been terrible at art.

658
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,470
If you keep saying that,

659
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,520
I'll stop telling.

660
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:19,840
Okay, fine.

661
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,960

00:42:19,290 --> 00:42:22,410
♫ Give me the sadness of being lonely ♫

680
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,650
♫ If your gaze gives me ♫

681
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,810
♫ A sense of direction ♫

682
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:31,560
♫ I'll give you an answer too ♫

683
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:45,730
♫ Looking at your turbulent silence ♫

684
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,670
♫ I really hope you can understand ♫

685
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:58,090
♫ So I remain extremely quiet and gentle ♫

686
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:04,160
♫ Waiting for you to kiss my forehead ♫

687
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,800
♫ It seems you're in front of me ♫

688
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:09,530
♫ Like the four seasons in my heart ♫

689
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,740
♫ Gentle and heart-wrenching ♫

690
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:15,650
♫ What can I say? ♫

691
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,900
♫ At the place farthest away ♫

692
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,070
♫ Only then will the kites roam freely ♫

693
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,620
♫ If I gaze relentlessly ♫

694
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,970
♫ I wonder if there will be starlight ♫

695
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:30,870
♫ Standing on your spot ♫

696
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:34,390
♫ Only then will I forget
the faraway place ♫

697
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,620
♫ Only your gaze ♫

698
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:38,920
♫ Can give me acknowledgment ♫

699
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:45,220
♫ Can give me an answer ♫
