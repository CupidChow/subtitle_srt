If I win,

you have to do me a favor.

you'll owe me three favors.

That's impossible.

10
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,620
I'll prove to you

11
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,289

Tell me. Who sent you here?

Dad, these two brats tailed me.

51
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,090
If I didn't spot them,

52
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,160
I don't know what they might do to me.

53
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:37,790
We're innocent, Mr. Ou.

54
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,470
We were hired to keep Ms. Ou safe.

55
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,060
Why would we hurt her?

56
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,079
Hired to protect me?

57
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:47,250
Then tell me, who hired you?

58
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:48,440
Why did they hire you?

59
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,450
Well...

60
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,970
Why are you looking at Mr. Glasses?

61
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,280
Tell me.

62
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,400
I hired them.

63
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,650
I'm sorry, Kexin.

64
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,630
I should have asked for your permission.

65
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:08,720
I'm doing this to keep you safe.

66
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,320
You know that your safety

67
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,430
has always been Mr. Ou's top priority.

68
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,070
So whenever you go out,

69
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,040
I have to make sure

70
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,089
nothing happens to you.

71
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:20,029
Dad.

72
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,700
This is just a misunderstanding.

73
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,460
Glasses is right.

74
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:25,180
Although they caused you a bit of trouble,

75
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,500
they mean well.

76
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,870
Kexin, how about this?

77
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,320
If you don't like it,

78
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,180
I'll get rid of those two for good.

79
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,500
Get rid of them right now.

80
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,560
Glasses.

81
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,580
From now on,

82
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,040
you should get Kexin's permission

83
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,180
for such an arrangement.

84
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,540
Yes, I will.

85
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,390
It's all my fault. I won't do it again.

86
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:44,930
Leave.

87
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,880
I have something to ask you.

88
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,960
You and Mu Qing...

89
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,650
How far has your relationship developed?

90
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,400
I think

91
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:06,400
he is really starting

92
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,650
to fall for me.

93
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,860
What do you mean? I don't understand.

94
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,450
Yesterday...

95
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,640
Just last night,

96
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,280
he agreed to be my boyfriend.

97
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,980
Today was our first date.

98
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,240
What's with your face?

99
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,560
Even Guanyin said

100
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,230
that Mu Qing and I are both single,

101
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,550
so we should give it a try.

102
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,130
Besides,

103
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:36,810
I've been observing him for a long time.

104
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,740
I really think he's a smart

105
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,890
and decent person.

106
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,040
He was the one who encouraged me

107
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,450
to start a clothing business.

108
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,550
Did you forget?

109
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,710
What's wrong with both of you?

110
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,720
I'm happy.

111
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:53,090
Shouldn't you be happy for me

112
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,190
and give me your blessing?

113
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:55,150
I don't understand.

114
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,000
What's so good about Mu Qing?

115
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,150
Then I don't understand.

116
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,380
What's wrong with him?

117
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,450
Other than what I just told you,

118
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,780
both of you know his capabilities well.

119
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:05,540
Besides,

120
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,170
if we get together,

121
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,940
we can help lighten your burden too.

122
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:11,830
What burden do I have?

123
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,100
Even if I have burdens,

124
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,860
I don't need to share them with anyone.

125
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,820
Dad, that's not what I meant.

126
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,240
Please don't be like this.

127
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,490
I don't want you to work so hard.

128
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:24,460
What's more,

129
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:26,040
I can always get a new boyfriend.

130
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,490
But you're my one and only dad.

131
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,770
Don't worry.

132
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,000
I won't abandon you.

133
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,060
I want to be with him.

134
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,740
-Don't do this. Don't stop me.
-Okay, I won't talk about it anymore.

135
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,970
I only have one condition.

136
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,640
You must ask my permission

137
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,050
if you ever want to get married.

138
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,260
You deserve a better man.

139
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,450
Why must you pick him?

140
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,650
Stop acting like a child and play around.

141
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,280
Can you not be so old-fashioned?

142
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,960
Stop being so paranoid.

143
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,740
Can't we ignore what others think

144
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,580
and just talk about love?

145
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,900
"Love"?

146
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,800
What do you know about love?

147
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:01,060
Love.

148
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,140
When it hits you,

149
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,830
you will see sparks fly.

150
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,680
It makes you feel like

151
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,790
the world is spinning around you.

152
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,780
It's beautiful.

153
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,160
I can't take it anymore.

154
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,860
-I can't take it anymore.
-Mu Qing makes you feel this way?

155
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:25,880
I'm not telling you. Take a guess.

156
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,950
Sir.

157
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,290
I've sent Kexin home.

158
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:42,380
She's still a young and immature child.

159
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,620
You have to assist her at all times.

160
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,510
Let her do whatever she wants.

161
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,450
Just make sure she doesn't take
the wrong step.

162
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,510
I got it.

163
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,190
Tell me.

164
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,330
What's so special about that brat Mu Qing?

165
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:58,880
Why does Kexin like him so much?

166
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,530
Young people these days

167
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,940
think very differently from us.

168
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,490
Things that we don't agree on

169
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:10,100
might be something Kexin appreciates.

170
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,680

Your expression.

339
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,960
Okay, stop.

340
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,560
Stay still. Go.

341
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:09,850
Turn back.

342
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,220
Steady. Don't shake.

343
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:14,510
Adjust your rhythm.

344
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:19,260
Why do you want to see me here?

345
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,640
There are only a few

346
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:23,750
who are able to discover their own talent.

347
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:24,980
And they're lucky.

348
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,750
You're the one
who gave me this opportunity.

349
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,470
So I want you to see it for yourself.

350
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,640
Look at that.

351
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,020
It's Fashion Week soon.

352
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,000
I invited Xiaowei to be my model.

353
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,690
But now, he needs
a new identity and ID card.

354
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,810
He also needs to make sure

355
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,530
he has cut all ties with those people.

356
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,990
I'll take care of that.

357
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,790
Do you feel that he has turned
into a different person?

358
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:54,940
You're right.

359
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,400
Okay, keep walking.

360
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,590
Do we have a new mission?

361
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:07,130
It's not exactly a new mission.

362
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,020
There's just a reminder for us

363
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,780
to be more cautious for the next few days.

364
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,560
I got it.

365
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,600
By the way,

366
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,540
Fashion Week is coming up.

367
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,440
Come and be my date on that day.

368
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,000
Sure.

369
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:30,330
Hello.

370
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:31,790
Is the consignee there?

371
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,560
I don't see anyone at all.

372
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,580
These goods are worth six million yuan.

373
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,550
It's a lot of money.

374
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,870
There's no room for mistakes.

375
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,820
Don't hand over the goods
until you see them.

376
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:42,830
Stay safe.

377
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,240
I don't need you to tell me that.

378
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,090
Well...

379
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:49,340
Regarding Fashion Week, you and Kexin...

380
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,600
Don't worry. I've saved you a ticket.

381
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:54,800
That's great. Thank you.

382
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:29,730
It's you?

383
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,280
What's wrong?

384
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,840
I'm asking if you're the one

385
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,070
who's passing us the goods.

386
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,530
My boss is waiting.

387
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,000
You're here to pick up the goods?

388
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:44,430
I thought you were here for a photo shoot.

389
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,580
Sending six pretty ladies for pickup,

390
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,430
I'm very curious to know who your boss is.

391
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,190
You're handsome too.

392
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,570
Thank you.

393
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,340
Mr. Mu.

394
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,750
Did the payment come in?

395
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:19,710
Not yet.

396
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,910
They want to see the goods first
before making payment.

397
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,100
The payment is in.

398
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:45,760
Split them into ten bills.

399
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,350
Credit into account number three.

400
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,310
Remember this.

401
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:49,680
Launder it seven times.

402
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:50,870
Got it.

403
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,670
[Ms. Guanyin,]

404
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,300
they're starting to launder the money.

405
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,330
We'll intercept all of them as planned.

406
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,190
Transfer them to our account.

407
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:12,430
Okay.

408
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,220
Here I come.

409
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,770
Guanyin, we have received the package.

410
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,870
Good.

411
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,400
What is going on?

412
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:44,900
What's wrong?

413
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,960
-My keyboard is not working.
-Mine too.

414
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,860
-Mine doesn't work either.
-Mine too.

415
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,090
What is going on?

416
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,680
Hurry and check account number three.

417
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:53,960
-Yes.
-Hurry!

418
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,570
The account is empty.

419
00:24:07,470 --> 00:24:08,880
[This page cannot be accessed.]

421
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,140

422
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:21,590

What is this?

425
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:32,810
Can't you see?

426
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:34,750
We've been hacked.

427
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,840
We've been hacked?

428
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,910
Who hacked us?

429
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,840
Don't we have multiple firewalls?

430
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:43,940
How can we be hacked?

431
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,810
I installed the firewalls myself.

432
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,130
There are four layers in here.

433
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,890
There's no way any outsiders can break in!

434

So you mean this is an inside job.

435

Is that what you're saying?

436
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,940
This must have happened in this house.

437

Can someone tell me what this is?

442
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,320
Listen to me.

443
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,130
I don't know where this came from

444
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,110
and when it was installed.

445
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,090
I eat, drink,
and drop the deuce every day.

I almost grow root here.

to your godfather!

Wait. How is this my fault?

Are you crazy?

Where did that thing come from?

453
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:43,970
Ms. Guanyin.

454
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:46,570
Six million yuan worth of goods
are gone just like that.

455

Mu Qing is doomed.

00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,540
Glasses found this IP address

508
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,820
from your server.

509
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,280
Do you know where it leads?

510
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:10,650
I don't know.

511
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,320
Yungang Municipal Public Security Bureau.

512
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:14,920
Public Security Bureau?

513
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,350
That's impossible.

514
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,330
Is someone trying to play tricks?

515
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,150
Play tricks?

516
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,700
You tell me.

517
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,550
Do you think someone is playing tricks?

518
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,660
Can you tell me

519
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:36,120
why Public Security Bureau's IP address

520
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:38,020
appeared on your server?

521
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,540
Mr. Ou.

522
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,310
You will know when you look at my server.

523
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,470
I want you to say it yourself.

524
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,590
We got the server

525
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,790
from Dakun's Internet cafe.

526
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,520
Do you think you could defame Dakun

527
00:31:58,610 --> 00:31:59,930
just because he's dead?

528
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,890
Mr. Glasses.

529
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,220
You can investigate it.

530
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:07,760
You...

531
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:12,030
Say it out loud.

532
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:16,730
Mu Qing's server is indeed

533
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,450
from Dakun's Internet cafe.

534
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,690
When is Dakun's IP logger dated?

535
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:27,160
In the logger, this IP address

536
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:28,750
has intermittently visited the server

537
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,020
for the past two months.

538
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:32,090
But there's no more record after that.

539
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:33,450
Are you sure?

540
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:35,870
Yes.

541
00:32:36,010 --> 00:32:38,340
That means two months ago,

542
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,540
the police had been keeping an eye

543
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,610
on Dakun's Internet cafe,

544
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,890
which was also his storage base.

545
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,570
Is that what it means?

546
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,130
Yes.

547
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:53,560
So after Dakun was arrested,

548
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,540
there's no more record of surveillance?

549
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:58,310
Bring it here.

550
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,810
I think that's the case.

551
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,420
When you reported this to me,

552
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,400
why didn't you figure things out first?

553
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,900
Sir.

554
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,630
Since I'm in charge of Dakun's turfs now,

555
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,660
I just thought we could save money
by using his old server.

556
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,350
But who knew the police would go so far

557
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,770
and track down Mr. Dakun's server?

558
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:39,500
Mr. Glasses.

559
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,210
We're family.

560
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,880
We work for the same group.

561
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,170
From now on, let's not
let unconfirmed matters

562
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,620
cause us any misunderstandings.

563
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,250
It's not good.

564
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,570
Am I right?

565
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,900
I guess

566
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:54,850
it is a misunderstanding.

567
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,260
Misunderstanding is nothing.

568
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,910
I'm just afraid there would be
a traitor in the group.

569
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:09,500
Stop dealing on the dark web right away.

570
00:34:10,739 --> 00:34:12,540
We'll talk about it
when we get a new server.

571
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:13,989
Yes.

572
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:19,620
Don't let there be a second time.

573
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:24,070
Mu Qing.

574
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:27,980
Let me remind you again.

575
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:30,710
Be nice to Kexin.

576
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,469
Don't let her down.

577
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,830
Don't worry, sir.

578
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,430
You never told me

579
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,060
that we were using Dakun's server.

580
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:16,600
Money isn't a problem.

581
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,140
Look what trouble it had caused us.

582
00:35:18,890 --> 00:35:20,470
I just want to help you save money.

583
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,880
That's nonsense.

584
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,110
Wait.

585
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,770
Guanyin.

586
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,520
Don't forget.

587
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:34,200
You still owe me six million yuan.

588
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,630
Give us a month.

589
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,110
Sure, I'll wait for your good news.

590
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:44,980
Bye, Guanyin.

591
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,900
That brat.

592
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,880
He's so good with his words.

593
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,670
They managed to walk away again.

594
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:09,050
Not entirely.

595
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,420
They will give themselves away one day.

596
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:18,950
Here.

597
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,900
It went well.

598
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:29,200
We may be safe for now,

599
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,560
but no one knows

600
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,100
what's coming next.

601
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:34,220
Let's not worry about the future for now.

602
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,900
But this time,

603
00:36:36,990 --> 00:36:38,220
I must thank you for your help.

604
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:39,670
Don't mention it.

605
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,640
Come here. This is it.

606
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:40,610
Take them all away.

607
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,300
Come on.

608
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,730
That was close.

609
00:37:58,120 --> 00:37:59,350
I'll be more careful next time.

610
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:01,510
It's okay if you're not careful
because you have me.

611
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:12,860
It feels good to have a partner.

612
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,000
Thank you.

613
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,740
We got word from the bureau.

614
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:27,200
They found out where the money went.

615
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,140
They're all in Tieguanyin's bank account.

616
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:31,380
Tieguanyin set you up this time.

617
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,300
It looks like

618
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,710
we have to get rid of Tieguanyin.

619
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,230
Mu Qing.

620
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:47,000
I've been thinking about something.

621
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,780
But I don't know how to tell you.

622
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,580
What is it?

623
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,440
I don't care what your relationship

624
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:55,540
with Kexin is now.

625
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,800
But you must not take it seriously.

626
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:03,500
Kexin got together with you

627
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,570
as a joke.

628
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,330
If you take her seriously,

629
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,360
Godfather will never approve of you.

630
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,640
It will also affect your future.

631
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,970
It might also affect our business.

632
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:15,820
You understand that, right?

633
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:22,290
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

634
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,610
That's good.

635
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,250
What took you so long?

636
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,830
I've been waiting for you.

637
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:50,930
You're all dressed up.

638
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:51,950
Do I look good?

639
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:53,970
Come on.

640
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:56,740
-Hello.
-Yes.

641
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,190
Sir, wait.

642
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,900
This is a ticket for a regular audience.

643
00:40:02,990 --> 00:40:04,130
This is the VIP entrance.

644
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,070
Regular audience has to use the side door.

645
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:07,300
You must have mistaken.

646
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,490
Who's a regular audience?

647
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,560
I'm your designer's best friend.

648
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,610
I'm a VIP too.

649
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,710
I'm so sorry.

650
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:13,990
There are no exceptions.

651
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,050
It's protocol.

652
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:16,150
Kexin!

653
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,310
-The side entrance is over there.
-Where?

654
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,330
It's over there.

655
00:40:21,650 --> 00:40:22,570
I'm sorry.

656
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:26,880
You're here.

657
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:28,770
You look good.

658
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:30,310
Your skin looks so fair.

659
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,320
You too.

660
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:33,000
You look great in this lipstick color.

661
00:40:33,350 --> 00:40:35,280
-Let me introduce you to my boyfriend.
-Hello.

662
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:37,660
-He's handsome.
-Mu Qing, say hello.

663
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,020
Hello.

664
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,560
Hello.

665
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:42,460
Your boyfriend is so handsome.

666
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,520
You guys should hurry
and get a boyfriend too.

667
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,540
I'm still single.

668
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,470
Come on, support us.

669
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,480
The more, the merrier.

670
00:40:48,790 --> 00:40:50,240
-Are you excited?
-I am.

671
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:52,050
Will you buy some of my clothes later?

672
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,460
-Sure.
-Of course.

673
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,960
There aren't any good men around.

674
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,680
That's because the good one is with me.

675
00:40:57,770 --> 00:40:58,870
He's a good guy.

676
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,190

693
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,970
♫ It's pouring ♫

694
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:58,270
♫ The cat is looking at you
from the lonely window ♫

695
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:01,570
♫ In those eyes ♫

696
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:04,730
♫ There are disappointment and memory ♫

697
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,610
♫ It's away from you ♫

698
00:42:08,690 --> 00:42:11,910
♫ Half a teardrop away ♫

699
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:15,910
♫ So much intimacy ♫

700
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,110
♫ Is being remembered ♫

701
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:22,110
♫ You that I love ♫

702
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,330
♫ Seem to melt in my night ♫

703
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:28,710
♫ The pain becomes a sigh ♫

704
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,710
♫ Carved onto the pillows as tears ♫

705
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,530
♫ I miss you ♫

706
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:39,140
♫ You stay silent in my breath ♫

707
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:43,190
♫ Lie with me as you fall asleep ♫

708
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:45,080
♫ Until I wake up from my dream ♫

709
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:50,190
♫ The most romantic oblivion ♫

710
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:53,530
♫ Is to grow old together ♫

711
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:56,780
♫ The longest love ♫

712
00:42:56,870 --> 00:42:58,760
♫ Is not to be heard from ♫

713
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:00,880
♫ I still don't want to believe ♫

714
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,820
♫ So I won't give up ♫

715
00:43:03,910 --> 00:43:07,210
♫ So I cry under the fireworks ♫

716
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:10,510
♫ So I'm afraid to be reminded ♫

717
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,900
♫ That I miss you ♫

718
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:16,450
♫ Maybe I'm still in love ♫

719
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,120
♫ I'm still moved by your words ♫

720
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:20,590
♫ I'm still holding your letters ♫

721
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,270
♫ Until my thoughts turn to ashes ♫

722
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,480
♫ Tears become shooting stars ♫

723
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:30,880
♫ To prove the greatness of love ♫

724
00:43:30,970 --> 00:43:34,180
♫ The most romantic oblivion ♫

725
00:43:34,270 --> 00:43:37,480
♫ Is to live the way you live ♫

726
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:41,050
♫ The longest love ♫

727
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:42,900
♫ Is when things remain unchanged ♫

728
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,100
♫ I'm still waiting for you ♫

729
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:47,820
♫ So don't worry ♫

730
00:43:47,910 --> 00:43:51,170
♫ So you become a secret ♫

731
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:54,510
♫ So I try to be happy ♫

732
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:57,590
♫ Because of you ♫

733
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:01,380
♫ So I'm afraid to be reminded ♫

734
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,250
♫ That I miss you ♫
