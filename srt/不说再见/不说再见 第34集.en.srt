That's what's wrong.

173
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,360
Why would they suspect me?

174
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,470
They suspect that you're the mole.

175
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:23,450
Tell me what happened.

176
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:30,630
[Hello.]

177
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,810
There's an emergency.

178
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,310
I need to see you right away.

179
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,160
[Okay. Let's meet at the usual place.]

180
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,820
I was at the hospital.

181
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:41,540
But I'm definitely not the mole.

182
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,740
How can Glasses just decide
that I'm the mole?

183
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,020
Maybe he's trying
to divert suspicion away from himself.

184
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:48,050
Then tell me.

185
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,640
How could you coincidentally
be at the hospital?

186
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,200
I went to the hospital with Kexin

187
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,220
for her routine gynecological checkup.

188
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,360
Then something so serious

189
00:13:56,450 --> 00:13:57,640
just happened out of the blue.

190
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,020
Don't you think
it's strangely coincidental?

191
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,130
Are you saying

192
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,860
that Glasses is setting you up?

193
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,730
It's not as simple as a setup.

194
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,020
First, he lost Congtou.

195
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,170
Then he lost Xiaoyue and her baby.

196
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:14,890
He can't bear the responsibility.

197
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,690
That's why he needs someone

198
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,750
to take the blame.

199
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,300
He can't blame it on you or Kexin.

200
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,490
That's why he's making me

201
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,680
take all the blame.

202
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,580
What about the wound?

203
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,430
How did you get hurt?

204
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,050
When I was at the hospital with Ou Kexin,

205
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,730
I ran into Glasses's men.

206
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,470
You know he has never liked me.

207
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,140
I've been an eyesore to him.

208
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:42,120
He wanted to take that opportunity

209
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,570
to get rid of me completely.

210
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:45,690
Did he have the guts to do that?

211
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,280
Get rid of you in the open like that?

212
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,270
He certainly won't be able
to get rid of me just like that.

213
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,030
But by leaving a wound like this on me,

214
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,130
he can use it against me

215
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,540
as evidence and as my weakness.

216
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,600
He can use this wound

217
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,090
and say whatever he wants to Mr. Ou.

218
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,120
He can say that I'm a mole
or whatever he wants.

219
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,670
You and Ou Kexin...

220
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,480
You guys are really something.

221
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,890
Whatever disease you're having,

222
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,780
couldn't you have gotten a checkup
another day?

223
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,290
I'm telling you, Mu Qing.

224
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,230
Good thing he sent me today.

225
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,730
Glasses's men are already

226
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,960
waiting for you at the door.

227
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,990
He said if there's a wound on your hand,

228
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,750
he'll finish you off here today.

229
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,830
Look, I told you so.

230
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,180
Glasses is trying to hide the fact

231
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,250
that he lost Xiaoyue and her baby.

232
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,580
So he's putting all the blame on me

233
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,910
and accusing me of being a mole.

234
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,720
Hello, sir.

235
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,840
I'll be there in ten minutes.

236
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,130
If Mu Qing is the mole,

237
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:57,890
keep one thing in mind.

238
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,220
You don't have to be considerate of Kexin

239
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,890
or hold back.

240
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:04,140
Yes, sir.

241
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,400
Rong Yu.

242
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,250
You're finally here.

243
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,020
-Yuanwen was taken away.
-Sit down first.

244
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,410
Li Ruosheng invited Yuanwen
to the hot spring resort.

245
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,550
He was injured today.

246
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,090
And he asked to see him.

247
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,900
I'm afraid his identity has been revealed.

248
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,080
What's wrong?

249
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,060
Say something.

250
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,430
Director Wang said this before.

251
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,460
Once things get out of control,

252
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,100
terminate the operation immediately.

253
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,830
What do you mean?

254
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,150
Explain it to me.

255
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,230
Yuanwen is an agent

256
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,770
planted by Director Liu in Group K.

257
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,190
His mission is to split up Group K,

258
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,520
so you'll have more opportunities

259
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,280
to get close to Mr. Ou and catch Spectre.

260
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,380
But arresting Spectre

261
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,660
is not Yuanwen's main mission.

262
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:10,050
He has almost completed his mission.

263
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,069
Even without this unexpected situation,

264
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,920
he will soon end his undercover mission.

265
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,730
But we can't leave him like this.

266
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:18,710
Even if he won't participate
in other missions,

267
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,560
you have to save him, Rong Yao.

268
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,250
I'll save him no matter what.

269
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,320
Where is he?

270
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,850
Currently, the whole group is in chaos.

271
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,280
Mr. Ou hates traitors the most.

272
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,750
Glasses is by Mr. Ou's side every day.

273
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:40,890
He knows everything.

274
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,450
He'll get rid of me first,

275
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,640
then you'll be next.

276
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,020
Soon, the whole of Group K

277
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,560
will be controlled by Glasses alone.

278
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,110
At this rate,

279
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,310
I won't be safe for long.

280
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:57,300
Ruosheng, you should leave now.

281
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,280
If you stay with me,

282
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,610
Glasses will think
that we're on the same side

283
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,980
and say that you're a mole too.

284
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,220
Buddy, you're really a good friend.

285
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:07,820
Just worry about yourself

286
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,090
at times like this.

287
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,030
Tell me.

288
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,740
What should you do now?

289
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,820
What can I do?

290
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:18,680
How about this?

291
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,030
Figure out how to run away later.

292
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,920
I'll talk to Godfather first.

293
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,420
If he listens to me,

294
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,040
I'll call you back.

295
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,580
If he doesn't listen,

296
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:31,220
you should leave Yungang
and never come back.

297
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,640
Run away?

298
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,120
How?

299
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,220
He's here. Come on out.

300
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,080
Mr. Li.

301
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,020
I'm sorry.

302
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:33,610
Isn't that a bit too harsh?

303
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,080
Come on.

304
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,170
-Over there.
-Okay.

305
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,860
Mu Qing ran away?

306
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,770
Inform our men.

307
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,000
You must catch him.

308
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,950
If he resists, kill him.

309
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,920
Drive faster.

310
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,980
Yes.

311
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,070
Mr. Ou gave us an order.

312
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,660
If you resist, we'll finish you off.

313
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:39,170
Mr. Mu, don't make this hard for me.

314
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,280
Is this what Mr. Ou wants

315
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,430
or what Glasses wants?

316
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,570
After him!

317
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,180
Don't lose anyone. Move out!

318
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:03,280
Yes, sir!

319
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,430
This way.

320
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:47,900
What are you doing?

321
00:21:47,990 --> 00:21:49,000
What do you want?

322
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,680
I'm a police officer. Sorry.

323
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:32,950
Go back and tell Glasses.

324
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,360
Sooner or later,

325
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,030
I'll make him pay for this.

326
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,400
Get lost!

327
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:57,590
[Team One, clear.]

328
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,600
[Team Two, clear.]

329
00:22:58,690 --> 00:22:59,700
[Team Three, clear too.]

330
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,560
Did they move him away?

331
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,420
Bring everyone here.

332
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:17,650
Let me ask you one last time.

333
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,510
Where are Mu Qing and Li Ruosheng?

334
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:26,190
Possession of deadly weapons.

335
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,080
Alleged drug dealing.

336
00:23:28,170 --> 00:23:29,620
Alleged assault.

337
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:31,820
Any one of these is enough
to put you in jail.

338
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,800
Now, speak!

339
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:35,170
They escaped.

340
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,510

Before you arrived,

344
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,030
Mu Qing was chased into the alleyway.

345
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,660
-Chased by how many people?
-Two people.

346
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:48,940
Get down.

347
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:51,450
Mr. Bao, Zhao Ran.

348
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,430
[Look up the three alleys nearby.]

349
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:55,490
Remember,
there are three men including Mu Qing.

350
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,990
They might possess deadly weapons.

351
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,000
Copy that.

352
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,980
Let's go check up on the alleys.

353

Only one unconscious lackey was found.

354
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,560
Mu Qing and the other are missing.

355
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:44,420
-I'll go check out ahead.
-Okay.

356
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,480
Come on.

357
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,000
Captain Rong, there's no sign of Mu Qing.

358
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,030
Contact the Traffic Division right away.

359
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,090
We have to find them
through the CCTV footage.

360
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,280
[Yes, sir.]

361
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,610
Take them away.

362
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,630
Yes.

363
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:06,900
-Come on, get up.
-Get up.

364
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:08,710
-Get up. Move.
-Come on.

365
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,160
Let's go.

366
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,980
Mr. Glasses, they seem like our men.

367
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,670
What do we do?

368
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,630
Let's go back first.

369
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,640
Yes.

370
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,110
Mr. Glasses.

371
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,080
Who is this?

372
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,230
He's one of us.

373
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,720
Get in now.

374
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,530
That's what happened.

375
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,790
So that means

376
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,900
you didn't kill Mu Qing

377
00:26:02,030 --> 00:26:03,000
and let him escape?

378
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,540
I...

379
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,590
Mu Qing has a message for you.

380
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,740
What is it?

381
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,430
Well...

382
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,670
Go ahead. I won't blame you.

383
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,780
He said

384
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,290
for whatever happened today,

385
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,110
he'll settle the score with you one day.

386
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,690
He had the guts to say that.

387
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,930
Mr. Glasses, it seems like Mu Qing

388
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,380
wants you to take the blame

389
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,660
for what happened today.

390
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,170
Okay, I understand.

391
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:45,330
You did a good job. Get some rest.

392
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,950
What else do you want to say?

393
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,980
Have you heard from Mu Qing?

394
00:26:57,250 --> 00:26:58,400
The police were there.

395
00:26:58,570 --> 00:26:59,630
Was he arrested?

396
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,530
No, he ran away.

397
00:27:06,050 --> 00:27:08,120
I really thought
something had happened to Mu Qing.

398
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:10,360
You scoundrel.

399
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,210
Do you really think you can protect him?

400
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,660
I can't protect him.

401
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:17,180
But I couldn't just stand here

402
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:19,290
and watch you kill him

403
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,830
based on Mr. Glasses's claim alone.

404
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,020
His claim?

405
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,250
Fine.

406
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,840
I'll listen to what you have to say.

407
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,330
I'm telling you.

408
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,870
If you can't give me a valid reason,

409
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,060
I'll kill you too!

410
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,090
Okay.

411
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,030
Mr. Glasses tried to kill Mu Qing.

412
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,670
He planned to kill him
before you find out.

413
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,070
But now, it looks like

414
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,100
he didn't just want to kill Mu Qing.

415
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:44,290
He even called the police

416
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,390
to get rid of me too.

417
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,330
This is such a flawless plan.

418
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:53,090
What if Glasses was right

419
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,250
and Mu Qing is a mole sent by the police?

420
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,930
If Mu Qing was the mole,

421
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:58,890
why would he run away?

422
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,680
So you mean

423
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,260
Glasses colluded with the police

424
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,230
to arrest all of you?

425
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,950
Tell me what his purpose is.

426
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,400
He's scared.

427
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:10,860
He's scared that Mu Qing

428
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:12,270
will expose him in front of you.

429
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,500
That's why he set him up

430
00:28:13,590 --> 00:28:14,730
to get rid of him for good.

431
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,490
Then Mu Qing will take the blame for him.

432
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,690
That way, you'll be convinced

433
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:20,280
that Mu Qing is the mole.

434
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,380

435
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,120
that Mr. Glasses is most loyal to you.

436
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,700
I really didn't expect

437
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,980
that he would do such things.

438
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,920
You're overthinking it, kid.

439
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,820
He has been with me for over a decade.

I know him very well.

441

was Mr. Ou's order.

510
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:03,170
[Do you understand?]

511
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:05,460
Understood.

512
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,670
Have faith in me and Yuanwen.

513
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,210
It's going to be okay.

514
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,840
I know.

515
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,590
What are you looking at?

516
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,650
You look so nervous.

517
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,140
I asked you to go home to rest.

518
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:42,110
Why are you here?

519
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,120
Sir.

520
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,020
I want to tell you

521
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,080
about what happened tonight.

522
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,710
Have a seat.

523
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,290
How many were arrested?

524
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,140
More than ten people.

525
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,900
But don't worry, sir.

526
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,260
They're all newcomers.

527
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,620
They're not familiar

528
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,640
with the business yet.

529
00:33:01,210 --> 00:33:02,920
No matter how hard the police investigate,

530
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,290
they won't find anything.

531
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,500
But Mu Qing...

532
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:08,910
Didn't Mu Qing run away?

533
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,590
Don't panic.

534
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,870
Under current circumstances,

535
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,800
no news means good news.

536
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,140
He wasn't arrested after all.

537
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,190
Sir.

538
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,310
I suspect what happened tonight

539
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:23,600
was just a show

540
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,360
put on by Mu Qing and the police.

541
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:30,290
Who is the intended audience?

542
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,250
You're the audience, of course.

543
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:35,440
Goodness.

544
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,900
It was such a big show.

545
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:39,880
It even involved the police and your men

546
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,200
and it caused so much trouble.

547
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,400
All of that was to put on a show for me?

548
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:46,090
Mu Qing is trying to frame me.

549
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:47,630
He and Li Ruosheng

550
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:49,210
have always disagreed with me.

551
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,450
They must be trying

552
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,520
to drive a wedge between us.

553
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:56,910
Glasses.

554
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:00,870
You came here in such a hurry

555
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:02,890
just to tell me that?

556
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:04,570
So that I won't suspect you?

557
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,250
Sir.

558
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,730
I've been with you for over a decade...

559
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:11,739
Glasses.

560
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:17,900
Before this, I had never doubted you.

561
00:34:19,389 --> 00:34:21,810
But someone told me

562
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,630
exactly the same thing you told me.

563
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,750
Do you want to meet this person?

564
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,300
Who is it?

565
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,070
Ruosheng.

566
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,179
Come out and have some tea.

567
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,239
Godfather.

568
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,150
Brat.

569
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:04,100
You came here pretty quickly.

570
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,180
Do you regret not coming here earlier?

571
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:09,510
I regret not keeping an eye on you.

572
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,320
And you let the mole escape.

573
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,660
I let the mole escape?

574
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,250
So to you,

575
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:19,100
I'm also the mole now?

576
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:20,990
It's up to Mr. Ou

577
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,880
to decide who the mole is.

578
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,370
Ruosheng.

579
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,450
Repeat what you told me earlier

580
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,690
to Mr. Glasses.

581
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,230
Mr. Glasses.

582
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,220
I usually call you "Mr. Glasses"

583
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:42,420
because I respect you.

584
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:45,500
But you used Godfather's trust for you.

585
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:47,740
You went behind his back,

586
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,370
accused me and Mu Qing of being moles,

587
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,600
and tried to kill us.

588
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:53,290
This is not
what a respectable senior should do.

589
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:55,220
Now, we don't know where Mu Qing is

590
00:35:55,310 --> 00:35:56,540
and I came back alive.

591
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,090
Are you disappointed?

592
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,870
There has been some unrest in the group.

593
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,190
The dark web had problems,

594
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,200
the factory closed down,

595
00:36:04,290 --> 00:36:05,610
and Tieguanyin committed suicide.

596
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,890
All of these are related to you.

597
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:10,710
You lost Congtou and Xiaoyue.

598
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:13,090
Yet you tried to blame me
and Mu Qing for it.

599
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:14,710
Shut up!

600
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,530
Godfather.

601
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,300
Those were the things that I know.

602
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,410
There are still many things I don't know.

603
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,750
I'm afraid only Mr. Glasses knows.

604
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:26,770
Sir.

605
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,010
I've worked with you for many years.

606
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,660
I'm loyal to you and the group.

607
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,610
Don't listen to his nonsense!

608
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,680
That's all I have to say.

609
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,450
Whether I'm accusing him or not,

610
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,210
you know that very well, Godfather.

611
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,750
This is not a court of law.

612
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,330
And I'm not a judge.

613
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,400
I don't have anymore patience

614
00:36:54,490 --> 00:36:55,630
to hear any of this.

615
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:57,880
But...

616
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,860
today is the last chance for both of you.

617
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,730
If you have something to say, say it now.

618
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:05,270
Sure.

619
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:06,810
Mr. Glasses.

620
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,490
Haven't you always seen me as an eyesore

621
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,860
and wanted to get rid of me?

622
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,700
Sure.

623
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,460
Today, in front of Godfather,

624
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,270
let's sort things out once and for all.

625
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:34,220
Are you scared of saying it?

626
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,520
All right.

627
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:39,630
I'll say it on your behalf.

628
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,580
You pretend to be loyal to Godfather.

629
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:44,120
But secretly,

630
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,010
how much damage

631
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,370
have you done to the group?

632
00:37:49,090 --> 00:37:51,550
Dakun, Guanyin, Congtou.

633
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,270
You got rid of them one after another.

634
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,290
Now, it's my turn and Mu Qing's.

635
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,890
Why are we all in trouble

636
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,210
and nothing ever happens to you?

637
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:01,150
What do you plan to do next?

638
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,650
Do you want to overthrow Godfather

639
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,410
and take over his place?

640
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,730
Do you have a death wish?

641
00:38:10,390 --> 00:38:11,530
Give me the gun.

642
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:15,140
Do you think I won't kill you?

643
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,410
Say it again.

644
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,600
I dare you to say it again!

645
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:19,230
Of course you dare to kill me.

646
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,430
If Mu Qing and I die,

647
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,970
no one will be in your way anymore.

648
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,670
Great, I'll grant you your wish.

649
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:29,040
Where is Mu Qing?

650
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,460
Where is Mu Qing?

651
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,010
Where did you take him?

652
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:39,730
I think I understand it now.

653
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:40,960
Now that Mu Qing is gone,

654
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,720
you want to kill Li Ruosheng too, right?

655
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,020
Kexin.

656
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:48,140
Don't make assumptions.

657
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:52,050
How did you know Mu Qing is gone?

658
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,040
He called and said
you were going to kill him.

659
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:56,500
He also said

660
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,050
that if anything happens to him...

661
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,640
Dad, he wanted me to tell you

662
00:39:01,730 --> 00:39:02,790
that he's not the mole.

663
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:05,910
Do you know where he is?

664
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,870
You're asking me that?

665
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,630
You should know better than I do.

666
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,440
If anything happens to him,

667
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,150
you're all accomplices.

668
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,430
How would I know?

669
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:18,230
My men are looking for him too.

670
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,990
When you texted him,

671
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,440
I was with him.

672
00:39:21,710 --> 00:39:23,030
You texted and asked him

673
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,220
to meet at the hot spring.

674
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,490
He got into trouble

675
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:26,720
not long after he went out.

676
00:39:27,250 --> 00:39:28,570
What are you plotting?

677
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:33,940
You two are working together.

678
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,830
You're something, Li Ruosheng.

679
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,590
When did you learn to collude with others

680
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,650
to kill your own friend?

681
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:40,630
Was Mu Qing with you the whole time?

682
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:42,470
Of course he was with me.

683
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,540
I don't feel well these couple of days.

684
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,950
This morning,

685
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,490
he even went to the hospital with me.

686
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,630
Do you want me

687
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,000
to show you my medical report?

688
00:39:52,770 --> 00:39:53,870
Mr. Glasses.

689
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:56,030
Weren't you at the hospital too?

690
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,360
You didn't tell my dad?

691
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,560
Sir.

692
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,950
I did see Kexin at the hospital.

693
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,240
But I don't see Mu Qing.

694
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,350
Don't think I don't know
what you're up to.

695
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,370
If I weren't there,

696
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,970
Mu Qing would've been dead because of you.

697
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:24,270
Dad.

698
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:26,470
Was all of this your idea?

699
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:38,880
Glasses.

700
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,210
-Sir.
-Go to the study.

701
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,070
Ruosheng, go home.

702
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:55,380
Mr. Glasses is just your subordinate.

703
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:57,540
Without your permission,

704
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,690
he wouldn't dare to go that far.

705
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,890
These were all your instructions.

706
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:02,860
Am I right?

707
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:07,830
Listen to me.

708
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,900
You're still suspecting Mu Qing.

["The Place Farthest Away" playing]

710
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,540
♫ Against the light ♫

711
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:20,060
♫ Your vague silhouette ♫

712
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,620
♫ I reach out with my hands ♫

713
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,140
♫ But my hug passes through you ♫

714
00:41:27,190 --> 00:41:29,880
♫ Maybe this is an illusion ♫

715
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,990
♫ A sweet dream ♫

716
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,720
♫ Waiting for you ♫

717
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,240
♫ To notice it and wake me up ♫

718
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,650
♫ I wonder if getting close to you ♫

719
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,340
♫ One swirl will light up the stars ♫

720
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:49,890
♫ I wonder if someone
will tell you for me ♫

721
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:56,010
♫ At the place farthest away ♫

722
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,440
♫ Only then will the kites roam freely ♫

723
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,600
♫ If I gaze relentlessly ♫

724
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:04,720
♫ I wonder if there will be starlight ♫

725
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:08,070
♫ If the falling fireworks ♫

726
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:11,500
♫ Give me the sadness of being lonely ♫

727
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,170
♫ If your gaze gives me ♫

728
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,940
♫ A sense of direction ♫

729
00:42:16,030 --> 00:42:20,650
♫ I'll give you an answer too ♫

730
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:34,640
♫ Looking at your turbulent silence ♫

731
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:40,800
♫ I really hope you can understand ♫

732
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:47,000
♫ So I remain extremely quiet and gentle ♫

733
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:53,560
♫ Waiting for you to kiss my forehead ♫

734
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:55,670
♫ It seems you're in front of me ♫

735
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,490
♫ Like the four seasons in my heart ♫

736
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,660
♫ Gentle and heart-wrenching ♫

737
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,960
♫ What can I say? ♫

738
00:43:05,090 --> 00:43:07,820
♫ At the place farthest away ♫

739
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:11,340
♫ Only then will the kites roam freely ♫

740
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:13,490
♫ If I gaze relentlessly ♫

741
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,880
♫ I wonder if there will be starlight ♫

742
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,960
♫ Standing on your spot ♫

743
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:23,390
♫ Only then will I forget
the faraway place ♫

744
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,620
♫ Only your gaze ♫

745
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:27,970
♫ Can give me acknowledgment ♫

746
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:33,860
♫ Can give me an answer ♫
