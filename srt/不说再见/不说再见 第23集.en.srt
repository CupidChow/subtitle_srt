[Episode 23]

3
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,340
What's going on with you?

4
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,670
Mu Qing's ex-girlfriend

5
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:38,860
is working for Tieguanyin.

6
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,050
Why didn't you tell me

7
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,100
such an important matter?

8
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,920
Is that true?

9
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,030
Kexin was so mad that she came back home.

10
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,220
How could it be fake?

11
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:50,430
I'm sorry, sir.

12
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,759
This is my fault.

13
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,570
This woman is not that simple.

14
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,900
Not only did she cause Mu Qing and Kexin

15
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:02,840
in a bad relationship,

16
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,600
but she also stirred up a conflict

17
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,100
between Li Ruosheng and Mu Qing.

18
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,100
Have you figured out the taste?

19
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,410
Mu Qing brought something new.

20
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,860
A few computers can make

21
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:17,360
thousands of yuan flow in.

22
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,910
Tieguanyin must be excited.

23
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,579
Even she is all over Mu Qing these days.

24
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,540
I'm sure she has an agenda.

25
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,030
Sir.

26
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,140
I'll look into it.

27
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,290
Keep this in mind.

28
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,460
If Tieguanyin's business

29
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,690
belongs to the group,

30
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:38,960
keep it quiet for now.

31
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,600
If she betrays us for her own benefit,

32
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,620
that's different.

33
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,579
That's the rule.

34
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:48,250
Call Li Ruosheng and Mu Qing here.

35
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,470
You're still alive.

36
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:16,140
How dare a coward like you show up?

37
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,400
You ruined seven of my turfs in one week.

38
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,600
Mr. Ou won't let you get away with this.

39
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,710
Don't use Godfather to pressure me.

40
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,880
Apart from Mr. Ou,

41
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,460
who else can control you?

42
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,620
I'm glad you know.

43
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,470
Li Ruosheng.

44
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,970
Without your godfather,

45
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,510
who do you think you are?

46
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,329
That's enough.

47
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,079
Mr. Ou asks you to come upstairs.

48
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,500
Yes, Mr. Glasses.

49
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,490
Hello.

50
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,570
Run a background check on someone.

51
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,370
You're both here.

52
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,060
Godfather.

53
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,110
-Sir.
-Okay.

54
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,230
The weather is nice, isn't it?

55
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,290
I heard

56
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:40,970
that you two have been so close lately.

57
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,460
Mu Qing.

58
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,830
You go first.

59
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,640
Well...

60
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,010
Is Kexin mad at you?

61
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,730
No.

62
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,440
We're always good.

63
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:04,120
She said she's not talking to you.

64
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,440
She got so angry and came home.

65
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,620
You're saying that's good?

66
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,130
Not at all, sir.

67
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,630
You have the nerve to do it

68
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:12,920
but have no guts to admit it.

69
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,690
I'll speak on your behalf.

70
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,370
Godfather.

71
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,040
He met an old flame

72
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,410
and wanted to go back to her.

73
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,860
Kexin found out about it.

74
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,460
I'm telling you.

75
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,040
I won't hold it against you

76
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,270
for stealing my turf.

77
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:31,090
But when it comes to relationships,

78
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,980
I just can't stand your dubious attitude.

79
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,210
Who's being dubious?

80
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,280
You know exactly who's being dubious.

81
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:38,260
I'm doing this for work and the group.

82
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,400
Fooling around with a woman

83
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,550
is for work and the group?

84
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:41,520
Who's fooling around?

85
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,750
That's enough. Stop arguing.

86
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:47,409
So it is true.

87
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,380
This woman is not that simple.

88
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,020
She made those two brats argue like this.

89
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,720
I've checked it, sir.

90
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,660
When Mu Qing worked as a waiter

91
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,930
at a bar three years ago,

92
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,120
he saved this woman.

93
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,500
She wanted to repay Mu Qing,

94
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,080
but he didn't accept it.

95
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,720
Mu Qing had also just found out

96
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,920
that she's working for Tieguanyin.

97
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,510
What a coincidence.

98
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,500
Don't tell me

99
00:06:20,590 --> 00:06:21,990
it's a trap set by Tieguanyin.

100
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:27,320
Back then, people almost died

101
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,170
because of the two servers.

102
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:32,640
Now, they're getting along so well.

103
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,650
That's interesting.

104
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,320
What do you think?

105
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,159
Mr. Congtou.

106
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,440
Mr. Congtou.

107
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,860
Doesn't he usually stay on his own turf?

108
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,980
Why is he on our turf today?

109
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,940
Why are you here, Ruosheng?

110
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,260
What a coincidence.

111
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,460
What's wrong?

112
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,100
Congtou.

113
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:35,210
What's wrong?

114
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,740
Cheers.

115
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,260
Why are you in a bad mood?

116
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,330
Is it because of Mu Qing?

117
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,880
Did you two have a fight?

118
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,440
Can you not mention him again

119
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:56,720
starting from today?

120
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,400
Here, let's drink.

121
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,660
If it weren't for me,

122
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,000
he would've just been a security guard.

123
00:08:14,060 --> 00:08:16,830
He thinks he's human now.

124
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,240
He puts on an act

125
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,740
in front of me every day.

126
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,020
I can't stand him when he does that.

127
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,320
Ruosheng.

128
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,580
Both of you

129
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,600
have been through so much.

130
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,890
You went through life
and death situations.

131
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,260
If you have anything to say,

132
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,070
can't you sit down and talk?

133
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,100
Congtou.

134
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:43,760
You said we went through life and death.

135
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,580
He doesn't think so.

136
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,630
Is that so?

137
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,870
He's in love with Kexin.

138
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,070
He's climbing the ladder.

139
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,780
He doesn't care

140
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,590
about what we have gone through at all.

141
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,780
Let me tell you a secret.

142
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,120
I liked Kexin first.

143
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:12,580
I liked her first.

144
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,620
Then they started dating.

145
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:16,630
What could I have said?

146
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:18,910
He's my friend. What could I have said?

147
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,430
Let's talk about that...

148
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,460
Linda.

149
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,410
It was me.

150
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,770
It was me first.

151
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,890
She's related to him too.

152
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,110
Ruosheng.

153
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,270
This Linda...

154
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,200
What's with her?

155
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:46,720
Linda is a modeling agent.

156
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,980
She works for Guanyin.

157
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,100
Now, I finally understand.

158
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,610
He doesn't like Linda.

159
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,990
Mu Qing just likes

160
00:09:58,070 --> 00:10:00,540
Guanyin's processing factory.

161
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,270
They want to work together to cut me off,

162
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,110
take me out, and eliminate me.

163
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,080
Do you understand?

164
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:09,380
That's impossible.

165
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,530
No way.

166
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:12,680
What type of person is Tieguanyin?

167
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,640
She cares for nothing but money.

168
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,270
She doesn't allow room for discussion.

169
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:21,170
She won't let it happen

170
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,490
if Mu Qing is in a relationship

171
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,460
with her underling.

172
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,320
Everyone is scared since Dakun got caught.

173
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,520
What's wrong? Tieguanyin is not afraid?

174
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,490
There's a saying.

175
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:39,300
"Wealth is gained from taking risks."

176
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:42,650
At the moment,

177
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,930
I don't know if that rascal

178
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:48,320
dares to collude with Guanyin.

179
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,640
I don't dare to say.

180
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,090
I don't know right now.

181
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,080
It's possible

182
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,460
that those two people join forces,

183
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,560
which means

184
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,320
none of this is related to me anymore.

185
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,420
It's none of my business.

186
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,970
From now on, Mu Qing has gone solo.

187
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,910
I'm out.

188
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,680
I'll be nothing in front of Godfather.

189
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,660
I'm nobody. Do you understand?

190
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:12,920
That shouldn't be.

191
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,930
It's not impossible.

192
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:17,450
I can see very clearly and thoroughly.

193
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,090
Congtou, think about it.

194
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,360
Am I right?

195
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,980
Come on.

196
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,140
[Hello.]

197
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,150
Lily.

198
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,390
Who are you?

199
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,070
Honey.

200
00:12:39,290 --> 00:12:42,010
Honey, I'm Lily.

201
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:44,170
Which Lily?

202
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:46,370
You were drunk.

203
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,440
I brought you here.

204
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,550
You've already forgotten?

205
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:56,050
You're Lily.

206
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,120
I didn't forget.

207
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,730
I was testing you.

208
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:05,910
Honey.

209
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,930
You're tired.

210
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,730
I'll take a shower.

211
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,790
Let's rest early.

212
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,760
Lily.

213
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,370
I'm having a headache.

214
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,090
It really hurts.

215
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,930
Can you give me a massage first?

216
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,620
[It hurts everywhere.]

217
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,250
[Lily.]

218
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:31,380
[Do you have a best friend?]

219
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,450
[Yes.]

220
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,880
[Do you have a guy you like?]

221
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,290
[Yes.]

222
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:41,410
[I just want to know.]

223
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,510
If you and your best friend

224
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:49,990
fall for the same guy at the same time,

225
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,550
what you will do?

226
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:54,480
Then we should play fair.

227
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,170
Play fair?

228
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,200
But I won't do that.

229
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,860
[I'll give my friend everything he likes,]

230
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,080
[be it cars or houses.]

231
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,020
[I can even give him my life.]

232
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,360
But even so,

233
00:14:15,950 --> 00:14:17,890
he still thinks it's unfair.

234
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,970
Congtou is so loyal.

235
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,260
Aren't you afraid he'll tell Godfather

236
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,750
about your affairs with Tieguanyin?

237
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,980
Loyalty is void in front of benefits.

238
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:31,350
Now, Tieguanyin wants to secretly make

239
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,500
a lot of money with us.

240
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,820
How could he not feel jealous?

241
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,310
If we can get Congtou

242
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,120
to go against Tieguanyin,

243
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,270
then he won't be aware

244
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,470
of the danger lurking behind.

245
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,420
Whether we win or lose,

246
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,000
it will depend on you tomorrow night.

247
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:52,690
There was a girl whom I liked first.

248
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,330
[He knew everything.]

249
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,270
[He knew that I liked her.]

250
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,570
[But he wanted to take her from me.]

251
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:03,470
Honey, wait a minute.

252
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,840
Hey.

253
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,980
Here.

254
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,520
Come on. Here.

255
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,900
[Nothing is coming out.]

256
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:14,960
[Honey.]

257
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,230
[You're too tired.]

258
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,520
[I'm going to take a shower.]

259
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:19,530
Lily.

260
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:24,550
I'm heartbroken.

261
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,740
I just want to talk to someone.

262
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,630
I'll still give you money.

263
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,260
I'll give you as much as you want.

264
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:36,160
Honey, it's not because of money.

265
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,920
I'm very rich.

266
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,500
But aside from money,

267
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,190
I have nothing else.

268
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:49,930
[No family or friends.]

269
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,380
[Now, even my best friend left me.]

270
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,940
[Honey, you still have me.]

271
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:02,250
Do you think of me as a family?

272
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,570
That's right.

273
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,920
Thank you.

274
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,510
[But he doesn't think so.]

275
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,800
[Not everyone thinks like that.]

276
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,790
[In his heart,]

277
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,650
money matters more than anything.

278
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,110
He went behind my back.

279
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,920
He did all the dirty stuff behind my back.

280
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,770
[Honey.]

281
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,500
[You might have misunderstood him.]

282
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,700
Misunderstood?

283
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:31,070
That's right.

284
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,410
I'm thinking...

285
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,630
It probably is...

286
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:45,550
Honey.

287
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,390
Honey.

288
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:51,750
Honey.

289
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,790
That was good.

290
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,460
I didn't even do anything.

291
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,050
He said everything out himself.

292
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,380
Are you sure

293
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,050
he didn't notice anything suspicious?

294
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,210
No, don't worry.

295
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:45,560
You're not allowed to tell this to anyone.

296
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,660
I got it.

297
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,800
Thank you.

298
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:51,810
Lily.

299
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,970
You know what to do.

300
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,640
Don't worry.

301
00:17:55,730 --> 00:17:56,610
I'm leaving.

302
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,490
Mr. Congtou.

303
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,620
Should we figure out a way to tell Mr. Ou?

304
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,590
This is a huge thing.

305
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,700
We should think carefully.

306
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,030
Yes.

307
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,330
Hello.

308
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,230
He didn't say anything.

309
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,240
What should I do?

310
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,350
I'll think carefully

311
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,810
for the next step.

312
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:39,920
Wait for my call.

313
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,210
How was it?

314
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,630
We still have no idea

315
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,950
how Congtou will react.

316
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,040
It's unclear how he will react.

317
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,250
Could he have other thoughts?

318
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:00,510
In that case,

319
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,280
what should we do?

320
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,050
I'm Mr. Ou's cash cow.

321
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,590
If they want to hurt me,

322
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,840
they'll have to find my replacement.

323
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,430
It's still too dangerous.

324
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:13,750
I know it's dangerous.

325
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,400
We all know about Mr. Ou's card.

326
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,860
But none of them knows

327
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,400
about our card.

328
00:20:23,870 --> 00:20:24,840
Okay then.

329
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,420
Be careful.

330
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,620
I'll ask Director Liu
to coordinate with you.

331
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,810
If something comes up...

332
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,000
Initiate emergency protocol.

333
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,280
I know.

334
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,050
I'll consider it if I have to.

335
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,290
I'm leaving.

336
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,590
Remember to use the back door.

337
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,620
Don't forget that we're still not talking.

338
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,650
What now?

339
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,760
I have to sneak around to see you.

340
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,650
What did he mean by that?

341
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,940
Did he mean it's a pity?

342
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,050
It's a pity to me, not to you.

343
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:15,000
You're back, Mu Qing.

344
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,160
Guanyin, what are you doing here?

345
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:24,640
I want to have dinner with you.

346
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:26,530
Would that be okay?

347
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,900
Here, Guanyin.

348
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,010
Try it.

349
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,420
Not bad.

350
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,700
I didn't think you'd have the skills.

351
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,210
All of us hustlers

352
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,280
want to live a better life.

353
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,860
We need to learn how to cook.

354
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:45,490
Eat up, Guanyin.

355
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,740
It's delicious.

356
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:56,010
It's good.

357
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,510
Mu Qing.

358
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,450
Don't you want to ask me

359
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,870
why I came to your house?

360
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,670
You will tell me if you want to.

361
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,610
If you don't want to talk about it,

362
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:14,880
what's the point of asking?

363
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,010
My guys told me

364
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:20,290
that tonight,

365
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,670
Congtou and Li Ruosheng

366
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:25,130
were drinking at the bar.

367
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,250
What do you think

368
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,140
they were talking about?

369
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,540
I'm talking to you.

370
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,140
Don't you care at all?

371
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,050
Let's have a drink, Guanyin.

372
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:47,620
Sure.

373
00:22:58,530 --> 00:22:59,890
I'm so angry.

374
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,870
Mu Qing still hasn't picked up the phone?

375
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,470
That's right.

376
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,360
He's unbelievable.

377
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,770
Fighting is one thing,

378
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,930
but he still needs to take care
of things in the shop.

379
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,170
Guanyin will come to see me tomorrow.

380
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,370
Who should I ask
to get the clothing materials?

381
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,390
Tieguanyin is going to your shop tomorrow?

382
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,030
Yes.

383
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,350
She even said

384
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,940
she wanted to introduce someone to me

385
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,310
to help my business.

386
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:26,200
Who will she introduce?

387
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,520
Who knows?

388
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:29,810
Some Chinese guy from Thailand.

389
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,000
Who cares?

390
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,170
Tell me, Dad.

391
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,630
Mu Qing is not here. What should I do?

392
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,980
I have to eat this.

393
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,360
I'm talking to you.

394
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:51,720
Tell me.

395
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,790
Is Mu Qing holding a grudge against me

396
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,160
and making use of the situation?

397
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,270
How so?

398
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,630
The moment we fought,

399
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:00,920
he totally disappeared.

400
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,900
He didn't answer my calls or text me back.

401
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:04,400
I can't even see him.

402
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,160
He must have planned this out beforehand.

403
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,810
Mu Qing had also just found out

404
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,880
that she's working for Tieguanyin.

405
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,290
Don't tell me

406
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,740
it's a trap set by Tieguanyin.

407
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,690
Back then, people almost died

408
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,540
because of the two servers.

409
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:26,970
Now, they're getting along so well.

410
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,370
What are you thinking about?

411
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,310
How about this?

412
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,200
Tomorrow is Saturday.

413
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,910
I'm throwing a party at my house.

414
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,860
Call Mu Qing and Tieguanyin here.

415
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,550
Guanyin is a veteran.

416
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,040
Ask her for some advice.

417
00:24:59,350 --> 00:25:00,230
What do you think?

418
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:03,970
I'll do whatever you say.

419
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:06,920
Now, you listen to me.

420
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,130
Have some watermelon.

421
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,020
That's enough. I'll do it.

422
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,780
You're the sweetest, Dad.

423
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:17,790
The watermelon is sweet,

424
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,900
but you're sweeter, Dad.

425
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:44,850
Mu Qing.

426
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,110
Did you really break up with Ou Kexin?

427
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:53,160
She wouldn't believe me.

428
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,390
What can I do?

429
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,990
We were forced to be together anyway.

430
00:25:57,210 --> 00:25:58,880
A knot can't be sweet.

431
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,080
It's better to break up now than later.

432
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:02,490
In that case,

433
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,340
both of you have nothing to do

434
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,880
with each other anymore.

435
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,100
I'm just doing her a favor

436
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,160
for the studio at most.

437
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,310
I got it.

438
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,210
Here.

439
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,920
Cheers.

440
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,300
[But he doesn't think so.]

441
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,210
[Not everyone thinks like that.]

442
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,540
[In his heart,]

443
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,580
[money matters more than anything.]

444
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,070
[He went behind my back.]

445
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,800
[He did all the dirty stuff
behind my back.]

446
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,210
[Honey.]

447
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,020
[You might have misunderstood him.]

448
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,080
[No way.]

449
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,850
[That's impossible.]

450
00:26:51,990 --> 00:26:54,360
You're living a good life without me.

451
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,270
Okay.

452
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,440
I'll let you live happily ever after.

453
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,180
Hello, welcome.

454
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,340
Take your time.

455
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:20,900
Ladies' dresses are in the front.

456
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,880
Men's suits are at the back.

457
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,020
You can tell me

458
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:25,960
the style and material you want.

459
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,350
Are you Ms. Ou Kexin?

460
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,590
And you are...

461
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:38,190
My name is Huang Boyuan.

462
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,120
Guanyin sent me here.

463
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,630
The bankroller.

464
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:44,700
The bankroller?

465
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,680
I'm kidding.

466
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,260
Guanyin gave me the instructions.

467
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,890
Let me know if you need anything.

468
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,740
Sure.

469
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,910
The men's suits are in the back.

470
00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,110
This one.

471
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,260
I like this style.

472
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,730
That's a lady's dress.

473
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:04,810
What about the size?

474
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,140
The size...

475
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:10,130
Just follow your size.

476
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,090
Mr. Huang, are you kidding?

477
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,290
Women hate it if their men

478
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,090
have their clothes tailored

479
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,330
based on other women's sizes.

480
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,380
I think

481
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:22,230
you should go back and ask her first.

482
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:24,780
I think you're right.

483
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,640
But I think it's rude

484
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:30,060
to ask a woman her size

485
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,230
when I'm meeting her for the first time.

486
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,030
That's right.

487
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,710
But there's a technique to it.

488
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,950
Women like shopping.

489
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,620
You can just bring her here.

490
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,030
You're right.

491
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,680
But it seems like I can't.

492
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,190
Why not?

493
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,920
Because that woman

494
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:53,650
is standing right in front of me.

495
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,110
Okay, Mr. Glasses.

496
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,870
I understand.

497
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:06,190
Ms. Ou is heartbroken.

498
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,430
I'm obliged to do so.

499
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,210
Okay, I'll see you later.

500
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,170
It's not like Mr. Ou

501
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,070
to be so restless.

502
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:26,210
Are you going later?

503
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,330
I'll pass, Guanyin.

504
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,520
You go ahead.

505
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:34,480
Why?

506
00:29:35,140 --> 00:29:37,030
Mr. Ou wants to test us.

507
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,100
I don't want to run into the gun.

508
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,700
Guanyin.

509
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,240
It's a matter

510
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,000
of licking blood on the tip of a knife.

511
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,220
We can't let the cat out of the bag.

512
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,940
Sir, please pull over.

513
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,920
Here you go, Mr. Huang.

514
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:21,160
What's your relationship with Guanyin?

515
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,480
Guanyin and my dad

516
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,800
are long-time good friends.

517
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:26,530
They're also running a business together.

518
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,640
Naturally, we're close.

519
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,380
What kind of business?

520
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,760
I'm not sure what kind of business it is.

521
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,910
I just got back from abroad.

522
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,610
What's wrong?

523
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,600
Is there a problem, Ms. Ou?

524
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,590
No. There's no problem.

525
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,850
It's my first time getting
custom-made clothes

526
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,300
from a stranger.

527
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,370
Not at all.

528
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,660
We're all friends with Guanyin.

529
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:01,990
But of course,

530
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:05,910
maybe it's a little abrupt to do so.

531
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,100
Are you sure you're here to make clothes?

532
00:31:11,450 --> 00:31:12,990
What else do you think

533
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,190
I'm here for?

534
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,310
Drop the act.

535
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,130
Do you really think you're that smart?

536
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,510
I'm okay.

537
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,010
I'm a graduate of MIT.

538
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:27,950
with a master's degree in biomedicine.

539
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,190
I'm smart enough.

540
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,000
Science and Engineering?

541
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,460
Go back and tell Guanyin.

542
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,830
Although I'm single,

543
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,510
I really can't go on a blind date.

544
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,610
Tell her to forget it.

545
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,250
I think if we don't go on a blind date,

546
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,110
we can be friends first.

547
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:48,890
Besides, we both studied abroad.

548
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:50,650
We'll have common topics.

549
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,510
From the moment I met you,

550
00:31:53,910 --> 00:31:55,230
I got a feeling

551
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,390
that you would be

552
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,640
a very easygoing friend.

553
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,290
And you'll be a perfect girlfriend.

554
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:09,350
The probability won't be less than 45%.

555
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:12,130
Forty-five is not that high.

556
00:32:13,230 --> 00:32:14,590
As expected from a man of science,

557
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,260
you can even calculate that probability.

558
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:18,370
Straightforward with no ulterior motives.

559
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,520
You'll be a good husband.

560
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,940
But you're not good boyfriend material.

561
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:23,920
Besides,

562
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,900
I studied in France.

563
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,850
You probably can't even speak French.

564
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:30,870
There's nothing in common.

565
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:36,900
Although I can't speak French,

566
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,180
I can understand the language.

567
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,440
Ms. Ou, how about this?

568
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,890
Give me a chance.

569
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,710
You'll gradually find

570
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,820
more and more of my strong points.

571
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,330
Even if we start

572
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,480
as friends.

573
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:54,630
Okay?

574
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:00,130
Mr. Mu, you're here.

575
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:01,490
Put it here.

576
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:03,690
I'll leave it here.

577
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:04,790
Okay.

578
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:07,700
I'm leaving.

579
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,280
Come back here.

580
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,480
Where are you going?

581
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,720
Why didn't you answer my calls?

582
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:16,320
I have a lot of things to do.

583
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,120
I can't always be around you.

584
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:19,400
I got it.

585
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,540
You just need to be

586
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:21,860
around Liu Qingqing, right?

587
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,620
My goodness.

588
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,590
Stop right there.

589
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:26,570
Come with me.

590
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,300
What now?

591
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,930
Just come as I ask.

592
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,690
I have a lot of things to do.

593
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,180
Let me introduce someone.

594
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,140
Let me introduce you.

595
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,430
Huang Boyuan, my new boyfriend.

596
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:42,410
This is Mu Qing.

597
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,080
He's my ex-boyfriend

598
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,710
and also an errand boy.

599
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,520
Hello.

600
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,080
What are you looking at?

601
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:54,120
He's handsome and well-educated.

602
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,080
He's...

603
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,760
Where did you graduate from?

604
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,250
MIT.

605
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,410
From MIT. Look at him.

606
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,560
Your family is doing business
with Guanyin, right?

607
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:05,640
He has both money and talent.

608
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:07,180
If you were half as decent as he is,

609
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,370
I wouldn't have dumped you.

610
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,790
Is that all?

611
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,210
I wish you happiness.

612
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,110
Take care.

613
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,449
Bye.

614
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:29,929
You're such a good woman,

615
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,909
but he doesn't appreciate you.

616
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:33,889
Why are you still unhappy?

617
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,199
How about this?

618
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,179
I'll buy you a meal,

619
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,340
so you can take it easy, okay?

620
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,840
Okay then.

621
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:51,010
Let me call my dad first.

622
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:54,260
So you're not coming back for dinner?

623
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:56,949
Everything is ready.

624
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,540
Okay.

625
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:00,550
Go and repay your favor.

626
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,650
We'll eat by ourselves.

627
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:05,920
Kexin isn't coming home for dinner either?

628
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,170
Who else isn't coming?

629
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,150
Tieguanyin will be here soon.

630
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,550
But Mu Qing can't make it.

631
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:13,270
What happened?

632
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,160
Mu Qing said

633
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,410
he doesn't want to see Kexin recently.

634
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,960
He'll come by in the evening to apologize.

635
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,760
I don't know what's going on with them.

636
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,610
Have you heard of the name "Huang Boyuan"?

637
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:29,950
No. He's...

638
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,620
Check it out.

639
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,040
The most important thing is

640
00:35:34,130 --> 00:35:35,710
how he is related to Tieguanyin.

641
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,920
What do you mean?

642
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:06,550
The boss wants to see you.

643
00:36:09,590 --> 00:36:10,560
The boss?

644
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,150
In this place,

645
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,260
who else can call himself "boss"?

646
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,420
Please.

647
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:35,500
Tell me.

648
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,230
It's not easy to get together.

649
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,120
But the two hosts are not here.

650
00:36:40,390 --> 00:36:42,020
What's the purpose of this meal now?

651
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,220
Sir.

652
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,590
We haven't seen each other
for a long time.

653
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,540
This is a rare opportunity to talk to you.

654
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,340
You're right.

655
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:53,760
It really has been so long.

656
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,230
Come to think of it,

657
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,160
we've been together

658
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,480
for more than a decade.

659
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,720
Yes.

660
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,830
I'll never forget it.

661
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,540
I came out of there 15 years ago.

662
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:10,130
I was penniless.

663
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,600
If you hadn't taken me in

664
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,660
and brought me into this business,

665
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,040
I couldn't imagine where I would be now.

666
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:18,800
I didn't thank you.

667
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,250
But I know it well.

668
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,550
You help me, I help you.

669
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:25,440
That's what affection is.

670
00:37:26,590 --> 00:37:28,080
Affection is important.

671
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,240
You're right. Affection is key.

672
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:34,370
Glasses, Dakun,

673
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,350
Congtou, and you.

674
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,070
Everybody says

675
00:37:38,330 --> 00:37:40,140
that you're my Four Vajras.

676
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,920
Glasses is overly cautious.

677
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,470
Dakun was hot-tempered.

678
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:50,390
Congtou looks smart,

679
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,020
but he's the most thoughtless.

680
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:53,910
As for you...

681
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:55,890
You're the smartest.

682
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:59,500
You're too kind. You flatter me, sir.

683
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:01,480
You complimented me so much today.

684
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:02,840
I'm getting nervous.

685
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,510
I don't even know what you mean.

686
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:06,100
Why are you so nervous?

687
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:07,460
I was just saying.

688
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:09,660
You're not just smart,

689
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,600
but you're also the most affectionate one.

690
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:14,850
Mu Qing and Kexin are fighting.

691
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,490
It's all thanks to you
for taking care of her.

692
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,470
I heard

693
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:22,200
that you introduced someone to her.

694
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:24,710
I have a friend

695
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,030
who came back from Thailand.

696
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,170
He's from a good family,

697
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:29,150
so I introduced him to Kexin.

698
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,090
Kexin can't forget about Mu Qing.

699
00:38:35,490 --> 00:38:36,460
So...

700
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,570
please take good care

701
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,900
of those two kids.

702
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:42,840
I'll do my best.

703
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:46,230
Have some tea. It's getting cold.

704
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:06,900
Tell me.

705
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,500
Who's your boss?

706
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:13,150
Where are you taking me?

707
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:17,820
Stop the car.

708
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:19,970
Stop the car.

709
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:24,020
Do you want to die?

710
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,400
Ruosheng.

711
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,510
Congtou.

712
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:29,740
Are you in the car?

713
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:33,960
Your two underlings

714
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,370
are so good at their job.

715
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,220
Don't make it hard for my men.

716
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:38,940
It's me.

717
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,060
I instructed them to bring you here.

718
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,380
All right.

719
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,230
If you're unhappy,

720
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,340
tell the driver to stop the car.

721
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,830
You're making the trick a bit too big.

722
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,590
Ruosheng.

723
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,400
I wouldn't dare lie to you.

724
00:39:56,930 --> 00:39:57,900
Come here.

725
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,790
Let's talk about something important.

726
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,200
Let's talk

727
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,090
about Mu Qing.

728
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,340
Okay.

729
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,670
I'll do as you say.

730
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,260
I'm sorry, buddy.

731
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,420
Congtou.

732
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,410
You're tired.

733
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:34,330
I guess you stayed up all night.

734
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:36,620
I'm not tired.

735
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,430
I was just scared

736
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,150
by what you did this morning.

737
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,090
Don't say that.

738
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,770
Is there anything else you're afraid of?

739
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:47,880
Congtou.

740
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,290
You asked me to come.

741
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,610
Let's get straight to the point.

742
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,550
I do want to deal with Mu Qing.

743
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,350
But I want to do it myself.

744
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,850
It's between us.

745
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:59,190
But why are you getting yourself involved?

746
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:04,600
My good buddy, Ruosheng.

747
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:07,370
I don't mean to judge you.

748
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:10,810
Sometimes, your temper

749
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:12,830
is too bad.

750
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,190
Have some tea, Guanyin.

751
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:30,170
I quote what Mr. Ou said.

752
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,470
"Please take care of Kexin and Mu Qing."

753
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:37,160
It's understandable if it's just Ou Kexin.

754
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:38,610
But it's sort of strange

755
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,470
to mention you as well.

756
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:49,570
