[Episode 19]

3
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:35,030
Come on, let's go. Hurry up!

4
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,220
Get ready. Hurry!

5
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,210
Get ready!

6
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,580
Attention, everyone.

7
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,120
Get ready, everyone.

8
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,610
The show will start in two minutes.

9
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,580
Move!

10
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,550
Come on, move!

11
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,520
Hurry up!

12
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,110
Here. Have a piece of gum.

13
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,520
It relieves stress.

14
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,320
Are you a model too?

15
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,320
I'm a modeling agent. I'm Linda.

16
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,480
I've been observing you.

17
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,890
You seem like a good catch.

18
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,820
Would you like to sign with me?

19
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,140
But I'm not...

20
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,170
You're not ready, right?

21
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:25,940
It's okay.

22
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,370
Good luck, young man.

23
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,510
You know Ms. Linda?

24
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,800
Do you know her too?

25
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,480
Don't you know she's a top modeling agent?

26
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,990
Many people want to sign with her company.

27
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,790
Did she ask you to sign with her?

28
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,470
You're so lucky.

29
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,060
With Ms. Ou and Ms. Linda's guidance,

30
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,220
it's hard not to be famous.

31
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,350
Ms. Linda.

32
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,810
Ms. Linda.

33
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,040
Ms. Guanyin.

34
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:12,880
At tonight's show,

35
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,570
even the most famous person

36
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,760
in Group K's here.

37
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,820
Do you see him?

38
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,020
The guy in the black suit

39
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,140
who's sitting in the first row.

40
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,010
Just get straight to the point.

41
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,900
Get him done for me.

42
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,230
He's very useful to me.

43
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,120
Don't forget.

44
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,900
I made you into a famous fashionista.

45
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,660
My big agent.

46
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:46,980
Yes.

47
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,230
Without you,

48
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,690
I would not be where I am today.

49
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,500
In that case,

50
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,970
I believe you won't let me down.

51
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,540
Am I right?

52
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,730
Sir, is that seat taken?

53
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,020
I don't think so.

54
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,210
Givenchy Play.

55
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,970
You have good taste, sir.

56
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,090
Thank you. You're beautiful.

57
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,870
Am I the pretty one

58
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,850
or are they the pretty ones?

59
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,350
Are you in a hurry?

60
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,659
Are all fashion shows this boring?

61
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:17,460
Are you in a bad mood?

62
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,730
Is it obvious?

63
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,430
It looks a little better now.

64
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,010
I'm going backstage. Wait for me.

65
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,010
Hi, I'm Linda.

66
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,210
I'm Li Ruosheng.

67
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:49,620
You're the first man
who took me away from the show.

68
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,490
What are you doing?

69
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,530
You know better than I do

70
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,480
about what I'm doing.

71
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,240
Ms. Linda.

72
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,830
-I'm so tired.
-Thank you.

73
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,930
Let me introduce you.

74
00:07:45,409 --> 00:07:47,830
This is my new friend, Mr. Li.

75
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,240
Your new friend?

76
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,310
These are my new models.

77
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,360
Hello.

78
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,000
Handsome, do you want to come with us?

79
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,250
Come on. Let's go together.

80
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,830
Okay, I'll do that.

81
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:04,070
Really?

82
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,340
That's great.

83
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:07,850
Come on.

84
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,080
Let's go.

85
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:17,880
Look at these.

86
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,260
-Let's have another drink.
-Sure.

87
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:21,230
Here.

88
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,030
Look at the table,
there's too much to eat.

89
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,750
Where are we going?

90
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,550
You'll see.

91
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,740
Is it a secret?

92
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,419
Fasten your seat belts.

93
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:54,840
Sir, follow that car.

94
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,890
There's nobody here.

95
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,380
He's not here either. It's strange.

96
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,840
I haven't seen him since the curtain call.

97
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,860
Where is he?

98
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,730
Maybe he got a girl.

99
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,090
Really?

100
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,910
It's true if you believe it.

101
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,380
So what now? Should we just leave?

102
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:24,890
Come on.

103
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,740
Come on.

104
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,650
Have some, Mr. Li.

105
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,780
Forget about your goods.

106
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,840
I have something good here.

107
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,200
Try it later.

108
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:03,960
Thank you, Mr. Li.

109
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,280
Thank you, Mr. Li.

110
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,600
You're welcome.

111
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,540
Come on, let's drink.

112
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,740
That's right. Come on.

113
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:48,710
Mr. Jiang.

114
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,250
You're playing again? Come in.

115
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:53,110
Ms. Linda. Is he your new friend?

116
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,060
[Here, drink this as punishment.]

117
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,390
[Drink it. What's going on?]

118
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,940
Hello.

119
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,320
Ms. Linda.

120
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,370
Greet Mr. Li.

121
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,740
Hello, Mr. Li.

122
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:10,000
Wait, don't rush for it.

123
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,440
Just drink your wine.

124
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,160
Let's taste your new goods.

125
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:35,040
I'm not an easy person.

126
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,060
But you ran into me.

127
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,080
Help. Somebody is drunk over there.

128
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,180
There's a risk of falling.

129
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,590
Falling? Where is it?

130
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,390
-Follow me.
-Come on.

131
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,110
It's too dangerous.

132
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,400
-Be careful!
-Don't go up there. Don't fall down.

133
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,760
-Be careful.
-It's too dangerous.

134
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:03,810
How is it?

135
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,490
-Don't jump!
-Be careful.

136
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,540
It's Unit 502.

137
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,550
Hurry up!

138
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,970
This is too dangerous.

139
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:10,990
Come down.

140
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:11,950
Come on.

141
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,860
Open the door!

142
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,170
Call the Drug Task Force now.

143
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,140
Yes.

144
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,810
Open the door!

145
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,460
Open the door!

146
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,500
Open the door! Come on!

147
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:41,830
Open the door!

148
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,280
Police! Open the door!

149
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,360
The police are here! Run!

150
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,730
Hurry up. Let's go!

151
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,050
Let's go. Come on.

152
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:50,230
-Police.
-You.

153
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,450
I think the police are here.

154
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,950
Run!

155
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:57,630
Hurry up and go!

156
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,060
Hurry up!

157
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:13,380
Don't move!

158
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,700
Come on. Good job.

159
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,820
Search the place.
Don't leave anyone behind.

160
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:19,620
-Yes.
-You, come here.

161
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,290
There's a freight elevator
that leads to the parking lot.

162
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,380
Listen carefully, Ruosheng.

163
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,920
Find a place to hide first.

164
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,160
Otherwise, even God can't save you. Okay?

165
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,930
What's wrong?

166
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:54,650
Is he in trouble?

167
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,670
Make a U-turn there.

168
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,360
Okay.

169
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,150
Let's go.

170
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,970
-Go inside.
-Yes.

171
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:08,240
Hurry up.

172
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:09,740
Here it is.

173
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,840
-Go back.
-Come on.

174
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,200
Get down! Hurry up!

175
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,340
Get down.

176
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,200
Chin up!

177
00:14:19,990 --> 00:14:21,000
Is anyone else over there?

178
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:21,970
No.

179
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,710
I called the police first.

180
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:41,810
But he was the one

181
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,490
who found that girl was about to fall.

182
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:45,250
Do you live here?

183
00:14:45,330 --> 00:14:46,480
Or were you just passing by?

184
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,890
I don't live here.

185
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,470
I'm just looking for someone.

186
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,440
Who?

187
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:54,350
Her name is Linda.

188
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,990
She's an agent
at Longteng Modeling Agency.

189
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,930
She wants me to be their model.

190
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,100
Is she upstairs too?

191
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,650
Well, I don't know.

192
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,510
The majority of the suspects are models.

193
00:15:07,770 --> 00:15:09,800
One of them just went to a fashion show.

194
00:15:10,190 --> 00:15:11,510
Some of them

195
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,920
are from the same modeling agency.

196
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,990
It's a company called
Longteng Modeling Agency.

197
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,790
This condominium is registered

198
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,420
under Longteng Modeling Agency.

199
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,580
Linda is their agent.

200
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,080
Is Linda one of them?

201
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,230
No.

202
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,820
But the person who called the police
said that she should be here.

203
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:28,140
Where is she now?

204
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:33,730
Linda.

205
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,520
[Attention, all units.
Pursue two fugitives.]

206
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,700
[A woman in her mid-20s,]

207
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,200
[wearing a red suit.]

208
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:41,560
[A man in his mid-20s,]

209
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,590
[about 178cm tall, wearing a black suit.]

210
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,860
Is anyone in there?

211
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:50,140
There's no one here either.

212
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,040
Turn around and park the car.

213
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,010
I'll be right back.

214
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:32,090
Be safe.

215
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:25,020
Wait.

216
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,310
Zoom in.

217
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,590
-Are you okay?
-I'm suffocating.

218
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,100
Are you okay?

219
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,200
What are you doing?

220
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:12,450
Get in the car.

221
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:22,880
What are you looking at?

222
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,470
Get in.

223
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:38,280
I'll drive.

224
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:52,930
This car is no longer safe.

225
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,290
My car is just up ahead.

226
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,510
Where are you going?

227
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,110
They will catch up soon.

228
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,920
I don't want to be a burden to you.

229
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,950
We went through so much to save you.

230
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,620
Are you going to let yourself get caught?

231
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,200
Where are you going?

232
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,580
The police are searching the city.

233
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,210
Leave when it's safe, okay?

234
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,230
Come with us.

235
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:34,770
Hurry.

236
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,040
Right.

237
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,800
The situation was urgent just now,

238
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,480
so I forgot to introduce everyone.

239
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:15,560
The one driving the car is my best friend,

240
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,570
Mu Qing.

241
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,940
And this is Ms. Linda,

242
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:20,480
the famous model agent.

243
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,390
Let me introduce this person formally.

244
00:21:23,650 --> 00:21:25,940
She's both pretty and talented...

245
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,000
I'm Ou Kexin.

246
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,110
I've discussed it with Mu Qing.

247
00:21:29,550 --> 00:21:31,750
Let's go to my studio now.

248
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,560
I think that's the safest place.

249
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,420
Thank you, Ms. Ou.

250
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:49,350
You're Linda now.

251
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:53,130
Why are you here?

252
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,200
You two know each other?

253
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,080
We are old acquaintances.

254
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,630
Old acquaintances?

255
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:20,980
I only have one bedroom.

256
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,570
So tonight,

257
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,240
both of you will have to stay here.

258
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:27,140
It's okay.
It will last a few nights at most.

259
00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:28,370
We'll leave when it's over.

260
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,320
Linda, sit down.

261
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,310
You stink.

262
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,630
Get your jacket clean.

263
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,100
There was no garbage in that trash can.

264
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,070
It doesn't smell.

265
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,390
Go.

266
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,260
Okay, I'll go and take a shower.

267
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,340
Leave it for Linda to use.

268
00:22:47,430 --> 00:22:48,530
You use the public one.

269
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:49,800
It's cold water.

270
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,560
Should Linda go then?

271
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,750
Are you going or not?

272
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:55,480
Sure.

273
00:23:01,730 --> 00:23:03,790
You can take off your clothes.
I'll wash them for you.

274
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:06,260
Thank you, but it's fine.

275
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:08,370
Make yourself at home.

276
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:10,040
I'll get you some pajamas.

277
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,090
If you don't want to see me,

278
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,510
I can leave right now.

279
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,590
I didn't say that.

280
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,020
I disappointed you.

281
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,840
I never thought I'd turn out this way.

282
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,600
You have your own path. I don't care.

283
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,500
Thank you for saving me again.

284
00:23:53,730 --> 00:23:56,370
I'm sorry. I only saved my friend today.

285
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:24,570
[Wait.]

286
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,730
[Zoom in.]

287
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,170
You can tell me now.

288
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,280
How did you and Linda know each other?

289
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,120
I'm curious too.

290
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:04,660
Tell me about it.

291
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,980
How did you two know each other?

292
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,240
[When I met her,]

293
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,470
[her name was not Linda.]

294
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,700
[Her name was Liu Qingqing.]

295
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:16,980
[Drink.]

296
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:19,220
[Cheers!]

297
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,330
One more.

298
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,220
-No.
-Hurry.

299
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,240
Drink up.

300
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,040
Okay.

301
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,160
Drink the whole bottle. Here.

302
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,480
Take a sip. Come on. Hurry up.

303
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,670
Hurry up. Drink a bottle.

304
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,170
Here, drink this.

305
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,490
No!

306
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,160
You don't like beer?

307
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:37,440
Get some action, come on.

308
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,340
-Here.
-This is good. Eat this.

309
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,580
[You won't get drunk.]

310
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,630
Have another one. Hurry.

311
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,640
-It's okay.
-Come on.

312
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:48,740
Have one.

313
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,930
It's very sweet.

314
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,520
Here.

315
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,190
[Have one.]

316
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,480
[Have one. Come on. Hurry up.]

317
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,060
-Let me go.
-Hold her.

318
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,130
Have one.

319
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,100
Hurry up and eat.

320
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,550
Have one.

321
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:02,820
It dropped.

322
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,670
Open your mouth.

323
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,860
Yes, put it in her mouth.

324
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,050
Come on. Yes.

325
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,370
Pry the teeth up.

326
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,470
It won't budge.

327
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,050
-Open your mouth.
-Come on.

328
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,150
Open your mouth. Come on.

329
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,010
What are you looking at? Get lost!

330
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,610
Get lost!

331
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,580
You want to run away?

332
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,130
Swallow it. Come on.

333
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,280
Okay. Push it in.

334
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,210
I'm not eating it!

335
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:34,810
You want to run?

336
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,030
Here, girl.

337
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:50,170
Come on!

338
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,270
Sir.

339
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:09,880
What a beautiful love story.

340
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,160
What are you talking about?

341
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,880
That's touching.

342
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,340
That's a good thing.
I didn't mean anything by it.

343
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,800
You see, I used to suspect

344
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,120
there's someone in your heart.

345
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,460
Isn't she here now?

346
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,620
What are you talking about?

347
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,850
Don't make excuses.

348
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,120
I have another question.

349
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,730
Why is it that all the women I'm with

350
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,760
are related to you?

351
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,840
Li Ruosheng, what do you mean by that?

352
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,890
Are you going to sleep?

353
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,340
Get out if you don't want to sleep.

354
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,400
I'll sleep.

355
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:40,900
I'll sleep right away.

356
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:11,210
Did something happen?

357
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,570
I'm fine.

358
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:13,890
Do you need help?

359
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,990
I don't need help.

360
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:26,700
All right, go to sleep.

361
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,260
Li Yimeng.

362
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,550
Why are you here at this hour?

363
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,050
I'm on duty.

364
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,240
What shift are you on?

365
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,820
Aren't Zhao Ran and I on duty tonight?

366
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,440
Zhao Ran said he had an emergency.

367
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,550
He asked me to take over his shift.
It's so annoying.

368
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,030
Captain Rong.

369
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,920
You haven't had dinner?

370
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:51,350
I happen to have some food here.
Do you want to join me?

371
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:55,580
No, you eat it. I'll eat instant noodles.

372
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,040
Okay.

373
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,240
I don't know what people are thinking.

374
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:07,230
Instant noodles are not nutritious.

375
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,600
It's all preservatives.

376
00:30:08,990 --> 00:30:11,020
It doesn't benefit your health at all.

377
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,350
Do you think I want to eat with him?

378
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:14,800
I ordered a lot of food.

379
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:15,900
I don't want to waste it.

380
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,910
That's enough.

381
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:17,930
If you say that,

382
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:20,130
how can I eat my instant noodles?

383
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,560
I'll eat your food.

384
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,900
I thought you didn't want it.

385
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,490
I want to eat it. I really do.

386
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:30,250
Yimeng, I'm begging you. Let me eat, okay?

387
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:31,390
Please?

388
00:30:31,870 --> 00:30:33,590
Since you're begging me,

389
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,350
I'll allow it.

390
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,040
Chopsticks.

391
00:30:48,150 --> 00:30:49,080
Here.

392
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:53,830
Are you not eating?

393
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:57,260
I'm not hungry yet. You go ahead.

394
00:30:57,830 --> 00:30:58,710
I'll eat it then.

395
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:03,820
Is it good?

396
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,560
It's good. Which takeout place?

397
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:09,320
Li's Takeout.

398
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,030
Others can't eat it even if they want to.

399
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,660
Which one is Li's Takeout?

400
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,540
This Li's Takeout.

401
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:20,840
You cooked this?

402
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,570
It's delicious.

403
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,480
Were you a chef before you became a cop?

404
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,780
Do you think women like me

405
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,230
who are good at cooking

406
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,720
and solving cases

407
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,000
are very outstanding?

408
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,200
Yes, outstanding.

409
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:38,750
Thank you.

410
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:40,780
I should be the one thanking you.

411
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,370
What for?

412
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,360
You did a good job in rescuing Zhao Nan.

413
00:31:47,380 --> 00:31:48,560
A while ago,

414
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:51,030
I was unstable and I had a bad temper.

415
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:52,520
Not only did you not blame me,

416
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,710
but you also comforted me.

417
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,770
Don't mention it. We're comrades.

418
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,500
Whether it was Zhao Nan or someone else,

419
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,700
we should do our best in our job.

420
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,160
We should make sacrifices, right?

421
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:07,530
What sacrifices?

422
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,850
Don't ever say that again.

423
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,960
I'll stop. I'll eat.

424
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:13,790
Good morning.

425
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,280
You're awake.

426
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:16,960
Go wash up and have breakfast.

427
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,680
I didn't know you could make breakfast.

428
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,490
What a coincidence.

429
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:22,940
Where's Linda?

430
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:24,920
She's still sleeping.

431
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,220
Why don't you ask where Mu Qing is?

432
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,960
It's none of my business.

433
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,370
I don't know either.

434
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,570
He went out early in the morning.

435
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:43,880
He can go wherever he wants.

436
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,090
Through our tests,

437
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:54,850
this batch of newly seized drugs

438
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,909
matches the specimens.

439
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:57,800
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

440
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:00,970
The source of the drug

441
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,950
and the source we've been looking for

442
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,310
match with each other.

443
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,830
So the one who sells the drugs

444
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:08,840
to the models

445
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:10,600
is extremely important.

446
00:35:14,430 --> 00:35:15,580
Most of the confessions

447
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,780
point towards the agent, Linda.

448
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,980
An agent has that much power?

449
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,120
That's not true.

450
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:22,920
For drug selling,

451
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:25,120
all the front stage actors
are not important.

452
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,980
The deeper the water, the bigger the fish.

453
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,350
So Linda is the key

454
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:31,370
to solving this case.

455
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,000
Yes.

456
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,800
What do you think?

457
00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:38,720
Look at you.

458
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,480
The breakfast is okay.

459
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:43,250
My biggest wish

460
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,890
is to make breakfast
for the woman I love every day.

461
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,210
Different recipes in 900 days.

462
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,580
But so far,

463
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,780
only Mu Qing has eaten it.

464
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:53,060
He doesn't know how lucky he is.

465
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,920
Why don't you make it for the dog instead?

466
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:58,740
At least the dog will wag its tail.

467
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,470
What a waste to cook for him.

468
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:04,150
I don't remember adding vinegar
to the food.

469
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:05,960
Why does it taste so sour?

470
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:06,920
Eat up.

471
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,020
I'm not eating. Dig in.

472
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:08,990
I don't eat breakfast.

473
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:10,350
You touched it. I don't want it.

474
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,450
You don't like me?

475
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,550
Linda is up. Come have breakfast.

476
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:17,970
I'm not eating.
I'm just telling you that I'm leaving.

477
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,350
What's wrong?

478
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:23,160
It's dangerous to be out there now.

479
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,240
It's okay. I know what I'm doing.

480
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,470
Mu Qing isn't here.

481
00:36:27,870 --> 00:36:29,800
If he doesn't see you when he comes back,

482
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,080
what should we tell him?

483
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,600
Mu Qing already told me

484
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,960
how you two met.

485
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,350
As a woman,

486
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:42,610
I can tell that something is going on.

487
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,310
It's between you two women.

488
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:51,320
I won't interfere.

489
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,050
I'm going out.

490
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,260
You can tell me

491
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:02,490
if you have any difficulties.

492
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,590
We'll help you.

493
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:14,640
Mu Qing shouldn't have saved me,

494
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,570
not even now.

495
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,210
He saved the wrong person.

496
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,500
I'm the one who gave up on myself.

497
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,020
But this is my life.

498
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,400
That's my situation.

499
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,680
If you're not willing to tell me,

500
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,140
how can you be so sure we won't help you?

501
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,330
It's not that easy.

502
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,640
Your raid was a huge success.

503
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,920
You've been a great leader.

504
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,960
We caught many drug addicts.

505
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,420
But there's no breakthrough on the case.

506
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,540
I didn't do much.

507
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:01,630
You can't rush it.

508
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,050
I have a suggestion.

509
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,820
In the next phase,

510
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,450
you should mainly focus

511
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:10,780
on coordinating with Yuanwen's operation.

512
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,050
But you're well aware.

513
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:14,300
My main mission in Yungang

514
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,450
is to catch the transnational
drug lord, Spectre.

515
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:17,860
Spectre hasn't appeared.

516
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,310
How do you catch him?

517
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,130
You've analyzed it.

518
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:24,950
If Spectre shows up at Yungang,

519
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:27,230
then he must be here to meet Mr. Ou.

520
00:38:28,730 --> 00:38:29,700
Rong Yao.

521
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:32,510
You, Task Force 84, and other comrades

522
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,450
can discuss among yourselves

523
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,170
if anything happens.

524
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,880
But Yuanwen

525
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,870
can be isolated anytime.

526
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:43,160
So I want you

527
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,270
to work with him,

528
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:48,570
so that he can do better

529
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,550
in completing his own task

530
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:54,030
to contact and find Spectre.

531
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,150
I understand.

532
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,690
[Last night, we intercepted]

533
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,190
[the drugs and the people.]

534
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:02,040
[All the clues]

535
00:39:02,130 --> 00:39:03,970
[point towards the modeling agent, Linda.]

536
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,370
Are you sure?

537
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:09,560
Most likely.

538
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,240
I also talked to Rong Yao today.

539
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,150
At this stage,
he will fully cooperate with you.

540
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,830
Send my regards to Rong Yao.

541
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,940
[I believe one day,]

542
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,400
[we can sit down and have a drink.]

543
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:23,020
I hope so too.

544
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,940
You're back.

545
00:39:53,470 --> 00:39:54,570
Why are you outside?

546
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,330
I'm waiting for you.

547
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:58,880
We can't talk because someone is inside.

548
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,520
Linda was going to leave today.

549
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,250
I tried so hard to make her stay.

550
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,370
There's also this.

551
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:11,030
I found it in the bathroom.

552
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:12,960
Linda used it.

553
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,990
I got it. I'll call Director Liu later.

554
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:31,660
It seems Linda's feelings...

555
00:40:33,110 --> 00:40:35,970
Your relationship with her

556
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,530
doesn't seem as simple as you said.

557
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:43,150
Yes.

558
00:40:44,290 --> 00:40:45,350
Our relationship

559
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,150
is complicated.

560
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,710
Why did you say that?

561
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,070
I was just kidding.

562
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,580
I was joking too.
