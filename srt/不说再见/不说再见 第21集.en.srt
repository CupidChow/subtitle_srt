[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,789
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,750
Although this is business,

4
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:39,120
we still need to build friendship, right?

5
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,620
However,

6
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,740
for so many items,

7
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,500
this sincerity

8
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,700
isn't enough.

9
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:54,960
Isn't money the problem then?

10
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,280
That's easy.

11
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:58,350
Let's reschedule the meeting.

12
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,650
I'll bring you the rest of my money.

13
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:05,350
[At the same time, sincerity is mutual.]

14
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,620
Attention.
Someone is at the door listening.

15
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,480
I need to know your real strength.

16
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,360
As long as what you
and Xiaochang said is true,

17
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,990
I'll pay...

18
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:24,180
What are you looking at?

19
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,590
You've never seen a woman?

20
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,140
Are you crazy?

21
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:29,420
I wasn't looking.

22
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,520
You were looking at her the whole time.

23
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,660
Do you think I didn't see it?

24
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,800
Explain this to me.

25
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,120
Explain this to me!

26
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,180
What are you two doing?

27
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,020
-Where is he?
-He went to the left.

28
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:45,470
Block all exits.

29
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,230
Turn right at the end.

30
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,150
I'm sorry about that.

31
00:02:58,630 --> 00:02:59,770
We just...

32
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:03,250
As long as what you
and Xiaochang said is true,

33
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:05,320
I'll pay half in advance if you want.

34
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,750
Mr. Zhao.

35
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,830
I'll tell my boss about your sincerity.

36
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,770
We'll meet again soon.

37
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:15,000
Don't worry.

38
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,650
Okay.

39
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,020
We'll meet again.

40
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,540
Mr. Zhao.

41
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,310
Your people are all excellent.

42
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,800
I'm really sorry.

43
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,200
He went out the back door.

44
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:53,320
[Mr. Bao, take some men to the back door.]

45
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,640
Got it.

46
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,150
Xiaochang, go to the back door.

47
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,950
This way.

48
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,510
Where is he?

49
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,870
We didn't see him.

50
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,240
Did we lose him?

51
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,490
We lost him.

52
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,010
Retreat.

53
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,420
But...

54
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,970
Let's go.

55
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,150
Find a way to succeed.

56
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,090
Don't find excuses for failure.

57
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,160
Find a way to succeed.

58
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,180
Don't find excuses for failure.

59
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,040
Let's go!

60
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,930
What are you doing here?

61
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,500
It's nothing, ma'am.

62
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,590
I'm just passing by.

63
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,380
Let's go! I'm the strongest!

64
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,960
Let's go! I'm the best!

65
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,550
Go on.

66
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,750
Find a way to succeed.

67
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,420
Don't find excuses for failure.

68
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,320
You were being watched?

69
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,430
Have you identified him?

70
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,890
I checked the footage.

71
00:05:29,810 --> 00:05:30,690
It was Li Ruosheng.

72
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,030
Did Mr. Ou find out about something?

73
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:39,270
So he sent Li Ruosheng there?

74
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,430
I don't think that's likely.

75
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,320
Firstly,

76
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,250
with Liu Qingqing's confidentiality,

77
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,409
she wouldn't let anyone else know

78
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,909
about our meeting.

79
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:51,940
But he showed up at the scene.

80
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:54,230
If Mr. Ou sent him,

81
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:56,390
that would mean he knew about the meeting.

82
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,150
Then he would've done more

83
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,550
than just stalking us.

84
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,460
According to this logic,

85
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,010
Yuanwen must have set this up.

86
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:07,390
But if they planned this,

87
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,750
they should report in advance.

88
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,700
It could be due to the circumstances

89
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:13,720
that they couldn't tell us.

90
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,850
Contact them.

91
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,530
Make sure that they're safe.

92
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:22,130
Find out what their plan is.

93
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,620
Yes.

94
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,470
I got it.

95
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:31,230
Why did Li Ruosheng follow them?

96
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,870
I sent him.

97
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:35,500
I didn't expect this to happen.

98
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,490
Then...

99
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,470
Did he see Rong Yao?

100
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,159
That's possible.

101
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,840
How about this?

102
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,340
I'll go back and check him out.

103
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,700
Tell Rong Yao.

104
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:50,240
About our next step,

105
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:52,040
let's decide after we discuss it.

106
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:08,720
I was working my backside off out there.

107
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,350
You're here playing games.

108
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,490
That's cool.

109
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,900
Hurry and sit.

110
00:07:13,380 --> 00:07:14,970
-Play with me.
-Let's do it.

111
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:21,880
Wait a minute.

112
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,860
Do you think I'll be negligent?

113
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,790
Is that why you're here?

114
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,970
Did you find anything?

115
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,350
I found nothing.

116
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,620
But I saw her dealing

117
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:34,900
with a bunch of outsiders.

118
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,500
Outsiders?

119
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,340
It was a man.

120
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,370
I heard them call him Mr. Zhao.

121
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,610
His accent sounds Eastern.

122
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,900
He was with a man and a woman.

123
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,230
They also said other things,

124
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,990
but I didn't hear them

125
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,620
because the guy noticed me.

126
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,600
You had no idea. He chased after me.

127
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,350
But the guy looks familiar somehow.

128
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,390
Have you seen him before?

129
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,510
I've been trying to figure it out.

130
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:05,650
I really don't know.

131
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:07,280
I feel like I've seen him.

132
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,910
Maybe I got it wrong.

133
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,490
-Stop it.
-What's wrong?

134
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:15,070
Have you ever seen this person or not?

135
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,210
This is important.

136
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,360
How important can it be?

137
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,870
I told you that I can't remember.

138
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,890
You know that I'm slow sometimes.

139
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,990
I forget people.

140
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,710
Maybe I know his face, but not his name.

141
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,290
Or I know his name, but not his face.

142
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,710
I'll tell you if I know, all right?

143
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,160
Hurry up.

144
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,049
We died.

145
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,429
Gosh.

146
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,710
Hurry up. Follow me.

147
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,159
Don't get too far away.

148
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,789
No wonder you died.

149
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,420
So Li Ruosheng didn't recognize me?

150
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,630
[But he thinks you look familiar.]

151
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,480
How familiar?

152
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:54,850
He said that

153
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,430
he doesn't remember where he saw you.

154
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,690
[But I still think it's a problem.]

155
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:03,430
If we continue tracking down Liu Qingqing,

156
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,100
it could be dangerous.

157
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,640
We should find someone else.

158
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,910
That won't work.

159
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,280
Liu Qingqing is alerted.

160
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,520
If we switch now, she'll be suspicious.

161
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,930
I don't agree.

162
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,490
I mean...

163
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:19,530
[Maybe we can find another way.]

164
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,500
Don't worry.

165
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,170
I already have a plan.

166
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,260
What is your plan?

167
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,800
Yuanwen.

168
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,650
Pull Li Ruosheng out for now.

169
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,660
After I find out

170
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,020
who's behind Liu Qingqing,

171
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,390
you can send him out.

172
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,280
Skylark, coordinate with Yuanwen

173
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,560
and stall Li Ruosheng.

174
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,400
Leave the rest to me.

175
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,650
Are you still going to do it?

176
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,510
It's our mission. It must be done.

177
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,090
It's too risky.

178
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,820
Can you give me and Mu Qing more time?

179
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:49,890
Maybe we can find a better way.

180
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,340
We don't have time.

181
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,750
That's the only way.

182
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,220
Okay. Be careful.

183
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,100
Let's do that.

184
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:23,460
[Feel free to look around.]

185
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,100
Hello.

186
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,630
You're jogging too?

187
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,600
In our last mission,

188
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,800
you and Zhao Ran played

189
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:18,850
the "good cop, bad cop."

190
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,260
You acted well.

191
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,270
Thumbs up for you.

192
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,910
Zhao Ran had a great script.

193
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,450
I just went along with it.

194
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,310
In a team,

195
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,040
coordination is progress.

196
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,540
No.

197
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,050
It's a huge step forward.

198
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,470
What are you trying to say?

199
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,180
Was that a compliment or not?

200
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,030
What do you think?

201
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,430
I was quite nervous actually.

202
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,790
I was afraid of making mistakes.

203
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,420
I didn't expect

204
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,270
that you'd be quick-witted.

205
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,740
You gave me a hint.

206
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,910
That's not enough.

207
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,070
But you understood me.

208
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,550
Well, as a qualified

209
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,600
Public Security officer,

210
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:10,240
we must always have a strong heart

211
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,700
and lucid mind.

212
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,370
That's how

213
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,350
we complete our mission efficiently.

214
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:18,910
Am I right?

215
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,410
That's right.

216
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,440
Why are you running so fast?

217
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,670
Wait for me.

218
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,620
Come on.

219
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,160
Rong Yao.

220
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:34,180
Stop right there!

221
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,890
But by doing this,

222
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,000
you're in danger of being exposed.

223
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,420
Even if it's dangerous,

224
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:45,000
I need to make sure

225
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:46,240
that our people are safe.

226
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,660
Therefore,

227
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,330
I'll leave it to you

228
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,520
to stall Li Ruosheng.

229
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:56,880
Okay.

230
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,170
I'll find a way to stall him.

231
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,810
You need to be careful.

232
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,710
You still don't trust my capability?

233
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,030
Don't worry.

234
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,330
[It's my fault.]

235
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,870
[I let him run away.]

236
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,900
What's the point of saying that now?

237
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,020
That's not the issue.

238
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,890
The problem is we might be exposed.

239
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,180
Even if we are,

240
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,340
we still have to track Liu Qingqing.

241
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,800
I don't believe

242
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,740
that she won't contact her boss.

243
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,010
I'm sure she will.

244
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,940
But we still don't know

245
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,750
how many phones she has.

246
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,300
How do we track her?

247
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,110
Just as we finally got something...

248
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,970
All right, guys.

249
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:15,550
Stay focus.

250
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,370
Liu Qingqing just called us.

251
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,000
Our next meeting

252
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,490
is at Wenhua Grand Hotel,

253
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,740
room 823, at 3 p.m.

254
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,680
So we need to get ready now.

255
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,310
Let's catch them red-handed.

256
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:29,590
What?

257
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,400
Did I hear you correctly?

258
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,080
You're doing it for me?

259
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,100
Yes, I'll do it for you.

260
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,070
You don't have to go.

261
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,870
Just stay at home and rest.

262
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,100
I got it.

263
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,660
You think I've been working too hard.

264
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,280
That's why you feel sorry for me.

265
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,740
You've gained conscience, right?

266
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,280
Look at you.

267
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,080
Can't you accept my kindness?

268
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,090
Of course.

269
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,060
Thank you, sir.

270
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:52,030
I'm going.

271
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,450
Thank you. I'll take the day off then.

272
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:04,080
Li Ruosheng.

273
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,670
Where is Mu Qing going?

274
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,210
He has things to do.

275
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,060
What things?

276
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,230
Not with other women.

277
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,400
You bought a lot of meat.

278
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,770
Did Mu Qing tell you it's my day off?

279
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,970
Is that why you bought these to reward me?

280
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,120
Take it.

281
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,920
Thank you.

282
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:28,720
You're so lucky.

283
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,440
Please.

284
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,320
My goodness.

285
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,180
All right.

286
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,290
Right now, we're at Wenhua Grand Hotel.

287
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,790
Everyone, line up here.

288
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,020
Get your luggage.

289
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,390
Do a head count.

290
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,670
Everyone, follow my lead.

291
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,510
Check in at the lobby.

292
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,480
This way.

293
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,390
Plug it in.

294
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,090
You two, on high ground.

295
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,140
You two, the perimeter.

296
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,200
-Go now.
-Yes, sir.

297
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,940
-How is it?
-We can hear you.

298
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,660
The video and audio are clear.

299
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:03,940
Okay.

300
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:05,480
Call it if you see the goods.

301
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,490
Got it.

302
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:17,839
Hello?

303
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,200
I'm on my way.

304
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,390
What are you doing?

305
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,619
[Skylark and I]

306
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:22,990
[are worried about your safety.]

307
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:24,880
[So she's stalling Li Ruosheng.]

308
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,730
I'll be on the lookout.

309
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,750
We have two dozen officers here.

310
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,510
What's the point of coming alone?

311
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,370
Let's hope you won't need me.

312
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,330
I'm hanging up.

313
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,640
Where's Liu Qingqing?

314
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,020
[Are you Mr. Zhao?]

315
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,970
[I am.]

316
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:15,700
Take them out. We need to check them.

317
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:18,870
You should be nicer.

318
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:24,100
Our deal was made
with Liu Qingqing's boss.

319
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,470
Are you the boss?

320
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,310
That was the deal,

321
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,720
but not here.

322
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,620
[You might not understand.]

323
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,780
[Mr. Zhao wishes to meet]

324
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,010
[with Liu Qingqing's boss.]

325
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,510
If her boss is not here,

326
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,090
we won't give you the money.

327
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,140
Fine, let's go.

328
00:18:50,150 --> 00:18:51,690
Guys, you're already here.

329
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,010
Do you have to do this?

330
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,950
Can't you just check it?

331
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,000
Hold on.

332
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,970
You should've done that sooner.

333
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,470
Remember this.

334
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,240
We make the rules.

335
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,700
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhao.

336
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,230
It's my phone.

337
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,810
What is this?

338
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,800
My watch.

339
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,860
Take it off.

340
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,760
Wait.

341
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,020
No, I'm going in.

342
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:19,070
Hold it.

343
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,220
Don't ruin the plan.

344
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,790
It's fake.

345
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,490
No wonder it looked so weird.

346
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,080
Turn around.

347
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,360
It's okay.

348
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,460
Come with us.

349
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,740
Attention, all units.

350
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,670
The targets are leaving
through the front door.

351
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:52,640
Come on!

352
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,550
Stay close, everyone.

353
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,360
They're gone.

354
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,900
It must be the alley behind us.

355
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,320
They tricked us.

356
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,040
Call Traffic Control.

357
00:22:36,130 --> 00:22:37,620
We need the security footage.

358
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:38,810
Yes.

359
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,550
Mr. Zhao.

360
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:02,750
It has been a while

361
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,110
since we last saw each other.

362
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:09,080
Is this how you treat your clients?

363
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,110
Do you treat them like thieves?

364
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,600
I've never seen this before.

365
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,320
Where's your boss?

366
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,650
What's the hurry?

367
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,830
Please come in.

368
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,350
I finally get a day off

369
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,760
and a nice meal.

370
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,340
Hello?

371
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,760
I'm having a hot pot with Kexin.

372
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,390
Why? Are you jealous?

373
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,690
Text me Linda's location.

374
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:55,460
You lost Linda?

375
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,670
Hold on.

376
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,790
Eat up. I need to take this call.

377
00:24:10,070 --> 00:24:11,300
What's going on?

378
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,230
How did you lose Linda?

379
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:15,830
Shut up. Just send me the location.

380
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,590
Give me a second.

381
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,770
I sent it to you. Did you get it?

382
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,270
Okay, thank you.

383
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,590
Hold on.

384
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:37,830
I think this address

385
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,640
is Tieguanyin's fish farm.

386
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,060
[So isn't she working for Tieguanyin?]

387
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:46,940
About that,

388
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,140
I won't know until I see it.

389
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:51,860
Wait for me at home.

390
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,890
[Okay, be careful.]

391
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:01,280
[Innovation in technology,
Precision in command, Service in action]

392
00:24:58,420 --> 00:24:59,300
Director Liu.

393
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:00,970
What's happening?

394
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,690
There was a situation.

395
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,050
We lost Rong Yao's location.

396
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:05,110
We can't find him now.

397
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,250
Director Liu.

398
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,660
It's Captain Rong and Zhao Ran.

399
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,900
We need immediate reinforcements

400
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,140
to find their location.

401
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,910
-Xiaowang.
-Yes, sir.

402
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,890
Initiate emergency protocol.

403
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,030
Search the city.

404
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,130
Yes.

405
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,290
You two, wait in the car.

406
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,140
I'll let you know
as soon as we have any news.

407
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,190
Yes.

408
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,660
Hello, Director Liu.

409
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:35,250
I was about to call you.

410
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,540
When Li Ruosheng
was stalking Liu Qingqing,

411
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,470
he put a tracker

412
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,790
on the back of her phone case.

413
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,520
[I'm heading to her location now.]

414
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,070
But right now, Liu Qingqing

415
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,610
is at one of Tieguanyin's fish farms.

416
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:48,980
Tieguanyin?

417
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,000
Are you sure?

418
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,940
I'm not completely sure yet.

419
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,390
Okay.

420
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,150
I'll ask the task force to work with you.

421
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,260
But they can only watch.

422
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,030
They won't show up
unless there's an emergency,

423
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,260
[Do you understand?]

424
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:03,580
Yes.

425
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,830
You must be careful.

426
00:26:06,710 --> 00:26:07,590
[Yes, sir.]

427
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:17,270
[Attention, all units.]

428
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,760
[We have Captain Rong's position.]

429
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,870
[Please proceed
to the location immediately.]

430
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,680
[Yes, ma'am!]

431
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,780
How long do we have to wait?

432
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,990
I want to meet your boss, not you.

433
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,810
My boss is on the way.

434
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,870
She'll be here soon.

435
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,980
If you're worried,

436
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,220
have some tea first.

437
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:02,410
You...

438
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,860
Boss, calm down.

439
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,180
-Linda.
-Don't be mad.

440
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,190
Have a seat.

441
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,170
Have a seat.

442
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,270
Boss, here. Have some tea.

443
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,690
What's wrong with Linda and Mu Qing?

444
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,660
Where did they go?

445
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,830
I'm asking you.

446
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,730
Stop freaking out, will you?

447
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,620
I'm thinking.

448
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,920
While we're having hot pot here,

449
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,640
Mu Qing is out with Linda?

450
00:27:58,330 --> 00:27:59,300
Where are they going?

451
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,710
This won't do.

452
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,160
Take your time. I'm going out.

453
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,100
Where are you going?

454
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,550
Tell me right now.

455
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,600
Where are they?

456
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,450
I have some business to tend to.

457
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,510
It's not about those two.

458
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,830
It's about me. Okay?

459
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,240
I don't care.

460
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,470
Tell me clearly.

461
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:15,010
What is Mu Qing doing with Linda?

462
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,940
What are you saying? There's no time.

463
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,310
I don't care if there's no time.

464
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,290
You're not going anywhere
unless you tell me.

465
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,380
Mu Qing is in trouble.

466
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,240
Mu Qing and Linda are in trouble?

467
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,090
It's not about him and Linda.

468
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,770
He was tracing Linda to her boss.

469
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,230
But it's probably a setup by the police.

470
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,180
The police?

471
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:39,780
Are you serious?

472
00:28:39,870 --> 00:28:41,100
I'm not sure.

473
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,370
I'm just not sure.

474
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,910
But if I don't go now,

475
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,100
it will be too late.

476
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,090
Why didn't you say that earlier?

477
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,100
Where are you going?

478
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,210
This is one-tenth of the package.

479
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,440
Take it for now.

480
00:29:03,850 --> 00:29:05,870
Do you take me for a fool?

481
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,890
I brought you the rest of the money,

482
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,650
yet you only gave me
a tenth of the package.

483
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:13,130
I'm sorry. That's all for today.

484
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,730
Leave the money here.

485
00:29:15,810 --> 00:29:17,930
Let's talk about the rest in a few days.

486
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,130
That's against the rules.

487
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,360
I am the rule.

488
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,120
You can't do that.

489
00:29:23,910 --> 00:29:24,880
Where's your boss?

490
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,590
I want to talk to your boss.

491
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:28,530
I'm the dealer today.

492
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,070
If you want to make a deal,

493
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,570
then take these.

494
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,590
If you don't want to make a deal,

495
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,790
I'll make you leave now.

496
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,810
Kexin, you can't go.

497
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,570
You can't get emotional now.

498
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,980
I'm not being emotional.

499
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,430
Calm down and think about it.

500
00:29:42,610 --> 00:29:44,330
Let's say those people are the police.

501
00:29:44,410 --> 00:29:45,730
Do you know about their setup?

502
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,460
Do you know about their deal?

503
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,310
Maybe Mu Qing could have
escaped unscathed.

504
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,410
You might make it worse.

505
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,700
That's exactly why you can't go.

506
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,930
Why can you?

507
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:55,900
You're on the list.

508
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,660
They'll have you arrested too.

509
00:29:58,450 --> 00:29:59,370
What are you thinking?

510
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,400
I can't let anything happen to my friend.

511
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,420
I can't let anything happen
to my boyfriend either!

512
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,740
I'm not like you guys.

513
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:05,800
I'm not a drug dealer.

514
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,980
Even if they are the police,

515
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,260
they can't do anything to me.

516
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:10,280
I can surprise them all.

517
00:30:10,370 --> 00:30:11,960
That's the only way to save Mu Qing.

518
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,080
Stop thinking and let's go!

519
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,460
I've been in this business for years.

520
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,480
No one has ever dared to do this to me.

521
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,800
When doing business,

522
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,560
you shouldn't be so overbearing.

523
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,970
I won't do it.

524
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,700
Return the money. The deal is off.

525
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,460
What's the rush?

526
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,740
Boss.

527
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,820
It's a troop of lady soldiers.

528
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,240
You wanted to see the boss.

529
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,610
Here I am.

530
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,780
[In 300m, turn left.]

531
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,280
[Please slow down.]

532
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:17,780
[Innovation in technology,
Precision in command, Service in action]

533
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,740
Cut the car in front. Hurry.

534
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,220
Now that the true boss is here,

535
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,200
let's begin our deal.

536
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,280
Weren't you just about to leave?

537
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,870
I was just hot-tempered.

538
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,240
I can't stop you

539
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:39,650
if you really want to leave.

540
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,320
But my girls have been working so hard.

541
00:31:41,410 --> 00:31:42,640
They have to be paid.

542
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:44,220
Otherwise, you can't leave.

543
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,380
A double-cross?

544
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,050
That's not nice.

545
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:50,870
I'm afraid that's not the case.

546
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:05,470
Mr. Mu.

547
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,280
What are you doing here?

548
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,210
I want to see Tieguanyin.

549
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,840
She's in a meeting. She can't meet you.

550
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:15,420
Tie him up and interrogate him.

551
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,060
-Boss.
-This...

552
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,470
Shut up.

553
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,340
Don't move!

554
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,480
You're pretty good.

555
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,550
Are you trained?

556
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,970
Tieguanyin.

557
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,300
Since you're disloyal,

558
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,590
don't blame us for being rude.

559
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,140
He even knows my name.

560
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,640
Do you think by doing this,

561
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:58,180
you'll make it out alive?

562
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,470
Think harder.

563
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:09,360
[Kexin]

564
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,380
[Where are you?]

565
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,450
What's wrong?

566
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,950
Li Ruosheng said

567
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,930
there might be a cop

568
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,420
among the people at the meeting.

569
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:20,620
[It's the same cop who chased me]

570
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,120
when Dakun set us up.

571
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,620
He's Mr. Zhao's man.

572
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,630
Be careful.

573
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,440
We're on our way.

574
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:29,730
[Don't worry, I'm here.]

575
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:39,410
I'll count to three.

576
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:41,740
If you don't let him go,

577
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:44,120
I'll shoot you in the head.

578
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:46,800
Three.

579
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,620
Two.

580
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,060
Guanyin.

581
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:04,180
Guanyin, why are you here?

582
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,770
Mu Qing.

583
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,929
I'm also wondering. Why are you here?

584
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:17,429
Should we get closer?
I can't see anything.

585
00:34:17,730 --> 00:34:18,659
No.

586
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,780
If we're exposed, they'll be in danger.

587
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,670
Guanyin.

588
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,080
We're all family.

589
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,310
That's not necessary.

590
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,820
Don't worry, Guanyin.

591
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,670
I came alone.

592
00:34:37,929 --> 00:34:39,690
I didn't even tell Mr. Ou about this.

593
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,150
Where's Li Ruosheng?

594
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,280
He's doing something else.

595
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,090
Let's be honest.

596
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:50,690
Tell me how you got here.

597
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:58,520
Li Ruosheng put a tracker

598
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,800
on Linda's phone case.

599
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,600
I followed the tracker to get here.

600
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,020
You can take a look.

601
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,970
Ms. Guanyin.

602
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,240
Why are you everywhere?

603
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,980
It's not safe to know too much.

604
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,560
You might lose your head for it.

605
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:33,320
Guanyin.

606
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,920
What's in it for you?

607
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,470
You know Mr. Ou's temper very well.

608
00:35:38,910 --> 00:35:40,500
You know what he hates.

609
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,870
You're making deals behind his back

610
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,590
and even imitating Scorpion's technique.

611
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,570
If Mr. Ou finds out about this,

612
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,680
what do you think will happen?

613
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:54,620
Guanyin, don't be rash.

614
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:56,070
I'm not the kind of person

615
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,130
who tells on others.

616
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:00,300
I didn't mean to blackmail you.

617
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,630
Making extra money isn't a big deal.

618
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,120
It doesn't harm me,

619
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,660
and I can't stop you either.

620
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,380
Don't you agree, Guanyin?

621
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:20,180
Mr. Ou.

622
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,210
I was getting nervous

623
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,700
when you mentioned him.

624
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,970
What do you plan to do then?

625
00:36:31,310 --> 00:36:33,560
These two work for me.

626
00:36:34,170 --> 00:36:35,850
I wanted them to find out

627
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:37,740
whom Linda is working for.

628
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:39,630
I didn't expect it to be you.

629
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,570
What a coincidence, right?

630
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,470
You two, apologize to Guanyin.

631
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,780
Ms. Guanyin, I'm Yao Yuan.

632
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,930
This is Tiannan.

633
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:50,890
Tiannan...

634
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:51,950
Throw the knife away.

635
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,690
Greet Ms. Guanyin.

636
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,770
I'm sorry, Ms. Guanyin.

637
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,270
My name is Zhao Tiannan.

638
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,610
Look, it's just a misunderstanding.

639
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,240
You two should get going.

640
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,040
Come on.

641
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,850
Hold on.

642
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:14,480
Turn around. Let me see your face.

643
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:22,090
Yao Yuan.

644
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,260
Zhao Tiannan, isn't it?

645
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:31,020
Why have I never seen you two before?

646
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:35,510
It's Li Ruosheng's car.

647
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,300
I'm warning you.

648
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:41,320
Stay in the car.

649
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,280
Kexin.

650
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,110
Take this.

651
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,700
Why would I take it? I'm not crazy.

652
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,320
You're silly.

653
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,880
Listen, if I'm not back in 15 minutes,

654
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:52,930
call my dad.

655
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,480
Be careful.

656
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:03,580
That's strange.

657
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:04,770
Why is Ou Kexin here too?

658
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:06,970
Ou Kexin is here.

659
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,160
Attention, all units.

660
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,050
If things get out of hand,

661
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:11,460
move in.

662
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:12,780
Make it quick.

663
00:38:12,950 --> 00:38:13,920
Yes, sir.

664
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:14,930
Mu Qing.

665
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,910
You said that they're your men.

666
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,420
Can you prove it?

667
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,350
If you can't prove it,

668
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,870
no one gets out of here alive!

669
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,980
Guanyin, you're here too.

670
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,480
Ms. Ou, why are you here?

671
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,810
Li Ruosheng told me

672
00:38:45,070 --> 00:38:46,660
that Mu Qing was with Linda.

673
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,020
I thought they were on a date.

674
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,660
So I forced him to give me her location.

675
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,650
It's quite crowded here.

676
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,240
It doesn't seem like a date.

677
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:59,770
Kexin, how could I have a date here?

678
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,100
-How would I know?
-Ms. Ou.

679
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,990
We're having a serious conversation.

680
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,490
You should go home.

681
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:08,350
It's cold by the sea. Don't catch a cold.

682
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,010
What is this?

683
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:19,170
Are you making a deal

684
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:21,900
behind my dad's back?

685
00:39:23,790 --> 00:39:24,850
Guanyin.

686
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:27,490
Does my dad know about the deal?

687
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,690
Ms. Ou.

688
00:39:30,790 --> 00:39:33,070
When did you get involved

689
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,480
in running the group?

690
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,900
Your dad doesn't know about that, does he?

691
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,850
I know how the group works.

692
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,650
I won't get involved

693
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,190
in anything that's business-related.

694
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,040
It's just that

695
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,150
this group belongs to my dad after all.

696
00:39:47,330 --> 00:39:48,560
And I'm his daughter.

697
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,060
Tell me.

698
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,170
After seeing this,

699
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,550
should I tell my dad?

700
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,420
Actually, it's not what you think.

701
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:05,770
Ms. Ou, what are you trying to say?

702
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,100
What am I trying to say?

703
00:40:08,270 --> 00:40:09,680
I'm not trying to say anything.

704
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:13,110
I just thought they were on a date.

705
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:16,410
I didn't expect to run into a secret deal.

706
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,960
From what I see, Guanyin,

707
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,940
shouldn't you give me an explanation?

708
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,900
Actually, it can't be explained

709
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,220
in just a few words.

710
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,380
It's not what you think.

711
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,830
Guanyin.

712
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,330
I was kidding.

713
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:33,310
Everyone has their own motives.

714
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,670
I get it.

715
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,770
You need to have a motive

716
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:38,020
so you can truly work for the group.

717
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,150
I'll let you fulfill your motive.

718
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,380
Guanyin.

719
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,880
What about my motive?

720
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,860
Shouldn't you let me fulfill it as well?

721
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,540
Kexin.

722
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,960
Tell me what you want.

723
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:54,470
It's him.

724
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,420
I have my eyes on him.

725
00:40:57,770 --> 00:41:00,020
I just don't want to see

726
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,690
any fly or insects

727
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,500
that keep buzzing around.

728
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:06,400
It's so annoying.

729
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,730
Guanyin.

730
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,710
Can you keep your people out of it?

731
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,080
Kexin.

732
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:14,930
Don't say that.

733
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:17,350
Why? Are you worried about her?

734
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,420
No, I'm not.

735
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,090
This is business.

736
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,980
You're not supposed to be involved.

737
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,620
Take my men with you.

738
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,720
Get out of here.

739
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:32,000
Fine, I'll get going.

740
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:34,070
But this isn't over yet.

741
