I have one more question.

59

You're Mr. Dakun's man.

Why didn't he just kill me?

70

Because they're putting on a show.

71
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,800
Their act was to have me promoted.

72

that there was a cop on Mr. Dakun's turf?

94

I'm just here to clean it up.

95

You're Xiaowei?

99
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,340
How did Dakun make you contact me?

100
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,659
Mr. Dakun told me that

101
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:50,170
if anything happens,

102
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,970
he would set off a bomb.

103
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,520
He said you'd take care of the aftermath.

104
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:57,740
After Dakun captured the cop,

105
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,940
were you in charge of watching him?

Tell me. Why are you looking at him?

The reason why you two are still here

126

was pure luck.

00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,680
Now that he's out of danger,

175
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,350
all of you don't have to stay here.

176
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,580
Take shifts.

177
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,250
All right.

178
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,600
I have something to tell you.

179
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,750
Is Zhao Nan all right?

180
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,030
He's okay.

181
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,010
That's great.

182
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,160
Glasses bought off the driver.

183
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,530
It was probably Ou Zhenhai's idea.

184
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:55,420
They must be afraid of loose ends.

185
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:58,010
So they killed him.

186
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,800
Keep the debt for now.

187
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,350
Spectre hasn't appeared.

188

It's not our time to stop yet.

your target is still Group K.

191

Director Wang has said it before.

192
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,760
He's initiating Skylark.

193
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,700
You all have more responsibilities now.

194
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,060
You have to keep two agents safe

195
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,250

Mrs. Zhao came.

Right. You must be tired.

I just think

233
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,310
that you're always working.

234
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,850
You always work overtime too.

235

You're too tense.

this lunch for you.

248

it was Dakun's place.

255

But it belongs to Mu Qing now.

256
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,310
Such huge trouble happened there.

257

Wasn't it a great chance

258

kindness is my biggest strength.

263
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,420
How about this?

264
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,960
Here.

265
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:08,730
You do it.

266
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:16,170
Fine, I'll do it.

267
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,240

isn't that too reckless?

273

Will this be any good for me?

284

285
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,170
and the huge incident at his territory,

286

That's my opinion.

288
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,720
You both tell me what to do.

289
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,240
Okay.

290
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,780
Fine.

291
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:08,670

292
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,650
that Ou Kexin's birthday is in two days?

293
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,410
I, Congtou,

294
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,690
will light the first match.

295
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,630
Both of you can do the rest.

296
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,680
That's my plan.

297
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:18,710
That's great.

298

Guanyin.

302
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,010
Congtou was right.

We are in the same boat.

304
00:19:48,410 --> 00:19:49,550
I know.

305
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,990
Find out where Mu Qing is.

306
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,780
I want to see him.

307
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:20,790
Yes.

Yes.

310
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,420
Then lift your chin and stare haughtily.

311
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,330
Put your hand there.

312
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,300
Right here.

313
00:20:38,430 --> 00:20:40,280
Yes, that's better.

314
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,130
That's right. Chin up.

315
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,020
Sir, your expression.

316
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:44,990
Show more expression.

317
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,950
That's good. Change into the next outfit.

324

That's very thoughtful of you.

It's because you like it.

00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:51,130
that we both like.

347
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,550
But I remember

348
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:55,580
someone said he didn't like it.

349
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,940
I like it now.

350
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,390
But I don't like it anymore.

351
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:03,100
Tell me.

352
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,270
Should I accept the gift or not?

353
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,280
I'll take it because it's you.

354
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:18,940
Kexin.

355
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,520
Kexin.

356
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:22,900
Kexin.

357
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,290
Thank you.

358
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,170
Guanyin.

359
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,760
Why are you here?

360
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,300
I miss you.

361
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,940
Can't I come and visit you?

362
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,000
Mu Qing is here too?

363
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,900
I have a photo shoot today,

364
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,220
so I asked him to help.

365
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,590
Mu Qing is very busy right now.

366
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,090
Asking him for help,

367
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,850
won't it delay him?

368
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,780
Being able to help me

369
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:51,060
is an honor for him.

370
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:52,510
Isn't it, Mu Qing?

371
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:55,020
Yes, Ms. Ou. Thank you for the honor.

372
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,120
You're welcome.

373
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,060
They're picking photos.

374
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,200
Take a look at it for me.

375
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,380
Go on.

376
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:06,550
This one works.

377
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,530
-I don't like it.
-It's out of focus.

378
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,640
-What about this?
-Guanyin, let's talk over there.

379
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,960
Let me see.

380
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,860
You have good taste.

381
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,680
Guanyin.

382
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,020
Don't be shy.

383
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,430
You're single.

384
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,880
It's very normal.

385
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:35,280
What do you think of him?

386
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,730
I think he's great.

387
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:39,680
He's handsome and smart.

388
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,670
He's also calm and collected.

389
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,690
If you ask me,

390
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,250
there isn't any problem.

391
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:50,110
But...

392
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,000
career-minded people

393
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,980
usually can't take care of others.

394
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,610
So in that sense,

395
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,810
I'm sure you'll be troubled.

396
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,970
But I just don't get it.

397
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,310
You're such a good girl.

398
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,730
Why do you have to spend time with him?

399
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,490
What is it that you want?

400
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,710
One more thing.

401
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:18,660
Do you know his family and background?

402
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,550
Most importantly,

403
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:22,930
will your dad agree?

404
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,110
My dad only cares about money.

405
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,560
He doesn't know this.

406
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,200
That's why

407
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,800
you should be careful about this.

408
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,610
You need experience and skills.

409
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,250
What do you mean?

410
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:40,970
Why don't you meet more people?

411
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,790
I think

412
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:46,510
Li Ruosheng is a nice guy.

413
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,890
At least he's not dull.

414
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,300
He's also very caring.

415
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:52,980
He's not serious.

416
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,310
He should look after himself.

417
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,730
Look at you getting nervous.

418
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,880
I was just kidding.

419
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,240
All right.

420
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,270
I'm hungry.

421
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,940
Let's go get something to eat.

422
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,220
Ask Mu Qing to come too.

423
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,260
-You're eating so many oysters.
-This is a lot.

424
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,530
I heard you need models

425
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,940
for Fashion Week next month.

426
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,390
I can give you some models.

427
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,120
You're a fashionista indeed.

428
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,920
I'm so relieved that you're here.

429
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:33,500
When will they come?

430
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,010
Send someone to get them tomorrow.

431
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,390
Let them rehearse and try on the clothes.

432
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,490
All right.

433
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,340
Go tomorrow afternoon.

434
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,400
Bring me those models.

435
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,700
I'll order more food.

436
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:47,720
Sure.

437
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,180
Waitress.

438
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:55,020
What is this?

439
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,210
It looks delicious.

440
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,110
Kexin is so pretty and cute.

441
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,500
Guanyin.

442
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,360
You didn't ask us out

443
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,740
because of her.

444
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,280
You were looking for me, right?

445
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,560
Glasses and Congtou are after you.

446
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,030
I know that.

447
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,890
What about you, Guanyin?

448
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,570
This is what Glasses and Congtou want.

449
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,180
The head is the power.

450
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,960
I don't want those stupid things.

451
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,910
All I need is the tail.

452
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,110
Guanyin, are you talking

453
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,140
about cooperation?

454
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,000
That's up to you.

455
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,320
Guanyin.

456
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,690
-Can you choose some for me?
-Okay.

457
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,190
I'll go and take a look.

458
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,010
You mean

459
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:01,940
Tieguanyin wants you on her side?

460
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,580
It's not just me.

461
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,030
She wants both of us.

462
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:08,450
What do you think then?

463
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:09,510
Should we agree?

464
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,630
We'll be working for her if we agree.

465
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,730
It's not good for us.

466
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:14,970
Besides,

467
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,900
Mr. Glasses and Mr. Congtou

468
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,220
are still onto us.

469
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,510
If we get into more trouble now,

470
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:22,400
that would be unwise.

471
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,980
There's something I don't understand.

472
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:29,490
Our shipment goes online now.

473
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,380
Are Dakun's properties even useful?

474
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,050
You insisted on going

475
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:34,590
for his ruined storage.

476
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,480
They're worthless
and the police were there.

477
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,330
What were you thinking?

478
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,010
I made a mistake.

479
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,860
You make mistakes?

480
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,370
We've taken all the turfs on the list.

481
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,130
They're all Mr. Dakun's territories.

482
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,050
I have an idea of what to do with them.

483
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:56,940
What idea?

484
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,280
I'm not sure

485
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,440
if the police have seen this list.

486
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:05,120
Because of what happened to Mr. Dakun,

487
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:07,280
all these places are no longer secure.

488
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:09,480
Since these aren't safe,

489
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,500
why don't we do the others a favor?

490
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,090
We give them these places.

491
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,200
A favor?

492
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,580
It's easy for you to say.

493
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,620
We risked our lives to earn these turfs.

494
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,120
I have my reasons.

495
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,570
Don't lecture me.

496
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,070
I disagree.

497
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,030
How did Dakun steal our territory?

498
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:32,760
Now that we finally got it back,

499
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,660
you're giving it up that easily?

500
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:40,370
You know how it is.

501
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:43,360
We hold a different position
in the group now.

502
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,380
If we push it too hard,

503
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,140
we'll make enemies.

504
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,340
Dakun is gone. What enemy?

505
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,430
Mr. Ou thinks highly of us now.

506
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:58,710
He let us become a new power
within the group.

507
00:29:58,930 --> 00:29:59,950
But in the meantime,

508
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:01,660
we also became an opponent

509
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,210
of Glasses, Congtou, and Guanyin.

510
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:06,550
How are we an opponent?

511
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:09,890
We're just replacing Dakun's position.

512
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,440
We're their partners.

513
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:15,570
When Mr. Dakun went down,

514
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:18,340
they didn't gain anything from it.

515
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,410
They won't give up.

516
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,400
If they work together against us,

517
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,470
I can't imagine the consequences.

518
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:28,280
So you think

519
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,950
that we should take a step back.

520
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,950
They'll never see it coming.

521
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,190
After we've got such a huge profit,

522
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,950
we'd even try to give them some.

523
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,150
It's what Mr. Ou wants too.

524
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,570
We take care of the group's well-being.

525
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,710
We don't pick fights.

526
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,080
We bow to the others.

527
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,410
Besides,

528
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:49,580
Mr. Dakun's turf only seems profitable.

529
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,380
The police have their eyes on it.

530
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,850
It's actually dangerous to keep it.

531
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,610
We might as well give it away.

532
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:02,690
Then how exactly

533
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,320
are you going to do this?

534
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,190
We don't show off.

535
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,510
We'll do it unintentionally.

536
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:27,500
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

537
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,990
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

538
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:36,880
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

539
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:42,510
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

540
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,320
Happy birthday!

541
00:31:45,410 --> 00:31:46,820
Happy birthday!

542
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,200
Thank you, Dad.

543
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,480
Today is Kexin's birthday.

544
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,460
Let's enjoy this meal together.

545
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,660
I haven't cooked for a long time,

546
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:12,080
so I'm not sure how the food will taste.

547
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,630
But whether it's delicious or not,

548
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,740
you have to eat it
even if you don't want to.

549
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,260
Mr. Ou, don't say that.

550
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,720
Who doesn't know that you're a great cook?

551
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,000
You're being overly humble.

552
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:25,450
That's the same as arrogance.

553
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:26,990
Today,

554
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,930
being able to eat these dishes,

555
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:32,010
I must be blessed by my ancestors.

556
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:35,090
-Listen to him.
-Mr. Congtou.

557
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:36,710
Come on. Let's eat.

558
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,990
Okay.

559
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,250
-It smells so good. I'm starving.
-Thank you, sir.

560
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,680
It smells so good.

561
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:53,480
Look at the color of this fish.

562
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:54,840
I'll try the squid.

563
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,650
It's so good.

564
00:33:01,130 --> 00:33:03,420
Sir, it's really hard to stir-fry squid.

565
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,830
If there isn't enough heat,

566
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,930
it will be flavorless.

567
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,250
If it's fried for too long,

568
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,750
it will be too hard to chew.

569
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:11,170
Raw squid is also very annoying.

570
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:14,600
If its eight tentacles stick to something,

571
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:16,010
you can't pull them off.

572
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,110
They won't even move.

573
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:19,440
Just like some people in the group.

574
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:22,120
They're just as annoying.

575
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,850
Mu Qing.

576
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,210
Don't you think I'm right?

577
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,790
Mr. Congtou.

578
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,370
Why are you asking him about cooking?

579
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,560
He wouldn't know.

580
00:33:34,710 --> 00:33:35,890
But speaking of it,

581
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:37,300
while stir-frying squid,

582
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,410
you need to add green onions

583
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,690
to get rid of the smell.

584
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,320
Did you forget?

585
00:33:42,710 --> 00:33:43,900
Mr. Congtou.

586
00:33:44,210 --> 00:33:45,620
Why don't you give us some

587
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,420
so my dad can stir-fry it again?

588
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,410
Ms. Ou, don't scare me.

589
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:52,390
That would be more than just the onion.

590
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,420
You'd be stir-frying squid with my head.

591
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:55,650
I wouldn't dare.

592
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,850
Here. I was rude, I misspoke.

593
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,180
-I'll make a toast as an apology.
-Sure.

594
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:01,900
-Come on, everyone.
-Okay, come on.

595
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,700
Happy birthday.

596
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:04,710
Mu Qing.

597
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:07,310
-Godfather.
-Right.

598
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,810
Mu Qing.

599
00:34:13,290 --> 00:34:14,790
I want black fungus. Get some for me.

600
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,960
Come on. Hurry up.

601
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,520
Thank you.

602
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,040
It's perfect.

603
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,179
Thank you, Mr. Congtou.

604
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,770
No way.

605
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:34,409
This is the latest fall collection.

606
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:36,880
Guanyin, you're amazing.

607
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,460
How are you so great?

608
00:34:38,550 --> 00:34:39,909
Come on, let me see.

609
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,139
Look.

610
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,420
-Look at this.
-Is it pretty?

611
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,710
Is it pretty?

612
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,830
Our Kexin is really beautiful.

613
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:50,380
You're a fashion designer.

614
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,719
The model is the soul.

615
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:55,360
I asked a friend from France

616
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,679
to bring this gift for you.

617
00:34:57,070 --> 00:34:57,950
Do you like it?

618
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,460
I don't just like it. I love it.

619
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,560
Thank you.

620
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,620
There are so many gifts.

621
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,580
Take a look.

622
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,640
Wait.

623
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,000
This one.

624
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,010
This is a nice piece of jade.

625
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,990
It's spotless.

626
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,500
Beautiful women are matched
with pretty jade.

627
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,730
Happy birthday.

628
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:18,060
-Thank you, Mr. Glasses.
-I wish you peace.

629
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,110
Happy birthday.

630
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,770
I messed up.

631
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:25,050
I'm so clueless.

632
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,950
I got you a similar gift.

633
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,620
It's something you put on your neck too.

634
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,250
I'm really sorry, Mr. Glasses.

635
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:34,160
Kexin, I'm too uncultured.

636
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,390
I'm not good with words.

637
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:36,760
May you get even prettier

638
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,080
and make all men go crazy.

639
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,710
This is pretty.

640
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,210
This is pretty too. I like both.

641
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,490
But Mr. Glasses,

642
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:45,470
this jade is too good.

643
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,270
I should keep it at home.

644
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,690
Or it will cause trouble.

645
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,410
Am I right, Dad?

646
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:53,520
Why would you ask me?

647
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,670
Do whatever you like.

648
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,000
Thank you, Mr. Glasses.

649
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,190
You're welcome.

650
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,080
Here, put it on for me.

651
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:02,810
Not you.

652
00:36:03,550 --> 00:36:04,570
You do it, Mu Qing.

653
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:08,130
Come on, put it on me.

654
00:36:10,590 --> 00:36:11,520
Come on.

655
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:19,920
No.

656
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:21,370
Where's your gift for me?

657
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,720
Kexin.

658
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:25,770
The two of us

659
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,050
bought the necklace together.

660
00:36:27,230 --> 00:36:28,460
Together?

661
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,910
No way.

662
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,760
You're two grown men.

663
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,210
You only got me one present?

664
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,690
Dad.

665
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:39,020
They're so cheap.

666
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,380
Two of them only gave me one.

667
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,960
-You didn't prepare a gift?
-This isn't right.

668
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:43,420
-Kexin.
-This won't do.

669
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:45,750
Tell me.

670
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,950
Who got me this necklace?

671
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,400
Is it from you?

672
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:51,160
Or is it from you?

673
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:54,110
The necklace is a gift from Li Ruosheng.

674
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,140
Ms. Ou.

675
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,260
I know you don't lack anything.

676
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,710
Ordinary things don't suit you.

677
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,160
How about this?

678
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,350
Whatever you need,

679
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,500
I will do my best

680
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:07,130
to do three things for you.

681
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:10,040
Does...

682
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,880
Does that count as a birthday gift?

683
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,910
Yes.

684
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,400
It's so thoughtful.

685
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,080
I like it.

686
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,800
Is what you said true?

687
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,070
You'll do anything?

688
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,240
As long as I can do it,

689
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,130
I'll do anything.

690
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:30,670
That's good.

691
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:31,860
I need a boyfriend.

692
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,240
Until I find myself a boyfriend,

693
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,130
you'll be more than an assistant.

694
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,400
You have to

695
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,990
go on dates with me.

696
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,290
Godfather, I have to say something.

697
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,270
I don't agree.

698
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,780
Mu Qing is my business partner,

699
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,230
my roommate, and my strategist.

700
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,120
If you take him from me,

701
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:51,310
what should I do?

702
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,730
Kexin, if you need an assistant,

703
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,090
I'll do it.

704
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,720
I'm gentle, considerate,

705
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:57,910
capable, and a good cook.

706
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,960
Most importantly,

707
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,900
my biceps

708
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,830
are perfect for carrying a lady's purse.

709
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,900
That's too bad.

710
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:07,540
I don't like the stupid type.

711
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,080
You like to flirt with women.

712
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:10,140
I don't like that either.

713
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,940
I'm not stupid.

714
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:12,910
Go away.

715
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:15,290
Dad, am I asking for too much?

716
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,870
Say something.

717
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,840
Cut it out, Kexin.

718
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:18,980
You're a girl. You...

719
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,870
Even if I agree, it won't matter.

720
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,680
Mu Qing has to agree to it.

721
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:24,220
What must he agree?

722
00:38:24,310 --> 00:38:25,630
You're in charge of this.

723
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,560
If you say yes, he can't say no.

724
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,310
Dad, it's my birthday.

725
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,430
You can't do this. Say yes.

726
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:36,270
-Say yes.
-Fine.

727
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,640
What else can I do?

728
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:39,620
-Seriously...
-I know you're the best.

729
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:41,690
My dad is the best.

730
00:38:41,910 --> 00:38:43,310
It's over.

731
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:46,000
She's stealing from us.

732
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,270
There's more.

733
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:48,290
I'm telling you.

734
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:49,610
I'm not stopping here.

735
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,250
If he makes me happy during this period

736
00:38:52,550 --> 00:38:54,010
and we get along,

737
00:38:54,310 --> 00:38:55,900
I'll promote him

738
00:38:55,990 --> 00:38:57,000
to be my real boyfriend.

739
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,130
What do you think, Dad?

740
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:04,960
What do you think?

741
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:05,970
After what I said,

742
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:07,470
you must be really happy, right?

743
00:39:09,010 --> 00:39:11,030
Smile if you're happy.

744
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,350
You're always so serious.

745
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,410
Smile.

746
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:16,530
Smile.

747
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:19,830
That's right.

748
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,400
Dad.

749
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:25,290
Where's your present for me?

750
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,240
Kexin wouldn't leave you alone.

751
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:38,360
I hope she didn't make you uncomfortable.

752
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,220
No, sir.

753
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,370
She may be a bit spoiled,

754
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:46,230
but sometimes, she's quite cute.

755
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:48,610
Do you really think so?

756
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,850
She is a bit childish,

757
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,390
but I won't take it seriously.

758
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,000
Hearing you say that,

759
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,360
I'm quite relieved.

760
00:39:58,420 --> 00:40:00,140
She didn't grow up by my side,

761
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,190
so she's not disciplined.

762
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,690
As time goes by,

763
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,180
she ended up like this.

764
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,470
She doesn't have friends in Yungang.

765
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,940
Just play along with her.

766
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:10,340
Don't be serious.

767
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:11,840
She's a young woman.

768
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,120
She acts before she thinks.

769
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,980
I'm sure she didn't think it through.

770
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,120
Don't take it seriously.

771
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,670
Sir.

772
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,260
If there's anything I can do,

773
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,360
just tell me.

774
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,510
Kexin is your precious daughter.

775
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,620
I know what I'm doing.

776
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,080
I'm very self-aware.

777
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:34,980
Mu Qing.

778
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,580
Do you know what I like
about you the most?

779
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,520
You're calm.

780
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,920
You're young,

781
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,990
but you always think twice
before you move.

782
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,490
It's not easy.

783
00:40:45,670 --> 00:40:46,600
Thank you, sir.

784
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:50,560
You and Ruosheng have taken over

785
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,050
Dakun's business.

786
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:53,860
As you know,

787
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,230
the sales network

788
00:40:56,890 --> 00:40:58,870
has always been our lifeline.

789
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,600
Now, the network has been shattered.

790
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,540
There's not enough blood.

791
00:41:04,370 --> 00:41:05,780
The most important task at hand

792
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:08,330
is to rebuild our network.

793
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,070
I believe you have the ability and spirit.

794
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,050
Don't disappoint me.

795
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,070
I understand, sir.

796
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:20,830
Can you get it done

797
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,280
within two weeks?

798
00:41:23,290 --> 00:41:24,170
Sir.

799
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,930
It will be done in a week.

800
00:41:28,310 --> 00:41:29,190
That's good.

801
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,910
Come here. Let's have some tea.

802
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:42,260
