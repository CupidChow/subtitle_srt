3
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,620
Sir.

4
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:39,870
Are you suspecting

5
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,640
that I was trying to run away?

6
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,360
Am I wrong?

7
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,670
You know what they say.

8
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,590
God is above everyone.

9
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,740
The heavens know everything we're doing.

10
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,200
I, Congtou,

11
00:01:56,770 --> 00:01:58,880
swear to the heavens today.

12
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,950
If I'm planning to run away,

13
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,050
I'll die a horrible death

14
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,460
and be struck by lightning.

15
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,060
What about that woman just now?

16
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,570
I found a girl

17
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,180
to have fun and pleasure.

18
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,940
We only did it on a boat.

19
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,350
Isn't that normal?

20
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,480
Congtou.

21
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,000
Glasses kidnapped your woman.

22
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,200
I'll get to the bottom of this.

23
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,390
But let me warn you.

24
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,070
Dakun revolted.

25
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,270
Tieguanyin died.

26
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,310
At a time like this,

27
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,160
if you back out,

28
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:46,310
then don't blame me

29
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,070
for disregarding our years of friendship.

30
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,280
Sir.

31
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:52,910
No matter who quits,

32
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:55,950
I'll never quit.

33
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,370
As long as you tell Glasses

34
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:59,690
to give me back my wife,

35
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,660
I will do anything.

36
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:04,840
Okay, I get it.

37
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:06,550
You may go.

38
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,320
No, sir.

39
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,870
But you must tell me, I...

40
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,210
Don't you trust me?

41
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:28,370
Mr. Glasses.

42
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,150
Thank you

43
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,650
for taking care

44
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:37,700
of my wife and child.

45
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,520
Why didn't you check clearly
before you act?

46
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,690
Why didn't you check clearly?

47
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,529
Find Xiaoyue right now.

48
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,769
Keep an eye on her.

49
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:22,010
Tell those who are watching Congtou
to back off!

50
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,320
You would even believe Congtou's words.

51
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,730
Wasn't it because of you?

52
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,530
You've become so passive!

53
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,030
Okay.

54
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:33,930
I'm on it.

55
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,700
Come on!

56
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,340
It's all your fault.

57
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,340
Where are Li Ruosheng and Mu Qing?

58
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,960
I've sent people to look for them.

59
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,420
We haven't found them.

60
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,530
Find them.

61
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,380
Find them!

62
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:12,610
Yes.

63
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,960
Shao Nan, what are you doing?

64
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,210
Mr. Glasses.

65

Mr. Glasses.

66
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:30,910
What happened to your face?

67
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,190
Did you get hit?

68
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,930
Could it be my dad?

69
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,950
I'll reason with him.

70
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,960
It's okay.

71
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,870
I made a mistake.

72
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,630
Your dad is very angry right now.

73
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,090
If you talk to him now,
he'll only get angrier.

74
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,600
Let's not bring this up again.

75
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,270
Mr. Glasses.

76
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,310
Dad.

77
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,400
Why did you hit Mr. Glasses?

78
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,510
Mr. Glasses is loyal to you.

79
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,100
What's wrong?

80
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,990
It's business matter. Don't ask.

81
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,360
How big can the business be

82
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:18,040
to have made you so angry?

83
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,660
I said it's none of your business.

84
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,350
Do you think I really want to know?

85
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,460
I'm worried about your health.

86
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,730
I'm afraid you can't take it.

87
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,370
It's almost over.

88
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,230
Once we're done with this business,

89
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,130
it will be over.

[Glasses got a big slap.]

91
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:57,810
I think Glasses's face

92
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,440
will get a mark this time.

93
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:02,080
Let's go home.

94
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,180
Go home?

95

What about that lady?

96
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,460
I'll lock the door later.

Don't worry. Let's go.

99

That's really bad.

100

I knew we would be targeted by Glasses.

101
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,490
So to save Xiaoyue,

102
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,430
we should let her give Congtou a job to do

103
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,630
and make him into one of us.

104
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,270
We need to solve this problem first.

105
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,390
But...

106
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,409
How can you be so sure

107
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,820
that Xiaoyue will help us?

108
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,730
Skylark will set up a meeting

109
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:46,780
for you with Xiaoyue.

110
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,850
In the meantime,

111
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,580
I might need your team to help me.

112
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,930
Okay, I understand what you mean.

113
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,750
I'll talk to Skylark directly about this.

114
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,490
How is Skylark's condition?

115
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,570
Skylark returned

116
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:06,800
to Mr. Ou's house last night

117

She's a woman after all.

121
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,470
Protect her.

122

Don't worry about that.

123
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,590

Ma'am, why did you come downstairs?

What do we do if someone sees you?

Congtou was at the factory.

141

The three of them were acting normal.

We're still looking for her.

I said I'm still looking for her.

I told you to find her.

148

154

Did you see where she went?

00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,860
I was hurting at the time.

156
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,570
How would I know where she went?

157
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:32,940
And while I was dying,

158
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,260
I even thought of calling you.

159
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,410
That was the best I could do.

160
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,360
Is there anything you're good at?

161
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,680
Can you stop lecturing me?

162

Who would've thought she could do that?

164

She's also pregnant.

165

I've asked my men to look for her.

166

How can you ask them to look for her?

167

Tell them to stop.

168

Finding her now is like telling Glasses

that we hid Xiaoyue here.

170
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,170
Why didn't I think of that?

Why don't you go home and rest?

Let me borrow it.

345
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:38,850
Unlock it.

346
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,340
Thank you, Dad.

347
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,490
Hello.

348
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:54,470
[Hello, Mr. Liu.]

349
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,520
[It's me, Kexin.]

350
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:57,770
Sorry, about the suit I promised you,

351
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,960
I can't deliver it tomorrow.

352
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,360
I'll do it the day after tomorrow.

353
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:01,330
It's okay.

354
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:02,700
I don't need it tomorrow.

355
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,250
This isn't your phone, is it?

356
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,430
Don't mention it.

357
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,530
I couldn't find my phone.

358
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,780
I was afraid
you won't be able to reach me.

359
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,490
I borrowed my dad's phone to call you.

360
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,030
How should I contact you?

361
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:15,630
After I buy a cell phone,

362
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,770
I'll call you back.

363
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:18,310
Right.

364
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,850
I went to your office too, right?

365
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:20,950
Can you find it for me?

366
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,450
Thank you in advance.

367
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,030
That's all. Bye.

368
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:25,350
Okay.

369
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,670
Mr. Bao, inform the telecom department.

370
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,170
Tell them to change my phone number's
registered name to Liu.

371
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,290
-All right.
-Yimeng, inform Zheng Ke.

372
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,910
Tell them to trace Kexin's number.

373
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,230
Let me know when they find the location.

374
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,200
Yes.

375
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,210
Thank you, Dad.

376
00:22:45,370 --> 00:22:47,400
I'll give you a massage as a thank you.

377
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,410
[Welcome]

378
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,690
Why didn't you tell me you were going out?

379
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,270
Sir!

380
00:23:07,810 --> 00:23:08,690
If you don't stop,

381
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,630
you and your baby will get hurt.

382
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:11,910
What's going on?

383
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,060
It's nothing, just a lovers' quarrel.

384
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:15,070
Is that so?

385
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,050
Yes. You can get back to work.

386
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,170
Slow down.

387
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,000
Hello.

388
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,010
Mr. Glasses.

389
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:29,680
I got her.

390
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,110
Escort her to the ship.

391
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,390
Leave Yungang now.

392
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,800
I'm on my way.

393
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,990
[Yes.]

394
00:23:42,970 --> 00:23:43,940
Drive faster.

395
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,280
Captain Rong.

396
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,350
We lost the signal of Kexin's phone.

397
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,420
Where did the signal disappear?

398
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,750
Highway 316, near the cargo dock.

399
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,260
They are trying to ship her away.

400
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,440
Mr. Bao, Yimeng.

401
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,150
Search the cargo dock right away.

402
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,250
Prepare to rescue Xiaoyue.

403
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,400
[Yes, sir.]

404
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,680
[Captain Rong, what about me?]

405
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,590
You and I have another mission.

406
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,540
You're asking me
to catch Congtou in advance?

407
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:27,800
Okay.

408
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,170
I understand.

409
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:30,840
I'll prepare right away.

410
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,960
Hey, Congtou.

411
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,300
I already verified what you gave me.

412
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:00,320
I'll send you a location. Come over.

413
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,770
I'll give Xiaoyue back to you.

414
00:25:19,150 --> 00:25:20,070
Mr. Glasses.

415
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,430
Where is she?

416
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,230
She's on the dock.

417
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:41,060
The boat will reach here in 30 minutes.

418
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,360
When she gets on the boat,

419
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,680
let her out.

420
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,620
She's pregnant after all.

421
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,670
Don't hurt her.

422
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:49,860
Got it.

423
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:17,930
Where is she?

424
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,000
Where is the book?

425
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,950
Where is she?

426
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,090
Where's Xiaoyue?

427
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,130
You'll see her.

428
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,920
[Public Security]

429
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,620
Don't move!

430
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,680
Mu Qing.

431
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:15,660
He's one of us.

432
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,550
It's a secret.

433
00:27:38,450 --> 00:27:39,330
Be careful.

434
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,370
Yimeng, contact the coast guard now.

435
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:43,690
Ask for their assistance

436
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,960
to stop this boat.

437
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:45,930
Okay.

438
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:46,990
I'll hold them off.

439
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,350
Wait for my signal.

440
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,730
Mr. Bao, be safe.

441
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:51,920
Don't worry.

442
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,020
Start the boat.

443
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:12,770
Hey!

444
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:14,270
Who lets you park the boat here?

445
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,910
I'm talking to you!

446
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,260
Get up.

447
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,510
Who lets you park the boat here?

448
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,400
Get off the boat!

449
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:31,510
Sir, we only have a box.

450
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,610
Please make an exception.

451
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,580
No!

452
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,170
Have you registered the ship?

453
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,010
What's in the box?

454
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,260
Get off the boat!

455
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,310
Or I'll tell the police

456
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,550
that you're smuggling goods.

457
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,130
Hurry up and get off!

458
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,270
Do you hear me?

459
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,590
Get off the boat!

460
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,600
Now!

461
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,340
Move out!

462
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,660
Start the boat!

463
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:18,200
Mr. Bao, are you okay?

464
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,910
I'm okay. I'm wearing a bulletproof vest.

465
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:22,990
Inform the coast guard to go after them.

466

[Target sighted.]

467

[Yes.]

469
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,250
Sir, the suspect is heading for Pier 3.

470
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,480
Enter the port and dock.

471

Yes, sir!

472
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,840
Sir, the cabin has been inspected.

473
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,200
No suspect or hostage was found.

474
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,720
Inform Captain Rong Yao
of Task Force 84 at once.

475
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:21,820
The boat is here.

476
00:30:21,910 --> 00:30:24,200
But there are no suspects or hostages.

477
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,040
Ask him to give us the next instruction.

478
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,010
Yes.

479
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:29,210
Okay, I understand.

480
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,840
Please keep searching.

481
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:11,100
All right, stop looking.

482
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,800
If you don't bring Xiaoyue

483
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,140
to me unscathed,

484
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,750
I won't say a word.

485
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:40,670
Drive.

486
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,470
It hurts.

487
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,270
-It hurts.
-Mr. Glasses, what should we do?

488
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,590
Go get Doctor Huang.

489
00:31:56,730 --> 00:31:57,610
Go now.

490
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:04,070
She's having dystocia.

491
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,750
She was too stressed before the labor.

492
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,200
Her water broke a long time ago.

493
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:08,520
Given the situation,

494
00:32:08,650 --> 00:32:10,410
you can only save the mother or the baby.

495
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,510
Send her to the hospital.

496
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,570
It's not looking good.

497
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:13,800
Aren't you a doctor?

498
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,070
What hospital?

499
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:17,580
I can treat a small wound.

500
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,340
I'm not an obstetrician.

501
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,750
I can't deliver a baby either.

502
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:22,470
I'm not qualified.

503
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,480
I can't do it.

504
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,730
Can you do it or not?

505
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:28,490
-I...
-Answer him!

506
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,520
Sir, I...

507
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,150
I can't do it, sir.

508
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:35,800
Mr. Glasses, I don't care if I die.

509
00:32:36,150 --> 00:32:38,480
But if my baby dies,

510
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,770
do you think you can hide it

511
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,860
from the police, Congtou, and Mr. Ou?

512
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,250
Don't forget about three years ago.

513
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,230
Three years ago,

514
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:52,340
who got Ou Kexin into trouble?

515
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:01,410
What do you know?

516
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,120
If Congtou goes down,

517
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,250
do you think you can sleep peacefully?

518
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,500
Let me tell you.

519
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,270
If anything happens to me,

520
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:14,340
you, Glasses,

521
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,550
will go to the underworld with me.

522
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:26,970
Give me the gun!

523
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,700
Say that again!

524
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,240
Don't do it, Mr. Glasses!

525
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:33,790
I promise

526
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,300
that I won't say a word.

527
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,200
I just want to leave here with Congtou

528
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,510
and have a peaceful life, Mr. Glasses.

529
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:49,540
Help me.

530
00:33:52,930 --> 00:33:54,640
Help me.

531
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,330
Glasses.

532
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,970
This isn't the first time

533
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,110
you disappoint me.

534
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,390
Sir.

535
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,250
It's my fault that things got messed up.

536
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:06,440
But...

537
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,520
How did the police know where Xiaoyue was?

538
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,940
[They coincidentally showed up there.]

539
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:16,030
Plus, Congtou just happened to be missing.

540
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,900
We should keep our guard up.

541
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,880
After all,

542
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,389
Xiaoyue is in our hands.

543
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:28,040
Do you mean

544
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:30,420
Congtou betrayed us?

545
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,530
[I think that is most likely.]

546
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:35,739
[Congtou wants to leave
the group and Yungang]

547
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:37,020
[a long time ago.]

548
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,570
[He has been acting strange lately.]

549
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,380
He transferred a lot of money

550
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:43,880
to offshore accounts.

551
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,989
We need to find him as soon as possible.

552
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:51,620
No matter what,

553
00:34:52,409 --> 00:34:54,000
we can't keep Congtou.

554
00:34:55,050 --> 00:34:56,460
What other possibilities are there?

555
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:57,650
Let's hear it.

556
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,270
Mu Qing and Li Ruosheng.

557
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,120
It's possible

558
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,890
that they helped Congtou to escape.

559
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,370
But from what I know,

560
00:35:10,890 --> 00:35:12,650
they were both at home last night.

561
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:15,290
Your men told me.

562
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,140
But...

563
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,000
I'm still suspicious of those two.

564
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,020
Rong Yao.

565
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:30,430
Do you have any news?

566
00:35:30,910 --> 00:35:32,450
I just got word from the command center.

567
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,080
Xiaoyue was found by Sky Eye.

568
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:35,270
Where is she?

569
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:36,500
Renai Hospital.

570
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:37,690
I called the hospital.

571
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,790
They said she was admitted

572
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,200
to the delivery room

573
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,210
and had given birth.

574
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,010
It's a boy. Both of them are safe.

575
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,500
God is so generous to Congtou.

576
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,730
The whole family got out

577
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,630
of this life-threatening situation.

578
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:53,530
How could this rascal be so lucky?

579
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,160
Yimeng.

580
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,180
Go to the hospital now and keep her safe.

581
00:35:57,270 --> 00:35:58,410
Glasses will be anxious

582
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,870
to take Xiaoyue and the baby away.

583
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,360
Don't let them leave.

584
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,370
Okay.

585
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,270
Zhao Ran.

586
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:05,760
Let's go to the interrogation room.

587
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,130
Yes.

588
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,710
What's wrong?

589
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:27,010
Didn't I tell you?

590
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,120
If you don't bring Xiaoyue

591
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:31,540
to me unscathed,

592
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,660
I won't say a word.

593
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,130
Congtou.

594
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,160
I have good news for you.

595
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,850
Xiaoyue gave birth to a healthy boy.

596
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,610
They are both safe.

597
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,560
Congratulations on becoming a dad.

598
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,720
If you choose not to cooperate,

599
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:57,020
you won't even get to see the baby.

600
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,180
Are you lying to me?

601
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,740
What do you think?

602
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:08,910
[She can't get discharged no matter what.]

603
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,630
She's weak right now.

604
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,770
Her condition isn't stable.

605
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,750
You guys are going to be in big trouble.

606
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,660
Don't worry about that.

607
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,550
We've found a hospital

608
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,960
with better conditions.

609
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:21,890
It needs to be signed

610
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,080
by the immediate family.

611
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:24,620
How are you related to her?

612
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:26,730
If you're not her immediate family,

613
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,630
we have the right to refuse your request.

614
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:31,440
Zhu Xiaoyue, right?

615
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,630
Yes.

616
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:36,460
I'm a police officer.

617
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:37,560
I'm here to protect you.

618
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:38,530
You need to cooperate.

619
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:43,010
What if I really have to move her?

620
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:44,600
This is a hospital.

621
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,490
You can't do this here.

622
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,780
Okay. Doctor, how about this?

623
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,120
Can I talk to you over there?

624
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,270
What do you want to do?

625
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:54,720
I don't want to do anything.

626
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,130
Let me tell you something.

627
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,090
Come with me.

628
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:01,800
What about my child?

629
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:02,810
Trust us.

630
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,620
We'll make sure you two are safe.

631
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,650
Later, close your eyes.

632
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,550
Relax and don't say anything.

633
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:20,500
You should know that.

634
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,400
What happened?

635
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:31,370
She fainted.

636
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,420
We have to save her now.

637
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,320
Hold on!

638
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,990
Saving her is more important. Move aside!

639
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:37,000
Move aside.

640
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,100
Get out of the way.

641
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:41,800
Hurry!

642
00:40:13,170 --> 00:40:14,050
What are you doing?

643
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,320
This is an emergency elevator.

644
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,860
Which floor is the emergency room on?

645
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,100
It's on the 22nd floor.

646
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:35,780
Hold on.

647
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,460
Nurse.

648
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,600
What can I do for you?

649
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:41,420
The mother is in surgery.

650
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,560
It's time to breastfeed.

651
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,010
He needs to go to the nursery now.

652
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,440
Why?

653
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:48,590
Do you have any questions?

654
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,110
Wait.

655
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,380
I'll go with you.

656
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,220
You can get up.

657
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:33,510
Where's my child?

658
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,490
Don't worry. Our guys are on it.

685
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:22,410
♫ Like the four seasons in my heart ♫

686
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,800
♫ Gentle and heart-wrenching ♫

687
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:28,790
♫ What can I say? ♫

688
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:31,780
♫ At the place farthest away ♫

689
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:34,950
♫ Only then will the kites roam freely ♫

690
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,500
♫ If I gaze relentlessly ♫

691
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:40,710
♫ I wonder if there will be starlight ♫

692
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,920
♫ Standing on your spot ♫

693
00:43:44,010 --> 00:43:47,360
♫ Only then will I forget
the faraway place ♫

694
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:48,720
♫ Only your gaze ♫

695
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:51,800
♫ Can give me acknowledgment ♫

696
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:58,000
♫ Can give me an answer ♫
