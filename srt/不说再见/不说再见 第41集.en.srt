Are you really going to let

12
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,110
Kexin and Mu Qing join us?

13
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:47,920
To be honest,

14

I'm still suspicious.

Did they tell you?

As for that,

And how?

36
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,110
Is it by doing the same thing?

37
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,040
Is it asking them to swear again?

you value gratitude

176
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,410
and you're loyal.

177
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,410
If...

178
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,530
If we tell the Australian police

179
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,360
the money you spent on your sister

180
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,390
was all drug money,

181
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:14,490
Don't you dare.

182
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,810
Of course I do.

183
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,170
And I'm going to do it.

184
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,530
She's innocent.

185
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:21,570
Who can prove it?

186
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,310
Tell me. Who can prove it?

187
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,060
You keep making mistakes.

188
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,130
You thought you're giving her a good life.

189
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,850
But she's at the edge of a cliff.

190
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:39,920
If she falls, that'll be on you.

191
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,560
If you touch her, I'll kill you.

192
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,130
Whatever you're doing now,

193
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,070
your sister doesn't know yet.

194
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,270
But do you think

195
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,120
you can hide it forever?

196
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:07,940
Will you cooperate with the police?

197
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,670
That depends on you.

198
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:15,120
But I advise you to think it over.

199
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,540
How?

200
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,390
Zheng Ke, are you done?

201
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,410
Airport sounds have been added.

202
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,280
You only have one chance.

203
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:41,780
You should know what to say.

204
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,320
Three, two, one.

205
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,290
[Why are you still at the airport?]

206
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,530
Boss, the flight is delayed.

207
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:08,000
I've made a deal with Group K.

208
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,320
We can have 30%.

209
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:10,820
They'll pay us 15% up-front.

210
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,500
Good deal. Well done.

211
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,190
But I remember that you said

212
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,250
Group K isn't that reliable.

213
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,110
Yes.

214
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,230
They're not as good as we heard.

215
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,700
But their dark web system is not bad.

216
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:29,690
And Mr. Ou's daughter, Ou Kexin,

217
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,500
compared to Mr. Ou,

218
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,770
she understood us more.

219
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,270
Those were the reasons

220
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,160
why I made the deal for you.

221
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:39,460
[So it's all done?]

222
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,080
Yes. I'm waiting for you to come here.

223
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,150
In that case,

224
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,040
I'll come to Yungang.

225
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:51,870
But not now.

226
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:54,950
Why?

227
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,990
When I sent you to Yungang,

228
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,440
I was making contact

229
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,760
with another company.

230
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,880
[You should know how I work.]

231
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,520
I'm used to double insurance.

232
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,290
I always give myself more than one option.

233
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,880
Ask him.

234
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,200
So who is that?

235
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,620
That's none of your business.

236
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:18,310
When we get back to Australia,
take a break.

237
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,210
Wait for my news.

238
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,830
Boss, then I'll just...

239
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,840
There is another collaborator?

240
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,600
Can we confirm who it is?

241
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,880
Spectre didn't even tell Zhou Changhao.

242
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,290
We couldn't find anything.

243
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,160
Well, have you located Spectre?

244
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,570
The call was brief.

245
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,200
We don't have his location.

246
00:16:49,330 --> 00:16:50,560
It's a shame.

247
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,710
Aside from the recording,

248
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,030
we have no other clue.

249
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,050
If what Spectre said was true,

250
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,430
if he has other buyers,

251
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,380
then what we've been doing in Group K,

252
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:01,830
all the money we've spent,

253
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,970
were all for nothing.

254
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:06,180
And by then,

255
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,430
if we want to find Spectre again,

256
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,450
I'm afraid it'll be even harder.

257
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,920
[I thought of those as well.]

258
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,690
[So now, finding out
who's the second buyer]

259
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,010
[is our priority.]

260
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,859
I've discussed it with the directors.

261
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,480
We still need your help

262
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:21,630
to find the mystery buyer.

263
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,480
According to you,

264
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:24,880
Mr. Ou and Spectre

265
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,470
have made direct contact.

266
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,920
Be more specific.

267
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,420
[Spectre didn't tell Zhou Changhao]

268
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,970
[because he wants to keep himself safe.]

269
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,680
[But it's different for Mr. Ou.]

270
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,710
[Spectre likes double insurance.]

271
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,030
He wants buyers to compete,

272
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,350
so he can have a better price.

273
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:39,760
Come to think of it,

274
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,690
Spectre might let Mr. Ou

275
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:42,700
and the other buyer

276
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,980
know who their competitor is.

277
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:45,560
So do you think

278
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,160
Spectre told Mr. Ou?

279
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,740
You want us to use

280
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:51,200
Spectre and Mr. Ou's relationship

281
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,960
to find out who the new buyer is, right?

282
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,050
That's right.

283
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,900
We don't have much time.

284
00:17:55,990 --> 00:17:57,130
You need to move quickly.

285
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,760
We'll do our best to cooperate.

286
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,090
We must seize this opportunity.

287
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,500
Okay.

288
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,350
He just left.

289
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,900
You already think something is wrong?

290
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,570
Usually, at this point,

291
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,590
Spectre should have contacted me by now.

292
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:36,820
But now,

293
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,140
it has been over 20 hours.

294
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,370
There's no news at all.

295
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:41,930
That's why I'm suspecting.

296
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:44,960
Kexin.

297
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:47,560
When it comes to business,

298
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,710
you're still inexperienced.

299
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,290
If I were Spectre,

300
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,810
I'll try to slow things down.

301
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,070
With the current price we discussed,

302
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,150
I'll make you wait.

303
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,740
Then when you get nervous,

304
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,060
I'll have all the chance

305
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,290
to bring up the price.

306
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,030
That's why

307
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,660
we have to keep calm.

308
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,420
Even so,

309
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:17,610
at this moment,

310
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,060
we can't let our guard down.

311
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,380
Besides,

312
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,540
if we can find out when Spectre is coming,

313
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,180
we can prepare ourselves.

314
00:19:25,530 --> 00:19:27,240
We can't afford to screw up again

315
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,180
in front of Spectre.

316
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,930
Fine.

317
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,790
Do as you say.

318
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,990
After all,

319
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,010
you got us the deal.

320
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:50,300
I'll leave it up to you guys.

321
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,030
I'll contact Spectre tonight.

322
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,400
Let's get this done as soon as possible.

323
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,480
That way, we can be relieved.

324
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,670
Mr. Glasses.

325
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,700
Speak of the devil.

326
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,390
When you left this morning,
Mr. Glasses came.

327
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,800
He has been waiting for you.

328
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,480
Mr. Glasses, why are you here?

329
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:35,840
Mu Qing, I've been waiting for you.

330
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,990
Why are you waiting for me?

331
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,700
Something came up.

332
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,870
But

333
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:48,160
it's mealtime now.

334
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,540
Mu Qing, Ruosheng.

335
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,510
May I have the honor

336
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,630
to have you join me?

337
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,660
We'll talk over a meal.

338
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,520
Mr. Glasses, it's like this.

339
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:02,900
If you don't mind,

340
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:04,040
I'll order some takeout.

341
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,580
We can eat at home.

342
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:06,770
It's okay.

343
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,710
Let's eat out today.

344
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,340
Where are we going?

345
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:16,100
Relax.

346
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,250
If I want to hurt you two,

347
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,940
I wouldn't have come here myself, right?

348
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:22,300
That's not it.

349
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,320
Since Mr. Glasses wants to talk,

350
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,080
we shouldn't be standing here.

351
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:30,930
Mr. Glasses, lead the way.

352
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,510
Okay.

353
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,490
Please.

354
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,150
Guys, get in.

355
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,310
It's okay, Mr. Glasses.

356
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,540
We'll follow you.

357
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,810
Drive safely.

358
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,000
All right.

359
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:53,940
-See you later.
-See you later.

360
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,280
Come on.

361
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,350
I'm confused.

362
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,030
Tell me.

363
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,920
Didn't he try to screw with us
a few days ago?

364
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,410
But he's treating us today.

365
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,740
What is he up to?

366
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,040
Whatever it is,

367
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,410
let's just go.

368
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:29,310
What if he's up to no good?

369
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,170
If he really is,

370
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,420
that's more reason for us to go.

371
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,040
What a daredevil.

372
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,990
Guys.

373
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,850
Isn't this place nice?

374
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,920
It has a nice view.

375
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,660
Mr. Glasses.

376
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:56,900
Please get to the point.

377
00:22:59,410 --> 00:23:00,550
Mu Qing.

378
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:04,780
I always suspected that you were the mole.

379
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,280
Extreme measures were taken.

380
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:09,220
Come to think of it,

381
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,290
I was wrong.

382
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,300
I went too far.

383
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,250
Guys.

384
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:18,420
Let me pour you a drink.

385
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:35,400
I asked you here for one thing.

386
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,540
In this bag

387
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,830
is all I've gathered over the years.

388
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,590
It's data accounting.

389
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,720
All my sources

390
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,350
and their contact information.

391
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,620
It's all there.

392
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,130
Now, I'm giving it to you.

393
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:18,250
Mr. Glasses, what do you mean?

394
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,500
It's just as it sounds.

395
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,870
This morning, Mr. Glasses told me

396
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:25,600
he wants to move out and take a break.

397
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,470
He thought now you're in charge

398
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:32,600
of dealing with Spectre.

399
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,890
You shouldn't stay in the studio

400
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,070
or at Mu Qing's place.

401
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,350
It's not safe

402
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:39,460
and it's not secure.

403
00:24:39,810 --> 00:24:41,350
I think he's right.

404
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,160
You should stay here.

405
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,400
Even so,

406
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,120
he didn't have to move out.

407
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,220
Did Mr. Ou agree?

408
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:04,940
Mr. Glasses.

409
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,890
You've worked for Mr. Ou for decades.

410
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,510
Now you're leaving.

411
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,760
Was my godfather really okay with it?

412
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,150
I've been working for Mr. Ou

413
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:21,220
in the group's business.

414
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,280
After so many years,

415
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:27,900
I forgot what it's like to be worry-free.

416
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:30,460
What it's like to have beer and barbecue?

417
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,950
I can't imagine.

418
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:35,870
Mu Qing.

419
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,940
To be honest,

420
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,530
I really don't like you.

421
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,820
I even hate you a little.

422
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,810
But I have to admit,

423
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,440
you're the most talented young man

424
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:49,290
that I've ever seen.

425
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,190
This is your time now.

426
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:56,860
Our old ways of doing business,

427
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:59,280
having to use guns and risk our lives,

428
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,990
it's all gone.

429
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,680
Since I'm behind the times now,

430
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,230
why am I still holding onto this position?

431
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,370
Why don't I leave?

432
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,310
I've been wanting to do this for a while.

433
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,600
To me,

434
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,100
after so many years in this industry,

435
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,510
the fact that I'm still here

436
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,320
is a miracle.

437
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,920
Since I got the chance to get away

438
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,820
from such a dangerous life,

439
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,970
why wouldn't I leave?

440
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,900
Look at this.

441
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,590
The sun, the waves, and the beach.

442
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:41,430
This is the life I want.

443
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,720
Since he has made up his mind,

444
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,120
just let him be.

445
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,680
Kexin.

446
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,880
From now on,

447
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,850
You and Mu Qing are all I have.

448
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,270
Since you've decided

449
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,030
to take responsibility,

450
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,710
then you should

451
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,210
carry it well.

452
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:05,010
Don't worry, I will.

453
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,750
Mu Qing, Ruosheng.

454
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,250
Don't blame me for being irresponsible

455
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,540
or chickening out at the last minute.

456
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:22,300
I just think

457
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,850
it's time to go.

458
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,910
Ruosheng.

459
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,420
Why are you so quiet?

460
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:38,360
You've been working with Mu Qing,

461
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:41,400
when we had a conflict of interest,

462
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,110
it's normal for you

463
00:27:43,910 --> 00:27:45,050
to take his side.

464
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:49,540
But we're all members of the group.

465
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,620
We're brothers and family.

466
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,820
Since we're family,

467
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:57,770
it's normal to have fights.

468
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,120
Now.

469
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,250
Dakun and Tieguanyin are out.

470
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,190
Congtou is in jail too.

471
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,100
Kexin is just a girl.

472
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:14,130
Now I'm also leaving,

473
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,800
it does make things difficult for Mr. Ou.

474
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:38,550
I'm asking you two

475
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,580
for a favor.

476
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,850
You two

477
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,240
can take care of the group.

478
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,530
Mr. Glasses.

479
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,140
You played a big role in this group.

480
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,280
I don't know what to say.

481
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:02,710
It's all in the drink.

482
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,730
All the grudges of the past,

483
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,890
all our immature mistakes,

484
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,870
it's all in this drink.

485
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,140
Okay.

486
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,040
Here.

487
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,560
Mu Qing, join us.

488
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:22,330
Rest well, Mr. Glasses.

489
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,960
Leave the group to us.

490
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:45,480
We've been fighting for so long.

491
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,160
Now, Glasses just leaves
on his own accord.

492
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:50,970
I didn't know he was like that.

493
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:53,880
No way.

494
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,590
Are you saying

495
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,400
that you think

496
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:59,070
he's a loyal, honorable man

497
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:01,010
who knows when to give up?

498
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,010
That is never going to happen.

499
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,430
I just feel weird.

500
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,440
I don't know.

501
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,870
Mu Qing.

502
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,370
Tell me about it.

503
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,780
What do you think about this?

504
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:17,640
Here. Take a look.

505
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,070
The financial reports are very detailed.

506
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,400
And Glasses has a lot of connections.

507
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,310
People from all walks of life.

508
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:28,020
He basically knows everything.

509
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:31,500
But at such a critical moment,

510
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:32,990
he's such an important person.

511
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:35,500
Godfather let him go that easily.

512
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,250
Is he putting on a show for us?

513
00:30:44,870 --> 00:30:46,410
What is he trying to achieve?

514
00:30:49,670 --> 00:30:50,810
I told you.

515
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,060
Glasses is relentless.

516
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,690
But he's also very smart.

517
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,770
Now he's giving us everything he has

518
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,440
while he's out on a vacation.

519
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:02,340
He's probably doing this on purpose.

520
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,970
You never know.

521
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,040
Maybe he's doing something in secret.

522
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,820
It's safe to say that

523
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,410
Mr. Ou won't give us a hard time now.

524
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,520
But he must've turned a blind eye

525
00:31:13,870 --> 00:31:15,760
to what Glasses is up to.

526
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,830
Otherwise,

527
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,470
he wouldn't have let Glasses
leave his side so easily.

528
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:24,080
Judging from that,

529
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,790
this really could be a trap.

530
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,730
Ruosheng.

531
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,100
What kind of bait do you think

532
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,780
he has to put in the trap

533
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,140
to make us fall for it?

534
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,540
I don't know.

535
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,480
But at least,

536
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:41,060
he'll let us have a taste of success.

537
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,570
I'm glad you know.

538
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,770
The people you sent

539
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,180
to keep an eye on Glasses,

540
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,720
Glasses saw them instantly.

541
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,270
You should keep an eye on him yourself.

542
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,100
Then I'm going to go take a walk now.

543
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,810
Okay.

544
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,480
I'll go back to Ou Zhenhai's place too.

545
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:12,120
I'll keep you posted.

546
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,580
Okay.

547
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:15,690
Be safe.

548
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:27,440
Mr. Glasses.

549
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,330
You said we should deal with them.

550
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,180
But you didn't say we'd give them

551
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,360
our own hands.

552
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,780
Now, it's great.

553
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:36,590
We have nothing in hand.

554
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,610
How do we fight back now?

555
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,700
Who are we meeting with?

556
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,210
Just drive.

557
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:00,210
Don't call me again.

558
00:33:12,710 --> 00:33:15,000
Mr. Glasses, who was that guy?

559
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,510
That's not important.

560
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,130
What's important is this letter.

561
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,490
I knew it.

562
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,030
I was worried about the right thing.

563
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:35,550
Otherwise, they would have fooled us.

564
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,140
What is it?

565
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,170
See for yourself.

566
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:47,210
Yungang Biotech Research Institute.

567
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:48,310
It's a report.

568
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,110
This substance contains

569
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,310
a lot of artificial compounds.

570
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:55,170
This is an anesthetic.

571
00:33:57,190 --> 00:33:59,220
Do you remember that night

572
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,200
when Mu Qing killed the police officer?

573
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,750
You don't trust me at all, do you?

574
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:06,650
[The sample of this report.]

575
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:10,219
I took it from the gun used by Mu Qing.

576
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,330
But it was given to him by our men.

577
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,050
[How could that happen?]

578
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,260
Think about it.

579
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:20,639
Before killing the police officer,

580
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:23,420
what did they do?

581
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,300
Mu Qing.

582
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:29,800
You're not a mole.

583
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,159
You wouldn't do this to me.

584
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:34,550
Mr. Glasses, are you saying that

585
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,130
Ou Kexin helped him?

586
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,760
That's it.

587
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,540
I've had my suspicions for a while.

588
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:44,050
Our group used to be just fine.

589
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:46,300
But ever since Ou Kexin came back

590
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,190
and started hanging out with Mu Qing,

591
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,400
Dakun got in trouble and Tieguanyin too.

592
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:54,260
Mr. Glasses.

593
00:34:54,739 --> 00:34:56,679
What a coincidence. You're here too.

594
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,900
First, Ou Kexin arrived at the hospital.

595
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,370
-What happened?
-He ran away.

596
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:05,880
[Right after that,]

597
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,720
[Congtou's girlfriend, Xiaoyue,]

598
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:08,910
[was saved.]

599
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,440
Three of our Four Vajras are gone now.

600
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,610
All of that has to do

601
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,770
with Mu Qing and Ou Kexin.

602
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,710
I even suspect

603
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,830
Dakun's so-called betrayal

604
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,250
was their plan too.

605
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,010
But...

606
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:33,820
But she is Mr. Ou's daughter.

607
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,750
What if she's not?

608
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,730
She's not?

609
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:40,860
Shao Nan.

610
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,540
Help me find someone right now.

611
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,770
Her name is Bao Ma.

612
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:46,000
Who is she?

613
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,320
She is Ou Kexin's babysitter.

614
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,610
All these years,

615
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,900
she has been taking care
of Ou Kexin and her mom.

616
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,610
Three years ago,

617
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,690
after Ou Kexin's face was disfigured,

618
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:58,590
she was fired.

619
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:00,040
It's safe to say that

620
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,460
she knows Ou Kexin better than anyone.

621
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:06,770
You just said

622
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,060
I gave my hand to Mu Qing.

623
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,390
And we won't be able to fight back.

624
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,890
I'm telling you.

625
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,880
This is our hand.

626
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,450
Drive.

627
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:29,170
What?

628
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,370
Bunichi Matsumoto?

629
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,280
Mr. Spectre, what do you mean?

630
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,790
Don't you know the feud
between me and him?

631
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,830
Three years ago, he kidnapped my daughter

632
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,940
and threatened me to leave Southeast Asia.

633
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:44,570
I did everything he asked for,

634
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:46,240
but he didn't keep his word

635
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,950
and disfigured my daughter.

636
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,900
I haven't dealt with him
for what he has done.

637
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,630
If you insist on working with him,

638
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,790
then you've crossed my line.

639
00:36:56,670 --> 00:36:57,900
I won't let it slide.

640
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:04,850
Dad.

641
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,960
Is it really Matsumoto?

642
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,750
What a terrible coincidence.

643
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,170
Are you sure it's Matsumoto?

644
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,230
Okay, I'll contact the station right away.

645
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,380
[Director Wang.]

646
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,010
[Bunichi Matsumoto]

647
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,030
[is one of Asia's top three drug lords.]

648
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,440
[They're tough to deal with.]

649
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,510
[Luckily, Rong Yu and Yuanwen]

650
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,310
[let me know immediately.]

651
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:43,300
[It gave us some time]

652
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,800
[to get prepared.]

653
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,960
What's your suggestion?

654
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,500
[I think]

655
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:51,360
we have to find a good reason

656
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:52,760
to make Ou Zhenhai

657
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,140
allow them to go to Japan together.

658
00:37:55,670 --> 00:37:58,090
If Spectre hasn't contacted Matsumoto yet,

659
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,890
we'll move in first

660
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:01,080
and stop this meeting.

661
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,840
[What if Spectre]

662
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,790
[has gotten in touch with Matsumoto?]

663
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,680
Then we'll have evidence of Matsumoto

664
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,570
doing drug-related crimes.

665
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,460
Then Yuanwen and Rong Yu

666
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:12,740
can help Japanese police

667
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,640
to arrest Spectre and Matsumoto.

668
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,710
I agree with your suggestion.

669
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,570
But about the operation,

670
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,510
I need to speak to the others

671
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,920
before we make our decision.

672
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,150
I also need time

673
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,610
to communicate with the Japanese.

674
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,340
Tell Yuanwen to be ready.

675
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:31,660
Stand by for order.

676
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,890
[Yes.]

677
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:34,340
Sir.

678
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,280
These are my thoughts and suggestions.

679
00:38:38,130 --> 00:38:39,230
Okay.

680
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,430
When are you planning to leave?

681
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,360
Soon.

682
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,770
Don't worry.

683
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:47,150
I won't let Matsumoto get what he wanted.

684
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,960
Dad, I'm going too.

685
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,060
Nonsense.

686
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:53,170
I'll go wherever Mu Qing is.

687
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:54,850
It's not the time for tantrums.

688
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,440
I'll never forget it.

689
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:59,420
Three years ago, because of him,

690
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:00,650
I almost died in that fire.

691
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:02,020
I must have my revenge.

692
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,360
That's not for you to do.

693
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,680
Dad.

694
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,600
I'll avenge you, Kexin.

695
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,090
Listen to Mr. Ou.

696
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,280
Stay by his side.

697
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:14,430
Wait for me.

698
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,890
Mu Qing, Matsumoto is crafty.

699
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:23,270
When you're there,

700
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:25,470
don't deal with him directly at first.

701
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,490
If there's no other way,

702
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,490
use extreme measures.

703
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,300
He sees me as a thorn in his side.

704
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,900
He really wants me dead.

705
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:38,710
If things get out of hand,

706
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:42,670
you can pretend to surrender to him.

707
00:39:42,810 --> 00:39:44,040
Earn his trust.

708
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,630
Everyone knows you now.

709
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:49,190
He should know how valuable you are.

710
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:52,090
For the rest,

711
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,160
just play it by ear.

712
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,270
But be careful.

713
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,380
Yes, sir.

714
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,610
Mr. Glasses.

715
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,750
When I wake up in the morning,

716
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,250
I'll go jogging first.

717
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:45,500
After my first run, I couldn't breathe.

718
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,400
My body couldn't handle it.

719
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,160
But I'm much better now.

720
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,920
After breakfast,

721
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,120
I watched television and went for a walk.

722
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,270
In the afternoon,

723
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:56,940
I like to come to the beach.

724
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:59,100
Look at these young people.

725
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,520
They like taking wedding photos here.

726
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:05,170
Their happy lives have just begun.

727
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:09,530
That normal life is what I want.

728
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,560
Mr. Glasses.

729
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,660
You don't have to do this.

730
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:19,340
If it's yours, it's yours.

731
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,540
Nobody can take it away from you.

732
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,930
You earned everything with hard work.

733
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:27,130
But you gave it to us for nothing.

734
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,360
I know.

735
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,650
You must feel terrible.

736
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:32,940
I did this

737
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,090
so you can be relieved.

738
00:41:35,270 --> 00:41:36,680
But you after you did this,

739
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:38,260
I'm even more worried.

740
00:41:38,350 --> 00:41:39,670
What should I do?

741
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,040
Must I die for Mu Qing to be at ease?

742
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:43,850
That's not what I meant.

743
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,060
I used to be like Mu Qing.

744
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,870
I was always thinking of ways
to deal with you.

745
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:53,000
But you played a big role in the group.

746
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,670
You made your sacrifice.

747
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:56,120
To be honest,

748
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:57,350
you have my respect.

749
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,130
Now that you're retired,

750
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,590
I can't seem to get over it.

751
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:04,130
What do you want to do then?

752
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:06,730
Are you going to give me back

753
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,000
the things I gave away?

754
00:42:08,490 --> 00:42:09,760
I did think about that.

755
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:13,280
["The Place Farthest Away" playing]

756
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:15,090
♫ Against the light ♫

757
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,080
♫ Your vague silhouette ♫

758
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:20,850
♫ I reach out with my hands ♫

759
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:24,280
♫ But my hug passes through you ♫

760
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,920
♫ Maybe this is an illusion ♫

761
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:30,310
♫ A sweet dream ♫

762
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,910
♫ Waiting for you ♫

763
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:36,290
♫ To notice it and wake me up ♫

764
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:39,110
♫ I wonder if getting close to you ♫

765
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,490
♫ One swirl will light up the stars ♫

766
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:48,220
♫ I wonder if someone
will tell you for me ♫

767
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:54,420
♫ At the place farthest away ♫

768
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:57,590
♫ Only then will the kites roam freely ♫

769
00:42:57,770 --> 00:43:00,050
♫ If I gaze relentlessly ♫

770
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:03,000
♫ I wonder if there will be starlight ♫

771
00:43:03,090 --> 00:43:06,130
♫ If the falling fireworks ♫

772
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:09,470
♫ Give me the sadness of being lonely ♫

773
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:11,230
♫ If your gaze gives me ♫

774
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,130
♫ A sense of direction ♫

775
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:18,800
♫ I'll give you an answer too ♫

776
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:33,140
♫ Looking at your turbulent silence ♫

777
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,120
♫ I really hope you can understand ♫

778
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:45,420
♫ So I remain extremely quiet and gentle ♫

779
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:51,580
♫ Waiting for you to kiss my forehead ♫

780
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:54,000
♫ It seems you're in front of me ♫

781
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,900
♫ Like the four seasons in my heart ♫

782
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,940
♫ Gentle and heart-wrenching ♫

783
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:03,240
♫ What can I say? ♫

784
00:44:03,320 --> 00:44:06,180
♫ At the place farthest away ♫

785
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:09,480
♫ Only then will the kites roam freely ♫

786
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,040
♫ If I gaze relentlessly ♫

787
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:15,340
♫ I wonder if there will be starlight ♫

788
00:44:15,470 --> 00:44:18,280
♫ Standing on your spot ♫

789
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:21,720
♫ Only then will I forget
the faraway place ♫

790
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,950
♫ Only your gaze ♫

791
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:26,250
♫ Can give me acknowledgment ♫

792
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:32,580
♫ Can give me an answer ♫
