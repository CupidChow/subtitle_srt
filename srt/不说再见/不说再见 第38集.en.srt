[Episode 38]

3
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,840
Let's hurry.

4
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,370
Hurry!

5
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,690
Hurry!

6
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,070
Hold on.

7
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,080
Here. Let's go.

8
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,750
Hurry!

9
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,470
Slow down.

10
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:18,900
Hurry.

11
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,520
Retreat.

12
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,320
I'll do it. Let go.

13
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,410
[Shao Nan, we've handled him.]

14
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,390
[We've cleaned up the blood.]

15
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,800
[We got the bullet shell too.]

16
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:45,300
Okay.

17
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,400
Tonight, we're drinking

18
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,080
to make Mu Qing feel better.

19
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,860
Come on, one more.

20
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,040
Bottoms up.

21
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,280
We've gotten through this round.

22
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,000
But Spectre is coming.

23
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,079
Between us and Glasses,

24
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,670
there's going to be a fight.

25
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,380
I hope that the three of us

26
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:31,140
can work together.

27
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,300
From now on,

28
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:35,980
I'll have two strategists.

29
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,010
To both of you.

30
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,570
Here.

31
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,960
Cheers.

32
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,210
You have to drink another one.

33
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,900
You have to drink alone.

34
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:07,440
I'm making a toast

35
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,210
to my new female strategist.

36
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,170
You drink up. I won't.

37
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,270
Kexin and Li Ruosheng were both there?

38
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,220
How did the words get out?

39
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,420
When they were getting the police officer,

40
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,920
Li Ruosheng showed up.

41
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,720
It really was a coincidence.

42
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,310
So...

43
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:39,340
Kexin was there when that officer died?

44
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:40,750
Yes.

45
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:45,630
I'm sorry, sir.

46
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,350
I didn't have it under control.

47
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,580
I'll accept my punishment.

48
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,710
She got involved in the business

49
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,760
and saw blood.

50
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,070
Kexin has basically entered our business.

51
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,820
Forget it.

52
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,510
I'll talk to her again.

53
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,710
I think

54
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,390
it's time for you to work

55
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,620
with the two of them.

56
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,400
Say what you want to say.

57
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,070
Sir.

58
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,790
I think

59
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:23,600
although Mu Qing has proved his loyalty,

60
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,980
his behavior at the scene

61
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,300
still makes me suspicious.

62
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,310
Besides,

63
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,640
we never caught the mole.

64
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,270
I'll have to look into it.

65
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,360
[They've made Mu Qing prove his loyalty.]

66
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,260
But Ou Zhenhai won't stop

67
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,620
until he catches the mole.

68
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:47,100
Since Mr. Ou is so obsessed with the mole,

69
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,390
we might as well give him one.

70
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,510
It seems you've prepared for it.

71
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,010
That's right.

72
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:57,170
Take a look, Director Liu.

73
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,990
His name is Zhou Kang,

74
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,130
also known as Bull.

75
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,890
He has worked for Glasses for two years.

76
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,530
He usually keeps a low profile.

77
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,470
Why did you choose him?

78
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,630
I've checked everyone in Group K.

79
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,840
Not many know how the group operate

80
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,830
or close to one of the Four Vajras.

81
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,330
This guy called Zhou Kang

82
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,040
has to be a perfect choice.

83
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,370
But he's Glasses's guy.

84
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:23,000
That's the point.

85
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,070
Making him the mole

86
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,310
will make Glasses embarrass himself

87
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,160
in front of Mr. Ou.

88
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,320
Everything that happened to Yuanwen

89
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,330
was his fault after all.

90
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:35,940
Okay.

91
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:37,650
Let's go with your plan.

92
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,810
-Don't move!
-Freeze!

93
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,750
Stop right there!

94
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:45,220
Don't move!

95
00:06:46,810 --> 00:06:47,730
Get off the bed.

96
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,680
It's okay now.

97
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,740
Come on.

98
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,650
Mr. Glasses, we're in trouble.

99
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,760
Bull was arrested.

100
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,180
When?

101
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,190
Earlier tonight.

102
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,000
I couldn't reach him two days ago.

103
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,850
So I sent two guys to look for him.

104
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,090
I found out he was taken by the police.

105
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:09,260
Later on, we found this on his bed.

106
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,120
What do you mean?

107
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,370
They checked his phone records.

108
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,080
There is a number in there.

109
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:21,490
They spoke quite often.

110
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,870
Two days before Guanyin's arrest,

111
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:25,270
he made a lot of calls

112
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,590
to this number as well.

113
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:28,400
They called the number,

114
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,940
but the other guy didn't speak.

115
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,700
But we heard sirens in the background.

116
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,850
Then they hung up.

117
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,530
That means

118
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,549
it must be the police.

119
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:40,669
In that case,

120
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,650
could Bull be an undercover agent?

121
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,460
He could be the mole.

122
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,530
Then everything makes sense.

123
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,910
If he's an undercover agent,

124
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,360
why would the police arrest him?

125
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,860
That's right.

126
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,200
So he can't be an undercover agent.

127
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,740
He might be an informant.

128
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,060
If he was an undercover agent,

129
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,470
we would've been arrested.

130
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,900
It's fine.

131
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,800
He doesn't know a lot.

132
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:29,340
Keep your eyes on him.

133
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:32,060
If he's released,

134
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,180
make him disappear for good.

135
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,450
I understand.

136
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,210
What about Mu Qing?

137
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:39,720
Keep watching him.

138
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,220
And don't tell anyone

139
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,640
about this.

140
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:45,660
Yes.

141
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,010
Have a seat.

142
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,890
It's this dish again. Let's have peace.

143
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,650
Let's have a toast first.

144
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,830
This is good wine.

145
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,890
Sir.

146
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,220
You certainly prepared

147
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,280
a fine bottle of alcohol.

148
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,120
You have good taste.

149
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,490
Guess what it is.

150
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,160
I tasted the flavor.

151
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,230
It's very aromatic.

152
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:05,820
There must be something else in it.

153
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:08,070
It's certainly not on the market.

154
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,960
I'm sorry.

155
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:11,540
I still can't figure it out.

156
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,700
What about you two?

157
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,240
I...

158
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:18,230
Godfather, they all taste the same to me.

159
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,480
I'll drink it as long as it's good.

160
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,340
What about you, Mu Qing?

161
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,600
Although I don't know what brand it is,

162
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,060
I think

163
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,920
it should be called "Harmony."

164
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,260
"Harmony"?

165
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,160
Sitting here and having a meal with you

166
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,970
is already my pleasure.

167
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,290
Of course.

168
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,870
Mr. Glasses is very forgiving

169
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,630
and Ruosheng helped me a lot.

170
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,520
But most importantly,

171
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,810
it's because Mr. Ou chose to trust me.

172
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,800
It's all about harmony.

173
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:53,470
Harmony brings wealth.

174
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,450
Well said.

175
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,270
What Mu Qing said really touched my heart.

176
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,130
Harmony brings wealth.

177
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,150
I'm sure everyone feels the same way.

178
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,390
Cheers.

179
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,440
Drink up.

180
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:10,850
Mu Qing.

181
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,890
Suspecting you and hurting you

182
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:15,610
was never personal.

183
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,760
That was for the safety of the group.

184
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,490
You need to understand Glasses.

185
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,730
Of course I understand.

186
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,770
Mr. Glasses is a senior in the group.

187
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,400
His strategy and experience

188
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,290
are for us youngsters to learn from.

189
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,590
Mr. Glasses.

190
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,140
Please continue

191
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:36,680
to take care of us from now on.

192
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,280
We take care of each other.

193
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,330
Cheers.

194
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,200
We toasted and drank.

195
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,270
We're still brothers.

196
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,460
No one should be holding grudges.

197
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:53,050
Of course.

198
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,590
If Mr. Ou says so,

199
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,010
we'll do our best from now on.

200
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,810
Am I right, you two?

201
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:00,040
Mr. Glasses is right.

202
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:01,890
Godfather.

203
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,700
Mu Qing is back now

204
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,320
and he has proved his loyalty.

205
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,570
I hope

206
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,680
that we can get back

207
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:11,400
to contribute to the group soon.

208
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:13,640
But lately, I feel like

209
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,710
we don't have the tool for it.

210
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,730
Just say whatever you have in mind.

211
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:18,960
It's nothing.

212
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,440
Our only hope is to get back

213
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,020
the dark web system.

214
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,300
What do you think?

215
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,260
I think

216
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,460
Mu Qing went missing for a month

217
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,050
and hadn't been in the group,

218
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:39,860
so he might not be able

219
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,270
to handle our current business.

220
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:46,200
But all of this is up to you, sir.

221
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,620
Mu Qing.

222
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,880
Logically speaking,

223
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,520
the dark web system

224
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,200
was created by you and Ruosheng.

225
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:03,090
You're back now.

226
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,470
The dark web system should be yours again.

227
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,410
But Glasses has a point.

228
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:09,960
You left the group for a month.

229
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:12,160
Whether you can still handle the business

230
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,650
is also my concern.

231
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,770
Sir.

232
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,050
The dark web system doesn't belong to me,

233
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,470
Ruosheng, or Mr. Glasses.

234
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,880
It belongs to the group.

235
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,170
Supposedly,

236
00:14:24,390 --> 00:14:26,190
whoever is in charge of the dark web

237
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,040
makes money for the group.

238
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:32,440
But I heard about it yesterday.

239
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,290
In the past month,

240
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,060
the trading volume in our dark web system

241
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,700
dropped by more than 30%.

242
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,310
-Sir.
-Hold on.

243
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:45,640
Is that true?

244
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:46,870
Yes.

245
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,500
It's like this.

246
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,920
It's very risky now.

247
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:52,370
Our old customers

248
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,820
are either arrested or on the run.

249
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,450
Our current trading volume

250
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,820
is pretty decent.

251
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,440
I also heard

252
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,120
that just over the border,

253
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,880
people are also using the dark web

254
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,840
for their business.

255
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:05,310
And they're getting better at it.

256
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,770
Mr. Glasses.

257
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:10,150
The whole country
is fighting against drugs.

258
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,390
Why is our volume dropping so badly,

259
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,200
while they're doing just fine

260
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,820
at the border?

261
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,230
Mu Qing.

262
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:19,340
It is Mr. Ou

263
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,590
who lays the groundwork for our business.

264
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,570
It's not for you to judge.

265
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,110
That's enough.

266
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,620
Mu Qing is right.

267
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,120
The group's business is our business.

268
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,900
I'll let the thing about the dark web go.

269
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,100
Don't feel too much pressure.

270
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,040
How about this?

271
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:40,820
I'll return

272
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,710
the dark web system to you two.

273
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,600
Do whatever it takes.

274
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,490
Bring the trading volume up.

275
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,160
But there's one thing.

276
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,790
Glasses is still in charge

277
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,330
of the accounting.

278
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,830
He'll brief me.

279
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:54,100
Is there a problem?

280
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,080
-No, sir.
-No problem.

281
00:15:57,620 --> 00:15:59,380
Spectre will come to Yungang soon.

282
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,290
I don't want another unwanted accident.

283
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:05,150
The three of you must work together.

284
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,130
Otherwise, I won't go easy on you.

285
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,670
Godfather, don't worry.

286
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:09,850
Don't worry, sir.

287
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:10,870
Okay.

288
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,670
Let's move on.

289
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,740
Let's have another glass and eat.

290
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,230
Here.

291
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,410
Try the fish first.

292
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,650
Let's enjoy the peace.

293
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,540
Let's eat.

294
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:28,600
After you.

295
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,730
What's wrong?

296
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:37,790
You've been quiet for half a day.

297
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,430
You're still upset, aren't you?

298
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,860
Don't worry.

299
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:50,070
If it's yours, it's still yours.

300
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,920
I asked you to stay

301
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,810
to tell you something important.

302
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,960
What is it?

303
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,990
I got a call from Spectre this morning.

304
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,510
Spectre isn't coming to Yungang,

305
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,710
but one of his men will.

306
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,900
His name is Zhou Changhao.

307
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,520
Zhou Changhao?

308
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,260
[He's Spectre's right-hand man.]

309
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:11,940
[He also helped Spectre]

310
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,740
[develop the new drug.]

311
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,660
[This time, he's here to test us.]

312
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,550
He's already in Yungang.

313
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,960
If he's already here,

314
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,980
why didn't he contact us?

315
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,829
Don't be nervous.

316
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,980
Currently, Spectre is wanted

317
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,349
by every country in the world.

318
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,710
He has to be careful.

319
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:31,690
Besides,

320
00:17:31,910 --> 00:17:33,850
he's here to check on us.

321
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,440
He arrived earlier and didn't tell us

322
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,000
so he could catch us off guard

323
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,540
and we wouldn't have time to prepare.

324
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:44,010
But...

325
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,170
investigating from outside the group

326
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,310
is not that easy.

327
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,350
I think in three days,

328
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,280
he will contact me.

329
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,120
But three of our four Vajras

330
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,590
have fallen in the past months.

331
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,670
If Zhou Changhao finds out,

332
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,130
I'm worried that...

333
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,900
What happened

334
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,490
to Dakun, Congtou, and Tieguanyin

335
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,170
is our group matter after all.

336
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,500
If you can get the sales up,

337
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,140
no matter who the Vajras are

338
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,240
or how many there are,

339
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,320
I don't think Spectre will care.

340
00:18:22,330 --> 00:18:23,260
That's why

341
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,020
I'm counting on you for the next few days.

342
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,880
You, Ruosheng, and Mu Qing should discuss.

343
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:29,950
See if they can find more buyers

344
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:31,270
on the dark web.

345
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,420
Fix the things that have been delayed

346
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,790
as soon as possible.

347
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,850
I understand.

348
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,440
I'm on it.

349
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,160
We just got the dark web back

350
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,270
and Glasses asked us to find buyers.

351
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,910
Why is he in such a hurry?

352
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:07,870
I also find it strange.

353
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,560
I've never seen Glasses being so nervous.

354
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,570
It must be about what you said
during the meal.

355
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:17,600
You said the dark web wasn't doing well.

356
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:19,090
It didn't do well

357
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,760
when Glasses was in charge.

358
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,260
What does it have to do with us?

359
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,200
It didn't matter before.

360
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,400
But we've taken over it again.

361
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:29,040
We must handle all the problems ourselves.

362
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,460
We're cleaning up for him.

363
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,420
Mr. Ou treated us today.

364
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,040
Obviously, he wants us

365
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:39,070
to make peace with Glasses.

366
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,710
Then Glasses asked us

367
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,070
to do the accounting better.

368
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,800
Do you think

369
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:48,000
Spectre is already in Yungang?

370
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,240
I'm not sure.

371
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,370
If Spectre is really here

372
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,180
and Glasses didn't tell us,

373
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,330
there's only one possibility.

374
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,750
He doesn't want us
to make contact with Spectre.

375
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,030
That's right.

376
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,510
So how can we figure out

377
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,970
whether Spectre is in town or not?

378
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,670
Let's try something first.

379
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,070
Do you remember my hacker friend?

380
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,220
The "old guy"?

381
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,500
It's "old man."

382
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:27,600
Right, "old man."

383
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,680
I can ask them to help us

384
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:31,820
find some retail buyers.

385
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,490
They'll have a discount,

386
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:34,900
but this can solve our problem.

387
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,290
What about the money?

388
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,710
We'll just

389
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,820
have to bleed a little.

390
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:44,230
Hold on.

391
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,460
You mean

392
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,760
we'll use these fake buyers

393
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,920
and our own money

394
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,540
to buy our own goods?

395
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:54,520
Is that what you mean?

396
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,280
That would mean

397
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,690
we'll be giving Glasses our money.

398
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,040
We're not giving it to Glasses for free.

399
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,930
We'll be using Glasses

400
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,080
to gain Mr. Ou's trust.

401
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,550
It will help us meet Spectre.

402
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,420
No, I don't agree with this.

403
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,460
Are you afraid of losing money?

404
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,170
We'll lose a lot.

405
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,940
Maybe we'll go bankrupt

406
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,620
before we even get to meet Spectre.

407
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,080
How would this make you go bankrupt?

408
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:24,930
I'll return to you

409
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,560
twice the amount of money you put in.

410
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,570
What do you think?

411
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,580
What's the guarantee?

412
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,360
Fine.

413
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,580
I'll put in my money.

414
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,320
I think you're right.

415
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,410
Mr. Glasses increases the trading volume

416
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:53,440
at this moment.

417
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:54,800
Why now?

418
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,390
It's most likely

419
00:21:56,470 --> 00:21:57,750
because Spectre is coming.

420
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,430
Then...

421
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:03,210
You keep dealing with Glasses.

422
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,050
I'll go back to Mr. Ou's house later

423
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,770
and test him more.

424
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,850
Okay, let's do that.

425
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,900
But you must be careful.

426
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,100
You've just returned to Group K.

427
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,860
If Glasses holds grudges,

428
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,270
I'm afraid he'll get in your way.

429
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:21,600
Don't you trust me?

430
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:24,150
I don't trust Glasses.

431
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,860
If I can't even handle Glasses,

432
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,790
how can I stay and help you?

433
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,550
Just wait and see.

434
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,580
I'll get going.

435
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:55,430
Captain Rong, there's a situation!

436
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,320
What's wrong?

437
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,430
The agent asked for fake buyers.

438
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,570
Grant it.

439
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,600
-Yes.
-Notify all police stations.

440
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,920
Have them distribute the drugs.

441
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,970
Okay.

442
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,260
Come on.

443
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,120
Hurry up and be careful.

444
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,610
Hurry up.

445
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,060
You guys.

446
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,780
Come on.

447
00:25:08,350 --> 00:25:09,280
Be careful.

448
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,140
What is this?

449
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,720
Take a look, Mr. Glasses.

450
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,760
This is from Wuyi Mountain's tea farmer.

451
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:25,780
I just bought it.

452
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,800
It's the most precious Da Hong Pao.

453
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,230
Mu Qing.

454
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:33,920
You managed to buy something so nice.

455
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:35,500
You're really sincere.

456
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,400
Mr. Glasses.

457
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:41,570
Before this at Mr. Ou's dining table,

458
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,980
I didn't do you any good.

459
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,930
It's because I was holding a grudge.

460
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,920
But after thinking about it,

461
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:51,030
I put myself in your shoes.

462
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,480
If I were you,

463
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,930
I would have done the same thing.

464
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,400
It's all for the safety of the group.

465
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:57,980
That's why

466
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,230
I think I should apologize to you.

467
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:03,000
Ruosheng told me that you like tea.

468
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,930
So I brought this little gift.

469
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,210
It's not that good.

470
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,150
I'll get something better for you.

471
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,570
You're too kind.

472
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:12,410
-Hurry.
-A few days ago,

473
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:15,230
Mr. Ou talked to me.

474
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,870
We're in the same group.

475
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:20,600
We work together under the same roof.

476
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:22,090
So...

477
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,380
I need to forget about the past

478
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:25,970
and let go of my pride.

479
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,640
Let's stop dwelling on the past

480
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:29,400
and stop fighting with each other.

481
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,270
Mu Qing, I'll be honest.

482
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,630
If you hadn't come,

483
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,260
I would've gone to see you anyway.

484
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:39,380
Mr. Glasses, I can't let you come to me.

485
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:41,580
From now on, I'll bring you tea every day.

486
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,560
Okay.

487
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,420
Thank you for the tea.

488
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,300
Go.

489
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:51,790
Go.

490
00:27:04,510 --> 00:27:07,020
Mu Qing, you're really something.

491
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,470
You found so many buyers

492
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,100
in such a short time.

493
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:13,440
I realize that I'm old.

494
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,510
I can't compete with young ones like you.

495
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,140
Mr. Glasses.

496
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,250
If you weren't a reliable supplier,

497
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,880
no matter how many clients I found,

498
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,640
the goods wouldn't get to leave Yungang.

499
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,400
Don't flatter me.

500
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:25,980
Tell me.

501
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,270
How did you get so many clients?

502
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,040
I have my own connections.

503
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,270
And my connections

504
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,460
have their connections too.

505
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:35,530
It's just a net.

506
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,830
Likewise, relationships are like a net.

507
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,950
If we can pick up the corners,

508
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,190
then we'll have the whole net.

509
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:49,120
So you're a fisherman?

510
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,070
You could say that.

511
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,110
Mu Qing.

512
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:56,870
This time,

513
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,370
you've done me a huge favor.

514
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:03,640
I always repay kindness with kindness.

515
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,410
If anything happens in the future,

516
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,530
you can come to me.

517
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,290
Mr. Glasses.

518
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,410
I don't need anything from you.

519
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:21,370
But...

520
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,570
I heard that Spectre

521
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,890
is coming in a few days.

522
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,270
We heard you and Mr. Ou

523
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,720
talk about Spectre a lot.

524
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,390
I idolized him.

525
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:33,650
I wonder if we can have a chance

526
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,930
to meet him?

527
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,130
Spectre isn't coming this time.

528
00:28:37,210 --> 00:28:38,840
He sent one of his men.

529
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:41,520
Their purpose is to test us out.

530
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:45,920
Does Spectre always do that?

531
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,250
You don't need to know about this matter.

532
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,180
Just do your job,

533
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,500
and I'll do mine.

534
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:56,880
After we're done with this,

535
00:28:56,970 --> 00:28:59,430
we'll have the great tea that you gave me.

536
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:01,760
Okay, Mr. Glasses.

537
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:02,820
It's a deal.

538
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,000
Why are you asking about Spectre?

539
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,800
I'm just asking.

540
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,910
Why are you overreacting?

541
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,190
It's not for you to ask.

542
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,700
You've been talking about him.

543
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,720
Why can't I ask?

544
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,920
Besides, I've been involved

545
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:27,150
with the group's business.

546
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:29,310
The customers support me a lot.

547
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,290
I've helped you quite a lot too.

548
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,020
So...

549
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,300
For such a big deal,

550
00:29:36,830 --> 00:29:38,770
I feel like I should be a part of it.

551
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,390
Instead of a peaceful life,

552
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,890
why are you choosing this?

553
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,250
I'm telling you.

554
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,010
If you mention Spectre again,

555
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,330
I'll send you abroad right away.

556
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,300
"Send you abroad."

557
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:48,710
You always say that.

558
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,470
If you really send me away,

559
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,700
Li Ruosheng and Mu Qing

560
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:53,420
will be bullied by Mr. Glasses.

561
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:57,330
Besides,

562
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,890
two people are more powerful than one.

563
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:02,350
I can give you a hand if I stay with you.

564
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:03,980
What's wrong with you?

565
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,430
Don't you understand what I said?

566
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,420
Fine.

567
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:10,970
I'll stop asking if you want me to.

568
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,250
You don't have to be so mad.

569
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:18,850
Three lines in the middle

570
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,650
and three lines on top.

571
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,720
You're turning into a tiger.

572
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:24,570
You'll get wrinkles

573
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:25,800
if you keep getting mad.

574
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,460
All right, don't be mad.

575
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,390
As long as you don't send me abroad,

576
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,060
I'll be a good daughter.

577
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,250
I won't ask anything.

578
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,200
-You're still ignoring me?
-Fine.

579
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,060
I spent so much money.

580
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,520
But I can't even meet

581
00:30:57,610 --> 00:30:58,840
Spectre's minion in the end.

582
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,880
Mu Qing, this is on you.

583
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,680
You have to pay me back.

584
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,030
Okay, I'll pay you back.

585
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,520
Let's check.

586
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,370
Do I have anything valuable?

587
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,520
My body parts or organs.

588
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,750
Cut them off and sell them.

589
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,600
Aren't you ashamed?

590
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,620
You really overestimate yourself.

591
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:18,120
All of your organs combined

592
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,170
and your prostate,

593
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,540
how much can you sell them for?

594
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,430
Only Kexin finds you valuable.

595
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,920
Why are you so smug?

596
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:24,980
Kexin.

597
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:27,000
Come and take a look. He's for sale.

598
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,060
How much can you give me?

599
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,420
I'll take anything.

600
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,620
You're so noisy.

601
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,180
I'm telling you.

602
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,510
Qingqing is mine all along.

603
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,870
Who said you could sell him?

604
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,760
Have some fruit.

605
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:41,920
I want some too.

606
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,150
Get it yourself.

607
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,020
But I thought about it.

608
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:48,690
We have to find a way.

609
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,810
When I went to see my dad,

610
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,300
he was tight-lipped.

611
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,370
He wouldn't even say a word.

612
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:55,820
I'm guessing

613
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,070
that he and Glasses

614
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,910
want to see Spectre's man.

615
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:01,280
And they decided that

616
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,470
they won't let us meet him.

617
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:07,220
Godfather can meet with Spectre.

618
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,240
There's nothing wrong with that.

619
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,490
But why take Glasses with him?

620
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,420
If Glasses meets Spectre's man,

621
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:15,140
he'll be able to fly.

622
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,680
You don't want Glasses to go.

623
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,220
Can you stop him?

624
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,630
I can't.

625
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:23,280
But we can't sit by and let him.

626
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,340
Here.

627
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,260
I'm troubled here.

628
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,410
Stop showing off your affection here.

629
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:40,660
You should leave.

630
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,370
Go back to your house. Go on.

631
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,190
-Go back.
-Why are you making us leave?

632
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,870
-Go.
-Do you think we want to stay here?

633
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:51,260
-What is that attitude?
-Go home and be lovey-dovey.

634
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:52,580
You're so petty.

635
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:53,720
Clean it up yourself.

636
00:32:53,810 --> 00:32:54,780
You cheapskate.

637
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,920
Let's go.

638
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,680
What Ruosheng said reminded me

639
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,480
that if we can't go easy on him,

640
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,680
then we should do it the hard way.

641
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,820
Tackle him from the base, right?

642
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:14,710
That's right.

643
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,570
To Glasses,

644
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,860
the problem is his customers.

645
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,840
Through the dark web,

646
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,220
you and Rong Yao

647
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,550
have given him enough customers.

648
00:33:26,990 --> 00:33:28,570
But now,

649
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,260
if we remove the base for his entire work,

650
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:33,630
which is his factories,

651
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,800
then it might be a huge problem for him

652
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,750
to keep his business running.

653
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,880
I agree with you.

654
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,430
But Glasses's new factories

655
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,930
are more discreet.

656
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:51,050
If we send the police in,

657
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:53,610
he'll suspect that there's a mole.

658
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:56,690
That's why we can't do this

659
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,020
from the inside.

660
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:01,790
We have to do it from the outside.

661
00:34:03,990 --> 00:34:04,910
How do we do that?

662
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:07,330
Do you remember

663
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:08,480
that traffic officer

664
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:09,969
from my loyalty test last time?

665
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:17,719
No.

666
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:18,909
Next.

667
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:22,469
No.

668
00:34:22,730 --> 00:34:23,699
Next.

669
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,429
Did you see it clearly?

670
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:27,570
No.

671
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,350
No.

672
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,900
Pass.

673
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,150
Pass.

674
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:38,750
Pass.

675
00:34:40,290 --> 00:34:41,210
Stop.

676
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,100
That's him.

677
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,820
Are you sure?

678
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,230
Yes.

679
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:18,610
I thought if I hid for a while,

680
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,240
this would blow over.

681
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:22,090
I never thought

682
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,080
you would still catch me.

683
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:27,500
All right.

684
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,390
I admit

685
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,240
that I transport goods for Group K.

686
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,130
Officers.

687
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,890
I want to redeem myself.

688
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,390
I'll make a deal.

689
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:38,590
That's for the best.

690
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:40,570
You need to tell us now.

691
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,600
Where does Group K produce the drugs?

692
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,760
I know that place.

693
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:48,620
I used to transport ephedra to Glasses.

694
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,420
Yes, it was shipped there.

695
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:51,830
Where is it?

696
00:36:11,630 --> 00:36:13,790
Don't move!

697
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,460
Don't move!

698
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:22,760
Are you the drug cook?

699
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:24,610
Take him away.

700
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,720
Let's go. Hurry!

701
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,350
Slow down.

702
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,790
The factory has been busted?

703
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:35,960
What happened?

704
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,340
Xu was captured

705
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,070
and he gave up the location?

706
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:47,970
Okay, I get it.

707
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,770
What is it, Mu Qing?

708
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:16,180
Mr. Glasses.

709
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,890
Our clients in the dark web

710
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,560
are asking us to ship the goods.

711
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,970
You have to think.

712
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,950
[Don't we still have some left?]

713
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,720
We got a large order.

714
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:27,620
The stash was already sent away.

715
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:29,110
[If there were any left,]

716
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,830
[why would I look for you so urgently?]

717
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,590
[Mr. Glasses.]

718
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,480
[You are in charge of production.]

719
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:36,550
[I'm the one contacting the clients.]

720
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,090
[I'm the one being pressured.]

721
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:40,240
You have to be considerate of me.

722
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,050
You asked for a lot last time

723
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,940
and I did overtime just for you.

724
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,430
Wasn't that considerate enough?

725
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:48,510
Tell them

726
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,140
to wait a few more days.

727
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,640
A few days?

728
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:53,880
One week.

729
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,960
Are you kidding me, Mr. Glasses?

730
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,590
Wait for a week?

731
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,170
We can't wait another day.

732
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,340
[These clients are all retail buyers.]

733
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:04,490
If you cut off the supply,

734
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:05,890
they'll find someone else.

735
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,300
They won't wait for a week.

736
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,390
Mr. Glasses.

737
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,350
Are you in some kind of trouble?

738
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,710
If you're having problems,

739
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:27,940
you can tell me.

740
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,700
I'll shoulder the burden with you.

741
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:31,810
[You said it before.]

742
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,180
[We're working under the same roof.]

743
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:36,160
[I can't sit back and watch.]

744
00:38:38,010 --> 00:38:39,160
I also said

745
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:40,920
that you do your job

746
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,100
and I'll do mine.

747
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,200
Do you understand?

748
00:38:45,270 --> 00:38:46,500
It's none of my business, right?

749
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:47,740
Fine.

750
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,100
Then do it yourself.

751
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,080
If Mr. Ou finds out what happened,

752
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,180
don't come to me.

753
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,000
[Wait.]

754
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,600
Tackle him from the base.

755
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:11,100
The base is gone now.

756
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,420
What are you going to do next?

757
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:13,520
Replace it.

758
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:18,270
Mr. Ou and Glasses wouldn't tell us

759
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,900
where Spectre's man is.

760
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:22,060
We can't find any useful information.

761
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,120
That's why

762
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:26,020
I think we should plant someone

763
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,380
by Glasses's side at all times.

764
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,670
We've thought about it.

765
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,390
Glasses is well-connected and competent.

766
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:35,780
He can find materials and a new factory

767
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,410
in no time.

768
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,800
But finding a cook who can sustain him,

769
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:43,000
he can't do that in a short time.

770
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:44,890
You mean

771
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:46,830
you want me to plant someone in?

772
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:48,980
Yes.

773
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,700
It's not just to watch his every move

774
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:52,770
and find Spectre's man,

775
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,570
we have to find his secret.

776
00:39:58,970 --> 00:39:59,850
Okay.

777
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,480
I'll set it up.

778
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:09,970
Did you miss anything?

779
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,130
No.

780
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,680
That's all there is to making meth.

781
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,050
Think carefully.

782
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:19,250
Don't miss any details.

783
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,530
That's really all.

784
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,750
Right. Officers.

785
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,130
Why are you asking me this?

786
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,450
Why do you care?

787
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,770
It has nothing to do with you.

788
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,280
But let me tell you.

789
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,080
You make money from cooking meth.

790
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,360
You're rotten to the core.

791
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,180
You'll be punished by the law.

792
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:47,060
You're back.

793
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:48,950
Did you find out?

794
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,460
Except for a few tricks,

795
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,600
in general,

796
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:54,940
it's like what chemistry teachers say.

797
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,930
Captain Rong is inconsiderate.

798
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,880
He knows we don't have time.

799
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,300
But he told me to learn everything.

800
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:06,680
-How so?
-Those little tricks are the point.

801
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,200
Those methamphetamine makers

802
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:12,100
do it mostly in the same way.

803
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,080
But their tricks are not the same.

804
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,280
But these tricks
are what make them different.

805
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,780
You can tell if they're professionals

806
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:20,190
or some nerds

807
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,860
trying to make money in a lab.

808
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,520
