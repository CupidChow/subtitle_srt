[Episode 16]

3
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,300
The most important task at hand

4
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,890
is to rebuild our network.

5
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,710
I believe you have the ability and spirit.

6
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,650
Don't disappoint me.

7
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:48,670
I understand, sir.

8
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:50,259
Can you get it done

9
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:51,880
within two weeks?

10
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:53,690
Sir.

11
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:55,490
It will be done in a week.

12
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,570
That's good.

13
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,510
Come here. Let's have some tea.

14
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,780
Something unexpected came up.

15
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,490
Why did Ou Kexin

16
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,780
speak up for Mu Qing?

17
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,390
Did you not see

18
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,900
how Ou Kexin treated Mu Qing?

19
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,670
Next time,

20
00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:30,520
read the room.

21
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,130
But...

22
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,640
you did shake Mu Qing up.

23
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,870
I think

24
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,850
he'll know what to do.

25
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,370
[Mu Qing]

26
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,920
You're right.

27
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,210
That's not a guess.

28
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,550
My eyes have never misjudged anyone.

29
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,420
Hello.

30
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,580
This is all the information

31
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:06,900
on Mr. Dakun's properties.

32
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,100
A small part of it

33
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,290
was under Mr. Dakun's name.

34
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,790
The police have seized them.

35
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:13,060
Most of them

36
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,470
are under Mr. Dakun's dealers'.

37
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,440
They're fine.

38
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,540
You should take them.

39
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,550
Mu Qing.

40
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,700
You gave this to us.

41
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,150
What are you doing?

42
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,690
Mr. Dakun's territories

43
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,010
aren't supposed to be ours.

44
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,960
Mr. Congtou and Guanyin.

45
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,410
I'm sorry.

46
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,710
If you give us the territories,

47
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,300
how will you deliver your goods?

48
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,480
The police are already onto

49
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,190
the territories of Mr. Dakun's dealers.

50
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,090
We can't ship anything.

51
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,420
But these properties

52
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,610
still worth some money.

53
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,720
You can sell or rent them.

54
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,050
It's a lot of money.

55
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,770
But don't you have the task

56
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,790
of rearranging the sales network?

57
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,510
If you sell those territories,

58
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,530
you can avoid the police

59
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,850
while doing your job.

60
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,480
If you give them to us,

61
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,890
what are you going to do?

62
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,750
I'm still inexperienced in the group.

63
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,340
I don't have seniority.

64
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,010
Please accept them.

65
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:17,209
If I have a hard time in the future,

66
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,110
I'll also ask for your help.

67
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,680
Why don't I understand?

68
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,310
Dakun's businesses,

69
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,110
sales, title deeds, and so on.

70
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,610
All of them are given to us.

71
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:37,810
Has that brat always been so generous?

72
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,810
What are you doing?

73
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,670
Don't simply touch it.

74
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:50,700
Mr. Ou gave him one month.

75
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,380
But he gave us all his territories.

76
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:56,150
What on earth is he up to?

77
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,480
Does he have some kind of plan?

78
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,600
Guanyin.

79
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:03,680
I'm talking to you about the reason

80
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:05,790
he gave us all Dakun's businesses,

81
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,810
sales, and title deeds.

82
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,400
I didn't ask you whether that brat

83
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,420
will be dead or alive after a month.

84
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,960
This is why he's smart.

85
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,500
No.

86
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,220
What's going on?

87
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,150
Why do I feel like

88
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,450
you suddenly have respect for that kid?

89
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,310
Are you starting to admire him too?

90
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,280
Congtou.

91
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,130
That kid, Mu Qing,

92
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,900
is not an ordinary person.

93
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,190
How do I divide the properties?

94
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,000
They are all yours.

95
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,340
Okay.

96
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,460
They are all mine.

97
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,020
Okay, I gave them everything.

98
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,180
You've given it to them?

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,550
It breaks my heart.

100
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,040
All those lands and title deeds

101
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,720
must be worth a lot of money.

102
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,820
What?

103
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,310
You can't bear to part with them?

104
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,320
So what if that's true?

105
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,380
It's a done deal.

106
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,620
Forget it.

107
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:14,470
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

108
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,490
That's right.

109
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,770
You're a promising young man.

110
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,740
Of course.

111
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,330
Look at whom I hang out with every day.

112
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:30,490
How did Kexin and Mu Qing

113
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,510
become so close?

114
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,500
In our line of work,

115
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,440
we risk our lives every day.

116
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,070
I don't want anything

117
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,000
to happen between them.

118
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,520
Besides, this Mu Qing

119
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:46,630
is always cautious.

120
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,130
He always contains himself.

121
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,860
Why did he make his intention

122
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,659
towards Kexin clear today?

123
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,450
That is a bit strange.

124
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,630
What do you think?

125
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,750
You know how Kexin is.

126
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:01,640
She'll do whatever it takes

127
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:02,960
to do what she wants.

128
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,520
But Mu Qing was a bit strange today.

129
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:08,020
He actually agreed

130
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:10,480
to do as Kexin says.

131
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,900
Do you also think

132
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,670
that he was forced to do so

133
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,350
because today is a special day?

134
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,510
That's too much for a birthday present.

135
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:21,700
Yes.

136
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,710
Mu Qing is a smart guy.

137
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,950
But he didn't have to push himself

138
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,140
in an unfavorable direction.

139
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,570
I'm just worried

140
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,730
that Kexin might get hurt.

141
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,150
Compared to your business,

142
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,390
she's more precious to you.

143
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,210
What should we do?

144
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,150
Do you want someone

145
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:54,390
to keep an eye on him?

146
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:00,200
He's busy rebuilding the sales network.

147
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,310
If we keep an eye on him,

148
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:05,040
I'm afraid he will feel resentful.

149
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,410
But...

150
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,930
precautions are necessary.

151
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,780
I understand.

152
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,490
I'll take care of it.

153
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,750
Right.

154
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,120
Did you look into the cold storage?

155
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,580
I've checked.

156
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:27,260
Dakun abducted an undercover cop.

157
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,640
He said he needed a backup plan.

158
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,140
I'm asking you

159
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,340
if it had anything to do with Mu Qing.

160
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,380
There's nothing yet.

161
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,880
Is it purely a coincidence?

162
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,210
Forget it.

163
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,240
"Do not suspect the man you use."

164
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:45,390
Sometimes,

165
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,060
trust is very important.

166
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,490
Why didn't you go work out?

167
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,640
Are you slacking off today?

168
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,350
I already did it this morning, okay?

169
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:20,060
You're dressed so ostentatiously.

170
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,080
Where are you going?

171
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,460
Are you going on a date?

172
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,490
What do you mean by "date"?

173
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,080
I'm going to see Kexin for a while.

174
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,320
You're going to see Kexin?

175
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:32,510
What's wrong?

176
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,550
Do you really take

177
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:37,170
what Kexin said yesterday seriously?

178
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,980
Listen up, Mu Qing.

179
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,180
Kexin was just kidding with you.

180
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,290
Do you really think
she'll see you as her boyfriend?

181
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,830
Are you overthinking it?

182
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,250
You're the one overthinking it.

183
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:49,670
What "boyfriend"?

184
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:52,660
It's not a date, is it?

185
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:53,980
Of course not.

186
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,170
Okay.

187
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,190
Wait for me here.

188
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,780
I'll get changed and go with you.

189
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,790
You little...

190
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:16,770
Go.

191
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,090
Mu Qing, you're here.

192
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,320
Am I not a human?

193
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,350
What are you doing here?

194
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,630
He insisted on tagging along.

195
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:53,780
I came to see

196
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,960
whether I can be of help.

197
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:57,820
Why don't you

198
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:59,450
let him be your assistant's assistant?

199
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,780
Assistant's assistant?

200
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,080
Okay.

201
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:06,840
Do you know how to iron?

202
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:08,470
What's so hard about that?

203
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,620
Try it.

204
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,260
Iron it properly, will you?

205
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,520
Mu Qing, help me get the fabric.

206
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,300
Mr. Mu.

207
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,980
Why are you here?

208
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,430
Mr. Glasses sent Shao Nan

209
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,660
to take care of me

210
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,200
and to do some cleaning too.

211
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:36,680
Get back to work.

212
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,130
Yes.

213
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:44,200
Mr. Li.

214
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,290
It seems Glasses is watching you.

215
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,680
Maybe Mr. Glasses doesn't trust me.

216
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,180
Do you think

217
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:03,600
that you can reassure him?

218
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,890
I think

219
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,340
I can do that.

220
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,640
Is there anything else I can do?

221
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,370
Ironing clothes is so unmanly.

222
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:25,820
Too unmanly?

223
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,590
Fine, there's one that suits you.

224
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,400
Do you see these fabrics?

225
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,380
Help me move them to the third floor.

226
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,450
Then move them from the third floor

227
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:35,410
to the second floor.

228
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:37,610
Then move them to the third floor again.

229
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,710
Then move them back here.

230
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,660
That's very manly.

231
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,810
It's just...

232
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,820
Move it.

233
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,580
Okay.

234
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:48,700
Pick a big one.

235
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:51,250
Pick the manliest one.

236
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,150
Boss, come here!

237
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,110
What's wrong?

238
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:55,350
Look at this!

239
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,330
My goodness!

240
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:59,310
This is such an expensive fabric.

241
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,450
Li Ruosheng!

242
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,740
Look at what you've done.

243
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:04,010
Apologize to it.

244
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:07,930
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

245
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:09,560
I punish him

246
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,920
to clean all the windows today.

247
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,900
Watch him.
Don't let him leave until he's done.

248
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,450
What are you looking at? Do you hear me?

249
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,420
Yes.

250
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,390
That's good.

251
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,410
Qingqing, let's go.

252
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,910
Let's go for a walk.

253
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,200
Where are we going?

254
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,960
Let's get out of here.

255
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:25,970
You...

256
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,200
Are you...

257
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,010
Are you leaving just like that?

258
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,690
Wipe the windows properly.

259
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,880
I won't repeat myself.

260
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,200
Let's go.

261
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,670
Please comfort it for me.

262
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,730
I'll be right back.

263
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,550
Hurry up.

264
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,260
Li Ruosheng is so troublesome.

265
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,670
Isn't he always like that?

266
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:46,960
What a coincidence.

267
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,230
What are you doing here?

268
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,070
I'm shopping. Where are you two going?

269
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,790
It's none of your business.

270
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,330
Do I have to tell you about our date?

271
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,870
Don't be a third wheel. Go away.

272
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,670
He's my partner.

273
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,950
You hire him as an assistant.

274
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,620
Have you discussed this with me?

275
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,590
Hold on.

276
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,520
Who said he wanted to be

277
00:14:05,610 --> 00:14:07,200
my assistant's assistant?

278
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,740
Why are you arguing loudly

279
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,880
with the boss here?

280
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:10,850
Come here.

281
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:12,830
Let me ask you.

282
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,970
Tell me, Qingqing.

283
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,560
Take a stand.

284
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,160
Ruosheng.

285
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,030
You should go back first.

286
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,160
Come on.

287
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:32,580
Bye.

288
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:33,550
I am...

289
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,140
What a cruel man!

290
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,030
It's for your own good!

291
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,540
Hey, Mu Qing!

292
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,380
-Let's go.
-Come on.

293
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,550
I just want to tell you two a story.

294
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,190
None of the girls I chase after

295
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:32,950
can run away...

296
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,500
Why did she push me?

297
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:39,510
Don't go.

298
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,010
I need to talk to you. Come with me.

299
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,020
What's there to talk about?

300
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,160
We can talk at home.

301
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,200
I just want to know your feelings.

302
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,790
What do you mean?

303
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,330
Ou Kexin has feelings for you.

304
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,300
That's for sure.

305
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,020
What are your feelings then?

306
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,040
Are you seriously interested in her?

307
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,210
You're so boring.

308
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,610
I know I haven't cared enough for you.

309
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,590
I neglected your feelings.

310
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:11,190
I swear that from today,

311
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,420
I'll be good to you.

312
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,490
You can sleep on my waterbed.

313
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,730
Feel free to use my platinum VIP card.

314
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,060
You can use my game account as you wish.

315
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,830
As long as you don't take Kexin seriously.

316
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:23,730
If you can't hold it in,

317
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,760
I'll set a date for you

318
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:29,750
with any women in my WeChat contacts.

319
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,940
Is that okay?

320
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,000
My goodness.

321
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:40,580
Everything I said is for your own good.

322
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,810
Think about it.

323
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,110
Thank you for reminding me.

324
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,310
That's not it.

325
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,940
I'm not reminding you.

326
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,750
Hey!

327
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,160
Since we lost him,

328
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:04,780
then we'll have to take the next step.

329
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,800
Tell everyone to get ready.

330
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,050
We'll act tonight.

331
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,540
Yes.

332
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,290
How is it?

333
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:46,000
I checked it out. Nobody is in there.

334
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,780
Install a few more. Go on.

335
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,750
Yes.

336
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:05,850
Mr. Glasses, they've gone upstairs.

337
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:34,360
Why are you here?

338
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,910
[I knew you'd be here alone at night.]

339
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,410
I don't want anyone to disturb us.

340
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,990
That's why I chose this hour

341
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,960
to come and see you.

342
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,010
Let's go upstairs.

343
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,170
Wiretap.

344
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,280
My gosh.

345
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,860
What took you so long?

346
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,050
I'm so tired today.

347
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,940
Why don't we take a shower first?

348
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,850
You don't need to shower.
Let's talk first.

349
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,120
We'll shower afterward.

350
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,690
We must not rush. Let's take it slow.

351
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,530
Okay.

352
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,850
Let's shower together.

353
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:10,970
"Together"?

354
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,740
[That's more than I could wish for.]

355
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,000
-Mr. Glasses.
-Did you install one in the bathroom?

356
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:06,800
The bathroom is too humid.

357
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,910
I was afraid
our wiretapping device would get wet.

358
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,150
So we didn't install it.

359
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,170
I think your brain got wet.

360
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,240
You knew there was a problem.

361
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,350
Why didn't you prepare in advance?

362
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,980
I'm sorry, Mr. Glasses.

363
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,080
I...

364
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,480
I won't do it again.

365
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:21,940
Get lost.

366
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,080
Stop touching me.

367
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,500
There's no way I have a bug on me.

368
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,800
Let me introduce myself officially.

369
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,520
I'm Skylark,

370
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,940
an investigator of the Provincial
Public Security Bureau.

371
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,100
Hello, Mu Qing.

372
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,070
You're from the Provincial
Public Safety Bureau?

373
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,300
Do I not look like one?

374
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,260
That's some deep cover you went there.

375
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,540
I know you've already guessed

376
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,120
that I'm Skylark.

377
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:16,320
I just never had the opportunity

378
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,730
to verify our identities.

379
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,740
I'm sorry.

380
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,520
The Provincial Bureau is really something.

381
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:24,590
They made Mr. Ou's daughter

382
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,650
an undercover agent.

383
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:27,980
Mr. Ou and I

384
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,560
are not related by blood at all.

385
00:24:31,370 --> 00:24:32,780
I don't understand what you mean.

386
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,620
I'm just his adopted daughter.

387
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,030
He has no family.

388
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:38,060
My parents were shot dead by the police

389
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,990
while delivering drugs for him
in Southeast Asia.

390
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,000
Since then,

391
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,720
he has thought of me as his own daughter.

392
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,220
I was only a few months old,

393
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,270
so I knew nothing.

394
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,600
Before my godmother passed away,

395
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:49,010
she told me the truth.

396
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,910
Does he know that you know the truth?

397
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,100
He doesn't know.

398
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:54,730
Everyone around him also thinks

399
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,050
that I'm his real daughter.

400
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,500
Most importantly,

401
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,910
we had never met before.

402
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,070
He doesn't know me at all.

403
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,620
That's why it's easier for me

404
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,890
to carry out my work.

405
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:07,360
I believe we can work together.

406
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,990
There's something I haven't figured out.

407
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,320
How did you figure out

408
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,350
the passcode of the bomb on Zhao Nan?

409
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:23,200
Dakun is all brawn and no brains.

410
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,530
I bet he would overuse his password.

411
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,200
That's why I took a gamble.

412
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,590
How did you know Dakun's password?

413
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,200
The warehouse he gave me before

414
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,830
had the same passcode.

415
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,040
Didn't he swipe his card
when he bought something here?

416
00:25:40,090 --> 00:25:41,720
[I paid attention to the passcode.]

417
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:42,910
[It's the same.]

418
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,550
So I thought that must be it.

419
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:49,950
The way you told me the passcode

420
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,360
was really weird.

421
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:59,720
I believed you'd definitely figure it out.

422
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,370
I'm glad our mission was a success.

423
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:06,490
My current assignment

424
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,300
is to help you complete your mission.

425
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,840
So what are you going to do next?

426
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,920
Our top priority now

427
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,550
is eliminating Tieguanyin.

428
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,530
She's trying to win you over

429
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,980
and targeting me at once.

430
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:19,870
She's a big problem for us.

431
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,240
I don't know what to do yet.

432
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:23,740
When I've thought it through,

433
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,020
I'll inform you right away.

434
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:26,950
Okay.

435
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,360
I'll wait to hear from you.

436
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,380
Wait.

437
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,180
While I was dealing with Dakun,

438
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,420
I met a young man named Xiaowei.

439
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,490
He's not a bad guy.

440
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,960
If he continues on this path,

441
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,360
it will be a bit of a waste.

442
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,210
Is there any way

443
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,970
you can deal with it discreetly?

444
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:49,570
Well...

445
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,520
How is his body shape?

446
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,350
Kexin.

447
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,060
Kexin.

448
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:13,640
You're here too.

449
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,530
I bought supper.

450
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,940
Let's ask Kexin to join us.

451
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,210
Kexin.

452
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,480
You forgot your coat.

453
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,580
Here, put this on.

454
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,640
I'll do it.

455
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,630
You're here.

456
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,560
It smells so good.

457
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,620
I'm hungry.

458
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,860
Come upstairs and eat. Hurry up.

459
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,600
What does that mean?

460
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,140
Here, let me help you with that.

461
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:49,940
Hurry up.

462
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,780
Sir.

463
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,760
We underestimated

464
00:28:00,850 --> 00:28:02,390
Kexin's feelings towards Mu Qing.

465
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,850
Mu Qing's current behavior

466
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,450
really surprises me.

467
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:11,490
Although...

468
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,440
I admire Mu Qing,

469
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,610
but I definitely won't allow Kexin

470
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:20,510
to date anyone involved in our business.

471
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,290
Besides,

472
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:26,760
Mu Qing promised me.

473
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,930
He won't let this continue.

474
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:32,040
It shouldn't be.

475
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,130
Find out everything about Mu Qing.

476
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,040
If anything happens in the future,

477
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,530
I can explain to Kexin.

478
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,530
I can't let Kexin get hurt in any way.

479
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:45,680
Yes.

480
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,080
Hurry up.

481
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,540
How do you feel?

482
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,360
From now on,

483
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,650
it's official.

484
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:19,800
Won't you regret it?

485
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:25,250
Even if I know my dad would be mad,

486
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,630
my life

487
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,560
is up for me to decide.

488
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,090
What's wrong?

489
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,150
Smile a little.

490
00:30:45,230 --> 00:30:46,200
Smile.

491
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:47,560
You're not happy, are you?

492
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,630
What's there to smile about at this hour?

493
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,090
It's fun to be with me.

494
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,720
You smiled, didn't you?

495
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,130
You don't need a reason.

496
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,210
Smile. Come on.

497
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,360
I'm smiling.

498
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,100
Can you smile sincerely?

499
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,110
What a fake smile.

500
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:39,080
It's so hard to find this place.

501
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,750
What are you waiting for? Come here.

502
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,510
Come here.

503
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,710
Why are you looking at me like that?

504
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:02,930
I still don't get it.

505
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,170
You said you're Mr. Ou's daughter.

506
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:07,510
Why did you go undercover?

507
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,970
This is top secret.

508
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:11,690
Don't break the rules.

509
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:15,910
Besides,

510
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,710
even though I'm his daughter,

511
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,300
why can't I be a police officer?

512
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,030
We're both on the same side now.

513
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,360
And come to think of it,

514
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:25,590
let's solidify

515
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,170
our boyfriend-girlfriend relationship.

516
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,110
This way, even if we stay close,

517
00:32:29,330 --> 00:32:30,430
they won't be suspicious.

518
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:35,090
But your dad just warned me

519
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:37,070
not to get too close to you.

520
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:39,320
If I don't do as he says...

521
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,250
Don't worry. I'm here.

522
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,220
It's going to be okay.

523
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,630
My current mission

524
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:44,900
is to fully cooperate with you

525
00:32:44,990 --> 00:32:46,620
and protect you.

526
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,720
Help me settle Xiaowei down first.

527
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,280
Why do you want to help him so much?

528
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,430
You'll see.

529
00:32:57,710 --> 00:32:59,910
That kid is kindhearted.

530
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,330
Although he did some bad things,

531
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:04,130
with proper education,

532
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,320
there's still hope.

533
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,380
I understand.

534
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,090
We'll lead him to the right path.

535
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:11,700
Come on.

536
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,890
How did you find this ruin?

537
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,620
This place is a little ruined,

538
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,300
but Xiaowei is a wanted suspect now.

539
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,770
Dakun's men are looking for him.

540
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,570
It's good enough to have a place to stay.

541
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,860
Xiaowei.

542
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:48,880
Mr. Mu.

543
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,560
Mr. Mu.

544
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,530
Come in.

545
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,640
You must be Xiaowei.

546
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,740
Let me look at you.

547
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,840
What are you doing?

548
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:00,890
Not bad.

549
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:03,360
This brat has potential.

550
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,370
Does he fit the bill?

551
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,330
Who are you?

552
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:06,700
How dare you call me a brat?

553
00:34:07,230 --> 00:34:08,110
Xiaowei.

554
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,780
This is Mr. Ou's daughter,

555
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:10,750
Ms. Ou.

556
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,170
Ms. Ou?

557
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,750
I'm sorry.

558
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:16,550
Then...

559
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,310
is she your girlfriend?

560
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,260
Xiaowei.

561
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:22,850
That's an abrupt question.

562
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,030
She's just...

563
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,620
Of course I'm his girlfriend.

564
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,610
My girlfriend.

565
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:29,929
Nice to meet you.

566
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:31,560
Okay, let's get down to business.

567
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:32,530
Hurry up.

568
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:33,889
Xiaowei.

569
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,570
Come on, I'll take you to get a makeover.

570
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:37,889
A makeover?

571
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,300
You'd be surprised.

572
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:40,840
-Come on.
-Okay.

573
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:59,810
My goodness. What are you guys doing?

574
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,830
Thank you for the beer.

575
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,680
Tell me.

576
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,000
Do you want to be a model?

577
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:06,270
Me?

578
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,840
Don't be ridiculous.

579
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,200
Do you know

580
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:13,090
how many people are after me?

581
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,510
Don't you know
"the darkest place is under the light"?

582
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,930
You hid around the world.

583
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,030
Nobody would expect you

584
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,130
to walk down the runway

585
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,540
in front of everyone.

586
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,570
Thank you for your kindness.

587
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,370
But I think

588
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,010
I'll be like this my whole life.

589
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,250
Either I kill others

590
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,190
or they'll kill me.

591
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:38,790
Xiaowei.

592
00:35:39,230 --> 00:35:40,860
You can wash this outfit if it's dirty.

593
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,570
You can wipe your shoes if they're dirty.

594
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,940
But once your heart gets dirty,

595
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,260
you can't turn back.

596
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,940
You're still young

597
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,440
and you have a heart of gold.

598
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:52,470
You were only Mr. Dakun's hired goon.

599
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:55,420
You can still start over.

600
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,440
Don't you have us?

601
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,340
We're here.

602
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,860
All right. We're done with Xiaowei.

603
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:12,620
But I have a question.

604
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,690
The deadline you promised my dad

605
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,700
is almost due.

606
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,430
You gave Dakun's turfs

607
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,410
to Congtou and Tieguanyin.

608
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,520
How will you rebuild his sales network?

609
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,970
You're so quick
to get first-hand information.

610
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:30,400
Tell me.

611
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,920
It's top secret.

612
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,330
I can't break the rules.

613
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,420
You sure are a fast learner.

614
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,490
Of course. Who do you think I am?

615
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,160
Don't worry.

616
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,790
I already orchestrated everything.

617
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,900
I know how to explain to Mr. Ou.

618
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,290
Okay, let's go.

619
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,100
I'm tired. You drive.

620
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,180
At this point,

621
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,550
you still treat me like a driver.

622
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:01,510
Aren't you my boyfriend now?

623
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,070
Let's start.

624
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,450
Computer 1 is connected to the dark web.

625
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,510
Computer 2 is ready.

626
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,560
Computer 3 is ready.

627
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:36,530
Computer 4 is done.

628
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:56,420
Yes!

629
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:57,610
Computer 1 succeeded.

630
00:37:58,790 --> 00:37:59,670
Computer 4 succeeded.

631
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,480
Computer 2 also succeeded.

632
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,890
Computer 3, transaction completed.

633
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,250
Convert the crypto into US dollars now.

634
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:09,710
Move them all to account three.

635
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,810
Got it.

636
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,750
-Move out.
-Yes.

637
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,880
-It's all up to you now, Zheng Ke.
-Got it.

638
00:38:21,010 --> 00:38:22,640
The three of you, cooperate with Zheng Ke.

639
00:38:22,730 --> 00:38:23,920
We can't allow any loose ends.

640
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:24,890
Yes.

641
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:24,500
Be discreet.

642
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:36,520
Computer 2, received.

643
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:38,890
Computer 1, received.

644
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,870
Computer 3, received.

645
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,540
It's 17kg.

646
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,350
You mean 17kg, right?

647
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,670
Yes, it's 17kg!

648
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,030
It's 17kg.

649
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:48,660
It's 17kg in one night.

650
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,240
Mu Qing.

651
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,520
Your little steps

652
00:39:51,610 --> 00:39:53,150
are a big step for the group!

653
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,880
It's 17kg in one night.

654
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,420
All right.

655
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,220
I'll report to Mr. Ou.

656
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,460
After the crypto is sent into the account,

657
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,780
put them all up on the Internet.

658
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:04,190
You can sell it at a lower price.

659
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,200
Not at a lower price.

660
00:40:05,510 --> 00:40:06,390
Definitely not.

661
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,360
Only at a high price.

662
00:40:07,930 --> 00:40:09,250
We don't do unprofitable business.

663
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,620
Go and report it.

664
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:22,930
Hey, Mu Qing.

665
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,120
I saw it.

666
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:26,060
This is our shipment for the night.

667
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,330
[I'm surprised.]

668
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:28,960
You're better than Dakun.

669
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,460
You flatter me, sir.

670
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:32,310
[Why did I hear that]

671
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:34,150
[you gave Dakun's territories]

672
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:36,090
[to Congtou and Tieguanyin?]

673
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:38,070
Yes.

674
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:39,570
There's no point in keeping them.

675
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,150
You're so generous.

676
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,880
That's what you wanted, sir.

677
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:45,810
I only safeguarded them

678
00:40:46,430 --> 00:40:47,570
for you temporarily.

679
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:48,810
Go ahead.

680
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,090
How can I help you?

681
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,340
As far as the volume goes,

682
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:56,110
I'm worried that Tieguanyin

683
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,340
can't keep up.

684
00:40:57,830 --> 00:40:58,790
[Don't worry.]

685
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,550
[I'll ask her to cooperate.]

686
00:41:02,050 --> 00:41:03,060

♫ In the evening, by the serene beach ♫

694
00:42:00,790 --> 00:42:05,010
♫ From my camera,
you're looking at the shore ♫

♫ And let me kiss the edge of your nose ♫

702
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:52,620
♫ The wind blows past me as I zone out ♫

703
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:56,140
♫ When I turn around,
I lose you in the midst of a crowd ♫

704
00:42:56,320 --> 00:42:59,570
♫ You are a teardrop away ♫
