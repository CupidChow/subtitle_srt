No casualties. Mission accomplished.

That's good.

27

Now that the mission is over,

28

shouldn't we schedule our thing?

We're on a mission.

33
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,640
Be serious.

34
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,900
Don't forget it.

35
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,800
You should go and check the trunk.

36
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,610
There might be more evidence inside.

00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,750

Rong Yu's sacrifice

44

still haunts you and you can't let go.

45
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,370
But that accident was not your fault.

46
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,370
So you have to stop blaming yourself.

47
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:46,630
Don't forget. You're still on a mission.

48
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,600
From now on, don't let it happen again.

49
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:54,240
Otherwise, it will be too dangerous.

50

I got it.

51
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,390
This is the information on Scorpion
that you asked for.

52
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,960
Narcotics team has been watching Scorpion.

53

They were about to make a move.

54

That's why I don't care what you'll do.

57

61

00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,660
if Zhao Nan is dead or alive.

63
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,520
Can you do something about it?

64
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:27,860
Gather some useful information.

65
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,280
That way, we can rescue him in the future.

66
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,930
But make sure you're safe

67
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:34,940

68

Don't worry, Director Liu.

70

I'll get going then. Take care.

71

Okay.

72
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,760
Why didn't you ask me to jog with you?

73
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,520
I'm done jogging.

74
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,690
You got up so early for running today.

75

This is so unusual.

76

What do you mean?

77

I didn't sleep at all.

78
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,130
I was thinking about what you said.

79
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,030
So? Have you figured it out?

80
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:25,580
Do you really think

81
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:27,170
that we have no other way?

82
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,710
Sort of.

83
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,350
I can't help but think this is too risky.

84
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,549
How would you know if you don't do it?

85
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:35,390
How sure are you?

86
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:37,860
Why are you hesitating now?

87
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:39,490
I'm not.

88
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:40,980
This is our first blow.

89
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,700
We have to make it count.

90
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,410
We have to be sure.

as a strategist, I've told you everything.

I'm going to the shop. Are you coming?

I'm not going.

I'll run a little and get some sleep.

114

Okay then. Go ahead and run.

Can you even drive?

174
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,970
I asked one question.

175
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,210
♫ The storm won’t make me flinch ♫

176
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,240
You're the one who's talking.

177
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,960
"Can you even drive"?

178
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,500
♫ Because I’m worthy ♫

179
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:32,930
Watch me catch him.

180
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,210
Then do your best.

181
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:36,620
Hurry up.

182
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,770
♫ I’ll show you I’m capable ♫

183
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,150
♫ Of taking on the world ♫

184
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:47,710
♫ I’ll never hesitate ♫

185
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,120
♫ Don’t back down ♫

186
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,530
♫ The headwind ♫

187
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,810
♫ It will never get me ♫

188
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,180
♫ I am ♫

189
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:58,140
♫ A stubborn runner ♫

190
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,770
That way.

191
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,050
I see him.

192
00:11:58,230 --> 00:12:00,600
♫ I’ll take that shot ♫

193
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,530
Why are you stopping?

194
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,080
He's gone.

195
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,500
There's a situation.

196
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,090
We're running out of gas.

197
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,180
Earlier, you said you could catch him.

198
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,500
You just can't.

199
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,020
This isn't my fault.

200
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,300
Could I have predicted this

201
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,620
and filled up my tank for you?

202
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,380
Then call the police!

203
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,700
My money and credit cards

204
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,070
are all in my purse.

205
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,610
I'm talking to you.

206
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,580
Tell that to the police yourself.

207
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,360
-Officer.
-Hello. You were speeding

208
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,430
and ran a couple of red lights.

209
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,530
License, please.

210
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,890
What should I do? Where am I?

211
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,310
I can't even get a taxi.

212
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,180
Where are we going?

213
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,900
You're not walking, are you?

214
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,790
Then carry me on your back.

215
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,120
My legs hurt after chasing him.

216
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,040
Because of you,

217
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,800
my car was towed and I got fined.

218
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,470
Now, you're asking me to carry you?

219
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,440
Give me a break.

220
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,630
It's your fault.

221
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,120
What about my purse?

222
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,710
If you didn't let him escape,

223
00:14:10,790 --> 00:14:12,380
I would still have my purse.

224
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,310
Lady, you're very pretty.

225
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,490
But what is wrong with you?

226
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:20,080
You're a good-looking man too.

227
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,400
And what's wrong with you?

228
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,810
I'm starting to wonder now.

229
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,130
Are you with them?

230
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,800
I'm one of them?

231
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,050
You should be after the guy

232
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,150
who snatched your purse

233
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:31,780
instead of bothering me, okay?

234
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:32,920
I don't care.

235
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,110
Either you give me my purse

236
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,610
or...

237
00:14:37,370 --> 00:14:38,340
You can carry me.

238
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:41,550
What? Why should I carry you?

239
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:57,830
I'm thirsty.

240
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,930
Buy me a drink.

241
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,180
I'm a little hungry too.

242
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,990
I want chocolate.

243
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:07,160
Go buy it for me.

244
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,810
Why are you so slow?

245
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,310
I thought you wouldn't come back.

246
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:29,680
I'm a man of my word.

247
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:34,650
Here's your chocolate.

248
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,430
Thank you.

249
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,900
You're kidding.

250
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,220
You have such a fancy car.

251
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:44,250
Yet you only bought these?

252
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:46,450
It's a rental car.

253
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,710
I haven't had chocolate in a while.

254
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,870
Are you happy now?

255
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,240
It's okay.

256
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,820
About 30%.

257
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,800
Sure. Enjoy your meal.

258
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:02,950
I'll get going.

259
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:07,350
I don't have my purse or money.

260
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,110
Are you leaving me here?

261
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:10,600
I'm scared.

262
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,590
No money?

263
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,350
Here.

264
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:25,030
That's all? Only 200 yuan?

265
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,220
This is more than enough.

266
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,630
What do you mean?

267
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,920
Sir, did you call for a taxi?

268
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:31,940
Sir, hold on.

269
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,080
She did.

270
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,270
Sir.

271
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,900
I didn't. It wasn't me.

272
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,970
I've called a cab for you.

273
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,380
You can stay if you want.

274
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,490
You're leaving just like that?

275
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,520
What if I'm in danger again?

276
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,450
Don't worry.

277
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,830
The crime rate in China is much lower.

278
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:52,930
You're safe.

279
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,510
Hey, how can you do this?

280
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,030
Don't let me see you again.

281
00:16:58,430 --> 00:17:00,320
We'll never meet again.

282
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,580
Hey!

283
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,599
How could you?

284
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,099
Miss, are you coming?

285
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,520
You're so funny.

286
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,640
You let a woman bother you all day

287
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:21,839
and even paid 200 yuan for her ride.

288
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,250
You didn't even get her WeChat.

289
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,280
Mu Qing, you are a smart man.

290
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:28,130
Why didn't you ask
for something in return?

291
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,490
Be honest,

292
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,510
was the woman kind of ugly?

293
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,930
Are you done yet?

294
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,960
She's not as pretty as you.

295
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,570
What's going on with Scorpion?

296
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,650
Let's not talk about Scorpion.

297
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,490
Let me ask you something.

298
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:48,150
We've known each other for so long.

299
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:51,050
I've never seen you with a woman.

300
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,380
Do you have someone in mind?

301
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,030
It's fine.

302
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,410
It's okay if you do.

303
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,420
Tell me.

304
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,920
That way, I'll know

305
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,940
if there's anything I can do for you.

306
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,480
Mind your own business.

307
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:07,420
-What are you doing?
-What is this anyway?

308
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:08,740
I just put this on.

309
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,150
It's 300 yuan each.

310
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,180
-What's wrong with you?
-Can you be serious, Li Ruosheng?

311
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:16,350
If we want to get promoted in the group,

312
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,980
Scorpion is our only chance.

313
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,690
Why aren't you nervous?

314
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:21,360
How can I not be nervous?

315
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,520
Stop it.

316
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,560
What's wrong with you?

317
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,270
Aren't you usually calm?

318
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,860
Why are you so anxious?

319
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,840
I asked my men to follow Scorpion.

320
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,730
Scorpion is very experienced.

321
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,400
He's always on the move.

322
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,200
He's not easy to find.

323
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,280
Besides, why do we have to catch him?

324
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,690
We're not the police.

325
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,410
When Scorpion shows up,

326
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,460
we'll end him.

327
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,400
That's it. It's not that complicated.

328
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,800
Do as I say.

329
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,780
I have my reasons.

330
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,580
Okay, we'll do as you say.

331
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:55,950
You have reasons. Of course.

332
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,360
You're always right, okay?

333
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,570
What a waste.

334
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,330
Where are you going?

335
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,800
I'm going to unwind.

336
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,520
I'll go out for a drink by myself.

337
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:08,750
Is that allowed?

338
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,790
Who is this?

339
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:24,460
Godfather.

340
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,310
Just say the word.

341
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,430
Okay.

342
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:35,280
Okay, no problem.

343
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:38,010
Bye, Godfather.

344
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,490
Mr. Ou called you?

345
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,290
That's terrifying.

346
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:50,550
He had never called me before this.

347
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,730
He wants us at Shiku Bridge Police Station

348
00:19:55,390 --> 00:19:56,450
to pick up someone.

349
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,600
Who is it?

350
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,520
-Who is it?
-Go get changed.

351
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,530
Let's talk on the way.

352
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:10,170
He just asked us to pick up a woman.

353
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,370
Mr. Glasses will take her
tomorrow at noon.

354
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:14,530
What woman?

355
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,540
Don't freeze when you see a pretty woman.

356
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:34,200
What's her relationship with Mr. Ou?

357
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:35,820
I have no idea.

358
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,410
But she's young and beautiful.

359
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,170
According to my analysis,

360
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:41,410
she is my godmother.

361
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,600
Don't assume things.

362
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:43,660
You should ask clearly.

363
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,110
Do you want to ask him?

364
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,400
We do whatever Godfather asks.

365
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,670
We don't question him.

366
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,440
Are you coming or not?

367
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,460
Fine.

368
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,370
Waiting at a police station

369
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,490
is really scary.

370
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,640
Why can't we go somewhere else?

371
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:28,090
Why the police station?

372
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,290
I'm still mentally weak.

373
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,490
Is that her?

374
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,690
I think so. I'll go and check.

375
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,100
Hi, I'm Li Ruosheng.

376
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,780
Mr. Ou asked us to fetch you.

377
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:16,890
You're finally here.

378
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:19,480
Come and say hi to my godmother.

379
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:21,860
Who's your godmother?

380
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,240
Do I look old enough to be a mom?

381
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,950
Mr. Ou is my godfather.

382
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,160
When did he get a godson?

383
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,480
Come on.

384
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,690
It's you.

385
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,500
Now, you're picking me up.

386
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,700
Where were you these past few hours?

387
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,540
Do you two know each other?

388
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,130
She's the woman I told you about.

389
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,900
The chick who bothered you?

390
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,930
Well, she's pretty.

391
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,290
What chick?

392
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,830
Besides, who bothered him?

393
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,340
He let the thief got away.

394
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,020
I lost my purse and all my money.

395
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,080
I was locked up in there

396
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,360
with a few drunks for so long.

397
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,470
I stink now.

398
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,920
Look at you.

399
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:13,030
You left me in a taxi and walked away.

400
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:14,750
That's your fault.

401
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,510
That's not how you treat a lady.

402
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:17,520
Right?

403
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,200
You two work together, right?

404
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,740
You must be a jerk too.

405
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,750
I...

406
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,850
Let me tell you something.

407
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:26,670
I would rather walk to my dad's house

408
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,030
than getting in your car.

409
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,490
I almost forgot.

410
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,050
Here's your 200 yuan.

411
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,330
And these.

412
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,790
Take it back.

413
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,030
This one is for you.

414
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,210
Thank you.

415
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,780
What did she just say?

416
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,760
She's not getting in our car.

417
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,390
Not that one.

418
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,410
She said she'd rather walk

419
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,470
to her dad's...

420
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:02,930
Dad? Is she Godfather's daughter?

421
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,490
Bring the car around.

422
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:07,540
I'll go after her.

423
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,080
I'm telling you, Mu Qing.

424
00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,020
You're in big trouble.

425
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,680
This is good chocolate.

426
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,150
-Ms. Ou.
-Let go.

427
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,090
Come back with me.

428
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,140
It's our job.

429
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,080
Who are you? Do I know you?

430
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,490
Why should I go with you?

431
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,250
About what happened earlier,

432
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,010
it was my fault, so I'm sorry.

433
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,060
I'm telling you.

434
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,300
I'm a woman.

435
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,410
If you don't let go, I'll make a scene.

436
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,910
Help! Pervert!

437
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:46,970
He's a pervert.

438
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:48,820
Don't do that.

439
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:50,750
Stop it.

440
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:53,170
All right.

441
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,060
Are you afraid now?

442
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,850
What should I be afraid of?

443
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,580
I just think you shouldn't be
screaming like that

444
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:04,080
since you're Mr. Ou's daughter.

445
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,110
It's embarrassing.

446
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,610
If you think that

447
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:10,200
my apology isn't sincere enough,

448
00:25:10,510 --> 00:25:12,270
I'd like to formally apologize again.

449
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:13,670
I'm sorry.

450
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,040
If an apology is enough,

451
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,580
what's the point of the law?

452
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,120
You have no idea.

453
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,090
There was a man.

454
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,850
He threw up.

455
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,400
I almost got it all over me.

456
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:24,810
Poor me.

457
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,350
I'm finally back from abroad.

458
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,150
But I can't even go home.

459
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,690
Then my dad sent

460
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:32,110
two bad guys here to pick me up.

461
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,390
Why am I so unfortunate?

462
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,950
Ms. Ou, don't be sad.

463
00:25:45,350 --> 00:25:46,320
How about this?

464
00:25:47,110 --> 00:25:49,310
You can scold me or hit me.

465
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:52,130
Take it out on me.

466
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:53,760
Do whatever you want.

467
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,430
Okay, come on.

468
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,740
You're so silly.

469
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,290
When you see a woman cry,

470
00:26:09,550 --> 00:26:12,060
shouldn't you offer her your shoulder?

471
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,350
My shoulder?

472
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,740
That's not okay.

473
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,290
Why not?

474
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,310
Are you wronged?

475
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,340
Am I not pretty enough?

476
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,900
Or am I too stinky?

477
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,280
That's not what I meant.

478
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,730
That's not what you meant?

479
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,530
I got it.

480
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,470
You think your shoulders are too precious.

481
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,620
I just don't want

482
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,810
to take advantage of you.

483
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,190
Show me how precious your shoulders are.

484
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,510
Fine. I can tell.

485
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,490
You're straight as an arrow.

486
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,850
You're single, aren't you?

487
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:01,030
But I like you.

488
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,150
Thank you.

489
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,200
Godson, you're here.

490
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,790
Ms. Ou, please, I...

491
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,190
It was a misunderstanding.

492
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:12,690
Please get in the car.

493
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,140
I can get in.

494
00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:15,680
Didn't you want to apologize?

495
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:18,450
You should buy me a meal.

496
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:23,030
A meal is fine.

497
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,230
I look forward to your performance.

498
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,930
Godson, come on.

499
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,910
-Open the door for me.
-Ms. Ou, please.

500
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,090
It was my fault.

501
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,430
I can't move because of my seat belt.

502
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,410
Hurry and open the door for Ms. Ou.

503
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,340
All right, come on.

504
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,620
Please.

505
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,090
It's fine. Let's go eat.

506
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:51,190
Let's go.

507
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,930
Free meal!

508
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:06,980
Is this what you call a big meal?

509
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,660
You have no idea.

510
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:09,890
When I was abroad,

511
00:28:10,060 --> 00:28:11,690
all I wanted to eat

512
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,940
were tofu brain and Youtiao for breakfast,

513
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,390
Chongqing hot pot for lunch,

514
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,100
and seafood and barbecue for dinner.

515
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,560
This is life.

516
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:19,610
Yes.

517
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,680
You chose a good restaurant. Nice.

518
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,560
No. I don't drink sweet drinks.

519
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,290
Excuse me.

520
00:28:29,470 --> 00:28:31,670
Do you have drinks that aren't sweet?

521
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,380
No, go buy it yourself.

522
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:36,550
I'll go buy some for her over there.

523
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,090
I'll find a supermarket.

524
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,100
You guys dig in.

525
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,820
You said you don't drink sweet drinks.

526
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,000
I changed my mind.

527
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,500
Besides,

528
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,230
I'm just buying time to be alone with you.

529
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,740
Why would you want that?

530
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,750
My goodness.

531
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,330
Introduce yourself to me.

532
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,080
Okay.

533
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:05,990
My name is Mu Qing.

534
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,750
What else do you want to know?

535
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,850
I'm Ou Kexin. Nice to meet you.

536
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,490
People who return from overseas
are totally different.

537
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:20,950
I'm flattered.

538
00:29:24,470 --> 00:29:26,010
You lived abroad for years, right?

539
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,940
Over a decade.

540
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,480
You've been there that long?

541
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,650
But you're speaking Mandarin.

542
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:34,630
I speak Mandarin with my mom.

543
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:37,400
Besides, there are Chinese people
in France too, okay?

544
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,600
And you hadn't been back before?

545
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:41,850
Why are you asking that?

546
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,650
I'm just asking.

547
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,330
Tell me about yourself.

548
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:48,970
You guys work for my dad.

549
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:53,420
You guys have nice cars.

550
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,350
Are you higher-ups?

551
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,220
Li Ruosheng kind of is, but I'm not.

552
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,940
What do you mean "kind of"?

553
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,920
He's your dad's godson.

554
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:04,420
I'm just a worker.

555
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,570
You're bold enough.

556
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,420
You let your boss run errands for you?

557
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,610
Our relationship

558
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,020
is complicated.

559
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:16,650
It's not what it looks like.

560
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,110
-Complicated?
-Ms. Ou, here.

561
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,650
I didn't know

562
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,240
if you like cold or hot drinks.

563
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,040
So I bought both for you.

564
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,720
There's also mineral water.

565
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,180
Drink whatever you want.

566
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,330
That's so sweet.

567
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,420
Li Ruosheng.

568
00:30:35,170 --> 00:30:36,140
Here.

569
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,650
-You know me so well.
-You talk too much.

570
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,420
You like soy milk?

571
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,950
-What's wrong?
-You know that he likes soy milk?

572
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,500
We're closer than that.

573
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:50,040
His favorite kind of milk,

574
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:51,540
the scars on his body,

575
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:52,680
and even his moles.

576
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:53,870
I know everything.

577
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,110
Do you think

578
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,870
she will go to my godfather

579
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,330
and tell on us?

580
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:20,010
We took her out

581
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,240
and bought her a meal.

582
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:23,130
I don't think she would.

583
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,870
You offended her, buddy.

584
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,280
She's like a princess.

585
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:29,950
She had never been to a police station.

586
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,190
From my experience, I can tell you

587
00:31:32,630 --> 00:31:34,350
that good-looking women

588
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,370
are petty-minded and hold grudges.

589
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:42,890
How well do you know her?

590
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,470
How would I know her?

591
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,800
I knew my godfather has a daughter,

592
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,120
but I had never seen her before.

593
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:50,360
I also heard

594
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:53,310
that she had an accident three years ago.

595
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,680
That's all I know.

596
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,300
What accident?

597
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,590
How would I know?

598
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,970
Don't worry about it.

599
00:32:01,060 --> 00:32:03,120
She won't be our responsibility
after tomorrow.

600
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,580
See you never.

601
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:10,560
But I'm afraid that I'll miss her.

602
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,940
After all, she's pretty.

603
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:16,320
What are you thinking?

604
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,130
What's wrong?

605
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:53,680
You made your bed,

606
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,020
now lie in it.

607
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,740
Yes.

608
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:05,160
Do you see that?

609
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,630
Last night, she asked me

610
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:09,210
to lend her my card.

611
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,790
So I lent it to her.

612
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,030
Guess how much she spent.

613
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,140
How much?

614
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,820
Five hundred?

615
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,730
Five thousand?

616
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:22,810
Fifty thousand?

617
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:24,830
Half a million.

618
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,910
I'm telling you.

619
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:29,930
This is your own doing.

620
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:32,710
If you don't stop her, we'll be broke.

621
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,700
What are you two mumbling about?

622
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,280
Come here and look at this for me.

623
00:33:40,630 --> 00:33:41,640
Come on.

624
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,930
Take a look. Isn't this nice?

625
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,170
Will it suit my dad? Will he like it?

626
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:47,800
You like this?

627
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:51,670
Ms. Ou.

628
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,870
A car will pick you up later.

629
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:56,200
If you like this, I'll buy it for you.

630
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,180
I'll send it to you afterward, okay?

631
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,060
I see.

632
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,780
You two are pushing me away.

633
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,070
Absolutely not, Ms. Ou.

634
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,040
The thing is,

635
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,290
the two of us have limited funds.

636
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:13,929
If we don't have any money,

637
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,780
how can we take you out again?

638
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:16,750
Am I Right?

639
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,679
Limited funds?

640
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:21,239
That's too bad.

641
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:24,050
I was just thinking

642
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,520
that you two were so nice to me,

643
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:28,010
so I wanted to put in a good word

644
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,380
for you both in front of my dad.

645
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,060
Maybe he would be nice to you too.

646
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:35,710
But if you have no money, forget it.

647
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,310
Although we don't have much money,

648
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:41,120
the two of us aren't petty.

649
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,420
Ms. Ou, whatever you like,

650
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,310
just put it in the cart.

651
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,810
I'll be paying for everything.

652
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,260
That's it, right? No big deal.

653
00:34:49,659 --> 00:34:50,710
That's more like it.

654
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,340
But...

655
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:54,719
there's this new purse from Paris.

656
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,010
I searched for it for a long time.

657
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,460
I just can't find it.

658
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:00,790
That's strange.

659
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,110
It's okay.

660
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,350
I know some people.

661
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:05,940
I...

662
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,910
My phone is inside.

663
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,360
I'll give him a call now.

664
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,530
Great.

665
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,170
Check this out.

666
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:22,000
And this one too.

667
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:26,350
Ruosheng was right.

668
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,730
You do hold grudges.

669
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,590
Don't think so poorly of me.

670
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:37,750
I'm paying you back.

671
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:39,690
If it weren't for you,

672
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:41,670
I would still be on the streets.

673
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,050
So...

674
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:48,130
You spent 500,000 yuan to pay me back?

675
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,210
I'm a grateful person.

676
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,190
And this is just the beginning.

677
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,910
You don't know.

678
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,580
If you take good care of me,

679
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,870
my dad will give you more.

680
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,960
Li Ruosheng told me

681
00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,980
that you've never met my dad.

682
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,450
And recently,

683
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:09,520
you two have been wanting to meet him.

684
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,320
Ruosheng told you that?

685
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,140
It doesn't matter.

686
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,680
What matters is that I can help you.

687
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:19,420
It's true.

688
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:21,350
If you take good care of me,

689
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,020
I can help you get

690
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,400
whatever you want.

691
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,930
Ms. Ou, you really...

692
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,090
Go on.

693
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,660
Who is it?

694
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,480
Is Ms. Ou here?

695
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,330
Mr. Glasses sent me here to get her.

696
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,150
My godson, you're good.

697
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:11,110
You're welcome.

698
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,190
Can't you open the door?
You're so passive.

699
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,160
What did I teach you?

700
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,190
I'm not like you.
You always think about girls.

701
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,900
-My goodness.
-What are you two doing?

702
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,220
Aren't you coming?

703
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,450
Godfather has rules.

704
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,210
I'll see him only if he asks for me.

705
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,600
Forget it.

706
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:28,890
Take care, Ms. Ou.

707
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:41,430
I'm telling you.

708
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,410
If she tells on us, we're finished.

709
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:45,480
No.

710
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,930
It has nothing to do with me.

711
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,600
You got the order to pick her up.

712
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,670
You're the one who offended her.

713
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,210
It wasn't me, right?

714
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,440
How did I offend her?

715
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,640
What do you think? You did offend her.

716
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,090
You left her alone on the street.

717
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,100
I didn't offend her.

718
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,340
Keep telling yourself that.

719
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,660
That wasn't offending.

720
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,670
How was it not?

721
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,720
I didn't even...

722
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,040
Get in.

723
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,760
After much consideration,

724
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,280
I shouldn't leave my saviors behind.

725
00:38:35,550 --> 00:38:37,260
So I went back for you.

726
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:38,710
I'm so nice, aren't I?

727
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,570
No, but you...

728
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,700
Don't worry. My dad won't scold me.

729
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,460
I'm not worried about that.

730
00:38:46,550 --> 00:38:48,130
I'm worried your dad will scold me.

731
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,360
Godfather has his rules.

732
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,390
He won't let us meet him like this.

733
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,490
Don't worry.

734
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:53,980
Even if he won't meet you,

735
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,360
I have a way to make him meet you both.

736
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,710
Aren't I a woman of my word?

737
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,320
What did you say behind my back?

738
00:39:05,950 --> 00:39:08,900
That you always ask questions

739
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:10,440
that shouldn't be asked.

740
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,900
When have I ever done that?

741
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:18,620
Shao Nan, you heard everything.

742
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,250
Ms. Ou told us to come.

743
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,750
We didn't ask to come.

744
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:24,170
Don't worry, I'm here.

745
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,370
[Stop]

746
00:39:56,550 --> 00:39:59,140
What business does my dad do with you?

747
00:40:00,990 --> 00:40:01,960
You're his daughter.

748
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:03,020
You don't even know that?

749
00:40:04,470 --> 00:40:05,350
All these years,

750
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,060
he just wired me money regularly.

751
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,230
I couldn't even contact him.

752
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,000
Speaking of which,

753
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,590
I haven't seen him in years.

754
00:40:14,850 --> 00:40:16,390
I'm a little nervous.

755
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:18,770
Why are you so nervous?

756
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,260
Everything will be fine.

757
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,420
You're right.

758
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,090
What are you doing?

759
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:33,020
I'm meeting my godfather.

760
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,740
I have to look good.

761
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:36,590
Don't ruin my hair.

762
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:46,790
Perfect.

763
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,910
Mr. Glasses.

764
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:12,140
It has been so long.

765
00:41:12,530 --> 00:41:13,680
Welcome back.

766
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:14,950
Like this.

767
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,860
It has been a while.

768
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:20,150
You've changed
after coming back from France.

769
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,510
Of course.

770
00:41:22,430 --> 00:41:23,450
Let me look at you.

771
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:27,100
You're all grown up.

772
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:28,810
You're even more beautiful.

773
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,400
Stop it.

774
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:31,670
You really are.

775
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,060
Your dad is waiting for you
in his study upstairs.

776
00:41:35,150 --> 00:41:36,030
I'll take you there.

777
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:37,610
You two are done here.

778
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:38,890
Shao Nan will take you back.

779
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,520
Hold on.

780
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,140
They are my saviors.

781
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,110
I brought them here.

782
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,800
Shutting them out like this is too rude.

783
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,160
Let them work.

784
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:48,350
They're not busy.

785
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,760
Maybe we should head back.

786
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,900
Stop talking. Let's go.

787
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:57,850
