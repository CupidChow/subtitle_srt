[Episode 3]

3
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,690
Your dad is waiting for you
in his study upstairs.

4
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:36,840
I'll take you there.

5
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:38,380
You two are done here.

6
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,610
Shao Nan will take you back.

7
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,060
Hold on.

8
00:01:41,150 --> 00:01:42,820
They are my saviors.

9
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:43,880
I brought them here.

10
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:46,650
Shutting them out like this is too rude.

11
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,840
Let them work.

12
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,020
They're not busy.

13
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,610
Maybe we should head back.

14
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,620
Stop talking. Let's go.

15
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,630
Can't you walk?

16
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,640
-Let's go.
-Kexin.

17
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,860
Why don't you wait inside first?

18
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,840
I have something to tell them.

19
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,900
I'll have them meet you
in the lobby later.

20
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,920
Okay?

21
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,720
You're Mu Qing, right?

22
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:16,610
Mr. Glasses.

23
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,370
Who told you two to come here?

24
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,910
Hey, Mr. Glasses. What are you doing?

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,490
-Come on.
-I'm coming.

26
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,060
-Hurry up, Mr. Glasses.
-I'm coming.

27
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,010
That's Glasses, a very crafty man.

28
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,680
Watch your word when you talk to him.

29
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,490
I can tell.

30
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,000
Come on.

31
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,540
My gosh.

32
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,410
This is so grand.

33
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,490
This must be Godfather's chair.

34
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,370
Ruosheng.

35
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,350
Is this your first time here too?

36
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,930
It's mainly because there's no fixed place

37
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,420
where I meet up with Godfather.

38
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:09,730
Thank you.

39
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,620
Thank you.

40
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,089
Doesn't she need to breathe?

41
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:22,580
They must have their own rules here.

42
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:23,770
I'm sure.

43
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,050
Godfather owns such a big business.

44
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,080
He must be very cautious.

45
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:31,290
Is it hard for the Four Vajras

46
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,960
to meet Mr. Ou too?

47
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:35,250
He only keeps Mr. Glasses by his side.

48
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,580
It's hard for others to meet him too.

49
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,110
Your dad is waiting for you inside.

50
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:54,480
You should go inside.

51
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,210
Dad.

52
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:04,000
I missed you so much.

53
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,120
Mr. Glasses.

54
00:06:25,290 --> 00:06:26,220
Mr. Glasses.

55
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,870
Since you're here, let's have a chat.

56
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,040
Last night,

57
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,810
three more of our turfs were shut down.

58
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,409
If this continues,

59
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,480
the whole business will close down too.

60
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,810
Listen to what Mr. Glasses is saying.

61
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,880
With you around,

62
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,550
there's nothing that can't be solved.

63
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:58,470
You're still inexperienced
in kissing up to somebody.

64
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:05,200
I've heard about you long ago.

65
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,280
You're Ruosheng's advisor.

66
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,430
You helped Ruosheng

67
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,750
organize his business very well.

68
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:14,750
Mr. Glasses.

69
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,990
I only gave him some simple ideas.

70
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,970
It's Ruosheng who teaches me

71
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,200
a lot about the business.

72
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:22,530
But...

73
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,170
without the help of a few elders,

74
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,200
we wouldn't be where we are now, right?

75
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,690
-Yes.
-Save it.

76
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,670
From now on, learn more

77
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,260
about the business from Ruosheng.

78
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:33,750
Bootlicking will get you nowhere.

79
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,060
I'm telling you.

80
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,380
What you two did today

81
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,760
is against the rules.

82
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:43,740
Something like this

83
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,470
shouldn't have happened to both of you.

84
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,490
I'm sorry.

85
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,500
Why did you suddenly come back?

86
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,200
Because I missed you.

87
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:06,970
What reaction is that?

88
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,720
If it weren't for Mu Qing,

89
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,500
you might have not been able to see me.

90
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,320
Tell me what's going on.

91
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:33,720
Mr. Glasses.

92
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,789
Since we've sent Ms. Ou back,

93
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,289
we'll get going then.

94
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,559
Just like that?

95
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,289
Mr. Glasses.

96
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,530
I haven't seen Godfather for so long.

97
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,290
I was hoping I could have a meal with him.

98
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,540
He's busy today.

99
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:49,390
Let's have a meal next time.

100
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:53,830
After you finish your tea,

101
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,380
Shao Nan will take you home.

102
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,320
What's with that face?

103
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,910
Have you lost your mind?

104
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,400
Mr. Glasses had made it so clear.

105
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,460
Didn't you hear him?

106
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,000
Of course I did.

107
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,370
I only get to see my godfather
a few times in a year.

108
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,790
Since we're here,
I won't just walk away with nothing.

109
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:25,730
Have a seat.

110
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,140
My gosh.

111
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:29,820
How did you survive before you met me?

112
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:32,070
Didn't Mr. Glasses say?

113
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,780
We should have some tea before we go.

114
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,010
Just stay a little longer.

115
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,150
Dad.

116
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,950
Mu Qing is downstairs.

117
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,180
Do you want to meet him?

118
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,540
There's no need.

119
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:53,540
You're going back tomorrow.

120
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,010
I just got home.

121
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,770
Now, you're asking me to leave

122
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,270
without even discussing it with me.

123
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,730
Don't you care about my feelings at all?

124
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,010
Did I ask you to come back?

125
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:06,560
When you decided to come back,

126
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,920
did you discuss it with me first?

127
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,920
If I hadn't received the news in advance

128
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,280
and got someone to pick you up,

129
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,000
where do you think

130
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,240
you would be right now?

131
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:19,230
I haven't seen you for more than a decade.

132
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,400
Is this how you treat your daughter?

133
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,290
I'm doing this for you.

134
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,700
What about my mom?

135
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,200
You left us alone abroad.

136
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,430
Was it also for our own good?

137
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,400
She's dead.

138
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,200
You're alive.

139
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,700
My methods

140
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,290
are good for her and you.

141
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,230
-It's good for her...
-Glasses.

142
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,020
Sir.

143
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:43,650
Arrange a place for Kexin to stay.

144
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,900
Take her to the airport
first thing tomorrow.

145
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,000
Kexin.

146
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:57,640
Kexin.

147
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,530
Kexin.

148
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,590
Kexin, be a good girl.

149
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,350
Kexin, don't be angry.

150
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:04,330
Your dad must have difficulties, Kexin.

151
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,630
What difficulties can he have?

152
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,870
If it weren't for him three years ago,

153
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,850
that incident
wouldn't have happened to me.

154
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,700
Did he even ask about it?

155
00:11:14,050 --> 00:11:15,550
When my mom died,

156
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,440
I had people looking for him.

157
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,760
Did he even show up?

158
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,740
How can one be so cruel

159
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,930
that he doesn't even bother

160
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,510
about his daughter and wife?

161
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,920
Tell me.

162
00:11:25,010 --> 00:11:26,510
Let me hear about his difficulties.

163
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,490
Kexin, be good.

164
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,730
This isn't the place to fight. Okay?

165
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,410
You can't even explain

166
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,910
on his behalf, can you?

167
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:38,030
Okay, I understand now.

168
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,190
You're not my dad!

169
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:47,580
Don't ever come looking for me!

170
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,220
Even if I die out there,

171
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,410
it's none of your business!

172
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:53,790
Kexin.

173
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:56,030
Hold on.

174
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,640
These few days,

175
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,440
you're in charge of taking care of Kexin.

176
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:02,410
Take this.

177
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,730
The password is on it.

178
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,190
You must keep her safe. Understood?

179
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,320
-Don't worry, Mr. Glasses.
-Go.

180
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,310
Tell Godfather to not worry.

181
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,810
Don't prick yourself, sir.

182
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,310
I'll do it.

183
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,810
It's such a nice piece of ceramic.

184
00:13:06,650 --> 00:13:07,970
What a waste.

185
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,520
She has always been bad-tempered.

186
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:11,710
No one can change her.

187
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:24,990
Sir.

188
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,410
Why wouldn't you let Kexin stay?

189
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:31,070
We're capable of protecting her now.

190
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,100
Do you think

191
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,800
I want her to know what business we're in?

192
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:46,290
I sent her and her mom abroad back then

193
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:49,060
because we have too many enemies here.

194
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:53,900
Her mom knew a lot about what I do.

195
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:55,840
But she doesn't.

196
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,700
Her mom and I have a mutual understanding.

197
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,990
We hope she would never find out

198
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,260
what her dad does.

199
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,640
[That's why, sir,]

200
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:07,150
[she may be very capricious,]

201
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,130
[but it's understandable.]

202
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,620
[You weren't around]

203
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,030
[since she was little after all.]

204
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,040
[What's more,]

205
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,980
[she even went through that incident.]

206
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,520
Do you really think

207
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,870
I don't want to keep her by my side?

208
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,590
I dare not.

209
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,030
Take Kexin to Tieguanyin.

210
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,140
Ask her to take Kexin to shop around

211
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,200
and buy some clothes.

212
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,840
Women can talk to each other comfortably.

213
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,100
But...

214
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,040
I've already asked Li Ruosheng and Mu Qing

215
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,980
to take care of Kexin.

216
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,960
Why?

217
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,510
As you know,

218
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,540
they are quite skillful.

219
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,520
They protected her well this time.

220
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,670
I think they're the right people

221
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:31,180
to be her bodyguards.

222
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,810
You think?

223
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,990
Sir, please don't misunderstand.

224
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,410
This is what I think.

225
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,050
Dakun is playing hide-and-seek
with the police.

226
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,160
He's busy running the factories
and delivering goods.

227
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,390
Guanyin is busy managing

228
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,540
the factory as well.

229
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,640
She can't be distracted.

230
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,570
As for Congtou,

231
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,080
he's so busy working on the raw materials

232
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,500
that you don't even see him around.

233
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,260
So...

234
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,590
That's why I arranged
for Mu Qing and Ruosheng

235
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,440
to take care of Kexin.

236
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:04,090
If you think it's inappropriate...

237
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,760
Do as you say.

238
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,750
I've checked it out. There's one million.

239
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,400
This isn't money.

240
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:05,030
It's obviously a problem.

241
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,180
Do you dare to spend it?

242
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,410
He gave it to us.

243
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:09,079
Why should I be afraid to spend it?

244
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,220
But why do you think

245
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,420
Godfather let us look after Kexin?

246
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,180
What does he have in mind?

247
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,339
Do you really think it's your godfather

248
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,750
who wants us to take care of her?

249
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,130
If Godfather doesn't want to,

250
00:17:24,609 --> 00:17:26,060
I don't think Glasses dares to do so.

251
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,850
Mr. Glasses and Dakun

252
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:31,210
are on the same side after all.

253
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,630
They're capable of pushing Kexin to us.

254
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:34,910
Then they'll be capable

255
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,530
of snatching a few more of our turfs.

256
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:39,530
Right now, it's too late for us

257
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:41,950
to find the source of Scorpion's stock.

258
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,710
You're making it sound so complicated.

259
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:45,250
I don't understand. Say that again.

260
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,920
I'm done talking.

261
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,210
I'll leave Kexin to you. I'll go now.

262
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,490
You're shameless.

263
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,210
I'll kill you, you jerk!

264
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:01,750
What happened?

265
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,460
Do you know who I am? How dare you hit me?

266
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,430
He's a bully.

267
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:06,890
Ruosheng.

268
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,990
Stay out of it.

269
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,360
Let the lackeys handle this.

270
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:11,950
Ou Kexin.

271
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,890
-You're shameless.
-Let's go.

272
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,350
You're shameless!

273
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,160
Don't come here again.

274
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:20,530
Take him away.

275
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,030
What a jerk.

276
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,130
That's enough.

277
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,230
The next time I see him,

278
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,510
I'll beat him to death.

279
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,450
You won't get to see him anymore, okay?

280
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,420
Wait. Mu Qing, what's wrong with you?

281
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,660
I was bullied.

282
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,420
And you were just there doing nothing.

283
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,920
You already handled it yourself.

284
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:39,940
You don't need me.

285
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,090
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

286
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:44,420
I'm heartbroken. It hurts. I'm so angry.

287
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,880
Is it that serious?

288
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:46,890
It's okay now.

289
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:47,860
Mu Qing.

290
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,400
You drive. I drank just now.

291
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:53,000
I drank too. Just get a chauffeur.

292
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,680
I have something to take care of too.

293
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:57,980
What do you mean?

294
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,520
If you won't help me, then fine.

295
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,010
You don't even want to send me back?

296
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,770
I understand it now.

297
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,400
You saw my dad abandoned me.

298
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:06,560
Are you that snobbish?

299
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,540
It's not serious.

300
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,770
I'll send you. It's the same.

301
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,820
How is it the same?

302
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:12,190
You are Li Ruosheng.

303
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,300
His name is Mu Qing. He owes me.

304
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:16,410
I'm telling you.

305
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,300
From now on,

306
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,020
you'll go wherever I go.

307
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,560
If I want to eat, you'll buy me food.

308
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,630
If I want to sleep,
you have to tuck me in.

309
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,730
Do you understand?

310
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,970
Is he your bodyguard or your boyfriend?

311
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,420
It's none of your business.

312
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,180
Do you hear me?

313
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:32,910
Kexin.

314
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,630
I know you've had a bad day.

315
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,270
But don't use that reason to threaten me.

316
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,110
I work for your dad.

317
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,390
I'm not your bodyguard.

318
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,580
Fine.

319
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,940
If something happens to me,

320
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,040
don't regret it.

321
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,050
Don't go.

322
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,150
What are you doing?

323
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,510
What if she goes missing again?

324
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,920
Aren't you looking for trouble?

325
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:53,550
Don't worry. She won't be gone for long.

326
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:54,820
Didn't she already leave...

327
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,650
See?

328
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,110
All good now?

329
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,000
Well-played.

330
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,660
Drive.

331
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:16,160
How did you know she would come back?

332
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,890
Get a chauffeur.

333
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:20,210
I have to go now.

334
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:21,350
Where are you going?

335
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,300
I'm going on a date. Do you want to come?

336
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,400
Can I?

337
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,720
You wish.

338
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,350
Are we getting a chauffeur or not?

339
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,110
-It's almost dawn.
-I'm on it.

340
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,080
I'll call right away.

341
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,710
-Are we leaving or not?
-Get in the car.

342
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,760
I'll get a chauffeur now.

343
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,120
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

344
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,170
♫ Happy... ♫

345
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,840
-Hurry and blow the candles.
-No.

346
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:53,560
Director, you haven't finished singing.

347
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:54,660
It's just a formality.

348
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,460
Hurry up and blow the candle.

349
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,710
-I have to make a wish?
-Yes, make a wish.

350
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,700
The candles are out.

351
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:07,820
Director Liu.

352
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,620
I like your gift this time.

353
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,780
At least it's a gift for young men.

354
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,150
Director Liu.

355
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,740
I have something to tell you.

356
00:21:17,230 --> 00:21:19,560
I went to Mr. Ou's house today.

357
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,120
But it's a bit of a waste.

358
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,580
I didn't get to meet Mr. Ou.

359
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,570
Did Ou Zhenhai ask to see you?

360
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:28,890
No.

361
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,960
His daughter took us there.

362
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,900
-Here.
-His daughter?

363
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,540
Shouldn't his daughter be in France?

364
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,840
I don't understand either.

365
00:21:39,670 --> 00:21:41,170
His daughter came back recently.

366
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,380
Right. Can you look into it?

367
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:46,360
In here,

368
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,990
there's a picture of his daughter

369
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:49,530
and some information that I gathered.

370
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,420
I'll let you know soon.

371
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,090
Yuanwen.

372
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,510
You must be prepared.

373
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,250
Your time as an undercover agent

374
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:05,890
has to be extended.

375
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,770
-What do you mean, Director Liu?
-It's like this.

376
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,290
The Interpol National
Central Bureau of China

377
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:19,050
has detected a new drug.

378
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,250
It's called G3307.

379
00:22:21,690 --> 00:22:23,490
It's entering Yungang soon.

380
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:26,130
If we don't stop the supply of this drug

381
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,720
into this city,

382
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,300
the production speed

383
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,840
and purity of the drug

384
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,170
will rise drastically.

385
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:37,130
This will gravely damage society.

386
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,380
It's very likely that Ou Zhenhai

387
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,970
is the buyer of this new drug.

388
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,570
According to a reliable source,

389
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,810
the raw materials supplier of this drug

390
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,400
is someone called Spectre.

391
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:49,850
The Public Security Bureau

392
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:52,050
has issued an order to arrest Spectre.

393
00:22:52,450 --> 00:22:56,230
If we arrest Ou Zhenhai at this time,

394
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,960
they will definitely be alerted.

395
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,500
So...

396
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:01,950
We will call off the operation

397
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,150
of arresting Ou Zhenhai for now.

398
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,950
-Call off?
-Yes.

399
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,020
What about my mission?

400
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,630
You finally got close to Ou Zhenhai.

401
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,560
So the higher-ups want you

402
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,020
to protect yourself.

403
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,250
Wait for the right time.

404
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,790
Once the conditions are right,

405
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,590
work with us and we will wipe

406
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,700
this whole drug network out in one blow.

407
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:26,680
Today, I represent the upper management

408
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,660
to inform you of this official order.

409
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:30,860
Okay.

410
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,920
Come.

411
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,380
Happy birthday. Eat the cake.

412
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:40,980
What's wrong?

413
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,280
Mr. Liu.

414
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,120
I didn't expect

415
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:48,370
this undercover mission to last so long.

416
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,270
Mu Qing isn't easy to play.

417
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,770
He's a calm and steady character.

418
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,570
It's very depressing to be him.

419
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,630
I'm different.

420
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,080
I'm a very cheerful person.

421
00:23:57,830 --> 00:23:58,930
If this lasts any longer,

422
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,470
I'm afraid I can't hold it in.

423
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:02,930
You punk.

424
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:06,050
That's a problem you have to deal with.

425
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:08,740
How charming it is to act cool, right?

426
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,190
I can't help you with that.

427
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,550
I'm doing this for the mission.

428
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,570
One less word,

429
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,150
one less expression, or one less move.

430
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,170
-No one will know what I'm thinking.
-All right.

431
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,890
I can promise you one thing.

432
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,170
On this day next year,

433
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,190
I will not be singing you a birthday song

434
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,550
in a place like this.

435
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,280
Really, Director Liu?

436
00:24:26,210 --> 00:24:27,220
Okay.

437
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,760
Which one are you going to eat?

438
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,170
Director Liu.

439
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,710
In what kind of environment

440
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,820
will you sing me
a birthday song next year?

441
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,970
I bought this cake.

442
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:41,560
Is there too much cream for you?

443
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,230
In what kind of environment

444
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,210
will you sing me
a birthday song next year?

445
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,230
Happy birthday.

446
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,130
Director Liu.

447
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,640
Director Liu. Sir!

448
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:09,900
Get in.

449
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,240
It's late.

450
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,260
What do you want from me?

451
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,800
Kexin is back from France.

452
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:28,820
Do you know that?

453
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:30,710
It's such big news.

454
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,900
How could I not know?

455
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,160
Boss should step down soon

456
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,920
and enjoy his life with his family.

457
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,210
Every day counts.

458
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:42,240
People in our business

459
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:44,700
can't have both family and career.

460
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:48,310
Don't talk nonsense, Dakun.

461
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,850
Are you suggesting

462
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:51,780
that the boss should retire soon

463
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,460
and hand over his power?

464
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:55,700
I dare not say such things.

465
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,780
If we're talking about being ambitious,

466
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:01,290
Don't forget about those two brats,

467
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:02,960
Mu Qing and Li Ruosheng.

468
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:07,270
They've been eyeing me for a long time.

469
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,810
Every now and then,

470
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,610
they would snatch some of my sales.

471
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,120
They seem impatient to swallow me whole.

472
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,770
I called you out to tell you.

473
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,680
I've gotten rid of Mu Qing.

474
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:21,570
I asked him to be

475
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,070
Kexin's personal bodyguard.

476
00:26:23,150 --> 00:26:24,870
That should keep him busy for a while.

477
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:26,850
Good one.

478
00:26:27,330 --> 00:26:28,520
Without Mu Qing,

479
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,460
Li Ruosheng is just an empty shell.

480
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,480
All he does is act rashly.

481
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:33,890
He won't do us much trouble.

482
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,100
Yes.

483
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,960
This brat is very lucky.

484
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,470
He found himself an advisor.

485
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,950
Without Mu Qing's help,

486
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,710
he wouldn't have made so much progress

487
00:26:47,790 --> 00:26:49,070
in such a short period of time.

488
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,570
So what?

489
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,720
In the boss's eyes,

490
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,660
Mu Qing and Li Ruosheng

491
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,110
are just some immature brats

492
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,960
compared to the four of us.

493
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,190
He'll still need us

494
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,470
to deal with serious matters.

495
00:27:02,970 --> 00:27:04,250
Among the four of us,

496
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,270
you have the sharpest tongue.

497
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:07,680
Stop flattering me.

498
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,390
You're back just in time.

499
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,980
My gosh.

500
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:46,180
You two...

501
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,340
You're good.

502
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:49,790
I'll leave you two alone.

503
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,720
-I'm leaving.
-You misunderstood.

504
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,880
I have to explain myself.

505
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,700
Ten.

506
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:57,750
-Ten.
-None.

507
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,780
None. Fifteen! Drink!

508
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,860
Fifteen.

509
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:12,010
Black sesame, white sesame.

510
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,260
-White sesame.
-Black sesame.

511
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,810
Kelp o kelp.

512
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:22,570
Kelp o kelp.

513
00:28:22,650 --> 00:28:23,710
Drink up!

514
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:35,590
So I bathed her

515
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,820
and changed her clothes.

516
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,890
That's all.

517
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:41,350
You bathed her

518
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,110
and even changed her clothes?

519
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,170
I...

520
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:46,680
How would I dare to bathe her?

521
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:48,310
I looked up a caregiver online

522
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,810
and told her that I have an 80-year-old
that needs caretaking.

523
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,270
Then it's settled.

524
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:54,990
You're not lying?

525
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,010
Where's my phone?

526
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:57,150
I have it on my phone.

527
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,290
Why would I lie to you?

528
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,950
I'm telling you.

529
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:05,510
If you want a peaceful life,

530
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:07,270
don't ever touch her.

531
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,770
Thank you very much.

532
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,610
I want to live a long life.

533
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,070
But she's really quite pretty.

534
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,950
Tell me.

535
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:28,480
If she wasn't my godfather's daughter

536
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,410
and wasn't my godsister,

537
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,960
that would be great.

538
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:44,840
What did I just say?

539
00:29:45,590 --> 00:29:47,220
-Did you forget already?
-Just one touch.

540
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,470
I'm kidding. Do you have to do this?

541
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,980
How can you steal all my hard work?

542
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:02,880
How boring.

543
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,190
Don't touch me.

544
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:21,230
Don't kick me out.

545
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,440
Dad, please don't kick me out.

546
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,980
I want to go home.

547
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:32,980
Come on.

548
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,250
Go to sleep.

549
00:30:34,870 --> 00:30:36,010
That's enough.

550
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,920
My gosh.

551
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,130
The smell is still strong.

552
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,990
That's the smell of you dating someone.

553
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,370
Didn't you lock me out?

554
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,560
Why did you come to my room?

555
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:09,590
What are you looking for?

556
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,460
This room smells nice.

557
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,680
Mu Qing.

558
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,100
Come out.
I'm telling you, I'm a neat freak.

559
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:21,640
Don't you dare sleep on my bed.

560
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,060
Mu Qing.

561
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,470
I'm telling you.

562
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,830
You'd better not sleep in my bed.

563
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,250
I'm telling you. You're dead if you do.

564
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,510
How funny.

565
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,650
You have your own bed.

566
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,110
Why are you sleeping on my bed?

567
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,640
Ruosheng, have you seen my phone?

568
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,100
Why would I care for your phone?

569
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:52,880
Go back to your room and look for it.

570
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:54,380
Stop standing there, will you?

571
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,210
I'm glad you didn't sleep in my bed.

572
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,070
At least you know what's right.

573
00:32:13,690 --> 00:32:15,010
I've locked the door from inside.

574
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,730
You can't even come in with the passcode.

575
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,220
Let me warn you again.

576
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:20,070
You can't have my bed.

577
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,160
Stop joking around.

578
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,920
Do you know who's sleeping in my room now?

579
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,820
I don't know. Good night.

580
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:29,490
Hey!

581
00:34:30,350 --> 00:34:32,330
Rong Yu.

582
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:33,560
Rong Yu!

583
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:47,440
You're in good shape.

584
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,110
I thought you won't be able

585
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,250
to get up in the morning.

586
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,500
That's you. I'm not...

587
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,830
Is there anything interesting
you want to share with me?

588
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,340
I left the door unlocked
for you yesterday.

589
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,010
You didn't come back either.

590
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,160
After all,

591
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,530
you didn't want to come back.

592
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:09,610
We are two different people.

593
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,460
I might not be able to do

594
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:12,960
the things that you can do.

595
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:16,170
We're all men. Don't be so uptight.

596
00:36:16,610 --> 00:36:18,410
I'm rarely this generous.

597
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:20,000
I gave the chance to you.

598
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,980
Yet you don't appreciate it at all.

599
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,650
Can we not spend our energy

600
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,500
on such meaningless things?

601
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,960
How many of our businesses

602
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,720
have been snatched away by Dakun?

603
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,610
Mr. Ou didn't even say a thing.

604
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,460
I thought

605
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,190
that accidentally saving Ms. Ou

606
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,550
could be a breakthrough for us.

607
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,650
But now?

608
00:36:38,870 --> 00:36:40,280
We were already in his house.

609
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,080
Yet he wouldn't even see us.

610
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,490
Who can you blame for that?

611
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:45,160
You said you wanted to leave. Didn't you?

612
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,660
We would've been able to see him

613
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:48,070
if we had stayed a little longer.

614
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,960
That doesn't matter anymore.

615
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,120
You need to understand something.

616
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,450
No matter what we do or how we do it,

617
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,780
Mr. Ou doesn't even care.

618
00:36:56,870 --> 00:36:58,140
That's right.

619
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,770
Didn't he just give us a chance?

620
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:02,630
Let's take good care of Kexin.

621
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,450
Then we'll get to see Godfather every day.

622
00:37:07,430 --> 00:37:09,360
Take good care of her? How?

623
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,510
You do it.

624
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,590
Are you still drunk?

625
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,820
[Get back here right now!]

626
00:37:27,450 --> 00:37:28,550
See.

627
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,650
We haven't talked about Scorpion yet.

628
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,850
Mu Qing, explain to me.

629
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:41,790
Why am I dressed like this?

630
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,770
And why was I lying in your bed?

631
00:37:44,910 --> 00:37:47,990
Did you forget that you drank last night?

632
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:50,460
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Explain yourself.

633
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:54,810
I knew such a cliché would happen.

634
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,310
What do you mean?

635
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,840
Yesterday, you were not in a good mood.

636
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,000
Li Ruosheng drank with you all night.

637
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:06,170
He found out that you were a bad drunk.

638
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,850
So he sent you to my room.

639
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,830
He said I'm your bodyguard now.

640
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:12,850
So I should take responsibility.

641
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,220
That's how I ended up

642
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,710
being blamed for all this.

643
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,190
As for your clothes,

644
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,870
Li Ruosheng got you a caregiver

645
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,240
to change them for you.

646
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,840
Is that so?

647
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:28,250
Of course.

648
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:30,850
Ms. Ou.

649
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,520
Think about your identity.

650
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,720
You're Mr. Ou's only daughter.

651
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:37,140
Ruosheng and I work for Mr. Ou.

652
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,680
Who would dare to touch you?

653
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,330
That makes sense.

654
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,380
Ms. Ou.

655
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,560
I think you should be more careful.

656
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,320
A normal guy

657
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,080
will never be interested

658
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,710
in a woman who is dirty

659
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,130
and has a bad drinking habit.

660
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,330
Is that so?

661
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,270
Yes.

662
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:10,980
What are you doing?

663
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,340
Aren't these your clothes?

664
00:39:12,470 --> 00:39:13,620
You can have it back.

665
00:39:14,490 --> 00:39:15,640
Take your time.

666
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,830
Just give it to me later.

667
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,540
Wait.

668
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,170
Wait for me in the basement.

669
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,400
In half an hour,

670
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:23,380
let's go shopping to help me sober up.

671
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,770
Fine. Let's go shopping.

672
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:46,390
Shopping is fun and relaxing.

673
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,290
There's more over there.

674
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,690
Let's go there later.

675
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:52,110
Have some tea with me first. I'm thirsty.

676
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:54,090
I'm so exhausted from shopping.

677
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:03,030
Order a cup of tea for me.

678
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,580
Just tell the waiter to order it.

679
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,590
Why should I do it?

680
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,610
I want you to order it. Go.

681
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,740
Please.

682
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,530
Get me a smoothie instead.

683
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,750
I need to take this call.

684
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,540
You haven't ordered my drinks yet.

685
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,940
Hello? What is it?

686
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,300
[Where are you?]

687
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,850
I'm shopping with Ms. Ou.

688
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,860
What is it?

689
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,400
Shopping?

690
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,960
Ou Kexin is really
the bane of my existence.

691
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,760
Hurry and get rid of her.

692
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:48,830
If this continues, we're both doomed.

693
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,070
[Dakun is here
to steal our business again.]

694
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,700
He did it on purpose.

695
00:40:52,790 --> 00:40:54,150
[That's not all.]

696
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,750
He's blatantly stealing from us.

697
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,330
Don't panic yet.

698
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,980
We can't mess with Dakun and his men yet.

699
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,480
But we must get rid of Scorpion

700
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,620
as soon as possible.

701
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:05,590
Sure.

702
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,620
We'll get rid of him tonight.

703
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,730
Tonight? Are you sure?

704
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,270
I've asked someone to follow him.

705
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,590
Come back and discuss it.

706
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,170
Okay, see you later.

707
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,340
[Collect the laundry tonight.]

708
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:44,620
["Never Say Goodbye" playing]

♫ In the evening, by the serene beach ♫

710
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:05,650
♫ From my camera,
you're looking at the shore ♫

♫ At this moment, I am lost for words ♫

716
00:42:40,890 --> 00:42:43,580
♫ Close your eyes slowly ♫

♫ The wind blows past me as I zone out ♫

♫ What we experience is love ♫

729
