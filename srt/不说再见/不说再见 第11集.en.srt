[to find 70kg of drugs]

5
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,750
in a small garage in Yungang.

6
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,740
If this 70kg of methamphetamine

7
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:45,720
finds its way to Yungang,

8
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:48,800
how many lives would be ruined?

9
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,530
Being addicted to such a drug,

10
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,520
how many happy families

11
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,900
would be separated and torn apart?

12
00:01:57,729 --> 00:01:58,700
Drugs...

13
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,830
are the root of evil in this society.

14
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,890
[And drug dealers]

15
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,570
[and drug-making criminals]

16
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,210

[and would kill for money.]

00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,310
[We must not tolerate such people.]

20
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,160
I hereby announce

21
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,850
that every police officer in Yungang

22
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:22,550
will surely get rid of all drug dealers

23
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,490
and drug makers

24
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,380
that are hiding in this city.

25
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,270
We will not stop fighting.

26
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,870
We will arrest them on sight.

27
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,320
We will shut down

28
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,640
[all their drug-making sites.]

29
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,850
What are you cops doing?

30
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,610
I told you to arrest

31
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,070
Li Ruosheng and Mu Qing.

32
00:02:44,329 --> 00:02:46,620
Why are you after me instead?

33
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:49,480
The police haven't caught them yet,

34
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,030
but they already called off the operation.

35
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,890
That's not a good sign.

36
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,150
What do you mean?

37
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,170
Are you saying

38
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,210
that the police let them go on purpose?

39
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:11,560
Whether or not the police
purposely let them go,

40
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,410
I can't tell.

41
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,830
I only care

42
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:18,650
about my pork workshop.

43
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,160
You're different.

44
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,540
You're a public figure.

45
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,350
You should be more experienced

46
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,329
in handling such a situation.

47
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,970
Mu Qing has been with us

48
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,520
for over two years, right?

49
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,280
In such a short period of time,

50
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,520
he's already capable

51
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,020
of stirring up such turmoil.

52
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,270
If I say no one is backing him up,

53
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,420
will you believe that?

54
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,020
So...

55
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,370
I advise you to lay low for a while.

56
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:08,150
It's not too late

57
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:10,700
to plan it out.

58
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,670
What do you think?

59
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,540
Tell Dakun to come.

60
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,840
Sir, Dakun sent me a message just now.

61
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,290
He said the police are tailing him.

62
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,010
He needs to go into hiding for a few days.

63
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,810
He will come back
when things have died down.

64
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,909
Stop this nonsense.

65
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,800
Within a week,

66
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:54,700
I must see him.

67
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,750
Surprise!

68
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,040
Hi, welcome home.

69
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,140
Here's your wine.

70
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,980
Why are you here?

71
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,930
There was a power outage at the studio.

72
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,340
Please take me in.

73
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:50,620
You mean

74
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:52,330
you're going to stay here again?

75
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,580
Just one day.

76
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,159
Please.

77
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:59,770
Please.

78
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,710
Kexin, this is my house.

79
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,250
Can you inform me in advance

80
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,610
if you're coming over next time?

81
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,090
You were all good yesterday.

82
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,930
Now, you go back on your word.

83
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:11,960
All right.

84
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,190
Xiaobai.

85
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,430
Thank you.

86
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,530
I guess I'll have to stay

87
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,340
in a hotel on my own.

88
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,000
Come back here.

89
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,590
You're the best.

90
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,060
I got hungry while waiting for you.

91
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,380
Cook me a meal, will you?

92
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,060
Please.

93
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,940
Where are you going?

94
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,700
I'm going to cook at Li Ruosheng's place.

95
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,280
Why don't you just cook here?

96
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,820
I have nothing in the fridge.

97
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,520
Less oil, less sugar,
and no additives, okay?

98
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,190
Just wait patiently.

99
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,860
What a coincidence.

100
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,190
The moment Dakun left,

101
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,700
his garage was immediately
shut down by the police.

102
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,980
They don't have a leader now.

103
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:25,390
What do you think?

104
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,330
Let's do something about it.

105
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,850
I don't think we should rush this.

106
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,080
Why not?

107
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,100
We don't know how long Dakun will be away.

108
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,290
If he comes back,

109
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,870
we won't get the chance anymore.

110
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,630
If we touch Dakun's territory,

111
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,480
how will you explain to your godfather?

112
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,020
Act first and tell later.

113
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,350
"Act first and tell later"?

114
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:46,030
If you do that,

115
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:47,480
what should I say to your godfather

116
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,750
if he questions me afterward?

117
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:49,900
You...

118
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,190
Dakun must have another plan.

119
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,610
He's only gone temporarily to lay low.

120
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,420
It won't affect his business.

121
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:01,250
I think we should stay calm

122
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,790
especially at times like this.

123
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,790
But we have to do something.

124
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,570
I'll think of something.

125
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,000
Where are you going?

126
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,590
I want to use your kitchen

127
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,870
to cook a meal for Kexin.

128
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,450
You have all the ingredients, right?

129
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:20,390
Taking advantage of me to please her?

130
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,850
Cook for me too.

131
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,090
[Garage turns out to be
a drug dealer hideout,]

132

[revealing Yungang's
drug dealers' background!]

133
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,150
Here.

134
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,300
Less salt, less oil, and no additives.

135
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,780
Not bad, it looks good.

136
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,020
Do you train your cooking skill

137
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,560
with the ladies all the time?

138
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:55,190
That's not difficult.

139
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,600
I didn't need to season it at all.

140
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,400
It's good.

141
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:03,420
It will taste better with kale.

142
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:09,800
[I want this.]

143
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:10,990
This one.

144
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:13,890
And this one.

145
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:18,560
Plus fried rice with kale.

146
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:20,670
Kale?

147
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,030
How do we eat kale?

148
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,000
Let's not order that.

149
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,580
You don't know how good it is.

150
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,340
Fried rice with kale.

151
00:09:26,430 --> 00:09:27,800
It's my own recipe.

152
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,520
What's wrong?

153
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,080
It's nothing.

154
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:43,630
If you like kale,

155
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,910
I'll get you some tomorrow.

156
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,640
Mu Qing.

157
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,060
If you want to rise to power in the group,

158
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,210
I can help you.

159
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,740
Helping you is like helping myself.

160
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,510
Because I want to get back what's mine.

161
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,690
You don't understand?

162
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,960
My mom and I had been hurt by my dad.

163
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,640
And he had hurt us gravely.

164
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,000
Don't look at me like that.

165
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,330
I know what my dad does.

166
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,090
A few years ago,

167
00:10:33,970 --> 00:10:35,420
because of his business,

168
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:36,920
I was kidnapped.

169
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,470
A lot has happened.

170
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,430
You work for him,

171
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,720
so of course I know what you do as well.

Mu Qing.

173
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,460
You're not like Li Ruosheng.

174
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:54,560
You're a smart guy.

175
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,070
I'll help you get promoted

176
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:59,530
and you will overthrow my dad in return.

177
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,570
This deal

178
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,120
will make you gain either way.

179
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:12,640
So you want to take revenge on your dad?

180
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,680
"Take revenge" sounds too serious.

181
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,220
He's my dad after all.

182
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,500
Whatever it is you want to get back,

183
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:24,300
some things will never come back

184
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:26,460
once you lose them.

185
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,510
As for that,

186
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,230
I should know better than you.

187
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,800
Are you that confident

188
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,560
that I won't tell Mr. Ou about it?

189
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:45,990
It doesn't matter.

190
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:48,020
Go ahead and tell him.

191
00:11:49,070 --> 00:11:52,150
Let's see if he believes you or me.

192
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,830
Looking at how confident you are,

193
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,240
what other options do I have?

194
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,360
This is all because you saved me.

195
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,530
Also...

196
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,390
You even brought me home

197
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,560
and cooked for me.

198
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,880
Why are you so nervous?

199
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,170
I've told you about my plan.

200
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,540
If you need anything,

201
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,350
remember to tell me.

202
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,620
How can I help you?

203
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:30,520
Help?

204
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,640
Well...

205
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:53,940
I never thought

206
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,790
I would see you in Yungang.

207
00:13:57,290 --> 00:13:59,530
I would rather meet someone else.

208
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,950
-About Rong Yu...
-I'm not here to talk about that.

209
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,440
I've been chasing after G3307 and Spectre.

210
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,250
I hope you'll cooperate with me

211
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,100
and lure Spectre out.

212
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,060
What's your plan?

213
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,670
I plan to use my newly formed task force

214
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,220
to help you make your way up
to the upper management of Group K,

215
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,720
then earn Mr. Ou's trust.

216
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,840
Then we'll get to Spectre through Mr. Ou.

217
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,350
We think alike.

218
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,020
Okay.

219
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,090
That's good.

220
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:44,850
Rong Yao.

221
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,170
-About Rong Yu...
-I will never forgive you

222
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,670
for what happened to my sister.

223
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,440
But in this mission,

224
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,250
you're still my partner, Liu Yuanwen.

225
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,820
You can trust me completely.

226
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,550
Mr. Ou wants to see you.

227
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,350
The boss has asked to see me.

228
00:15:46,050 --> 00:15:48,210
I'm sure it's not about anything good.

229
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,830
I'm glad you know.

230
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:52,170
The garage got shut down.

231
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,930
You should at least give an explanation.

232
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,080
An explanation?

233
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,330
Why didn't you ask Mu Qing and Li Ruosheng

234
00:15:58,410 --> 00:15:59,430
to give an explanation?

235
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,710
I'm helping you out here.

236
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,560
What's important now is that

237
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:05,500
you have to put out Mr. Ou's fire first.

238
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,600
How do I do that?

239
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,140
Give me some ideas.

240
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,940
Just apologize to him.

241
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,860
He'll definitely eat me alive.

242
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:16,410
Dakun.

243
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,440
You caused this mess.

244
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,420
You have to be held responsible.

245
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,830
That's all I can say.

246
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:24,020
Take care of it yourself.

247
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,880
Goodbye.

248
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,140
There's always a way out.

249
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,470
Who says there's no one to save me?

250
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,110
The savior is right next to me.

251
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:49,190
My little savior.

252
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:52,360
Have a seat, Mr. Dakun.

253
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,230
Look at this place. It's not bad, right?

254
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,370
Not bad.

255
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,450
But you spent
a few hundred thousand on renovation.

256
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,770
You've been tricked.

257
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,660
My dad helped me with it.

258
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:09,210
Kexin, how's business?

259
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,630
You tell me.

260
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,990
The business is not going well

261
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,310
without your visit.

262
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,510
Yes, you're right.

263
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,579
I promised to visit you.

264
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,849
But I forgot about it.

265
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:20,869
I know you're busy.

266
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,270
I'm sure you've forgotten.

267
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:24,250
That's why I texted you to remind you.

268
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,440
Yes, look.

269
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,940
I also brought guests with me today.

270
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,590
Just the three of you?

271
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,150
This is just the first batch.

272
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,430
All right.

273
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,840
Let me take your measurements.

274
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:42,340
Don't bother.

275
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,140
You can just choose a few for each of us.

276
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,130
No, I only do custom orders.

277
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:48,670
Do you really have to measure?

278
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,010
Of course. It won't fit you otherwise.

279
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,600
Sure, go ahead.

280
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,760
Let's go get our measurements.

281
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,910
Mr. Dakun, this is a bargain for you.

282
00:18:01,170 --> 00:18:02,360
You pay the same price,

283
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,250
but you get more fabric than anyone else.

284
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,240
It's mostly because of my big belly.

285
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:09,090
Sir.

286
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:11,110
Our suits are all handmade.

287
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,480
It will be ready in one month.

288
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,900
The total of your suits

289
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,610
is 488,800 yuan.

290
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,770
What? How much?

291
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,400
It's 488,800 yuan.

292
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:23,780
We will collect a 20% deposit first.

293
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:27,170
This is the bill. Please take a look.

294
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,220
Will you pay with a credit card

295
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,450
or by mobile payment?

296
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,280
Kexin.

297
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,230
How about we just make mine this time?

298
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,600
They have other suits to wear.

299
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,840
Let's not make theirs first.

300
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,430
But...

301
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,690
They always follow you to many meetings.

302
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,140
If they dress up nicely,

303
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,330
you will look good too.

304
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,430
Am I right?

305
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:56,040
Am I right?

306
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,050
Yes.

307
00:18:58,940 --> 00:18:59,910
No.

308
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,360
Yes, that's correct.

309
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,840
Kexin is right.

310
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,640
Right?

311
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:11,790
I'll pay with credit card.

312
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,790
I knew it. Mr. Dakun loves me the most.

313
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,770
I'll surely tell my dad about it.

314
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,240
Then please put in a good word for me

315
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:30,880
in front of Mr. Ou.

316
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:32,070
Don't worry.

317
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,740
No problem. I will.

318
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,710
What are you doing?

319
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:50,370
You're playing
with that stupid lighter again.

320
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,220
There's no end to this, is there?

321
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:54,950
I'm thinking.

322
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,110
This thing should go back

323
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:58,510
to where it came from.

324
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,860
We also need to let your godfather see it.

325
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,670
So you're saying

326
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,920
that we should give it back to Dakun

327
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:10,130
and let him bring it to my godfather?

328
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,400
That's right.

329
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,470
Do you think Dakun is stupid?

330
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,100
How is that possible?

331
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:16,420
Why not?

332
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,200
[We caught and ripped off]

333
00:20:27,290 --> 00:20:28,300
[a fat cow today.]

334
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,030
[Come and have a good meal with me.]

335
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,140
I'm buying today.

336
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,500
Eat up.

337
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,160
Why are you looking at each other?
Are you on a blind date?

338
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,350
Come on.

339
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,600
Let's put them all in.

340
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:51,310
Ms. Ou.

341
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,250
This is not how you cook beef slices.

342
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,520
This is how you do it.

343
00:20:54,610 --> 00:20:56,280
Take them piece by piece.

344
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,910
Then boil them in the soup.

345
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,580
Did you see how much I ordered?

346
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:01,300
How can we cook them all piece by piece?

347
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:02,350
Just put them all in.

348
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:04,110
Don't leave until you finish them all.

349
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,830
You're kidding. This is a lot.

350
00:21:06,670 --> 00:21:07,630
Tell me about it.

351
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,820
Who's the lucky cow

352
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:09,970
that got ripped off by you?

353
00:21:11,070 --> 00:21:13,750
That fat cow, Mr. Dakun, of course.

354
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:16,130
He said he would come to my studio today,

355
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:17,230
so he came.

356
00:21:17,310 --> 00:21:18,500
I ripped him off nicely.

357
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:20,000
It's 200,000 yuan.

358
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,450
You didn't see his face.

359
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,080
He got so pale.

360
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,280
He actually went there.

361
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:27,830
Dakun is famous for being stingy.

362
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,650
It's because he asked me for a favor.

363
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:32,450
I can't stop him from sucking me up.

364
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,770
Others might think

365
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,620
that you two are holding a grudge.

366
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,860
Who holds a grudge against him?

367
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,110
I would be a fool not to seize the chance

368
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,120
to rip him off big-time.

369
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:42,440
Well done, cheers.

370
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:47,760
Does that mean you will continue to do so?

371
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,790
What do you think?

372
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,210
Have you heard of rainbow cake roll?

373
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,730
Isn't that what I previously...

374
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:05,580
Just buy it and you'll know.

375
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,470
Aren't there only 500 of them a day?

376
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,580
First come, first served,
and no pre-booking.

377
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:10,900
There is an event recently.

378
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,440
After buying a certain amount of it,

379
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,630
you can redeem

380
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,130
a limited edition teddy bear.

381
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,220
[There wasn't such an event last time.]

382
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,610
So you want to make Dakun

383
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,060
get you that teddy bear?

384
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,860
Getting the teddy bear is not the point.

385
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:28,060
The process is what matters.

386
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,630
I want him to line up for it himself

387
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,260
and participate in the event.

388
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,680
When he gets the teddy bear,

389
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,260
I'll have him send me home.

390
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,940
Will Dakun go home with you?

391
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,650
It's exactly what he wants.

392
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,240
When he goes back,

393
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,300
I'll put in a good word for him
in front of my dad.

394
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,330
Then we're all good.

395
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,010
He treats me well after all.

396
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,270
Do you want to join us?

397
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,730
We're fine.

398
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,290
How boring.

399
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:04,710
None of you watched over the meat.

400
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,080
-They're overcooked now.
-Come on.

401
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:07,180
-Hurry.
-Here.

402
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:08,720
Mu Qing, eat up.

403
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:09,950
Mu Qing, take all of these.

404
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:12,020
I'll have some too.

405
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,410
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Dakun.

406
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:27,900
It's okay.

407
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,630
Ms. Ou is really something.

408
00:23:30,890 --> 00:23:32,480
She can even fool

409
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,060
the ruthless Dakun around.

410
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,320
Did you get everything ready?

411
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,390
Don't worry. It's done.

412
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:44,750
I'll line up for you, Mr. Dakun.

413
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:45,720
You're all sweaty.

414
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,080
Get lost.

415
00:23:48,670 --> 00:23:51,310
Don't you see Kexin sitting there?

416
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,400
As long as she's comfortable and happy,

417
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:56,460
I'll do anything.

418
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,910
Go and stay in the car.

419
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,140
Hello, sir. How may I help you?

420
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:08,420
Quick, give me a rainbow cake roll
and that teddy bear.

421
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:09,740
Sir, please calm down.

422
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:11,370
Our teddy bear is a freebie.

423
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,430
It's not for sale.

424
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:14,060
How do I get it then?

425
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,340
You need to buy more than
ten rainbow cake rolls at once

426
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,750
to get that teddy bear.

427
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,980
Sure, give me ten of them.

428
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,080
Hurry up. Pack them up.

429
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,640
-How much is it?
-It's 2,980 yuan in total.

430
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,070
What? 2,980 yuan?

431
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,870
Are those cake rolls made of gold?

432
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,060
This is a robbery.

433
00:24:29,150 --> 00:24:30,120
Mr. Dakun.

434
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:31,700
What's wrong?

435
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,020
It's okay.

436
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,870
I'm paying.

437
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,200
-How much is it?
-It's 2,980 yuan in total.

438
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,920
It's so expensive.

439
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,630
I should pay for it.

440
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,080
How can I let you pay?

441
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,310
-I'll pay.
-Here.

442
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,750
-Payment is done.
-Thank you.

443
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:52,730
Thank you, Mr. Dakun.

444
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,090
No, you're welcome.

445
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,070
It's only right that I pay.

446
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,850
-Go and get the teddy bear.
-Okay.

447
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:02,370
About the free gift, there's another rule.

448
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,950
What rule?

449
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,830
Bend over some more.

450
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:11,690
Good job.

451
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:12,840
Good.

452
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,650
Look at how uncoordinated Dakun is.

453
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,060
He's doing his best.

454
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,350
Listen.

455
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,290
Put the teddy bear

456
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,870
together with their rainbow cake roll.

457
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,150
[What about my pork?]

458
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,560
Don't worry.

459
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,100
I'll give it to you when they leave.

460
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,150
[Okay.]

461
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,530
How can a bowl of noodles be enough

462
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,550
for so many people to share?

463
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,270
Where are the noodles?

464
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,670
The noodles are on the table.

465
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,690
Eat it while it's hot
or it will get soggy.

466
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:03,230
I'm so hungry.

467
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,380
I guess I'll eat it in my dream.

468
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,510
[Tracking]

469
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,710
It's blinking!

470
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:24,830
Look, everyone.

471
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,990
This tracking device is working again.

472
00:27:27,390 --> 00:27:28,310
Zoom in.

473
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,030
Zoom in some more.

474
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:32,840
This location...

475
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:35,440
It's in the direction to Mr. Ou's house.

476
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,680
Why are they going to Mr. Ou's house?

477
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,000
Have they figured it out?

478
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,160
No way.

479
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,200
You're saying

480
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:55,460
that Yuanwen is behind this incident?

481
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,470
That's right.

482
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,980
Yuanwen plans to use this tracking device

483
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:00,560
to make Mr. Ou be suspicious of Dakun.

484
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,240
If I were him, I would do the same.

485
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,220
I want to help Yuanwen.

486
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,410
How will you do that?

487
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,620
We should check with Yuanwen first.

488
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,820
This is what I think.

489
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:14,550
Why don't we play along with it

490
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,660
and split up Mr. Ou and Dakun completely?

491
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,230
Don't worry, Director Liu.

492
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,500
I'll act accordingly.

493
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,750
I will not hesitate when I need to act.

494
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,180
Go ahead.

495
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:43,940
That's what happened.

496
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:51,990
Dad.

497
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,500
Mr. Ou.

498
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:01,890
This cake is so good.

499
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:03,790
Mr. Dakun specially lined up
to buy it for us.

500
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,110
It took him hours.

501
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,790
Dad, take this.

502
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,760
Try it.

503
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,210
And this one.

504
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,310
[I love you.]

505
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,540
I love you.

506
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:14,570
Isn't it cute? It's for you too.

507
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,120
Look at this.

508
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,530
It's the latest model.

509
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:24,730
Mr. Dakun had someone buy it for me.

510
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,800
Isn't it gorgeous?
It's understated, yet luxurious.

511
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:28,950
It's my duty.

512
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,930
Don't be like this, Dad.

513
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,000
Mr. Dakun spent a lot of money.

514
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,470
Go and wait outside.

515
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,980
I have something to discuss with Mr. Kun.

516
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:50,910
I see.

517
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:52,180
Okay then.

518
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,860
I love you.

519
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:09,390
For the last few days,

520
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:11,810
you were busy over these things?

521
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,450
Mr. Ou.

522
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,180
Kexin finally came back from overseas.

523
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,630
As her uncle,

524
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,260
it's only right that I do these for her.

525
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:21,400
It's no big deal.

526
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:28,040
You're very close to Kexin recently.

527
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,200
You're so diligent
that you forgot I'm your boss.

528
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,180
Did you forget what you do for a living?

529
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,050
No, Mr. Ou. I...

530
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:37,630
Explain this to me.

In our group,

534
00:30:51,190 --> 00:30:53,300
no matter how much you've contributed

535
00:30:53,390 --> 00:30:54,710
or if you have zero contribution,

536
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,820
there's only one rule.

537
00:30:58,750 --> 00:30:59,900
No matter what,

538
00:30:59,990 --> 00:31:01,750
we can never let anything
affect our business.

539
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,180
I understand that, Mr. Ou.

540
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,600
I've already taken measures.

541
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,400
I have implemented
our emergency protocols.

542
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:12,130
The police won't find anything else

543
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,730
other than that little bit of stock.

544

I will never let this incident

What is our relationship?

548
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,890
I always

549
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,530
remember those days

550
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,330

00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:43,540
and shedding blood together.

What you're in charge of now

554
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,790
is the most important part of our group.

555

Yes.

00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:30,800
I hope

563
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:34,490
you can keep a close eye on him.

564

A lot has happened in the group lately.

565

Let's go and have some tea.

581
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,840
The police are inviting me for tea?

582
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:44,550
It's a huge honor.

583
00:34:44,949 --> 00:34:45,960
Did you do something bad?

584
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,719
You don't dare to drink tea
with the police?

585
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:52,870
What if I refuse?

586
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,050
Do you think you have other options?

587

You're trying to arrest me?

588
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,640
Where's the evidence?

589
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,450
China is a country governed by law.

590
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,740
You need evidence to arrest someone.

591

Who says we're arresting you?

592

593
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:13,240
I want you to cooperate
with our investigation too.

594

Okay.

I'm a law-abiding citizen. I'll cooperate.

596

Yes.

603
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:54,120

Tell me.

605
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,220
If Dakun really is the mole,

606
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:02,700
why would the police attack his turf?

607
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:08,060
Look at this.

608

What is this?

609
00:36:14,310 --> 00:36:15,450
A tracking device?

610
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,040
It was hidden in this.

611
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,730
Do you think Dakun is up to something?

612
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:24,830
Maybe he made a deal with the police.

613
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,330
The police want to catch some big fish,
