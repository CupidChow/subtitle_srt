[Episode 7]

3
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,600
I'll get going.

4
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,570
I'm leaving.

5
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,090
Dakun.

6
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,039
Xiaofoye is your man.

7
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,460
Why did he buy off Laoba the Butcher

8
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,520
to kill Mu Qing?

9
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,420
Xiaofoye is my man indeed.

10
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,490
But he doesn't have the guts

11
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,030
to hire killers

12
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,570
to assassinate our own man.

13
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,110
Could someone have given him

14
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,120
the courage to do it?

15
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,590
How dare he make a scene
in my daughter's store?

16
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,650
He even attempted to kill
my daughter's bodyguard.

17
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,380
I don't think he's only after my daughter.

18
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,570
He's after me too.

19
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,400
No.

20
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,079
Something is not right.

21
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,040
Laoba the Butcher is a top assassin.

22
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,290
Since he has honored the agreement,

23
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,390
he will keep his word.

24
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,940
He won't be all over Xiaofoye.

25
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,550
Mu Qing, you're the one who is involved.

26
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,350
Tell us what you think.

27
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,470
It's true that Xiaofoye is Dakun's man.

28
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,370
But I have more faith in Mr. Dakun

29
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,829
that he would never intend to order anyone

30
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,190
to assassinate our own men.

31
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,610
I think

32
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,160
Laoba the Butcher
must be trying to set Mr. Dakun up.

33
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,530
Mr. Dakun.

34
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,650
Do you usually have any enemies?

35
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,240
Right.

36
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:04,350
Considering how good your sales are,

37
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,370
many people must be envious of you.

38
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,100
It's inevitable that you have enemies.

39
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,370
But since he dares to defame Mr. Dakun,

40
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:16,180
this man has quite some guts.

41
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:17,640
Mr. Ou.

42
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,750
I think that Laoba the Butcher

43
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,510
is just one of many examples.

44
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,310
Are you saying

45
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,940
we should get to the bottom of this?

46
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:29,520
It's so that we can clear Dakun's name.

47
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,780
Dakun, what do you think?

48
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,150
You're the boss.

49
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:38,320
I'll do as you say.

50
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:39,860
All right.

51
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:42,230
The four of you
go back and analyze it for me.

52
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,480
I want to see who in Yungang

53
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,190
dares to go against me outright.

54
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,200
Sir.

55
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,410
I think there must be a misunderstanding.

56
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,000
You're overthinking it.

57
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,020
Then you should look into it.

58
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,910
I want a perfect answer.

59
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:00,180
That's all. You're dismissed.

60
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,690
Did you see Dakun's face?

61
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,850
It was as red and purple
as stir-fried pork liver.

62
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:16,899
It was awesome.

63
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,940
Now that Godfather has our back,

64
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:20,910
I want to see how long

65
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,530
Dakun can be so arrogant.

66
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,540
But actually,

67
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:28,870
Godfather said it very clearly just now.

68
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,470
What do you think he will do next?

69
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,110
Next?

70
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,040
He might diminish it.

71
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,800
It's such a serious matter.

72
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:39,030
How can he just diminish it?

73
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,440
You almost died.

74
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,950
So what if I die?

75
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,330
Even though he sounded like he cares,

76
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:47,170
but he already made up his mind.

77
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,810
He asked Mr. Glasses to look into it.

78
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,970
That means he doesn't want it
to turn into a big deal.

79
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,190
Honestly,

80
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,220
wouldn't it be great

81
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:00,550
if everyone could make money
together as a family?

82
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,920
Why do we have to go against each other?

83
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,380
What's the point?

84
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,140
"Family"?

85
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:08,560
You treat them like family.

86
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,450
Do they treat you as their family?

87
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,900
Now, tell me.

88
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,750
How did you

89
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,640
escape from that brat?

90
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,960
Then when you're safe,

91
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,940
why didn't you call to tell me?

92
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:48,070
My phone died. What can I do?

93
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,310
That means

94
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,550
we were obviously set up by someone.

95
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,930
If we don't play along,

96
00:05:55,409 --> 00:05:56,820
how can we walk away from this?

97
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,670
If they want to play,

98
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,120
we can only play along.

99
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,090
What's the plan?

100
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,410
Ruosheng, you'll need to do something.

101
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,380
What is it?

102
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,490
Keep an eye on Laoba the Butcher's lair.

103
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,740
What for? It's so dirty and stinky.

104
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,150
Go and you'll know.

105
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,290
Why don't you go?

106
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,720
I need to go and see

107
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,580
how Mr. Glasses investigates this case.

108
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:26,300
Look what you've done.

109
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:27,530
Get up!

110
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,010
Who was so confident the other day

111
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,080
and promised to do a good job

112
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,310
without leaving loose ends?

113
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,990
Now, look at the trouble you've caused.

114
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,060
Boss, I will bear the responsibility.

115
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,210
I won't implicate you.

116
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:41,260
It's too late.

117
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,030
Boss has already given me an earful.

118
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,320
What should we do next?

119
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,150
If I have the chance to redeem myself,

120
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,420
I'll do whatever it takes.

121
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,610
Nonsense!

122
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,690
You can't even protect yourself right now.

123
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,500
What else can I expect from you?

124
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,670
I'm telling you.

125
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,120
From now on,

126
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,940
just stay here.

127
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,170
Without my orders,

128
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,100
don't take one step out of this house.

129
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,440
Mr. Kun, we can't just let it slide.

130
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,600
Brat, I'm protecting you.

131
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,940
Just be grateful.

132
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,300
[There's an urgent matter.]

133
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,310
[Come and see me now.]

134
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:21,090
Dakun.

135
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:23,470
Glasses.

136
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:25,930
You're not doing your own work

137
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:27,300
and asked me to come here.

138
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,890
Aren't you afraid of what people will say?

139
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,890
Well, what's done is done.

140
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,169
Why should I be afraid of gossips?

141
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,690
What's the matter?

142
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,010
Just tell me.

143
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,190
I've made arrangements with the clinic.

144
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,390
As for Mr. Ou,

145
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,990
I'll explain to him on your behalf.

146
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,550
What are you talking about?

147
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,900
I don't understand.

148
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:57,920
Dakun.

149
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,910
I'm always with Mr. Ou.

150
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,940
I'm not as experienced as you

151
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,390
in dealing with the outside world.

152
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,710
But...

153
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,830
I know what's right and wrong.

154
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,130
So I acted on my own

155
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,550
and brought you Laoba the Butcher.

156
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,050
He's in the trunk.

157
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,410
He's all yours.

158
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,770
What exactly do you want?

159
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:24,580
Dakun.

160
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,310
Business is temporary.

161
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,130
But the bonds of brotherhood are for life.

162
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:32,060
So here's my advice.

163
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,400
Act carefully from now on.

164
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:50,230
I understand what you mean.

165
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,920
Glasses.

166
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,900
Okay.

167
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:58,460
Then I won't hide anything from you.

168
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:02,290
Do you really think Laoba the Butcher

169
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,670
is my Achilles heel?

170
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:07,350
You've underestimated me.

171
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,860
Boss wants you to investigate this case.

172
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,970
He just wants you to put on a show

173
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,040
for Mu Qing and Li Ruosheng to see.

174
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,750
Whether you investigate or not,

175
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,810
he wouldn't care.

176
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,020
Now, you present Laoba the Butcher to me

177
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:21,030
as a gift.

178
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,710
It's a definite win for you.

179
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,520
You're pretty good at doing business.

180
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,560
You said you're inexperienced?

181
00:10:29,530 --> 00:10:30,710
No.

182
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,750
I think it won't be long

183
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,200
before you get too greedy

184
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,180
and Yungang becomes nothing to you.

185
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,780
Dakun.

186
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:41,670
This is a matter

187
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,160
where everyone gets what they want.

188
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,670
There's no need to overthink it.

189
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,100
I've brought him to you.

190
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,560
Do you want to accept it or not?

191
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,470
Since you brought him here,

192
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,790
whether I accept or not,

193
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,330
it's not up to you.

194
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,510
Open the trunk.

195
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,650
Mr. Kun.

196
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,040
Glasses.

197
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,590
What did you say just now?

198
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,390
Returning him to me in good condition?

199
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,500
Now, I'm returning him to you.

200
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,780
And I can tell you

201
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:29,940
he's in good condition too.

202
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,450
You can take him to the boss now.

203
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,710
I'll buy you tea next time.

204
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,620
Mr. Glasses, he doesn't
appreciate our favors at all.

205
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,890
Should we...

206
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,310
He doesn't want to be indebted to us

207
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:00,210
and be under our control.

208
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,640
Let's see what happens in the future.

209
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,280
Get rid of the body.

210
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,250
Yes.

211
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,810
Is this the proof?

212
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,420
This morning,

213
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,240
I went to Laoba the Butcher's lair.

214
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:44,820
And I found this.

215
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,020
It's 2kg of methamphetamine

216
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,040
and 150,000 cash.

217
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,580
After that,

218
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,210
I sent this for a test.

219
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,020
I found out

220
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,780
that this batch of methamphetamine

221
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,100
is mixed with some counterfeits.

222
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,430
This batch of methamphetamine

223
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,230
turns out to be exactly the same

224
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,860
as the one Scorpion was selling.

225
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:04,840
Scorpion?

226
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,780
Isn't he dead?

227
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,830
Yes.

228
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,960
He was killed by Ruosheng and Mu Qing.

229
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,670
Everyone around him

230
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,080
had always wanted to seek revenge.

231
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,310
It's not weird.

232
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,950
I also found out something.

233
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,940
Laoba the Butcher and Scorpion

234
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,790
knew each other.

235
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,990
Why did he testify against Xiaofoye then?

236
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,710
He wants to sow discord between us.

237
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,350
If one plot doesn't work, another will.

238
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:31,500
These consecutive plots

239
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,610
have quite some standards.

240
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,730
Do you two have any questions?

241
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,530
Sir.

242
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:51,130
Since someone is trying
to sow discord between us,

243
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,620
then all the more reason

244
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,250
to find out who that is.

245
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,790
Otherwise,

246
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,590
he will cause us the same trouble again.

247
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,260
Then get me Xiaofoye
and Laoba the Butcher.

248
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:05,870
My bad, sir.

249
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:07,930
Last night,

250
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,960
my men went too far.

251
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,910
Laoba the Butcher is dead.

252
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,490
Xiaofoye has run away too.

253
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,270
Although the witnesses aren't here,

254
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,370
the evidence is.

255
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,890
Shall we open it and take a look?

256
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,240
It's okay, Mr. Glasses.

257
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,220
We believe you.

258
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,400
There's no need to open it.

259
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,120
We have to open it.

260
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,600
Sir, what do you think?

261
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,440
Let's take a look then.

262
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,350
This is the proof.

263
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,680
This is the proof?

264
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,440
This is the proof.

265
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,880
Are these goods or money?

266
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,290
Sir, this is...

267
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:48,700
How did it go?

268
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,510
You guessed it correctly.

269
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,280
Someone is here as soon as I arrived.

270
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:55,660
[There are 2kg of methamphetamine
and 150,000 cash.]

271
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,370
[There are some counterfeits too.]

272
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,090
[They're just like what Scorpion sold.]

273
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:01,330
It looks like they're trying

274
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,560
to put the blame on Scorpion.

275
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,319
[Since Glasses and Dakun]

276
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,420
[are causing trouble,]

277
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,369
should we get rid of them all at once?

278
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,540
We will definitely do that.

279
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,869
But we need to add one more trick.

280
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,810
Palm off a substitute for the evidence.

281
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,140
Mr. Glasses, everything is in here.

282
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:32,700
Gentlemen, please get in the car.

283
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,210
No. This...

284
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,890
There must be some mistake.

285
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,390
There must be some mistake, sir.

286
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,660
I'll find out right away.

287
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,110
I'll find out the truth.

288
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,590
Godfather.

289
00:18:04,910 --> 00:18:06,320
There must be a misunderstanding.

290
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:08,650
It seems so.

291
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,920
Mr. Glasses.

292
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,900
We did everything according to your plan.

293
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,800
Nothing went wrong in between transitions.

294
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,040
Including the methamphetamine
and the cash box,

295
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,800
they were all marked.

296
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,820
The marks were still there,

297
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,100
but where did the stuff go?

298
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:33,900
This is really strange.

299
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,940
I was careless.

300
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,770
We had really underestimated them.

301
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,060
Looking at Glasses' face,

302
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,620
I feel happy from the bottom of my heart.

303
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:07,430
Who asks him to be on Dakun's side, right?

304
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,610
I'm happy today.

305
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,280
There are wheelchairs and stretchers

306
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,250
by the entrance.

307
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,010
You're not going anywhere

308
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,420
until you're dead drunk.

309
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,870
Cheers!

310
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,670
Cheers!

311
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,590
That means

312
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,440
you chose to make Dakun

313
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:50,070
take the initiative to go against you.

314
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:55,040
Not just Dakun, Glasses too.

315
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,270
This is nonsense.

316
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,550
Don't you know

317
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,260
that will put you in danger at all times?

318
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:03,050
I think this is a good thing.

319
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,370
A good thing?

320
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,540
Glasses is helping Dakun this time

321
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,830
to take advantage of the situation
and do Dakun a favor.

322
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,150
He only sees it as a good deal.

323
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:16,550
The plot he planned this time backfired.

324
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:18,580
I'm sure he'll choose
to protect himself first.

325
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,300
That's why I had a feeling.

326
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,600
Dakun will soon give the game away.

327
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,430
I think it's time to take action.

328
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:31,120
I'll report this to the higher-ups

329
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,570
and cooperate with your plan.

330
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,030
To arrest Dakun,

331
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:37,320
we need to be well-prepared.

332
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:39,610
-We must...
-Most importantly,

333
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,370
it's to make sure of my safety.

334
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,510
Yes.

335
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,110
Next, it will be Xiaofoye.

336
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:48,100
He is Dakun's most important dealer.

337
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,170
Jimmy blew his cover this time.

338
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:52,500
We need to arrest him as soon as possible,

339
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,040
to get a hold of all the evidence

340
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,980
of Dakun's drug dealing business.

341
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,320
I'll figure out a way.

342
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,640
Are you done?

343
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,090
I want to ask you something.

344
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,500
I'll wait for you on the balcony.

345
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:21,490
What's so urgent?

346
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,690
You weren't peeking, were you?

347
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,210
Mr. Kun? Why do you ask about him?

348
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,330
Nothing. I'm just asking.

349
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:46,310
Are you sure?

350
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,980
Of course.

351
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,700
What do you think there is?

352
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,210
Don't tell me

353
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,410
you're trying to pick on him

354
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,810
just to prove yourself to my dad.

355
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,660
No way.

356
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,380
I'm not that kind of person.

357
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:02,900
I just want to ask you.

358
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:04,830
What do you know

359
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,900
about Mr. Dakun's Yungang business?

360
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,260
You and Mr. Kun work for my dad.

361
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,490
But you're asking me?

362
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,160
You should know better than I do.

363
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,930
I'm just an assistant.

364
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:18,600
I know nothing about what they do.

365
00:22:23,090 --> 00:22:24,850
Okay then. Thank you.

366
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,480
Wait.

367
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,470
I don't know right now.

368
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:31,280
But if I want to,

369
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,560
I can get all the information I want.

370
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,910
But...

371
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,620
It will not be free.

372
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,390
You're too honest.

373
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:57,630
I'll get going.

374
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:23,900
[All-kill.]

375
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,210
I keep on losing.

376
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,660
I'm done!

377
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,140
Dakun.

378
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,390
Gosh, you and your temper.

379
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,590
It's such a nice lighter.

380
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,260
It's a pity to toss it away.

381
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,730
Don't you know why I'm angry?

382
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,110
Not only did I lose a game,
but I also lost my men.

383
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,840
What do you think I should do?

384
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,020
Dakun, to tell you the truth,

385
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:57,870
I'm here today to tell you this.

386
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,300
In this round,

387
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,920
you're not the only loser.

388
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:03,890
I lost too.

389
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,660
Do you call that losing?

390
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,140
You only lost a little reputation.

391
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,130
But I lost the boss's trust in me.

392
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,820
How will I survive in the group now?

393
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,850
This is you.

394
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,100
This is Xiaofoye.

395
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,950
On which card

396
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,980
should you place all your bet?

397
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,840
You should know that better than I do.

398
00:25:08,970 --> 00:25:12,530
♫ The great big world is my love ♫

399
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,640
♫ The flowers at the foot of a mountain ♫

400
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,450
♫ Are blooming ♫

401
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:20,140
♫ What's the most upbeat tempo? ♫

402
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:24,060
♫ What's the most exciting song? ♫

403
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:27,010
♫ The curved river rises from the sky ♫

404
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:28,020
What?

405
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,780
There's a lady outside looking for you.

406
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,920
A lady?

407
00:25:31,010 --> 00:25:32,200
Ask her to come in.

408
00:25:32,370 --> 00:25:34,530
She said she has been calling you
Mr. Kun since little.

409
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,020
♫ Singing the coolest song forever ♫

410
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,670
Where is she?

411
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:48,040
Stop following me. Go back inside.

412
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,300
Kexin.

413
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,320
Mr. Kun.

414
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,210
I hope I'm not intruding.

415
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,180
No.

416
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,720
Why are you here?

417
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,440
I miss you, so I came to see you.

418
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:04,710
Look.

419
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:07,440
I kept saying I'd buy you a meal,

420
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,540
but I kept forgetting it.

421
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:09,950
I'll buy you lunch today. Come on.

422
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:10,920
Wait.

423
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,150
Actually...

424
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,760
I need your help with something.

425
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:16,940
Tell me. What is it?

426
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,280
I hope

427
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,520
you could lend me some money.

428
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,100
Borrow money? Sure, no problem.

429
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,060
How much?

430
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:30,320
Don't worry. I won't tell your dad.

431
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,430
You can never tell my dad.

432
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,360
Mr. Kun.

433
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,380
This may not be enough.

434
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,230
I need to borrow this money

435
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,520
so that I could rent a huge warehouse

436
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,190
for my clothes and other stuff.

437
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,010
That's all?

438
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,720
You can just give me a call.

439
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,170
You didn't have to come here.

440
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,930
I would like to invite you

441
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:55,930
to come with me and help me choose.

442
00:26:57,470 --> 00:26:59,750
You want me to go with you?

443
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:07,890
Mr. Kun, are you serious?

444
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:08,950
What do you think?

445
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:11,590
Look how bright it is here.

446
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:13,880
Yes, it has very good natural lighting.

447
00:27:13,970 --> 00:27:15,460
Exactly. This place is good, right?

448
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,880
It's not bad, but it's too hot.

449
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:19,510
My clothes will get ruined

450
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,700
if I hang them in here.

451
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,590
You're right.

452
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,690
Mr. Kun.

453
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,050
Is there anywhere else?

454
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:29,670
It's a little stuffy here, Mr. Kun.

455
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,270
Yes, a little bit.

456
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:34,910
Don't you think it's creepy?

457
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:36,890
-I'm scared.
-I'm scared too.

458
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,080
Let's go.

459
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,850
Later on,

460
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,790
I won't wander around with her anymore.

461
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,460
Follow her.

462
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,690
Keep her safe.

463
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,550
-But...
-No excuses.

464
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,800
She's obviously a troublemaker.

465
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,470
Take her wherever she wants to go.

466
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,360
Just be smart, okay?

467
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,420
Yes.

468
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:02,140
I feel much better
after going to the restroom.

469
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:05,220
Mr. Kun, where are we going next?

470
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,080
I don't think
I can keep you company later.

471
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,800
Something came up.

472
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,060
How could this be?

473
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,120
Look.

474
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,370
Your dad called me again.

475
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,880
It's always about my dad.

476
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,110
You only prioritize him.

477
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,380
I know.

478
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,860
No one wants me or cares about me.

479
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:28,280
Don't cry, Kexin.

480
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,180
You won't look pretty if you cry.

481
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:32,990
Is that so?

482
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:33,960
It's true.

483
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:35,850
I won't cry.

484
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:36,860
How about this?

485
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,060
I'll be back to keep you company.

486
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,100
-You said it.
-Yes.

487
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,430
It's my birthday soon. Will you come?

488
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,790
Of course.

489
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,990
I will even get you a big present.

490
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:49,310
Okay then.

491
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,160
Mr. Kun, get back to work.

492
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,990
But what about my warehouse?

493
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:55,950
How about this?

494
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,670
I'll have Xiaoli be with you.

495
00:28:58,110 --> 00:29:00,090
He has been with me for years
and he's reliable.

496
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:01,980
Remember.

497
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,180
Ms. Ou can go wherever she wants.

498
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,250
You have to satisfy her needs, okay?

499
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,220
Yes.

500
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:10,340
Ms. Ou.

501
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:15,230
Okay then. I'm counting on you.

502
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:16,370
We're leaving.

503
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,220
Come on.

504
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,020
Be careful.

505
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,300
Okay.

506
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,370
The car is so far away.

507
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,090
Why don't you carry me?

508
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,060
Okay.

509
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,700
Do you think I'm such a bad person?

510
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:37,710

you're looking at the shore ♫

681
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:09,510
♫ I hope our hearts will never sway ♫

682
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:16,460
♫ I want to fill my world up with you ♫

683
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:23,770
♫ If love is
the destination of wandering ♫

684
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:30,630
♫ Your smile blurs my sight ♫

685
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:37,360
♫ At this moment, I am lost for words ♫

686
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:40,570
♫ Close your eyes slowly ♫

687
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:44,970
♫ And let me kiss the edge of your nose ♫

688
00:42:47,090 --> 00:42:50,300
♫ The wind blows past me as I zone out ♫

689
00:42:50,390 --> 00:42:53,770
♫ When I turn around,
I lose you in the midst of a crowd ♫

690
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:57,290
♫ You are a teardrop away ♫

691
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:00,770
♫ And I shall quietly wait ♫

692
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:04,250
♫ If love never leaves us ♫

693
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:07,680
♫ This beautiful encounter ♫

694
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:10,800
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

695
00:43:10,890 --> 00:43:15,860
♫ Say goodbye ♫

696
00:43:25,850 --> 00:43:28,970
♫ The wind blows past you
as you zone out ♫

697
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,620
♫ Suddenly, I realized ♫

698
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:36,010
♫ What we experience is love ♫

699
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:39,660
♫ And time is my love confession ♫

700
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:43,140
♫ If love ever comes ♫

701
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:46,660
♫ It's the sweetest thing
I look forward to ♫

702
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:49,700
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

703
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:53,000
♫ Say goodbye ♫

704
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:58,280
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

705
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:02,720
♫ Say goodbye ♫
