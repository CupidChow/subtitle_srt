that he's meeting with Spectre,

Also,

139
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,120
given Ou Zhenhai's way of doing things,

140
00:08:56,650 --> 00:08:58,410
he won't just let things slide.

141
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,400
He'll most likely remain suspicious

142

of our undercover agent's identity.

143
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,500
He might even do a DNA test.

144

But even so,

00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,140
if there's anything suspicious,

149
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,680
they must first protect themselves

150
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,440
before making contact
with the organization.

In your heart,

167
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:07,440
has it ever occurred to you

168
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,430
that I'm a selfish person?

169
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,430
Why do you ask that?

170
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,800
Back then,

171
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:26,320
I sent you and your mom abroad

172
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,270
because I was afraid

173
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,520
someone would threaten my business.

174
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,380
Not only did I fail

00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,100
to fulfill my responsibilities as a dad,

176
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:41,580
but I also let your mom die abroad.

177
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,760
Also,

178
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:50,210
about what happened three years ago,

179
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,800
I couldn't shake it off
no matter how hard I tried.

180
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,730
You became my nightmare.

181
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:02,310
Dad.

182
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,400
But you intended to protect us

183
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,690
so that we could live a good life, right?

184
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,460
As people say,

185
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,260
things happen.

186
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,520
Now that I have

187
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,230
a lifetime's worth of money,

188
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,850
I've lost my family

189
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,320
and the person I love the most.

190
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,980
Even my men who have fought with me

191
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,950
are either dead or captured.

192
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:46,700
I mean,

193
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,560
at my age,

194
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,630
I've seen through everything.

195
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:59,240
Yet I still couldn't help but ask myself.

196
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,590
Was it all worth it?

197
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,310
You still have me.

198
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:16,400
[There is only one man]

199
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,700
[that can make me
fall in love steadfastly]

200
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,120
[in my life.]

201
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,400
[Who is he?]

202
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,420
That's you, Dad.

203
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,530
You cheeky girl.

204
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,950
[I love you.]

205
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,230
I love you.

206
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,720
Yes.

207
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,240
I have you.

208
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,560
After you came back,

209
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,610
I got to experience

210
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,030
the long-lost warmth.

211
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,460
Only then I realized

212
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,630
what life was supposed to be about.

213
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,160
No amount of money

214
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,380
can buy us a warm family.

215
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:21,740
Do you really not hate me

216
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:26,490
for what happened three years ago?

217
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,760
I said I hated you.

218
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,400
But not anymore.

219
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,600
I think

220
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,150
everything happens

221
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,750
for a reason.

222
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,490
If it wasn't for that...

223
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,500
Rong Yu!

224
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,040
Perhaps...

225
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,410
I wouldn't be who I am now,

226
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,400
nor would I be here.

227
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,530
From now on,

228
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:22,770
I'll make it up to you.

229
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,900
I promise.

230
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,150
I'll always be by your side.

231
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,290
I've reached a preliminary agreement

232
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,260
with Spectre.

233
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,860
He'll come to Yungang tomorrow

234
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,450
to finalize the details
of our cooperation.

235
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,520
-Ruosheng.
-Godfather.

236
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,370
Keep a close eye

237
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,880
on the production and the dark web deals.

238
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,160
There can be no mistakes this time.

239
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,480
Don't worry.

240
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,580
Tomorrow,

241
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,260
Mu Qing will get the money from the vault

242
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,880
and meet up with us after that.

243
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,950
I'll tell you the address

244
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,960
of the vault later.

245
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:27,810
Yes.

246
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,510
Kexin is coming with me tomorrow

247
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,400
to meet Spectre.

248
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,160
Just me?

249
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,180
But...

250
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:46,290
didn't you say

251
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,090
that Mu Qing and I...

252
00:16:48,970 --> 00:16:50,070
This is different.

253
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,860
After this deal,

254
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,410
I'll retire for good.

255
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:00,370
I want you

256
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,710
to watch me do that.

257
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,740
Okay.

258
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,080
Everyone.

259
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,490
This just came in.

260
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:34,340
Spectre is coming to Yungang tomorrow.

261
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,490
What are we waiting for?
Let's get to work.

262
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,030
Zheng Ke.

263
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:39,350
Open the map.

264
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,460
[Tracking]

265
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,400
Tomorrow, Mr. Ou leave his house

266
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,020
to pick up Spectre at Yungang Port.

267
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:53,080
Yimeng, Mr. Bao.

268
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,750
Keep a close eye on it.

269
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,720
Okay.

270
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,080
Mu Qing will go to the vault

271
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:58,580
to withdraw the money for Mr. Ou.

272
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,340
Li Ruosheng will be in the factory

273
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:02,060
to ensure the operation of the dark web.

274
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:03,680
Zheng Ke, Zhao Ran.

275
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,180
You guys follow Mu Qing.

276
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,590
Find out where Mr. Ou's vault is.

277
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,640
Yes.

278
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,360
Follow my command.

279
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,680
Once we're sure that he's Spectre,

280
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:13,450
we'll move in and take them all down.

281
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:15,170
-Got it?
-Yes!

282
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,390
Let's grab a drink.

283
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,190
Congratulations.

284
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:36,860
Once we're done with this deal,

285
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,140
the group will be yours.

286
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:41,000
What's there to congratulate?

287
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,150
To be honest,

288
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,400
I'm not happy at all.

289
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:47,990
What's wrong?

290
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,850
Mr. Ou has granted your wish

291
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,650
and left the group in your hands.

292
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,550
But you're not happy?

293
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,990
Back then,

294
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,530
I bragged about things

295
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,380
that I wanted and all.

296
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,800
Actually, I wasn't prepared at all.

297
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,040
Look.

298
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,730
If there's a hiccup or minor issue,

299
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:10,690
it's fine.

300
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,810
But if something big happens

301
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,920
and I have to deal with them,

302
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,120
I know where I stand.

303
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:19,670
I'm not as smart as you.

304
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:22,050
Be confident.

305
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,470
From now on, you're the group's leader.

306
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,480
You can't be like this.

307
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,240
Tell me. What's the point?

308
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:29,530
I'm all alone.

309
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:33,490
There's no one that I can even talk to.

310
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,650
Someone is just going to abandon me.

311
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,720
What about you and Kexin?

312
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,300
When do you plan to get married?

313
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,380
I haven't thought about it.

314
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:52,760
Besides,

315
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,430
even if I did,

316
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,360
I would have to do as she says.

317
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,460
I forgot.

318
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,870
You'll be married into her family.

319
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,320
You can't make your own call.

320
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,610
You have to do as they say.

321
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:04,990
From now on,

322
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,800
you've lost your freedom again.

323
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,280
You have to go wherever Kexin goes.

324
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:15,280
About that...

325
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,650
Not necessarily.

326
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:19,600
Perhaps she won't like me anymore.

327
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:20,780
I'll be free again then.

328
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,500
By then,

329
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,600
I'll come back to you

330
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,830
and be your strategist again.

331
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:26,150
Okay.

332
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,510
I know deep down that it's not possible.

333
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,610
But I'll take that

334
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,840
as your way of comforting me.

335
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,860
Cheers.

336
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,900
We have been together

337
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,110
for a few years now.

338
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:53,740
But sometimes,

339
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,720
you seem like a stranger to me.

340
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:56,820
I don't know why.

341
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,880
I can never tell what's on your mind

342
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,420
or what your next move is.

343
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:04,960
Even until now,

344
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,890
I dare not say for sure

345
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,740
that I know you well.

346
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,730
But it's okay.

347
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:18,030
You're my best friend.

348
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:21,280
I wouldn't be here today
if it weren't for you.

349
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,360
Wherever you are,

350
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,370
as usual,

351
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,790
I'll give you half of the money I make.

352
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:29,730
I won't take a penny from the group.

353
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,190
If you decide to quit one day

354
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,690
and want to come back,

355
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:36,770
just give me a call.

356
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,980
I'll always be here for you.

357
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:46,490
That's it.

358
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,320
[But sometimes,]

359

[you seem like a stranger to me.]

00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,270
[I don't know why.]

361
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:34,450
[I can never tell what's on your mind]

00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,050
[that I know you well.]

366
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,060
Move it.

367
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,080
[Zhao Yun from Changshan.]

368
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,930
He fought seven rounds

369
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,510
and single-handedly saved his master.

370
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:51,520
What is this called?

371
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,840
It's called loyalty!

372
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,530
Well, the one Zhao Yun
saved single-handedly

373
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,380
was Liu Adou.

374
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,880
[You're my best friend.]

375

[I wouldn't be here today

376
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:05,740
Wherever you are,

377
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,970
as usual,

378
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,390
I'll give you half of the money I make.

379
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:11,370
I won't take a penny from the group.

380
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:13,660
[If you decide to quit one day]

381

00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,670
[just give me a call.]

383
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,710
[I'll always be here for you.]

384
00:23:36,710 --> 00:23:37,590
Are you home?

385
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,260
Yes.

386
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,550
Li Ruosheng asked me to drink with him.

387
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,740
I just got back.

388
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,200
You seem to be in a bad mood.

389
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,400
It's nothing.

390
00:23:47,890 --> 00:23:49,870
I was just reminded of the past.

391
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,290
After all, Li Ruosheng and I

392
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,130
went through thick and thin for so long.

393
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,400
I get it.

394
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,350
It happens to me at times.

395
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,290
Amidst the trance,

396
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,220
I think of myself as the real Ou Kexin

397
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,860
who stays by my dad's side

398
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,930
and enjoys the warmth of a family.

399
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,000
But...

400
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,120
No matter what we've experienced together,

401
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,070
we'll stand on opposite sides in the end.

402
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,450
I know.

403
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,030
I get that.

404
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,550
After all,

405
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,530
we've been together
in the past three years.

406
00:24:28,590 --> 00:24:30,610
I watched him grow from a subordinate

407
00:24:30,830 --> 00:24:32,370
to a syndicate drug lord.

408
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,860
If we can catch Spectre tomorrow,

409
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,710
it will all be over.

410
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:46,670
They will also be punished by the law

411
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,080
for what they have done.

412
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,420
Okay. Get some rest.

413
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,440
Be careful tomorrow.

414
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,350
You too.

415
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,320
[Have you done what I told you to?]

416
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,670
Okay.

417
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,080
Wait for the ship to dock first.

418
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,140
Wait for my instructions.

419
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,030
Okay.

420
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,880
Make it quick.

421
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:16,970
[All set. Be careful.]

422
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:18,510
[We're about to depart.]

423
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:43,190
Dad.

424
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:45,080
I'm ready. Let's go.

425
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:46,050
There's no rush.

426
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,180
Aren't we leaving?

427
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,080
Drive the car now.

428
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,090
Dad, what's wrong?

429
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,720
Report.

430
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,770
Captain Rong, Mr. Ou is out.

431
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:32,780
We'll follow him now.

432
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:53,240
According to a tip from our men,

433
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:56,010
the police have their eyes on us now.

434
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,640
Sure enough,

435
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,190
that car was sent by them to tail us.

436
00:29:00,850 --> 00:29:01,770
Fortunately,

437
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,630
I've gotten two people to take our place.

438
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:06,790
It's all good. We can go now.

439
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,120
Give me your phone.

440
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,100
Don't let them trace it.

441
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,060
Mine too?

442
00:29:20,870 --> 00:29:21,750
All right. Let's go.

443
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,380
Relax.

444
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,870
Things will be fine after today.

445
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,030
I'll find a place for us

446
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:50,570
to live a peaceful life together.

447
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,150
Get in.

448

00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,450
Everything is going as planned.

451
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,460
As long as Mu Qing's phone signal
is stable,

452
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,660
we can follow him wherever he goes.

453

He got off the ring road

461
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:27,890
and headed out of town.

462

Yes.

464
