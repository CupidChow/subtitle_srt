-Team Two, follow me.
-Let's go.

Hello, this is the police.

13
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,720
My stove is still burning at home.

-The place is clear.
-Got it.

Zheng Ke, what's going on inside?

16
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,070
There are four of them in the room.

17
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,880
One of them looks aggressive.

18
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,770
The item held by the person

19
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,180
is highly likely to be a pistol.

20
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,760
Attention, everyone.

21
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,560
The suspect is probably armed.

22

-Yes.

I'm glad I made it in time. Where's Dakun?

Rong Yao, how do you explain this?

47
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,160
We didn't expect

48
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,720
that someone was helping Xiaofoye.

49
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,300
That's right.

It's a good thing there are clues now.

Xiaofoye and Dakun from Group K
have a relationship.

52

We just need to follow this line.

-When can I get the result?

Zheng Ke, how about you?

57
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,000
Yes, it's a fake number plate.

-So in the system...
-It wasn't found.

59
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:26,790
Let me ask you then.

60
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,220
How did the camera lose him?

61
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,310
In this operation,

62
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,350
one of the members disobeyed an order.

63
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,740
No communication, no reports,

64
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:50,280
and acted without authorization,

65

Can anyone explain it to me?

00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,650
I'm sorry. I acted on my own impulse.

68

I caused everyone trouble.

69

I accept my punishment.

70
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,380
It was my mistake as a conductor.

71
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:11,180
I'll accept it as well.

72
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,090
It's not up to me
as to how to deal with you.

73

It'll be decided by the research
of the Bureau's Party Committee.

Those who died were also brothers-in-arms.

102
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,840
What explanation can you give to them?

103

Dakun will still poop on us.

172
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,630
Yes. We need to kill him.

173
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,880
Let me do it.

174
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,560
Give me the gun.

175
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,020
Okay, I'll give you a chance.

176
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,160
Come on.

177
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,360
What's wrong?

178
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,440
Don't tell me you've never killed anyone.

179
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,550
Are you embarrassed to do it

180
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,180
in front of other people?

181
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:57,000
Okay, put him down.

182
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,490
Everyone, follow me out.

183
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,190
The little girl is shy.

184
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,460
All the best.

185
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,440
It's not raining.

186
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,200
Where is all this water coming from?

187
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,540
Go!

188
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:30,390
Mr. Li, this is the first time for Mr. Mu.

189
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,900
If Xiaofoye harms him...

190
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,710
Everyone has a first time.

191
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,440
No one can help him with this.

192
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,160
It's up to him.

193
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,290
Hurry up. Do it quickly.

194
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,450
I'll say it again.

195
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,830
I won't testify against Dakun.

196
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,630
I'm not like the others.

197
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,390
I'm just a businessman.

198
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,110
When I do business,

199
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,050
I don't like getting blood on my hands.

200
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,770
This is for you.

201
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,930
The flight leaves in three hours.

202
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,510
The password of the card

203
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,360
is the last few digits
of your phone number.

204
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,820
There's enough money
in there for six months.

205
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,490
What about you?

206
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,340
Don't worry about me.

207
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:24,160
Just do as I say if you want to live.

208
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:31,200
I owe you a life.

209
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,230
That's good.

210
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,560
Let's go and take a look.

211
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,640
A one-stop service
for killing and collecting corpses.

212
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,440
That's great.

213
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,950
Let's go.

214
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,400
Let's go.

215
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,380
It's fine.

216
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,580
There's a first time for everything.
Let's go.

217
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,340
Let's drink to calm your nerves.

218
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:22,590
You can't even walk.

219
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,840
This is nothing. It's just for a while.

220
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:33,720
You must be shocked.

221
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,590
Yuanwen just texted me.

222
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,700
He followed the original plan

223
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:52,550
to release Xiaofoye.

224
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:53,870
Don't worry.

225
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,110
Xiaofoye can't escape
our Sky Eye's monitor.

226
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,700
Make sure

227
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,590
Xiaofoye is safe.

228
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,260
Okay.

229
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,430
Except for having good brains,

230
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,970
you can't really do anything else.

231
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,440
What?

232
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,880
Why didn't you look at him like that
when killing him just now? How fierce.

233
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:20,230
Kill? I'll kill you!

234
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:21,240
I fell.

235
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,630
Okay, I'll stop teasing you.

236
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,750
This is your first time.
That's not bad at all.

237
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,010
I remember my first time.

238
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,310
It was nerve-racking.

239
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,760
But seriously,

240
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,090
is this something to be proud of?

241
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:41,040
It's better to use brains than hands

242
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,890
if you want to make a big business.

243
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,730
It's so tiresome to think.

244
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,580
Dakun threw out a scapegoat

245
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,170
so he could go scot-free.

246
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:50,810
I'm telling you. We have to act fast.

247
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:52,610
We can't let him bully us.

248
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:55,030
Dakun has been with Mr. Ou for so long.

249
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:56,610
It's not up to you.

250
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,710
What are you doing?

251
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,820
You asked me to stay in China,

252
00:22:10,910 --> 00:22:13,160
let me get my own studio,

253
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,740
and let people help me decorate.

254
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,190
Based on these good performances,

255
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,520
I've decided not to blame you.

256
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,710
I forgive you.

257
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,230
So?

258
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,430
So I'm going to make clothes

259
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,880
for my good father

260
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,690
to show my appreciation.

261
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,320
Why are you so nervous?

262
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:33,570
Here. Let me take your measurements.

263
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:38,540
It's for real?

264
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,080
Of course.

265
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,720
Give me your hand.

266
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:44,440
Hold it up a bit.

267
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:46,420
Don't move.

268
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,440
I thought you'd continue to fool around.

269
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,990
I didn't expect you
to open a clothing store.

270
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,980
Tell me, how did you come up with this?

271
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,740
I did this

272
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,290
because of Mu Qing.

273
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:03,050
Mu Qing?

274
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,430
He has been nagging me all day,

275
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,280
saying that I shouldn't just fool around.

276
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,860
Since I have some money,

277
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,840
I should do something more serious.

278
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,600
And I'll share some of your burdens.

279
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,690
Then I thought I could open a studio

280
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:18,490
since I care about my dad.

281
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,640
After all,

282
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,400
I studied fashion design in France.

283
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,540
I don't want to waste it.

284
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,940
That means Mu Qing changed you.

285
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,000
"Change"?

286
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:29,800
He was threatening me, okay?

287
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,400
Dad, he seldom talks,

288
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,950
but he nags more than you do.

289
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,160
I nag?

290
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,100
You do.

291
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,730
He also said that

292
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,000
once I open a studio,

293
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,760
I have to start thinking about branding

294
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:45,990
and age allocation.

295
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,370
Then he talked about marketing
after it came to branding.

296
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,610
I couldn't understand what he said.

297
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,330
No way.

298
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:54,710
Dad, do you think he wants
to make a fortune from me

299
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:56,160
by helping me launch it?

300
00:23:56,330 --> 00:23:57,260
Wait.

301
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,500
I can sponsor you

302
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,750
if you really want to do it.

303
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,370
No way.

304
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,520
I just told you.

305
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,880
I'm sharing your burden.

306
00:24:05,970 --> 00:24:07,250
How can I take your money?

307
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,530
But Dad, I think you actually
have good taste.

308
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,430
After spending some time with Mu Qing,

309
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,730
I think he is a visionary.

310
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,450
He's quite competent.

311
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,990
I always had good taste.

312
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:28,100
What a show-off.

313
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,720
It seems like you and Mu Qing

314
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,260
are getting along well.

315
00:24:39,230 --> 00:24:41,830
I always get along well with handsome men.

316
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,910
That depends on whether he can stand you.

317
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,360
You're so hot-tempered.

318
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,190
Be gentle. I haven't had lunch yet.

319
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,120
You shouldn't have said that.

320
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,590
Tell me the truth.

321
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,660
Do you like him?

322
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,910
Do you really want to know?

323
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:23,280
There is only one man

324
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:26,660
that can make me fall in love steadfastly

325
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:28,950
in my life.

326
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,900
Who is he?

327
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:40,130
That's you, Dad.

328
00:25:40,610 --> 00:25:41,890
You cheeky girl.

329
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,550
I've been back for so long.

330
00:25:46,810 --> 00:25:48,660
I've never seen you smile like that.

331
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,870
I knew you'd be happy when I came back.

332
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,590
I want you to be like this every day.

333
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:58,610
It's not that easy to be happy every day.

334
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,720
But you're right.

335
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,170
It'll make you feel better

336
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:03,750
to be with family.

337
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,780
You're happy now?

338
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,520
Then maybe it's time for me

339
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,280

507
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,920
On the other hand,

508
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,380
I want to become a member.

509
00:34:25,909 --> 00:34:27,360
We don't accept outsiders.

510
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,639
Find another place.

511
00:34:29,739 --> 00:34:31,190
I have a referral.

512
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,659
Someone who wears glasses in the West

513
00:34:34,010 --> 00:34:35,940
and someone who loves drinking tea
in the South.

514
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,000
I know them.

515
00:34:42,940 --> 00:34:44,389
What glasses does he wear?

516
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,330
What kind of tea does he drink?

517
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,920
He wears black-framed glasses.

518
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:51,610
He drinks Tieguanyin.

519
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,960
Zhao Ran is good with the rules

520
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,370
of the underworld.

521
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,970
Since it's Tieguanyin,

522
00:35:00,490 --> 00:35:02,390
you must know how much it's worth.

523
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,410
2,100 yuan for new tea,

524
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,260
double the price for loose tea.

525
00:35:06,350 --> 00:35:08,550
It's a lucrative business.

526
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,440
Do you mean

527
00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,200
you want to get some new tea?

528
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:14,930
I don't have any.

529
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:16,990
You don't.

530
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,340
But there must be a teahouse owner.

531
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,540
I'm sincere.

532
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,450
You can check it out.

533
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,290
It's me.

534
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,490
We have a new guy.

535
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,160
Watch it.

536
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:50,570
I've never seen him before.

537
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:52,630
But he is making sense.

538
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,240
All right.

539
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,990
Please enjoy the tea upstairs.

540
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,310
Here we go.

541
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:13,220
I have to go to the bathroom.

542
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:14,630
Mr. Qi, where's the bathroom?

543
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,840
This way.

544
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,350
Baby, hurry up.

545
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,100
Li Yimeng is really something.

546
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,150
She only took half a day

547
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,600
to modify the car.

548
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,100
There's room for more.

549
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:35,220
A girl's mind is like that.

550
00:36:35,310 --> 00:36:36,630
She's definitely thoughtful.

551
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,400
Yimeng and Zhao Ran,

552
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:41,910
I'll buy you dinner
after the mission is over tonight.

553
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,190
Be safe.

554
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,510
What are we having?

555
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,870
Let's go together, Mr. Bao.

556
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,500
Any unfiltered liquor?

557
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,390
I'll make sure there is.

558
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,770
Duty comes first!

559
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,820
It tastes astringent just to have tea.

560
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,840
Where's your snack?

561
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:12,580
You're a member for sure.

562
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,120
Of course.

563
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,360
And I'm not the only one.

564
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:20,280
I'm the leader of three supercars clubs.

565
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:22,300
180 people are waiting

566
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,500
to try the snacks here.

567
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,340
Usually,

568
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,450
we don't get a lot of visitors.

569
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:42,500
Since we've met each other,

570
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,360
let's skip the nonsense.

571
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:47,430
Your business here is quite good, right?

572
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,570
It's good.

573
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,420
What is this car modifying?

574
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,130
-The engine is being modified?
-Yes.

575
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:53,540
You're pretty good.

576
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:00,450
What is this car modifying?

577
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,400
The supercharger for this car.

578
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,610
How many members
do you want to sign up for?

579
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:14,710
I don't do small business.

580
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,560
Did I say it's a small business?

581
00:38:54,610 --> 00:38:55,490
Captain Rong!

582
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:59,060
Attention. Dakun's here.

583
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,070
Where's Mr. Qi?

584
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,740
He's upstairs. I'll take you there.

585
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,700
-Dakun is...
-Shut up!

586
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:39,890
Get out!

587
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:41,600
Mr. Dafeng,

588
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,420
this is Mr. Zhao from the Supercar Club.

589
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,940
I've heard a lot about you, Dafeng.

590
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:52,290
Have a seat.

591
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,920
Hey, handsome.

592
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,030
-Do you have a lighter?
-No.

593
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,520
Hey, handsome.

594
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,060
Do you have a lighter?

595
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,710
Thank you.

596
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:38,760
It's a nice interior.

597
00:40:41,790 --> 00:40:42,760
Hey.

598
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:44,870
Can you be more gentle with girls?

599
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,640
Fine, I'll give it back to you.

600
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,470
It's done.

601
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,020
I know you're busy.

602
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:06,960
I'll keep it short.

603
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,630
I'm getting the items from you

604
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,260
to sell them beyond this turf.

605
00:41:10,350 --> 00:41:11,230
I know the rules.

606
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,750
Even if it's beyond this turf,

607
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,920
it depends on whether you're qualified.

608
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,610
What are you saying?

609
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,720
Mr. Dafeng.

610
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:26,630
Don't you want the money
that's in front of you?

611
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:30,540
There is money that I can take,

612
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:34,200
but there is money that is scalding.

613
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:42,600
