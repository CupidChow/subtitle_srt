[Episode 27]

3
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,229
There's a camera near the sink.

4
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,420
Darn it.

5
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,450
Even the bathroom isn't safe.

6
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,330
What happened to Tieguanyin?

7
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,060
It happened so suddenly. How would I know?

8
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:54,000
Were you really
with Ou Kexin at that time?

9
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,820
Are you suspecting me?

10
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,730
I'm not suspecting you.

11
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,200
But it's so strange.

12
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,410
Think carefully.

13
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:12,610
Did you make any mistakes

14
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,840
and let the police find out?

15
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,690
Me?

16
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,180
Ruosheng.

17
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,990
You know how I do things.

18
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,820
That's why I'm confused.

19
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,120
How did the police get us?

20
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:28,760
Yes.

21
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,850
Who did it?

22
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,940
But no matter what,

23
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,060
at least it's not one of us.

24
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,590
That only leaves Congtou.

25
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,250
Why are you denying your connection

26
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,400
with Liu Qingqing?

27
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,310
Are you feeling guilty?

28
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,120
What do you mean by that?

29
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,360
Why are you always talking about her?

30
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,900
You're funny.

31
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:17,380
I don't care about your nonsense.

32
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,490
If you were single,
you could have fun however you want

33
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:20,500
[and with whomever you want.]

34
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,860
[I would even join you.]

35
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,110
[But you have a girlfriend now.]

36
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,130
[Don't you feel sorry for Ou Kexin?]

37
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,760
[I didn't do anything to Ou Kexin.]

38
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,690
[Have you seen me done anything to her?]

39
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:31,590
You like Liu Qingqing,

40
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,730
but she doesn't like you.

41
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,050
That's due to your incompetence.

42
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,110
It's not my fault.

43
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,070
"Incompetence"?

44
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,410
Congtou, did you hear that?

45
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,530
He thinks I'm incompetent.

46
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,440
Do you have a conscience?

47
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,990
If it weren't for me,

48
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,500
you'd still be a security guard at a bar!

49
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:54,640
My gosh.

50
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:56,970
Who was the one that insisted

51
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,560
that I become his strategist?

52
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,140
Li Ruosheng, let me tell you.

53
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:03,350
Without me, you wouldn't be here today!

54
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,890
Guys, stop fighting.

55
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:09,290
We're already in a mess.

56
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,660
[My brain hurts.]

57
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,050
They're so young and impulsive.

58
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:15,540
They're really fighting.

59
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,709
It looks like

60
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,560
there's nothing wrong.

61
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,130
That's what it seems like.

62
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,990
But that doesn't mean it's the truth.

63
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,680
It was indeed Congtou's truck.

64
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,090
Maybe he was careless.

65
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,550
Maybe it was on purpose.

66
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,080
Tieguanyin has always been cautious.

67
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,770
She sent Liu Qingqing to the factory.

68
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,310
Why did she go as well?

69
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:46,030
Besides,

70
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:49,470
how did she get caught by the police?

71
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:53,070
That's the point of this whole thing.

72
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:01,260
I'll tell you a fact.

73
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,550
I'm Mr. Ou's godson.

74
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:05,440
That makes Ou Kexin my sister.

75
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,030
If you ever do her wrong,

76
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,970
I'll come for you.

77
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,550
I didn't do her wrong.

78
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,400
Did you see me do anything wrong to her?

79
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,980
-You're crazy!
-What are you doing?

80
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,260
[What are you doing?]

81
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,840
-Kexin is here.
[-What are you doing?]

82
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,600
Remember.

83
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,850
Don't tell her we're looking for a mole.

84
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:22,820
I understand.

85
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,780
Who did me wrong?

86
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,840
Ask him!

87
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,480
Even if he did,

88
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:28,840
it's between me and him.

89
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,430
Why are you yelling at him?

90
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,480
Qingqing.

91
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,760
Don't be angry. Are you okay?

92
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,440
He's crazy. Ignore him.

93
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,980
[Who are you calling crazy?]

94
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,159
[-Say it again!]
[-What are you doing?]

95
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,500
[-I called you crazy, so what?]
[-Why are you arguing?]

96
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,990
[What are you doing?]

97
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:49,659
Congtou is here too?

98
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,780
Wait.

99
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,080
Why are all three of you at my house?

100
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,490
Congtou.

101
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:58,940
What's happening?

102
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,180
Nothing. I'm just drinking.

103
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,860
Just drinking?

104
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,160
Tell me.

105
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:07,300
What is happening?

106
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,440
My brother.

107
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,470
I'm just being nosy here.

108
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:14,910
What a waste of time. Qingqing.

109
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,540
Qingqing.

110
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,560
What's going on?

111
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,100
What are you guys doing?

112
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,860
Mr. Ou asked us to come

113
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,040
for business matters.

114
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,240
We have to stay here

115
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,400
for a few days.

116
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,980
We might as well tell them

117
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,080
that it's time to eat.

118
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,570
Okay.

119
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:39,900
Even if it's for business,

120
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:41,750
why do you need to stay here for days?

121
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,390
Li Ruosheng, tell me.

122
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,550
Why is that?

123
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,230
Kexin is here too?

124
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,480
Mr. Glasses, you're just in time.

125
00:06:55,570 --> 00:06:56,620
They just told me

126
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,810
there's a business meeting,

127
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,950
so they're staying with us.

128
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,970
What's going on?

129
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,250
Let's put business aside for now.

130
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,280
Mr. Ou is inviting you to eat.

131
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,640
Come, let's go upstairs.

132
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,650
It's time to eat?

133
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:07,890
That's good. I'm starving.

134
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,160
Qingqing.

135
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,830
Let's go eat.

136
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,990
Let's go.

137
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:25,350
Dad, everyone is here today.

138
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,890
What's going on?

139
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,810
It's business matters. Don't mind it.

140
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,360
Then I want in.

141
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,180
Otherwise, I would be the only outsider.

142
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,320
Kexin.

143
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,770
After this meal,

144
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:40,050
we'll have a meeting.

145
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:41,190
It will be boring.

146
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,470
You won't like it.

147
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,540
A meeting is fine.

148
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,790
You should have a schedule then.

149
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,600
Why are you asking so much?

150
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,230
It's about the group.

151
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:52,990
Just focus on your date.

152
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:54,530
What date?

153
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,610
Are you talking about Huang Boyuan?

154
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,190
I told you since the beginning

155
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,600
that I don't like him.

156
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,750
It makes me angry hearing his name.

157
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,170
What's wrong?

158
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,590
He's terrible.

159
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,530
He even disappeared this morning.

160
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,510
He disappeared?

161
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,230
What happened?

162
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:15,820
Wasn't he always trying to ask me out?

163
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,190
I didn't want to.

164
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:19,560
But out of nowhere, he found out

165
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,450
that there's an exhibit I wanted to see.

166
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,610
The tickets were sold out
three months ago.

167
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:24,970
He said he had tickets.

168
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,870
That's why I agreed
to go on a date with him.

169
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,450
But do you know what happened?

170
00:08:28,670 --> 00:08:30,380
He stood me up.

171
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,400
I was stood up

172
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,720
for the first time in my life.

173
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,559
I waited outside for over an hour.

174
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,240
In the end,

175
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,260
Mu Qing was the one who picked me up.

176
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,500
That means

177
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,620
Mu Qing was with Kexin this whole morning?

178
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,160
Of course.

179
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,180
After he picked me up,

180
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,030
I just missed Guanyin.

181
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,880
But she didn't answer my call.

182
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:55,420
So we went to her house.

183
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,870
She didn't answer the door either.

184
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,040
Speaking of which,

185
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,230
since you're all here,

186
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,500
why isn't Guanyin here?

187
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,230
Go home after you eat.

188
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,990
We have things to discuss.

189
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,370
You're so secretive.

190
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,040
Fine, forget it.

191
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,680
Here.

192
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,400
Mu Qing, you've worked hard.

193
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,720
Have some more.

194
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,210
I'll help myself.

195
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,440
Give it a thought.

196
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,760
See if you want to eat anything,

197
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:22,220
I'll bring it to you tomorrow.

198
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,770
It's okay. I don't want anything.

199
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,660
You're so ungrateful.

200
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,020
What did you say?

201
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,370
You don't know how lucky you are.

202
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,340
Ruosheng.

203
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,010
Mr. Ou is here.

204
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,550
I'm not doing this now.

205
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,560
Just eat.

206
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,140
It's exactly because Godfather is here

207
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,820
that I want to tell you.

208
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,660
I hate that you have it all,

209
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,070
but you're still looking for more.

210
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,740
-Mr. Ou...
-That's enough!

211
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:46,770
Are you done?

212
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,140
Don't let me see you
fight over this again.

213
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:52,930
That's enough. Let's eat and be happy.

214
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:54,120
How about this?

215
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,830
I'll call you tomorrow.

216
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,110
Tell me if you want anything.

217
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:00,940
Our phones were confiscated.

218
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,380
Even your phones were confiscated?

219
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:06,830
Dad.

220
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,890
I won't be able to hear

221
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,210
from Mu Qing for days.

222
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,310
That's not right.

223
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,550
You won't do anything

224
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:14,490
to Mu Qing, will you?

225
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,740
What can I do to him?

226
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,190
Then why did you...

227
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,560
Kexin.

228
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,530
Don't worry.

229
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,020
You should go home afterward.

230
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:29,010
Okay, I'll do as you say.

231
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:30,410
Eat up.

00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:31,370
"Used to be"?

343
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,920
I hope you and Yuanwen

344
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,470
can be friends and comrades forever.

345
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,100
You know

346
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:40,210
that he's having a hard time in Group K.

347
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:41,660
He's all alone.

348
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,360
Don't worry.

349
00:18:46,150 --> 00:18:47,650
I'll cooperate with Yuanwen.

350
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,540
Your mission right now

351
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,740
is to go to bed after breakfast.

352
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:54,510
The mission isn't over. How can I sleep?

353
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:56,400
I'll go back to work after this.

354
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,430
This kind of temperament...

355
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,190
They're just the same.

356
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,940
How long do we have to wait?

357
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:25,310
I'm having dinner with a friend.

358
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,690
We don't know.

359
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:29,140
That's up to Mr. Ou.

360
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:32,480
Okay.

361
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,900
Let me borrow your phone.

362
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,240
I'll call my friend, okay?

363
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,250
I can't let you do that.

364
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,520
Mr. Ou said

365
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:40,670
before you leave,

366
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,990
you can't have your phone back.

367
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,480
-I...
-Come on, Congtou.

368
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,200
You're so stressed.

369
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,970
Are you meeting a pretty lady?

370
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,250
Let me give you a tip.

371
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,670
Bring her here. I'll accompany her.

372
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,600
Look at the situation.

373
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:55,320
Are you in the mood to joke around?

374
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:57,120
It's because you kept saying

375
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,800
that there was a mole.

376
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,980
That's why we're here.

377
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:01,000
Who are you blaming?

378
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,580
Is it my fault?

379
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,470
Is it my fault?

380
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,840
I'm telling you.

381
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:08,170
I meant what I said.

382
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,840
Think about it.

383
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,170
Wasn't it strange what happened to Dakun?

384
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:14,680
Tieguanyin was also arrested.

385
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,060
How can your godfather not be suspicious?

386
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,730
Darn you.

387
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:27,530
Besides,

388
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,730
are you sure there's no mole

389
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,880
among the three of us?

390
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,390
What do you mean?

391
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,980
What do you think?

392
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:41,300
What's wrong?

393
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,100
Are you confessing?

394
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,620
Congtou.

395
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,790
If we start fighting right now,

396
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:52,080
it won't matter who the mole is.

397
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,190
Because knowing Mr. Ou,

398
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,860
he won't go easy on us.

399
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:57,710
I'm warning you.

400
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,600
Think before you talk.

401
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,890
I've thought about it carefully.

402
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,490
Do you see this?

403
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,380
He's nervous.

404
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,570
Whoever the mole is,

405
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,900
it's not up to you and me.

406
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,970
It's for Mr. Ou to decide.

407
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,090
We're all comrades of the group.

408
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,210
We can't avoid each other.

409
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:22,750
We still have a business to do.

410
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:25,080
If you say anything wrong

411
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,570
or accuse the wrong person,

412
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,860
it will be your loss.

413
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,250
Congtou.

414
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,670
Give yourself a break.

415
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,840
It's to keep yourself alive.

416
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,090
You're talking to me, right?

417
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,630
I'll kill you.

418
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,140
Congtou.

419
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,780
Calm down. What are you doing?

420
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,540
He's provoking you.

421
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:50,770
Don't fall for his trick.

422
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,010
He's not worth it.

423
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,030
Fine.

424
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,350
You brat.

425
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,020
We'll see.

426
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,690
What are you looking at?

427
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,000
Is it fun?

428
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,100
Go over there!

429
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,920
[Stay away from me.]

430
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:14,710
Here.

431
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:16,560
Tell me.

432
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:19,900
What is a mole most afraid of?

433
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:23,950
I supposed it's being exposed.

434
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:26,900
Being exposed is just the end result.

435
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:30,330
The mole is afraid of something else.

436
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,790
Sir.

437
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,040
I don't understand what you mean.

438
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,190
Go and tell them

439
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,170
that our people are checking

440
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,800
the police department.

441
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:45,020
Are you putting pressure on them?

442
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,430
Rather than the result,

443
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,980
the process of gradually getting exposed

444
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,440
is much more terrifying.

445
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,460
Let's scare him.

446
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,400
I get it.

447
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:31,400
What is this, Mr. Glasses?

448
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,160
How long do I have to stay here?

449
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,760
Don't worry. We'll hear from them soon.

450
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:36,900
Hear what?

451
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,350
News about the mole.

452
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:44,200
[Mr. Ou is looking into it.]

453
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,050
[To be precise,]

454
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,720
someone in the police department

455
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:48,910
is looking into it.

456
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,770
Godfather is so good.

457
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,660
He has people among the police.

458
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:56,610
It seems they're not that impenetrable.

459
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,040
I can tell you this for sure.

460
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,900
Our man in the police has told us.

461
00:24:04,570 --> 00:24:06,420
There's a mole within our group.

462
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,410
Hold on.

463
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,820
Wait.

464
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,270
Within the group?

465
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:13,770
What does this mean?

466
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,540
Is there a mole within the group?

467
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,080
Or is there a mole

468
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,270
among the three of us?

469
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,170
What's the difference?

470
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,800
[Of course it's different.]

471
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,560
[In our entire group,]

472
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,850
[from distribution to shipping]

473
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,300
[and delivery,]

474
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,110
[there must be more than 30 people.]

475
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:33,000
[If you count everyone,]

476
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,320
[that's 60 to 70 people.]

477
00:24:34,410 --> 00:24:36,560
[Who knows where the mole is?]

478
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,410
But I just have one question.

479
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,040
Why am I detained here?

480
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,270
How can you suspect me?

481
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,940
That's a little unfair.

482
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,260
Congtou.

483
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,030
Nobody is saying you're the mole.

484
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,790
Why are you getting nervous?

485
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,070
Why can't I be nervous?

486
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,700
Why can't I?

487
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,930
[Right now,]

488
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,560
[everything we're doing]

489
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,360
[can be heard and seen by Mr. Ou.]

490
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,050
[I'm just trying to be nice]

491
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,150
[and remind you.]

492
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,170
If anyone is falsely accused,

493
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,500
our people will be disappointed.

494
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,200
Mu Qing.

495
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,110
Do you have anything to say?

496
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,330
I have nothing to say.

497
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,670
Ruosheng.

498
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,390
What about you?

499
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:25,970
Mr. Glasses.

500
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,480
What do you think I should say?

501
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,060
Sir.

502
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,920
I've told them what you asked.

503
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,610
I know.

504
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,130
Congtou was right.

505
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,420
If we get the wrong person,

506
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,190
our men will question us.

507
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,130
I thought I was the one asking questions.

508
00:26:02,490 --> 00:26:03,550
It turns out

509
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,310
that I have to make a choice too.

510
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,390
Call Pangzi.

511
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,760
We need to get the kid from the hospital.

512
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,610
The bell rang.

513
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:31,930
We...

514
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,760
Who are you looking for?

515
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,300
Are you Xiaoxiao?

516
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,720
Yes, who are you?

517
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,080
We are police officers,

518
00:26:41,170 --> 00:26:42,620
your dad's colleagues.

519
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:45,170
Your dad asked us to pick you up.

520
00:26:45,350 --> 00:26:47,280
When he gets off from work,

521
00:26:47,370 --> 00:26:48,960
he'll come to my house to pick you up.

522
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,990
-Okay.
-That's great.

523
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,860
Here, put this on.

524
00:26:58,370 --> 00:26:59,340
Let's go.

525
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,050
Sir.

526
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,860
Why doesn't my dad pick me up himself?

527
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:09,460
Your dad is busy with work.

528
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,800
Besides, the hospital said you can leave.

529
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:15,180
That's why your dad asked us to get you.

530
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,190
We'll see him soon.

531
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,250
Are you happy?

532
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,840
Yes. Thank you, sir.

533
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:21,250
You're welcome.

534
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:35,590
Xiaoxiao.

535
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,740
Are you playing hide-and-seek again?

536
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,060
Xiaoxiao.

537
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,340
I'm here.

538
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,570
Hello?

539
00:28:13,830 --> 00:28:14,970
[Stop looking for her.]

540
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:17,090
[I have your daughter.]

541
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,510
[She likes this place]

542
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,830
[more than the hospital.]

543
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,190
Who are you?

544
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,600
That's not important.

545
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,710
What's important is your daughter.

546
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,200
Such a good girl

547
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,930
is diagnosed with this disease.

548
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,610
[But she has a poor dad.]

549
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,210
She's so young.

550
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:41,200
I feel bad for her.

551
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,000
Where is she?

552
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,280
Don't hurt her.

553
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,660
You are a police officer.

554
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,900
But I believe

555
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,920
that you're also a loving dad

556
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:55,940
to your daughter.

557
00:28:56,770 --> 00:28:58,400
Who are you people?

558
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,030
[I'm just someone]

559
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,140
[who's not against you.]

560
00:29:02,670 --> 00:29:03,900
I'm not trying to hurt you.

561
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,220
I'm trying to help you.

562
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,090
I can pay for your daughter's surgery.

563
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:12,260
I can find a kidney donor for her too.

564
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,670
But...

565
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:16,880
I need information.

566
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,300
This is outrageous.

567
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,760
How dare you threaten me with my daughter?

568
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,720
It's not a threat, but cooperation.

569
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:28,720
If you do as I say,

570
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,000
I can keep your daughter safe.

571
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,790
What do you need me to do?

572
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,100
I need to know

573
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,680
who's the undercover agent.

574
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:44,860
You're with Group K.

575
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,400
It doesn't matter who I am.

576
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,970
If you do as I say,

577
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:57,230
you'll have a chance to see your daughter.

578
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:01,360
[We have people in the bureau too.]

579
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,710
[I'll know]

580
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,000
[every move you make.]

581
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:10,690
[And from now on,]

582
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,230
[your code name will be Luotuo.]

583
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,120
Captain Rong.

584
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:44,310
I have to speak with you.

585
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:45,320
What's wrong?

586
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,780
[Handle cases according to the law]

587
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,000
What's wrong, Zheng Ke?

588
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,510
Captain, my daughter, Xiaoxiao,

589
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,530
has been kidnapped by Group K.

590
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,370
How dare they?

591
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:00,150
Director Liu.

592
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,730
This is serious.

593
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,680
Firstly, we don't know where she is

594
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,170
and how hard it is to rescue her.

595
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,930
Secondly, Spectre hasn't appeared yet.

596
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,170
Mu Qing and Skylark

597
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,530
haven't gotten to their core.

598
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,550
If we make a move now,

599
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,620
it might ruin our entire plan.

600
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,030
What are you going to do?

601
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,670
Tieguanyin's arrest

602
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,780
made Group K realize

603
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,470
that we have an agent among them.

604
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:25,360
Zheng Ke specifically mentioned

605
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:26,990
that the man said

606
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,570
there's a mole in our department

607
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:30,240
watching Zheng Ke's every move.

608
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,490
I believe they're not bluffing.

609
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:34,910
We need to start
an internal investigation.

610
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,360
If we look into the mole now,

611
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,470
Mr. Ou will know

612
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,290
that Zheng Ke has told us everything.

613
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,100
Zheng Yixiao will be in danger.

614
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,770
So you're saying

615
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,750
that we should put on a show.

616
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,160
It's not just that.

617
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,320
We have to put on a huge show

618
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:54,000
and pretend to be clueless.

619
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,860
Before we figure out if there's a mole,

620
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,500
Task Force 84's operations

621
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,830
have to be done outside the office.

622
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,290
I understand.

623
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,070
Director Liu.

624
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:08,700
I have a suggestion.

625
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,810
-It's him.
-Answer it.

626
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,070
Hello.

627
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,560
I saw the pictures.

628
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:43,410
[What do you think?]

629
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,920
Did I prove my sincerity?

630
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,310
I need information about the agent.

631
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,290
How is Xiaoxiao?

632
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,560
She's fine.

633
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,980
[I want to hear her voice.]

634
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:57,010
She's asleep.

635
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:00,260
Call me back with something useful.

636
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,800
[Hold on.]

637
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,180
My daughter is very sick.

638
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,130
Please release her.

639
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:08,760
[Of course...]

640
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,910
[I can offer you]

641
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,890
something important.

642
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,210
[I'm listening.]

643
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,060
About the undercover agent,

644
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:17,910
give me three days.

645
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,150
I'll give you the information by then.

646
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,160
Three days?

647
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,840
I can't wait three days.

648
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,300
Three days is the minimum.

649
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,200
Three days later, at 9 p.m.,

650
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:30,180
send someone to meet me.

651
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:32,080
I'll let you know the location then.

652
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,080
When I give you the information,

653
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:38,020
you have to bring Xiaoxiao.

654
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,660
You have nothing to bargain with.

655
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,120
Either you deliver the information

656
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:44,840
or you won't see your daughter again.

657
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,820
Think it through.

658
00:33:47,390 --> 00:33:48,800
Xiaoxiao is all I have.

659
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:53,110
But our undercover agent in Group K

660
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:55,310
is also important.

661
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:56,930
[A life for a life.]

662
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,090
[It's a good deal for you.]

663
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:01,110
[Three days isn't that long.]

664
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,050
You should have patience.

665
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,880
So...

666
00:34:07,050 --> 00:34:09,030
You're the one
who should think it through.

667
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:10,880
Sure.

668
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:13,920
Three days it is then.

669
00:34:14,139 --> 00:34:16,650
But I'll choose the place.

670
00:34:16,949 --> 00:34:17,920
Okay.

671
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,989
You can pick the place.

672
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,360
Stall him.

673
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:37,719
Buy us some time.

674
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:39,790
Zheng Ke.

675
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,370
You did a great job.

676
00:34:58,890 --> 00:34:59,770
Mu Qing.

677
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:02,230
Can't you speak?

678
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,660
Do you really think

679
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,040
that you can get away from this again?

680
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,330
Tieguanyin made a deal with you.

681
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,650
Now, she has been arrested.

682
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:13,230
What?

683
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,030
Are you pretending

684
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,450
that you have nothing to do with it?

685
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:20,970
So you think

686
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:22,950
that I'm the mole.

687
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:23,920
Yes.

688
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,290
It's you.

689
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,130
I'm pretty sure.

690
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,380
I'm telling you.

691
00:35:29,950 --> 00:35:31,450
We're in Mr. Ou's house now.

692
00:35:32,190 --> 00:35:33,160
Otherwise,

693
00:35:33,430 --> 00:35:34,970
I would have killed you by now.

694
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,920
Aren't you afraid that

695
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,300
Mr. Ou will find out what you've done?

696
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,540
Sir.

697
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,230
Sit down, all of you.

698
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,430
Mu Qing.

699
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,560
Everything you said about Congtou,

700
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,320
I haven't heard about it.

701
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,210
Tell me more.

702
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,390
Sir.

703
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,200
This has nothing to do with the mole.

704
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,480
I'll decide.

705
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:19,710
Tell me.

706
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,980
Guanyin was arrested

707
00:36:24,950 --> 00:36:26,660
because our shipping truck

708
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,160
was tagged by the police.

709
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,660
What are you saying?

710
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,530
I've been wondering.

711
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,830
Congtou, you're always so skilled.

712
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,720
There has never been a problem.

713
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,480
Mr. Ou trusts you a lot.

714
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,590
But why is it that this time,

715
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,910
your delivery truck

716
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,500
was tagged by the police?

717
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:46,730
Mu Qing.

718
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,590
What are you trying to say?

719
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,440
Do you think that I don't know

720
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,680
about your deal with Tieguanyin?

721
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,310
Now, you're blaming me?

722
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,580
What are you trying to do?

723
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,920
Do you really think we're idiots?

724
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,250
How did you know Guanyin and I had a deal?

725
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,320
Don't tell me you and Ruosheng

726
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,080
aren't doing anything in secret.

727
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,250
I know you want to work on your own.

728
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:16,030
You're well aware of what you've done.

729
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:17,750
You want to earn money

730
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,800
in such a short time.

731
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,090
What is your motive?

732
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,850
Shut your mouth, you brat.

733
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,580
I've been working for Mr. Ou

734
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,590
for so many years.

735
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,230
You're in no position to judge me.

736
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,650
Sir, I'm being honest.

737
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,850
Before he came,

738
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,650
our group was doing fine.

739
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,370
After he came,

740
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,650
Dakun betrayed us

741
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,050
and Tieguanyin was arrested.

742
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,730
It's always related to this kid.

743
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,060
And he always gets away with it

744
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,200
and reaps all the benefits.

745
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:47,360
You're clearly the mole.

746
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,460
From what you said,

747
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:54,790
it seems like I'm responsible too.

748
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,160
Ruosheng.

749
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:59,410
Don't you think that he's the mole?

750
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,050
What a joke.

751
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:10,630
Ruosheng and I

752
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,790
had a little argument lately.

753
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,420
But it's just a tantrum

754
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,870
between best friends.

755
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,100
It's no big deal.

756
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,390
If you hold me responsible for everything

757
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,150
that happened to the group,

758
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,480
then you're giving me too much credit.

759
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:28,980
Mr. Dakun betrayed us long ago.

760
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:30,960
Guanyin had a secret business.

761
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,240
It's all true.

762
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,260
You're fighting over your own greed.

763
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,450
Why is that my fault?

764
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:38,090
If you want to put the blame on me,

765
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:41,130
let's see if your hands are clean first.

766
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,020
Sir, I...

767
00:38:49,270 --> 00:38:51,290
Mu Qing has a point.

768
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,310
I already knew

769
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:56,040
about your secret hideout in the east.

770
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,340
I understand.

771
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,480
It's because of greed.

772
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,610
But you got into trouble for it

773
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,020
and got Tieguanyin involved.

774
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,690
As for both of you,

775
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:14,170
you parted ways just for a woman?

776
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,380
Is that what ambitious men do?

777
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,870
As for the mole, it's a different story.

778
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,540
Mu Qing.

779
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,770
Follow me.

780
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,690
Why are you in such a hurry to see me?

781
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:03,840
There are two tasks.

782
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,210
You need to do them fast.

783
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,630
First, tell Yuanwen

784
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:08,950
that Mr. Ou failed

785
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,310
to turn our man against us.

786
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,540
Tell him not to worry

787
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:12,730
and not to act strangely.

788
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,020
I know.

789
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,950
What's the other one?

790
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:21,800
The second thing

791
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:24,220
is tricky.

793
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,660
Relax.

794
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,080
I just want to get to know you better.

795
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,500
Sir.

796
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:45,690
I'm not nervous at all.

797
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:49,870
Will you play the black or white stones?

798
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:54,880
How about this, sir?

799
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,740
Here's how we'll decide

800
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,410
who will play the white stones

801
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,090
and who will play the black stones.

802
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,300
By guessing odd or even?

803
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,720
I think it's better to let fate decide.

804
00:41:07,690 --> 00:41:09,050
Black is even and white is odd.

805
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:11,690
Which one will you pick?

806
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,150
Odd or even?

807
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:20,750
Odds aren't in pairs.

808
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,390
While they are free-spirited,

809
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:26,210
I'd rather have someone helping me.

810

♫ So I'm afraid to be reminded ♫

00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:03,380
♫ That I miss you ♫
