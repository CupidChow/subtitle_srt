[Collect the laundry tonight.]

4
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,720
Ms. Ou,

5
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,260
I can't go shopping with you.

6
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,240
I have something very important to handle.

7
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,260
I'll drop you off first. Let's go.

8
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,540
I haven't finished yet.

9
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,720
Let's go.

10
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,220
Is this how it works for you?

11
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,780
No, it's too dangerous.

12
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,329
Then tell me.

13
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,740
What's a better way?

14
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,110
Why would I ask you if I had a better way?

15
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:26,120
Set it up just like we agreed.

16
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,300
Also,

17
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,500
don't let Dakun realize anything.

18
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,770
Okay.

19
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,340
Great, Mr. Scorpion.

20
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,700
You're really something.

21
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,640
We substituted for good

22
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,280
and reap the benefits
using the name of Group K.

23
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,860
He can't find us either.

24
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,440
That's great, Mr. Scorpion.

25
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,170
Group K is an elephant.

26
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,210
What are we?

27
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,510
A mouse.

28
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,490
But sometimes,

29
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,080
even a mouse can kill an elephant.

30
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:13,370
It's when the mouse

31
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,880
gets into the elephant's trunk.

32
00:03:17,329 --> 00:03:18,520
Next,

33
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,150
when we've made enough money,

34
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,430
we'll be able

35
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,370
to compete with Group K.

36
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,740
Hurry, turn off the lights.

37
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:02,870
Mr. Scorpion.

38
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:04,850
It's so dark.

39
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,610
What can you see?

40
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,900
It's Li Ruosheng and Mu Qing.

41
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,329
We, Mu Qing and Li Ruosheng,

42
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,829
came here for a friendly visit.

43
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,000
I hope Mr. Scorpion
can do me a favor and meet us.

44
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:23,680
Mr. Scorpion, there are only two of them.
What should we do?

45
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,600
Make sure there's no one else.

46
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,500
Yes.

47
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,260
Those kids,

48
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:33,980
they have a lot of guts.

49
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:37,500
Mr. Scorpion, we're here to talk business.

50
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,610
Please let us in.

51
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,250
Mr. Scorpion, let's just kill them.

52
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,680
Li Ruosheng is the godson of the Ou.

53
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:47,659
We may get in trouble.

54
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,830
It's okay.

55
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,320
What can they do to us

56
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:54,130
with just two of them?

57
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,860
Grab your weapons. Let's go.

58
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:02,930
So you're inside, Mr. Scorpion.

59
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,380
You didn't answer us.

60
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,050
We've been yelling for so long.

61
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,780
You two are looking for me?

62
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,000
Mr. Scorpion, we just want
to talk business with you.

63
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:14,190
Business is good.

64
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:16,300
Hand over the weapons.

65
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,690
There are no weapons
when it comes to business.

66
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,660
Come on.

67
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:25,680
Nothing.

68
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,820
Nothing.

69
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,000
How did you find me?

70
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,930
It's easy to find a peer in the group.

71
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,000
But Mr. Scorpion, don't worry.

72
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,490
This time,

73
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,080
we are here with sincerity.

74
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,260
Go check it.

75
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,450
It's Ephedrine.

76
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,010
Mr. Scorpion,

77
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:23,090
you should trust us now.

78
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:27,140
What's the meaning of this?

79
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:29,250
Just one thing.

80
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,430
Mr. Scorpion is so famous.

81
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,190
But this hideout

82
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,390
is too shabby.

83
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:47,340
We run a small business.

84
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:49,010
We can't compare with you guys.

85
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:50,900
You're all suited up

86
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,930
just to buy some medicine.

87
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,620
You're just like a real estate agent.

88
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,010
Mr. Scorpion,

89
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,390
the agent does not earn as much as we do.

90
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,280
This time,

91
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:05,910
we're here to talk about

92
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,240
the joint production with you.

93
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:14,660
Okay.

94
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,070
Taste my goods.

95
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,190
Mr. Scorpion,

96
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,390
this kind of stuff

97
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,430
does not impress us at all.

98
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:39,350
It didn't impress you at all,

99
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,470
but it is able to attract drug addicts.

100
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,110
Are you surprised?

101
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,890
I will process the good stuff

102
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,870
and it will be 40% more.

103
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,980
So I can earn 40% more.

104
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,100
Why should I

105
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,900
work with you guys?

106
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,680
Mr. Scorpion, as we know,

107
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,300
you can't even get the goods

108
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:07,590
into the pockets of the big distributors.

109
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,140
Nor can it enter the hot places.

110
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:13,880
You at most scatter the goods

111
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:15,380
with the help of these kids

112
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,920
and keep switching places.

113
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,420
You're so unprofessional.

114
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,640
But with both of us,

115
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,440
we can guarantee

116
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,940
you will earn twice

117
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:27,520
as much as now.

118
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,809
Mr. Scorpion, the raw materials outside

119
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,230
are a gift to you from us.

120
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,200
That means

121
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,100
you're here to join me.

122
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,680
Mr. Scorpion.

123
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,720
Isn't this welcome ceremony
a bit too much?

124
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,560
It's understandable

125
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,970
if Mu Qing came to see me.

126
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,130
Li Ruosheng, you're Mr. Ou's godson.

127
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,450
You don't have to do this.

128
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:22,790
What do you want?

129
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,190
Mr. Scorpion,

130
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,310
I'm not ashamed

131
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,630
to be here today.

132
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,310
I'm Li Ruosheng and my godson reputation

133
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,980
didn't live up to its name.

134
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,180
My godfather didn't care about me.

135
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:48,790
We worked so hard for Group K's sake.

136
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,120
But all the credit belongs
to the Four Vajras.

137
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:53,150
We risked our lives

138
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,990
for a few places on Jinhua Street.

139
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,360
He gave them all to Dakun.

140
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:59,090
Mr. Scorpion, could you endure it
if you were me?

141
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,180
I can't accept it.

142
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,700
The Xingxin area

143
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:18,970
and the development area,

144
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,170
Li Ruosheng and I got all of those.

145
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,230
And now?

146
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,810
He gave them to Congtou.

147
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,600
Honestly, it's not just Li Ruosheng,

148
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:28,920
even I can't bear it.

149
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,720
Mr. Scorpion.

150
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,830
We heard that you're righteous.

151
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,240
We want to work with you.

152
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,860
We'll handle the ingredients

153
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:42,290
and distribution if you grant it.

154
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,670
That's right, Mr. Scorpion.

155
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,170
You'll be lying on the bed

156
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,490
waiting for a lot of money

157
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:48,720
to flow into your pocket.

158
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,180
Why should I trust you?

159
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,990
The raw materials outside

160
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,260
are worth over two million.

161
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,550
Does it show our sincerity?

162
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,840
We'll check it later.

163
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,000
Hey guys, drink up.

164
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,410
Thank you.

165
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,460
Have a drink.

166
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,430
Wait a minute.

167
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:52,960
Mr. Scorpion asked us to check its purity.

168
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,670
Mr. Scorpion, it's pure.

169
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,750
I repeat.

170
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,240
Mr. Mu told us

171
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,090
not to kill anyone.

172
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,890
Got it. Put it on.

173
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,480
You, open the door.

174
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,980
You just lost.

175
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:39,950
Go.

176
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:41,570
Come on.

177
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,610
-Cheers.
-Let's go.

178
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:50,460
Get weapons.

179
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,850
Move!

180
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:15,810
Go!

181
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,130
Come on, let's go.

182
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:20,290
Hurry up. Come on.

183
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:26,590
Mr. Scorpion, let's work well together.

184
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,600
Okay.

185
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:31,470
Thank you for your trust.

186
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:38,160
[Mr. Scorpion, we're in trouble.]

187
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,440
Mr. Scorpion.

188
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,490
Nobody moves.

189
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,550
Kill him. Go!

190
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:49,950
Get up.

191
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,460
You guys are late.

192
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,620
Mr. Scorpion, you are the first to die.

193
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,890
Any last words?

194
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,650
I don't have children.

195
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,100
Are you going

196
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,350
to handle my funeral if I tell you?

197
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:32,060
I'll shoot you right now.

198
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,150
Ruosheng, he's lucky if we shoot him.

199
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,730
Let's try something else.

200
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,180
Come on.

201
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,570
There's more entertainment.

202
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,180
What do you mean?

203
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,740
It's supposed to be used for escape.

204
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,280
There's no need for that now.

205
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,910
I'll leave it to Scorpion.

206
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,280
Take him in.

207
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,430
Hold on.

208
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,510
Even if it's broken, it's still a boat.

209
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:13,720
It's a pity to use it as a coffin for him.

210
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,660
Don't bother.

211
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:35,720
I did it too hard.

212
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,530
But you didn't suffer much.

213
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,980
Don't blame me.

214
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,260
What are you waiting for?

215
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,980
Clean up.

216
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:51,870
Also, drag that boat back.

217
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,250
Let's be economical.

218
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:56,970
Mr. Li, what about him?

219
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,690
Do you want to keep him?

220
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,570
[Let me remind you.]

221
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:06,300
[Drug Enforcement Squad has been watching
Scorpion for a long time.]

222
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,020
We were supposed to end it in two days.

223
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,130
I don't care how you do it.

224
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,200
You have to leave

225
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,910
Scorpion to Bao Yunhai.

226
00:16:14,490 --> 00:16:17,740
[We're going to get more clues from him.]

227
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:39,210
Captain Bao,
search complete. No target found.

228
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,710
Go ashore.

229
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,120
Hey.

230
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,620
[Captain Bao, we found something.]

231
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,440
I bought something you like. Eat it.

232
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:29,770
Hey.

233
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,350
Don't lie to me.

234
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,680
Where were you last night?

235
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:35,050
You didn't come back.

236
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,640
You don't want to eat it?

237
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:38,790
I'll throw it away.

238
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,250
I don't care...

239
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:43,980
I got it.

240
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:46,180
You were with Li Ruosheng, right?

241
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,900
Yes, I was fooling around. What's wrong?

242
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,570
"What's wrong?"

243
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,900
What's wrong with you? You're so fierce.

244
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:00,300
What's on your sleeve?

245
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,800
Why is there blood?

246
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,120
Are you hurt?

247
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:04,400
Come here.

248
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,950
My goodness.

249
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,250
Ms. Ou.

250
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,010
I'm just a bodyguard.

251
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,810
I bump and get hurt every day.

252
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,130
It happens all the time.

253
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,500
You should eat.

254
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,900
I need to get changed and go out.

255
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:19,840
Sit down.

256
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,300
Did I tell you to get up?

257
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,110
Didn't I tell you?

258
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,690
You'll go wherever I go.

259
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:27,100
You're my bodyguard.

260
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,610
It's done. You left me alone at home.

261
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:30,970
You're out protecting others.

262
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:33,350
What if someone breaks in?

263
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,840
What if I get hurt?

264
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:36,210
What will you tell my dad?

265
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,420
Ms. Ou, I never pushed you

266
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:41,310
to choose me as your bodyguard.

267
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,720
You can switch me

268
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,210
if you have any complaints about me.

269
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,810
I won't.

270
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,750
I'm not done with you yet.

271
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:52,660
Don't go.

272
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,340
Why don't you stay at home

273
00:18:58,510 --> 00:18:59,880
with Mr. Ou

274
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:01,770
as you just returned to China?

275
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,310
It's safest to stay at home

276
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,500
with Mr. Ou.

277
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,170
You can have

278
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,580
any bodyguard you want.

279
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:09,430
Pick whoever you want.

280
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,710
I don't want to.

281
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,310
Besides, he doesn't want me to live there.

282
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,470
Why?

283
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,840
Ask him yourself.

284
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:21,040
Is there such a dad?

285
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,200
Normally, he would just ignore me.

286
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,650
I went up to him.

287
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,810
Did you see how he treats me?

288
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,960
It's like he wants me
to go far away from him.

289
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,390
I got it.

290
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:35,300
Is he doing something dirty?

291
00:19:35,650 --> 00:19:38,200
That's why he is avoiding me.

292
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,770
Why didn't you go back to France

293
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:43,310
if you don't want to stay?

294
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,550
I don't want to go back.

295
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:48,320
You won't understand me.

296
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:49,770
And you.

297
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,800
Just be a bodyguard. That's it.

298
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,870
Understand?

299
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:56,950
Okay.

300
00:19:57,830 --> 00:20:00,290
And I just want to give you a heads-up.

301
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:02,310
Switch me out whenever you want

302
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,940
if you have any complaints about me.

303
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,260
Understand?

304
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,350
No.

305
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,680
It's what you bought.

306
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:14,190
I'm changing. Don't come in.

307
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,210
What's wrong?

308
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,630
He's in a bad temper.

309
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:38,660
[You're the only one left.
Why aren't you coming?]

310
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:40,590
[Are you sure you're going back]

311
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,040
[to deliver breakfast?]

312
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,760
[Or are you under the pretense]

313
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,340
[of bringing breakfast home?]

314
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:48,030
[Did Ms. Ou say she misses you?]

315
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,100
I'm going to save

316
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:55,730
what you sent.

317
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:57,140
I'll show it to your godfather

318
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,370
some other time.

319
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,740
[Director.]

320
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,600
We have proof of Scorpion
and his drug production site.

321
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,960
If you had...

322
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,120
If you had given the order earlier,

323
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,750
it wouldn't be like this.

324
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,170
Many cases

325
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,800
are unsolved after Scorpion died.

326
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,200
We need to start over.

327
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,360
Hello, this is Liu Hanshan.

328
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,680
When is the comrade of Provincial Public
Security Bureau coming?

329
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,420
Okay, don't worry.

330
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,600
I'll handle it.

331
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,110
I understand.

332
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:51,960
You can go back now.

333
00:21:57,550 --> 00:22:00,010
Mr. Liu, I'll talk to him.

334
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,910
It was my fault
for what happened with Scorpion.

335
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:16,030
I request disciplinary action.

336
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,710
It happened on an impulse.

337
00:22:18,930 --> 00:22:20,870
It's not something you can control.

338
00:22:21,390 --> 00:22:22,710
Let's talk about it later.

339
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,560
I came today to tell you

340
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:27,070
that the Drug Task Force
of Provincial Public Security Bureau

341
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,430
sent Rong Yao to Yungang.

342
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,290
Why is he here?

343
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:33,270
Do you remember

344
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,090
the new drug I told you about last time?

345
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,160
It's possible

346
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,530
that Ou Zhenhai will take it over.

347
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,290
That's what Rong Yao is for.

348
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,710
Besides, the two of you
need to work together

349
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,390
for our future missions.

350
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:47,620
So cooperate well with him.

351
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,300
Rong Yu is his sister.

352
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:52,590
Rong Yao is very sad

353
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,880
about her sacrifice.

354
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,710
So I hope you can understand

355
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,200
if he has any personal behavior

356
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,830
upon you.

357
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,510
I also want to remind you

358
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,450
not to let your personal feelings

359
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,250
affect the mission.

360
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,500
I understand.

361
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,600
Come on.

362
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:24,050
Everyone, bottoms up.

363
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,980
Let's drink until we drop.

364
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,480
Okay.

365
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,830
Music, let's go!

366
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,460
Are you ready?

367
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:41,820
Okay.

368
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:46,750
♫ My passion grows like a fire ♫

369
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:50,450
♫ Burning up the whole desert ♫

370
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,470
♫ The sun sees me ♫

371
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,230
♫ And avoids me ♫

372
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,390
♫ It's afraid of me ♫

373
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,680
♫ The fire of love ♫

374
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,240
Why are you sitting here?

375
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:04,750
Is it boring?

376
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,560
Girls, come here.

377
00:24:08,050 --> 00:24:09,240
No, it's okay.

378
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,260
I just have a sore throat.

379
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,580
I need a drink to moisten it.

380
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,430
We worked so hard

381
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:16,410
to get such a beautiful battle done.

382
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,040
Why aren't you excited?

383
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,320
Get excited.

384
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:23,360
Ruosheng, everyone has different ways
of getting excited.

385
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:24,860
The way I get excited

386
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,400
is by spending time alone.

387
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,020
I'm already excited.

388
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,300
I'm so excited.

389
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,060
Let's go inside.

390
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,950
Come on. Cheers.

391
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,380
Turn it off.

392
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,210
Hello, go ahead and speak.

393
00:25:00,930 --> 00:25:01,900
Okay.

394
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:03,750
No problem.

395
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,300
No problem.

396
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,290
Guess what?

397
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,050
What?

398
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,720
Godfather wants to see us.

399
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,610
Really?

400
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,370
Our day to shine is coming.

401
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,140
When will we meet him?

402
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:26,370
Right now. Immediately.

403
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:32,790
But there's a big problem to be solved.

404
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:35,520
What?

405
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,060
Take Ou Kexin.

406
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,330
I'm not going.

407
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,140
No, Ms. Ou.

408
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,650
Mr. Glasses said
Godfather wanted to see you.

409
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,230
This is a task for me.

410
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,640
You're putting me

411
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,410
in a tight spot if you don't go.

412
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,910
I'm not going.

413
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:51,580
I'm not going. You hear me?

414
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,380
Didn't you see how he acted that day?

415
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,850
He told me to get lost
and go back abroad, right?

416
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:57,340
Yet he wants to see me now?

417
00:25:58,090 --> 00:25:59,320
I'm not a ball.

418
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,260
I have my pride too.

419
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:02,800
Why are you competing

420
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,380
with your dad?

421
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,710
You and Godfather are closely linked.

422
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,990
Blood is thicker than water.

423
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,710
You're a family.

424
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,960
You call him "Godfather" again and again.

425
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,240
You guys really are a family.

426
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,510
You guys sound so close.

427
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:17,270
You're just an outsider.

428
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,860
My dad doesn't pick me up personally.

429
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,090
Instead, he asks an outsider

430
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,760
when he's the one who wants to see me.

431
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,120
Is he even sincere?

432
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,930
He...

433
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,950
He could be

434
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,320
bad at expressing himself.

435
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,380
I don't care. I'm not going anyway.

436
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:33,770
Tie me up if you really want me to go.

437
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:35,880
I wouldn't dare.

438
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,790
Ms. Ou, we're all here
to discuss with you.

439
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,030
Discuss?

440
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,310
Okay.

441
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:46,180
How about you tell him this today?

442
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:49,170
I don't want to eat or sleep
these past few days.

443
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,620
Tell him how pitiful I am

444
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,210
as exaggerated as possible.

445
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,260
Why?

446
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,720
Are you stupid?

447
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,340
I'm going to break his heart.

448
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:58,720
That's how he'll feel guilty.

449
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,300
Then he'll be good to me.

450
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:03,340
I'll tie him up
with a chain of emotions and morals.

451
00:27:03,430 --> 00:27:04,970
That's how I can live well.

452
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,860
It's very logical.

453
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,220
You have a point.

454
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,460
Deal?

455
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,600
Deal.

456
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,620
Yes!

457
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,560
I'll get changed and leave.

458
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:30,440
Kexin, welcome home.

459
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,860
-Does he really want to see me?
-Yes.

460
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,880
He has been talking about you.

461
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,600
He'll cook for you today.

462
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,530
He wants to treat you well.

463
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,950
He knows he's in the wrong, right?

464
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,540
Let's see how he apologizes.

465
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,010
Say something nice after getting in.

466
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,020
I won't.

467
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,150
Mu Qing,

468
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,130
go to the second floor
once you get inside.

469
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,060
Mr. Ou is waiting for you in the study.

470
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,470
What about me?

471
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:00,890
You know that Mr. Ou loves fish.

472
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,830
He asked you to go
to the pond in the backyard.

473
00:28:02,910 --> 00:28:04,150
Catch a fish and kill it.

474
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:05,200
All right.

475
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,410
Why does Godfather ask me to kill a fish?

476
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,630
Do you not know how or you are scared?

477
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,090
I don't know how.

478
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,060
I am scared, mostly.

479
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:28,260
You even killed Scorpion,

480
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,840
but you're scared to kill the fish?

481
00:28:29,930 --> 00:28:31,070
That's not the same.

482
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,410
Poor little fish.

483
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,900
How can I kill a fish?

484
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,150
Then learn.

485
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:39,610
Remember,
don't burst the fish's gallbladder.

486
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,000
Otherwise, it'll taste bitter, Chef.

487
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:46,740
Where is the gallbladder?

488
00:29:01,870 --> 00:29:02,750
Come in.

489
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:07,420
Mr. Ou.

490
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,540
I haven't touched a knife in years.

491
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:11,640
I'm so clumsy.

492
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:13,450
I have to cook for everyone today.

493
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,900
Help me with it.

494
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:23,390
"Food Lists of the Garden of Contentment."

495
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,100
It was written by Yuan Mei.

496
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,830
Ancients know how to enjoy food.

497
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,740
Only a few items are needed

498
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:32,940
and it can create many different flavors

499
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,960
by a variety of different combinations.

500
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,040
It's way better compared to the fancy ways

501
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,890
of cooking nowadays.

502
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:42,840
Cooking food

503
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,420
is like mixing Chinese medicine.

504
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,370
It's all about hierarchy
in Chinese medicine.

505
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:51,020
Ingredients and spices
should be prioritized.

506
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,060
It's not good if the seasoning

507
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,260
is too strong to cover the taste

508
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,590
of the ingredients.

509
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,210
You're talking about Ruosheng and me.

510
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:06,460
It's not just you.

511
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,620
It's the whole group.

512
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,350
Do you know why I want to meet you alone?

513
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:18,390
Because of Scorpion.

514
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:22,000
That small scorpion is not enough

515
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,580
to bring you in front of me.

516
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:26,400
There are all kinds of ingredients

517
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,200
mixed up together

518
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,780
in our group.

519
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,560
Hierarchy and priority are not cleared.

520
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,150
I'm trying to add something to it

521
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:37,090
to change the taste.

522
00:30:39,330 --> 00:30:40,480
I understand,

523
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:42,720
Sir.

524
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:46,200
Aren't you afraid of losing more for less?

525
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:52,490
What's less and what's more?

526
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,650
Jealousy is less.

527
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,370
Business is more.

528
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:04,940
You're quite interesting.

529
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,990
There's nothing wrong with your base.

530
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:11,140
You're honest and dedicated

531
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,900
after following Ruosheng.

532
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,180
It's not a problem.

533
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:16,770
But one thing I don't understand.

534
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,190
Why did you come here

535
00:31:19,850 --> 00:31:21,390
when you had such skills?

536
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,810
And you follow a kid like Ruosheng.

537
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:28,610
Of course, it's for getting to the top.

538
00:31:36,130 --> 00:31:37,540
You're so straightforward.

539
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,040
It's just not as complicated

540
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:40,580
as you thought.

541
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,110
Okay.

542
00:31:45,810 --> 00:31:47,570
Have you ever thought about this?

543
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:51,400
You can't go back once you enter.

544
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,720
After coming in,

545
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,190
black cannot be white.

546
00:31:55,930 --> 00:32:00,640
The white can't be mixed up in black.

547
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,480
I'm sure you're aware.

548
00:32:06,410 --> 00:32:08,030
I was neither black nor white

549
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:09,970
before I met Ruosheng.

550
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,050
During those hard times,

551
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,560
I deeply feel like there's no middle zone

552
00:32:15,910 --> 00:32:17,360
between black and white.

553
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:21,760
I'm certainly not white again
since I chose black.

554
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:24,750
However, from your standpoint,

555
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:27,570
how dare I fish in troubled waters

556
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,800
under your eyes?

557
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,210
Okay.

558
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,290
I want to see you

559
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,800
because I don't want you

560
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,780
to fish in troubled waters anymore.

561
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,300
I want you to come to me

562
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,630
into this cauldron.

563
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,420
But there'll be a competition
with the contents in it

564
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,840
after you add in the spice.

565
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,880
It all depends on your own instincts

566
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:55,770
whether you will get absorbed

567
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,310
by the ingredients,

568
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,720
or you can bring out

569
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,790
the original flavor of the ingredients.

570
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:05,630
As a cook, I can only throw you in.

571
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:06,820
I can't help you.

572
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:13,680
Yes, sir.

573
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:16,410
Ruosheng and I will do our best.

574
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,460
You're calmer and braver than Ruosheng.

575
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,670
I'll need you to help him in the future.

576
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,480
Let's go down and eat.

577
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:28,990
Yes, sir.

578
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,620
What did Godfather tell you?

579
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,220
About cooking.

580
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,680
-Cooking?
-Yes.

581
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,350
You guys discuss about cooking?

582
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,080
Let's talk later.

583
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:52,970
I can't talk here.

584
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,690
You've changed.

585
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,710
How have I changed?

586
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,810
You did.

587
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,350
No, I didn't.

588
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,540
How can I talk here?

589
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:01,860
What are you talking about?

590
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,650
Just business stuff.

591
00:34:06,790 --> 00:34:07,840
Ruosheng.

592
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:08,900
Yes.

593
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:09,949
Help me.

594
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,100
I'm coming.

595
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,830
You did.

596
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,360
It's always about business.

597
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:21,000
You're just being abused too much
by my dad.

598
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,580
You don't even know about life.

599
00:34:24,739 --> 00:34:27,030
Come here. Give me some soup.

600
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:35,030
Your dad didn't abuse me that much.

601
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,889
But you're treating me like a waiter.

602
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,370
How could I not use my authority?

603
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,510
Here.

604
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:46,080
Your dad is busy in the kitchen.

605
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:47,750
It's rude to eat first.

606
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,600
It won't taste good if it gets cold.

607
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,960
Who cares?

608
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,409
I'll do it myself.

609
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,760
Mr. Ou will be here soon.

610
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,120
Talk to him nicely.

611
00:34:57,210 --> 00:34:58,400
Don't talk back to him.

612
00:34:58,490 --> 00:35:00,600
Why should I listen to you, my bodyguard?

613
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,720
I'll do as you say

614
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,130
if you become my boyfriend.

615
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,710
Here you go.

616
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,430
Have a year of prosperity!

617
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,160
Here. Put it here. Give it to Kexin.

618
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:12,740
Sit down and eat.

619
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,360
I don't eat fish. I'm allergic.

620
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,080
Goodness.

621
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,190
How could I forget this?

622
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,530
It's okay. I'll eat the fish.

623
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,130
But I like the soup.

624
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:28,890
I'll get you one.

625
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,070
What's going on?

626
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,780
You kicked me out last time.

627
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:37,780
And now, you cooked so many dishes for me.

628
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,910
What's wrong?

629
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,730
Who killed the fish today?

630
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,930
Godfather, I killed it.

631
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,180
Did you break the fish's gallbladder?

632
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:53,350
You don't know how to kill fish?

633
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,270
Do you still resent me?

634
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,040
I would be lying

635
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,410
if I said I don't blame you.

636
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,700
But it's much better now.

637
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,290
How's Ruosheng's place?

638
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,200
There's no place like home.

639
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,450
I wish I could see you at home every day.

640
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,300
But you have to understand me.

641
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:20,240
I'm in a difficult situation. Okay?

642
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,300
I understand.

643
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,500
Still, you have to tell me the truth.

644
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,260
What?

645
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,730
What exactly do you do?

646
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,270
Why are you so secretive?

647
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,380
I can't even go home because of you.

648
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,460
Are you in national intelligence?

649
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:44,960
Intelligence?

650
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,120
Just remember.

651
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:50,020
No matter what I do, it's all for you.

652
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,840
Don't ask about what I do.

653
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,560
I know that.

654
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,110
I heard you spent Ruosheng's
hundreds of thousands of dollars.

655
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,250
Is that so?

656
00:36:58,430 --> 00:36:59,880
So they're tattling to you.

657
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,330
They're so petty.

658
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,710
Don't be too over the top.

659
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,910
They may look rich,

660
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,670
but it's not easy to make money.

661
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,340
It's not easy to live outside

662
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,440
as a girl either.

663
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,670
I need money, right?

664
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,090
Instead of asking me not to bully them,

665
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,980
why don't you make it simple?

666
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,350
Let me come back.

667
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,690
Once I'm almost done with my business,

668
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,020
I'll bring you back home.

669
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:26,850
But now, you have to stay away.

670
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,950
What are you doing?

671
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,600
Do you want me to go back again?

672
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,010
You've had enough fun

673
00:37:40,090 --> 00:37:41,550
and had a reunion dinner.

674
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,350
I'll ask Mr. Glasses

675
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,670
to prepare money for you.

676
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,860
Go back to France first.

677
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:48,500
Then you can go
to Europe or North America for fun.

678
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,480
I can't go anywhere for fun

679
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:52,190
if I really go back.

680
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,170
Why?

681
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:56,810
The only place I can go

682
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,440
is either court or prison

683
00:37:58,970 --> 00:38:01,570
as soon as I return to France.

684
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,000
What do you mean?

685
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,810
Two days before I came back,

686
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:10,010
there was a fire
on the outskirts of France.

687
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,730
Look it up yourself

688
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,360
if you really want to know.

689
00:38:15,290 --> 00:38:16,750
Godfather really said that?

690
00:38:16,830 --> 00:38:17,850
Of course.

691
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:21,540
That's great.

692
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:23,570
We're officially joining

693
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:25,630
the group's core today.

694
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,100
Soon I'll be equal with the Four Vajras.

695
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:30,740
Congratulations.

696
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:32,150
You finally got what you wanted.

697
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,870
Thank you.

698
00:38:35,530 --> 00:38:37,820
Fine, I'll go. What's the big deal?

699
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,330
Who is wrong in the end?

700
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,700
It's all an act.

701
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:44,160
There you go again.

702
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,800
See for yourself.

703
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,590
He's asking you to go back.

704
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,280
I don't need you to tell me again.

705
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,710
Help me think of something.

706
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,400
Give me a reason.

707
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,770
I'm the daughter of your boss.

708
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:08,530
You're leaving.

709
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:10,340
I don't think it's a good reason.

710
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,890
I let you meet my dad.

711
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,470
Why can't you help me?

712
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,110
It's not that I don't want to.

713
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,740
It's that I can't even help you.

714
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:22,790
Everyone knows Mr. Ou
never goes back on his word.

715
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,110
What can I do?

716
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:26,400
I got it. You think I'm annoying.

717
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,580
You can get rid of me

718
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,860
by taking this opportunity.

719
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,240
What if I say,

720
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:37,880
"Yes"?

721
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,150
You're ungrateful.

722
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:44,790
Kexin.

723
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,420
-Kexin.
-Let go of me.

724
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,440
Kexin. Stop it, Kexin.

725
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,020
What's the matter?

726
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:52,000
He told me to go back to jail, right?

727
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,820
I want to stay in China.

728
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:56,620
Stay by his side.

729
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,690
Is it that hard?

730
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,960
Kexin, your dad does not know anything.

731
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,280
Please understand him.

732
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,700
He said to put it on hold.

733
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,130
Give me back the ticket.

734
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,850
Here you go.

735
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,530
What is it?

736
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,160
This is the living expense that he

737
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:21,880
wants to give you while you're in China.

738
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:23,860
Take it.

739
00:40:25,570 --> 00:40:27,110
-Here, take this.
-Go back and tell him.

740
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,130
I can live well

741
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,310
without his stinking money.

742
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:37,320
Mu Qing, take this money.

743
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,400
Take care of Kexin these days.

744
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,380
Mr. Glasses,

745
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,670
what about our business

746
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,300
if we take care of her?

747
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,100
That's what Mr. Ou wants.

748
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:52,810
Take it.

749
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,120
Why should I give the money to you?

750
00:40:57,870 --> 00:40:58,930
Open the door.

751
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,450
Mr. Glasses.

752
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,990
Tell this to Mr. Ou.

753
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,750
We'll take good care of Kexin.

754
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:11,600
Go.

755
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:38,610
