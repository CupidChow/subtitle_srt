really drew his gun.

153

In my opinion,

154
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,560
he's just a kid,

155
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,060
yet he tried to go against you?

156
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:26,040
He doesn't stand a chance.

157
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,340
He's just an idiot

158
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,660
who has no chance of winning.

159
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,090
Mr. Ou assigned him to me.

160
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,630
Could it be

161
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,210
that Mr. Ou doesn't trust you?

162
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,200
It's not that he doesn't trust me.

163
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,150
Spectre will come to Yungang soon.

Three out of the Four Vajras have fallen.

165

He hopes

166
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,410
that someone can put up a facade.

167
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,790
He doesn't have the right to do that.

168
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,150
What happened today

169
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,960
was just to teach him a lesson.

170
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,190
Spectre is coming.

171
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:03,790
At a time like this,

172
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,720
who can make things happen

173
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:06,960
and who can mess things up,

174
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,040
I'm sure Mr. Ou knows.

175
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:13,510
What was I thinking at the time?

176
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,270
I suddenly drew my gun.

177
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,990
I offended a few old men.

178
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,410
Godfather called just now

179
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,820
and scolded me.

180
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,580
He asked me to apologize to Xu.

181
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:24,420
How should I apologize?

182
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,280
Let me tell you.

183
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,830
You fell for Mr. Glasses's trick.

184
00:10:31,510 --> 00:10:32,390
What do you mean?

185
00:10:33,930 --> 00:10:35,160
Did you arrive on time today?

186
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,260
The meeting was at 6 p.m.

187
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:37,310
I arrived at 5:50 p.m.

188
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:38,550
When you got there,

189
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,170
did they already have one round?

190
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,560
I guess they were almost done.

191
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,990
You came last and you're the junior.

192
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:48,670
I'm sure Mr. Glasses

193
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,250
would introduce you to everyone.

194
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:52,140
But the way he talked

195
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,680
would make everyone feel like

196
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:55,000
you're his subordinate.

197
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,890
They won't take you seriously.

198
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,790
Besides,

199
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:01,070
Mr. Glasses knows you're impatient.

200
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,980
Xu must have used it to humiliate you

201
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,250
and embarrass you in public.

202
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,150
He can checkmate you in front of my dad.

203
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,780
Actually, I thought the same thing too.

204
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,270
But now that you mention it,

205
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,650
it proves that I was right.

206
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,040
How did you survive?

207
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,900
In the past, the fight between adults

208
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,130
are all handled by Mu Qing.

209
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,240
Isn't he gone now?

210
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:27,780
I've searched the entire Yungang,

211
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,970
but I still can't find him.

212
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,460
If he doesn't come back now,

213
00:11:30,550 --> 00:11:31,610
this will be big trouble.

214
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:37,860
What are you doing?

215
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,580
Hey!

216
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:46,300
I spent half a day folding them.

217
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,760
No, I can't go.

218
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,080
If I leave now,

219
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,400
I don't know where Mu Qing is.

220
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,460
I'll never get to see him again.

221
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:53,700
It's not that serious.

222
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,710
You have to help me.

223
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:55,850
How can I help you?

224
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,170
Help me stay.

225
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,140
Am I crazy?

226
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,810
If I help you stay,

227
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,670
will Godfather still keep me?

228
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,140
How could you watch me

229
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,320
and Mu Qing get torn apart?

230
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,600
Are you my friend?

231
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,500
If I can make Xu continue

232
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,600
to move the goods,

233
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,050
you'll do well in front of my dad.

234
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,500
Then he'll stop being mad at you.

235
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,470
Will you help me?

236
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,440
Who?

237
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,150
You want to help me?

238
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,530
Forget it.

239
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,820
How would you know if you don't try?

240
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,360
Tell me exactly what happened.

241
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:29,910
Come on.

242
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,400
Mr. Xu.

243
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,850
I heard you're a Northeasterner.

244
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:52,520
You haven't returned in years, right?

245
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,290
So you're Mr. Ou's daughter.

246
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:56,530
Yes.

247
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,680
I heard a lot about you from my dad.

248
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,410
Miss, that's nonsense.

249
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,960
Your dad doesn't even know me.

250
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,450
Mr. Xu, how can you say that?

251
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,520
You've been here for so many years

252
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:11,570
and you're also a tycoon.

253
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,850
You're forthright.

254
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,740
Even if my dad didn't mention you,

255
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,410
who would not know you?

256
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,220
Am I right?

257
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:25,170
Mr. Xu.

258
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,850
I was too impulsive yesterday.

259
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,220
I'll drink as punishment.

260
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:39,560
Ms. Ou.

261
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,240
I'm just trying to save your reputation.

262
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,820
That was why I agreed to meet you.

263
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,740
I've been in the industry for decades.

264
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,810
I had never seen anyone

265
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,540
dares to draw their gun in front of me.

266
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,770
I can't let him get away with that easily.

267
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:00,680
Of course you can't.

268
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,300
Mr. Xu, don't worry.

269
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,980
I won't let it slide.

270
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,470
Last night,

271
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,670
my dad has relieved him of his post.

272
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,900
Mr. Xu, from today onward,

273
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,920
I'll deal with everything.

274
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,570
How about this?

275
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:20,740
From now on, with every delivery,

276
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,160
I'll give you an extra 2%.

277
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,480
An extra 2%?

278
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,840
That's too little.

279
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,820
I'll give you 4%.

280
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,470
That's my maximum.

281
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,050
You're a woman.

282
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,520
Can you be in charge?

283
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,070
Of course I can.

284
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,890
Mr. Xu, what's wrong with being a woman?

285
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,750
Are you looking down on me?

286
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,710
All right.

287
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,420
I've always heard

288
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,920
Northeastern ladies are forthright.

289
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:59,060
How about this?

290
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,730
"When in Rome, do as the Romans do."

291
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,150
I'll empty the glass.

292
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,460
I'm afraid you won't like this one.

293
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,400
Mr. Xu, I'm sorry.

294
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,350
Mr. Xu.

295
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,760
What do you think?

296
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,870
"A wise goose never lays a tame egg."

297
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,580
I finally understand the strength

298
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:51,600
of the Ou family today.

299
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,310
So be it, 4% it is.

300
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:55,470
I'll arrange a shipment for you
this afternoon.

301
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,710
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

302
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,870
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

303
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:02,730
Why did you do that?

304
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,780
That was too fierce.

305
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:05,240
Nobody drinks like that.

306
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:06,910
Here, let me help you.

307
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,250
It stinks.

308
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,680
I did it for you, didn't I?

309
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,000
How was my performance?

310
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,450
It was great.

311
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,520
Okay then.

312
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,810
Mr. Xu is taken care of.

313
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,100
You still have Glasses.

314
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,620
Do you remember everything I taught you?

315
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:35,110
I remember.

316
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:37,840
It all depends on you now.

317
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:49,320
Xu agreed?

318
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,180
When did it happen?

319
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,170
This afternoon.

320
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,890
I went to see Mr. Xu.

321
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,860
He promised me.

322
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,970
But in return,

323
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,330
I have to give him an extra 4%.

324
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:03,890
An extra 4%?

325
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,310
Are you crazy?

326
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,730
How could you decide this on your own?

327
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:10,180
Believe it or not,

328
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,030
I'll report this to Mr. Ou now.

329
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,260
It's okay, Mr. Glasses.

330
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:15,810
I've reported it to my godfather.

331
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,589
Are you saying

332
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,880
that Mr. Glasses is pocketing 4%

333
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:23,730
from Xu's delivery fee

334
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:24,920
behind my dad's back?

335
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:26,109
That's right.

336
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,819
This 4%.

337
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:30,150
Mu Qing discovered it before he left.

338
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,000
He said it was a small issue

339
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:33,500
and even if we had told Godfather,

340
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,860
we couldn't crush Glasses.

341
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,190
Even if we can't crush him,

342
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:38,600
let's scare him to death.

343
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,200
What should I tell Glasses then?

344
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,920
Just say...

345
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,200
When Mr. Dakun was here,

346
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,660
Li helped us with transportation.

347
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,990
Godfather gave him 7%.

348
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,190
After you took over Dakun's business,

349
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,420
you found Xu.

350
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,580
But you only gave him 3%.

351
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,730
Is that true?

352
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:04,080
I'm trying to save our group some money.

353
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,720
You did save money.

354
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:08,960
But where's the money you saved?

355
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,730
I heard from Godfather

356
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,550
that you gave Xu 7% too.

357
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:16,000
Am I right?

358
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,460
Godfather told me to do business with you

359
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,660
because there's no one else he can use.

360
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:24,800
He only sent me there

361
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:25,810
to make us look good.

362
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,570
But in this business,

363
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,380
you're in charge, Mr. Glasses.

364
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,120
All these things are behind the scenes.

365
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,230
On the surface,

366
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,520
we have to get along.

367
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,720
Once we have a united front,

368
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,480
the outsiders won't laugh at us.

369
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,390
So despite our differences,

370
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,330
at this moment,

371
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,310
it's better to back off.

372
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,020
Otherwise,

373
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:53,570
it means you're picking on my godfather.

374
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:55,950
What do you think, Mr. Glasses?

375
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,930
We haven't seen each other for a day.

376
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,750
I see you've improved.

377
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,200
You flatter me, Mr. Glasses.

378
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,690
In the past two years,

379
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,840
I've learned a lot

380
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,860
from you, Mr. Glasses.

381
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,550
Okay.

382
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:22,790
As you wish,

383
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:26,310
I'll give you a hand.

384
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,690
That's good.

385
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,770
Thank you for the tea, Mr. Glasses.

386
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,610
I'm off, Mr. Glasses.

387
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,150
You don't have to see me out.

388
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:51,650
How did he become so smart?

389
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,300
Someone must have given him a tip.

390
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,110
A tip?

391
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,530
Have Mu Qing come back?

392
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:11,100
Hello.

393
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,120
Xu.

394
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,370
What's wrong with you?

395
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,510
You...

396
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:19,110
What?

397
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,920
Kexin went to talk to you?

398
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,720
Okay, I understand.

399
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:31,030
Ms. Ou?

400
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,010
Why did Ms. Ou help him?

401
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,850
Find out where Kexin is.

402
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:40,010
I'll ask her in person.

403
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,150
Yes.

404
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,440
That's great.

405
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:55,800
You can still eat.

406
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,440
I've been drinking all day

407
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,890
and I didn't have anything to eat.

408
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,610
Don't talk about me.

409
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,330
You vomited so horribly just now.

410
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,600
Now, you can still drink.

411
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,710
Don't you know soul-returning alcohol?

412
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,080
I dealt with Glasses for you.

413
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,150
Don't forget what you promised me.

414
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,140
You have to help me stay here.

415
00:21:18,990 --> 00:21:20,050
Well, I...

416
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:23,390
Are you going back on your word?

417
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,730
I'm not saying I won't do it.

418
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,020
I'm just thinking.

419
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,570
How should I tell my godfather?

420
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,430
The walls have ears, right?

421
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:35,800
If you stay in the studio,

422
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,160
he'll find out sooner or later.

423
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,280
Isn't Mu Qing's apartment empty now?

424
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,090
I can move there.

425
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,870
No matter how resourceful my dad is,

426
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,020
he wouldn't think that I'd be there.

427
00:21:58,630 --> 00:21:59,820
Why are you staring at me?

428
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,580
How similar.

429
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,090
What's similar?

430
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,290
Similar to Mu Qing.

431
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:09,320
The idea you come up with.

432
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,490
That feeling is exactly the same.

433
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,090
Time flies so fast.

434
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,480
When I first met you outside the station,

435
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:23,710
you cried and shouted.

436
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,740
You looked like a little girl.

437
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,160
It hasn't been long.

438
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,700
You're so mature now.

439
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,150
You're so smart.

440
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,700
Between a man and a woman in love,

441
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,770
even IQ is contagious.

442
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:45,760
I wonder how Mu Qing is now.

443
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,490
He'll be fine.

444
00:22:56,230 --> 00:22:57,590
I also think he'll be fine.

445
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,360
It will be okay.

446
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,630
Come on.

447
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,010
Let's drink to Mu Qing.

448
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,770
You haven't heard from Mu Qing yet?

449
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:21,660
No.

450
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,020
But I'm still looking for him.

451
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,050
That means you haven't found him.

452
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,160
Whether he's dead or alive,

453
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,260
we have to find him.

454
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,190
He knows too much about the group.

455
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,380
I understand.

456
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,550
How are you?

457
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,450
Are things okay with Ruosheng?

458
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:39,650
We're fine now.

459
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:42,950
I'll handle my relationship with Ruosheng.

460
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,920
Don't worry.

461
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,510
Okay.

462
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,140
You helped me to stay behind.

463
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,240
I owe you one this time.

464
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:54,000
Don't say that.

465
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,500
Don't tell anyone that I'm here.

466
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,400
Don't worry.

467
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,710
Ou Kexin is moving

468
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,160
into Li Ruosheng's house?

469
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,330
But as far as I remember,

470
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:25,460
Mu Qing's house is across Li Ruosheng's.

471
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,500
Ou Kexin and Mu Qing are a couple.

472
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,580
Mu Qing's house is across Li Ruosheng's.

473
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,640
Could it be that Mu Qing is back?

474
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,070
Or he didn't leave at all.

475
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:45,560
Mr. Glasses.

476
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:48,030
Should we rush in and take a look?

477
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,390
Don't be impulsive.

478
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,990
Keep an eye on them.

479
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,480
I'll be right there.

480
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,630
Yes.

481
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:20,540
Why is the password different?

482
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,770
I changed it.

483
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,050
I'm afraid it's not safe.

484
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,040
This is a backup card.

485
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,630
Set it yourself later.

486
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,180
You should go in first.

487
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,190
I need to go out.

488
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,470
Call me if you need anything.

489
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,480
Okay.

490
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,400
Mu Qing.

491
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,800
Why did you come back?

492
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,480
Don't you know how you trick me to leave?

493
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:08,760
I did it for your own good.

494
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,520
Your work is done.

495
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,490
Why did you come back?

496
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,820
You can't do this alone.

497
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,010
You need me.

498
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,900
From now on,

499
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,220
I'm officially back.

500
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:21,440
My mission is to help you replace Glasses,

501
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:23,550
seize the group's core power,

502
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,600
and catch Spectre.

503
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,670
Did the bureau agree to this?

504
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,900
Director Liu hasn't agreed?

505
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,790
[I don't know if he agreed or not.]

506
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:35,160
[I only gave him your proposal]

507
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,750
[as my own proposal.]

508
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:40,800
[In the end, it's up to him to decide.]

509
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,830
Okay, I get it.

510
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,160
[I've been thinking.]

511
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,180
[If Director Liu doesn't ease off,]

512
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:52,190
[what should I do?]

513
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,880
[Does Spectre's case]

514
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,460
[have nothing to do with me anymore?]

515
00:26:58,130 --> 00:27:00,900
[My well-designed plan to drive a wedge
between them will fall apart.]

516
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,980
[Ou Kexin is facing Group K on her own.]

517
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,080
[Will she be in danger?]

518
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,410
[The more I think about it,]

519
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,770
[the more flustered I get.]

520
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,490
[Director Liu agreed.]

521
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:30,160
He wants me to help you

522
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,220
get back into Group K.

523
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,560
Thank Director Liu for me.

524
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,930
Don't celebrate just yet.

525
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,790
Group K is looking for you.

526
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,070
Going back at a time like this

527
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,920
will make you look more suspicious.

528
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,640
Under high pressure,

529
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:46,710
if you make the slightest mistake,

530
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,720
it can be quite fatal.

531
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,520
It not only threatens

532
00:27:49,610 --> 00:27:50,840
our operation to catch Spectre,

533
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,220
but it also threatens Skylark's safety.

534
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:56,340
If you go back to Group K,

535
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,670
you'll face a more complex

536
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:00,480
and dangerous situation.

537
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,410
Are you capable of handling it,

538
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,510
completing the mission,

539
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,420
and protecting Skylark?

540
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,530
Of course I'm capable.

541
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:10,330
Don't worry.

542
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,930
I won't let Skylark be in any danger.

543
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:14,860
Okay.

544
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,360
I believe you.

545
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,540
That was what happened.

546
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:22,480
Director Wang and Director Liu agreed

547
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,620
to let me help you.

548
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:25,510
Also,

549
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,550
I know everything now.

550
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:33,340
What do you know?

551
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,350
You're not Ou Kexin.

552
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,230
I have one more thing to tell you.

553
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:46,460
Skylark isn't the real Ou Kexin.

554
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,560
Skylark isn't the real Ou Kexin?

555
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,200
Then who is she?

556
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:55,740
The real Ou Kexin

557
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:59,660
died three years ago in Matsumoto's hands.

558
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:01,940
The current Ou Kexin

559
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,530
is just like you and me.

560
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,830
She's just a civilian police officer

561
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,300
affiliated to the Drug Task Force
of Provincial Public Security Bureau.

562
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,530
She's my subordinate.

563
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,320
I turned her into Skylark.

564
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,710
As for her real name,

565
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:20,730
I'm sorry.

566
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:23,370
I can't tell you yet.

567
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,930
Director Wang,
you're not telling me everything.

568
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,930
It's the rules. I know.

569
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,830
You're not Mr. Ou's real daughter.

570
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:34,630
You're my comrade.

571
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,450
To be honest,

572
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:39,250
I had been wondering the same thing.

573
00:29:39,650 --> 00:29:40,750
Why would Mr. Ou's

574
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,850
beloved adopted daughter

575
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,010
try so hard to help us?

576
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,970
Even if Mr. Ou did terrible things,

577
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,680
but he still raised you.

578
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,220
You wouldn't have come this far.

579
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,090
Of course.

580
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,120
If I'm not your comrade,

581
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,660
who else could I be?

582
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:02,490
Anyway,

583
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,130
thank you for coming back to help me.

584
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,070
Since you're thankful,

585
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,780
don't trick me into leaving again.

586
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,520
Kexin.

587
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,240
It's me, Mr. Glasses.

588
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,860
Are you in there?

589
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,480
Kexin.

590
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,000
Open the door.

591
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,000
I want to talk to you.

592
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:43,270
What should I do?

593
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:45,300
Get the door.

594
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:46,260
I can't.

595
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,500
They are after you.

596
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:49,040
Kexin.

597
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,840
I know you're in there.

598
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,600
Open the door.

599
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,840
If you don't open it,

600
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,920
I will have to find another way.

601
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,390
Listen to me. Open the door.

602
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:16,800
Mr. Glasses.

603
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:19,040
Why are you here so late at night?

604
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,320
You brought so many men.

605
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,770
Where is Mu Qing?

606
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,450
Mu Qing?

607
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,230
He has been gone for days.

608
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,590
I'm looking for him too.

609
00:31:28,850 --> 00:31:30,170
Why would he be here?

610
00:31:31,410 --> 00:31:32,680
I saw him come inside.

611
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,790
You'd better give him to me.

612
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,200
Otherwise,

613
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,530
neither you nor I will survive this.

614
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,900
It's so late.

615
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,220
You brought so many people here.

616
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:43,290
Aren't you afraid
I'll come after you first?

617
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,220
Please move aside.

618
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,030
You can't go in.

619
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,400
You can't enter!

620
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,720
Do you hear me?

621
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,350
Stop right there!

622
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:55,960
Don't you dare move forward.

623
00:31:58,110 --> 00:31:59,040
Kexin.

624
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,710
I just want to find Mu Qing.

625
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,290
I don't want any trouble.

626
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,050
Please understand.

627
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,590
Search the place!

628
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,670
You can't enter!

629
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:55,880
Mr. Glasses!

630
00:33:58,050 --> 00:33:59,070
How is it?

631
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,270
Did you find the person
you were looking for?

632
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,350
Aren't you afraid that I'll go back

633
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:06,150
and tell my dad what happened today?

634
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:08,610
It doesn't matter if he knows or not.

635
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,050
Let me tell you something, Kexin.

636
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,510
You used your dad's name

637
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,969
to do business behind his back.

638
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,040
Aren't you afraid he'll find out

639
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,540
and think differently of you?

640
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,480
What he thinks is his business.

641
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,330
It has nothing to do with you.

642
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,500
Besides, this is my family matter.

643
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:34,620
Aren't you afraid that

644
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,210
I'll tell my dad all those things you did?

645
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:41,170
Xu's matter is just a warning.

646
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:42,620
I'm telling you.

647
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,210
Don't try to harm Li Ruosheng

648
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,659
by pulling a trick behind his back.

649
00:34:46,139 --> 00:34:47,820
Or I'll get you in big trouble.

650
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:52,520
That's all I have to say.

651
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:54,370
It's late.

652
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,960
Please leave if there's nothing else.

653
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,650
Give us some privacy.

654
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,800
Yes.

655
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,330
Kexin.

656
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:13,730
You seem to be mistaken about me.

657
00:35:13,950 --> 00:35:16,590
Okay. I'll take your advice.

658
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,480
I'll be careful from now on.

659
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,200
Please leave.

660
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,520
Hold on.

661
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:48,840
Kexin.

662
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:52,980
I was a bit impulsive tonight.

663
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,000
Let's assume

664
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:56,410
nothing happened tonight, okay?

665
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,400
Good night.

666
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,240
Mu Qing.

667
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:35,260
Mu Qing.

668
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,170
Mr. Glasses.

669
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,150
Did we make a mistake?

670
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,740
Mr. Glasses.

671
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,760
Mu Qing went away.

672
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:11,690
But here comes Ou Kexin.

673
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,340
Previously, Mu Qing
was helping Li Ruosheng.

674
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:19,040
Now, Kexin is helping Li Ruosheng.

675
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,230
Shao Nan.

676
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,590
Listen.

677
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,620
Keep an eye on Ou Kexin

678
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:28,890
for the next few days.

679
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,960
See if she makes any moves.

680
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:32,370
Yes.

681
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,920
Should we report to Mr. Ou

682
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,370
that Li Ruosheng dragged Ou Kexin

683
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,650
into our group's affairs?

684
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,720
Isn't this a good opportunity

685
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:40,860
to take down Li Ruosheng?

686
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,760
On a regular day, it's a good opportunity.

687
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,120
But now,

688
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,810
Spectre will come to Yungang soon.

689
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:53,530
Mr. Ou wants peace and stability.

690
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,310
If I tell on them now,

691
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,680
what would Mr. Ou think of me?

692
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:02,470
But the matter regarding Ou Kexin

693
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,060
will get exposed one day.

694
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,260
Even if we don't talk about it,

695
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,250
Mr. Ou will find out sooner or later.

696
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:22,310
Not bad at all.

697
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,600
The sales are going up.

698
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,880
You two working together

699
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:28,380
is a good thing, right?

700
00:38:29,790 --> 00:38:30,670
Godfather.

701
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,480
Actually, I'm not good enough.

702
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,730
It's mainly due to Mr. Glasses.

703
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,400
He launched a new sales route.

704
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:39,730
The police couldn't smell anything.

705
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,230
Compared to Mr. Glasses,

706
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:43,650
I'm nowhere as good as him.

707
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,410
You're being modest.

708
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,480
After learning from Mr. Glasses

709
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,440
for a few days,

710
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:49,720
even your personality changed.

711
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:53,330
Sir, Ruosheng flatters me.

712
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,690
If Ruosheng

713
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,980
didn't reestablish the dark web

714
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,650
and got our new regulars back,

715
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:00,060
even if we have the goods,

716
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,470
we couldn't have distributed them.

717
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,540
That's enough. You two are too modest.

718
00:39:04,110 --> 00:39:05,300
This proves one thing.

719
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,570
You two working together

720
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,800
is definitely a good thing.

721
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:08,820
Am I right?

722
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,250
Glasses.

723
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,270
I have something to say to Ruosheng.

724
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:15,550
Why don't you leave first?

725
00:39:16,210 --> 00:39:17,090
Yes.

726
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,700
Where did you send Ou Kexin to?

727
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,730
Costa Rica.

728
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,540
Why hasn't she sent me a single text?

729
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,070
She hasn't been in contact with any of us.

730
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,170
Look, Godfather.

731
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,290
This is her WeChat Moments.

732
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:42,870
It's by the sea.

733
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:44,370
Tourist pictures.

734
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:46,040
She's probably having fun, eating,

735
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,180
and touring every day.

736
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:48,190
So she forgot about us.

737
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:50,920
Let her have fun.

738
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,990
It's better to have fun than to stay here.

739
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,370
But now that she's gone,

740
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,860
my heart feels empty.

741
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,060
I didn't see her for decades back then.

742
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:00,430
But I didn't miss her as much.

743
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:01,750
That's strange.

744
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:03,810
I'll call her and ask her to come back.

745
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,590
She has to come back.

746
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,080
But not now.

747
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:18,640
You're good.

748
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,620
You can pretend

749
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:22,070
to be so many Group K's buyers.

750
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,610
It's all thanks to Li Ruosheng

751
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:25,200
for reconnecting the dark web.

752
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,540
But I left three backdoors previously.

753
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:30,040
He didn't look into them at all.

754
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:32,590
Captain Rong.

755
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,260
Should we bring up the file

756
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,270
and catch all of them?

757
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,470
Now isn't the time.

758
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,580
Everyone.

759
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,080
I have big news.

760
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,660
Next month,

761
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,820
Spectre is coming to Yungang.

762
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,460
The operation that we prepared for

763
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:48,560
will then begin.

764
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,330
We can finally begin.

765
00:40:53,970 --> 00:40:55,600
Spectre has been operating for many years,

766
00:40:55,690 --> 00:40:57,050
but he has never shown his tail.

767
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,430
There's no information.

768
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,500
We don't even know where he's from.

769
00:41:01,890 --> 00:41:03,340
We don't know what he looks like.

770
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,240
There are so many people.

771
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,820
How are we going to catch him?

772
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,530
I still believe

773
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,870
that a fox will eventually show its tail.

774
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:17,420
No matter what, we can't lose

775
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,050
this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

776
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,550
As long as he comes to Yungang,

777
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:21,870
we can't let him go.

778
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,070
Hurry up.

779
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,300
Hurry up and load it.

780
00:41:26,710 --> 00:41:27,590
You're all here.

781
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:29,830
Come on, hurry and pack that up.

782
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:31,500
Xu.

783
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,350
How is the preparation?

784
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,860
Don't worry. It's the usual.

785
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,110
