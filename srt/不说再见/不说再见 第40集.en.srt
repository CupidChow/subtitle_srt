Ms. Ou.

4
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,840
Zhao Ran was right.

5
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,210
It really is 7 p.m.

[It's at Ou Zhenhai's house.]

[Glasses is ready to go pick him up.]

8
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,710
All right.

9
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,340
Tell Yuanwen to be ready.

10
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,440
Got it.

11
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,860
Zheng Ke.

12
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,880
We'll stick to the plan.

13
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,060
Connect to the video feed.

14
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,079
Got it.

15
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,370
Hack into the dark web.
Send out the new password.

16
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,380
I'm on it.

17
00:03:15,610 --> 00:03:16,710
Sir.

18
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,900
Mr. Zhou is here.

19
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:23,670
Mr. Zhou.

20
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,250
Mr. Ou, right?

21
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:30,620
Have a seat.

22
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:32,030
Thank you for coming.

23
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,790
Here, have some tea and get refreshed.

24
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,020
Forget about tea.

25
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,910
I have a busy schedule.

26
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:39,020
Let's make it quick.

27
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:40,340
I have a question for you.

28
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,890
Tieguanyin took her own life

29
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,480
and Congtou went missing.

30
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,800
What exactly happened?

31
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:48,130
Problems will always happen in a group

32
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,200
whether big or small.

33
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,280
And these problems
are the private matters of our group.

34
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:55,430
I'm sure we can handle it ourselves.

35
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,020
Private matters?

36
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,160
Fine.

37
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,450
What about Dakun?

38
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,680
What happened to him?

39
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:03,660
He's a traitor.

40
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,350
If he's a traitor,

41
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,410
do you know why he betrayed you?

42
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,170
Why does it seem like you're very
interested in what happened to Dakun?

43

Glasses.

44
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,040
Bring me Dakun's materials.

45
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,230
Show them to Mr. Zhou.

46
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:20,160
-Yes.
-No.

47
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,350
Never mind.

48
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,930
I'm just asking.

49
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,530
Actually,

50
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,290
I wouldn't say I know everything

51
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,870
about your company's situation.

52
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,190
But after staying at Yungang

53
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,340
for so many days,

54
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,190
I've heard a lot about you.

55
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:34,810
I'm thinking.

56
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,659
After Group K has lost

57
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,640
three of the Four Vajras,

58
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:40,750
is your group
still as influential as before?

59
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,640
Should I start to question your abilities?

60
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,450
Glasses.

61
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,300
Get me the ledger.

62
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,409
I'm not from the tax office.

63
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,860
Why do I need your ledger?

64
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,850
It was you who pursued Mr. Spectre
for a partnership.

65
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,480
Out of no choice,

66
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,860
he sent me here to check on you guys.

67
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,190
We were talking about Dakun earlier.

68
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,210
From what I know,

69
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,970
he's in charge of shipping the goods

70
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,640
in your group, am I right?

71
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,010
That's right.

72
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:07,150
Without him,

73
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,000
how will your goods be shipped?

74
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,410
Mr. Zhou.

75
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,340
We have a sales network operating

76
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,660
on the dark web.

77
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,420
If you're interested,

78
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,740
I can show you.

79
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,280
Sure.

80
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,040
To be honest,

81
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,360
I came here to check out

82

your dark web system.

83
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,960
Show me.

84
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,690
My apologies.

85
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,400
Mr. Zhou.

86
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,560
There's a problem
with the Internet connection.

87

Be prepared to take the blame.

Come at me as much as you want.

96
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,630

Why can't I access the dark web?

100
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,630
I followed Mr. Ou's instructions

101
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,300
and handed over the dark web to Ruosheng.

102

But who knew

103

that he acted on his own

104
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,490
and upgraded the dark web system.

105
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,430
And caused the system
to be inaccessible now.

What are you up to?

110
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,460
I'm asking when you can fix it.

111
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,310
I'll fix it as soon as I can.

112
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,550
After I took care of it,
I'll let you know right away.

113
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,580
By then, we can arrange
the shipping immediately.

114
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:32,040
Just ask your buyer
to wait for a while, okay?

115
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,890
I'm telling you. Listen up.

116
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,650
If you ruin the plan,

117
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,100
Mr. Ou won't spare any of you.

118
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:39,960
Who is it?

119
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,770
Why do they need the goods
in such a hurry?

120
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:42,820
Stop asking.

121
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,140
Fix it right away.

122
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,770
Call me when it is fixed.

123

Do you think Mr. Glasses

124
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:55,010
will take the bait?

The system is being upgraded.

Why is it being upgraded
at this point in time?

128

I don't know.

129
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,340
Maybe it was a coincidence.

130

What's wrong?

131
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:24,180
Are you unable to demonstrate
the dark web to me?

132

Your famous dark web system.

133
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,650
Could it be fake?

134
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,980
How can it be fake?

135
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,140
The upgrade won't take long.

136

Please be patient, Mr. Zhou.

137
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:45,170
When it comes to business,

138
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,240
integrity and prudence are very important.

You knew I was coming today,

140
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,590
but you didn't prepare
what you needed to prepare.

141
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:53,840
I'm sorry.

142

I'm not interested in working

Have someone send me back.

Don't leave yet, Mr. Zhou.

Sir, we can't go there.

154

You said it yourself.
This is between you and me.

155

No one else must know about this.

156

would become Spectre's follower.

00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,750
Although he didn't suspect me,

342
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,220
maybe his instincts

343
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:23,420
have already set off a warning.

344
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,400
Don't forget.

345
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,470
Drug dealers' instincts

346
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,580
are more sensitive than most people's.

347
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:32,920
You're right.

348
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,590
People like them

349
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,880
live their lives as a countdown.

350
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,790
They need to be more alert to live longer.

351
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:47,530
Thankfully, Ruosheng
is a careless simpleton.

352
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,480
Otherwise, you might not be able
to get close to him.

353
00:19:59,150 --> 00:20:01,210
Remember the feeling you described
earlier today?

354
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,680
Actually, I have felt it too.

355
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,360
Especially just now.

356
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,900
It became more obvious.

357
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,360
In Li Ruosheng's eyes.

358
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,830
When he looked straight into my eyes.

359
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,450
In his eyes, I can clearly see...

360
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,280
the trust he has in me
more than anyone else.

361
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,800
I really don't know how he will react

362
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,620
when he found out
that I'm a police officer.

363
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,370
You're a police officer.

364
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,220
He's a drug dealer.

365
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:44,730
What kind of reaction can he have?

366
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,320
Just like you said to me earlier today.

367
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:57,970
We must always remember our identities.

368
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:07,340
But don't overthink it.

369
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,560
I think you already did a good job.

370
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,300
Okay, take it down.

371
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:05,640
Hey.

372
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:07,310
Mr. Glasses.

373
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,290
Mr. Mu, you're here too.

374
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,190
Greet Mr. Ou.

375
00:22:13,210 --> 00:22:14,350
Hello, Mr. Ou.

376
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,040
Shall we begin?

377
00:22:17,130 --> 00:22:18,050
Anytime.

378
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:19,900
But I need someone to assist me.

379
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:23,510
Mu Qing, you'll do it.

380
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,360
All of you, get out of the way.

381
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:41,190
These are the ingredients

382
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,820
for making Ecstasy Dream.

383
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,300
-That's all?
-That's right.

384
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,080
Mr. Zhou, don't you need me

385
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,450
to get you anything else?

386
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:53,820
Get me a beaker then.

387
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,530
Mr. Ou.

388
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:00,770
You don't need many tools

389
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,010
to make Ecstasy Dream.

390
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,160
You don't even have to wear a gas mask.

391
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,980
Even an ordinary man
that has zero chemistry knowledge

392
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,870
can use cooking utensils

393
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,320
to make Ecstasy Dream.

394
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,840
What do you think? Isn't it incredible?

395
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,930
Right, get me a glass of purified water.

396
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,880
These ingredients

397
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,130
have passed all the security checks
overseas and Yungang.

398
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,760
They weren't detected.

399
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,160
Let me put it this way.

400
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,550
Every police force across the world

401
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,580
has no knowledge about these ingredients.

402
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,910
So they don't even know what these are.

403
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:48,910
Mu Qing.

404
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,150
Would you like to try it? It's very sweet.

405
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,760
Let's not do that.

406
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,320
Watch carefully.

407
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,810
One cup of ingredients

408
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,400
can make up to 30g of Ecstasy Dream.

409
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,530
Okay.

410
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,110
The show is over.

411
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,220
I present to you Ecstasy Dream.

412
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,560
That's it?

413
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,010
If you don't believe me,

414
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,420
have someone try it.

415
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,890
Who wants to try?

416
00:24:55,610 --> 00:24:56,890
You'll do it.

417
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,220
No, Mr. Shao Nan.

418
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:00,930
Mr. Shao Nan.

419
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:09,870
Don't touch me.

420
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,760
I want to dance.

421
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,690
Let's dance!

422
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:15,720
Dance.

423
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,010
I want to dance.

424
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,240
Mr. Ou.

425
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,560
See?

426
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:22,050
It only takes 30 seconds.

427
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,550
And you'll feel like flying.

428
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,620
That's the charm of Ecstasy Dream.

429
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:28,080
If I didn't see it with my own eyes,

430
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,460
it's hard to believe

431
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,750
how powerful Ecstasy Dream is.

432
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,310
Mr. Zhou.

433
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,910
Let's go back and talk about it then.

434
00:25:39,790 --> 00:25:40,750
Sure.

435
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,700
The lab report is out.

436
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,270
G3307.

437
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,670
Ecstasy Dream.

438
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,700
The transformation of meth.

439
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,210
It's more penetrative towards
the blood-brain barrier.

440
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,480
And it is more addictive.

441
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,730
The synthesis is very simple.

442
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,100
All you need to do is to put
the different components together

443
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,510
according to a ratio

444
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,050
and mixed them with purified water.

445
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,070
Then the chemical reaction
will be facilitated.

446
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:16,920
After the chemical reaction took place,

447
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:19,560
a simple purification process is enough

448
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:22,380
to extract a fine quality product.

449
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:25,190
Gosh.

450
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,220
Isn't Ecstasy Dream a monster?

451
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:34,780
[Police for the public]

452
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,020
I saw it with my own eyes.

453
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:32,580
It didn't even take 30 seconds
to make a man go crazy.

454
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:34,870
I've been a police officer
for so many years.

455
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,630
I've never seen

456
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:39,760
[Police for the public]

457
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,260
such an aggressive drug before.

458
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,570
If this drug spreads out in China.

459
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,680
[Police for the public]

460
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,730
I can't imagine the consequences.

461
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,000
That's right.

462
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,980
The synthesis of this new drug

463
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,260
is very simple.

464
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,450
It's almost undetectable.

465
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,000
It is also highly addictive.

466
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:55,240
Conventional drug abstinence methods
won't work at all.

467
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,220
Captain Rong.

468
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,890
What should we do next?

469
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,520
Is it 60%

470
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,500
up-front?

471
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,100
Mr. Zhou,

472
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,210
you're being ridiculous.

473
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,760
That's not what I want.

474
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,430
This is Spectre's request.

475
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,590
You're only providing the ingredients.

476
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,000
And you're asking for 60%.

477
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:24,590
We have to risk our lives
to distribute the goods.

478
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,720
I can't accept that.

479
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,280
Whether you accept it or not,

480
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,610
that's the asking price from Spectre.

481
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:35,110
It's not negotiable.

482
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:51,300
Sir, what should we do?

483
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:54,820
If we have to pay them
the 60% deposits at once,

484
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,010
we still have to pay

485
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,210
for the raw materials in advance.

486
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,320
Judging by the group's current situation,

487
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:01,590
we can't hold on financially.

488
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,070
Is that what Yuanwen and Rong Yu said?

489
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:16,290
[Police for the public]

490
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:10,530
I've spoken to them.

491
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,550
But they insisted

492
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:14,570
to make more contact with Zhou Changhao

493
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:15,940
and earn his trust.

494
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,740
We can use him to get closer

495
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,370
to finding out Spectre's whereabouts.

496
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,480
If we arrest Zhou Changhao right now,

497
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:23,810
this line of clue
would be completely disconnected.

498
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:25,790
I agree. We shouldn't alert them.

499
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,330
Otherwise,

500
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,670
finding Spectre will be more difficult
in the future.

501
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,290
Once Ecstasy Dream spreads

502
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:32,790
across the country,

503
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,330
we will be put in a passive spot

what's going on behind it.

506
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,610
They have their reasons.

507
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,870

508

Once he leaves the country,

510
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:53,290
it will be hard to find him.

511
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:58,220
[Police for the public]

512
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,690
Director Liu.

513
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:03,060
[Police for the public]

514
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:02,750
I actually support their proposal.

515
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,360
Tell me what you think.

516
00:29:06,930 --> 00:29:08,030
Think about it.

517
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,280
According to Rong Yu's information,

518
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,300
Mr. Ou and this Zhou Changhao

519
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:13,710
haven't come to an agreement.

520
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,230
That means Zhou Changhao will have
to stay in Yungang for a little longer.

521
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:22,380
[Police for the public]

522
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,960
I think we can make use
of this period of time

523
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:22,250
and let them get in touch
with Zhou Changhao.

524
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:26,250
[Police for the public]

525
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,090
Gain Spectre's trust

526
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,030
and convince him to come
to Yungang sooner.

527
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:29,940
If this works out,

528
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,670
it will make arresting Spectre
much easier.

529
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:36,240
[Police for the public]

530
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,750
I think that's what they're thinking.

531
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,130
Have you thought about it?

532
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,110
If they do that,

533
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,910
they'll be interfering with the deal.

534
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,500
This will directly affect

535
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:44,510
Ou Zhenhai's interest.

536
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:45,870
In other words,

537
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,290
they're fighting this old fox head-on.

538
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,060
It's very risky.

539
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:53,700
But Yuanwen and Rong Yu
are very meticulous.

540
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,040
Since that's what they suggested,

541
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,840
they'll find a way to deal with it.

542
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,860
Besides,

543
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,980
Group K has lost most of their men,

544
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:08,660
[Police for the public]

545
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:04,090
they're all relying on Mr. Ou alone.

546
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,310
So making a deal with Spectre
is their only chance to make a comeback.

547
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:14,030
[Police for the public]

548
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,850
I think

549
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:12,180
as long as we can take
advantage of his weakness,

550
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,940
it will make things a lot easier.

551
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,430
Okay.

552
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,760
Let's do it their way.

553
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,170
I'll inform Director Wang.

554
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,640
[Police for the public]

555
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:23,710
Okay.

556
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:37,530
Sir, your clams.

557
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,430
I didn't order this, sir.

558
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,020
It's a treat from them.

559
00:30:47,250 --> 00:30:48,350
Cheers.

560
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,580
So Mu Qing,

561
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,870
you're not just the developer
of the dark web.

562
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:00,930
You're also Mr. Ou's future son-in-law.

563
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:03,400
Yes.

564
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:06,210
You know, when love comes,

565
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,840
you can't stop it even if you want to.

566
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,010
Stop it? Were you trying to stop it?

567
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,950
-Explain yourself.
-That's not what I meant.

568
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,000
So...

569
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,420
I guess this isn't just

570
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,520
a simple coincidence.

571
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,130
Yes.

572
00:31:21,570 --> 00:31:23,070
This isn't a coincidence.

573
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,710
So you two are here
to convince me on Mr. Ou's behalf?

574
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,390
Convince you?

575
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:29,970
What do you mean?

576
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,010
Don't you know?

577
00:31:35,430 --> 00:31:37,850
It's 60% up-front payment.

578
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,920
That was the price I offered Mr. Ou.

579
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,120
That's too high.

580
00:31:46,430 --> 00:31:47,530
To be honest,

581
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:49,070
I made such an offer

582
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:51,930
hoping that Mr. Ou would back out.

583
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,230
Why?

584
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,650
Weren't you here to make a deal?

585
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,790
Yes.

586
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,550
That's what I thought before coming here.

587
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,670
But after seeing
the current situation of Group K,

588
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:03,900
I've changed my mind.

589
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,040
I was thinking,

590
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,760
for a group

591
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,520
that can collapse anytime,

592
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,510
I really couldn't think of a reason
to make you my partner.

593
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,670
In that case,

594
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,510
I'll get straight to the point.

595
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,640
Yes, we're here to convince you.

596
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,710
But it's not for my dad.

597
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,110
This is for us.

598
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,630
We hope you can work with us.

599
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,850
On what ground?

600
00:32:29,810 --> 00:32:31,270
She's Mr. Ou's daughter.

601
00:32:31,530 --> 00:32:33,730
In the future,
she'll be taking over Mr. Ou's place.

602
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,030
As for me, I have full control
over our group's sales network.

603
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:38,790
You saw it yourself.

604
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,080
It's the only thing
that's good enough for you.

605
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,800
We're confident and capable of making sure

606
00:32:43,890 --> 00:32:46,140
that this strategy will be spread
across the whole country.

607
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,940
Or even all over Asia.

608
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,660
Mr. Zhou,

609
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,200
you're a smart man.

610
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:52,820
I suppose

611
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,410
that's what you want too.

612
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,500
Go on.

613
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,280
You were a pharmaceutical researcher
at Feiteng Pharmaceuticals.

614
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,300
Your field of research

615
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,880
was one of the best in the industry.

616
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,900
You worked there for five years,

617
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,490
but you were only a researcher.

618
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:09,940
Later on,

619
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:12,670
because of a minor experiment accident,

620
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,340
your career was ended.

621
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,060
You were in prison for five years.

622
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,040
No one dared to hire you
when you were released.

623
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,710
You were frustrated.

624
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:22,040
After all, you worked so hard

625
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:23,230
hoping that a new drug

626
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,460
can be developed earlier.

627
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,130
All you wanted was fame and fortune.

628
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,180
So you started working for Spectre.

629
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,940
You helped him develop Ecstasy Dream.

630
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:33,570
But have you thought about this?

631
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,080
You've done so much for him
all these years.

632
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,790
What did he give you?

633
00:33:40,390 --> 00:33:42,060
How dare you run a background check on me?

634
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:45,450
Is everyone in Group K so bold?

635
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,660
If you're trying to drive a wedge

636
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,110
between Spectre and me,

637
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,260
I'm sorry.

638
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:52,880
You've got the wrong person.

639
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,640
It's 60%.

640
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,460
I can't give the 60% Spectre wants.

641
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,360
But I can give you 20%.

642
00:34:03,050 --> 00:34:04,190
Is this bribery?

643
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,970
Bribery doesn't seem appropriate.

644
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,389
But think about it.

645
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,860
Can Spectre give you

646
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,190
the sum of 20%?

647
00:34:18,710 --> 00:34:19,900
Think about it.

648
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,710
However,

649
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,659
if you really want the money,

650
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:27,860
you have to help us.

651
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:30,850
Mr. Zhou.

652
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,090
We've talked a lot.

653
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,409
You must be thirsty.

654
00:34:33,489 --> 00:34:34,730
Here, have more wine.

655
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:38,420
Let's have a drink.

656
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:39,739
Here.

657
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,050
What do you

658
00:34:47,929 --> 00:34:49,070
want me to do?

659
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,659
It's 30%.

660
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,340
And 50% up-front payment.

661
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,970
This is Spectre's final offer.

662
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,480
Sir.

663
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,770
I can accept

664
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:09,490
this offer.

665
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:13,230
However, there is a condition.

666
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,160
Tell me.

667
00:35:15,690 --> 00:35:18,240
I hope your daughter will be in charge of
making deals with Spectre

668
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:20,180
in the future.

669
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,390
What do you mean?

670
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,970
It means what it says.

671
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,650
This afternoon,

672
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,940
your daughter, your son-in-law, and I

673
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,790
had lunch together by the beach.

674
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:02,940
The 30% offer

675
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:06,020
was what your daughter had begged me.

676
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,830
To be honest,

677
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,260
initially, I didn't like Group K at all.

678
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,330
It was Mu Qing.

679
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,000
His name is Mu Qing, right?

680
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,950
It was his dark web trading system

681
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,540
that gave me

682
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,080
a little excitement.

683
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,940
But after the meal,

684
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,880
I found that your daughter

685
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:28,420
is quite smart.

686
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:32,510
And I like working with smart people.

687
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,780
Mr. Ou.

688
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:46,330
You're counting on this deal
to make a comeback.

689
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:48,700
As for what you can do

690
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,920
to save your sinking ship in specific...

691
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,190
You're a businessman.

692
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,350
I believe you know better than I do.

693
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,460
Besides,

694
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,530
Ou Kexin and Mu Qing.

695
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,540
One is your daughter.

696
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,770
The other is your son-in-law.

697
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:03,930
No matter what you think of it,

698
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,480
it's still better
than working with outsiders.

699
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:07,980
Right?

700
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,080
If you agree,

701
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,940
I will inform Spectre to come to Yungang
as soon as possible.

702
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:21,090
If you don't...

703
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,090
Game over.

704
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,330
Okay.

705
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,510
Goodbye, my friend.

706
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:43,920
Wait.

707
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:47,840
Is there anything else, Mr. Ou?

708
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,870
Did Zhou Changhao tell you everything?

709
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,950
-You...
-Go ahead and hit me.

710
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:08,250
I did it because
I want to be by your side.

711
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:11,770
So you were lying to me until now.

712
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:13,450
I wasn't trying to lie to you.

713
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:15,870
But I can't let that punk

714
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:16,920
have his way with you.

715
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:18,330
I know.

716
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,830
I know everything.

717
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,590
You didn't really want me
to get engaged with Mu Qing.

718
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,820
You want us to go abroad

719
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:24,970
because you want me
to stay out of this mess.

720
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:27,040
I also know that you need this deal.

721
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:29,730
But did Zhou Changhao and his boss

722
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,180
give you this chance?

723
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,030
You can't do it alone.

724
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:36,240
I just don't want to see
you being bullied.

725
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,390
Yet you jumped into the firepit yourself.

726
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,240
I'm already in the fire pit.

727
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,390
I'm your daughter.

728
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:43,010
Why can't I share the burden with you?

729
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,550
Kexin.

730
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,220
All I have ever wanted is

731
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:48,160
for you to have a clean background.

732
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,010
I want to keep you away
from all this mess.

733
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,280
You...

734
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,100
Fine.

735
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,590
It's my fault.

736
00:39:04,790 --> 00:39:06,290
I failed to protect you.

737
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:13,150
Don't say that.

738
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,410
Don't blame yourself.

739
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,830
I told you before.

740
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,470
Home is wherever I'm with you.

741
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,580
I don't ever want to be away
from you again.

742
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,500
Now that we're in it together.

743
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,510
You and I both.

744
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,810
There's no turning back for us.

745
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,200
As long as I can be with you,

746
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:41,270
I've never thought of a way out.

747
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,930
And Mu Qing.

748
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:51,480
If it weren't for him and his dark web,

749
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,730
Zhou Changhao
wouldn't give me this chance.

750
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,560
If the business succeeds,

751
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:01,380
you have to thank him.

752
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,480
Okay, Mr. Ou.

753
00:40:17,570 --> 00:40:20,560
I'll get Spectre to come to Yungang
as soon as possible to work with you two.

754
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,230
I'll leave Yungang tomorrow.

755
00:40:23,150 --> 00:40:24,340
Thank you for coming.

756
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,670
Your daughter put in the most effort.

757
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,570
She did most of the work.

758
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:32,170
I'll let you know the exact time.

759
00:40:32,790 --> 00:40:34,070
I'll be waiting to hear from you.

760
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,080
Goodbye.

761
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,010
