[Episode 28]

3
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:35,080
By guessing odd or even?

4
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,539
I think it's better to let fate decide.

5
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:39,650
Black is even and white is odd.

6
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,250
Which one will you pick?

7
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,789
Odd or even?

8
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:51,400
Odds aren't in pairs.

9
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,080
While they are free-spirited,

10
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,900
I'd rather have someone helping me.

11
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,820
There's a hidden meaning in your words.

12
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,680
Sir.

13
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,390
I don't mean anything at all.

14
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,370
I'm just talking about chess.

15
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,410
Congtou was right.

16
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,840
If we keep digging into this,

17
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:16,040
no matter who is falsely accused,

18
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:18,020
everyone will be hurt.

19
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,920
If you were me,

20
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,290
what would you do?

21
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,740
I pick black.

22
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:27,650
I'll pick white then.

23
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,650
If I were you,

24
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:33,730
I probably wouldn't suspect anyone.

25
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,280
You seem to resent me a lot.

26
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,650
Sir.

27
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,850
I'm just a little sad.

28
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:43,050
I know how you feel.

29
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,520
But I'm going to keep investigating.

30
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,540
I'm telling you.

31
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,270
Among the three of you,

32
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,940
one of you

33
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,829
won't make it out of this house.

34
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:56,960
And you...

35
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,810
are the most suspicious one.

36
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,030
Sir.

37
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,750
I've made my moves.

38
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,960
It's white.

39
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,030
You mean,

40
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,630
in order to
find Zheng Ke's daughter, Xiaoxiao.

41
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,079
It will be through Glasses.

42
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,090
That's right.

43
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,410
Glasses would not keep Xiaoxiao

44
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,640
at Mr. Ou's house.

45
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:23,670
He would leave her to his men.

46
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:26,090
So you must get Glasses's phone.

47
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,640
At least, you'll need his phone number.

48
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,850
Then we can look into his call history

49
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,700
and track each of his contact's locations.

50
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,380
Then we'll be able to find Xiaoxiao.

51
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,740
I'll take care of that.

52
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,980
Go ahead and ask.

53
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:55,650
What do you want to ask me?

54
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,200
In the past,
when you wanted to ask me something,

55
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,000
you would always touch your nose.

56
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,360
You haven't changed.

57
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,150
I only do that in front of you.

58
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,860
I'm worried.

59
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,940
The bureau told you about me.

60
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:18,399
Will they also at some point

61
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,899
inform Yuanwen about it?

62
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,920
Not at the moment.

63
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,310
I know.

64
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:30,020
I know what you're worried about.

65
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,480
I also know

66
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,990
that you're going through a lot right now.

67
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,890
But it's a mission.

68
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,310
Until the mission is complete,

69
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,610
all of us have to take this test.

70
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,360
I know.

71
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,120
But...

72
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:53,600
It's really hard.

73
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,250
I have to face the man I love every day

74
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,150
with a different identity.

75
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,570
There were a few times
when he looked at me,

76
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,330
it reminded me of the old times

77
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,600
we spent together.

78
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,680
I'm so scared I can't hold it in.

79
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,170
But don't worry.

80
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,810
I know.

81
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,370
I know who I am and what I should do.

82
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,270
I'm not the Rong Yu you used to know.

83
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,140
I trust you.

84
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,130
Do your best.

85
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,390
You must get Glasses's phone.

86
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,290
At least, you'll need his phone number.

87
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,940
You guys are all here.

88
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,920
You're finally back. This is so boring.

89
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,460
Did you bring us food?

90
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,470
It's not for you.

91
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,790
It's for my Qingqing.

92
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,159
Where is he?

93
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,260
Kexin.

94
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,600
Mu Qing is upstairs

95
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,700
chatting with your dad.

96
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,280
Okay, I'll go upstairs to find him.

97
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,010
They're talking about something serious.

98
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:49,980
Don't disturb them.

99
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,870
What is it that I can't hear?

100
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,940
-Let me go.
-Kexin, listen to me.

101
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,390
I say you shouldn't go.

102
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,800
Mr. Glasses, what are you doing?

103
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,760
Let me go!

104
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:58,950
Ms. Ou.

105
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:00,450
Can't you see the situation?

106
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,340
We're being detained here

107
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:04,360
by your dad.

108
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,120
You're detained?

109
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,600
Aren't you just staying here

110
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,100
for a few days for business matters?

111
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,420
Why are you detained?

112
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,540
Li Ruosheng.

113
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,790
Mr. Glasses.

114
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,580
Is none of you going to tell me?

115
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:27,590
It's okay.

116
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:29,050
I'll call someone to ask.

117
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,280
I'll ask Guanyin.

118
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,690
Kexin.

119
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,240
I told you.

120
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,600
This has nothing to do with you.

121
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,630
Mu Qing is my boyfriend.
How can I stay out of it?

122
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,430
-Why can't I make a call?
-Kexin, be good.

123
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,970
-What are you doing?
-It's none of your business.

124
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,380
-Don't call anyone.
-Don't stop me.

125
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,700
-Kexin.
-Ms. Ou.

126
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,090
Even if you call Guanyin,

127
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:49,290
she won't be able to answer.

128
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:51,220
Something had happened to her.

129
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,470
Congtou.

130
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,290
What happened to her?

131
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,530
Congtou, tell me.

132
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:05,430
Guanyin was arrested.

133
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,930
Your dad suspects

134
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,560
there's a mole among the three of us.

135
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,640
That's why he keeps us all here.

136
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,620
Congtou.

137
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:15,330
You've said enough.

138
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:19,730
I understand it now.

139
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,070
So my dad thinks

140
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,230
that one of you sold out Guanyin, right?

141
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:29,770
But he can't suspect Mu Qing.

142
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,320
-Don't do this, Kexin.
-Don't stop me!

143
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:33,990
-Listen to me, Kexin.
-Don't stop me!

144
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:37,990
Mr. Glasses!

145
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:42,830
Kexin.

146
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,799
Don't stop me!

147
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,940
Was Tieguanyin doing business with you?

148
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,940
She had suppliers.

149
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,840
She wanted to make a few deals
through the dark web.

150
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,070
But I turned her down.

151
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,930
Did she see the terminal server

152
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,120
of your dark web?

153
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,350
She requested a few times.

154
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,110
And she always came uninvited.

155
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,660
What time did they usually leave?

156
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,900
They usually

157
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,520
left pretty late.

158
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,200
Were you the last person to see her?

159
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,050
I'm not sure about that.

160
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:36,470
But when Tieguanyin was arrested,

161
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,960
I was with Kexin.

162
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,860
But you met her that day at least.

163
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,260
Yes.

164
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:43,020
Before the incident,

165
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,260
we did meet up.

166
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,350
Were you with Kexin at other times?

167
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,590
I was doing my own thing

168
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,480
for the rest of that day.

169
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,210
Dad.

170
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:58,730
Why are you here?

171
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,970
What? Do I have to report to you
that I'm coming home?

172
00:10:01,150 --> 00:10:03,170
Besides, if I hadn't come back,

173
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,760
you'd really think

174
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:06,170
that Mu Qing is a traitor.

175
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,070
Mu Qing, put the cake on the table

176
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,570
and bring some plates over.

177
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,020
Go on.

178
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,410
Sir.

179
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,950
I'll go get the plates.

180
00:10:56,190 --> 00:10:58,390
You just like to spy on us, don't you?

181
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,800
-Stop spying.
-What are you doing?

182
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:00,770
What am I doing?

183
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,350
Before this,

184
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,800
you asked Mr. Glasses to spy on me.

185
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,870
Now, you're spying on Mu Qing with this.

186
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,760
Would you set up surveillance
at my place next?

187
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:08,910
It's for your own good.

188
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,230
For my own good?

189
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,730
Dad, I'm telling you.

190
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,670
You cannot suspect Mu Qing no matter what.

191
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:34,560
I told you he was with me that day.

192
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,790
What did I suspect about him?

193
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,950
Guanyin was arrested by the police, right?

194
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,970
Since you knew Guanyin was arrested,

195
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,340
you also know what we do.

196
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,760
Do you think it's appropriate
to barge in and turn that off?

197
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,690
Yes. It's appropriate.

198
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,850
You cannot suspect Mu Qing no matter what.

199
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,530
[There is no mole. Don't worry.]

200
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,250
I'm asking you.

201
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,140
What exactly is your
relationship with him?

202
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,810
He's my boyfriend.

203
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,310
What other relationship can we have?

204
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,280
You're ridiculous.

205
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,430
Don't you know what we do?

206
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:28,190
You don't have to remind me.

207
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,600
I know it clearly.

208
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,020
I'm telling you, I don't agree.

209
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,340
It has nothing to do with me

210
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:34,310
even if you disagree.

211
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,850
Whatever it is,

212
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,040
don't you dare touch him.

213
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:39,500
Otherwise, I'll make you regret it
for the rest of your life.

214
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,910
I'm regretting it already.

215
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,230
What are you regretting?

216
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,090
Do you regret letting him stay by my side?

217
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:46,850
You agreed to it yourself.

218
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,390
It's too late to regret it.

219
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,540
Come in.

220
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:56,970
Sir.

221
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,730
I brought the plates and cutleries.

222
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,740
Let's have the cake now.

223
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,890
Thank you,

224
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,290
but I don't want to eat anymore.

225
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,130
Go and play chess with him.

226
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,450
Go on.

227
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,120
Here.

228
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,890
You can have it back.

229
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,010
I won't annoy you anymore. I'm going out.

230
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:45,190
Sir, shall we continue?

231
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,380
Look.

232
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,010
Even my screen is broken.

233
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,550
I can't even turn on my phone.

234
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:28,050
Mr. Glasses.

235
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,720
Tell me what I should do.

236
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,140
I have to call a client later.

237
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:33,150
I'm sorry.

238
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,780
Don't panic. How about this?

239
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,160
Go and get a new phone for Kexin.

240
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,120
No need.

241
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,840
I'll just use yours.

242
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,340
Hey, Kexin.

243
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,840
I can't let anyone else use my phone.

244
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:44,810
Give it back.

245
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:46,610
Whoever broke my phone

246
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,890
must take responsibility.

247
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,560
What's the password?

248
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,330
What's the password?

249
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:53,610
Give me the phone.

250
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,930
-Give it to me.
-Don't snatch it.

251
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,030
Kexin.

252
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,450
It's unlocked now.

253
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:00,470
-Kexin, give me back my phone.
-Don't get near.

254
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,530
-Stop it.
-Don't get near.

255
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,290
-Give it to me.
-Mr. Glasses, stand still.

256
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:04,830
I'll break it if you come closer.

257
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,680
If it falls, we'll both
lose our cell phones.

258
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,000
-Give it back.
-I'm breaking it.

259
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,150
-Make it quick.
-Yes.

260
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,110
Hello, I'm Ou Kexin.

261
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,300
I'm sorry.

262
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,150
I don't think I can make it today.

263
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:43,070
Okay, let's set another appointment.

264
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,750
Bye.

265
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,360
Zheng Ke.

266
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,780
Look into this number right away

267
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,900
-and all of its call history.
-Okay. Got it.

268
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,350
I'm just kidding.

269
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,680
This move

270
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:30,540
doesn't leave you in a good place.

271
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:32,960
All these pieces are aligned.

272
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,290
They can either attack or defend.

273
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,610
They can march ahead or retreat.

274
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,280
Are you trying to make me

275
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,470
change strategies

276
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,890
so that you can take half of my nation?

277
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,580
You're underestimating me.

278
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,000
Sir.

279
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,450
I'll get to the point.

280
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,310
You saw how we grew our business.

281
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,250
We were powerless.

282
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,660
In the beginning,

283
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,020
we didn't even have a territory.

284
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,560
If we want to stand out,

285
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,850
it will definitely affect
the interest of our men.

286
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,750
But we didn't do it on purpose.

287
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,420
At least,

288
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:11,109
we wouldn't dare to affect your interest.

289
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,950
I know that.

290
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,640
All rookies want to stand out.

291
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,930
But those four people under me

292
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:19,109
have their own plans.

293
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,280
But you took a step too far

294
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,170
and too recklessly.

295
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,069
After you fell out with Ruosheng,

296
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,960
you went to work
with Tieguanyin right away.

297
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,190
Once Tieguanyin is arrested,

298
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,510
you'll naturally be

299
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,920
the biggest beneficiary.

300
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,170
Don't you think you're too greedy?

301
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:38,120
Attention, all departments.

302
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,220
In this operation,

303
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,410
we located the suspect

304
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,870
through a phone number.

305
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,900
All departments, please lay low.

306
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,170
Don't alert them.

307
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,650
[-Task Force One, copy that.]
[-Task Force Two, copy that.]

308
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,080
Do you think I'm the biggest suspect?

309
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,450
That's right.

310
00:18:05,310 --> 00:18:06,280
What do you think

311
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:09,360
I'm going to do with you next?

312
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,210
You're going to kill me.

313
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,410
If I were you,

314
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,090
I'd rather kill the wrong man

315
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,640
than keep a possible troublemaker.

316
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,560
Do you know

317
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,920
why you're the biggest suspect?

318
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,880
It's because of your background.

319
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,820
It's scary how clean it is.

320
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:38,400
What's more,

321
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,040
the factory was mysteriously closed down,

322
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:42,930
Tieguanyin was mysteriously arrested,

323
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,090
and Congtou was mysteriously involved.

324
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,640
You mysteriously fell out with Ruosheng.

325
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:50,020
Putting all these
mysterious coincidences together,

326
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,140
I can't help but be suspicious.

327
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,020
Sir.

328
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,400
A black stone can never turn white

329
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:01,720
no matter how hard it tries.

330
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:03,130
A white stone can never turn black

331
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:04,490
no matter how hard it tries.

332
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,520
Given your skills and resources,

333
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,720
it's very easy for you

334
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,870
to find out the truth.

335
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:12,540
You're right.

336
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,450
In this game of chess,

337
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,430
there are always black and white.

338
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,280
But the point is

339
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,780
this game is mine.

340
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:25,480
I won't allow myself to lose.

341
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,170
How did it go?

342
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,890
We tailed everyone on his phone records.

343
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,580
We didn't find anything about Xiaoxiao.

344
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,790
Captain Rong.

345
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,900
We can't risk the whole team

346
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:55,310
because of my personal problem.

347
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,630
Don't say that.

348
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,990
It's our responsibility as well.

349
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,210
Come on.

350
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:16,870
Hold on.

351
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:19,200
What are you doing?

352
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,400
Where are you taking him?

353
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,850
We'll question him somewhere else.

354
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,610
Why can't you do it at home?

355
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,980
It's none of your business.

356
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,950
Ruosheng.

357
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,570
Take Kexin out for a walk.

358
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,630
Dad, let me tell you.

359
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,260
Don't hurt your future son-in-law.

360
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,560
"Son-in-law"?

361
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,680
Mu Qing and I

362
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,310
had done what couples would do.

363
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,670
We want to be together forever.

364
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,190
Is she telling the truth?

365
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,420
Why would I lie?

366
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,920
Dad, I've failed in every relationship.

367
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,990
I finally met someone I truly like.

368
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,580
He has the ability to help you.

369
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,030
Why won't you support us?

370
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,010
-That's ridiculous!
-He's on our side.

371
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,030
He would never betray you.

372
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:03,990
Mu Qing.

373
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,310
If there's a misunderstanding,

374
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,370
explain it to Dad.

375
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,640
If you had really wronged him,

376
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,180
just apologize to him.

377
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,900
-Do you have to do this?
-Ruosheng.

378
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,350
Didn't you hear me?

379
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,450
Get her out of here!

380
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:14,770
Hurry up.

381
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,680
-Don't touch me!
-Get out!

382
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:23,880
Come on. Let's talk outside.

383
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,020
Okay? Come on.

384
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:40,380
Take him to the back.

385
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,510
He had never been so mad at me.

386
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,400
How could he talk to me like that?

387
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,420
-I need to talk to him.
-My gosh.

388
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,880
Don't go inside.

389
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,500
Godfather is obviously angry.

390
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,480
If you go in now,
you'll give him more trouble.

391
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,100
Sir.

392
00:22:12,670 --> 00:22:14,350
Did he admit that he did it?

393
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,670
Then tell me.

394
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:28,820
Is Mu Qing going to be all right?

395
00:22:30,710 --> 00:22:31,900
I think he'll be fine.

396
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,150
Godfather is only anxious

397
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,470
because he can't find the mole.

398
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,960
You even threw a tantrum at him.

399
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,280
He must be furious.

400
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,870
So he had to take it out on someone.

401
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,450
Then you go inside.

402
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,740
-Back him up.
-I can do that.

403
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,230
But not now.

404
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,830
Wait until Godfather calms down.

405
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:49,630
I'll go talk to him, okay?

406
00:22:50,510 --> 00:22:51,530
You're a scaredy-cat.

407
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,370
I'll go if you don't.

408
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,040
If you were of any help,

409
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,670
Godfather wouldn't have kicked you out.

410
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,510
Listen, you'll only make it worse

411
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,750
for Mu Qing if you go in now.

412
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,510
Listen to me, okay?

413
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,930
Why don't you go back first?

414
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,110
Okay?

415
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,270
You can't do anything even if you stay.

416
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,720
How about this?

417
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,660
Deliver my message to him.

418
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,820
Tell him

419
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,840
that I'm a woman of my word.

420
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,600
If he does anything to Mu Qing,

421
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,450
I'll make him regret it his whole life.

422
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,070
Go home.

423
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,740
I'll call you if anything comes up, okay?

424
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:38,120
Keep in touch, okay?

425
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,530
Go.

426
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:44,060
What's wrong?

427
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,470
What will you tell him?

428
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,060
"You'll make him regret it
his whole life."

429
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,960
Okay, just go home.

430
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,510
Drive safely.

431
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,240
Godfather.

432
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,480
Has she left?

433
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,200
Yes.

434
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,740
Can you tell me

435
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:54,550
where Mu Qing went?

436
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,260
It's none of your business.

437
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,130
What happened at the warehouse
and the factory

438
00:25:00,530 --> 00:25:02,200
isn't Mu Qing's fault.

439
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,870
I didn't say that.

440
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:06,430
Then what did he do wrong?

441
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,440
Nothing.

442
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:11,880
Godfather.

443
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,610
Then I think

444
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:17,470
it's quite unfair to Mu Qing.

445
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,690
Have you never suspected him before?

446
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,520
It's true that Mu Qing and I

447
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:26,890
are on bad terms lately.

448
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,560
I just hope

449
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,010
that he wasn't being used by others

450
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:32,430
and did something
that would hurt the group.

451
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,660
By any chance...

452
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,860
If there really is proof

453
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,360
that Mu Qing is the mole,

454
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,390
I hope you can leave him to me.

455
00:25:52,490 --> 00:25:53,720
I'll take care of it myself.

456
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,430
Hello.

457
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:22,020
[Have you arrived?]

458
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,420
Yes.

459
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,180
Glasses.

460
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,640
Keep Mu Qing alive for now.

461
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,110
Let's wait until Luotuo finds the mole.

462
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:05,750
Go ahead.

463
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,510
[Mu Qing is in danger.]

464
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:11,730
Director Liu.

465
00:27:15,650 --> 00:27:16,570
Director Liu.

466
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,430
What's wrong?

467
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:23,090
I just heard from Skylark.

468
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:25,990
Yuanwen is in trouble.

469
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:40,330
Hey, Li Ruosheng.

470
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,960
Did you send my message to my dad?

471
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,060
I did.

472
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,570
He promised he wouldn't
harm Mu Qing for now.

473
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,650
[But they took him anyway.]

474
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,230
I don't know where they went.

475
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:51,860
They took him away?

476
00:27:51,990 --> 00:27:53,310
My men are looking into it.

477
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,410
Don't worry.

478
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,040
I'll let you know if there's any news.

479
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,370
Then where are you now?

480
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,050
Send me your location. I'll come to you.

481
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,060
Okay.

482
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,150
[Kexin]

483
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:41,930
Kexin.

484
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,500
Hello.

485
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,220
Boss.

486
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,040
Understood.

487
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,430
Have you thought about
what will happen if you kill me?

488
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,190
I don't care what will happen.

489
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,950
I'm just following orders.

490
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:15,940
Is this Glasses's order or Mr. Ou's?

491
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,080
Shao Nan.

492
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,020
Do you think

493
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,640
you'll get promoted if you kill me?

494
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:33,450
I have contributed a lot to Mr. Ou.

495
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:34,860
It is very likely

496
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,630
that I'll be Mr. Ou's son-in-law soon.

497
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,350
If you kill me,

498
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,680
it's fine if Mr. Ou
doesn't blame you for it.

499
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,010
But if Mr. Ou is to blame someone,

500
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,740
what do you think will happen to you?

501
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:48,550
By then,

502
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:51,800
Glasses will probably blame it all on you.

503
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,870
He'll make it look like

504
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,160
you killed me for personal reasons.

505
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:59,990
By then, the effort you've put in

506
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,800
might win you a bullet in the head.

507
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,530
Think about it.

508
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,000
I'm thirsty, Shao Nan.

509
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,590
Does your head hurt?

510
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:50,540
Don't worry.

511
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:56,000
It's a normal reaction from an anesthetic.

512
00:30:56,350 --> 00:30:57,800
Hang in there and you'll be fine.

513
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,280
Why did you kidnap me here?

514
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,600
You tell me.

515
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:29,920
This guy.

516
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:31,770
Do you know him?

517
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,970
Take a good look.

518
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,430
Take a good look.

519
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:45,500
What does...

520
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,650
What does he have anything to do

521
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:48,660
with you kidnapping me?

522
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:50,030
Of course he's related to this.

523
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:52,310
Because of him,

524
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,730
my parents were arrested in Thailand.

525
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,750
And I...

526
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:00,540
I became Interpol's wanted suspect.

527
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,780
His name is Rong Yao.

528
00:32:10,930 --> 00:32:14,890
He's Interpol's right-hand man.

529
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:16,030
He's also the one

530
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,200
who is investigating your dad in Yungang.

531
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:28,130
Don't think I didn't see anything

532
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,300
at the bookstore that day.

533
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,290
What did he tell you?

534
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,190
What did he say to make you cry so hard?

535
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:42,830
He's a police officer.

536
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:44,760
And you...

537
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,900
must be an undercover agent.

538
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,130
Am I right?

539
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,690
Ou Kexin.

540
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:55,940
Ou Kexin.

541
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,330
Ou Kexin.

542
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:03,810
A girl who grew up abroad alone.

543
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,190
Three years ago,

544
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,830
her face was disfigured

545
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,500
because of an accident.

546
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,840
She could have lived peacefully abroad.

547
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,750
But she came back because of a fire.

548
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:19,120
Don't you think it's too coincidental?

549
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:21,100
Isn't it too coincidental?

550
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,020
Many ordinary people would think

551
00:33:25,110 --> 00:33:26,560
that it's just a coincidence.

552
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:29,550
But to a man who loves making deductions,

553
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,250
this is not as simple as it looks.

554
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,660
Especially to me.

555
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,780
So I was thinking.

556
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:43,630
If the real Ou Kexin died three years ago,

557
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,440
then you...

558
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:50,190
You must be a fake

559
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:53,140
that the police use to replace Ou Kexin.

560
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:01,720
Am I right?

561
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,080
If all of my deductions are correct,

562
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,500
then you're my bargaining chip.

563
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,460
The police won't dare to touch me.

564
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,320
But if you're the real one,

565
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,000
your dad

566
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:26,090
will definitely help me and my family.

567
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,400
So tell me.

568
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:34,409
Are you the real Ou Kexin?

569
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,190
Or are you a fake?

570
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,460
I should at least know

571
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,050
who will be helping me in the end.

572
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:57,110
Don't worry, Zheng Ke.

573
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:59,130
You're still useful to them.

574
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,500
Nothing will happen to Xiaoxiao.

575
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:02,650
I understand.

576
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:04,150
Whatever it is,

577
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,260
we still have a tough fight ahead of us.

578
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,950
But who is our undercover agent?

579
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,630
[Family]

580
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,490
Tell them you're okay.

581
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,890
[Hello, Dad.]

582
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:42,300
[What are you doing?]

583
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:44,230
I'm with a friend.

584
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:45,990
Huang Boyuan.

585
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:47,090
[You know him.]

586
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,460
[Guanyin introduced me to him.]

587
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,710
Stop checking up on me all the time.

588
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:52,990
I'm fine.

589
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,410
Mu Qing still wants to see me later.

590
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,680
I'm busy.

591
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,310
I'll talk to you later, bye.

592
00:36:07,730 --> 00:36:09,220
Locate this number immediately.

593
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,500
[Is it done yet?]

594
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,480
I dare not do it.

595
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,720
[You loser. You can't even kill a man.]

596
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,800
What if Mr. Ou blames me for this?

597
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:31,090
He will kill me.

598
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,560
Nonsense. You won't be blamed for it.

599
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:34,960
Do it now!

600
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,420
Or else,

601
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,060
I'll kill you even if Mr. Ou doesn't!

602
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:40,820
I...

603
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,310
Fine.

604
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,480
Just wait. I'll be right there!

605
00:36:48,650 --> 00:36:52,430
I heard that before you work for Glasses,

606
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:54,370
you were a significant figure

607
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,510
at Baoqing Street.

608
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,180
How did you end up

609
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:58,410
working as Glasses's driver

610
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,830
and doing dirty work?

611
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,590
I'm indebted to Mr. Glasses.

612
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,010
He helped me when I needed help the most.

613
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:06,690
I'm repaying his kindness.

614
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,450
What's the point of telling you all this?

615
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,730
When Mr. Glasses is here, you're dead.

616
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,870
But I think

617
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,160
I'm not dying tonight.

618
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,090
Is Skylark in danger?

619
00:37:19,230 --> 00:37:21,070
[We have located Ou Kexin.]

620
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,700
[She's very likely with Huang Boyuan.]

621
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:24,020
We need manpower right now.

622
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,430
I'll make arrangements right away.

623
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:35,150
[Tracking]

624
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,540
[Who exactly are you?]

625
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:38,450
It's really important to me.

626
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,130
This concerns me.

627
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,170
It also concerns my parents' safety.

628
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,850
Please tell me.

629
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,080
I beg you.

630
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,930
Tell me who you really are.

631
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,290
Tell me!

632
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,590
I'm losing my patience.

633
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,850
So I can only use this

634
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:26,630
to help you tell me who you are.

635
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,960
Don't move!

636
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,370
Don't move!

637
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:44,720
Are you okay?

638
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,920
We have a long time ahead of us.

639
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:03,020
-Get up.
-Move.

640
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,690
Come on!

641
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,000
How are you? Are you all right?

642
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:23,520
I'm glad you got here quickly.

643
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:25,900
[Reporting to Captain Rong.]

644
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,440
[We've located the target.]

645
00:39:27,830 --> 00:39:29,550
[It's at a warehouse on Erhuan Street.]

646
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:30,960
Got it.

647
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:33,030
We found Mu Qing.

648
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,400
He's at a warehouse next to Erhuan Road.

649
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,650
I think I can keep him safe.

650
00:39:37,730 --> 00:39:39,320
You can take action when it's necessary.

651
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:41,340
If we alert them now,

652
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,850
it will affect our plan to catch Spectre.

653
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,450
Even if we fail to catch Spectre,

654
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,160
we will never

655
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,190
put our comrade's life at risk.

656
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,590
So...

657
00:39:52,210 --> 00:39:54,450
Since the higher-ups chose me
to carry out this mission,

658
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:57,050
they must have faith in my abilities.

659
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:58,850
I promise you.

660
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:00,970
If I can't take control of the situation,

661
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,680
I'll send you a signal right away.

662
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,050
You must succeed.

-Wait.

Sir, what does this mean?

668
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,450
Ruosheng begged me over and over again

00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,030
to spare your life.

670
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,220
I thought about it a lot.

671
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,540
I finally figured it out.

672
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,620
You're so cunning.

673
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,340
You fooled us all.

674
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,180
You won't walk out of here alive.

Godfather.

676
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:10,350
Didn't you promise me not to kill him yet?

677
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:11,850
You still haven't figured it out?

678
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,390
He's the mole.

679
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,680
Do you know why he targeted Kexin?

680
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:18,270
He's using Kexin as his shield.

681
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,240
Do you see it now?

682
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:20,340
Sir.

683
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,660
I'm not a mole.

684
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,240
When it comes to me and Kexin,

685
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:24,650
it was Kexin who approached me.

686
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,020
It has nothing to do with me.

687
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,520
That's just how she is.
You know that perfectly well.

688
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:29,840
Godfather, I can be his witness.

689
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,600
Kexin was the one who made the first move.

690
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:33,540
There's actually nothing
going on between them.

692
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:56,240
♫ It's pouring ♫

693
00:41:56,330 --> 00:41:59,720
♫ The cat is looking at you
from the lonely window ♫

694
00:42:01,430 --> 00:42:03,110
♫ In those eyes ♫

695
00:42:03,190 --> 00:42:06,190
♫ There are disappointment and memory ♫

696
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:09,930
♫ It's away from you ♫

697
00:42:10,010 --> 00:42:13,180
♫ Half a teardrop away ♫

698
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,540
♫ So much intimacy ♫

699
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:19,430
♫ Is being remembered ♫

700
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,570
♫ You that I love ♫

701
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:26,820
♫ Seem to melt in my night ♫

702
00:42:28,540 --> 00:42:30,250
♫ The pain becomes a sigh ♫

703
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,200
♫ Carved onto the pillows as tears ♫

704
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,070
♫ I miss you ♫

705
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:40,730
♫ You stay silent in my breath ♫

706
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:44,380
♫ Lie with me as you fall asleep ♫

707
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,580
♫ Until I wake up from my dream ♫

708
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,290
♫ The most romantic oblivion ♫

709
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:54,760
♫ Is to grow old together ♫

710
00:42:54,850 --> 00:42:58,150
♫ The longest love ♫

711
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,860
♫ Is not to be heard from ♫

712
00:42:59,950 --> 00:43:02,280
♫ I still don't want to believe ♫

713
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,970
♫ So I won't give up ♫

714
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:08,580
♫ So I cry under the fireworks ♫

715
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:11,790
♫ So I'm afraid to be reminded ♫

716
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,620
♫ That I miss you ♫

717
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,860
♫ Maybe I'm still in love ♫

718
00:43:17,950 --> 00:43:19,620
♫ I'm still moved by your words ♫

719
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:22,220
♫ I'm still holding your letters ♫

720
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:24,640
♫ Until my thoughts turn to ashes ♫

721
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,800
♫ Tears become shooting stars ♫

722
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:32,250
♫ To prove the greatness of love ♫

723
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:35,590
♫ The most romantic oblivion ♫

724
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,980
♫ Is to live the way you live ♫

725
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:42,280
♫ The longest love ♫

726
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:44,040
♫ Is when things remain unchanged ♫

727
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:46,550
♫ I'm still waiting for you ♫

728
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:49,100
♫ So don't worry ♫

729
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:52,710
♫ So you become a secret ♫

730
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,700
♫ So I try to be happy ♫

731
00:43:55,790 --> 00:43:59,090
♫ Because of you ♫

732
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,780
♫ So I'm afraid to be reminded ♫

733
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:06,480
♫ That I miss you ♫
