53

Okay, I understand.

54
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,620
What did you say?

55
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,520
All of them are gone?

56
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,410
The police suddenly barged
into the factory.

57
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,730
We couldn't hold them back.

58
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,310
They killed Fengzi too.

59
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:34,590
What about Linda?

60
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,170
She was arrested by the police.

61
00:07:41,010 --> 00:07:43,250
How did the police know?

62
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,670
How did the police know?

63
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,310
What's this, Guanyin?

64
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,590
Mu Qing.

65
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,920
It's too much of a coincidence.

66
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:04,550
Stop pretending.

67
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,570
You're the mole.

68
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,180
I'm the mole?

69
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,330
If I were the mole,

70
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:13,610
the police would've rushed in now
and I would be gone.

71
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,760
Why would I stay with you?

72
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:15,730
Calling me the mole.

73
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:18,010
That's enough. Let's go and meet Mr. Ou.

74
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,790
Guanyin.

75
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:22,630
Use your brain.

76
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,270
According to what you just said,

77
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,300
if you make Mr. Ou think I'm the mole,

78
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,370
based on our current relationship,

79
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,640
aren't you a mole too?

80
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:32,440
Even if you weren't a mole,

81
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,200
why did you get close to me?

82
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:41,240
Leave us.

83
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:43,440
Leave us!

84
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,590
Yes.

85
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,150
Then tell me.

86
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,400
What should I do now?

87
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,840
Guanyin.

88
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,730
As a person destined for great things,

89
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:05,660
you can't be swayed by others.

90
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:07,160
You must be patient.

91
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:10,990
At this point,

92
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,500
I only have one solution.

93
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,860
Director Liu.

94
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,840
We can't keep wasting time like this.

95
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,310
Liu Qingqing

96
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,080
is our only breakthrough right now.

97
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,550
If she doesn't identify Tieguanyin,

98
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,700
we can't arrest her.

99
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,180
She's having a nervous breakdown.

100
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,940
Persuading her takes time.

101
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,050
I tried. She won't budge.

102
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,600
Besides, we don't have time.

103
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,730
If Tieguanyin gets away, then...

104
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:51,990
Director Liu.

105
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,450
Let me try.

106
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,310
Go on. Strategize well.

107
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,670
Got it.

108
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,730
No one here will hurt you.

109
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:19,670
You can relax.

110
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,750
Liu Qingqing.

111
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,560
Born into a fairly well-off family.

112
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,800
Before high school,

113
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,510
you were always top of the class.

114
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,360
After you studied abroad,

115
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,210
you changed when you returned.

116
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,320
What changed you?

117
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,590
What have you been through these years

118
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,100
that you would get hooked on drugs?

119
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:48,400
Maybe...

120
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,800
Maybe you had your reasons.

121
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:57,020
But now that things have come to this,

122
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,970
there's no turning back for you.

123
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,580
Do you agree?

124
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,460
Can you tell us

125
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,390
everything you know?

126
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,800
In your world,

127
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:33,370
you're well aware

128
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,820
that you're doing bad things.

129
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,240
But you've never felt

130
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,380
that you're a bad person.

131
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,240
So...

132
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,200
Through various analyses,

133
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,140
I'm sure

134
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,650
you didn't come this far voluntarily.

135
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,830

136
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:55,890

Or is it...

141
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,510
Tieguanyin?

142
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,000
She threatened you with drugs

143
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,380
and made you work for her, didn't she?

144

148

I'm a victim too.

152
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:55,420
Tieguanyin used drugs to control me.

153

She threatened me to work for her.

154

She threatened my family.

Have you ever taken drugs?

156
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,260
Do you know how hard it is to quit drugs?

157
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,910
I tried to quit, but I couldn't!

It's my choice.

161

Since I started this business,

313
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,910

to overcome all obstacles.

315

I would end up in this pathetic state.

317
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:09,110
Guanyin, don't think too much.

318
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,970

Otherwise, I would've been
arrested by the police.

I believe you would make the same choice.

347
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:05,150
Speaking of choices,

if you were given another chance,

349
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:11,050

Yes.

Why?

355
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,390

Sir.

404
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,230
Before this, Tieguanyin asked

Coincidentally,

Why do you say that?

421

So many things happened in one night.

My thoughts

are the same as yours.

425
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:32,620
Something is fishy
about Tieguanyin's case.

426
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:35,740
If there's a mole in the group,

427
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:38,780
then the mole

428
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:41,150
is definitely...

429
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,090

You know everything I do.

If there's a mole,

434

then it's definitely not me.

Where's the evidence?

448
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,990
You tied me up here for no reason.

449
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,800
This is a clear violation of citizenship.

450
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,120
I have a right to sue you!

451

Based on what you're saying,

452
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,770
you're not admitting your crime.

453
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:32,120
Why would I admit to dealing drugs?

454
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,630
Not only did I not sell drugs,

455

460
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:48,620

I want my lawyer!

463
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,940
You have the right to get a lawyer.

464
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,410
But not now.

465
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:00,890
I'm Yao Yuan.

466
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:02,040
This is Tiannan.

467
00:33:06,170 --> 00:33:08,240
So you're both police officers.

468
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,360
We meet again.

469
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,560
Let's get acquainted.

470
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,490
I'm Rong Yao.

471
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,140
Rong Yao.

472
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:25,440
I got it.

473
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,730
It goes without saying

474
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,400
that Mu Qing is your undercover agent.

475
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:33,720
Am I right?

476
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,280
That's none of your business.

477
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,100
If I knew this would happen,

478
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,960
that day,

479
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,600
I should have killed you guys!

480
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:50,660
Speak properly!

481
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:54,350
We can stop beating around the bush.

482
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,290
If we don't have proof,

483
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:58,180
we wouldn't have brought you in.

484
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,640
Tell us.

485
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,150
Mr. Ou.

486
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,410
Glasses, Dakun, Congtou, and Spectre.

487
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:07,680
Tell us everything you know.

488
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:11,600
If you're good,

489
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,150
look it up yourself.

490
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:16,260
Okay.

491
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,370
I'll start first.

492
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,350
It's just a heads-up.

493
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,770
We got confirmation

494
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,550
that Mr. Ou is negotiating a big deal

495
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:26,510
with Spectre.

496
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:28,230
The goal

497
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,120
is to get the raw materials
for the new drugs.

498
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:33,860
It can lower the cost without relying
on the traditional production method.

499
00:34:33,989 --> 00:34:35,139
They can even secure

500
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:36,630
the source of goods in their hands.

501
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,389
So here's my advice.

502
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,600
Think about what will happen
to the drug dealers.

503
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:46,530
If you keep doing this,

504
00:34:46,969 --> 00:34:48,070
is it worth it?

505
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,550
If you start to cooperate with us now,

506
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,830
maybe you could

507
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:54,810
get yourself out on probation.

508
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,030
I'm sleepy.

509
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,020
I want to sleep.

510
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,420
Looking at Tieguanyin's reaction,

511
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,660
she must know Spectre's existence.

512
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,860
But she doesn't know
the transaction details

513
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:12,100
between Spectre and Mr. Ou.

514
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,260
So trying to get Spectre's secret from her

515
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,630
is impossible.

516
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:18,960
The rest of us should focus

517
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,720
on other people from Group K.

518
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,000
They are more likely

519
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,140
to know Spectre's secret.

520
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,720
I don't understand.

521
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,320
Tieguanyin already got away.

522
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:28,640
Why did she show up

523
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:29,870
in front of the bureau?

524
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,470
Could it be magic?

525
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,690
He's really doing some magic tricks.

526
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:38,720
Aren't you tired?

527
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:43,820
Li Yimeng.

528
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:44,830
Yes.

529
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,720
Please always keep our discipline

530
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,400
in mind.

531
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,600
Get back to work.

532
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,000
The lid...

533
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:53,460
Yimeng.

534
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:55,610
I'll tell you. Come on.

535
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:56,710
Stop it.

536
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:43,090
[Congtou, stop pacing. Let's play.]

537
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:44,670
[All you do is have fun.]

538
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,680
[Look at the situation.]

539
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,130
[Isn't it boring?]

540
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:56,500
Hey.

541
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,670
Stop looking. There's no lady in there.

542
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,740
Dare to play one round?

543
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,600
Congtou.

544
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,060
I forgot.

545
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,120
He doesn't want to play with us.

546
00:37:12,390 --> 00:37:13,710
He likes to play with ladies.

547
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,720
Congtou.

548
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,840
Excuse me.

549
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:23,340
Thank you.

550
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,190
How is it going

551
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:44,950
with you and Qingqing?

552
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:50,230
[Are you leaving? Where are you going?]

553
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:52,030
[I'm going to the bathroom.
Stay out of it.]

554
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,230
[Godfather said
you can't leave this place.]

555
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:55,810
[Congtou, I'll keep an eye on him.]

556
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:56,870
[Hey!]

557
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,770
What do you think?

558
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,980
Sir.

559
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:09,410
The mole is a serious matter.

560
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,950
I dare not speak.

561
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:13,720
It's not that you don't dare.

562
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:14,780
You just don't want to.

563
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,670
You're too careful.

564
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:18,390
Who can hear you from here?

565
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:20,370
I...

566
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,030
In my opinion,

567
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,940
Mu Qing and Li Ruosheng

568
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:34,400
are just trying to make the best of it.

569
00:38:35,110 --> 00:38:36,340
Out of the three,

570
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,890
only Congtou is putting up an act

571
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,900
and fidgeting.

572
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:43,470
He also directly pointed out my concerns.

573
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,660
Why is that?

574
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,290
I think

575
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:49,580
Congtou has been with you for so long,

576
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:51,210
so he knows how you think.

577
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,660
Otherwise,

578
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,730
he's guilty.

579
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,920
Feeling guilty

580
00:39:00,930 --> 00:39:02,740
doesn't mean that he's the mole.

581
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,600
Due to what happened

582
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,870
to Dakun and Tieguanyin,

583
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,470
he's afraid I would suspect him.

584
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:11,450
He's eager to prove himself

585
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,900
and afraid of getting into trouble.

586
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:14,260
That's human nature.

587
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,760
On the other hand, Mu Qing and Li Ruosheng

588
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:23,150
don't seem to care about the mole.

589
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:25,440
I can't tell.

590
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,380
Are they instinctively ignoring it?

591
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,180
Or are they trying to hide and avoid it?

592
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,130
How can the relationship

593
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,670
between those two get to this point?

594
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:35,160
Did you ask them clearly?

595
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,920
Yes.

596
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,400
It's because of that woman, Linda.

597
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:18,850
Hey!

598
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:21,760
I'm talking to you.

599
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:23,520
Don't you have ears?

600
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,150
Don't pretend to act cool.

601
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,370
There's a camera near the sink.

602
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,650
Darn it.

603
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,590
Even the bathroom isn't safe.

604
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,600
What happened to Tieguanyin?

605
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,200
It happened so suddenly. How would I know?

606
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:50,220
Were you really
with Ou Kexin at that time?

607
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:54,050
Are you suspecting me?

608
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,060
