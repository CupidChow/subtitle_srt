3
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,340
Search this place.

4
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:37,060
This way.

5
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,520
-Captain Rong.
-How is it?

6
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,880
I found nothing.

7
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,950
What about you?

8
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,140
I've looked everywhere.

9
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:56,810
There's no place to hold a hostage here.

10
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,950
Let's search the yard.

11
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,000
Basement, secret door.

12
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,240
Even the manhole cover!

13
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,040
-Yes.
-Let's go.

14
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,160
Where's the other person?

15
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,870
Who?

16
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:25,370
It's just the three of us.

17
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:27,390
Three people eating four meals?

18
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,400
Are you bluffing me?

19
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,990
Let me ask you again.

20
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,350
Where's the other person?

21
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,020
Can't I have two servings?

22
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,500
Cuff him.

23
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,590
Wait!

24
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,480
Did I commit a crime?

25
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,200
Did I obstruct you in your investigation?

26
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:45,520
Why are you arresting me?

27
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:47,320
It's a law-governed society.

28
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,079
I'll report you!

29
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:51,370
I have thousands of followers on Weibo.

30
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,650
I'm not afraid of you.

31
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,270
Put your phone down.

32
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,900
Don't hinder us from doing our duty.

33
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,910
I won't.

34
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,890
Aren't you public servants?

35
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,310
I'll do you a favor today.

36
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,280
Let people see

37
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,600
how the people's public servants

38
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,880
strictly enforce the law!

39
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,000
It hurts!

40
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,980
-The officer is hitting me!
-Stop!

41
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,080
Keep an eye on him.

42
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:13,850
Over there!

43
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,480
Stop!

44
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,550
-Stay and keep watch!
-Okay!

45
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,420
Xiaowei, get in.

46
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,230
Thank you.

47
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,120
How nice.

48
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,390
Here.

49
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,110
Drink some water and calm your nerves.

50
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:26,820
Thank you for saving me.

51
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,470
How are you going to thank me?

52
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:33,680
Right now,

53
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,350
I'll consider you my boss.

54
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,050
You're too young to be saying that.

55
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,590
I'm not Mr. Dakun.

56
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:44,510
I want to know.

57
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:47,540
Why were you at that cold chain storage?

58
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,110
The cold chain storage

59
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,870
was Dakun's turf, wasn't it?

60
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,409
I went to claim the turf.

61
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,460
What's wrong?

62
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:57,180
That was Mr. Dakun's hideout.

63
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,200
You couldn't have possibly found it.

64
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,720
Every single one of his properties

65
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,040
belongs to the group.

66
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,800
Regardless of how well hidden it is,

67
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,250
it’s clearly written

68
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,750
on this receiving checklist.

69
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,020
How could I not know?

70
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,300
You're taking over the place?

71
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,400
You can't do that.

72
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:13,850
Mr. Dakun said

73
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,610
I'm in charge of that place now.

74
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,640
I was going to manage it myself.

75
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,290
You're quite ambitious.

76
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,400
Since you consider me your boss now,

77
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,520
I might consider

78
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,280
letting you take over the turf.

79
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,830
But before that,

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,460
I need to see how good you are.

81
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,770
Right.

82
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:40,820
Why would you end up

83
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:42,140
luring the police to that place?

84
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,800
Don't ask something you shouldn't know.

85
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,700
Look at you.

86
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:50,020
You just said I'm your boss.

87
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,470
And now, you're turning against me.

88
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,280
What's wrong? Are you hurt?

89
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,180
What's that smell?

90
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,370
What got on it?

91
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,100
Don't get me started.

92
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,160
In order to avoid the cops,

93
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,270
I knocked over several bottles
of nutrient solution.

94
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,900
Darn it. Such bad luck.

95
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:19,890
You're quite an interesting man.

96
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,790
Are you keeping plants in the storage?

97
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,340
I can't keep any plants
in that run-down storage.

98
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,990
It's not like
you can keep someone in there.

99
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,390
I didn't say anything.

100
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,020
Xiaowei, be honest with me.

101
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,180
I just took over the turf.

102
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,470
I won't allow anything shady
going on there.

103
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,720
Is someone in there?

104
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,909
Mr. Dakun told me not to say anything.

105
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,720
This is a secret between me and him.

106
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,680
A secret?

107
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,900
Surviving on the nutrient solutions alone?

108
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,630
This person must be very sick.

109
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:06,670
For some reason,
he can't go to the hospital.

110
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,250
You can't let him die

111
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,750
and you need him alive.

112
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,210
This is not an ordinary person.

113
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,150
Stop asking.

114
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,770
No matter how many times you ask,

115
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,870
I have no answer for you.

116
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,090
Did Mr. Dakun capture him?

117
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,520
I don't know if you understand.

118
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,070
If he doesn't get the nutrient solution,

119
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,360
this person is most probably...

120
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,400
Are you saying that he'll die?

121
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,320
Don't panic.

122
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,080
It's not your fault.

123
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,760
Breaking the nutrient solution

124
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,910
is an unforeseen circumstance, right?

125
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:47,230
But...

126
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:52,030
You're afraid that you'll hurt him.

127
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,680
I don't have anything against him.

128
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,800
He has been tortured so badly
that he's beyond recognition.

129
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:00,340
I feel bad for him.

130
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,620
How about this?

131
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,210
I'm taking over the turf now.

132
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,320
I don't want anyone

133
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,170
or anything shady going on there.

134
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,490
It will bring bad luck.

135
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,100
I'll get you some nutrient solution.

136
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,390
Let's go there together and rescue him.

137
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,510
But I gave Mr. Dakun my word.

138
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,200
I can't tell anyone where he is.

139
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,920
I know where he is now.

140
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,640
He's in the storage, isn't he?

141
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,800
I'm talking about the specific location.

142
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,170
I'm not afraid
even if the police show up there.

143
00:09:38,050 --> 00:09:38,970
Why?

144
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,970
I hid him well.

145
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,840
You can't even tell me?

146
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:54,510
How about this? I won't force you.

147
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,570
Since you won't let me in,

148
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,330
I'll just wait outside.

149
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,790
Go in there and get him out.

150
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:00,930
That won't do.

151
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,470
The police are watching.

152
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:05,860
Xiaowei.

153
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,750
I'm your boss now.

154
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,510
You must listen to me.

155
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,360
You only have these two options.

156
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,160
Choose one. Think carefully.

157
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:20,950
Don't you know

158
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,450
how to serve drinks to your boss?

159
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,330
Give it to me.

160
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,280
Where's the patient you mentioned?

161
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,750
I'm asking you a question.

162
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,640
Here it comes.

163
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:11,470
What's this?

164
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,040
Dakun designed this.

165
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:17,370
If something happens to Dakun,

166
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,230
the bomb will begin a countdown

167
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,950
and detonate automatically.

168
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,630
I don't know the passcode.

169
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,300
That’s why he's kept

170
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:28,280
in the container of this truck.

171
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,970
He'll be sent out in the morning
and brought back at night.

172

that you don't know about me.

468

Like what?

469
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,310
For example,

470
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,300
I love poetry.

471
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,730
"All the earth and air.

472
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,800
With thy voice is loud,

473
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:27,920
As, when night is bare,

474
00:30:28,010 --> 00:30:29,770
From one lonely cloud,

475
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,590

476
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,100

Do you love this poem?

478
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,520
If you know this poem,

479
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,720
we should be the same kind of people.

480
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,880
So...

481
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:56,960
So you are...

482
00:30:58,770 --> 00:30:59,870
So I'm thinking

483
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,800
you should spend more time
getting to know me.

484
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:03,120
Because once you get to know me,

485
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:05,190
you will discover
that I have many good qualities

486
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,380
that you're not aware of.

487
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:08,270
You might fall even deeper
in love with me.

488
00:31:16,670 --> 00:31:17,640
Well...

489
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:19,270
I don't like this poem.

490
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:20,550
But I read it before.

491
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,130
You're overthinking it.

492
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,890
Are you a man or what?

493
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,390
I just confessed my feelings.

494
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,670
Don't you get it?

495
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,160
How lame.

496
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,360
Drink up, come on.

497
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:48,350
I'm a man, all right?

498
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:52,360
Here, have some food.

499
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,340
Don't just drink.
It's bad for your stomach.

500
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:55,700
I'll take one.

501
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:02,610

Where are you delivering the food?

505
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,970

506
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:33,980
