"The road ahead is long,

106
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,430
I shall search the way out."

107
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,570
What does that mean?

108
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,600
I'll put it in a simpler way.

109
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,630
It's like a doe

all it can do is to keep on running.

113
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,460
If it turns around,

114
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,720
death will be waiting for it.

115
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,190
Are you planning to arrest Congtou?

116
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,780
Yes.

117

[Police for the public]

119
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:29,000
to threaten Congtou to stay in Group K,

120
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,540
which means

121
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:33,010
Congtou is ready to leave Group K.

122
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,870
So the fact that Glasses kidnapped Xiaoyue

123
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:38,640
has made Congtou
more determined to run away.

124
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,840
Congtou is a romantic.

125
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:42,820
The fact that Xiaoyue is kidnapped

126
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,110
makes him want to leave Group K even more.

127
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,040
He might even hate Group K.

128
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,070
Following that train of thoughts,

129
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:50,740
as long as we have Congtou,

130
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,760
he will definitely speak the truth.

131
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,750
He will provide us
with more Group K's lawbreaking evidence.

132
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,170
He could even be our witness.

133
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,800
I know what you're thinking.

134
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,150
But I have a request.

135
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,010
Before we arrest Congtou,

136
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,680
we have to rescue Xiaoyue

137
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,220
and keep her under our protection.

138
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,640
She and her baby are innocent.

139
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,880
We can't let them get hurt.

140
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,040
Regarding this,

141
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,760
you can get Yuanwen and Rong Yu
to coordinate with you.

142
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,130
Got it.

143
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,970
Okay.

144
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:31,040
We'll save Xiaoyue first.

145
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,799
Then we'll work with Task Force 84

146
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,870
and wait for the chance to arrest Congtou.

147
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,770
As for the time and method,

148
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,309
we'll wait for your call.

149
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,330
This is going to be a difficult mission.

150
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,680
Glasses is keeping a close eye on Xiaoyue.

151
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,610
It's hard for us to make a move.

152
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:55,060
What's more,

153
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,130
even if we save her,

154
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:59,200
we have to find a place to hide her.

155
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:03,690
I have an idea.

156
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,550
This morning,

157
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,620
I let Congtou and Xiaoyue

158
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,820
talked to each other through a video call.

159
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,750
I think

160
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:14,510
he'll listen to us.

161
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,260
I want everyone to be happy as well.

162
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,210
But the circumstances don't permit it.

163
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,030
Spectre just sent a message.

164
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:35,100
He's arriving in Yungang soon.

165
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,520
At this crucial point in time,

166
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,900
no one in the group

167
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,790
can make any mistakes.

168
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,340
So I want you to keep a close eye

169
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:45,790
on Congtou and Xiaoyue.

170
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,090
Once we close the deal with Spectre,

171
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,430
it will be a complete comeback for us.

172
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,230
Got it.

173
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,690
Once the business stabilizes,

174
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,770
I want you to find a place

175
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,630
for Congtou and Xiaoyue to live in peace.

176
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,530
That's the least I can do for him

177
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,670
as an old friend.

178
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:15,140
Say that again.

179
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,780
You found out where Xiaoyue is?

180
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,320
Tell me. Where is she?

181
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,920
Congtou, calm down.

182
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,810
Mu Qing and I went to check on the place.

183
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,960
Do you know how many of Mr. Glasses's men

184
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,110
are keeping an eye on her?

185
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,780
If we barge in recklessly,

186
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:30,410
not only won't we be able to save her,

187
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:32,120
but we might also be risking our lives.

188
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,650
Then tell me. What should I do?

189
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,360
What should I do?

190
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,460
Congtou.

191
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,260
I have an idea.

192
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,680
Maybe we can get your wife out of there.

193
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,260
Ma'am, stop eating.

194
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,710
If you upset your stomach,

195
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,120
Mr. Glasses will scold me for it.

196
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,440
Give it to me.

197
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,440
Give it to me!

198
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:43,670
Order me a bowl of braised pork.

199
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,350
Braised pork.

200
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,710
Order it, hurry.

201
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:15,080
-That's my takeaway, right?
-Is it yours?

202
00:12:15,210 --> 00:12:17,110
It's mine.
I just called to rush the order. Look.

203
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,600
Isn't this Yuxiang shredded pork?

204
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,490
This is braised pork.

205
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:23,130
I'm sorry.

206
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,590
I'm mistaken.

207
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,080
What a nuisance.

208
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,210
When is my food coming then?

209
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,490
Here's your braised pork.

210
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,980
I want to go to the bathroom.

211
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:31,950
Go ahead.

212
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,160
[After five minutes,]

213
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,050
[go for a walk in the woods
near the villa.]

214
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,790
Why isn't she here yet?

215
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:22,680
Let's just wait.

216
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,700
Wait? What if they notice us?

217
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,680
Can we just wait a little longer?

218
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,170
Come on.

219
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,350
It's all my fault.

220
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:14,510
It's okay now.

221
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,060
It's fine. It's my fault, okay?

222
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,340
Let me introduce you.

223
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,960
This is Mu Qing.

224
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:21,370
This is Li Ruosheng.

225
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,260
Go with Mu Qing.

226
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,240
Li Ruosheng and I will protect you. Okay?

227
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,440
No, I want to go with you.

228
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,540
I promise.

229
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,260
You will be with me in no time.

230
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,980
Listen to me for now, all right?

231
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:36,200
Let's go.
Mu Qing, please take care of her.

232
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,300
Thank you.

233
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,460
Mu Qing, I'm counting on you.

234
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,240
Who did it?

235
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,460
Wait for me. I'll be there right away.

236
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,790
Sir, she...

237
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,210
You know what you have to do.

238
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,660
Mr. Glasses.

239
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:35,690
Why did you bring so many men?

240
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,190
Give me a call if you're coming next time.

241
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,650
I'll pick you up downstairs.

242
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,680
Congtou, Mr. Glasses is here.

243
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:45,500
You can just visit,

244
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,860
why do you have to bring

245
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:48,140
so many men with you?

246
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,430
Mr. Glasses, have a seat.

247
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,180
Where is she?

248
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,790
Who?

249
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,460
I'm asking you. Where is she?

250
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,010
And I asked, who are you referring to?

251
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:06,710
-Shao Nan, search this place.
-Search the place.

252
00:17:06,790 --> 00:17:07,720
Hold on.

253
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,460
Mr. Glasses.

254
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,190
You're welcome to visit my house.

255
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,829
But you brought so many men here

256
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,010
to search my house.

257
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,550
Does Godfather know?

258
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:21,010
What do you think?

259
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,859
Why don't you give your godfather a call?

260
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:29,010
Search the place!

261
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,080
Don't touch my bed.

262
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,560
Mr. Glasses.

263
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,240
I've been here since this morning.

264
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:38,560
For the whole morning,

265
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,540
I've been drinking

266
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:42,520
and playing cards with Ruosheng.

267
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,470
Look, the cards are still here.

268
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,930
Tell me. Who exactly are you looking for?

269
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,660
Don't play dumb.

270
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,950
Don't you know who I'm looking for?

271
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,310
I don't know.

272
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,420
Who exactly are you looking for?

273
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,630
There's no one.

274
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,480
There's no one here either.

275
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,890
There's no one, Mr. Glasses.

276
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,510
I'm sorry to interrupt, gentlemen.

277
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:19,880
Let's go.

278
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,960
What is it?

279
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,350
Are you leaving already?

280
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,250
Mr. Glasses.

281
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,490
Let me give you

282
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,830
a piece of advice.

283
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,770
Take good care of Xiaoyue for me.

284
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,800
Otherwise,

285
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,670
you'll never hear the end of it.

286
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,350
This is all thanks
to Mu Qing's thoughtfulness.

287
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,380
Otherwise, he would have caught us.

288
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,450
Glasses won't let this go so easily.

289
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,880
Xiaoyue isn't safe with Mu Qing either.

290
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,690
We have to inform Mu Qing.

291
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,100
Congtou, don't worry.

292
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,610
She's not with Mu Qing right now.

293
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,770
She's someplace safe.

294
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:41,930
Slowly.

295
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,610
You must be Xiaoyue, right?

296
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,410
You are...

297
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,560
I'm Ou Kexin.

298
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,710
You're Mr. Ou's daughter?

299
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:56,720
Don't worry.

300
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,210
We are two different people.

301
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,280
You're safe with us.

302
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,090
Trust me.

303
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,560
Come on.

304
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:19,990
Sir.

305
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,840
I've checked everywhere.

306
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,830
Congtou, Li Ruosheng, and Mu Qing.

307
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,940
None of them has made any move.

308
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:30,770
Their men are all on their own turfs.

309
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,220
No one went out.

310
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:36,580
Maybe Congtou hired an outsider to do it.

311
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,090
Anything that you can think of,

312
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,020
Congtou can too.

313
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:43,970
But...

314
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,080
I still have doubts

315
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,490
about Mu Qing and Li Ruosheng.

316
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,400
When we were at the old place,

317
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:52,460
they fell out with each other.

318
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,320
This play they put on

319
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:57,610
looks fake no matter how I look at it.

320
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:01,880
Fine, let's look into it again.

321
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:03,770
But what's most important

322
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,760
is you must find out where Xiaoyue is.

323
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,580
Understood.

324
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,620
Thank you for the trouble.

325
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,930
Ms. Ou, everything you asked me to buy

326
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:25,900
is all here.

327
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:27,180
I didn't miss a single thing.

328
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,690
Li Ruosheng, not bad at all.

329
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,620
You even got the right brands.

330
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,250
Am I a three-year-old?

331
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,890
Don't flatter yourself.

332
00:21:36,150 --> 00:21:37,780
That's a lot of stuff.

333
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,230
It's not much.

334
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,770
You will be staying here for a while.

335
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,410
No, I can't do that.

336
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,950
I don't want to trouble anyone.

337
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,980
Besides, you guys got me out.

338
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,650
I'm sure you want Congtou to be informed

339
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,060
so that he can come to pick me up.

340
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,090
I know that you're all good people.

341
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:54,900
But for me,

342
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,100
I want to be with my husband.

343
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,310
Ma'am.

344
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,770
Since you think we're good people,

345
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:04,880
then you should believe
that we won't harm you.

346
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,080
The main issue at hand

347
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:08,400
is we have to find a good way

348
00:22:08,490 --> 00:22:10,560
for you to meet Congtou.

349
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:12,060
The group has too many eyes.

350
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,820
It's too dangerous to go out now.

351
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,910
Then will Congtou be in danger too?

352
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,590
This is for you.

353
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,120
The group kidnapped you

354
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,720
to ensure Congtou doesn't leave the group

355
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,950
and continue doing his job.

356
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,980
Now, the group needs his help.

357
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,740
So his safety isn't a problem.

358
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,720
But if you insist on leaving,

359
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,390
you won't be safe.

360
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:41,450
This is the safest place

361
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,470
we could come up with.

362
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,750
Yes.

363
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,120
We're trying to figure out a safer way

364
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:49,240
to send you away later.

365
00:22:58,650 --> 00:22:59,620
Hello.

366
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:02,440
I'm telling you. I don't have much time.

367
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,130
[Bring Xiaoyue to Yangwan Pier now.]

368
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,170
I'll keep all my promises. Okay?

369
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,270
Your every move

370
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,630
is being watched by Glasses.

371
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,390
You won't be able to leave
without our help.

372
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,840
Don't bother if I can leave or not.

373
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:16,510
I'll leave if I can.

374
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,410
Otherwise, I'll fight with them. Okay?

375
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:20,610
[All of you already did your best.]

376
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,450
[This is no longer your business.]

377
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:25,750
I will take care of the rest.

378
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,480
Just bring Xiaoyue to me, okay?

379
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,240
Hello?

380
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,400
Was that Congtou?

381
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,670
What did he say?

382
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,990
Is he coming to pick me up?

383
00:23:35,210 --> 00:23:37,330
Hurry and think of a way to send me there.

384
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,310
You can't go out now. It's too dangerous.

385
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,640
Sir, the boat is ready.

386
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,180
Okay, got it.

387
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,910
I don't care if it's dangerous.

388
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,320
As long as I can be with him,

389
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,640
I'll do anything.

390
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,840
Please help me think of a way

391
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:00,910
to send me over there, okay?

392
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,920
Why don't the two of you

393
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:14,200
discuss it outside?

394
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,050
I'll keep her distracted.

395
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,160
It's tiring to create a fuss.

396
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:19,300
Let her rest for a while.

397
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,470
Have a seat.

398
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,660
Forcing Xiaoyue to stay

399
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,640
will alert Congtou.

400
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,970
It might also make Li Ruosheng suspicious.

401
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,600
Either way is not good.

402
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,680
But if we send Xiaoyue to Congtou,

403
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,060
we can't guarantee her safety anymore.

404
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,310
Besides, Director Liu
has emphasized it many times.

405
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,370
Our priority

406
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,780
is to make sure Xiaoyue is safe.

407
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,120
If Congtou is surrounded by Glasses's men

408
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,530
and things get out of hand,

409
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,770
we might end up hurting innocent people.

410
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,980
All right then.

411
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,960
We'll keep Xiaoyue here for now.

412
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,330
Let's figure out a way later.

413
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,700
[Hello.]

414
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,590
Congtou.

415
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:32,950
Where are you guys?

416
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,680
Are you on your way yet?

417
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:38,280
We're on our way.

418
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,080
What's going on?

419
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,140
What's wrong?

420
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:42,770
Did something happen?

421
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,000
What could go wrong?

422
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,190
Your wife is with us.

423
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,860
Don't worry. We'll be there in a bit.

424
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:49,320
[Why are you mumbling then?]

425
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,740
[Let me talk to Xiaoyue.]

426
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,510
Think about it, Congtou.

427
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,920
Let's all be honest.

428
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:57,860
Everything we did was for you

429
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,180
and your wife's own good.

430
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,070
[What do you mean for my own good?]

431
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,520
[I don't need your concern.]

432
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,500
[All you care for
are the raw materials I own]

433
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,040
and my business.

434
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,490
Stop beating around the bush.

435
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,560
Just tell me. Where on earth are you?

436
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,100
Where are we?

437
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,600
Li Ruosheng, give me the phone.

438
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,780
[Let me talk to Xiaoyue!]

439
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,140
Okay, Congtou.

440
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,090
Hello.

441
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,600
[Congtou, are you okay?]

442
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,800
I'm at Kexin's house.

443
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,470
[I'm safe.]

444
00:26:27,910 --> 00:26:29,980
Why are you still there?

445
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,430
[Didn't you all depart yet?]

446
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,910
Baby, put Ruosheng on the phone.

447
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,130
Congtou.

448
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:45,460
Ruosheng, I’m begging you.

449
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,720
[If you still respect me as a friend,]

450
00:26:48,810 --> 00:26:50,390
[can you bring her to me?]

451
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,620
I'm telling you.

452
00:26:51,710 --> 00:26:53,300
If you don't bring her here,

453
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,140
I'll pick her up myself!

454
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,210
But Congtou, right now...

455
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,520
Ma'am, where are you going?

456
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,340
I'm leaving.

457
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,810
Can you listen to me for a second?

458
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,480
You really can't leave right now.

459
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:15,030
Let's find another way to solve this.

460
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,440
What other way is there?

461
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,260
Wait, what do you mean?

462
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,620
What do I mean?

463
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,510
Glasses kidnapped me

464
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,230
for his business in Group K.

465
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,680
And your so-called "saving me"

466
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:26,960
is just the same as Glasses.

467
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,410
It's for your business too.

468
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,360
I'm not your tool.

469
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:33,340
That's why I must go.

470
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,370
-Ma'am.
-Don't touch me!

471
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,980
Okay, I...

472
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:41,210
I won't touch you.

473
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,760
Well, this is how it is.

474
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:45,660
You're pregnant.

475
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,500
If anything happens to you out there

476
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,040
and you don't see Congtou,

477
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,290
I won't know how to explain myself to him.

478
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,780
You're carrying a child.

479
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,320
I can't just watch you die.

480
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,390
Where are you going?

481
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,150
Anywhere is safer for me than here.

482
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,380
I knew it.

483
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,230
All of you are just like Glasses.

484
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,740
You're just using me and my baby

485
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,880
to threaten Congtou.

486
00:28:05,150 --> 00:28:06,110
I realize it now.

487
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:07,830
You need to know one thing.

488
00:28:08,050 --> 00:28:09,590
We're the ones who saved you.

489
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,220
We're also the ones protecting you.

490
00:28:11,350 --> 00:28:13,240
If you think we're the same as glasses,

491
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:14,250
you're free to go.

492
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,660
But you need to know one thing.

493
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,910
The people outside
are all spies sent by Glasses.

494
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,020
Don't think that both of you

495
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,250
can leave Yungang so easily.

496
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:24,200
That's not true. Congtou will protect me.

497
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:28,030
Protect you?

498
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,740
He can't even protect himself now,

499
00:28:29,830 --> 00:28:30,750
let alone you.

500
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,000
If you think he can carry you
and swim across the river,

501
00:28:33,090 --> 00:28:34,710
you might as well just drown in the river.

502
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,080
No one can help you now.

503
00:28:36,870 --> 00:28:38,810
Ruosheng, call Congtou.

504
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:39,770
Send her away.

505
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:42,410
For real?

506
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,690
We did all we could.

507
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,790
She just wouldn't listen.

508
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,850
Just call him.

509
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,930
Trust us, Xiaoyue.

510
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,180
Mr. Glasses.

511
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,900
Our guys by the pier

512
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,390
found a suspicious yacht.

513
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,280
It seems to be rented by Congtou's friend.

514
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:20,910
What friend?

515
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,190
Just a poor friend.

516
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,520
He recently received a large sum of money.

517
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,540
It was Congtou who sent him the money.

518
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,460
Mr. Glasses.

519
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,560
Do you think Congtou

520
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,840
is trying to play tricks?

521
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,950
Since Congtou wants to die,

522
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:42,960
we won't stop him then.

523
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,020
Mu Qing, you're quite a good cook.

524
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,640
Let's open a restaurant.

525
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,160
Here, ma'am.

526
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,320
What now?

527
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,860
She's pregnant.

528
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,760
And you used your chopsticks
to serve her food?

529
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:03,720
It's unsanitary.

530
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:04,740
I'm not sick.

531
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,640
You're really pissing me off.

532
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,740
Here.

533
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,690
Xiaoyue, drink this.

534
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,530
Trotter soup is very nutritious.

535
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:14,940
Have some.

536
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,220
Even if you don't want to eat,

537
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,550
you have to eat for the baby.

538
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:24,710
Why?

539
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,910
Babies need nutrition to grow, of course.

540
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,670
Why are you doing this to me?

541
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,370
We have a purpose.

542
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:35,230
Is that what you want to hear?

543
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,910
I just can't stand my dad

544
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,580
for doing that to you and Congtou.

545
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:40,900
I just want to take care of you

546
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:41,960
for a few days.

547
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,320
We will also think of a way

548
00:30:43,410 --> 00:30:44,380
to send you away.

549
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,180
Kexin is right, ma'am.

550
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:48,160
You have to eat, even a little.

551
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,630
You can't starve your baby. Am I right?

552
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:51,640
Have some soup.

553
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,880
Have some.

554
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,310
Go ahead.

555
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,380
[Mr. Glasses, you're right.]

556
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,400
[Congtou is at the pier.]

557
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:32,950
Sir.

558
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,370
Should we bring Congtou back?

559
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,240
Where's Xiaoyue?

560
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,610
[We haven't seen her yet.]

561
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,680
Here's what you should do.

562
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,140
If you see Xiaoyue,

563
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,300
bring both of them to me.

564
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,100
If she doesn't show up,

565
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,550
don't alert Congtou.

566
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,650
[Yes, sir.]

567
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,640
Sir.

568
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,730
I suspect Li Ruosheng and Mu Qing

569
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,270
are hiding Xiaoyue.

570
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,180
You just want my permission

571
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,820
to keep an eye on those two rascals.

572
00:32:22,850 --> 00:32:24,700
I have no choice.

573
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,470
I can't think of another way.

574
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:32,000
If it weren't for Spectre,

575
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:35,470
I wouldn't want to agree to this.

576
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,390
All right. Do as you wish.

577
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,260
Yes.

578
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,200
Hello.

579
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:01,170
Shao Nan.

580
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,120
Keep an eye on Li Ruosheng and Mu Qing.

581
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,750
If you see Xiaoyue and Congtou

582
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:07,020
contacting them,

583
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,830
call me right away.

584
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,850
Do you want me to check Ou Kexin as well?

585
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,480
Not yet.

586
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,720
It will be worse if she finds out.

587
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:17,360
Keep your eyes on those two rascals.

588
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:20,440
If we find out they're helping Congtou,

589
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,290
everything will be easier.

590
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,300
[Understood.]

591
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,820
I just want to know.

592
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,810
Am I the errand boy or the delivery guy?

593
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,260
How did I end up

594
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:43,540
becoming her grocery shopper?

595
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,210
You ate so much.

596
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,530
It's good for digestion.

597
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,500
Hurry up and go.

598
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:49,170
Ask her to text me everything she needs

599
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,320
all at once.

600
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,720
Don't make me do so many trips.

601
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,880
Okay, I'll ask her to do that. Go on.

602
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:13,860
Is she asleep?

603
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:15,400
Yes.

604
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,360
Take a look.

605
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,909
Glasses called me more than ten times.

606
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,090
I guess he still doesn't believe you.

607
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,790
It would be weirder
if he didn't suspect me.

608
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,790
My dad and Glasses

609
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,290
won't let this slide so easily.

610
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,659
I think

611
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:44,389
Xiaoyue is not safe with me either.

612
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:47,290
So you're saying

613
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:49,710
that we should send Xiaoyue away first?

614
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:52,130
Or let Rong Yao pick her up.

615
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:55,080
No. That's too dangerous.

616
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,929
Glasses is suspecting me.

617
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,250
I'm sure he suspected you too.

618
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:00,270
Sending her away
or getting someone to pick her up

619
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,590
is not a good idea.

620
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,670
I'm not questioning your ability.

621
00:35:11,930 --> 00:35:13,910
But we can't afford to make any mistakes.

622
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:18,670
I have to get what Congtou has right now.

623
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,130
It's not only so that Ruosheng and I

624
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,360
can take down Glasses,

625
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,810
but it's also for us to be able

626
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,130
to meet Spectre in the future.

627
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:29,450
[What Congtou has and to meet Spectre?]

628
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:31,290
[I knew it. They're just using me.]

629
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,850
So you're still worried.

630
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:37,810
I'm worried about you.

631
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:42,430
Worried about me?

632
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:43,970
I can't let anything happen to you.

633
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:50,130
Hello, Congtou.

634
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:51,230
Where are you?

635
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,280
What are you doing?

636
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,380
I've been waiting for you!

637
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,530
Calm down.

638
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,120
I'll go check.

639
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:58,660
I know.

640
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:00,600
I understand what you're saying. I...

641
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,420
Listen to me.

642
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:08,340
Let me analyze how high the stakes are.

643
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,740
[Don't talk about the stakes with me.]

644
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:13,800
[If you ask me,]

645
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,940
you just don't want to let

646
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,220
Xiaoyue and I leave, right?

647
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,020
If you think so,

648
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,520
you have really misunderstood us.

649
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,410
[Don't say I didn't warn you.]

650
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,780
[Glasses must be targeting you by now.]

651
00:36:23,870 --> 00:36:25,720
He's just waiting for us
to send Xiaoyue over

652
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,260
so that he can take us all at once.

653
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,280
If you don't believe me,

654
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,310
let's take the risk and try.

655
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:32,500
Why should I?

656
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,270
How do you want me to try?

657
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:44,240
Congtou, it's me, Mu Qing.

658
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,360
I have an idea. Do you want to hear it?

659
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,470
They really are running away.

660
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,360
Guys, let's go.

661
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:18,560
What do you want?

662
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,690
What are you doing here?

663
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,130
Congtou.

664
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:28,020
This is just a misunderstanding.

665
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:29,390
A misunderstanding, my foot!

666
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:32,990
Let me ask you.

667
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:35,110
Did Glasses send you?

668
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,310
Congtou.

669
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:39,810
I asked if Glasses sent you here!

670
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:56,710
On your knees.

671
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,860
I said get on your knees.

672
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,100
What did you say to me?

673
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,820
Repeat yourself in front of Mr. Ou.

674
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,430
Say something.

675
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,580
I said, talk!

676
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,610
Congtou, you went too far.

677
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:15,850
Why can't you say it nicely?

678
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,920
Am I not talking to him nicely?

679
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,510
I'm talking to him nicely now.

680
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:21,700
Explain yourself!

681
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,010
Sir, you're here too.

682
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,860
Let's get things sorted out today.

683
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,400
You mean

684
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:30,760
you want me to find a woman

685
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,080
to disguise herself as Xiaoyue.

686
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,670
Then bring her on board

687
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,220
and see if there's an ambush around me?

688
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,940
That's not all.

689
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:40,180
If Glasses's men take action,

690
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,590
it's as good as getting

691
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:42,860
one of Glasses's weaknesses.

692
00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:45,720
So I need you to turn this

693
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:47,920
against Mr. Glasses in front of Mr. Ou.

694
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,680
Get Mr. Ou to agree

695
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:51,580
to get rid of Mr. Glasses's surveillance.

696
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,200
That's the only way you can leave.

697
00:38:53,290 --> 00:38:56,110
At first, I thought it was strange.

698
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,920
My girlfriend was kidnapped by Glasses.

699
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,990
He threatened me to work with him.

700
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,630
I really thought that was your idea.

701
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:05,610
Why was I so foolish in the beginning?

702
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,280
I shouldn't have taken it seriously.

703
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:09,130
Sir.

704
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,260
Since you're here,

705
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,440
please tell me.

706
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,480
It wasn't your idea, was it?

707
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,720
Sir.

708
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,920
I, Congtou,

709
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:34,080
have been working for you for years.

710
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,590
All these years, just like you said,

711
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,010
we're friends

712
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,770
who went through thick and thin.

713
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,700
I don't believe that it was your idea.

714
00:39:50,310 --> 00:39:51,240
Congtou.

715
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:53,000
Can we talk outside?

716
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,890
Why can't we talk here?

717
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,660
Why can't we sort it out here?

718
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:01,530
Sir.

719
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,260
At this very moment,

720
00:40:04,350 --> 00:40:06,640
Glasses is still holding

721
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,220
my girlfriend hostage.

722
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,320
He kidnapped her

723
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:10,730
and forced me to work with him.

724
00:40:10,820 --> 00:40:12,530
He kidnapped my girlfriend.

725
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:14,510
He's the one causing trouble.

726
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,750
Sir, say something.

727
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,550
Can I have my girlfriend back?

728
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,010
My girlfriend is pregnant with my son!

729
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:24,550
What's the matter?

730
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,580
You don't want to work with Glasses?

731
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,590
I never said I didn't want to.

732
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,180
The new factory has been set up.

733
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,680
Glasses also have the power

734
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,000
to distribute the goods.

735
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:43,510
What else can I do
if I don't work with him?

736
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,440
My girlfriend and my son's life

737
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:46,720
are in his hands.

738
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:48,350
I can only cooperate with him.

739
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,770
Then why were you anxiously waiting

740
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:52,440
on a yacht by the pier?

741
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,910
Sir.

742
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,160
Are you suspecting

743
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:05,020
that I was trying to run away?

744
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:06,700
Am I wrong?

745
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:10,960
You know what they say.

746
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,750
God is above everyone.

747
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,080
The heavens know everything we're doing.

748
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:18,440
I, Congtou,

749
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:21,040
swear to the heavens today.

750
00:41:21,390 --> 00:41:23,240
If I'm planning to run away,

751
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:24,430
I'll die a horrible death

752
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,840
and be struck by lightning.

753
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:29,490
What about that woman just now?

754
00:41:33,010 --> 00:41:37,800
