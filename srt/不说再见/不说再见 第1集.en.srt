A bomb?

You guys have less than five minutes.

7

I'll give you a choice.

8
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,230
Give me money

9
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,460

Otherwise,

11
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:05,320
you'll blow up along with this bomb.

12

Can you defuse it?

13

You don't believe me?

14

15

-Tell me, how much do you want?
-Tell us.

16

Give me 100,000 yuan each.

17

Also, give me back the money you took.

18

I'll give you whatever I can.

19

Defuse the bomb.

20
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,920
I'll give you a more lucrative tip.

21
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:20,890
Go and save Mr. Li.

22
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:22,920
I'm sure he can give you more.

23

Where is Mr. Li?

24
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:28,420
Mr. Cao kidnapped him.

25
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,820
Where did he go?

26
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,100
My watch has his location.

29
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,000
I know, Mr. Cao.

30
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,510
I know you want the goods, right?

31
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,790
How about this?

32
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,500
Let me go first.

33
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,530
Everything can be discussed later, okay?

34
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,380
We'll talk about it later.

35
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,800
I told you to call him now!

36
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,730
You bet on the wrong one.

37
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,740
I...

38
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,720
Mr. Ou is my godfather.

39
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,090
But we're really not close.

40
00:04:14,310 --> 00:04:16,200
Using me to threaten him is no use.

41
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:20,550
Okay.

42
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,850
I think your hands

43

-Chop it off.
-I'm sorry, Mr. Cao.

I'm sorry!

Let's go.

59

Mr. Cao.

60
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,100
Without a strong mindset,

61
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,170
I wouldn't dare to do business with you.

62
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,840
The rules are the same.

63
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,280
Are five bags sufficient for you?

64
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,340
Mr. Cao.

65
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,320
Not five bags.

66
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,590
It's 50% off.

67
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,270

68
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,440
Can we talk nicely?

69
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,450
The market is very bad recently.

70
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:02,070
I'd like Group K to show me some respect.

71
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:05,460
Mr. Cao, your respect should be

72
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:07,790
measured in catties.

73
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,480
Our goods are measured in grams.

74
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:12,810
It's not the same.

75
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,880
You'll suffer losses sometimes.

76
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,120
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

77
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,780
What are "losses"?

78
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,280
Is it tasty?

79
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,060
What is this, Mr. Cao?

80
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,980
You came all the way here with this.

81
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,659
I can't let you return empty-handed.

82
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,350
I run a business.

83
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:50,080
It's all about integrity.

84
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,460
Unlike you.

85
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,150
I'm not done talking to you.

86
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,690
Yet you wanted to leave.

87
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,760
Do you know the drill?

88
00:08:02,130 --> 00:08:03,280
Where is your integrity?

89
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,140
I don't see it, Mr. Cao.

90
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,050
Those who break the rules

91

will get kicked out.

92

Are you sure you want to pay
for your mischief?

93
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:16,260
You're Mr. Ou's godson.

94
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:18,370
Is your life more valuable

95
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,840
or are your goods more valuable?

96
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,640
Mr. Cao, I told you.

97
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,760
Mr. Ou wouldn't answer my calls.

98
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,470
As his godson, I mean nothing to him.

99
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,190
We're really not that close.

100
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,790
Mr. Ou's company is very big.

101
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,420
He has the Four Vajras by his side

102
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:15,920
and so many men working for him.

103
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,240
And you're the only one

104
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:18,380
who calls him godfather.

105
00:09:18,950 --> 00:09:20,930
If I tell you the truth,
don't laugh at me.

106
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,160
I lied to you that Mr. Ou is my godfather.

107
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,270
I did it to live a better life

108
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,460
and not get bullied.

109
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,800
I swear that every word I said is true.

110
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,480
I have only met Mr. Ou a few times.

111

00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,580
I almost died!

175
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,030
Look at him.

176
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,100
Zhao Yun from Changshan.

177
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:08,820
He fought seven rounds

178
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,360
and single-handedly saved his master.

179
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,320
What is this called?

180
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,420
It's called loyalty!

181
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,140
Do you know where you're lacking?

182
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,460
Here!

183
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,220
IQ.

184
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,410
EQ.

185
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,980
Are you sick?

186
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,980
Well, the one Zhao Yun
saved single-handedly

187
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,960
was Liu Adou.

188
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:28,920
What do you mean?

189
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,420
This Adou

190
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,400
is the Adou who can't support Adou.

191
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,160
It's not the one you meant.

192
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,230
Who exactly is he?

193
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:41,900
Did I allow him to talk?

194
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,220
Sir.

195
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,110
He's a security guard at one of our turfs.

196
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,610
He's usually quiet.

197
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,850
It's normal that you don't remember.

198
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:49,910
I wanted to ask you.

199
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,190
I got in the car and thought,

200
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:52,590
how did he become a driver?

201
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,130
I told you last time

202
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,630
about hiring a driver.

203
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:58,450
Didn't Qiangzi...

204
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,410
All right, shut up.

205
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,330
A security guard.

206
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,590
Are you trained?

207
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:07,950
I trained when I was a kid.

208
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:08,920
Okay.

209
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,160
Why did you risk your life
to save me today?

210
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,530
I need money.

211
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:13,580
Money?

212
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:14,680
I'm afraid of poverty.

213
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:16,880
When there's a chance to earn more money,

214
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,600
I won't let it slide.

215
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:19,830
Then how do you get a chance

216
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,590
to earn more money?

217
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,560
By saving your life.

218
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:24,540
How did you know saving me
will earn you money?

219
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,550
The captain said it.

220
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,050
Do you know what kind of business we do?

221
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:32,850
It's pretty obvious.

222
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,610
Then let me tell you something.

223
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,900
I won't give you money.

224
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:40,200
I'll give you a twist instead.

225
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,830
What will you do?

226
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,240
I just want the money.

227
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,080
The captain also agreed

228
00:15:45,170 --> 00:15:46,710
to give me my share.

229
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,470
I'm sure Mr. Li isn't the type

230
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,320
to owe others money, right?

231
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,340
What did I teach you?

232
00:15:56,660 --> 00:16:00,090
Don't make promises so easily.

233
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,500
Am I right?

234
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,040
Give it to him.

235
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,760
Seriously?

236
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,220
Give it to him.

237
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,820
The password is the last six numbers.

238
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,970
Thank you, Mr. Li.

239
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,340
You didn't even ask the amount

240
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,300
before thanking me.

241
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,980
Whatever amount you think it's worth,

242
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,210
I'll accept it.

243
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,230
What can I say if I'm not satisfied?

244
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,370
Buddy.

245
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,220
I have to be honest with you.

246
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,470
Actually, I'm kind of annoyed

247
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,700
by your persistence.

248
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,460
But I like your boldness.

249
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:37,400
If you're willing to work with me,

250
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:39,560
I promise you'll earn more.

251
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,840
I'll even put your abilities to good use.

252
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,120
I do need money,

253
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,700
but not to the extent

254
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:46,240
where I'm willing to do anything.

255
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,660
For things I shouldn't know,

256
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,420
I don't want to know or get involved.

257
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:53,060
I'm just a security guard

258
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,120
at one of your turfs.

259
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,830
I'm working part-time as a driver.

260
00:16:58,030 --> 00:16:59,000
Today,

261
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,210
you absolutely saved me.

262
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,550
If there's nothing else, I'll go.

263
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:13,790
What's his name?

264
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,130
I think...

265
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,540
What do you mean by "I think"?

266
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,880
Dig up everything about him now!

267
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,380
One more thing!

268
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,839
Gather up all the boys

269
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,130
and capture Mr. Cao!

270
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,270
Director Liu.

271
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,400
It's such an important mission,

272
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,940
but it took you so long to inform us.

273
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,180
I've been watching Li Ruosheng
for so long.

274
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,980
I didn't want to let go of this chance.

275
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:02,490
This is Mr. Cao's gun.

276
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,020
Good job.

277
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,320
Li Ruosheng is doing

278
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,720
a background check on you.

279
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,850
But your fake identity is fine.

280
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:19,920
From now on,

281
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,380
you're Mu Qing.

282
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,330
"Mu Qing"?

283
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,500
That's easy to remember.

284
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,140
It's more westernized than Liu Yuanwen.

285
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,440
Yuanwen.

286
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:37,870
Your undercover mission with Group K

287
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,110
has officially started.

288
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,000
Next,

289
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:43,940
you have to wait patiently for Li Ruosheng

290
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,180
to invite you to join them.

291
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:49,220
Get closer to their core.

292
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,370
Capture Ou Zhenhai,

293
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,000
their so-called evidence

294
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,280
of Mr. Ou's crimes.

295
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,520
Lastly, we'll finish them up
with the organization.

296
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,800
Although Li Ruosheng is Mr. Ou's godson,

297
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,450
his power and status within Group K

298
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:07,920
is the same as an ordinary lackey.

299
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,380
So using him to get

300
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,880
to the very core of this power

301
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,900
might take more time.

302
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,670
There's no rush. Take your time.

303
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,590
It's not hard to find Ou Zhenhai.

304
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,090
However,

305
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,900
gathering evidence of his crime

306
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:26,530
won't be easy.

307
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,020
Everything must be done with extreme care.

308
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,290
Do you understand?

309
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,210
This is for you.

310
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,820
What is this?

311
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:41,670
Is this a gift?

312
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,640
Isn't this design a bit old-fashioned?

313
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,670
That's enough. I'm leaving.

314
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,080
Boss, here.

315
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,020
Xiao Wen!

316
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,590
You guys are good.

317
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,700
You managed to find such a remote place.

318
00:20:40,050 --> 00:20:42,600
It's fate.

319
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,140
It's fate.

320
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:48,760
You guys are spying on me.

321
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:49,730
No.

322
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,470
It's called "following."

323
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:54,750
-Yes.
-If you follow back,

324
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,710
that would be great.

325
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,690
We need to know where you are

326
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,980
so that we can deliver the money to you.

327
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:00,950
Am I right?

328
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:02,090
Okay.

329
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,910
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Li.

330
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:05,880
You're welcome.

331
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,370
What is this?

332
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,700
Don't eat this.

333
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,720
Let's go. I'll treat you to a huge meal.

334
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,570
Consider it a token of my gratitude.

335
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:17,930
I love eating this.

336
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,710
-Bring it along then.
-Okay.

337
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,470
Come on.

338
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:24,050
Get in.

339
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:31,930
Mr. Li.

340
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,210
Hot pot in the early morning?

341
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,810
Who says we can't have a hot pot

342
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,040
in the early morning?

343
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,150
Here, wipe your hands.

344
00:21:41,390 --> 00:21:42,270

Yes!

and told me to maintain the status quo.

Why didn't you tell me sooner?

In the end,

He doesn't treat me like his godson.

641
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:50,120
Initially, you're his godson in name only.

642

Dakun is in charge of sales.

658

It's only natural

659
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,160
that he takes over the new turf.

660
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:32,800
All he needs is to whisper unheeded advice

661
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,980
to Mr. Ou.

662

Does that mean we're working for him?

Exactly.

666

The most important thing is

667
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,890
we need to speak to Mr. Ou directly.

668
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,610
We must take control.

Taking advantage of this perfect market,

675

he's selling some shoddy goods

676
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,450
at a cheap price.

677
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:08,350
He took business away from the group.

678
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,680
Recently, Dakun is having a hard time too.

679
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:12,660
So you're thrown under the bus.

680
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,420
Isn't he just a tyrant?

681
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:16,790
He's scared of Scorpion.

682
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,890
But he isn't scared of me.

683
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,890
Mr. Ou didn't know about this, right?

684
00:40:21,330 --> 00:40:22,950
You've never told him about your hardship.

685
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,160
Shall we fight?

686
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:37,430
Fight! We must fight!

687
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:40,550
But how do we fight?

688
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,440
Overthrow Scorpion.

689
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,300
Just the two of us?

690
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:47,770
Dakun left him alone

691
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,820
for us to take the risk.

692
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,500
If we take Scorpion out

693
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,090
and claim his turfs as our own,

694
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,070
we can expand our power.

695
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:58,330
Besides, we can snitch on Dakun

696
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,690
in front of Mr. Ou.

697
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,190
Kill two birds with one stone.

698
00:41:15,930 --> 00:41:16,900
Goodbye, Mr. Mu.

699
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,180
Taxi.

700
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,670
Taxi!

701
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:41,840
Taxi!

702
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:52,140

703
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:07,490
♫ In the evening, by the serene beach ♫

704
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:14,450
♫ From my camera,
you're looking at the shore ♫

705
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:21,490
♫ I hope our hearts will never sway ♫

706
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:28,480
♫ I want to fill my world up with you ♫

707
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:35,740
♫ If love is
the destination of wandering ♫

708
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:42,430
♫ Your smile blurs my sight ♫

709
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:49,600
♫ At this moment, I am lost for words ♫

710
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:52,370
♫ Close your eyes slowly ♫

711
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:56,860
♫ And let me kiss the edge of your nose ♫

712
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:02,230
♫ The wind blows past me as I zone out ♫

713
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,530
♫ When I turn around,
I lose you in the midst of a crowd ♫

714
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:09,050
♫ You are a teardrop away ♫

715
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:12,790
♫ And I shall quietly wait ♫

716
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,220
♫ If love never leaves us ♫

717
00:43:16,310 --> 00:43:19,740
♫ This beautiful encounter ♫

718
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:22,950
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

719
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,400
♫ Say goodbye ♫

720
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:40,820
♫ The wind blows past you
as you zone out ♫

721
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:44,470
♫ Suddenly, I realized ♫

722
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:47,900
♫ What we experience is love ♫

723
00:43:47,990 --> 00:43:51,510
♫ And time is my love confession ♫

724
00:43:51,590 --> 00:43:54,980
♫ If love ever comes ♫

725
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:58,590
♫ It's the sweetest thing
I look forward to ♫

726
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:01,630
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

727
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:04,840
♫ Say goodbye ♫

728
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:10,290
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

729
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,610
♫ Say goodbye ♫
