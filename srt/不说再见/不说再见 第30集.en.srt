This mole will destroy the entire Group K.

4
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,280

6

7
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,870
Hello.

8
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,320
Shao Nan.

9
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,540
Bring the girl to the fishing port.

10
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:08,340

11

12

13
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,710
I can't believe it.

14

Let's hope so.

19

Did you think

20
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,290
Liu Qingqing would take the blame for you?

21
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,800
You threatened her with drugs.

22
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,260
No matter how much drugs she sells,

23
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,850
she's just an accomplice.

24
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,440
But you're the prime culprit.

25
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,380
Besides,

26
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:00,430

what will happen to the rest of my life.

34
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,050
Since the day I started this business,

35
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,400
I've treated it

36

41

00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,620
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

171
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:40,940
♫ Say goodbye ♫

172
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,800
♫ The wind blows past you
as you zone out ♫

173
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,200
[Yuanwen, you're too close to her.]

174
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,450
♫ Suddenly, I realized ♫

175
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,620
[Remember, you're an undercover agent.]

176
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,750
♫ What we experience is love ♫

177
00:14:58,710 --> 00:14:59,640
[So is she.]

178
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,440
♫ And time is my love confession ♫

179
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:08,920
♫ If love ever comes ♫

180
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,350
♫ It's the sweetest thing
I look forward to ♫

181
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:15,430
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

182
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,510
♫ Say goodbye ♫

183
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:24,280
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

184
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:28,460
♫ Say goodbye ♫

185
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,180
I'm so sorry.

186
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,200
Our bathroom is quite far away.

187
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,830
I don't know what's going on.

188
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,770
I always feel the urge
to go to the bathroom.

189
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,950
I couldn't hold it in.

190
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:46,760
Why don't you go and take a rest

191
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:47,990
at the resting area in front?

192
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:50,450
It's okay. I haven't been out in a while.

193
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,170
I want to shop around more.

194
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,140
Sure.

195
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:54,110
Look at these.

196
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,160
All of these

197
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,880
are our new lumbar support mattresses.

198
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,640
They're very effective

199
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,350
in protecting your back and neck.

200
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,890
This is our bestseller.

201
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,090
Its quality is definitely worth its price.

202
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,070
Jingmian 6926.

203
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,670
This suits me.

204
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,790
The color and size of the headboard

205
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,890
are customizable.

206
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,350
You really know how to promote.

207
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,370
Also, this is anti-dust mites.

208
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:18,530
It's really good.
Watch your steps. Have a try.

209
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:20,730
How is it? Does it feel good?

210
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:21,690
It's soft.

211
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,190
Yes, it's really comfortable.

212
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,690
Maybe I'll get one.

213
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,830
You'll have this one?

214
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,730
-Great. I'll get your bill.
-Sure.

215
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,370
Congtou.

216
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,300
Congtou.

217
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,720
When did you come?

218
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,350
I just arrived.

219
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,670
Slowly.

220
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,870
I'm telling you.

221
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,410
That mattress I just bought

222
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,680
is perfect for me.

223
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,740
It's 2,000 yuan cheaper

224
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,100
than the one from earlier.

225
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,200
Sure, let's buy it.

226
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,220
Here, I'll help you to sit down.

227
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,630
Slowly.

228
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,380
It's not easy to come out.

229
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,260
What's wrong?

230
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,300
I opened an account for you overseas.

231
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:23,030
And in this account,

232
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,520
I've saved some money for you.

233
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,369
What's wrong with you today?

234
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,620
Nothing.

235
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,000
Actually, I've planned for this long ago.

236
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,470
But it took some time

237
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,790
to exchange foreign currencies.

238
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:37,770
I was just informed today.

239
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,220
The transaction is complete.

240
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,380
So I'm letting you know.

241
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:43,440
Why are you telling me this
all of a sudden?

242
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,450
Well...

243
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,230
We may have to move to a new house.

244
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:57,570
Where are we moving to?

245
00:17:57,920 --> 00:18:00,070
We'll move

246
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:01,880
to a more comfortable place.

247
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,890
After all, you just bought

248
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,570
a new mattress.

249
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:09,970
You can use it in the new place.

250
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,380
Did you do something bad again?

251
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,150
Or are you hiding something from me?

252
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:19,300
Nothing happened.

253
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,240
Don't think too much.

254
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,530
It's true. I'm not lying.

255
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,390
Here.

256
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,180
Recently,

257
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:40,030
because of Xiaoxiao,

258
00:18:40,290 --> 00:18:42,230
everyone has been working really hard.

259
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,850
I am really thankful.

260
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,970
I will never forget.

261
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,680
I won't say too much.

262
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,310
Let me drink to all of you, okay?

263
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,550
-Sure, cheers.
-Here, drink up.

264
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,520
Cheers.

265
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,250
We're all family.

266
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,200
Besides, saving Xiaoxiao
is such a big deal.

267
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,260
We're all willing to help, right?

268
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,020
The person I should
praise the most is you.

269
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,780
You accomplished your mission

270
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,190
even under so much stress.

271
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,960
If it were us,
we probably wouldn't be able to do it.

272
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,200
We should learn from you.

273
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,160
I know, right?

274
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,440
With my hot temper,

275
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:13,290
I might have made things worse.

276
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,930
We're all glad that Xiaoxiao is all right.

277
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,200
From now on,

278
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,740
just seek help when you need it.

279
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:20,860
We'll help if we can.

280
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:24,460
If we can't even help ourselves,

281
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,780
how can we help others?

282
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,630
What's more,

283
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,440
from Dakun to Tieguanyin,

284
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,500
we're slowly dissolving Group K

285
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:32,650
layer by layer.

286
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,450
This calls for a celebration. Here.

287
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:36,390
Let me make a toast to everyone.

288
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,240
Here.

289
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,950
Captain Rong has made a request.

290
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,150
Let's drink more with him. All right?

291
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,780
-Here, Captain Rong.
-Bottoms up.

292
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,110
Let's not talk about unhappy things.

293
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,830
Let's only talk about happy things.

294
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,070
I got you the best liquor from my place.

295
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:51,790
A jar of fine-quality Hongtan.

296
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,250
Let's drink to our heart's content.

297
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,660
-Okay?
-Come on.

298
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,550
Yi Meng, drink up.

299
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:04,590
Mr. Spectre.

300
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,000
I didn't expect

301
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:07,450
to get a call from you this late.

302
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,510
What's wrong?

303
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,490
Are the raw materials for your new product

304
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,500
ready to ship?

305
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,480
[You know very well.]

306
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:15,020
[This new batch of raw materials]

307
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:17,390
[are something
I've been researching for years.]

308
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,200
[It's my life's work.]

309
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,220
[I'll only give it]

310
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,510
[to the most capable dealer.]

311
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:25,180
What's the matter?

312
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:26,370
You sound like

313
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,480
you're worried about my group's abilities.

314
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:30,290
Money isn't a problem.

315
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,060
[I know you have money, Mr. Ou.]

316
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:34,730
[I'm confident that my new product]

317
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,710
[can sell for a good price.]

318
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,510
[I'm talking about abilities]

319
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,100
[that are more important than wealth.]

320
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,530
Mr. Spectre.

321
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:45,860
Our group controls most of the market

322
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,270
in the Asia-Pacific region.

323
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,730
I believe we can make the most profit

324
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,450
if we work hand in hand.

325
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,610
[You're right.]

326
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,890
[That is also what I value the most]

327
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,390
[about your company.]

328
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,240
[But there's one thing.]

329
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,040
[Security.]

330
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,680
[You're experienced in this business.]

331
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:05,840
[I'm sure you know what I mean.]

332
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,920
[I want long-term prosperity.]

333
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:09,970
[I want to replace]

334
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,340
[all other stocks on the market]

335
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,050
[with my new product.]

336
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,040

00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,140
[I'm confident about the latter.]

339
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,160
[As for the former,]

340
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,230
[I'm still quite worried.]

341
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,240
I understand.

342
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,940
Did you hear any rumors recently

343
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,300
that made you scared?

344
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,950
[Better safe than sorry.]

345
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,060
[To avoid any accidents,]

346
00:21:36,370 --> 00:21:38,480
[I'll go to Yungang myself.]

347
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:39,720
You're always welcome here.

348
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:42,000
Come anytime. I'll treat you well.

349
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,940
Yes.

350
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,170
Sure.

351
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,620
Qingqing, here.

352
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,050
I'll help myself.

353
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,370
I'm glad you know.

354
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,200
My dad moved two weeks ago.

355
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,610
But I haven't heard from him.

356
00:22:03,870 --> 00:22:05,280
Is he abandoning me again?

357
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:09,200
Besides, Mr. Glasses had caused

358
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,470
such big trouble lately.

359
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,540
How is my dad going to clean up his mess?

360
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,740
That's why Godfather told Mr. Glasses

361
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,060
to not spread words.

362
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,470
They must be doing a big business.

363
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:21,870
"Big business"?

364
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,470
You're just a woman.

365
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,650
You shouldn't ask so much.

366
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,890
It's better not to know

367
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,210
about things like this.

368
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,710
It hasn't been easy for Godfather lately.

369
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,390
Go home and see how he's doing.

370
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:37,880
If I didn't care about him,

371
00:22:37,970 --> 00:22:39,110
why would I concern myself

372
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,170
with all this nonsense?

373
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,800
Stop being arrogant.

374
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,870
Be like Mu Qing.

375
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:45,980
Do something helpful for my dad.

376
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:56,140
Does Mu Qing have this?

377
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:01,330
What is that?

378
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:05,950
It's his new address.

379
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,540
Godfather asked me to give it to you.

380
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,970
Why didn't you take it out earlier?

381
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:11,940
You're so rude.

382
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:13,740
New address.

383
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,940
I should bring him some food as I visit.

384
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,600
I'll go cook something.

385
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,650
What's going on?

386
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,100
Do you need my help?

387
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,700
I don't know

388
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,060
how I can help Godfather either.

389
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,130
Things are pretty intense lately.

390
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,890
Spectre is coming soon.

391
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:43,310
Spectre?

392
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:47,970
Big international player.

393
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,040
Hardly anyone has seen him.

394
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,840
Spectre is just a nickname.

395
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,620
Godfather takes his new product
very seriously.

396
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:58,400
So he told us not to spread

397
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,030
anything unfavorable for the group.

398
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,390
Otherwise, it's over.

399
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,580
Then you should be careful
for the time being.

400
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,700
We would rather do nothing.

401
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,280
Don't be like Mr. Glasses,

402
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,690
causing so much trouble.

403
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:12,920
I know that.

404
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,960
I should take these few days off,

405
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,550
get some rest, and enjoy life.

406
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,020
When is Spectre coming?

407
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,570
I don't know the exact time.

408
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,510
But Godfather is on his guard

409
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:30,690
at all times.

410
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,580
Then you will be able to relax

411
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,850
for a few more days.

412
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,350
Come with me to the clubhouse.

413
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:45,210
Forget it. I'm not going.

414
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,210
To you,

415
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,360
caution is eating and having fun.

416
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,900
But to me,

417
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,630
caution is doing nothing at all.

418
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,480
How boring.

419
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,430
I met Congtou yesterday.

420
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,050
He moved away too.

421
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,000
We didn't talk much.

422
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:05,720
But from what he said,

423
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,230
what happened to Tieguanyin

424
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,850
seems to have a big impact on him.

425
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:12,710
What are you trying to say?

426
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:15,220
He sounded very weird when we talked.

427
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,450
He said he doesn't know

428
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,040
how long this will last.

429
00:25:19,010 --> 00:25:20,330
He sounded like

430
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,730
there's no future for the company.

431
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:24,200
He was very pessimistic and negative.

432
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:26,350
He looked troubled.

433
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,930
It looks like Congtou

434
00:25:31,150 --> 00:25:32,950
is planning something big.

435
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,720
Stay vigilant these couple of days.

436
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,310
Don't ruin Mr. Ou's business.

437
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:38,940
At this point,

438
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,830
I won't let my guard down on anyone.

439
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,130
One more thing.

440
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,330
Once Glasses has his own factory,

441
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,870
he'll definitely work with Congtou.

442
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,320
Know your enemy

443
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:50,770
and you will never lose a battle.

444
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,720
You're up to something.

445
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,270
What did I do?

446
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,720
You want to go after him.

447
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,280
Don't you want to?

448
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,490
Yes, I really want to.

449
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:06,610
Leave Congtou to me then.

450
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,060
He's gone.

451
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:38,770
I knew it.

452
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:39,960
Spectre is coming.

453
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:42,340
What's meant to come will come.

454
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,850
I'll report to the higher-ups later

455
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:46,650
that Spectre is coming to Yungang.

456
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,880
How about this?

457
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,860
Go back to your dad's first.

458
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:52,150
Collect information on Spectre

459
00:26:52,370 --> 00:26:53,290
and wait for a chance

460
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,970
to take over Mr. Ou's business.

461
00:26:56,510 --> 00:26:58,530
I'll just stay here.

462
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,200
I'll work with you from the outside.

463
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,140
If anything were to happen,

464
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:03,330
let's meet again anytime.

465
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,510
I'll go after I cook.

466
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:09,000
Also,

467
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,720
even though it's very normal

468
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:12,040
for you to go to your dad's,

469
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:14,770
but you must make Mr. Ou think

470
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:16,570
that everything happens naturally.

471
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:19,080
That way, he won't be wary of you.

472
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,970
So that we can achieve our goal.

473
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,130
You're good.

474
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,800
You're bold and meticulous.

00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,390
Where are you going, Ms. Ou?

509
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,760
-Go away.
-Ms. Ou.

510
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,640
Mr. Mu, what's wrong with Ms. Ou?

511
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,570
She's always so capricious.

512
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:53,540
Who can stand it?

513
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:17,260
Dad.

514
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:27,380
This place looks fine.

515
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:30,110
I'm sure there's a blue moon in the sky.

516
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,270
Ms. Ou actually cooks for her dad?

517
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,170
Tell me. What do you want this time?

518
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,300
Don't talk like that.

519
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:47,880
What do I want from you?

520
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,290
This is my house.

521
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,830
Can't I come back to see you?

522
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,380
Besides, I've never been here before.

523
00:29:53,470 --> 00:29:54,660
I just want to know

524
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,110
if you're living comfortably here.

525
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,580
As long as you leave me alone,

526
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:00,990
I'm comfortable anywhere.

527
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,220
Tell me.

528
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,980
Did you argue with Mu Qing again?

529
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,180
Don't mention him.

530
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,670
It annoys me.

531
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,180
See?

532
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,190
So I am right.

533
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,920
This brat really doesn't know his place.

534
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:19,120
You defended him
and kept him company every day

535
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,350
when he got caught.

536
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,630
What's the matter?

537
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,390
Did he forget about what you did for him?

538
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,100
Should I get someone
to teach him a lesson?

539
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,470
Then why are you here?

540
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,700
What am I doing here?

541
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,460
I'm here to visit you
and keep you company.

542
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:35,140
I'm here to bring you food.

543
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,820
I'll heat up the food for you now.

544
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,000
It won't take long.

545
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,130
Dad.

546
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,420
Look what I made for you.

547
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:57,880
It's white fungus lotus seed soup.

548
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,420
Try it.

549
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,310
Let me try.

550
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:12,800
What do you think?

551
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,010
It's good.

552
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,030
It's even better

553
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,400
than the one Fushun is selling.

554
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,510
You're getting good at cooking.

555
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,360
If you like it,

556
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:25,070
I'll cook for you every day.

557
00:31:28,950 --> 00:31:31,280
It's good to have my daughter around.

558
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:32,510
Of course.

559
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,650
You always locked yourself

560
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,490
in the study last time.

561
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,500
Why do you still do the same here?

562
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,160
My study may look small.

563
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:48,880
But it has everything.

564
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,550
I can take care of all my personal

565
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,050
and business matters here.

566
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:55,700
Also, not everyone can come in.

567
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,380
Am I just anyone?

568
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,980
You're different.

569
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,430
You're my daughter.

570
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,880
No one can stop you.

571
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,380
That's enough. Don't fill yourself up.

572
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:11,050
It will upset your stomach. Give me.

573
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,420
Let's go. I'll take you upstairs.

574
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,750
-Be good and come with me.
-Okay.

575
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,170
Boss.

576
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,620
He's coming out.

577
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,260
Follow him.

578
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,889
Keep your distance.

579
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,080
Yes.

580
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,690
Not bad, Congtou.

581
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,490
You have a wife at home

582
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,900
and a mistress too.

583
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:48,140
You even bought your mistress a house.

584
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:51,570
This is interesting.

585
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,550
Boss.

586
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,920
We see a few suspicious men.

587
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,030
I see them too.

588
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,600
I tailed him the whole day

589
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,490
and only got this.

590
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:24,050
I don't think his mistress

591
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,850
can help us in anything.

592
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:30,340
You've known Congtou for a long time.

593
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,710
Have you heard him mention this woman?

594
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:33,770
No.

595
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,720
The villa is so secluded.

596
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,390
I'm sure Congtou doesn't want others

597
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,620
to know about this.

598
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,700
On top of that, this woman is pregnant.

599
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,460
I'm sure it's not that simple.

600
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,920
Then analyze it.

601
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,510
What does this all mean?

602
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,000
What happened to Dakun and Tieguanyin

603
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,450
must have affected Congtou.

604
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,190
Maybe the past consecutive events

605
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:00,740
are starting to make Congtou nervous.

606
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,690
No wonder.

607
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,160
Aside from me,

608
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,650
there were others watching him.

609
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,250
When I followed him to the villa,

610
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,400
I saw other cars at his door.

611
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,570
I can't be sure of who they are right now.

612
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,300
But I think they're plotting on Congtou.

613
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,130
Isn't it obvious who they are?

614
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,550
Among the Four Vajras,

615
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,660
Glasses and Congtou are the only two left.

616
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,990
If a fight between them breaks out,

617
00:37:33,610 --> 00:37:35,630
I'm sure it will be more interesting
than we thought.

618
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,360
At a time like this,

619
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:40,470
an opportunity like this may be risky,

620
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,320
but we must work harder.

621
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,440
Go ahead.

622
00:38:03,530 --> 00:38:05,290
Did you see the woman
in the photo I sent you?

623
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,610
Run a background check on her

624
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,620
as soon as possible.

625
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,950
[She is Congtou's Achilles' heel.]

626
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,530
[We can make use of this weakness.]

627
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,480
Things are chaotic within the group now.

628
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:16,990
Congtou's stance is vague.

629
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,300
Maybe he's an easy target.

630
00:38:21,650 --> 00:38:22,620
I got it.

631
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:26,270
I hope it will be a big breakthrough.

632
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:28,830
Yuanwen.

633
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,500
Hang in there.

634
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:33,490
You'll be returning soon.

635
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,770
Stay safe.

636
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,350
Okay.

637
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,620
Aren't you going on a business trip?

638
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,340
Why did you come without telling me?

639
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,860
I miss you.

640
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,170
I haven't seen you in a few days.

641
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,380
I've been feeling

642
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:10,800
very uneasy recently.

643
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,060
Where else can I go?

644
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:15,820
Ever since I got together with you,

645
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,580
I haven't even gone home.

646
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,220
I have no family or friends.

647
00:39:21,270 --> 00:39:23,340
I'm even pregnant now.

648
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,040
Did I put you through a hard time?

649
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,120
I'm willing to do so.

650
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:40,810
Sir.

651
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,100
Have you heard from Spectre?

652
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:45,600
No.

653
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:48,550
He's taking his time to choose
who he wants to work with.

654
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,140
We're the one who's being chosen.

655
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:52,290
I feel that we're very passive.

656
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,970
If Spectre comes to Yungang,

657
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,780
he might find out

658
00:39:56,870 --> 00:39:58,450
the internal problems of our group.

659
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,470
In that case,

660
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,790
it will affect our partnership.

661
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,110
That will be a problem.

662
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:06,590
Should we prepare for it in advance?

663
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,770
That's not important.

664
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:12,880
Most importantly,

665
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,510
if he really comes,

666
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,710
don't let him return empty-handed.

667
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,220
I tell you what.

668
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,890
Get some foreign cash ready

669
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,960
from the underground bank.

670
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,920
Prepare around a 10% deposit.

671
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,160
I need to close the deal
even if I had to lie.

672
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,350
Understood.

673
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:34,970
Sir.

674
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:37,520
I've been meaning to apologize to you

675
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:38,750
for what happened earlier.

676
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:40,910
Please forgive me.

677
00:40:41,310 --> 00:40:43,680
I'll work harder from now on.

678
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,890
Why are you telling me this now?

679
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,080
Get to work.

680
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:49,580
Yes.

681
00:40:58,770 --> 00:40:59,960
Mr. Glasses.

682
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,470
Kexin, you're still awake.

683
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,320
-Are you guys talking about business?
-Yes.

684
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:13,290
Dad.

685
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:15,450
Look.

686
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,430
I told you I'll cook for you every day.

687
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:18,570
Here.

688
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:20,110
Another one?

689
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:29,220
What do you think?

690
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,490
Eat up. I'm going to bed.

691
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:35,510
-You should too.
-Okay.

693
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:07,370
♫ It's pouring ♫

694
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:10,840
♫ The cat is looking at you
from the lonely window ♫

695
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:14,100
♫ In those eyes ♫

696
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:17,220
♫ There are disappointment and memory ♫

697
00:42:19,330 --> 00:42:21,010
♫ It's away from you ♫

698
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:24,390
♫ Half a teardrop away ♫

699
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:28,620
♫ So much intimacy ♫

700
00:42:28,970 --> 00:42:30,470
♫ Is being remembered ♫

701
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,650
♫ You that I love ♫

702
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:38,030
♫ Seem to melt in my night ♫

703
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:41,250
♫ The pain becomes a sigh ♫

704
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:44,370
♫ Carved onto the pillows as tears ♫

705
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,150
♫ I miss you ♫

706
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,850
♫ You stay silent in my breath ♫

707
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:55,460
♫ Lie with me as you fall asleep ♫

708
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,700
♫ Until I wake up from my dream ♫

709
00:42:59,070 --> 00:43:02,590
♫ The most romantic oblivion ♫

710
00:43:02,670 --> 00:43:05,930
♫ Is to grow old together ♫

711
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,270
♫ The longest love ♫

712
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,120
♫ Is not to be heard from ♫

713
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:13,140
♫ I still don't want to believe ♫

714
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:16,000
♫ So I won't give up ♫

715
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:19,440
♫ So I cry under the fireworks ♫

716
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,780
♫ So I'm afraid to be reminded ♫

717
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:26,560
♫ That I miss you ♫

718
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:28,850
♫ Maybe I'm still in love ♫

719
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:30,520
♫ I'm still moved by your words ♫

720
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:32,900
♫ I'm still holding your letters ♫

721
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:35,720
♫ Until my thoughts turn to ashes ♫

722
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,930
♫ Tears become shooting stars ♫

723
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:43,370
♫ To prove the greatness of love ♫

724
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:46,630
♫ The most romantic oblivion ♫

725
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:49,970
♫ Is to live the way you live ♫

726
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:53,320
♫ The longest love ♫

727
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,120
♫ Is when things remain unchanged ♫

728
00:43:55,210 --> 00:43:57,500
♫ I'm still waiting for you ♫

729
00:43:57,580 --> 00:44:00,090
♫ So don't worry ♫

730
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:03,570
♫ So you become a secret ♫

731
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:06,910
♫ So I try to be happy ♫

732
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:10,170
♫ Because of you ♫

733
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,690
♫ So I'm afraid to be reminded ♫

734
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,380
♫ That I miss you ♫
