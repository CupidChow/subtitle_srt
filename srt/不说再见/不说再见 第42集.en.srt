3
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,080
What do you want to do then?

4
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,410
Are you going to give me back

5
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,509
the things I gave away?

6
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:40,620
I did think about that.

7
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,729
What about Mu Qing?

8
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,200
Just leave him be.

9
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,479
My thoughts are his thoughts.

10
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,729
Mr. Glasses, you're right.

11
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:51,220
I was just lucky.

12
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,759
I met Mu Qing.

13
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,740
He supported me single-handedly.

14
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,900
In the end,

15
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,920
I'm still his boss.

16
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,640
You're so sure.

17
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:03,500
Will he listen to you?

18
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,350
I'll make him listen to me.

19
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:08,690
Ruosheng.

20
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:10,630
You...

21
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,560
Normally,

22
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:14,230
you look mean.

23
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,360
But you're a big softy.

24
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:20,000
And in this line of work,

25
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,810
being softhearted is the worst weakness.

26
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:24,790
You'll harm yourself and others.

27
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:29,550
Ruosheng.

28
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,540
The things I gave away.

29
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,030
There's no reason to take it back.

30
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:35,180
I told you.

31
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,040
I don't want to live those days again.

32
00:02:38,829 --> 00:02:40,240
Now that I'm done,

33
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:42,829
I've never thought of making a comeback.

34
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:45,520
You can tell that to Mu Qing.

35
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,630
So he won't have to send you again

36
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,790
to see what I have to say.

37
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,890
That's not true.

38
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:53,920
As for Shao Nan, I've sent him home.

39
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,290
Right now,

40
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,650
I have nobody by my side.

41
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,250
Kill me if he wants.

42
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:00,480
But

43
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,540
I have one wish.

44
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,920
Protect Mr. Ou.

45
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,500
Take care of the group.

46
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,790
My years of blood and tears

47
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,420
won't be wasted then.

48
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,329
Is that what Glasses said?

49
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,300
That's right.

50
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:45,930
I don't know why.

51
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,950
When I met Mr. Glasses today,

52
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,760
I feel like he was particularly lonely.

53
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,350
I feel like he got older.

54
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:56,360
If he's taking a step back
to take two steps forward,

55
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,250
isn't the step too further back?

56
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,030
Glasses really sent Shao Nan back

57
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,570
to his hometown.

58
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,240
I knew you were worried.

59
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,270
I told them to keep an eye on him.

60
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,110
Apart from surfing the Internet,

61
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,740
he'll treat his friends to a meal.

62
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,940
I didn't notice anything dubious.

63
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,399
Regarding this,

64
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,810
we can't take this lightly.

65
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,040
Keep following him.

66
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,400
If you're worried,

67
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,600
just get someone to kill him.

68
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,670
Don't worry.

69
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:28,830
Even if I have to kill him,

70
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,370
I'll do it when I get back.

71
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:31,950
When you get back?

72
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,590
Where are you going?

73
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,670
I'm going to see Matsumoto.

74
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,220
Spectre changed his mind.

75
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:42,200
He's going to work with Matsumoto now.

76
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,430
I have to stop him.

77
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,330
When did that happen?

78
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,130
Did you offer to go?

79
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,580
Or did my godfather ask you?

80
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:50,870
I offered to go.

81
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:53,290
I'll tell him that I'll accompany you.

82
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,480
It's too dangerous.

83
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:57,070
There must be someone at home.

84
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,659
Just stay at home.

85
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,890
Keep an eye on Glasses.

86
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,870
Don't give him any chance
to redeem himself.

87
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:03,850
I can't let you risk your life.

88
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,390
You know what kind of person he is.

89
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,290
If I go alone, I feel at ease.

90
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,960
I'll do better at my job.

91
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,250
If there's someone following me,

92
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:14,670
I'll get distracted.

93
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:16,120
It's more dangerous.

94
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:21,010
All right.

95
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,240
As you wish.

96
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:24,440

I know you're worried.

Not letting you go to Nation R

108

00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,220
That's all.

175
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:18,190
Bye.

176
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,160
Bye.

177
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,130
[Hey!]

178
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,970
Get the car ready!

179
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,270
Godfather, what's wrong?

180
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,130
Kexin and Mu Qing went to Nation R.

181
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,770
Kexin also went to Nation R.

182
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:35,970
That is Matsumoto's turf.

183
00:08:38,299 --> 00:08:39,350
No.

184
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,500
I'll go to Nation R myself.

185
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,820
I'll bring her back regardless.

186
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,580
Godfather, I can't let that happen.

187
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:45,250
Mu Qing's plan is

188
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,190
before Matsumoto comes into contact
with Spectre,

189
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,680
he wants to cut it off discreetly.

190
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,000
When Matsumoto finds them,

191
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,540
they would've safely evacuated.

192
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,350
But if you go to Nation R,

193
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,800
that's a big hoo-ha.

194
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,830
Don't worry, Godfather.

195
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,160
I'll use all my connections

196
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,830
to locate them in Nation R.

197
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,720
I'll definitely keep her safe.

198
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,260
You should go then.

199
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,230
Remember.

200
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,680
Kexin's safety is our priority.

201
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,740
-Yes.
-Go.

202
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,840
Don't worry, Godfather

203
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,900
I managed to hold him back temporarily.

204
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,310
But with his personality,

205
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,680
they'll come looking for us.

206
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,000
So we don't have much time.

207
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:34,000
Here, take a look.

208
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,950
Rong Yao sent this data to me

209
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,360
before we leave.

210
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,900
Bunichi Matsumoto.

211
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,910
He is 44 years old.

212
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,710
A mix of Chinese and Nation R.

213
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,120
He is the leader

214
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:45,440
of the underworld in Nation R.

215
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,800
On the surface,

216
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,210
he owns Matsumoto Corporation.

217
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,440
Actually,

218
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,030
he is the fourth-gen leader

219
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,700
of Nation R's Tiandao Group.

220
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:55,340
He is a cruel man.

221
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,700
He has a bad temper too.

222
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,770
He is smart, but alert.

223
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,660
Under his leadership,

224
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,470
the group is very united.

225
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,270
This is also why Nation R's police

226
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,850
couldn't do much to them.

227
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,930
This is Li Tianlong.

228
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,070
He is Chinese.

229
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,870
He's Matsumoto's top fighter.

230
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,550
A lot of unspeakable things

231
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,090
were done by him for Matsumoto.

232
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:19,670
In that case,

233
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,250
how can he be free?

234
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,650
That's what's amazing about Matsumoto.

235
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:27,460
Under his command,

236
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,010
Li Tianlong had committed so many crimes.

237
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,370
But the Nation R police

238
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:32,870
have nothing on them.

239
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,470
And Matsumoto has a group

240
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,490
of loyal subordinates.

241
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,430
They can take the fall for him.

242
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,490
In Nation R,

243
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,640
there's a culture.

244
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:44,530
Anyone who takes the fall

245
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,940
will be appreciated.

246
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,260
After they get released,

247
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,620
they'll get promoted.

248
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,290
So it's not easy

249
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:53,330
to catch Matsumoto.

250
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,090
Director Wang just called me.

251
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,660
For the transnational operation
to arrest Spectre,

252
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,640
Nation R police
will cooperate fully with us.

253
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,660
I already asked Zhou Changhao

254
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,890
to inform Spectre

255
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,580
about the arrival
of Group K's reps in Nation R.

256
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,980
Once Spectre gets wind of it,

257
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,120
how would he react?

258
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:17,920
Let's wait and see.

259
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,050
I'm sure Spectre will want to see

260
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,460
Group K and Matsumoto

261
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:24,170
fight for the right

262
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,900
to supply the new drug.

263
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,570
A fight to the death.

264
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,940
Yes.

265
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:32,180
He's trying to take advantage
of the situation.

266
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,400
But now,

267
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,160
Spectre hasn't reached Nation R.

268
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,670
We don't even know
if he'll meet Matsumoto.

269
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:43,710
That's why we can't act now.

270
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,900
You tell them both

271
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,080
to wait for instructions.

272
00:11:46,390 --> 00:11:47,540
After the Nation R police

273
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,810
find out what's going on,

274
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:50,700
then we can plan our next move.

275
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,260
Yes.

276
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,260
Captain Rong.

277
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,270
Captain Rong.

278
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,420
How did it go?

279
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,830
It's too early to tell.

280
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,940
Our spies are waiting in Nation R.

281
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:09,050
For now, we can only do
some cooperative tasks.

282
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,220
Why don't you two go home and rest?

283
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,670
I'm fine, Captain Rong.

284
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,740
Xiaoxiao just had surgery.

285
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:16,970
She needs care.

286
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,470
Keep her company.

287
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:19,740
My family came.

288
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,150
They can take care of Xiaoxiao.

289
00:12:21,410 --> 00:12:23,090
Earlier on, for Xiaoxiao,

290
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,760
it has been hectic for everyone.

291
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:25,900
Especially Yimeng.

292
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,400
She did so much for her.

293
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,540
Thank you, Yimeng.

294
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,080
Don't mention it, Zheng Ke.

295
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,230
At times like this,

296
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,410
you should go back first.

297
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,510
Tell Xiaoxiao.

298
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,100
Once we're all done with work,

299
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,110
we'll visit her.

300
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:37,910
How about this?

301
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,230
After Xiaoxiao gets discharged,

302
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,990
I'll treat everyone to a meal.

303
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,400
Okay.

304
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,500
How about this?

305
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,690
Zhao Ran, Zheng Ke, and I

306
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,830
will keep watch here.

307
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:47,510
We're so close to catching Spectre.

308
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,310
If I go home, I won't feel at ease.

309
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,110
Yimeng.

310
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,390
Go home and rest.

311
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,490
That won't do.

312
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,030
I have to stay with everyone.

313
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,850
Stay and accompany Captain Rong, right?

314
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:03,350
Okay then.

315
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,460
Good work, everyone.

316
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,900
Contact Nation R as soon as possible.

317
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,910
Search for information.

318
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,320
Didn't he just ask us to rest?

319
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,820
Hurry up.

320
00:13:54,430 --> 00:13:55,480
Godfather.

321
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,950
Didn't you quit smoking years ago?

322
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,580
Why did you pick it up again?

323
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,910
How is it in Nation R?

324
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,680
I just talked to Mu Qing on the phone.

325
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,310
So far, so good.

326
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,810
[Mr. Li.]

327
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:17,920
[The raw materials transporter
just now said]

328
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,290
[they'll stop supplying us.]

329
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,870
Why?

330
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,850
[He didn't explain.]

331
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:24,870
Okay.

332
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:28,530
What's wrong?

333
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,270
Feng.

334
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,810
Thank you for coming all the way.

335
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:34,860
Thank you so much.

336
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,140
-It's nothing.
-Please sit.

337
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,190
Have a seat.

338
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:40,190
Here's to you.

339
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,150
Okay.

340
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,000
Here.

341
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,810
I was so scared today.

342
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:54,880
I was driving a truck today.

343
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,040
I drove here from the outskirts.

344
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,370
Halfway there,

345
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:02,190
I bumped into a police inspection.

346
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,870
If I hadn't turned the car around,

347
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,860
you won't see me today.

348
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:09,660
Feng.

349
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,120
Don't say things like that.

350
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:12,700
Aren't we eating and drinking

351
00:15:12,790 --> 00:15:14,020
together now?

352
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:17,580
How are the goods? It's not seized?

353
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,950
No.

354
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,150
Ruosheng.

355
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,040
From now on,

356
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,840
the raw materials I have,

357
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,740
I might not be able

358
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,940
to provide the supplies on time.

359
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,370
Please forgive me.

360
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,690
Feng.

361
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,890
You're putting me in a tight spot.

362
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:42,750
It's a big workshop.

363
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,130
My brothers are waiting for me
to support them.

364
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,770
You said you're stopping the supply.

365
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,660
Production will also stop.

366
00:15:50,670 --> 00:15:52,700
Wouldn't my godfather get even with me?

367
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,710
You have a whole family to support.

368
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,090
Me too.

369
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,020
The raw material business

370
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,830
is making too little profit.

371
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,890
The police are watching us closely.

372
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:07,650
The money isn't enough.

373
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:10,340
Who would work for me?

374
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,730
Do you agree with what I've said?

375
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,280
Feng, you're right.

376
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,140
Feng.

377
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,030
Here is 200,000 yuan.

378
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:26,400
Can you distribute it

379
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,810
to the delivery guys today?

380
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,140
Let's close the deal first.

381
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,850
After that, we can discuss.

382
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,820
Is that okay?

383
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,760
Are you looking down on me?

384
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:36,650
My brothers,

385
00:16:37,310 --> 00:16:38,540
I'll take care of them.

386
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,740
This 200,000 yuan makes no difference.

387
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,970
It looks like

388
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,420
you want a bigger difference.

389
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,290
Since money can solve the problem,

390
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,480
it's not a problem.

391
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:52,800
This 200,000 yuan.

392
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,120
Please hold onto it.

393
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,320
From now on,

394
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:58,250
I'll give you an extra 4%.

395
00:16:58,690 --> 00:16:59,710
An extra 4%?

396
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,430
Ruosheng.

397
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,369
You're still young.

398
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,010
In this line of business,

399
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:10,000
who isn't risking their lives every day

400
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:11,630
to earn money?

401
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:14,800
In your eyes,

402
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:16,950
my brothers' lives

403
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,240
are only worth 4%.

404
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,589
Feng, name your price.

405
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,540
Extra 20%.

406
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,430
If you're willing,

407
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,670
I'll ask my men to take the risk.

408
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,080
If you're unwilling,

409
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,020
find another supplier.

410
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,530
Feng.

411
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,730
Based on our age difference,

412
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,250
I should actually call you Mr. Feng.

413
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,070
But Feng's reputation is spotless

414
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,000
in this industry.

415
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:00,340
You're capable and loyal.

416
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,540
That's why I respect you in my heart.

417
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,350
But you request something like that

418
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,580
from a junior.

419
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,530
It's a little embarrassing for me.

420
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,820
It's 7%.

421
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,120
That's my bottom line.

422
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,490
Then there's nothing to talk about.

423
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,130
Then we won't talk.

424
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:21,500
I'm off.

425
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,510
What's wrong?

426
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,660
Are you going to fight?

427
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,770
Feng.

428
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,290
Who would fight in this day and age?

429
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,790
All right.

430
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,380
Let's not talk about business.

431
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:46,890
Let's sit and talk, okay?

432
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:52,170
Okay.

433
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,310
My godfather always says this to me.

434
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,650
He said a person can have nothing.

435
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,340
But he can't be ungrateful.

436
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,380
Five years ago,
if my godfather hadn't saved your life,

437
00:19:15,130 --> 00:19:17,330
you were long dead in the Golden Triangle.

438
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,310
Is this how you repay him?

439
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,640
Who do you think you are?

440
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,570
How dare you lecture me?

441
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,420
I'm nobody.

442
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,750
I'm in no position to lecture you.

443
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,740
The group isn't mine.

444
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:34,710
It's my godfather's.

445
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,820
I'm just an errand boy.

446
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:38,580
I have no reason to offend you.

447
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,530
Today, you asked for a huge favor.

448
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,730
If my godfather knows about this,

449
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,640
I have no idea what he'll do.

450
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,230
You're using Mr. Ou to threaten me.

451
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,370
Do you think I'm scared?

452
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,720
If my godfather doesn't scare you,

453
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,240
let's talk about things
that will freak you out.

454
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:08,060
Your son is in Macau.

455
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:10,040
He lost hundreds of thousands.

456
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,210
He's finishing all the money you earned.

457
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,450
You're getting rich alone.

458
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,450
You say you're poor
in front of your brothers.

459
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,830
If your brothers find out,

460
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,990
what will they think?

461
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,170
Are you threatening me?

462
00:20:43,970 --> 00:20:46,120
What a horrible thing to say.

463
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,250
Feng, I'm not threatening you.

464
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:52,020
I want a win-win situation.

465
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:54,350
Let's make money together.

466
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,770
Besides, if anything happens

467
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,960
to your son in Macau,

468
00:20:58,710 --> 00:21:00,290
I can take care of him.

469
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,970
If you don't appreciate the gesture,

470
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,570
I won't go easy on you.

471
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,040
Think about it.

472
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,440
Look at me.

473
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,840
I'm getting confused as I get older.

474
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,930
Why am I competing with my own family?

475
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,180
Ruosheng.

476
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,160
I'll drink as punishment.

477
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:32,580
In the future,

478
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,860
your goods,

479
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,940
I'll do my best to supply them.

480
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,440
Thank you, Feng.

481
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,490
Okay?

482
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,260
Feng.

483
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,410
You shouldn't drink on an empty stomach.

484
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,640
Have some food.

485
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:50,010
I have to be sincere.

486
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:57,880
Here.

487
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,160
Thank you.

488
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,790
Godfather.

489
00:22:04,970 --> 00:22:06,110
What brings you here?

490
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:08,930
Bravo.

491
00:22:09,410 --> 00:22:10,640
It was brilliant.

492
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,150
I didn't expect

493
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,890
the impulsive and mindless
Li Ruosheng back then

494
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,910
can use his brain now.

495
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,770
He also resembles a great leader now.

496
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,670
Thank you for your compliment.

497
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,690
Mostly,

498
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,320
against people like them,

499
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,770
you must have some dirt on them.

500
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,180
"Know thy self, know thy enemy."

501
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,470
Did Mu Qing teach you that?

502
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:37,170
Indeed, Mu Qing has helped me a lot.

503
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,420
You accepted me as your godson.

504
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:40,830
I can't embarrass you.

505
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,160
I have a lot of guts,

506
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:45,050
but my brain is still

507
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:47,600
a bit too simple.

508
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,270
So I followed Mu Qing

509
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,590
and learned a lot discreetly.

510
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,400
Without him, I wouldn't be here today.

511
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:55,830
A student learns from a master.

512
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,290
When do you think

513
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,760
the student can surpass the master?

514
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,300
Surpass?

515
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,890

Kexin is a girl.

00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:20,890
He still won't let me run his business.

687
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,740
He would rather trust an outsider.

688
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:24,630
He trusts Glasses.

689
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,140
Recently,

690
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,460
especially these past few days,

691
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:29,780
he wants to send me abroad.

692
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:32,810
I'm sure you've heard the rumor.

693
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:35,760
Yes.

694
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,400
What does that have to do with me?

695
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:40,250
I originally thought,

696
00:31:40,510 --> 00:31:42,100
by getting Ecstasy Dream,

697
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,900
I can take over Group K.

698
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:45,620
Who knows?

699
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,640
Here comes your Tiandao Group.

700
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,900
Of course, I understand.

701
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,520
To Spectre,

702
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,330
it's better to watch us

703
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,780
compete for it in a bloody war.

704
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,630
He is waiting to take advantage.

705
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:01,760
But it's not worth it to me.

706
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,100
So I thought about it.

707
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,300
Rather than getting surrounded by enemies,

708
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,500
I'd rather

709
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,080
set up my own business

710
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,490
and be your working partner.

711
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:31,730
These are all Mu Qing's dark web systems.

712
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,440
After I get Ecstasy Dream,

713
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,460
with Mu Qing's dark web systems,

714
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,500
I believe it won't take long

715
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:46,990
to escape Group K's control.

716
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,290
It's only a matter of time
before I take over Group K.

717
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,880
Also, you'll get more

718
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,030
than half of the profits in China.

719
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,890
To you and me,

720
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,520
isn't it a win-win situation?

721
00:33:01,510 --> 00:33:02,480
Of course.

722
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:04,150
You can catch us right now.

723
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,250
Even kill us both.

724
00:33:05,910 --> 00:33:07,450
But you know my dad.

725
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,960
He won't let it slide.

726
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,080
I don't think that's what you want, right?

727
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,600
So I think

728
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,720
you should really think about

729
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,060
what I suggested earlier.

730
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,460
Let's talk

731
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:46,170
after my discussion with Spectre.

732

733

See them out.

735
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,670
Captain Rong, look.

736
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:06,900
They sent out a confirmation signal.

737
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,000
Spectre is there.

738
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:10,190
Yimeng, contact the Nation R police.

739
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,909
Check if they received the exact location.

740
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,010
Yes.

741
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,199
Mr. Spectre.

742
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,909
We finally meet.

743

744
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,090
There is news from the Nation R police.

745
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,429
They are rushing over
to Matsumoto Corporation.

746
00:34:45,699 --> 00:34:46,850
I got it.

747
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:03,870
Mr. Spectre.

748
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:05,550
The conditions you asked for

749
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:06,730
will be fulfilled.

750
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:13,640

751
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,800
Take them away.

752
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,740
Come on.

00:36:03,490 --> 00:36:04,550

757
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:01,000
We lost the signal.

What happened?

759
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,770
I'm not sure.

760
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,760
Captain Rong, I received confirmation.

761
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,260
Spectre and Matsumoto were arrested.

762
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,970
But they didn't find our undercover agents

856
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:20,660
♫ Waiting for you to kiss my forehead ♫

857
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,120
♫ It seems you're in front of me ♫

858
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:25,760
♫ Like the four seasons in my heart ♫

859
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:29,060
♫ Gentle and heart-wrenching ♫

860
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:32,360
♫ What can I say? ♫

861
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:35,180
♫ At the place farthest away ♫

862
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:38,300
♫ Only then will the kites roam freely ♫

863
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:41,080
♫ If I gaze relentlessly ♫

864
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,200
♫ I wonder if there will be starlight ♫

865
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:47,150
♫ Standing on your spot ♫

866
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,580
♫ Only then will I forget
the faraway place ♫

867
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:52,080
♫ Only your gaze ♫

868
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,380
♫ Can give me acknowledgment ♫

869
00:43:55,510 --> 00:44:01,540
♫ Can give me an answer ♫
