334
00:17:19,819 --> 00:17:21,050
That way, they won't dare to hurt you.

335
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,060
It's for your own good.

336
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,079
You're back.

337
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,579
♫ The wind blows past me as I zone out ♫

338
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:29,370
♫ When I turn around,
I lose you in the midst of a crowd ♫

339
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:30,030
That's enough. No one is here.

340
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,800
♫ You are a teardrop away ♫

341
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,960
Drop the act. You can let me go now.

342
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,360
♫ And I shall quietly wait ♫

343
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:39,750
♫ If love never leaves us ♫

344
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,480
I know everything now.

345
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,540
♫ This beautiful encounter ♫

346
00:17:42,570 --> 00:17:43,670
What do you know?

347
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,530
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

348
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,930
♫ Say goodbye ♫

349
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,440
♫ The wind blows past you
as you zone out ♫

350
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,940
Someone is coming.

351
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,490
Hands up!

352
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,130
♫ Suddenly, I realized ♫

353
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,560
Come out!

354
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:11,390
♫ What we experience is love ♫

355
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,750
Did you see anyone suspicious?

356
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,300
♫ And time is my love confession ♫

357
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,720
No.

358
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,650
♫ If love ever comes ♫

359
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:22,030
♫ It's the sweetest thing
I look forward to ♫

360
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,680
Rong Yu.

361
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:25,330
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

362
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:25,690
Rong Yu.

363
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:28,240
♫ Say goodbye ♫

364
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:34,180
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

365
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,700
Rong Yu!

366
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,220
Rong Yu!

367
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:38,360
♫ Say goodbye ♫

368
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:36,330
Rong Yu.

369
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:01,370
They were locked up
in an abandoned wine cellar.

370
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,820
How are they now?

371
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,230
They're at the hospital.

372
00:19:04,670 --> 00:19:05,590
Rong Yu is hurt.

373
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,400
But she's not
in critical condition anymore.

374
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,850
But the one who injured them

375
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,520
was Matsumoto's subordinate, Li Tianlong.

376
00:19:10,610 --> 00:19:11,620
He fled.

377
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,470
What about Ou Zhenhai?

378
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,110
They don't know anything yet.

379
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,400
Because the bodyguards
he sent to protect them

380
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,980
are still searching for them.

381
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,630
There's no time to lose.

382
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,390
Coordinate with Country R police
right away.

383
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,890
Find a way to let Group K know

384
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,830
that they are admitted to the hospital.

385
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:30,540
Got it.

386
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,050
What?

387
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,160
Kexin is hurt?

388
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,190
Where are they now?

389
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,190
What do you mean
her life is not in danger?

390
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:47,480
Find a way to bring them back.

391
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:49,110
Right now!

392
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,640
You're awake.

393
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,920
How do you feel?

394
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,240
Where am I?

395
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,760
How did we get out?

396
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,060
Wait, don't move.

397
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:38,960
Although you didn't injure any bones,

398
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,290
it will take time to recover.

399
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,960
The police saved us.

400
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,140
The police?

401
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:55,280
What about Spectre?

402
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,580
Matsumoto and Spectre have been captured.

403
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,440
But that Spectre was a fake.

404
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,430
He was a fake?

405
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,930
How can it be?

406
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:17,990
Why are you crying?

407
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,370
And you said you didn't like me.

408
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,140
Don't you have anything to say to me?

409
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,860
How long are you going to hide it from me?

410
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:42,050
From the day of your accident until now,

411
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:45,220
I haven't been able to forgive myself.

412
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:48,610
There were many so moments

413
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,650
when Ou Kexin reminded me of you.

414
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,090
The more I spent time with Ou Kexin,

415
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,380
the more she reminded me of you.

416
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,470
The more that happened,

417
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,370
the more I missed you.

418
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,310
Sometimes, I tried to use this way

419
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,410
to numb my feelings.

420
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,640
But I knew one thing.

421
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,430
It was impossible for you to come back.

422
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,300
But until just now,

423
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,500
when you recited the poem

424
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,820
that only the two of us know

425
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:25,920
in the wine cellar,

426
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,140
I was certain of it.

427
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,440
The woman before me

428
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,000
is Rong Yu who's always in my heart.

429
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,600
I know I'm going against the rules.

430
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,530
But I don't care if you admit it or not.

431
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,680
I just know.

432
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,300
You must be Rong Yu.

433
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,550
I missed you.

434
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,340
I missed you so much.

435
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,400
I've imagined reuniting with you

436
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,820
countless times.

437
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,510
But I didn't think
this is how it would be.

438
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,020
I'm sorry.

439
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:36,140
I'm sorry.

440
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,200
Yuanwen, I'm sorry.

441
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,550
I'm sorry.

442
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:02,940
Mr. Glasses.

443
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,130
We found Madam Bao.

444
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:08,220
Good job.

445
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:12,220
Send men to keep a close eye on her.

446
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,030
When those two come back,

447
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:17,020
bring Madam Bao to meet Ou Kexin.

448
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,120
Yes.

449
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,860
Sir.

450
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,370
I brought you

451
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,300
some cured meat from my hometown.

452
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,070
Have a seat.

453
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,390
Thank you, sir.

454
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,110
What's wrong?

455
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,740
Have you gotten sick

456
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,500
of living leisure and carefree life?

457
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,300
Not yet.

458
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,370
I actually think my retirement life

459
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,600
is quite good.

460
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,380
I've thought it through.

461
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,140
I'm not young anymore.

462
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,780
There's no need to fight
with young people.

463
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,360
I should let them take over.

464
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,040
So what's up with you today?

465
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,850
You came to see me because you miss me?

466
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,210
I really missed you.

467
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,060
I heard that Kexin got hurt overseas.

468
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,450
Aren't you retired?

469
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:21,300
How are you still so well-informed?

470
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,420
It's a big deal that Kexin was hurt.

471
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,180
Of course I care.

472
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,290
You can't keep a grown woman.

473
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,160
She's so obsessed with Mu Qing.

474
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,700
She even risked her life for him.

475
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:41,580
Sir.

476
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:44,400
Guess who called me yesterday.

477
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,300
Who was it?

478
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,670
Madam Bao.

479
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:52,010
Madam Bao?

480
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,290
I haven't heard from her in a while.

481
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,480
How is she?

482
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,580
She's doing great.

483
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,810
She's a grandma now.

484
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,440
She has a grandson.

485
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,450
She was afraid to call you,

486
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,260
so she contacted me yesterday.

487
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,870
She has always missed Kexin.

488
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,070
Because of what happened to Kexin

489
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,030
three years ago,

490
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,320
she has always blamed herself for it.

491
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,450
After talking to her on the phone,

492
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,250
this is what I thought.

493
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,490
Kexin is hurt.

494
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:27,960
And Madam Bao misses her.

495
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,040
Maybe you can let Madam Bao come over

496
00:26:31,130 --> 00:26:32,620
and take care of Kexin for a few days.

497
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:35,350
Madam Bao has been taking care
of Kexin previously.

498
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,860
She knows exactly what Kexin likes.

499
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:41,690
I think it can help Kexin

500
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:42,920
to recover faster.

501
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,450
It sounds good.

502
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,520
Bring her over then.

503
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,150
Sure.

504
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,270
Let's give Kexin a little surprise.

505
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:57,040
I'm sure Kexin will be thrilled

506
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,360
to see Madam Bao.

507
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,370
How are you feeling?

508
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,220
Are you tired?

509
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,080
Yes.

510
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,540
Stop moving.

511
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,120
I won't be tired if I lean on you.

512
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,460
Let me warn you two.

513
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:45,040
Godfather is furious

514
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,360
about what happened this time.

515
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,080
Be careful when we get back.

516
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,970
Look who's talking.

517
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,730
It was because you couldn't do your job.

518
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,800
If you had found
some smart guys to save us,

519
00:27:53,890 --> 00:27:55,430
things wouldn't have ended up like this.

520
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,630
It was out of my reach.

521
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,390
You guys were abroad.

522
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,630
You should take the blame too, Mu Qing.

523
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,830
You said it would be more dangerous

524
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,060
if many people were involved.

525
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,040
Why did you take Kexin along then?

526
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,500
That's enough.

527
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,900
I'm all right.

528
00:28:09,990 --> 00:28:10,870
Stop nagging him.

529
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,760
It will be too late
if anything happens to you.

530
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,260
When you guys get back,

531
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:15,930
Godfather won't spare either of you.

532
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:18,530
Just focus on driving.

533
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,760
Don't be a busybody.

534
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,440
Does it hurt?

535
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,370
[Is it here?]

536
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,640
Don't touch it.

537
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,360
Does it hurt?

538
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,370
It hurts.

539
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,180
But I'm better now.

540
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,830
Is this how you protect my daughter?

541
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:46,200
I'm sorry, sir.

542
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,740
You're sorry?

543
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,290
I'm telling you,
if anything happens to Kexin,

544
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,360
you'll have to pay for it
with more than your life.

545
00:28:52,450 --> 00:28:53,330
Dad.

546
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,830
That's enough.

547
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:56,370
Look, I'm all right.

548
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,860
Don't take his side.

549
00:28:57,950 --> 00:28:59,230
Do you want to die?

550
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,050
The doctor said I couldn't be agitated.

551
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:07,500
You're the one who agitates me.

552
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,210
All right.

553
00:29:18,410 --> 00:29:19,290
All right.

554
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,570
Let's talk over dinner.

555
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,290
I've prepared all your favorite dishes.

556
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,250
Are you okay?

557
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,020
Slowly.

558
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,510
You cooked a lot of food again.

559
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,700
-I'm fine.
-Godfather.

560
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:47,890
Can we eat now?

561
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,910
-Of course.
-Thank you, Godfather

562
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:52,330
Kexin, eat up. It's good for your health.

563
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,430
What's wrong?

564
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,920
This is peanut milk.

565
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,680
Dad.

566
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:08,480
There's peanut milk.

567
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,990
And there's peanut in every dish.

568
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,970
I'm allergic to peanuts. Did you forget?

569
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,330
You're right.

570
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,920
Why are there peanuts?

571
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,240
Madam Bao.

572
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,560
Madam Bao?

573
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:29,070
Madam Bao, it's really you.

574
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:30,920
Surprise!

575
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:33,650
It has been a while.

576
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:34,840
I've missed you.

577
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,600
I had always wanted to visit you.

578
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,530
I just couldn't find the opportunity.

579
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,510
Look, I made carp with bean paste today.

580
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,110
It's your favorite. Come and eat.

581
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,300
Madam Bao.

582
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:49,750
I don't eat fish.

583
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,200
I'm allergic to fish.

584
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,050
That's right.

585
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,780
Kexin doesn't eat fish or peanuts.

586
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:56,920
Don't you remember?

587
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,920
I'm so forgetful.

588
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,540
There are some other dishes.

589
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,690
I'll go get them.

590
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,760
Madam Bao, please have a seat.

591
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,940
You and Kexin haven't met in a while.

592
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,570
You guys should catch up. I'll get them.

593
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:09,420
-Have a seat and eat with us.
-Kexin, come.

594
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,870
Come and eat.

595
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,980
-Slowly.
-What's wrong?

596
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,260
I hurt my shoulder.

597
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,150
Why were you so careless?

598
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:21,430
Dad, what a surprise.

599
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,540
When did you find Madam Bao?

600
00:31:23,630 --> 00:31:24,950
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

601
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,110
Mr. Glasses cares about you.

602
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,340
He found out you got hurt.

603
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,750
So he brought Madam Bao here

604
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,020
to take care of you.

605
00:31:35,510 --> 00:31:36,700
Mr. Glasses?

606
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,370
He's back?

607
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:40,790
Why didn't he join us?

608
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,370
Then I can thank him in person.

609
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,740
Come on, Kexin.

610
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,370
Have some soup.

611
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:46,820
Thank you.

612
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,990
Are you all right? I'm sorry.

613
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,260
-What's wrong?
-I'm sorry.

614
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,950
-Why did you spill the soup on her?
-It's okay.

615
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:54,960
I'll do it.

616
00:31:55,970 --> 00:31:57,070
I'll do it.

617
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,480
-Come on.
-Be careful, Madam Bao.

618
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:00,590
-I'm fine.
-Did you get scalded, Kexin?

619
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:04,810
Sir.

620
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,750
-Are you okay?
-I'm getting old.

621
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,290
I became clumsy too.

622
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,790
I'll clean this up.

623
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:12,070
It's okay as long as Kexin is fine.
Go clean it up.

624
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,770
Don't cut yourself.

625
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,740
Okay.

626
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,080
Are you okay?

627
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,940
If you're fine, then sit down and eat.

628
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,530
There are other dishes to eat.

629
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:39,480
Madam Bao.

630
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:42,120
Your eldest granddaughter

631
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,460
is turning five soon, right?

632
00:32:44,810 --> 00:32:45,910
Yes.

633
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,210
How did you find me?

634
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:56,470
Finding you was a piece of cake.

635
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,980
What do you want?

636
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,070
Don't panic.

637
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:06,060
It has been a while since we met,
my old friend.

638
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:08,080
So I thought I'd drop by
and catch up with you.

639
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,590
I didn't say a word

640
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,500
about what you guys have done
to anyone else.

641
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,320
Of course you didn't.

642
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:19,520
Otherwise,

643
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,770
your family wouldn't have
stayed alive today.

644
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,480
You...

645
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,550
What exactly do you want?

646
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,590
Madam Bao.

647
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:30,880
Back then,

648
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,120
the Ou family sent you abroad

649
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,350
to look after Ms. Ou.

650
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,950
You've seen the world.

651
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,660
You've eaten and drank overseas.

652
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,030
And you've made a good buck.

653
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:45,920
You should know

654
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,080
that the Ou family gave you

655
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:49,310
everything you have now.

656
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,920
But...

657
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,160
To be precise,

658
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,320
I was the one who gave you
what you have now.

659
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,740
After all,

660
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:01,320
I was the one who hired you back then

661
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:03,700
and sent you abroad, right?

662
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,000
Yes.

663
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,080
It's good that you know.

664
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:13,159
I came to see you today

665
00:34:13,770 --> 00:34:15,580
to ask you a small favor.

666
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:17,429
If you promise me,

667
00:34:17,510 --> 00:34:19,190
I'll give you a lot of money.

668
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,830
It will be double the price

669
00:34:21,909 --> 00:34:23,409
of what you earned overseas.

670
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:29,000
I won't do anything illegal or unethical.

671
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,230
I would never ask you

672
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:31,810
to do anything like that.

673
00:34:33,219 --> 00:34:35,250
It's something that you can do

674
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,969
to repay Mr. Ou's and my kindness.

675
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,880
While you're away from your grandchild,

676
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:46,989
I'll have someone

677
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,270
to take good care of her

678
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,429
and keep her safe.

679
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,489
I beg you.

680
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,900
Please.

681
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,010
Please don't hurt my grandchild.

682
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,880
I've handed over

683
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,520
the group's business to Ruosheng.

684
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,070
Don't get yourself involved anymore.

685
00:35:13,830 --> 00:35:16,030
-Mr. Ou, I...
-Stop it.

686
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,700
I've made up my mind.

687
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:23,380
The one who got caught

688
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,980
wasn't the real Spectre.

689
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,360
I spoke to the real Spectre

690
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,600
over the phone this morning.

691
00:35:32,050 --> 00:35:33,590
Now that Matsumoto is in custody,

692
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,660
our group is the only one left

693
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,240
that he can work with

694
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,310
in Southeast Asia.

695
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,660
Sir, what do you mean?

696
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:45,600
Ruosheng will take care
of the group's business.

697
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,110
As for you,

698
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,700
get ready to welcome Spectre.

699
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,420
Sure, I'll arrange it right away.

700
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,230
There's no need to rush.

701
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,750
We have the upper hand right now.

702
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:03,990
Let's play hard to get.

703
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,120
I want to teach him a lesson.

704
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,420
Yes.

705
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,100
I'll let what happened to Kexin slide.

706
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,440
This is your last chance.

707
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:19,260
Yes, sir.

708
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,380
Get to work.

709
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,870
Godfather asked to see you alone.

710
00:36:44,950 --> 00:36:46,190
Did he give you a hard time?

711
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,970
Yes, it was the hardest time in my life.

712
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,130
If I answer that way,

713
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:53,970
do I satisfy your curiosity?

714
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,100
What do you mean?

715
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,050
I'm just concerned about you.

716
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,750
You're really something.

717
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,290
You're so lucky

718
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,360
to have Kexin as your lucky charm.

719
00:37:10,170 --> 00:37:11,750
I'm different.

720
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,420
The burden on my shoulders

721
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,870
will only get heavier from now on.

722
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:18,390
What do you mean?

723
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,990
Godfather promoted me.

724
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,160
How?

725
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,450
How else?

726
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:28,650
Godfather said he's leaving me

727
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:29,700
in charge of the group.

728
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,370
Weren't you away for a while?

729
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,000
A lot of things happened to the group.

730
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,850
Godfather can only let me handle it.

731
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:37,450
That was probably how he figured out

732
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,560
that I'm capable of getting things done.

733
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:41,270
But that's not the point.

734
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,840
Maybe he thinks he's getting old,

735
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:46,820
so he wants a stable life.

736
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,490
He told me

737
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,690
that if the business deal with Spectre

738
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,740
works out,

739
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:53,460
he'll take you and Kexin

740
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,040
to start a new life somewhere peaceful

741
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,190
until the end of his life.

742
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,520
Tell me.

743
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,160
In the past, we desperately wanted

744
00:38:05,250 --> 00:38:06,480
to prove ourselves.

745
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:10,530
We wanted to work hard to show our value.

746
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,480
We longed for this day to come.

747
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,030
But now that the day has come,

748
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,060
it turns out to be

749
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,550
the countdown of our separation.

750
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,900
Is this how life is?

751
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,210
Ruosheng.

752
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,630
I think you've changed.

753
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:31,170
How have I changed?

754
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,380
You're becoming more and more realistic.

755
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,780
Mu Qing, I would accept it

756
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,100
if someone else told me that.

757
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,950
But how could you say that?

758
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:43,930
Godfather said

759
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,340
he would entrust the group to me.

760
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,540
I had no choice but to accept it.

761
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,720
I couldn't refuse, could I?

762
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,880
But on the other hand,

763
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,860
you're Godfather's future son-in-law.

764
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:53,830
In the end,

765
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,540
the group still belongs to you and Kexin.

766
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,300
I'm just managing it for you temporarily.

767
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,980
I'm working for you.

768
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,530
How could you call me realistic?

769
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:02,980
I don't know what else to say.

770
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,940
Were you fooling me?

771
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,660
Were you trying to tease me?

772
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,860
You're crazy.

773
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,000
Was that fun?

774
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:17,370
That was fun.

775
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,640
You're a weirdo.

776
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:11,840
Madam Bao.

777
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:13,910
Kexin.

778
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,060
Here. Madam Bao, have a seat.

779
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,430
Madam Bao.

780
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,150
You don't look well.

781
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,380
You need to rest.

782
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:27,320
It's nothing. I'm fine.

783
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:29,790
Kexin.

784
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:31,770
You've been through a lot.

785
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,730
But seeing that you're healthy and happy,

786
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,660
I'm very happy for you.

787
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,440
Madam Bao.

788
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:51,260
You have to take care of yourself too.

789
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:53,150
Don't make me worry.

790
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:55,660
Don't worry.

791
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,730
I'll get going then.

792
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,610
We've already found out

793
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,840
that Spectre was a fake.

794
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,440
It's not surprising for him to do that.

795
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,850
It's his usual trick.

796
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:33,500
Now that Matsumoto got caught,

797
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,140
Group K is Spectre's only choice.

798
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:38,780
He'll definitely contact Mr. Ou soon.

799
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:41,110
But...

800
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:44,320
Mr. Ou still doesn't trust me completely.

801
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,010
While I was away,

802
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:50,040
he has secretly handed over

803
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:52,860
all the group's business to Li Ruosheng.

804
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,710
He's planning to leave Yungang

805
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,720
with Skylark

806
00:41:56,470 --> 00:41:58,620
after closing the deal with Spectre.

807
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,290
So we'll have to be more careful

808
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,350
with every step we take next.

809
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,200
Yes.

810
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:10,020
How is...

811
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,130
Skylark's recovery?

812
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,670
It's all good.

813
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:16,310
If the men who saved us
had been a minute late,

814
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,950
it would've been catastrophic.

815
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,070
Thank you for your hard work.

816
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:26,470
We have an emergency now.

00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:55,620
♫ I really hope you can understand ♫

840
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,040
♫ So I remain extremely quiet and gentle ♫

841
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:08,380
♫ Waiting for you to kiss my forehead ♫

842
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:10,750
♫ It seems you're in front of me ♫

843
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,660
♫ Like the four seasons in my heart ♫

844
00:44:15,330 --> 00:44:16,690
♫ Gentle and heart-wrenching ♫

845
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,600
♫ What can I say? ♫

846
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:22,850
♫ At the place farthest away ♫

847
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:26,020
♫ Only then will the kites roam freely ♫

848
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,700
♫ If I gaze relentlessly ♫

849
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:31,960
♫ I wonder if there will be starlight ♫

850
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,820
♫ Standing on your spot ♫

851
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,340
♫ Only then will I forget
the faraway place ♫

852
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,570
♫ Only your gaze ♫

853
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:42,870
♫ Can give me acknowledgment ♫

854
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:49,160
♫ Can give me an answer ♫
