1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,880
[Episode 13]

3
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:37,190
We can reestablish

4
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,820
Dakun's sales network.

5
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,440
And we will weave this net

6
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,820
deeper and denser than before.

7
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,680
Words alone are no proof.

8
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,820
Godfather.

9
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,940
Just give us three months.

10
00:01:49,289 --> 00:01:50,170
There's no need.

11
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,620
Sir.

12
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:54,039
All we need is a month.

13
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,620
Good.

14
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,600
I can wait for a month.

15
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,590
You have one month's time.

16
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,180
If you can deliver what you promised,

17
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,640
I'll be confident in handing over

18
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,259
the business to both of you.

19
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,000
Thank you, Mr. Ou.

20
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,100
Thank you, Godfather.

21
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,540
Sir, we'll leave now.

22
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,680
Okay.

23
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,720
One month?

24
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,329
One month.

25
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,530
One month? Are you out of your mind?

26
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,390
I wasn't even confident
when I asked for three months.

27
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:46,750
It won't work even in a year.

28
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,740
If I dare say so,

29
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:50,930
then I can definitely do it.

30
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,390
It's okay even if we can't do it.

31
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,490
How can it be okay?

32
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,380
Here, take a look.

33
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:09,590
What do these mean?

34
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:11,650
Mr. Ou wanted to divide these turfs evenly

35
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,930
for every one of us.

36
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,100
He wants to use these territories
to balance out our power.

37
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:18,520
But those guys didn't say anything.

38
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:20,450
Mr. Ou didn't want to offend anyone.

39
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,579
So he chose us to take responsibility.

40
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,920
Do you think we can count this

41
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,150
as a favor he owes us?

42
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,810
In other words,

43
00:03:32,329 --> 00:03:33,520
even if we can't do it,

44
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,150
so what?

45
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,730
Am I right?

46
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,150
No wonder you can talk big.

47
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,280
The adult world is so complicated.

48
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,220
Forget it. Let's take care of this first.

49
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,540
We only have one month.

50
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,640
How can we pull it off?

51
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,150
Let's not think about that yet.

52
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,860
I want to show you something.

53
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,060
The world of adults.

54
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,580
Where are we going?

55
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,340
Why are you being so secretive?

56
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,300
Open the door.

57
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,660
Where is this?

58
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,100
Mr. Mu.

59
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,550
Mr. Li.

60
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,560
Why does this place

61
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,340
feel a little spooky?

62
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,850
Is this a Republic of China vintage theme?

63
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,320
We should each wear three-piece outfits

64
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,720
and a bowler hat.

65
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:03,460
Here.

66
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:04,640
Take a look.

67
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,200
This is your new friend.

68
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:08,690
It's called the dark web.

69
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,770
It's an encrypted online trading platform.

70
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,630
Even if the police find out
about this place,

71
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,390
they won't be able to crack the password.

72
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,120
It's well-concealed and secure.

73
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,570
Think about it.

74
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,600
If we have more clients

75
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,580
making deals through the dark web,

76
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,290
then the transactions

77
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,930
will definitely be unimaginable.

78
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,000
Is today my birthday?

79
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,640
Why did you prepare

80
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,000
such a big surprise for me?

81
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,830
How long have you been
hiding this from me?

82
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,900
You're only telling me about it today.

83
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:43,010
How long have you been preparing?

84
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,840
So do you like it?

85
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,510
Give me a hug.

86
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,620
Bring it in.

87
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,540
Give me a hug.

88
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,659
This is unnecessary.

89
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:12,840
What kind of situation is this?

90
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,310
All of us have been fooled

91
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:17,110
by those two brats all of a sudden.

92
00:06:18,690 --> 00:06:19,790
Why are you laughing?

93
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,350
The three of us.

94
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,280
We're not young anymore.

95
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,790
But we were all fooled like children.

96
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,860
I have quite high expectations
for them both.

97
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,500
They're young and talented.

98
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:37,480
As compared to Dakun,

99
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,330
their means are way better.

100
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:40,690
What do you mean?

101
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,930
I don't mean anything.

102
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,080
Rather than making them our enemies,

103
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,500
why don't we turn them into our allies?

104
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,740
It's business after all.

105
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,600
Who would have a problem with money?

106
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,290
Don't you agree?

107
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,380
[For justice]

108
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,900
[Justice will always prevail.]

109
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:33,490
[People in this industry
will eventually need to pay the price.]

110
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,250
[When disaster strikes, run separately.]

111
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,659
[Isn't that our rule?]

112
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,220
[Mr. Dakun.]

113
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,380
[Confess for leniency]

114
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:43,960
[or you'll be punished severely.]

115
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,420
[Forget about those]

116
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,909
[whom you call friends or brothers.]

117
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,280
[In the end,]

118
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,990
[you're the one who bears the punishment.]

119
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,220
Dad.

120
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,990
You're here too, Mr. Glasses.

121
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,310
Dad.

122
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,680
Have you seen Mr. Dakun?

123
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:06,180
Kexin.

124
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,870
Why do you want to see Mr. Dakun?

125
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,540
I have something to ask him.

126
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,780
I have tailored some clothes
for him and his men.

127
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,790
They made a lot.

128
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,910
I called him when I finished,

129
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:17,140
but he didn't pick up.

130
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,780
He still owes me a 30% balance.

131
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,970
Dad.

132
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,080
Do you think Mr. Dakun
will repudiate the debt?

133
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,930
How about this?

134
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:27,740
I'll pay the money that he owes you.

135
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,850
That's not right.

136
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,040
You don't owe me the money.

137
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,100
It's okay.

138
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,570
Did something happen

139
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,909
to Mr. Dakun?

140
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,140
Glasses.

141
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:44,550
Step outside for a while.

142
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,090
I'd like to talk to Kexin in private.

143
00:08:58,190 --> 00:08:59,070
Dad.

144
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,450
Tell me the truth.

145
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,440
Did something happen?

146
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,490
Kexin.

147
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,310
From now on,

148
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:16,360
don't ask about anything or anyone

149
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,340
that is related to Dakun.

150
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,410
If anyone approaches you

151
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,040
under Dakun's name,

152
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,840
you have to tell me.

153
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,910
I'll send someone to protect you.

154
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,890
This is not a joke.

155
00:09:28,510 --> 00:09:29,430
Do you understand?

156
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,380
Mr. Dakun has been arrested, hasn't he?

157
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:38,140
You're still acting.

158
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,990
I'm not stupid.

159
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,920
Do you really think I don't know anything?

160
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,520
You're dealing drugs.

161
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,410
Fine.

162
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:56,000
Read this if you won't tell me.

163
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,230
These are all Mr. Dakun's men.

164
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,300
They've been arrested for drug dealing.

165
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,280
Are you still telling me

166
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:06,340
you're not related to this matter at all?

167
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,190
How do you explain that?

168
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,600
Dad.

169
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,800
Three years ago, when I was kidnapped,

170
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,580
why did my face become the way it is now?

171
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,910
What did I go through?

172
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,760
You know that better than anyone.

173
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,960
Are you still going to lie to me?

174
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,840
Okay.

175
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,180
What do you want from me?

176
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:39,170
I just don't want you

177
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,490
to continue doing this.

178
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,230
Mr. Dakun has been arrested.

179
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,430
What if he accidentally reveals something?

180
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,970
Aren't you afraid?

181
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,290
Actually, I've already thought about it.

182
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,350
I can't hide this from you anymore.

183
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,990
Dakun and I have been close friends

184
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,960
for over ten years.

185
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,820
He won't sell me out.

186
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,620
Dad.

187
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,010
I'm begging you.

188
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,590
Stop it.

189
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,150
I had been abroad alone for years.

190
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:15,990
Why did I come back?

191
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,370
What do I want?

192
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,870
You know that.

193
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,590
Please stop.

194
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:24,970
Dad.

195
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,130
Back then,

196
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,650
I sent you and your mom away.

197
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,560
It was to protect both of you.

198
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,240
Actually...

199
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,190
Even before you were born,

200
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,710
I had already been in this business.

201
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,480
After I entered this industry,

202
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,030
I realized

203
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,600
that there's no turning back.

204
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,050
Don't worry.

205
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,900
I promise you.

206
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:08,620
I'll be with you forever.

207
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,800
I'll make sure you live a happy life.

208
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:17,500
You may go now.

209
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,510
I want to talk to Mr. Glasses.

210
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,220
Don't forget

211
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,720
what you promise me.

212
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,110
Don't forget.

213
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,380
Glasses.

214
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,680
Sir.

215
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,290
Get someone to kill Dakun right away.

216
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,220
Listen carefully.

217
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,220
Do it immediately. Right now!

218
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,000
Yes.

219
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,230
Do as I say.

220
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,900
Thank you for your help.

221
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,810
There's always a way out.

222
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,160
Officer.

223
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,370
I want to see your superior.

224
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,540
I have something important to confess.

225
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,460
Go ahead. What do you want to say?

226
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:31,310
[Officer.]

227
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,930
[Let me ask you something.]

228
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,740
[Which is more important to you cops?]

229
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,600
[Your friends or the criminals?]

230
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,710
Stop your nonsense.

231
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,130
We are comrades.

232
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,860
How can we be compared to criminals?

233
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,350
You should speak more sincerely.

234
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,420
Don't talk nonsense
and waste everyone's time.

235
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:50,140
Okay.

236
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:54,100
Then let's be honest.

237
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,720
I want to make a deal with you.

238
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:01,360
A deal?

239
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,200
What's the deal?

240
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:04,220
Drugs?

241
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,150
It's okay.

242
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,560
I would like to hear about it.

243
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,890
What deal do you want to make?

244
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:12,880
Did one of your cops

245
00:15:12,970 --> 00:15:15,260
go missing while he was on duty?

246
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,640
How dare you spy on me?

247
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,020
I'll kill you!

248
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,340
Same old rules.

249
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,590
Where is Mr. Zhao?

250
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,530
He's alive.

251
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,120
I let him live.

252
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,100
But...

253
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,040
I can also kill him whenever I want.

254
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,450
It's your choice.

255
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,460
You...

256
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,180
I need you to tell me

257
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:46,720
where he is right now!

258
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:47,730
Or else...

259
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,880
Or else what?

260
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,870
Officer, I advise you to calm down.

261
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,410
We have time,

262
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,340
so think about my suggestion.

263
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,580
Three days.

264
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,830
I'll give you three days
to think about it.

265
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,260
If after three days,

266
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,110
I'm still locked up in here,

267
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,700
the deal will be off.

268
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,590
By then,

269
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,540
I can no longer guarantee his safety.

270
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:29,490
Director Liu, we've checked on it.

271
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,990
He was really holding
yesterday's newspaper.

272
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,710
From the scene,

273
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,650
it's hard to determine
the surrounding location.

274
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,320
It's obvious Dakun was well-prepared

275
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,990
for countersurveillance.

276
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,250
He's obviously using that
to bargain for his life.

277
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:43,870
He wouldn't lie.

278
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:47,040
He must have planned to use this
as his escape route since the beginning.

279
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,240
He has planned to use Zhao Nan

280
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,310
to negotiate with the police.

281
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:52,670
He also said

282
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,570
that he would only give us three days.

283
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,970
I don't care if it's three days

284
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,070
or three hours.

285
00:16:57,430 --> 00:16:59,450
As long as our comrade is still alive,

286
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,390
we will do our best to rescue him.

287
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,570
Rong Yao.

288
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:03,850
From now on,

289
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:06,050
your priority is to rescue Zhao Nan.

290
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,119
I'll have the whole task force
cooperate with you.

291
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,089
Understood.

292
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,230
But that won't be of much help

293
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,349
to rescue Zhao Nan.

294
00:17:16,609 --> 00:17:17,970
I know what you want to say.

295
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,140
However, Liu Yuanwen's job is undercover,

296
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,290
not saving our comrades.

297
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:24,400
If he does that,

298
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,250
he will risk getting exposed.

299
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:30,470
Time is running out.

300
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,880
We only have three days.

301
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,420
Please reconsider.

302
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,680
From now on,

303
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,270
we will be fully in charge
of the operation to rescue Zhao Nan.

304
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,680
-Mr. Bao.
-Yes.

305
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:45,780
Interrogate Xiaofoye.

306
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,410
Get something useful out of him.

307
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,080
-Okay.
-Zheng Ke, Zhao Ran.

308
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:50,180
Keep Dakun occupied.

309
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,460
-Yes.
-Got it.

310
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:52,510
Get to work.

311
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,430
What about me?

312
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,620
You haven't slept for two days.

313
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,000
I'll give you a half-day off.
Go home and sleep.

314
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:10,110
I'm not tired. I don't need to rest.

315
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,600
Then tell me.

316
00:18:15,130 --> 00:18:16,050
What do you want to do?

317
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,200
I have a lot on my mind right now.

318
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,310
Let me think about it.

319
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:25,510
Next...

320
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,140
Look at your current state of mind.

321
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,590
What can you do?

322
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,570
But Zhao Nan is my mentor.

323
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,310
First, I want you to go home and rest
so you can execute your mission better.

324
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,280
That is an order.

325
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,830
Second, it's because
Zhao Nan is your mentor.

326
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:40,380
You're not thinking rationally anymore.

327
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,140
How are you going to rescue him?

328
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,690
Trust me this once.

329
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,860
I will bring him back.

330
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,420
Go home and rest, okay?

331
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,710
Go on.

332
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:20,470
How did it go?

333
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,480
Captain Rong.

334
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:23,150
I've interrogated Xiaofoye thoroughly.

335
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,170
He doesn't know where they hid Zhao Nan.

336
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,850
Even he was surprised

337
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:29,050
that Dakun kept him alive as a backup.

338
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:32,610
It seems like this video clip

339
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,070
is our only clue.

340
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,220
Pause. Rewind.

341
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,030
What's wrong?

342
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,390
Is something wrong?

343
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,360

00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,230
This cold chain

513
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:11,690
was originally Dakun's transport station.

514
00:30:12,570 --> 00:30:13,500
Before this,

515
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,490
it has always been managed
by the three of us.

516
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,380
But now,

517
00:30:19,170 --> 00:30:20,710
his men are managing it.

518
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,040
Who is that?

519
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,090
Which of you is Li Ruosheng?

520
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:41,260
There's someone here
who actually recognizes me.

521
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,870
Let me go!

522
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,590
You scared me.

523
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:03,220
Who is this?

524
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:04,890
He's Xiaowei,

525
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:06,650
the person in charge of Arctic Cold Chain.

526
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,540
He's Dakun's godson.

527
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,590
Xiaowei.

528
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,040
Why do you look like
Dakun's biological son?

529
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,530
I am his son.

530
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,900
He gave me my life.

531
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,620
If you put it that way,

532
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,160
I understand it now.

533
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,940
So in order to avenge Dakun,

534
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,310
you're willing
to give up your life, right?

535
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,290
But why do you come at us?

536
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,960
The police caught Dakun.

537
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,550
Go and take revenge on the police.

538
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,130
You two are the ones I am looking for.

539
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,200
Mr. Dakun is my savior.

540
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,520
I knew it long ago.

541
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,500
You two are always against him.

542
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,920
Today, you will pay with your lives!

543
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:48,930
Let me go!

544
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,010
Xiaowei, right?

545
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,080
We're only here today

546
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:55,930
to take over Dakun's business

547
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,480
It's so that our fellow brothers here

548
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,640
could have a better life.

549
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:02,000
You're trying to bribe me?

550
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,120
Let's see how capable you are.

551
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,020
How do we prove that?

552
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,700
One of you has to beat me.

553
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,420
We'll talk from there. Come on!

554
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,060
Let's do some exercise then.

555
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,430
Come on, get up.

556
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,840
I'll see you at the meeting tomorrow.

557
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,170
Test.

558
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,460
Double kill.

559
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:47,250
The winner is Mu Qing.

560
00:33:47,690 --> 00:33:49,270
-Good one.
-Nice.

561
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,280
Come on.

562
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:51,870
Let's gather around.

563
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,800
-Come here.
-Here.

564
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,740
You guys too, come here.

565
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,470
Mr. Mu.

566
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,610
Officer, what time is it?

567
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,699
Why do you ask?

568
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,980
Three days' time is almost up.

569
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,800
Don't say I didn't warn you.

570
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,080
Come in.

571
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:56,460
Director Liu, you asked for me?

572
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,470
Have a seat.

573
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:01,340
We have news from Yuanwen.

574
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,500
We can roughly estimate that Zhao Nan

575
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:05,340
is at the Arctic Cold Chain's storage.

576
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,590
But I need more information.

577
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,140
I need your cooperation to confirm that.

578
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:11,720
I understand.

579
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,430
It's Director Wang.

580
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,400
Answer it.

581
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,300
Hello, Director Wang.

582
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,110
[Rong Yao, where are you?]

583
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:24,000
I'm at Director Liu's office.

584
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,850
[Put your speaker on.]

585
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,030
Okay.

586
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:31,920
Director Wang.

587
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:34,690
[Director Liu, I have to inform you.]

588
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,230
The top-notch spy

589
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,690
the Provincial Public Security Bureau sent

590
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,930
to infiltrate Group K

591
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,990
can be deployed now.

592
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:44,850
His code name is Skylark.

593
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:46,390
Skylark?

594
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:47,930
[You must remember.]

595
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,780
[Under the background]

596
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:52,730
[of increasing globalization
of drug problem,]

597
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:54,750
the intrusion of foreign drugs

598
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:58,270
and the increase of local drugs production

599
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,590
have become very critical.

600
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:00,960
[So...]

601
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:04,430
[We have to fully destroy Group K]

602
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:05,530
[and arrest Spectre.]

603
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,900
We have to stop foreign drugs

604
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,320
from entering our country.

605
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,680
We have to win

606
00:36:10,770 --> 00:36:12,710
this battle of drug prohibition.

607
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:14,600
Understood.

608
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,040
Skylark.

609
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,470
I must inform Yuanwen

610
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,050
about this immediately.

611
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:28,500
Gather your men now

612
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,260
and head to Arctic Cold Chain's storage.

613
00:36:30,350 --> 00:36:31,270
Yes, sir.

614
00:36:42,050 --> 00:36:43,810
Arctic Cold Chain storage?

615
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:47,820
This place must be Dakun's secret base.

616
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,270
When we get there,

617
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,420
we'll assign tasks
based on the actual situation.

618
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,390
Okay.

619
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,960
Do I need to identify myself with him now?

620
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,850
Skylark will approach you.

621
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,890
What you need to do now is to be patient.

622
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:37,620
We can confirm
that this cold chain storage

623
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,940
is where Zhao Nan is held.

624
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,090
It's remote out here.

625
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,100
There isn't much crowd.

626
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,730
It's perfect for holding a hostage.

627
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,760
Captain Rong, should we break in?

628
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:46,730
We can't do that.

629
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,180
We haven't finished scouting yet.

630
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:49,370
What about my mentor?

631
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,520
He might be in more danger.

632
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,320
Yimeng, don't be too anxious.

633
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:54,390
Let's wait until Zhao Ran
comes back from scouting.

634
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,910
Sir.

635
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,190
Excuse me, sir.

636
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,700
Excuse me, sir.

637
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,980
Can I borrow the toilet?

638
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:15,990
Sir.

639
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,550
Captain Rong.

640
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,160
-How was it?
-That security guard is too tough.

641
00:38:34,290 --> 00:38:35,790
I couldn't even make it inside.

642
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:37,420
This cold chain company looks like

643
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,960
it's closed down from the outside.

644
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,810
But the electricity meter
is still running.

645
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,740
-Is the electricity consumption high?
-No.

646
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:44,110
I looked into it earlier.

647
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:46,350
This cold chain company
was registered eight years ago.

648
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,070
But their business hasn't been doing well.

649
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:49,690
They have changed five bosses.

650
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:52,290
Recently, there's only one same truck

651
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:53,920
going in and out for delivery.

652
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,020
It's a bit strange.

653
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,820
Was it the one that just left?

654
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:57,830
Yes.

655
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,080
Someone is here.

656
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,320
Something is definitely up.

657
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:10,460
Let's go and take a look.

658
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,090
Boss.

659
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,540
Come on.

660
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,300
Cheers.

661
00:39:57,540 --> 00:39:59,260
Hello, who is this?

662
00:40:00,050 --> 00:40:01,410
Did you avoid me on purpose?

663
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,660
Are you coming to today's meeting?

664
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:05,990
Mr. Mu.

665
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:08,360
I'm not feeling well today.

666
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:09,820
I'm afraid I can't go out.

667
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:11,440
You're sick?

668
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:12,720
That's good.

669
00:40:12,850 --> 00:40:14,480
I'll bring some fruits to visit you.

670
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:16,240
If you're able to find me,

671
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,600
then you're quite good.

672
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,320
I'll be waiting for your fruits then.

673
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,470
He really thinks he's the boss.

674
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,360
Why should I listen to you?

675
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,080
Boss.

676
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:33,270
What a lousy game.

677
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,780
There are a few electricians outside.

678
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,060
Electricians?

679
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:40,790
Why so sudden?

680
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,510
Who asks them to come?

681
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,530
It wasn't me.

682
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,760
It wasn't me.

683
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:46,770
Then...

684
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:50,870
Hurry, go and take a look.

685
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:51,920
Come on.

686
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:02,000
This is our warehouse.

687
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,050
Move aside.

688
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,250
Search this place.

689
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:10,010
This way.

690
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:19,690
-Captain Rong.
-How is it?

691
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:20,830
I found nothing.

692
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:26,990
What about you?

693
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,180
I've looked everywhere.

694
00:41:28,270 --> 00:41:30,030
There's no place to hold a hostage here.

695
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:39,660
["Never Say Goodbye" playing]

696
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:54,930
♫ In the evening, by the serene beach ♫

697
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:01,750
♫ From my camera,
you're looking at the shore ♫

698
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:08,790
♫ I hope our hearts will never sway ♫

699
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,920
♫ I want to fill my world up with you ♫

700
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,310
♫ If love is
the destination of wandering ♫

701
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:29,950
♫ Your smile blurs my sight ♫

702
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:37,040
♫ At this moment, I am lost for words ♫

703
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,030
♫ Close your eyes slowly ♫

704
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:44,430
♫ And let me kiss the edge of your nose ♫

705
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:49,580
♫ The wind blows past me as I zone out ♫

706
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:53,050
♫ When I turn around,
I lose you in the midst of a crowd ♫

707
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,480
♫ You are a teardrop away ♫

708
00:42:56,570 --> 00:43:00,050
♫ And I shall quietly wait ♫

709
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:03,520
♫ If love never leaves us ♫

710
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:07,130
♫ This beautiful encounter ♫

711
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:10,260
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

712
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:14,880
♫ Say goodbye ♫

713
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:28,430
♫ The wind blows past you
as you zone out ♫

714
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:31,950
♫ Suddenly, I realized ♫

715
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:35,470
♫ What we experience is love ♫

716
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:39,120
♫ And time is my love confession ♫

717
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:42,590
♫ If love ever comes ♫

718
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:46,110
♫ It's the sweetest thing
I look forward to ♫

719
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:49,150
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

720
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:52,320
♫ Say goodbye ♫

721
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:57,730
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

722
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,780
♫ Say goodbye ♫
