Her family filed a report.

14

Not a single light is turned on.

Does anyone live here?

33

It's the address given by the bureau.

34
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:17,920
Do you think they knew we were coming,

35

so they already moved her?

36

They're so quick.

Maybe it was old news.

There's another possibility.

Someone could have tipped off

the people in the villa.

59
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:40,110
So they got scared before we arrived.

60

But who could be so resourceful?

61
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:45,780

Is it the border or abroad?

107

Is it somewhere outside
of our group's influence?

108
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,820

Since Dakun, Xiaofoye, and Tieguanyin

165

faced mishaps one after another,

166
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:24,870
the group's backbone

167
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,120
is just a few of you here.

168

I invited you all today

173

to unify our minds

174
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,870
and tie all of us together firmly.

00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,110
As you all know,

176
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:51,310
the group is now facing

177
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,850
its life or death moment.

178
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,480
So...

179
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,550
I'd like to redistribute
the responsibilities

180
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:57,870
within the group.

181
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,510
We should resume our business operations

182
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,560
as soon as possible.

183
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,980
First of all,

184
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,140
it's Tieguanyin's business.

185
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,610
Who can take over?

186
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,320
Sir.

187
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,030
I think

188
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:26,380
Congtou has the most experience.

189
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,100
He used to transport the raw materials.

190
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,080
He knows the production process.

191
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,640
As for Ruosheng and Mu Qing,

192
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,190
they've just taken over Dakun's business.

193
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:38,390
If we let them handle other things,

194
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,710
they'll get distracted.

195
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,320
So for setting up the new factory,

196
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,040
Congtou is the best candidate.

197
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,000
You flatter me, Mr. Glasses.

198
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,150
Sir, you know it.

199
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:58,060
I'm used to running around outside.

200
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,430
I can't stay in one place.

201
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,320
But Mr. Glasses is different.

202
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,520
He's in Yungang all the time.

203
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:06,720
Firstly, he can take care of the factory.

204
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:07,740
Secondly,

205
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,850
if something happens to the factory,

206
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:12,360
he can discuss it with you in time.

207
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,070
I think

208
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:17,990
Glasses is more suitable for it.

209
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,980
I only know internal management.

210
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:23,130
I don't know much about business.

211
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:24,450
Mr. Glasses.

212
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:27,050
Being overly humble is arrogance.

213
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,870
You said you don't know much,

214
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,560
but no one else knows it better than you.

215
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,370
Congtou.

216
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,530
If you're free,

217
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,250
let's have tea and grab a bite later.

218
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,550
What's wrong?

219
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,890
Recently, you seem to be in a bad mood.

220
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,120
Is something bothering you?

221
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,960
What's up, Ruosheng?

222
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,500
No, Congtou.

223
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,700
Tell me, within the group,

224
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:05,640
we're on good terms.

225
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:07,440
I owe you a debt of gratitude.

226
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,940
If something is bothering you

227
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,130
or if there's any problem,

228
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,140
you can tell me.

229
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,900
I'll do my best to help.

230
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,330
Take care, Congtou.

231
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,280
[During a critical time like this,]

232
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,080
a few words can win over a person.

233
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,370
Don't you think it's a good deal?

234
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,329
It's thanks to your cunningness.

235
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:05,339
It was well-thought-out.

236
00:17:07,369 --> 00:17:09,040
But I don't understand.

237
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:11,020
What exactly happened

238
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,470
between Glasses and Congtou?

239
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,720
In front of Godfather today,

240
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,260
they were recommending each other

241
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,980
to take over Tieguanyin's drug factory.

242
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,520
It was a two-man show.

243
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,640
I don't understand.

244
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:25,099
Isn't it simple?

245
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,990
Congtou loses.

246
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,220
Glasses wins.

247
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,290
It's just that Congtou threw away

248
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,840
such a huge slice of cake easily.

249
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,750
Glasses must have some dirt on him.

250
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,360
That means Glasses have the advantage.

251
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,470
Judging from the situation,

252
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,980
Glasses probably found

253
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,520
something interesting.

254
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,860
Would he tell Godfather about it?

255
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,630
In this line of business,

256
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,100
profits come first, harmony second.

257
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,510
They're allies if there's a profit.

258
00:17:56,870 --> 00:17:58,050
The shared profit

259
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,990
is their unbreakable foundation.

260
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,630
What comes next

261
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,700
could be a real war.

262
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,130
Glasses has convinced Congtou now.

263
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,610
He might come after us next.

264
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,560
Have you figured out how to deal with it?

265
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,460
Let's be like Jiang Ziya.

266
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,620
It depends on whether Congtou

267
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,940
will take the bait or not.

268
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,530
You're a busy man.

269
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,250
Why are you free today?

270
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:51,470
Is it work-related or personal?

271
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,510
That question sounds like a trap.

272
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,840
There's no right answer to it.

273
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,010
Be it work or personal,

274
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:01,280
it's about time we meet.

275
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,900
That's a solid 100-point answer.

276
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,660
Here.

277
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,130
Cheers.

278
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,100
What does that mean?

279
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,780
It's "cheers" in French.

280
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,920
Say it.

281
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:15,980
Cheers.

282
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,240
You're no fun.

283
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,910
Did you get the news?

284
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,430
Are you serious?

285
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,020
I haven't even started eating.

286
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:38,110
Fine. Business first.

287
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,480
I heard my dad telling Mr. Glasses

288
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,330
to do a wire transfer to Spectre

289
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,960
through an underground bank.

290
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,590
They want to tie him down.

291
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:46,910
Tie him down?

292
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,590
From the sound of it,

293
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,530
they must invite him to Yungang.

294
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,190
It seems Mr. Ou is losing patience too.

295
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:57,690
Yes.

296
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,020
Although so many things happened to him,

297
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,000
he still has to do business.

298
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,950
My dad is good at keeping it under wraps.

299
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,490
Plus, there isn't much time.

300
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,260
I couldn't obtain any other information.

301
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:13,000
As for Spectre, it's just like its name.

302
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,070
We hear his name,
but he's nowhere to be seen.

303
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:18,280
That's it. I have nothing else.

304
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,780
Am I useless?

305
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,460
You're not useless.

306
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,350
Here's to you.

307
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:30,030
Is this drink work-related or personal?

308
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,750
Take a guess.

309
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,900
Cheers.

310
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:46,570
I'm wondering

311
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,340
if there's a way we can get our hands

312
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,970
on Mr. Glasses's underground bank's

313
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,980
remittance route?

314
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,960
This should be a breakthrough.

315
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,850
That's what I thought too.

316
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,190
But we have to take it step by step.

317
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,720
Okay, I'll wait to hear from you.

318
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,910
Can I eat now?

319
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,360
Eat up.

320
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,110
I can't stand you.

321
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,630
Why are you sighing at me like that?

322
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,920
I was just sighing for your dad.

323
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,390
What do you mean?

324
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,930
Your dad has such a good daughter.

325
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:37,570
Are you going to let me eat or not?

326
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,770
Eat up. I didn't stop you from eating.

327
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:45,970
Eating with you is so tiring.

328
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,950
But since you ordered

329
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,310
all my favorite dishes,

330
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,630
you're quite considerate.

331
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,700
They're my favorite dishes too.

332
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,930
Have some tea.

333
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,600
Thank you, sir.

334
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,630
What's going on?

335
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,710
Are you not taking over the factory?

336
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,290
Sir.

337
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,840
I should just do my job.

338
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,850
So you're dumping the problem on me.

339
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:34,590
How about this?

340
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,140
I'll do as you say.

341
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,090
You old foxes.

342
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,200
I know what you guys are thinking.

343
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,610
Every one of you

344
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,800
has a trick up your sleeves.

345
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,450
Learn from those two youngsters.

346
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,170
They have done well.

347
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,190
Do your job earnestly.

348
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,040
Watch and learn.

349
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,270
Yes.

350
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:02,480
Sir, I accept your criticism.

351
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,290
Are you still watching those three?

352
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,230
Don't worry, sir.

353
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,160
I'm watching them.

354
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,370
We can't wait anymore.

355
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,690
We must find the mole

356
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,060
before Spectre reaches Yungang.

357
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,480
Otherwise, there will be a disaster.

358
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:25,710
Yes.

359
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,220
Okay.

360
00:23:28,790 --> 00:23:31,480
Don't worry about the factory.

361
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,730
Thank you, sir.

362

[I have a message from Mr. Ou.]

363

Before we find the mole,

364
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,080
no one can leave Yungang.

365

00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,180
about the incident,

368
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,810
then...

369
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,210
Xiaoyue and your baby won't live.

370
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,370
Where's Xiaoyue?

371
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,380
I want to see her.

372
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:47,110
Congtou.

373
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:48,960
I have experts

374
00:24:49,050 --> 00:24:50,460
serving and taking care of her.

375
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,800
She's eating and living well.

376
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,340
Don't worry.

377
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,840
I'll give you 30% of the company shares.

378
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,220
Xiaoyue will be
the registered shareholder.

379
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:05,860
Do you have any problem with that?

380
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,730
Mr. Glasses.

381
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,160
Right now,

382
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,790
even if I'm unwilling,

383
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,020
I'm in the same boat as you.

384
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,650
You have nothing to worry about.

385
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,810
I just want to see my Xiaoyue.

386
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,860
Can't I?

387
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,900
Xiaoyue is giving birth soon.

388
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,790
She can't move around that much.

389
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:31,290
As for you,

390
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,700
together with me,

391
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,760
we must do a good job.

392
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,430
That's your specialty.

393
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,050
Wait.

394
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,770
What you're saying is

395
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,530
if our business fails

396
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,810
and the company loses money,

397
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,140
I'll never see them my entire life, right?

398
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:50,510
Isn't this obviously a threat?

399
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,730
I want to see Xiaoyue now.

400
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,540
I can't eat or drink.

401
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,550
I can't sleep at night.

402
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,830
I couldn't sleep a wink!

403
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,060
Do you know what it's like?

404
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,600
What's wrong with letting me see her

405
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:02,830
and ensure her safety?

406
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,500
Otherwise, I can't do anything.

407
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,040
There's nothing I can do!

408
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:18,890
Okay, let's do this.

409
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,870
In three days,

410
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:22,500
I'll set up a meeting.

411
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,540
But let me remind you.

412
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,560
Don't try anything funny.

413
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,730
What an idiot.

414
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,420
Hey.

415
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:06,810
You were right.

416
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,580
Congtou willingly took the bait.

417
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,750
He must want to talk to you.

418
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:14,020
Let's meet him.

419
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:17,280

You asked us to come here.

426
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,260
What's going on?

427
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,400
Save someone for me.

428
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,460
Once it's done,

429
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,370
I'll give all the sources I have

430

to you on a platter.

431
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:46,500
Who do you want to save?

432
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,540
My wife.

433
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,260
She's pregnant with my child.

434
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,450
She was captured?

435
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,640
Who captured her?

436
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,220
Glasses.

437
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,030
They went to my house

438
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,410
and kidnapped her.

439
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,890
You have a purchasing pipeline.

440
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:14,610
As for Glasses,

441
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,110
he has taken over the drug factory.

442
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,000
He definitely did this

443
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,110
to work with you.

444
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,890
Is that called "working together"?

445
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,270
That's an obvious threat.

446
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,170
To be honest,

447
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,760
I don't want to be

448
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:32,120
in this industry anymore.

449
00:28:32,870 --> 00:28:33,930
Take a look.

00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:35,690
Dakun,

451

Xiaofoye, and Tieguanyin.

452
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,970
Look what happened to them.

453
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:43,030
Who will be next?

454
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,710
Will it be me?

455
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,110
Or will it be you two?

456
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,930
I'm scared now.

457
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:51,480
I already have a wife.

458
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,770
My wife is carrying my child.

459
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,310
I'm going to be a dad soon.

460
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,250
I just want to live in peace

461
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:58,260
with my family.

462
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,990
Otherwise, no matter
how much money I make,

463
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,830
what's the point
if I can't live to spend it?

464
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:04,640
So...

465
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:08,380
all the sources I have

466
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:12,340
are just worldly possessions to me now.

467
00:29:13,130 --> 00:29:14,140
But no matter what,

468
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:15,420
I can't give them to Glasses.

469
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,180
What kind of person is Glasses?

470
00:29:17,570 --> 00:29:18,720
He seeks nothing but profits.

471
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,010
Family means nothing to him

472
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,190
when it comes to money.

473
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,600
In an overall view,

474
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,540
if I give him my sources,

475
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,340
I'll be breaking the code

476
00:29:27,430 --> 00:29:28,530
of the whole industry.

477
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,200
In my personal view,

478
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:32,180
if I give them to him,

479
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,540
I'll be useless.

480
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,520
He'll kill me easily.

481
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,310
You two won't end well either.

482
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,080
So my friends,

483
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:45,690
helping me means helping yourselves.

484
00:29:50,570 --> 00:29:51,890
How can we help you?

485
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,500
In three days,

486
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,960
I'll arrange a ship

487
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:02,940
to leave this port.

488
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,300
Mr. Glasses, be careful.

[Baitutang Cafe and Bistro]

00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:38,110
Have some coffee.

492
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:40,130
The coffee here is pretty good.

Where's my Xiaoyue?

495
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,190
Before you meet Xiaoyue,

496
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,410
you have to promise to work with me.

Don't give me that nonsense.

I want to see my Xiaoyue first.

500
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,020
It's not convenient for Xiaoyue to come.

501
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:09,340
So...

502
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,340
you can only see Xiaoyue

00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,790
"Video call"?

506
