[Episode 29]

3
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,340
You fooled us all.

4
00:01:36,039 --> 00:01:37,360
You won't walk out of here alive.

5
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,330
Godfather.

6
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:40,270
Didn't you promise me not to kill him yet?

7
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,810
You still haven't figured it out?

8
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,440
He's the mole.

9
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,860
Do you know why he targeted Kexin?

10
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,320
He's using Kexin as his shield.

11
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:49,289
Do you see it now?

12
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,300
Sir.

13
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,710
I'm not a mole.

14
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,289
When it comes to me and Kexin,

15
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:54,660
it was Kexin who approached me.

16
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,060
It has nothing to do with me.

17
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:58,570
That's just how she is.
You know that perfectly well.

18
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,890
Godfather, I can be his witness.

19
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,610
Kexin was the one who made the first move.

20
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,540
There's actually nothing
going on between them.

21
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,000
Kexin said those things just now

22
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,450
just to save Mu Qing.

23
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:07,420
That's enough.

24
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,600
All I know

25
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,280
everything that happened to the group

26
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,420
was because of him.

27
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,780
If I get rid of him,

28
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,100
all these problems will be gone.

29
00:02:16,130 --> 00:02:17,140
[I'm going in.]

30
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,079
[Rong Yao, if I can't hold out here,]

31
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,480
[set up the rescue right away.]

32
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,450
Okay.

33
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:23,920
Be careful.

34
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,500
[Don't worry.]

35
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,680
Sir.

36
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,220
There are many of us here.

37
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,760
If you execute me

38
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,990
without proper investigation,

39
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,710
how can they continue to follow you?

40
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,470
How can the group keep going?

41
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,550
Killing you is saving our group.

42
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,560
Wait!

43
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:55,460
Kexin?

44
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:00,650
Why are you here?

45
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,330
How dare you ask me how I got here?

46
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,390
You were fooled by him! Don't you know?

47
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,850
I didn't get fooled.

48
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,470
I've liked him all along.

49
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,620
I took the initiative.

50
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,170
Glasses!

51
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,270
Take her away!

52
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:13,680
Don't come any closer!

53
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,610
What are you doing?

54
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,020
You harmed my mom.

55
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:18,210
You even harmed me.

56
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,570
Now, you want to harm my lover.

57
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,200
Dad.

58
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:23,090
I thought you loved me.

59
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,650
In the end, you're just selfish.

60
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,070
You've never been considerate of me.

61
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:29,470
From now on,

62
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:31,500
if any of you hurt Mu Qing,

63
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,170
it means you're picking a fight with me!

64
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,400
Kexin, you...

65
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,070
If you hurt Mu Qing,

66
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,660
I'll kill myself.

67
00:03:37,829 --> 00:03:38,930
Mu Qing, let's go.

68
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,250
What are you doing?

69
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,320
Where are you going?

70
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,320
Move aside.

71
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,130
Release Congtou.

72
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,600
Send someone to keep an eye on them now.

73
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,520
Tell Luotuo to work harder

74
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,890
and find the mole quickly.

75
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,260
Retreat.

76
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,660
Kexin.

77
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:04,420
Thank you.

78
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,880
It's my fault for liking you.

79
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:13,050
You're still joking around

80
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,280
at a time like this?

81
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,570
Sir.

82
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,720
You stayed up all night.

83
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,390
Get some rest.

84
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,570
Are you still worried about Kexin?

85
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,990
No matter how hard I tried,

86
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,350
I couldn't prevent it.

87
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,120
Maybe only Tieguanyin knows

88
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,660
who the mole is.

89
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,530
Tell Officer Zheng to think of something.

90
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:26,390
Have some water.

91
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:28,810
Thank you.

92
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:39,150
Rong Yao.

93
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,670
Are we interrogating Tieguanyin?

94
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,320
Our top priority now is to save Xiaoxiao.

95
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,640
So...

96
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,680
Captain Rong, Glasses is calling.

97
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,740
Wiretap.

98
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,040
Hello.

99
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:00,930
Did you find the mole?

100
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,850
Tieguanyin isn't saying anything.

101
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,300
I couldn't look into it.

102
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:08,680
If she wouldn't talk,

103
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,790
you can figure out a way to make her talk.

104
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,690
The whole police station is watching her.

105
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,160
I can't get close to her.

106
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,830
Zheng Ke.

107
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,030
I'm telling you.

108
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,800
[I have high hopes for you.]

109
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,870
[So...]

110
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,460
[Alter evidence]

111
00:07:25,350 --> 00:07:27,460
[you need to use your brain.]

112
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,920
[Don't disappoint me.]

113
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,160
Otherwise,
you'll be even more disappointed.

114
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,659
[Hang on.]

115
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,560
What's the matter?

116
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,540
Did you figure out a way?

117
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,360
Although I can't get close to Tieguanyin,

118
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,210
I can try to alter

119
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,460
the incriminating evidence against her.

120
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,590
You mean

121
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,740
if you change the evidence,

122
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,370
the police won't be able

123
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,820
to complete the chain of custody.

124
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,920
Yes.

125
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,430
[Zheng Ke, let me tell you.]

126
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,720
[I want results.]

127
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,130
[I don't care about the process.]

128
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,580
I'll give you one day.

129
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,040
Captain Rong.

130
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:18,240
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

131
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,220
I'll report this operation plan

132
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,580
to Director Liu.

133
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,120
Don't worry.

134
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,370
We'll do everything we can

135
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,130
to save Xiaoxiao.

136
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,400
It's risky.

137
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,260
I know.

138
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,409
Once we release Tieguanyin,

139
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,530
Glasses will protect her.

140
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,860
It will be hard to control her after that.

141
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,290
Also, if we mess up,

142
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,870
I can't imagine

143
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,240
what would happen to Xiaoxiao.

144
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,820
I know all of that.

145
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,110
Since you know it,

146
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,930
why did you make this plan?

147
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,820
I trust my team members.

148
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,850
I'm very confident about their abilities.

149
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,400
I'm confident they can pull it off.

150
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:07,380
Director Liu.

151
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,540
We just need your permission.

152
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,640
Xiaoxiao is very sick.

153
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,280
We can't delay this any longer.

154
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,870
At the moment,

155
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,600
only your plan seems feasible.

156
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,450
How about this?

157
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:30,130
I'll explain to the higher-ups.

158
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:32,160
Just proceed with your plan.

159
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,710
I'll bear full responsibility
if a problem occurs.

160
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,340
Don't worry.

161
00:09:36,860 --> 00:09:37,740
I'll get it done.

162
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,760
What do you want to ask me now?

163
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,170
Tell me.

164
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,520
My answer is the same anyway.

165
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,460
How long are you going to keep me?

166
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,010
Why don't you give me a blanket?

167
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:31,470
I'm telling you.

168
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,050
We're strictly following protocol

169
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,280
in this interrogation.

170
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,870
If you're tired,

171
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,930
just cooperate with us.

172
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:39,830
How about this?

173
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,950
I'll loosen the cuffs on your hand.

00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:43,120
Don't worry, Kexin.

515
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,710
From today onward,

516
00:34:44,929 --> 00:34:46,159
something like that

517
00:34:46,730 --> 00:34:48,489
will never happen again.

518
00:34:49,370 --> 00:34:50,600
I won't let him go anywhere.

519
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,200
Mr. Glasses, I'll go with you.

520
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:59,750
Kexin.

521
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,950
Let's not make things difficult
for Mr. Glasses.

522
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,330
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

523
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:09,080
I'll wait for you to come back.

524
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:19,070
Hello.

525
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,140
Mu Qing has been taken away by Glasses.

526
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,470
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

527
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,070
Why are you sighing?

528
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,380
You've used up all your energy

529
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,660
to get rid of me.

530
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,680
Mr. Glasses.

531
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,750
Why can't you let me be?

532
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,600
Don't get me wrong.

533
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,190
I'm just following Mr. Ou's orders.

534
00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,620
Ruosheng told me everything.

535
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,820
Mr. Ou told you to spare my life.

536
00:36:01,350 --> 00:36:02,980
But you still insisted on killing me.

537
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,820
I don't worry as much as Mr. Ou.

538
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:09,840
In our line of work,

539
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:11,340
if anything goes wrong,

540
00:36:11,430 --> 00:36:12,840
we'll lose our lives.

541
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:14,770
So...

542
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,620
if you're under suspicion,

543
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,380
I would be suspicious of you.

544
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,630
Aren't you afraid

545
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,790
that I might not tolerate you later?

546
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:28,280
There won't be "later."

547
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:35,670
Hello.

548
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:37,470
Glasses, we're in trouble.

549
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,500
The taxi driver took Guanyin away.

550
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,600
What?

551
00:36:43,330 --> 00:36:46,580
Find out where the goods are now.

552
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,550
[Yes.]

553
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,520
Did you lose some goods?

554
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,720
It has nothing to do with you.

555
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:58,420
I think

556
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,000
it wasn't goods that you lost.

557
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,470
To prove that I'm the mole,

558
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,760
you need Guanyin's testimony.

559
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,310
You dragged me out so late at night.

560
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:14,040
You must've gotten some news from Guanyin.

561
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,720
You got her out.

562
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,290
That's right.

563
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,190
I got her out.

564
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,310
It's good that she got out.

565
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:28,340
However,

566
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,010
for a person who went in

567
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,370
and got out,

568
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:34,010
I wonder if Mr. Ou would believe her.

569
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,200
Are you scared?

570
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,830
What am I scared of?

571
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,430
Tieguanyin, get out.

572
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,870
What's the meaning of this?

573
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,360
You'll see.

574
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,120
What a big group.

575
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,410
You're not trying
to arrest me again, are you?

576
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:03,510
Of course not.

577
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,150
Zheng Ke, get ready to call Glasses.

578
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,550
Tell him to meet at the shipyard.

579
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,400
Yimeng, find a sniping spot.

580
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:18,690
You...

581
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,090
Be more cooperative.

582
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:23,570
I...

583
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:25,370
You'd better behave.

584
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,470
Move!

585
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,740
Move out!

586
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,020
What?

587
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,930
You lost her?

588
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,080
What are you doing?

589
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,410
I don't want to hear it.

590
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:44,910
I'm telling you.

591
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,290
I don't care how you'll do it.

592
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,610
You must find her!

593
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,080
Stop the car.

594
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:16,460
Why did you call me?

595
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,350
Tieguanyin is with me.

596
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,010
The taxi driver was you.

597
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:24,290
That's right.

598
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,780
You're heartless,

599
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,240
so don't blame me for being unkind.

600
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,570
[Make a 20km detour south of the highway.]

601
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,200
There's a fishing port by the sea.

602
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,260
I hid her here.

603
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,500
If you want her,

604
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,990
bring Xiaoxiao over.

605
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,250
Do you want to die?

606
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:40,830
In half an hour,

607
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,110
I'm want to meet my daughter

608
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,250
at the fishing port.

609
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,620
Otherwise,

610
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:46,330
with one phone call,

611
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,960
the police will surround this place.

612
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:50,730
By then, you'll never see her again.

613
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,760
The mole you want

614
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,650
will come from Tieguanyin's lips.

615
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:58,610
This mole will destroy the entire Group K.

616
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:01,950
If you don't want to end up like Dakun,

617
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,320
bring my daughter over!

618
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,500
Do you understand?

619
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:22,410
Hello.

620
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:23,950
Shao Nan.

621
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:27,120
Bring the girl to the fishing port.

622
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,010
As soon as you see Luotuo,

623
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,900
kill him and the girl.

624
00:41:30,990 --> 00:41:31,910
Do you understand?
