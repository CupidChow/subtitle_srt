Tell this to Mr. Ou.

10

I sought confirmation
from the people in Paris.

The fire didn't just burn down one house.

12
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,370
It also involved

13
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,910
two villas on the side.

14

The Council of Paris has filed the case.

Once Kexin goes back,

16

there's going to be trouble.

00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,000
How much trouble?

18
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:36,720
It was considered arson.

19
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,700
According to French law,

20
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,890
she'll be sentenced to

21
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,510
at least three years in prison.

It's such a big case.

24
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,040
The judge won't grant bail.

25
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,880
What a troublemaker.

26
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:00,740
No wonder she came back in a hurry.

27
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,460
It's to run away from a lawsuit.

28

Look it up.

29
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:08,480
In which countries can she get a visa?

30

As long as it's not countries around Asia,

00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,340
After that, let's have a meeting

177
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,630
and discuss Jimmy's arrest tonight.

178
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,570
Do you have any questions?

179
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,669
I have a question.

180
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,350
I'll answer your questions.

181
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,760
The rest,

182
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,870
do as Rong Yao says.

183
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:40,630
Come to my office.

184
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:46,830
[Yungang Public Security Bureau]

185
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,850
[Yungang Public Security Bureau]

186
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,370
[Name: Jimmy, Gender: Male,
Birthdate: May 15th, 1976, Age: 42]

187
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:02,230
I'm not convinced.

188
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,330
Why not?

189
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,800
How much does he know
about Yungang's situation?

190
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,780
How much does he know about Group K?

191
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,180
This Group K.

192
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,250
I'm in charge of the whole shebang.

193
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,500
Mr. Liu, why do you trust

194
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,680
an outsider so much?

195
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,400
The mighty dragon is no match

196
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,200
for the native serpent, right?

197
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,610
He's the mighty dragon.

198
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,150
You're the native serpent.

199
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,100
Why do you speak like

200
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,460
you're in a martial arts world?

201
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,400
-It's an analogy.
-What's the point?

202
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,200
Do you think you should be promoted?

203
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,390
Mr. Liu, that's not...

204
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,360
Come in.

205
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,340
Mr. Liu.

206
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:35,270
Am I interrupting?

207
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,080
Rong Yao! Perfect timing.

208
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,050
Here.

209
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,300
Captain Bao.

210
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:42,840
Don't you have something

211
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,070
to tell Rong Yao?

212
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,390
Tell him.

213
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,610
Spectre is like a ghost.

214
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,070
Dozens of countries want to catch him.

215
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,050
He hasn't made a move in two years.

216
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,990
We don't even know what he looks like.

217
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,790
How can you arrest him?

218
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,600
Based on the fact

219
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:08,270
that he'll most likely appear in Yungang.

220
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:09,730
Here's some information.

221
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,000
Take a look.

222
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,380
Are you that sure?

223
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,930
You should read about it first.

224
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,910
I'm very sure.

225
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,760
Rong Yao.

226
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,540
Do you have anything to say?

227
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,480
Captain Bao is an expert.

228
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,590
But he isn't someone I need.

229
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,360
-So, I...
-Whether Captain Bao is an expert or not,

230
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,920
you can't just jump to conclusions.

231
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:50,290
Whether he's someone you need,

232
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,760
you can't decide on that

233
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,560
after meeting him once or twice.

234
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,610
So,

235
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:01,030
Jimmy's arrest

236
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,790
is the beginning

237
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,460
of your candidate selection.

238
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,960
Do what's best.

239
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,420
Mr. Liu.

240
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:09,870
You understand me the most.

241
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,160
I know what's best for me.

242
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,050
I know you too well.

243
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,440
Yours and mine

244
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,600
might not mean the same.

245
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,200
I see.

246
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,110
I hope you really understand what I meant.

247
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,240
For what's best.

248
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,870
Cheers to our three million!

249
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,360
Bottoms up.

250
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,270
What are you doing? Cheers.

251
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,410
What are you doing?

252
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,380
-Come on.
-Bottoms up.

253
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,480
Bottoms up.

254
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,050
Look at how happy you are.

255
00:11:58,310 --> 00:11:59,370
I know that Mr. Ou

256
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:00,730
won't let you leave, right?

257
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,410
Of course.

258
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,080
But the play has to go well.

259
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,180
Don't you agree?

260
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,570
So the incident in France three years ago,

261
00:12:08,650 --> 00:12:09,930
were you acting too?

262
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,380
I don't love acting that much.

263
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:12,970
That one was real.

264
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,520
My boyfriend of three years

265
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,760
flirted with another woman in front of me.

266
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:19,920
I can't grin and bear it.

267
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:22,250
That's why you started the fire.

268
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,790
He was lucky.

269
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,460
I almost burned him up.

270
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,470
That's amazing.

271
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,880
Tell me how you did it.

272
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,240
Are you crazy?

273
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,340
Aren't you afraid?

274
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:32,850
What for? It's so thrilling!

275
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,300
I think

276
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,460
you should pay us the 500,000 back.

277
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:38,750
Make me happy.

278
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,850
Not only 500,000,

279
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,340
but I'll even give you 1 million.

280
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,630
Let's talk again

281
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,170
after you return us the one million.

282
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:47,460
Let's talk again after you make me happy.

283
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:49,700
I'm going to dance.

284
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,680
Our Ms. Ou

285
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,400
is such an outlier.

286
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,360
Spoiled and stubborn.

287
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,820
Do you like her?

288
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,540
What?

289
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,430
Do you like her?

290
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,800
What are you saying?

291
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,140
Tell me what's happening.

292
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,940
Where is she going to stay?

293
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,010
I wanted her to stay with me.

294
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,080
But she chose you.

295
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:23,230
Don't try to trick me.

296
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,080
I need my personal space.

297
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,750
I'm telling you.

298
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,170
It's a set-up from Glasses.

299
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,970
He left the difficult task to us.

300
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:33,170
But after I analyzed it objectively,

301
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,930
staying at your place is better.

302
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:37,880
Aren't you tempted

303
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:39,110
by her all this while?

304
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,570
Let her stay at your place.

305
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:43,160
Temptations are temptations.

306
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,440
She's my godsister.

307
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,670
If she stays at my place,

308
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,250
I can only abide if she bullies me.

309
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,350
How upsetting.

310
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:50,330
What if I have

311
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,520
something else going on?

312
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:52,800
It's inconvenient.

313
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,130
Is my place more convenient?

314
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,360
In your dreams.

315
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,120
She'll stay at your place.

316
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:00,320
You can move into my guest room.

317
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,630
All right.

318
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,310
Let's do as you say.

319
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,010
Shake it!

320
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,040
What's wrong?

321
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:38,200
What are you looking at?

322
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,100
Do you see that Caucasian man over there?

323
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,340
Who's that?

324
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,970
Why is he here?

325
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,320
Ms. Ou, let's go.

326
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,040
I'm still dancing.

327
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:02,840
-Let's go!
-I'm not leaving.

328
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:03,940
What?

329
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:05,090
Bye.

330
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,230
What are you doing?

331
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,120
I'm not done yet.

332
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,580
Do you hear me?

333
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,270
Hurry up. Take a taxi home.

334
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:23,080
You'll be the one driving me home.

335
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:24,180
I'm busy.

336
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,330
Go home by yourself.

337
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,730
Busy?

338
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:29,200
I got it.

339
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:32,370
You're going out with another girl.

340
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,180
Don't you have better things to say?

341
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,590
If that's not the case,

342
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:38,700
take me to the car.

343
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:42,790
It's so dark.

344
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,300
I'm a woman.

345
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,370
I'm scared.

346
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,630
Okay, I'll go with you.

347
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,050
That's right. Let's go.

348
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,710
Did you see that?

349
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,540
Delivery and payment are separate.

350
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,040
They are experts.

351
00:17:41,190 --> 00:17:42,600
Who's this Jimmy?

352
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,640
I saw him once two years ago.

353
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:46,740
Back then,

354
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,500
he was still with Xiaofoye.

355
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,480
Xiaofoye?

356
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,580
Dakun's man.

357
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,890
Is Jimmy still with Xiaofoye now?

358
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,490
I don't know.

359
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,450
A while ago,

360
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,820
I heard he's on the wanted list.

361
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,870
He vanished.

362
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,540
If he's wanted, why did he come out?

363
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:07,900
Do you think

364
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,150
Dakun has his eyes on our VIVI?

365
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,210
Dakun already messed up

366
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,270
some of our turfs.

367
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,730
Right now, VIVI is the hottest one.

368
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,670
If he still has ideas,

369
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:19,340
I can't let that happen.

370
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,390
What should we do next?

371
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,490
I'll sound that Jimmy out.

372
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:31,350
Don't say anything. Watch me.

373
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,100
Jimmy!

374
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:41,520
Hey, man.

375
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:43,230
Long time no see.

376
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,950
-How have you been?
-It has been a while.

377
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,180
Let me introduce you.

378
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:48,290
This is my partner, Mu Qing.

379
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,830
-Mu Qing.
-Jimmy.

380
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,500
I've heard of you.

381
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,740
But I haven't had the chance to meet you.

382
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,420
Your Mandarin is good.

383
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,140
You've been here for many years, right?

384
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,210
I studied abroad in Shanghai.

385
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,190
Why did you come to Yungang

386
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,600
instead of staying in Shanghai?

387
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,970
It's business, as you can see.

388
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,260
Business?

389
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:14,650
This turf isn't for you to do business.

390
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,640
It's only a venue.

391
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,050
Mu Qing.

392
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,160
Don't ruin our friendship.

393
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,730
I have something new.

394
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,580
Why don't you try it?

395
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,710
Go back and tell Xiaofoye.

396
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,070
Tell Dakun.

397
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:33,650
I don't care about the rest.

398
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,250
But this place is off-limits for you guys.

399
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,220
Got it?

400
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,430
But,

401
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:45,140
I'm comfortable here.

402
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,100
I don't want to move.

403
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,600
Are you going to hit me?

404
00:19:55,610 --> 00:19:56,620
You?

405
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,250
I don't have to do it myself.

406
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:20,640
From now on,

407
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,770
we're officially going up against Dakun.

408
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:26,540
It'll happen sooner or later.

409
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,770
What can we do?

410
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,500
Besides, if we don't admit defeat,

411
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,830
if Mr. Ou gets word of this,

412
00:20:33,230 --> 00:20:34,680
aren't the consequences worse?

413
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,700
For my godfather's sake.

414
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:39,260
If it weren't for my godfather,

415
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:43,220
I would've killed Dakun long ago.

416
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,990
Don't worry. I have an idea.

-What did you do?
-How dare you?

430
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,720
I told you not to drink so much.

431

Why did you drink so much?

-She's drunk.
-So?

Don't take it to heart.

Okay. How about this?

00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,480
I apologize on her behalf.

I think they are after Jimmy.

442

Plainclothes police on both sides.

What does it have to do with us?

519
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:07,640
How I wish the police

520
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:08,920
could have caught him earlier.

521
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,460
Yes, caught him earlier.

522
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:11,430
My goodness.

523
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,270
Did you forget your promise?

524
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,420
You said you'll tell me

525
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,700
what my godfather told you.

526
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,240
You arrogant fool.

527
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:24,580
Gosh. Saying I'm arrogant, you...

528
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,370
Your godfather wants us

529
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,130
to become his pawns.

530
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,200
Within the Four Vajras,

531
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,560
mix it up.

532
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,010
Both of us.

533
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,390
Mix up the Four Vajras?

534
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:39,240
Apart from us, who else?

535
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,910
No, I meant

536
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:42,620
The Four Vajras follow Godfather

537
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:43,770
for over a decade.

538
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,480
What's the purpose of doing so?

539
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,250
Although Mr. Ou

540
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,570
fought hard for the group,

541
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,200
The Four Vajras

542
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,480
are the ones with power.

543
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:54,020
Like you told me before,

544
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:56,570
isn't Dakun in charge of sales?

545
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,330
Congtou is in charge

546
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,560
of the ingredients.

547
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,450
Tieguanyin owns the factory.

548
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,480
Glasses is always following Mr. Ou.

549
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,990
In this kind of situation,

550
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,100
if you were Mr. Ou,

551
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,420
aren't you worried?

552
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:11,050
It's not that serious.

553
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,110
Aren't you overthinking it?

554
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,970
This puddle is deep.

555
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,600
You're too shallow-minded.

556
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,050
Is that so?

557
00:29:21,690 --> 00:29:23,060
In that case,

558
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,330
did we become the whipping boys?

559
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,870
That's what happened.

560
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:32,210
The grown-up world is so complicated.

561
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,440
Hear me out.

562
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,720
Aren't you the strategist?

563
00:29:34,810 --> 00:29:35,820
You're the thinker.

564
00:29:35,910 --> 00:29:37,050
Come up with a plan.

565
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:38,020
Come to a conclusion.

566
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,210
Just let me know.

567
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,480
I'm a little sleepy.

568
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:43,080
-I need to rest.
-Wait, you...

569
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,180
Good night.

Liu Yuanwen!

577
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:44,850
Why did he stop moving?

578
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,140
-Yes, he's been staring at it.
-Exactly.

More than two years.

Why didn't you tell me earlier?

586

It wasn't the time yet.

587

659
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,909

664
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:49,830
I want to see someone from the embassy!

00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,460
When you sell drugs,

why didn't you go to the embassy?

667
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,370
In China,

668
00:34:54,449 --> 00:34:56,080
the laws are strictly observed.

669
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,150
We have principles.

670
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,480
We don't bully the weak
and fear the strong.

671
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,710
Frankly speaking,

672
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,780
I don't care which country you're from.

673
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:05,540
If you do something like this,

674
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,740
do you think
the people from your embassy will come?

675
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,150
They won't.

676
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,390
Because they're ashamed of you.

677
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,030
From your accent,

678
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,750
I don't think you're Spanish.

679
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:22,040
You can speak Spanish.

680
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,570
So you can speak Mandarin.

681
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,610
Stop acting like you don't understand.

682
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,720
Do you need simultaneous interpretation?

683

684
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,860

685
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,620
Where did the drugs come from?

686
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:39,770
Where did the drugs come from?

687
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,070
Where did the drugs come from?

688
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,010
Let me ask you one last time.

689
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,250
Where did the drugs come from?

690
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,930
I got them from Xiaofoye.

691
00:35:59,310 --> 00:36:00,800
You're good at languages.

692
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,110
Director Liu.

693
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,130
Why did Rong Yao show up

694
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,760
to arrest Jimmy?

695
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,050
You should've told me in advance.

696
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,190
I could've prepared myself.

697
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,740
It's my test for both of you.

698
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:22,060
Fortunately, you two work well together.

699
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:28,170

700
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,340
Yuanwen.

701
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,270
Rong Yao is like you,

702
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,120
an experienced police officer.

703
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,760
So during this operation,

704
00:36:37,850 --> 00:36:39,210
I didn't inform you.

705
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,410
You guys did a great job.

706

I'm satisfied.

707
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,650
Director Liu, you're too much.

708
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,980
Next time, you should tell me in advance.

709
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,160
You old geezer.

710
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,270
From Jimmy's overnight interrogation,

711
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,070
the line "Xiaofoye" has surfaced.

712
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,300
This is a great chance to get

713
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:02,670
some insight into Group K.

714
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,710
I've already prepared your office space.

You can start anytime.

716
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,630
And I decided

717
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,820
to transfer everyone

718
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,140
from Bao Yunhai's team to you.

719
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,030
They have drug task experience.

720
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,000
At the same time,

721
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:18,020
they know Group K's modus operandi.

722
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:19,960
Mr. Liu, I beg you.

723
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:21,060
Excluding Bao Yunhai,

724
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,380
I'll pick the others myself

725
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,840
to form a task force
for a better chance of solving this case.

726
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,570
Have you decided on who to pick?

727
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,930
I have a rough idea.

728
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,430
In the last two days,

729
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:32,410
I screened
all the police officers' resumes.

730

00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:06,490
♫ This beautiful encounter ♫

855
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:09,170
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

856
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:13,790
♫ Say goodbye ♫

857
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:27,300
♫ The wind blows past you
as you zone out ♫

858
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:30,860
♫ Suddenly, I realized ♫

859
00:43:30,950 --> 00:43:34,160
♫ What we experience is love ♫

860
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:37,820
♫ And time is my love confession ♫

861
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:41,250
♫ If love ever comes ♫

862
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:44,770
♫ It's the sweetest thing
I look forward to ♫

863
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:48,020
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

864
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:51,410
♫ Say goodbye ♫

865
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:56,740
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

866
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:01,400
♫ Say goodbye ♫
