Glasses.

00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,140
-Sir.
-Go to the study.

5
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,920
Ruosheng, go home.

6
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,310
Mr. Glasses is just your subordinate.

7
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,420
Without your permission,

8
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,490
he wouldn't dare to go that far.

9
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,910
These were all your instructions.

10
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,920
Am I right?

11
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,760
Listen to me.

12
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,960
You're still suspecting Mu Qing.

13
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:07,990
Aren't you?

14
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,350
Are you still suspecting him?

15
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,730
Yes, I'm still suspecting Mu Qing.

16
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,220
So many things have happened.

17
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,500
I have reasons to suspect him.

18
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,930
I've said it many times, this is business.

19
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,480
If you make one wrong move,
you'll lose your life.

20
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,730
Do you want that to happen to me?

21
00:02:23,829 --> 00:02:25,060
What you need to do now

22
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,610
is not to question me or irritate me.

23
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,170
I'll just ask you one thing.

24
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,850
Did Mu Qing go to the hospital with you?

25
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,010
I told you he was with me.

26
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:41,560
I get that you don't trust him,
but you don't even trust me now!

27
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,020
I can't trust anyone right now.

28
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:12,710
Mu Qing is very lucky.

29
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,380
It will be okay.

30
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,060
I have sent all of my men.

31
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,300
We will find him.

32
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,400
Don't worry.

33
00:03:23,090 --> 00:03:24,760
What are the odds?

34
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,520
You're so unlucky.

35
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:29,520
Why were you at the hospital back then?

36
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,970
You even ran into Glasses.

37
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,560
Godfather gets suspicious easily.

38
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,540
Now, it's complicated.

39
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,200
If you can shut up,

40
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,660
I'll be fine with that.

41
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:45,220
Why are so mean to me?

42
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:48,000
If you didn't call Mu Qing
to the hot spring,

43
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,270
this wouldn't have happened.

44
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:53,630
Mu Qing is my best friend.

45
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,780
I would never harm him.

46
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,290
He's missing
and we don't know if he's alive.

47
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,490
I don't feel any better than you.

48
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,180
I just want him to be alive.

49
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,830
That's what happened today.

50
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,380
Sir, please let me explain.

51
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,970
What is there to explain?

52
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,870
Hurry and find Mu Qing!

53
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:42,200
Yes, sir.

♫ Give me the sadness of being lonely ♫

169
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:54,550
♫ If your gaze gives me ♫

170
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,800
♫ A sense of direction ♫

171
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,880
♫ I'll give you an answer too ♫

172

♫ Even after the stars have changed ♫

173
00:10:05,990 --> 00:10:10,170
♫ I hope you'll still recognize me
among the stars ♫

174
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,850
♫ At the place farthest away ♫

175
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,200
♫ I want to wander around with you ♫

176
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,660
♫ Going against the wind, I fly with you ♫

177
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,920
♫ To embrace the starlight ♫

178
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,910
♫ Standing on your spot ♫

♫ Only then will I forget
the faraway place ♫

00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,620
♫ Only your gaze ♫

181
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:36,920
♫ Can give me acknowledgment ♫

182
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:43,080
♫ Can give me an answer ♫

183
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:51,740
[Doctor Wang.]

184
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,720
We drew so much blood. You need to rest.

185
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,110
Doctor Wang.

186
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,090
I didn't expect to see you again.

187
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,290
Me too.

188
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,150
Three years ago,

189
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,180
I did your surgery.

190
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:07,670
Back then,

191
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,430
you had to go to France immediately.

192
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,190
I didn't have enough time.

193
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,540
I was so worried that your skin might rot

194
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,770
and ruin your treatment.

195
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,620
But now, it seems like

196
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,340
I shouldn't have been worried.

197
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,160
That's because you have amazing skills.

198
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,420
Doctor Wang.

199
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,840
I know that this is a secret.

200
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,600
I won't tell anyone.

201
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,000
Thank you.

202
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:52,950
What are you doing up?

203
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:54,790
Go back to bed.

204
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,080
I'm fine now.

205
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,970
You're not fine. You're badly injured.

206
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,130
Go back to bed. Hurry.

207
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:03,150
Here.

208
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,030
You haven't found him?

209
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,630
Yes.

210
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,050
You had over 30 people.

211
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,390
You searched all night
and couldn't find him?

212
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,880
Yungang is too huge.

213
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:29,600
He could be anywhere.

214
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,490
Besides,

215
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,000
30 people weren't even enough.

216
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:36,900
You're useless.

217
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:41,920
Come here.

218
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,520
You're all useless.

219
00:12:46,050 --> 00:12:46,980
Mr. Glasses.

220
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,740
Although Mu Qing escaped,

221
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,920
Li Ruosheng is still here.

222
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,990
Don't worry.

223
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,180
If you give orders,

224
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,600
we will definitely get them for you.

225
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,710
Yes, not just Li Ruosheng,

226
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,300
even if Mu Qing is locked up,

227
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:01,010
we'll still give him a rough time.

228
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,510
You don't know a thing!

229
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,290
Mr. Glasses.

230
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,790
What a coincidence. You're here too.

231
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,480
Mr. Glasses.

232
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:13,070
Sit down and enjoy.

233
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,430
[How did the police know]

234
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,490
[where Xiaoyue was?]

235
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,420
Congtou happens to be missing too.

236
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:18,390
Come with me.

237
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:27,900
Mr. Glasses.

238
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,290
What are you looking for?

239
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,230
Mr. Glasses.

240
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,220
What are you looking for?

241
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:45,710
Mr. Glasses.

242
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:50,860
Mr. Glasses.

243
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,400
What exactly are you looking for?

244
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,490
Am I mistaken?

245
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,360
Mr. Glasses.

246
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,870
Should I take a few men
to keep an eye on Ou Kexin?

247
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,670
Given their relationship,

248
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,470
if Mu Qing comes back,

249
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,100
he will surely go to her first.

250
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,480
Do you think Mu Qing
will dare to come back?

251
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,180
Here, drink this.

252
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,510
You made this?

253
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,970
It's good for your health.

254
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,400
I added brown sugar and dates.

255
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,120
What about this?

256
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,320
Pork liver.

257
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,100
You put liver in here?

258
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,820
That's why it smells.

259
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,370
This is why it's good for you.

260
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:53,740
Stop talking. Drink up.

261
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:04,910
Is it okay?

262
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,200
It's all right.

263
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,420
Is Doctor Wang related to the bureau?

264
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,840
How did you think of calling him?

265
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,280
Doctor Wang is Director Liu's friend.

266
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,640
All this time,

267
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,620
he has been secretly treating my wounds.

268
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:25,990
He's one of us.

269
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,220
Do you come here often?

270
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,050
When we're doing undercover work,

271
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:37,510
sometimes, in order to make it look real,

272
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,580
getting into fights is inevitable.

273
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,310
Getting hurt all the time is normal.

274
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:45,740
Fortunately, I'm always lucky enough

275
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:46,890
to make it out alive.

276
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,470
I was never seriously injured.

277
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,750
I have something to tell you.

278
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,370
Why are you so serious all of a sudden?

279
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:02,110
Group K is being torn apart.

280
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,780
Glasses is the only one left.

281
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,590
Leave him to me.

282
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,390
Just focus on healing.

283
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,730
I've been doing this for so long.

284
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,710
Glasses is the only Four Vajras left.

285
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,330
Everyone else is gone.

286
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,620
You want me to stop right now?

287
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:21,210
No way.

288
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,270
Your situation with the group

289
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,330
makes things dangerous.

290
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,430
Now, it's not only Mr. Ou,

291
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,880
but Glasses is also suspecting you.

292
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,080
You shouldn't go back now.

293
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,630
Whose idea is this?

294
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,830
It's my idea.

295
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,140
You work for
the Provincial Public Security Bureau,

296
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:43,030
but the orders we got

297
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,740
only told us to work together.

298
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:47,340
I wasn't asked to follow your orders.

299
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,940
Unless I'm given an order to stop,

300
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:51,960
no matter what happens,

301
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,410
I'll finish my mission

302
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,730
and stay undercover.

303
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,270
No one can stop me.

304
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,810
Your cover is blown.

305
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:59,570
How can you go back in?

306
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,240
I can fix this.

307
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,810
I want to see Rong Yao.

308
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,319
I need to tell him something in person.

309
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,760
Okay.

310
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,010
Thank Doctor Wang for me.

311
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:21,480
I'll make an arrangement.

312
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,069
Thank you.

313
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,440
How is it? Are they okay?

314
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,180
Yuanwen made it.

315
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,090
Thank goodness.

316
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:33,490
Rong Yu said

317
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:36,050
Yuanwen wouldn't give up on the mission.

318
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:40,450
He has his own plans.

319
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,220
He requested to see you.

320
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,730
I'll go see him even if he didn't ask.

321
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:47,880
I'll get going, Director Liu.

322
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,940
[I'm thankful to you and Director Liu.]

323
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,050
[But I have to go back to the group now.]

324
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,590
[I need to do my undercover mission.]

325
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,050
You're being suspected now.

326
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,070
No matter what,

327
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,430
I can't let you go back there.

328
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:10,590
Don't worry about that.

329
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:12,350
-I have a plan.
-Yuanwen.

330
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,510
Your mission is complete.

331
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,180
With only Glasses left,

332
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,720
he won't be able to do much.

333
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,880
You have to listen to me this time.

334
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,210
I understand what you're saying.

335
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,970
But you're asking Skylark

336
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,120
to do this mission alone.

342

But this time,

343
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,130
I didn't expect him to do this.

344

I need to finish the surgery

[The road ahead will be more dangerous.]

509
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,130
[But I'm certain]

510
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,110
[that I can handle this alone.]

511
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,110
[Please don't worry.]

512
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,350
[Have faith in the bureau.]

513
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,250
[I believe]

514
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,660
[that the dawn of victory]

515
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,760
[will soon shine on us.]

516
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,530
[I'll also do my best to protect myself]

517
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:18,880
[and share the glory of success with you]

518
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,660
[We chose our beginnings in silence.]

519
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:24,600
[But we return proudly.]

520
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:27,900
[A person chose the dawn at night.]

521
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,370
[The dawn picked him to be a free breeze.]

522
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,500
[Take care.]

523
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:38,850
[Skylark.]

524
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:43,520
[Skylark is your superior.]

525
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,940
She can decide whether you'll stay.

526
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,140
Yuanwen, it's over.

527
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,720
You should go.

528
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:50,820
No way.

529
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:52,930
You're asking her to go in alone.

530
00:29:53,590 --> 00:29:56,580
Aside from her cover as Mr. Ou's daughter,

531
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,900
she has no other advantages.

532
00:29:57,990 --> 00:29:58,920
Do you understand?

533
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:00,810
In this situation,

534
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:02,260
she's doing this on her own.

535
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,400
No way!

536
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:04,500
Liu Yuanwen, I'll repeat.

537
00:30:04,590 --> 00:30:06,350
This is an order from the higher-ups.

538
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:08,200
I don't want to hear any of this.

539
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,400
I want to see Director Wang right now!

540
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,160
Hello?

541
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,390
Hello, Director Wang.

542
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,020
It's Yuanwen.

543
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,220
Yuanwen, what is it?

544
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,200
Director Wang.

545
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,140
I really can't leave at a time like this.

546
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:31,650
Please talk to Director Liu.

547
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,250
Let me continue my undercover mission.

548
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,880
[What's the reason?]

549
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,620
I want to catch Spectre myself.

550
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:41,420
That's not your mission.

551
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,050
It's Skylark's.

552
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,460
[Besides,]

553
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,620
[your cover is basically exposed.]

554
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,160
If you go back,

555
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,140
it's going to cause a lot of trouble.

556
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,300
Director Wang, don't worry.

557
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,150
I have confidence and a plan.

558
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,600
I can fix everything.

559
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,360
I just need you to agree.

560
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,740
Hello, Director Wang. I'm Rong Yao.

561
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,650
Yuanwen just told me what he had in mind.

562
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:14,370
I think he has a point.

563
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,710
Skylark is in the group alone.

564
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,070
It's hard to work.

565
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,710
[Although her cover might keep her safe,]

566
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:22,560
I'm still worried.

567
00:31:23,130 --> 00:31:24,800
Rong Yao, does that mean

568
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,610
you agree with him?

569
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,150
But of course in the end,

570
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,510
it's for the bureau to decide.

571
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,050
[Put Yuanwen on the phone.]

572
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:36,370
Okay.

573
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:40,770
Director Wang.

574
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:41,740
Yuanwen.

575
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,120
Director Liu is doing this

576
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,270
to protect you.

577
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:47,770
Also,

578
00:31:48,470 --> 00:31:49,620
you ignored Director Liu

579
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,640
and called me directly.

580
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,970
It's a violation of discipline.

581
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:55,780
Yes.

582
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,010
I will reflect on it.

583
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,770
[You really should.]

584
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,320
[Since Rong Yao agrees with you,]

585
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:05,590
I'll talk to Director Liu about this.

586
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,050
Thank you, Director Wang.

587
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,910
Don't be too happy yet.

588
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,190
In the end,

589
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:14,870
if he doesn't allow you to go back,

590
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:17,380
you have to obey his order.

591
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:19,180
This is not negotiable.

592
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,310
Yes. I understand.

593
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,120
[Send all your ideas and plans to me.]

594
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,580
Wait for the news.

595
00:32:27,590 --> 00:32:29,520
Director Liu can't find out

596
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:31,420
that you contacted me directly.

597
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,090
Yes, Director Wang.

598
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,590
You won't be so lucky every time.

599
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:44,350
Be careful.

600
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:45,800
Don't worry.

601
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,860
Sir, what are your orders?

602
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,030
[What orders, my friend?]

603
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,610
[There's something]

604
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,850
[I want to discuss with you.]

605
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:00,010
Wait.

606
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:01,990
Don't tell me.

607
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:04,590
Is it about Yuanwen?

608
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,580
I guessed it right.

609
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:13,430
Does Yuanwen want to go back to Group K?

610
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,840
He couldn't convince me,

611
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,990
so he went to you?

612
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:19,810
Do you think Yuanwen would do that?

613
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:21,930
You trained him.

614
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:24,700
Would he do something

615
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:26,370
that is against the rules?

616
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,170
I don't think he would do it.

617
00:33:28,570 --> 00:33:29,540
Director Wang.

618
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:32,440
I put Yuanwen undercover.

619
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:34,110
He's in danger.

620
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:35,870
It's right to bring him back.

621
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,150
I followed the protocol.

622
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,780
It's simple.

623
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,190
I hope Yuanwen

624
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,210
can go back and help Rong Yu.

625
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,630
[On one hand,]

626
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,620
[Rong Yu needs someone to help her.]

627
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,400
[Yuanwen is the best candidate.]

628
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:52,940
[We all know]

629
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:54,750
[about their relationship.]

630
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:56,950
[So...]

631
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,540
[I think you transferred Yuanwen]

632
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,570
[because you had no choice.]

633
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,210
I'll send you an operation plan soon

634
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:07,600
to help Yuanwen get back to Group K.

635
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,150
I'll send it to you in ten minutes.

636
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,780
[After you read it,]

637
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,840
[you can make your decision.]

638
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,949
Although Yuanwen doesn't know

639
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,460
that Skylark is Rong Yu yet,

640
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:25,590
after what they had been through,

641
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:27,310
the two of them

642
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:29,989
were able to work together

643
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,150
to finish such a difficult mission.

644
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,830
This whole thing

645
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:38,260
is a blessing itself to Yuanwen.

646
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,679
Director Wang.

647
00:34:44,909 --> 00:34:46,800
We'll have to keep it a secret.

648
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,870
I know that.

649
00:34:49,830 --> 00:34:50,889
It's very brutal.

650
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:53,440
But to complete the mission,

651
00:34:54,409 --> 00:34:55,330
this is a sacrifice

652
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,270
[that we have to make.]

653
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:20,680
[Hello?]

654
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:23,100
[Mr. Ou, it's me.]

655
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:26,130
I'm going to Yungang next month.

656
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,600
You're finally coming.

657
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,840
You're welcome here.

658
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,290
When will you arrive?

659
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,010
You pick the date.

660
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,030
I want security.

661
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,230
I'm sure you know what I mean.

662
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,120
Of course.

663
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:58,210
Ruosheng, come over.

664
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,020
And bring Kexin with you.

665
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,960
There are two things.

666
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,680
Number one.

667
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,440
Ruosheng.

668
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,170
I want you to be my number two.

669
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,310
From now on,

670
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,250
you'll work with Glasses.

671
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,860
I'll work with Mr. Glasses?

672
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,350
Why?

673
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,240
Just say yes or no.

674
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:24,430
Godfather, I...

675
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,620
I don't like it.

676
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,030
He'll do it.

677
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,350
I didn't say I would do it.

678
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:29,710
It's a good thing.

679
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,250
You should thank my dad.

680
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,700
What if Mu Qing comes back?

681
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,590
Whether Mu Qing returns or not,

682
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,130
I have a new plan.

683
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,450
Wait, Godfather.

684
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,830
Mu Qing managed most of our business.

685
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,150
If he's not here,

686
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:43,040
I don't know enough to do it.

687
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,370
I'm here too.

688
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:46,610
Stop it.

689
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:48,630
We're talking about business.

690
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:50,610
You're not in the group, so stop it.

691
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,890
I may not be a part of it now,

692
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,210
but I can be one day.

693
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:54,660
Dad.

694
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,420
Teach me about business

695
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,610
so I can help you out.

696
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,320
If you want to help me,

697
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,950
then promise me the second thing.

698
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:02,580
Tell me.

699
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,210
Go back to France.

700
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,670
Why do you want me to go back?

701
00:37:06,890 --> 00:37:08,030
It doesn't have to be France.

702
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:09,400
It can be any other country.

703
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,670
Don't stay in China.

704
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:11,950
Especially not in Yungang.

705
00:37:13,050 --> 00:37:15,600
Why are you asking me to go now?

706
00:37:16,090 --> 00:37:17,890
An important person is coming.

707
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:19,910
Godfather, is it Spectre?

708
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,600
Kexin.

709
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,970
It's not that I don't want you by my side.

710
00:37:25,460 --> 00:37:27,830
But I'm about to make a huge deal.

711
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,120
The group's survival depends on it.

712
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:31,750
As you know,

713
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,480
Dakun, Congtou, and Guanyin

714
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,370
were arrested one after the other.

715
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,660
The group is a mess right now.

716
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:40,990
At this moment,

717
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,020
I can't risk having you here.

718
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,820
Ruosheng.

719
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,150
Get Kexin out of the country soon.

720
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:53,000
One more thing.

721
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:55,510
Don't let Glasses find out about it.

722
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,360
Yes.

723
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:01,710
It seems Godfather
doesn't trust Glasses anymore.

724
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,960
But I didn't think

725
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,670
he would make me his second-in-command.

726
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,340
Do you really think

727
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,790
my dad thinks you're good?

728
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,350
Well...

729
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,160
Either way,

730
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,270
there's nobody else.

731
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,460
Mu Qing isn't here either.

732
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,420
You haven't heard from him yet?

733
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,400
Enough about him.

734
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,680
Li Ruosheng.

735
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,260
Do me a favor.

736
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,360
What?

737
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,170
I don't want to leave.

738
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,030
I can't help you with that.

739
00:38:43,470 --> 00:38:44,480
I've promised Godfather.

740
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:47,380
Why don't you understand?

741
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:49,230
I can help you.

742
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:51,120
All right, give me a break.

743
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,640
I'm taking you home now.

744
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:55,650
You should pack up.

745
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,150
We'll leave in two days.

746
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:07,750
What?

747
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,170
You want me to work with Li Ruosheng?

748
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,800
What?

749
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,470
You don't want to?

750
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:16,550
Of course I do.

751
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,620
If you say so,

752
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:19,940
I'll definitely do it.

753
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,540
Although Li Ruosheng and I

754
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,860
had a misunderstanding,

755
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:25,570
after all,

756
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,990
we're all part of the same group.

757
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:31,340
We need to maintain peace to make money.

758
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,420
Besides, I'm much older than him.

759
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:36,620
Bowing to a young man

760
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,380
is not that embarrassing.

761
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,490
However,

762
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,390
you're not happy about it.

763
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,220
It's in the past.

764
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,460
It has been over a decade.

765
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:50,830
I know you well enough.

766
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,200
You're very cautious,

767
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:54,880
but you're narrow-minded.

768
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,280
You're vengeful.

769
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,100
You're not afraid of anyone other than me.

770
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,430
All right.

771
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,250
Put your issue with Li Ruosheng aside.

772
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:06,580
I have something more important

773
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,550
for you to do.

774
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,880
What is it?

775
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,300
Next month,

776
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,320
Spectre is coming to Yungang.

777
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,440
Organize it well.

778
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:19,030
There must not be any mistakes.

779
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:21,850
Show Spectre what our group is capable of.

780
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,970
This is between you and me.

781
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:28,010
Don't let anyone else know.

782
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:29,990
I understand.

783
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,040
Remember.

784
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:34,610
I want everything to be safe and steady.

785
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,630
During this time,

786
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,300
you and Ruosheng need to stop fighting.

787
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,330
I don't have any problems.

788
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:42,310
But if...

789
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,330
I'm just saying "if."

790
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,530
If Li Ruosheng goes against me,

791
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,540
what should I do?

792
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,830
That would mean he's against me.

793
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:52,160
I understand.

794
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,010
You may go.

795
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:56,250
Wait.

796
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,630
Find Mu Qing as soon as possible.

797
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,530
He knows too many secrets.

798
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,340
Yes, sir.

799
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:24,980
Take care of things at the shop.

800
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:26,260
I'll be back tomorrow.

801
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,770
Shut up and just leave.

802
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,820
Don't come back.

803
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,760
-I'm going.
-Hurry up.

804
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,440
