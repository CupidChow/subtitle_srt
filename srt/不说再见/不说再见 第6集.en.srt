Isn't your card mine too?

Sir, your phone is ringing.

-Hello?
-What "hello"?

Come back quickly.

because Mr. Ou asked?

19
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,430
The boss didn't ask you to come.

20
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,040
I'm the one who invited you.

21

Is he the little brat

25
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,370
that called Mr. Ou

What do you mean?

32
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,300
Glasses, you're always by Boss's side.

33

Tell them what happened.

34
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:17,070
Boss has been saying

35
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,560
that he's retiring.

36
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,390
I'm afraid he really meant it.

-So?
-So?

But who will rule this group?

41
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,470
You're right, Dakun.

42
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,970
Dakun.

43
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,210
I...

44
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:47,160
I, Congtou, will start first.

45
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:49,140
In our group,

46
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,430
I'm in charge of transporting goods.

47
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:53,720
I do all the dirty work.

48
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,740
No money, no power, no extras.

49

-But I don't think I...
-Congtou.

50

Do you really think so?

51
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,550
No.

52
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,270
It's just an immature opinion.

53
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,540
Here's what it is.

54
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,310
Because Mr. Glasses

55
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,200
has been at Mr. Ou's side

56
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,440
for so many years.

57
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,770
It's possible

58
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:14,750
that he'll get the position.

59
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,800
Right?

60
00:04:16,899 --> 00:04:18,360
I'm not capable.

61
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,470
I'm only in charge of management.

62
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,660
The reason why

63
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,110
our group can make it this far

64
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,130
is all because of you three.

65
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,020
I'm sure Mr. Ou is aware.

66
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,260
He won't consider me

67
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,710
when he's choosing a successor.

68
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,520
Why are you all looking at me?

69
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,250
Everyone knows that I'm just a woman.

70
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,060
What are you doing?

71
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,380
In the group,

72
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,440
I'm also in the minority.

73
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,200
I only know about manufacturing

74
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,440
and development.

75
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,550
I can't do anything else

76
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,310
and I don't understand anything else.

77
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,170
Mr. Ou has already overestimated me

78
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,320
by putting me in charge of a factory.

79
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,360
I think the successor...

80
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,700
Dakun does have a chance

81
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,160
of winning the lottery.

82
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:20,400
How can I be the lucky one?

83
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,550
All you do is make fun of me.

84
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,800
Dakun.

85
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,040
In times of trouble, you should stand up.

86
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,900
Here. Let's make a toast in advance.

87
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,750

88
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,890

89
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:34,080
-Dakun.
-That's right.

90
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,090
If it isn't Dakun,

91
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,720
-I think it's unfair.
-Yes!

92
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,430
Here, Dakun.

93
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,530

94
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,430
-Cheers.
-Dakun, cheers to you.

95

You're pushing me.

96
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,230
You're supposed to be my assistant.

97
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,330
Where did you go?

98
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,530
Aren't you tired of trying on clothes?

99
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,159
So I bought you a bottle of water.

100
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,610
That's nice of you.

101
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,860
Put it inside.

102
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,050
They say shopping is a leisure activity,

103
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,500
but it's quite tiring.

104
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,440
Let's sit over there.

105
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:09,150
-My legs ache.
-Can I sit?

106
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,250
Of course.

107
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,790
I'm nice to my assistant.

108
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,930
What? Do you want to give me a massage?

109
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,830
You're overthinking it.

110
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,030
Then why are you looking at me?

111
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,530
I'm just wondering.

112
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,730
You go to the mall four times a week.

113
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,580
Aren't you sick of it?

114
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,909
I am.

115
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,450
Then why?

116
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:44,300
What else is fun?

117
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:47,950
Your source of fun

118
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,860
comes from buying things?

119
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:53,409
-Is that a problem?
-It's not exactly that.

120
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,300
I just think that

121
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,440
since Mr. Ou

122
00:06:56,530 --> 00:06:58,030
agreed to let you stay in Yungang,

123
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,570
you should do something.

124
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,330
You're always lazing around.

125
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,660
That's not fun.

126
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,990
Do you think I want this?

127
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,880
I went abroad at such a young age.

128
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,560
I don't have any friends in Yungang.

129
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,100
My dad can't be with me.

130
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,370
I'm with you every day,

131
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,740
but you're so boring.

132
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,060
What else can I do?

133
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,640
Also,

134
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,030
what do you mean by "lazing around"?

135
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,620
You think I've never thought
about doing something?

136
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,100
I'm still jet-lagged.

137
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,600
I just want to rest.

138
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,820
So, what are you doing after that?

139
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,560
I can't figure this out.

140
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:38,330
Mu Qing and Li Ruosheng.

141
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:40,220
How did they gain

142
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,159
Mr. Ou's trust?

143
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,450
VIVI is such a nice venue.

144
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,159
He gave it to no one

145
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:48,540
but the two of them.

146
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:50,480
Dakun.

147
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,940
Haven't you thought about it?

148
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,670
Is there a reason why?

149
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,260
Dakun.

150
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,170
To us, those two brats

151
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,730
are like time bombs.

152
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,240
You never know

153
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,190
when they're going to explode.

154
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,390
Of course.

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,860
Even if they explode,

156
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,180
the three of us,

157
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,500
we won't lose too much.

158
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,670
But you're different, Dakun.

159
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,230
[Dakun, Jimmy has been arrested.]

160
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,290
[What should I do?]

161
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:54,360
When I was abroad,

162
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:55,770
I studied fashion design.

163
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,490
I think...

164
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,640
If I could open

165
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,310
a personal tailor-made boutique,

166
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,500
I think it would be nice.

167
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,980
You?

168
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:08,000
Fashion design?

169
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,380
Are you looking down on me?

170
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,600
I guess your fashion sense is not too bad.

171
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,270
How surprising.

172
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,720
You complimented me.

173
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,310
That's the only one I'll give.

174
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,090
You're such a character.

175
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,570
What character?

176
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,730
Tell me.

177
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,310
You're okay. You're not bad.

178
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,890
But now that you mention it,

179
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:44,260
that reminds me.

180
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,850
Shopping all day

181
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,520
really isn't fun at all.

182
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,300
I might as well do it today.

183
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,570
Let's go.

184
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,300
Where are we going?

185
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,590
To look for a place for my store.

186
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,220
You can't be serious.

187
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,840
Do you think I need

188
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:02,820
to tell jokes to my assistant?

189
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,800
Come on.

190
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:13,690
Is it that urgent?

191
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,110
It's urgent.

192
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,360
She's so unpredictable.

193
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,070
You asked me to come.
Why aren't you talking?

194
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,210
What's happening?

195
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,710
It's a relative of yours.

196
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,130
He came looking for you.

197
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,630
He wanted to surprise you.

198
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,950
Are you kidding me?

199
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,020
I don't have any relatives here.

200
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,200
That's why

201
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,100
it's called a surprise.

202
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,420
Just tell me already.

203
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,690
Don't leave me hanging.

204
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,700
What's the hurry?

205
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,070
Just wait and see.

206
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:54,350
Uncle?

207
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,370
Why are you here?

208
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,360
Who is this man?

209
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,120
Bao Yunhai's relative.

210
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,200
What do you want me to do?

211
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,960
Surprise him.

212
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,800
[Yungang Public Security Bureau]

213
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:21,450
Do I look like him?

214
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,830
From a distance, it looks fine.

215
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,740
I can still tell up close.

216
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,800
Let me formally introduce you.

217
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,750
-This is...
-Zhanqian District's Zhao Ran.

218
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,160
Reporting for duty.

219
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:40,240
I'm doing my Master
of Criminal Psychology.

220
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,790
I'm an expert in disguising, stalking,
and anti-pickpocketing.

221
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,550
I've mastered the rules of drug dealing.

222
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:45,650
Captain Bao.

223
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,450
-Hello, Zhao Ran.
-I'm sorry.

224
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,060
Welcome to the task force.

225
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,250
Thank you, Captain Rong.

226
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:54,890
Watch your step.

227
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:58,630
Here. Look at the layout of this house.

228
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,360
You can use this empty lot up ahead

229
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:02,900
however you like.

230
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:04,610
Did you see the bookshelves?

231
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,670
There's a lot of space.

232
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,770
Feel free to use them.

233
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,180
That's right. Here.

234
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,070
I'll show you the warehouse.

235
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,800
This warehouse was just renovated.

236
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,170
The walls inside and this window

237
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,540
are also new.

238
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,680
Don't worry.

239
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,090
The quality is absolutely fine.

240
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,380
If you really decide to rent this place,

241
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:23,620
you're free to use all of these.

242
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,850
I won't move them.

243
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,610
They're all useless to me.

244
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,060
You might as well lower the price.

245
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:31,010
How much are you thinking of?

246
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,260
Ten thousand?

247
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,240
No, that's too low.

248
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,730
Our basic price is 26 thousand.

249
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,100
It's all concrete.

250
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,640
You said that it was decorated

251
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:41,790
and that it was refined?

252
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,290
You're lying.

253
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,780
No. Why would I lie to you?

254
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,620
-What are you doing?
-What kind of building is this?

255
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:52,400
Is it even safe to stay here?

256
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,120
No. How about this?

257
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,590
How about 20 thousand?

258
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,440
What, 20 thousand?

259
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,590
Why don't we keep looking?

260
00:13:01,770 --> 00:13:02,690
Bye.

261
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,800
-Come on.
-Don't go.

262
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:06,920
If you want more than ten thousand,
forget it.

263
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:12,680
All right.

264
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,620
Look at the footage here.

265
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,990
It's good.

266
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,530
Not bad.

267
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,600
I have a little surprise for you.

268
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,000
Tell me.

269
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:30,720
Take your phone out. Look at it.

270
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,690
There's nothing. It's normal.

271
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:37,800
Your password is way too long.

272
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,260
I'll make it simple.

273
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,020
Unlock it yourself.

274
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,130
What's wrong?

275
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,310
How did you do that?

276
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,370
It's a secret.

277
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,880
No wonder.

278
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,460
I won't rent it

279
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,960
even if they pay me money.

280
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:03,670
Why?

281
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:05,960
Look.

282
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:08,430
See for yourself.

283
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,690
"Building Three, Pioneer Art District.

284
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,280
Paranormal activities occurred.

285
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,920
Investigations are ongoing."

286
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,060
No wonder.

287
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,440
How could you rent such a big place
for 20 thousand?

288
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:22,550
It's haunted.

289
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:26,550
Why are you looking at me like that?

290
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,490
I was thinking

291
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:29,850
if you move in,

292
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,440
maybe there will be

293
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,890
no paranormal activities anymore.

294
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,650
Why?

295
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,690
It's because

296
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:39,580
you'll scare the ghost away.

297
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,700
That's so mean.

298
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,550
You better watch your mouth.

299
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,320
Since you've decided to move out,

300
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,430
why don't you rent a normal apartment?

301
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:59,420
That's so boring.

302
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,710
There's a kind of workshop abroad

303
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,120
with multiple stories.

304
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,660
Do you know it?

305
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,860
Like a loft?

306
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,670
Smart. No wonder my dad favors you.

307
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:17,810
Give me your hand.

308
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,760
-What's wrong?
-Give it to me.

309
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:22,170
Hurry up.

310
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:23,930
Your hand.

311
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,720
Palm reading?

312
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,920
You're good with money.

313
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,290
It's a lot better than two years ago.

314
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,540
You'll be rich soon.

315
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:40,740
Your lifeline is also long.

316
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,050
But your love life is rough.

317
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,420
You're very greedy for power.

318
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,280
I bet you're tired of Li Ruosheng.

319
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,530
Is that right?

320
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:58,910
Impressive, right?

321
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,740
Wait. The callus on your palm is so thick.

322
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,940
Do you use guns often?

323
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,980
That's a big error.

324
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,980
It's just that I cook quite often.

325
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,300
You cook?

326
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,020
Okay, I've read your palm.

327
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,880
There's nothing else to do. Let's go.

328
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,720
Where are we going?

329
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:25,440
To keep looking for a place.

330
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:26,890
I've checked the date.

331
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,490
Tomorrow is an auspicious day
for renovations.

332
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,200
So we have to find a place today.

333
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,330
-Come on.
-Did you really

334
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,050
stay in France for over ten years?

335
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,940
Reading palms, checking dates...

336
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,530
Is she an old lady?

337
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:49,950
Are you coming or not?

338
00:16:50,430 --> 00:16:51,660
Fine.

339
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,200
Don't forget to pay.

340
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,000
She read my right palm.

341
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,370
Does she know what she's doing?

342
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,780
What an amateur.

343
00:17:05,170 --> 00:17:06,359
Jimmy's gone.

344
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,310
Are you trying to hide?

345
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,800
Yes, Dakun.

346
00:17:10,890 --> 00:17:12,170
I don't want to get caught.

347
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,790
I'll do anything.

348
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:15,290
Okay.

349
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,900
I'll find someone to help you.

350
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,660
You hide first. What do you think?

351
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,589
Dakun, are you trying to...

352
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,500
If I wanted to kill you,

353
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,609
I wouldn't have waited until now.

354
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,190
Thank you, Dakun.

355
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,340
Thank you.

356
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:33,290
That's enough. Stop it.

357
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,910
There's something

358
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,330
I want you to do.

359
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,090
Do it for me.

360
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,710
Look at this.

361
00:17:57,790 --> 00:17:59,020
This is such a nice place.

362
00:17:59,290 --> 00:18:00,830
They wouldn't let us use it.

363
00:18:01,270 --> 00:18:02,500
But when they're here,

364
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,480
they can have it all.

365
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,150
The director is so unfair.

366
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,160
I see.

367
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,190
Maybe it's because I'm in this.

368
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:12,360
You punk. Aren't you embarrassed?

369
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:14,030
It's no fun.

370
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,750
Mr. Bao, who is this guy?

371
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,120
-Who?
-This one

372
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:23,440
in the photo with you.

373
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:26,660
This was my first arrest.

374
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,550
A criminal?

375
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,130
Why did you take this picture?

376
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,820
Don't you hackers do the same thing?

377
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,880
After attacking a website,

378
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,780
you'll leave your name behind, right?

379
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,020
I don't leave my name

380
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,250
when I'm doing good deeds.

381
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,700
Hello.

382
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:43,820
-Captain Bao.
-Mr. Zhao.

383
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,190
Hello, Zheng Ke.

384
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,170
Hello.

385
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,060
You two talk. I'll check around.

386
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,340
From now on,

387
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:52,440
we're partners.

388
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:53,890
-Nice to meet you.
-It's a pleasure.

389
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,790
Zheng Ke.

390
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,860
Do you have a daughter?

391
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,440
And she's sick?

392
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,120
How do you know?

393
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,060
Your charm.

394
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:12,280
Looking at it,
it's clearly a gift from a girl.

395
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:14,260
And she's no more than ten years old.

396
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,820
When I shook your hand earlier,

397
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:19,020
you smelled of hospital disinfectants.

398
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:22,970
It's faint, but my nose works well.

399
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,490
I know an old traditional medicine doctor.

400
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,080
Bring the kid there someday.

401
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,750
You're really something.

402
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,170
Mr. Zhao is just like you.

403
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,670
You guys are no ordinary people.

404
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,990
Let's work well together.

405
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:38,020
[Yungang Public Security Bureau]

406
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,980
Do you already have a name?

407
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:44,530
What's the name of the team?

408
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,440
What about “Leopard Hunters”?

409
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,370
No.

410
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,220
Enough with the tigers and leopards.

411
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:53,160
You think too highly of the drug dealers.

412
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,650
They're rats from the street.

413
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,060
They deserve to be punished.

414
00:19:56,150 --> 00:19:57,380
The Rat Hunters then?

415
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,680
-I...
-Captain Rong.

416
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:02,880
Where did you find him, Captain Rong?

417
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,030
How is he on the team?

418
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,210
What did you say?

419
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:07,060
Don't fight.

420
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,470
I have an idea.

421
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:10,450
Team Bashi.

422
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:12,080
"Bashi"?

423
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,400
It's in the Sichuan dialect.

424
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,730
It means nice and comfortable.

425
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,270
Should we turn on the AC

426
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,680
and have a hot pot too?

427
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,350
Hold on.

428
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,870
That gave me an idea.

429
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:26,290
Why don't we name ourselves Task Force 84?

430
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,310
Isn't "84" a kind of disinfectant?

431
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,380
-It is.
-That's right.

432
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,980
We should be like the disinfectant.

433
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,650
We'll cleanse Yungang City.

434
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:37,110
Disinfectant. It's a great expression.

435
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,620
Just like how Lin Zexu
destroyed opium pipes,

436
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:41,730
our Task Force 84 will save Yungang.

437
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,750
Director Liu, it's settled.

438
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:47,980
It's good.

439
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:50,660
Okay, we are "Task Force 84."

440
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,790
Yes, all of them. Bring them down.

441
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:59,380
Keep them coming.

442
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:03,030
All this hard labor.

443
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,700
Why didn't you just call for some goons?

444
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,590
Why did you have to do it yourself?

445
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,220
I'm being considerate.

446
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,640
It's a great workout for you guys.

447
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,510
There's no need. We're in good shape.

448
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,970
That's not it.

449
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,180
Those people aren't reliable.

450
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,730
You two look more trustworthy.

451
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,270
That's why I want you to do it.

452
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,220
That's more like it.

453
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:33,480
-Help me.
-Use your strength!

454
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,680
No way, Li Ruosheng.

455
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,920
Didn't you just say

456
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:39,460
that you are in good shape?

457
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,320
Can you do it?

458
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,780
Hurry up. These are heavy too.

459
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,320
Come on. There's more.

460
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,610
Move it. Hurry up.

461
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:52,220
Keep going.

462
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,110
Keep going.

463
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:56,580
You're slacking off again!

464
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,690
Hurry up.

465
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,840
Move it there.

466
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,780
-Come on.
-You should've told me.

467
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:03,970
I'll change clothes.

468
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,160
Look at me now.

469
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,450
Wearing a shirt looks better.

470
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,650
Look at you.

471
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,780
The suspect's nickname is Xiaofoye.

472
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,590
The purity of the drugs
recovered from Jimmy

473
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,150
and the residue in the drugs have shown

474
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,990
that this batch from Xiaofoye

475
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,890
is industrially mass-produced,

476
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:24,430
not a small drug lab.

477
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:25,880
In other words,

478
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:27,460
it's almost certain

479
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,870
that his drugs came from Group K.

480
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:30,500
You mean the Group K

481
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,350
that's hiding in Yungang City?

482
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:33,580
That's right.

483
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,750
If Xiaofoye is close with Group K,

484
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,810
when we capture this suspect,

485
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,010
maybe we'll get a breakthrough.

486
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:43,080
But first things first.

487
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,020
Let's find out

488
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,530
who Xiaofoye is.

489
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,390
Let's split up.

490
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,010
It's time to show our talents.

491
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,510
-Let's go.
-Okay.

492
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,230
-All right.
-Rong Yao!

493
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:00,950
Why did you ignore me

494
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,400
when you were assembling the team?

495
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,890
How am I inferior to others?

496
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:05,210
Tell me why.

497
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,590
It's nothing personal.

498
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,590
We're going on a mission now.

499
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:15,770
I'm going too.

500
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:20,920
Leave your feelings out of this.

501
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:21,980
This is work.

502
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,030
Okay?

503
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:24,970
Then you need to tell me right now.

504
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,520
Why can't I join the task force?

505
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,890
I don't see what you can do

506
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,380
for this team yet.

507
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:32,230
-What do you mean?
-Yimeng.

508
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,940
Let's talk about that later.

509
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:35,310
We're going on a mission.

510
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,550
Say whatever you want after work, okay?

511
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,530
Rong Yao.

512
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,730
You owe me a reasonable explanation.

513
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,760
You violated the rules.

514
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,780
I'll say the same
even if the director's here.

515
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,060
How about this?

516
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,510
I challenge you.

517
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,060
If you win, I'll respect your decision.

518
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:53,960
If you lose, I'll join Task Force 84.

519
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,160
Li Yimeng.

520
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,880
Do you think this is a game?

521
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,460
I'm always serious at work.

522
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,680
It stinks in here.

523
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,220
Thank you.

524
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,380
I got you some water.

525
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,330
This is yours, Mu Qing.

526
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,700
Li Ruosheng.

527
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,420
Li Ruosheng!

528
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:23,220
What are you doing? Slacking off?

529
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:24,410
It's too hot.

530
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,080
Let me stay with this fan for a while.

531
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,320
I have to spin it myself.

532
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,080
I was so kind to bring you water.

533
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,140
Thank you.

534
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:37,350
-Did you just trick me?
-You were slacking off.

535
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,930
You tricked me, you evil boss.

536
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,250
I've been working for you.

537
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:42,100
You won't even give me a sip of water.

538
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,920
Look at how dirty my shoes are.

539
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,380
Does it even come off?

540
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,370
My mysophobia...

541
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,780
I can't take it anymore.

542
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,410
If you continue to bully me,

543
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:54,900
I won't do it anymore.

544
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,320
Let Mu Qing do it all for you.

545
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:04,580
I'm sorry.

546
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,310
It slipped. It was an accident.

547
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,380
You did that on purpose, right?

548
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:10,870
Let me get some on you!

549
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,550
-Look up there.
-Was it intentional?

550
00:25:12,630 --> 00:25:15,100
-Do it.
-There you go.

551
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,390
I'm a mysophobe. Don't you know?

552
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:18,710
-Go!
-I'm all dirty now.

553
00:25:18,790 --> 00:25:20,330
-Don't come closer.
-Work harder.

554
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:22,140
Keep painting, would you?

[Strict requirements]

I'm still standing.

She would've lost if Rong Yao was trying.

565

What do you know?

566
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,220
It's about proving a point.

567
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,200
Women hate being looked down on

568
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,600
by a bunch of men like you.

569
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,020
You lost.

570
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,140
Yes, I lost.

571
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,750
Does this still count

572
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,070
towards joining the team?

573
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,450
Get ready.

574

It smells so good. Here.

577
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:49,010
I'll pass.

578
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,030
I'll eat it then.

579
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:53,450
You said you'd buy me a meal.

580
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:54,810
Is this it?

581
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:56,930
It's divine.

582
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,330
When I was in Europe,

583
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,530
I had pizzas and burgers every day.

584
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,340
I can't even eat dumplings.

585
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,360
You have no idea how lucky you are.

586
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,630
I think I'm done helping you.

587
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,920
-Can I go now?
-No.

588
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,560
You can't leave whenever you want.

589
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,580
You can only go if I let you go.

590
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,770
Understand, Mu Qing?

591
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,410
Since you're my bodyguard,

592
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,990
it's weird to call your name.

593
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,270
What should I call you?

594
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,070
I'll call you Qingqing.

595
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,830
Okay, Qingqing?

596
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:27,680
"Qingqing"?

597
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:30,590
-No. But you...
-Barbecued pork!

598
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,260
I want three of these, ma'am.

599
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,330
-Okay.
-Pay the money.

600
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,120
I'm having one first.

601
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:41,410
It's hot!

602
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,930
It looks delicious.

603
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,800
I think this place just opened.
I want to try it.

604
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,270
Why do you always want
to try new restaurants?

605
00:28:51,350 --> 00:28:52,540
We just ate.

606
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,040
I want to try it.

607
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,460
Look at your cheeks.

608
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,000
-It's getting chubby.
-Forget it.

609
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:00,070
Let's eat.

610
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,310
I like you just the way you are.
Let's eat.

611
00:29:03,630 --> 00:29:04,510
It's hot.

612
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,120
What are you doing? I said, pay up.

613
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,900
The way you looked at me...

614
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:18,280
Are you into me?

615
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,150
What do you mean? You're overthinking it.

616
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,650

620
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:31,740
I'll get going.

621
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,880
You're my bodyguard.

622
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,650
-Just this once.
-I didn't tell you to leave.

623
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,810
What kind of attitude is that?

624
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,230
Hey!

00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:54,890

00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:01,840
Not exactly.

629
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,910
Just a friendly reminder.

630
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:08,130
I heard there's a wind blowing this way.

631
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,770
Is it a typhoon or a breeze?

632
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:11,920
It's up to you.

633

I can't stop you.

638
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,770
But be careful with your successor.

00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,450
A breeze can be fine,

640
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,080

00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,390
That's fake.

It's nice here, right?

My dad.

He found out about my store.

He still has a conscience.

653

Look. Actually, he treats you quite well.

655

656

It's for you.

657
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,310
See if you like it.

658
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,720
For me?

659
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:37,230
Thank you.

660

Kexin, is that for me?

661
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,390
That?

662
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,490
That's flawed.

663
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,770
I was going to throw it away.

664
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:46,870
But that's fine.

665
00:31:46,950 --> 00:31:48,540
No one's wearing it anyway. Here.

666
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,480
It's flawed?

667
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:53,900
It's okay. It's totally fine.

668
00:31:53,990 --> 00:31:55,490
Isn't it a pity to throw it away?

669
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,000
I was joking. I made it for you.

670
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,150
Thank you, Ms. Ou.

671

00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,690
look good together, right?

682
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,810
But the fabric you chose

683
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,400
for this tie is too soft.

684
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:59,080
-It won't even form a knot.
-It doesn't work like that.

685
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:00,400
You fool.

686
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:04,630
Like this and then this way.

687
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,560
See?

688
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:07,880
That's how it works.

689
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:09,199
Thank you, Ms. Designer.

690
00:34:09,770 --> 00:34:10,960
-Of course.
-Do I look good?

691
00:34:11,929 --> 00:34:13,730
The outfit looks great,

692
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:16,370
-but the person...
-Is still lacking?

693
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,870
You're getting better.

694
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,250
Mu Qing.

695
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,480
He's in the bathroom.

696
00:34:21,739 --> 00:34:23,060
Maybe he fell into the toilet.

697
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,250
He's been gone for so long.

698
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,540
How about this?

699
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,860
You can find some tools

700
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,050
to dig him out.

701
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:39,780
Fine, I'll ride the horse there.

702
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,820
Are you sure?

703
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:45,190
It's the men's room.

704
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,430
[The phone has been turned off.]

705
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:07,460
[Please try again later.]

706
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,510
[I'm sorry.]

707
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,210
[The phone has been turned off.]

708
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,410
-How is it? Is he in there?
[-Please try again later.]

709
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:15,640
Did he pick up?

710
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,400
His phone is off.

711
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:20,520
Let's look for him.

712
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,820
-What's wrong?
-I'm fine. I just slipped.

713
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,630
Kexin.

714
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,420
What's wrong?

715
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:36,500
What is this?

716
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,050
-That's not good.
-What's wrong?

717
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,790
What are you doing?

718
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,700
Listen.

719
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,150
Find out quickly

720
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,820
where Laoba the Butcher is.

721
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,450
Send it to my phone.

722
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,870
Who is that?

723
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,540
He is a professional assassin.

724
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:00,740
He uses a strong anesthetic

725
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,060
to put his target to sleep,

726
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,820
before taking him back to his lair.

727
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:07,560
Are you saying that Mu Qing was captured?

728
00:36:09,230 --> 00:36:10,460
I hope not.

729
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:16,310
Where are we going?

730
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,000
Get to the point.

731
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,210
In Hengshun Road in the east,

732
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,620
there's a slaughterhouse.

733
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,070
Got it.

734
00:36:29,510 --> 00:36:30,530
Sit tight.

735
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,970
It's Mu Qing's.

736
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,320
He's so tight-lipped.

737
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:24,560
He won't talk.

738
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:26,050
Stubborn?

739
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,520
I like the stubborn type.

740
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,580
We can just chop off one of his legs.

741
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,250
He's a professional killer.

742
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,520
Chopping off his leg

743
00:40:36,830 --> 00:40:38,420
is good for his reputation.

744
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,870
What should we do then?

745
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:42,990
Let me try.

746
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,080
[I told you to show her around.]

747
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:51,260
I didn't ask you to take her

748
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,760
to a filthy place like that.

749
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,170
Is the Butcher's lair

750
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,800
a place for a girl?

751
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,780
What if something bad happened?

752
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,100
What would you do?

753
00:40:59,930 --> 00:41:01,030
I'm sorry, Mr. Ou.

754
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,440
We should've been more thoughtful.

755
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:03,940
It's my fault, Godfather.

756
00:41:06,930 --> 00:41:09,040
Kexin, there's nothing for you here.

757
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,450
Go inside.

758
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,620
Of course, there is.

759
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:14,720
I was there too.

760
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,490
-I want to know what happened.
-Didn't I make myself clear?

761
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:20,880
Kexin, listen to your dad.

762
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,110
Get inside.

763
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:34,430
I'll get going.

764
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,350
I'm leaving.

765
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:48,290
