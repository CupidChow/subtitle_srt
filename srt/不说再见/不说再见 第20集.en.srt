54
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,200

I don't think
you can do anything about it.

I'll take care of it.

60
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:07,970
You can do as you wish,

61

62
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,360
Okay.

63
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:12,460
Thank you, Director Liu.

64

You've seen that thing, right?

65
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,550
It was Linda's.

66
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:32,000
What's surprising about that?

67
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,360
Don't you see it often?

68
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,050
Its composition

69
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,940
is just like Mr. Scorpion's.

70
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,550
Scorpion?

71
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,450
Isn't he dead?

72
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:45,950
Was he resurrected?

73
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,010
Did someone deliberately imitate

74
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,290
Mr. Scorpion's technique?

75
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:51,010
Who has the guts to do that?

76
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:56,810
So we should get to the bottom of this.

77
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,130
How do we do that?

78
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,580
Get close to Linda.

79
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,340
Why are you here?

80
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,840
I'm here as a coach.

81

82

-I'm not afraid.
-Do you know how to play?

83
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,740
Look at your hand.

84

Hook it.

85
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,580
Next time you compete with her,

86
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,070
it will be a quick kill.

87

It's still early.

88
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,640
Let's watch a movie together.

89

A movie?

I didn't get much sleep.

91

You guys go ahead.

How boring.

93
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,110
What about you, Kexin?

94
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,650
We can go together.

95
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,100
I'm tired too. I won't go either.

96
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,600
You didn't get much sleep too?

97
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,530
-I got it.
-What are you implying?

98
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,340
I got it. Get some rest.

99

Let's go.

100
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:02,640
Kexin, I'll walk you out.

101
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,600
It's okay.

102
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,870
Watching a movie is the best way to rest.

103
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,840
You won't understand.

104
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,850
Forget it. Let's go.

105
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,040
Let's go watch a movie.

106
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,400
Thank you.

107
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,159
I'm home. Bye.

108
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,210
I'll walk you upstairs.

109
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,270
It's okay.

110
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:43,950
I'll only feel better

111
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,180
if I walk you upstairs.

112
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,530
Do you put so much effort

113
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,070
into every woman?

114
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,120
No.

115
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:04,150
Only with you.

116
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,250
All right.

117
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,190
I got home safely.

118
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,520
You don't have to worry about me.

119
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,960
Aren't you going to invite me in?

120
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,180
It's too late.

121
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,409
We went out the whole day.

122
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,780
If I were to drive back now,

123
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,540
I might doze off while driving.

124
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,550
It's not safe.

125
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,580
I'll call you a driver.

126
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:51,180
Logically speaking,

127
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,940
you were with me all day.

128
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,310
I'm very happy.

129
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,730
But who are you?

130
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,310
Who am I?

131
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,640
What do you want?

132
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,050
What do I want?

133
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,510
We both know it better than anyone.

134
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,760
I can't give you what you want.

135
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,780
But I only want you.

136
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,480
We just met.

137
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:14,810
Stop going overboard with your flirting.

138
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:16,220
I'm not flirting.

139
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,520
I had never been so serious

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,150
about a woman before.

141
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:22,860
You're right.

142
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,840
I know who you are

143
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,820
and what you want.

144
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:28,800
I can give it to you.

145
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:34,340
Give me the phone.

146
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,679
Give it back.

147
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,830
Give it back!

148
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,260
If you need me,

149
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,380
call me anytime.

150
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,000
My phone is on 24 hours.

151
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:35,330
Hey.

152
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:36,870
I've confirmed it.

153
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:48,310
[Group K, Dakun, Glasses,
Congtou, Tieguanyin]

154
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,360
Since you think

155
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,640
they don't work for Scorpion,

156
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:53,150
then who are we dealing with?

157
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,000
Using Scorpion's technique

158
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,620
and delivering large quantities

159
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,780
to the fashion circle
that's beyond Scorpion's bounds.

160
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,230
Not only did they not cover it up,

161
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,600
but the price is also cheap.

162
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,400
That means, firstly,

163
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,600
this person is using Scorpion as a shield

164
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,570
to confuse us.

165
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,540
Secondly,

166
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,560
they have a stable supply

167
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,450
and want to gain profit through quantity.

168
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,460
Someone like this

169
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,470
is very likely a new big player.

170
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:17,790
Spectre's subordinate?

171
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:21,570
But Mr. Ou holds this territory.

172
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,460
It's just speculation for now.

173
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:24,690
We don't have proof yet.

174
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:26,190
But...

175
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:29,970
Although this woman is used as a front,

176
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,820
her presence

177
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,290
and the boss hiding behind her

178
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,090
show that we're about to face

179
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:37,940
a tougher situation.

180
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,700
The one thing we can do now

181
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,460
is to find this woman.

182
00:10:41,590 --> 00:10:42,730
And through her,

183
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,760
we'll find out the mastermind.

184
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:48,280
[Scorpion? Linda]

185
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,800
Come in.

186
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,430
Director Liu.

187
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:56,550
It seems Liu Qingqing

188
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,050
is the only breakthrough indeed.

189
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,420
I already found out

190
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,740
that a guy among the captives

191
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,240
is close with Liu Qingqing.

192
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,480
I want to meet Liu Qingqing through him.

193
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,290
Liu Qingqing's phone and address.

194
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,870
I already got them for you.

195
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,590
[Cooperate and gain leniency.]

196
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,000
[I know this rule.]

197
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,520
[But Linda is smart.]

198
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:20,530
After all these years,

199
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,760
I don't even know her name.

200
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,390
She always contacts me.

201
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,930
I've never contacted her.

202
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,830
Can your plan really work?

203
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,290
I ask for your cooperation,

204
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,520
not your questions.

205
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,100
What lies in front of you

206
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,650
is a great opportunity
to make a contribution.

207
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,890
Think about it.

208
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:42,000
It's my fault for being blinded by money.

209
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,910
This is Linda's phone number.

210
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:53,970
Call her.

211
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,630
Who is this?

212
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,740
Ms. Linda, it's me.

213
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,680
Xiaochang.

214
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,140
Xiaochang?

215
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,300
You got the wrong number.

216
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,980
Look. It's a bust.

217
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,780
What do you call methamphetamine?

218
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,590
"Stage suits."

219
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:43,950
What about the unit?

220
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,920
"Pieces."

221
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,280
One catty is one piece.

222
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,500
[I need 1,200 pieces of stage outfits.]

223
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,660
[New dealer. Please respond.]

224
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,770
Do you know this number?

225
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:03,240
No.

226
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:05,700
If it's Liu Qingqing,

227
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,110
remember what I told you?

228
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,080
I remember.

229
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,710
I'll say as you instructed.

230
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,050
[Xiaochang.]

231
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,330
Ms. Linda.

232
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,490
What's the background of this buyer?

233
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:19,830
[The police separated us a few days ago.]

234
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,810
-Amazing.
[-I've been hiding at my friend's house]

235
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:22,950
[-for the past few days.]
-It worked.

236
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,550
This guy is a friend of my friend.

237
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,390
Answer me.

238
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,850
Who is this person?

239
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:32,010
Ms. Linda, let's talk in person.

240
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,550
It's hard to explain over the phone.

241
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,900
Are you sure he wants that much?

242
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:39,450
Yes, he wants 1,200 pieces.

243
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:43,010
Where are you now?

244
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,600
Turn on your front camera.

245
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,830
Go somewhere else in ten minutes.

246
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,070
Say something.

247
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,480
[What's wrong?]

248
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,650
Ms. Linda, I have a bad signal here.

249
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:00,700
Give me ten minutes.

250
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,370
I'll make a video call somewhere else.

251
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,280
Three minutes, or forget it.

252
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:09,940
Zheng Ke!

253
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,400
I'm coming!

254
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,020
Hurry up!

255
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:28,990
Are you ready?

256
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,800
Zheng Ke, are you ready?

257
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,160
Just wait a little longer!

258
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,640
Hurry up!

259
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,580
Hurry up!

260
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,690
She's calling!

261
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,620
We're done here!

262
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,250
Zheng Ke, hurry up.

263
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,220
Okay.

264
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:07,580
It's done!

265
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,860
Stay still.

266
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,190
Cooperate.

267
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,770
[It has been a while, Linda.]

268
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,020
You have a lot of luck.

269
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:25,140
Ms. Linda, you have no idea.

270
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:27,510
I almost died these past two days.

271
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,400
[Get to the point. Let's talk business.]

272
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,790
Mr. Zhao said he wanted 1,200 pieces.

273
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,990
Cash only. No delays.

274
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,090
He'll take it and leave.

275
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,130
Ms. Linda, do you have that many goods?

276
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,450
It's none of your business.

277
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,990
Who exactly is Mr. Zhao?

278
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,970
Mr. Zhao is a friend of my best buddy

279
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,600
who would risk his life for me.

280
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,620
After chatting with him,
he seems pretty reliable.

281
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:48,590
Ms. Linda.

282
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,080
It's hard to talk over the phone.

283
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,450
Let's meet.

284
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:53,080
[Okay.]

285
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:56,550
[I'll tell you when and where.]

286
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:15,560
Sir.

287
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,579
What were you doing with this cloth?

288
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,609
Get ready.

289
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:22,069
Once Liu Qingqing calls, let's move out.

290
00:17:22,770 --> 00:17:23,650
Take him away.

291
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,589
Let's go.

292
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,060
Good job.

293
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,860
A thousand and two hundred pieces

294
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:46,580
is a lot of money.

295
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:49,660
Did you look into the buyer?

296
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,850
I did.

297
00:17:51,330 --> 00:17:52,650
[You know our rules.]

298
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,940
[Doing business is good.]

299
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,360
[But don't get yourself burned.]

300
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,590
I understand.

301
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,750
I've been dealing with Xiaochang

302
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:01,890
for a long time.

303
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:03,250
I probed him too.

304
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,450
There won't be a problem.

305
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,300
Don't worry.

306
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,060
If there's any problem,

307
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,780
I won't drag you down.

308
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:12,930
That's good.

309
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,050
Arrange it quickly.

310
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,080
[As for the task I assigned you,]

311
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,840
how did it go?

312
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,260
Li Ruosheng has taken the bait.

313
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,590
Ou Kexin is starting to get jealous.

314
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,910
She argued with Mu Qing.

315
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,160
[I can't overdo it either.]

316
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,270
[Otherwise, it would be too obvious.]

317
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,490
That means it's almost time then.

318
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:38,320
All right.

319
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,260
Thank you for your hard work.

320
00:19:42,650 --> 00:19:43,620
Did you see that?

321
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,440
You're so cunning.

322
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,220
What other tricks do you have?

323
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,760
I have other tricks indeed.

324
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:54,310
But I'm afraid you'll have to take a trip.

325
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:55,450
What?

326
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,000
Shiguang Flower Shop on Zhongshan Road.

327
00:19:58,090 --> 00:19:59,240
I ordered a bouquet.

328
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,690
You'll deliver it for me.

329
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,240
Why don't you go?

330
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:04,250
Do you need a reason

331
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,010
to do something for me now?

332
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,600
Look, I haven't eaten all day.

333
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,560
My food just arrived.

334
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:10,060
Can't you let me have a few bites?

335
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:11,910
Excuse me.

336
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:13,840
Where are my sandwich and pasta?

337
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:14,940
Hurry up.

338
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,220
I'm telling you.

339
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,320
In half an hour,

340
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:19,170
I need to send fabric to Ou Kexin.

341
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,930
It's not like you don't know her.

342
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,770
I don't know
what has gotten into her lately.

343
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,310
She's being ridiculous.

344
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,250
Don't cause me any trouble.

345
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,530
What has gotten into her?

346
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,640
She's jealous.

347
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,720
But with our current situation,

348
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:33,990
I couldn't care less.

349
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:36,280
You should know
which one is more important.

350
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,310
[Ou Kexin]

351
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,930
Speak of the devil.

352
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,210
I need to take this.

353
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,220
Go ahead.

354
00:20:50,490 --> 00:20:51,640
Zhongshan Road.

355
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,930
Shiguang Flower Shop.

356
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,960
[Ou Kexin]

357
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,720
[Ou Kexin]

358
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:09,850
[Hello, Qingqing.]

359
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:11,000
Where are you?

360
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:12,580
You know I'm waiting for the fabric.

361
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,120
Why are you dillydallying?

362
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,090
Are you weaving?

363
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,230
Ms. Ou.

364
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,910
I'm already on my way.

365
00:21:18,210 --> 00:21:20,060
Please wait for a while. I'm almost there.

366
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:21,210
I'm telling you.

367
00:21:21,290 --> 00:21:23,270
If you don't reach here in ten minutes,

368
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,420
you don't have to come.

369
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,470
Do you hear me?

370
00:21:25,690 --> 00:21:27,810
Don't be mad. I'm almost...

371
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,830
You're 20 minutes late.

372
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,020
I'm giving you a bad review.

373
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,310
How could I be 20 minutes late?

374
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,590
I'll move them in right now.

375
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:03,180
Ms. Ou, I'll give him a hand.

376
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,030
Give me a good review.

377
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,570
Hurry up. You talk too much.

378
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:24,780
What's so funny?

379
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,180
Why are you dillydallying?

380
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,650
Hurry up. We need to use the fabric.

381
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,670
What time is it now?

382
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,860
I'm almost done.

383
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,490
Can you be more reliable?

384
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,790
Ms. Ou, I think he bought you flowers.

385
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,000
How could I be 20 minutes late?

386
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,450
It's definitely within ten minutes.

387
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,720
Watch him.

388
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:10,850
[Even the loneliest person
has the right to enjoy love.]

389
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,910
How silly.

390
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,860
All right, I'm leaving.

391
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,530
Are you leaving?

392
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,850
You're not done.

393
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:35,270
It's done.

394
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,520
Didn't you want three rolls of fabric?

395
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,060
I already moved them.

396
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:44,340
I see.

397
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,800
Go on with your date.

398
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,510
Go ahead.

399
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,980
What date? I'm with Li Ruosheng every day.

400
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:52,080
Who's there to date?

401
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,190
Stop explaining.

402
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,260
She's waiting. Hurry up.

403
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,340
Why are you getting mad?
You're being ridiculous.

404
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,580
I was nice enough
to carry everything for you.

405
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,830
I hope you have a good time.

406
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,550
I'm happy and having fun.

407
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,580
Drive safely. Don't rush it.

408
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,050
Thank you!

409
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:53,240
I'm coming.

410
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:28,440
Did you deliver it?

411
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,700
How can you be so sure

412
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,640
she would know that it's from you?

413
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:38,340
Linda is very rational.

414
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,810
Honey.

415
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,830
Li Ruosheng, are you stalking me?

416
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,870
What do you mean by stalking?

417
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,330
Life requires a sense of occasion.

418
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,870
Let me warn you.

419
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,420
Keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.

420
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,880
I'm not buying it.

421
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,520
If you stalk me one more time,

422
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,080
I would think you're a pervert.

423
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,680
Okay.

424
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,050
You're beautiful, so you're always right.

425
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:14,720
Are you free tonight?

426
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:16,130
Let's have dinner.

427
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,450
What? Did Linda hang up?

428
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,400
Your trick didn't work either.

429
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,380
If that didn't work,

430
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,360
I still have a trick up my sleeve.

431
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,160
When did you install this?

432
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:51,510
Logically speaking,

433
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,440
you were with me all day.

434
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:54,810
I'm very happy.

435
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:57,580
But who are you?

436
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,120
Who am I?

437
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,890
This woman

438
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,440
is the ever-changing Sun Wukong.

439
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,220
I'm the ever-steady Buddha.

440
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,990
No one can escape
from the palm of my hand.

441
00:27:11,170 --> 00:27:13,590
I won't let anyone take anything from me.

442
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,380
How arrogant.

443
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:20,110
With your palms so big,

444
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,000
be careful not to hit your face.

445
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,450
[Ou Kexin]

446
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,810
She's calling me nonstop.

447
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,360
Find out who is Liu Qingqing's higher-up.

448
00:27:34,450 --> 00:27:35,330
Remember to call me.

449
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,560
Go on.

450
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:52,360
Mu Qing.

451
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,050
Why are you here?

452
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,390
I came to deliver something.

453
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,050
I had no idea you were so romantic.

454
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,270
Were these really from you?

455
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,170
How is that possible?

456
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:11,190
Of course not.

457
00:28:12,110 --> 00:28:14,140
I don't think that's what Linda said.

458
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,780
They're really not from me.

459
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,950
That's impossible. I think it was you.

460
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,800
Because I smelled perfume

461
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:27,380
in my hallway at the time.

462
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,880
It's what you usually wear.

463
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,370
If it was Li Ruosheng,

464
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,960
he would've delivered them himself,

465
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:33,280
since he's so shameless.

466
00:28:33,370 --> 00:28:34,380
Am I right, Kexin?

467
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:38,820
Linda, you can't joke about this.

468
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,030
It's most likely him who gave you these.

469
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,530
He asked his men to deliver them.

470
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,470
I happened to wear the same perfume.

471
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:50,660
Mu Qing.

472
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,370
Look into my eyes.

473
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,090
If you're lying to me,

474
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,850
I'll poke you blind.

475
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,490
You can't accuse me.

476
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,510
Call Li Ruosheng if you don't believe me.

477
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,140
Ask him who sent those.

478
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,150
Forget it.

479
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,000
Let's say these are from Li Ruosheng.

480
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,200
He's such a player.

481
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,480
I don't want to see him.

482
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,280
I'll leave these with you for now.

483
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,860
He's not like you.

484
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,320
Not like him?

485
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,000
Then tell me.

486
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,320
What kind of person is he?

487
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,370
He's a good guy.

488
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,270
"A good guy"?

489
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,560
He's always on someone's mind.

490
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:28,100
Isn't that right, Linda?

491
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,930
Thank goodness

492
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,830
Mu Qing is an honest person.

493
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,370
He's so well-behaved.

494
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,260
Even if he plucks up the courage,

495
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,540
he won't dare to do anything.

496
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,040
-Am I right?
-Yes.

497
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,220
Whatever you say.

498
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,130
Mu Qing, are you free tomorrow night?

499
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:47,060
I want to treat you to a meal.

500
00:29:47,370 --> 00:29:49,480
I want to thank you
for helping me last time.

501
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,430
You scared me. It's just dinner, right?

502
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,190
I told you we have dinner plans

503
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,390
for tomorrow night.

504
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,900
I need to tailor your shirt.

505
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:00,130
Did you gain weight recently?

506
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,160
Let me measure you.

507
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,830
Measuring with my hands is the best.

508
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,910
You've really gained some weight.

509
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,800
Fine, but don't say it out loud.

510
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:14,740
It's my fault for feeding you too well.

511
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,710
Am I right?

512
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:16,940
I shouldn't let you eat

513
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,260
so much high-calorie food.

514
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,580
I'll get going then.

515
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,250
You didn't take your things.

516
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,990
They are yours.

517
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,970
Thank you.

518
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,180
Bye, see you.

519
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,330
You're so romantic these days.

520
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,520
You've really gained weight.

521
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:43,820
Not bad.

522
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:44,920
She's gone. Stop acting.

523
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,910
What's for dinner tonight?

524
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:51,130
You should just have an apple.

525
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:55,350
Are you really mad?

526
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,780
Hey, the show is over.

527
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:12,690
-Give me some.
-No.

528
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,360
-Just give me a little.
-No.

529
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,810
You bought so much.

530
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,090
Won't you let me have some?

531
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:19,460
You've gained so much weight. Stop eating.

532
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,570
-Am I fat?
-That's right.

533
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,200
How could I have gained weight?

534
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,520
Who else is fat if not you?

535
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:25,930
Little pig.

536
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:27,070
Rong Yu.

537
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:28,610
I've been working out every day.

538
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:30,020
I'm sick of egg whites.

539
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:32,090
We need to spice up our lives.

540
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,500
-Just give me a little.
-No.

541
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,300
-Just a bit.
-Stop!

542
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:38,340
This one is low in calories. Eat this.

543
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,660
Eat this.

544
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,030
Just eat this until you lose weight, okay?

545
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:44,540
-Just this?
-That's right.

546
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,960
Let me deal with this one.

547
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:51,710
-It's delicious!
-No.

548
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,390
Fruits are good indeed.

549
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:55,670
But I can't keep eating it, right?

550
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,700
Rong Yu.

551
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,240

-Captain Rong.
-Take a bite.

563
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,630
Buns?

564
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,640
Thank you.

565
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,000
Liu Qingqing.

566
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,670
Wake up!

567
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,380
Don't talk.

568
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:08,540
[Loyal and diligent, Sharp and brave]

569
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,530
Are we arresting Liu Qingqing?

570
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,510
There's no rush.
We'll catch a bigger fish.

571
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:07,960
Xiaochang and Liu Qingqing

572
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,280
have arranged a meeting place.

573
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:11,530
We only have one hour to prepare.

574
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,800
Zheng Ke.

575
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,610
Telecom signals from three blocks away

576
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,020
must be under our surveillance.

577
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:16,980
Three blocks away?

578
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,830
Liu Qingqing is most likely just a pawn.

579
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,550
She might be working for someone else.

580
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:21,650
I understand.

581
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,700
Zhao Ran.

582
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,680
I'll disguise myself and go in with you.

583
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,180
That's not all.

584
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,420
This time, you're Mr. Zhao from Shanghai,

585
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,400
an electronic component businessman.

586
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,040
Don't worry. It's a piece of cake.

587
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,080
What about me?

588
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,840
-This time, you...
-Sir!

589
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,000
What about me?

590
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,240
I'm late again.

591
00:33:56,010 --> 00:33:58,030
You've been working overtime for days.

592
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,450
Didn't I ask you to go home and rest?

593
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,260
I'm fine.

594
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,630
I can't sleep with everyone on duty.

595
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,440
-You...
-I promise you.

596
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,710
As soon as I'm done,

597
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,650
I'll sleep like a baby.

598
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,150
Why are you so stubborn?

599
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,420
Aren't you stubborn too?

600
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,440
All right then.

601
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,370
Li Yimeng will disguise
as Zhao Ran's secretary.

602
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,060
Get into the character.

603
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,070
Yes!

604
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,290
Even she gets a mission.

605
00:34:27,429 --> 00:34:28,480
What will I be doing?

606
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:30,370
You...

607
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,400
You'll drive.

608
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:37,810
What are you laughing at?

609
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,969
Driving is also a difficult task, okay?

610
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:41,239
Stay seated.

611
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,270
You can't even drive if you wanted to.

612
00:34:57,610 --> 00:34:59,990
Where are you going, you little rascal?

613
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,760
Let's see

614
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:04,830
how long you can keep up the act.

615
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,460
Captain Rong.

616
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:22,430
I've accessed

617
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:23,970
the teahouse's interior CCTV system.

618
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,680
What about the exterior CCTVs?

619
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:27,440
I've informed the city traffic police.

620
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,540
I just need to do this

621
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:31,620
to monitor everything.

622
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,250
Okay, good job.

623
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,150
How is it? Are you ready?

624
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,160
-I'm ready.
-Yes.

625
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,820

It's working.

628
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:05,900
Your earphone.

629
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,030
It's hidden this way.

630
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:19,540
Be careful.

631
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,820
When you go inside,
this camera must follow Liu Qingqing.

632
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:23,850
Copy that!

633
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,990
Move out.

634
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:43,520
Hello.

635
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,540
I'm so sorry.

Don't worry.

638
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,720
All right.

639
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:51,790

you're so beautiful and elegant.

Mr. Zhao, you're too kind.

When Mr. Zhao is doing business,

there are rules to follow.

00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,670
We don't know each other very well.

682
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,250
So my boss won't meet you rashly.

683
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,700
What are you saying?

684
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:15,110
You look down on us, don't you?

685
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,960
Let's put ourselves in each other's shoes.

686
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:18,980
Would you work

687
00:40:19,110 --> 00:40:20,430
with an incautious businessman?

688
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,320
It's not about being cautious.

689
00:40:22,410 --> 00:40:23,910
It's a matter of sincerity.

690
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:25,760
What are you doing?

691
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,250
You don't have a say in this.

692
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,900
Ms. Linda is right.

693
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,750
Compared to you guys,

694
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:35,080
I'm just a rookie.

695
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,280
There are many things

696
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,010
I have to learn from you and your boss.

697
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,170
But as you can see,

698
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,730
we have nothing else.

699
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:54,660
We only have two things.

700
00:40:55,010 --> 00:40:56,910
Money and sincerity.

701
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:00,820
[But I don't know]

702
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:04,120
[when I'll get to see your boss.]

703
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:07,110
Although this is business,

704
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:09,400
we still need to build friendship, right?

705
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,940
However,

706
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,020
for so many items,

707
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:15,910
this sincerity

708
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:18,070
isn't enough.

709
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:25,150
Isn't money the problem then?

710
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:26,430
That's easy.

711
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,850
Let's reschedule the meeting.

712
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,970
I'll bring you the rest of my money.

713
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:40,330
