00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:19,160
[You found Kexin?]

171
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,840
[Yes.]

172
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:21,980
[Kexin and Mr. Ou]

173
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,300
[were ambushed by the police.]

174
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:25,500
[Kexin jumped off the boat
and was injured.]

175
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,000
[She was rescued by some fishermen.]

176
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,490
[When she came ashore,]

177
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,770
[she contacted me right away.]

178
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,570
[She's with me now.]

179
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:32,539
[She's safe.]

180
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,700
How about Godfather?

181
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,030
Where's Godfather now?

182
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,299
I haven't heard from Mr. Ou either.

183
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,890
Okay.

184
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,370
I called to tell you

185
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:51,240
that Spectre is in Yungang.

186
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,700
[We've set up a meeting.]

187
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,950
He'll inform me

188
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,710
of the time and place to meet soon.

189
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,650
Li Ruosheng managed to contact Spectre.

190
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,620
That's right.

191
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,900
Have you located him?

192
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,880
He's using virtual phone system.

193
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,150
It will take some time.

194
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:10,110
[Ruosheng.]

195
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:11,700
The situation is tense.

196
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,810
Aren't you taking a big risk?

197
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,440
I don't care anymore.

198
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:18,030
Godfather has prepared for this deal

199
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,630
for such a long time.

200
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,060
Now that he's missing,

201
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:26,040
the group can only rely on me.

202
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:29,740
Will you help me?

203
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,640
Yes.

204
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,180
Of course I'll help you, Ruosheng.

205
00:09:34,930 --> 00:09:36,290
[Meet me at 36, Chengbei Street,]

206
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,360
at 5 p.m. tomorrow.

207
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:40,120
Let's talk in person.

208
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,290
The call was too short.

209
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:48,440
We couldn't locate him.

210
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,450
Captain Rong, what do we do?

211
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,710
Have you checked the place

212
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,900
that Li Ruosheng mentioned?

213
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:14,090
Yes.

214
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,110
It's just a small restaurant.

215
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,480
The owner is from Sichuan

216
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,710
with no criminal record.

217
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,380
There's nowhere to hide in there either.

218
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:23,110
If there's anything out of the ordinary
with Li Ruosheng,

219
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,250
we'll move in at once.

220
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,630
Be safe.

221
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,600
Yes.

222
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,200
You're awake.

223
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,610
Let's have breakfast.

224
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,970
It feels like a dream.

225
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,170
So from now on,

226
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,020
you'll be living in a dream each day.

227
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,430
You're meeting Li Ruosheng this afternoon.

228
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,100
Are you confident?

229
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,420
You don't have to worry about that.

230
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,760
I know Li Ruosheng the best.

231
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,060
That's why everything is under my control.

232
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,740
I know it will all be over

233
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,030
after we use Li Ruosheng to catch Spectre.

234
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:28,760
But are you sure you can do it?

235
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,530
That day when I had to arrest Ou Zhenhai,

236
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,130
I almost couldn't bring myself to do it.

237
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,590
That's why I'm worried about you.

238
00:11:43,890 --> 00:11:45,740
One has to pay the price

239
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,070
for making the wrong choice.

240
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,930
Wait for me.

241
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,320
Are you not eating?

242
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,370
Wait for me.

243
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,660
Hurry up. It's getting cold.

244
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,240
What's wrong?

245
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,370
I...

246
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:36,690
I was planning to wait

247
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,970
until the mission is over.

248
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,640
But I'm afraid

249
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:41,180
we'll be getting another mission.

250
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,760
So...

251
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:45,750
I cherish each day that we have together.

252
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,830
I proposed to you three years ago

253
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,830
and promised to take good care of you.

254
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,760
But I failed.

255
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,270
This time, I promise

256
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:57,940
what happened back then

257
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,260
will never happen again.

258
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,990
I'll always be with you

259
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,790
and love you.

260
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:06,350
No matter what,

261
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,590
I'll always be by your side.

262
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,420
Rong Yu.

263
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,010
Will you marry me?

264
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:23,990
Yes.

265
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,640
[What's the situation?]

266
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:52,100
Ground floor, all clear.

267
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:54,830
Second floor, all clear.

268
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,860
Come on.

269
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:02,000
Drink up.

270
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,370
What's going on?

271
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,880
There's a group of people drinking here.

272
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,370
Here. I'll pour it for you.

273
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:09,790
Attention, everyone.

274
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:10,850
Don't blow your cover

275
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,170
unless it threatens the safety

276
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,310
of our undercover agents.

277
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,370
Don't tip them off.

278
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,390
[Yes.]

279
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:34,520
Look, he's here.

280
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,600
Attention, everyone.

281
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,090
Mu Qing has arrived.

282
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:49,920
Hello.

283
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,150
Mr. Li booked a room.

284
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:53,970
It's on the second floor, room 49.

285
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,510
Thank you.

286
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,320
He has gone upstairs.

287
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:47,690
The undercover agent has arrived.

288
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,020
Stay alert.

289
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:51,610
[Yes.]

290
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:18,840
What do you mean by that?

291
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:19,940
Do you have a death wish?

292
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,350
Are you drunk?

293
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,540
Stop him!

294
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:24,380
Don't get in my way!

295
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,230
I'm going to beat you up!

296
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,240
All right! Knock it off!

297
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:28,430
What are you doing?

298
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,800
Stop it!

299
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,640
Say it again!

300
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,830
Stop it!

301
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,280
[It's not safe here.]

302
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,040
[I've sent my men
to secretly protect you.]

303
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:37,360
[No one will dare approach you.]

304
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,210
-Stop fighting!
[-Go to the back alley now.]

305
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,620
[There's a car
with its double signals on.]

306
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,980
[He'll take you to my place.]

307
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:43,440
[If anyone follows you,]

308
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,120
[I'll make sure
they won't leave this place alive.]

309
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,230
How am I going to run the business?

310
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:50,040
-Do you think you can beat me?
-Stop!

311
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,660
Stop it!

312
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,730
-Don't get in my way!
-Someone is fighting!

313
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:54,920
Stop!

314
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,520
-Hit him!
-Hit me!

315
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,480
Stop it!

316
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,620
That's enough! Stop fighting!

317
00:17:02,970 --> 00:17:03,850
Are you okay?

318
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,130
Go to your mom.

319
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,200
No, can you blame me?

320
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,349
All right, everyone shut up.

321
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,410
Captain Rong,
there are drunk people fighting.

322
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,380
Something isn't right.

323
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:13,089
Go inside and check the place.

324
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,150
If you keep fighting,

325
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,339
how can I run the business?

326
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:17,099
If you keep fighting,

327
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,280
who's going to pay?

328
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,020
That's enough.

329
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:22,990
Stop talking.

330
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,000
This is bad.

331
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:29,940
Look.

332
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,920
[I can manage. Don't follow me.]

333
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,000
Captain Rong, something is wrong.
Mu Qing is gone.

334
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,600
He left his phone on the table
with a text from an unknown number.

335
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,740
What's happening?

336
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,380
I think it was from Li Ruosheng.

337
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,730
Mu Qing is being watched.

338
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:47,230
Let's talk on our way out.

339
00:17:47,890 --> 00:17:50,010
I think Li Ruosheng purposely
picked this place.

340
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,150
I bet he set up the fight

341
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,210
in the restaurant too.

342
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,230
Zheng Ke.

343
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,590
Check the CCTV in the vicinity.

344
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,560
Got it.

345
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,290
Captain Rong.

346
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,800
There's no sign of Mu Qing
at the front or the back exit.

347
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,160
It's not like he could fly away!

348
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:15,440
Keep looking!

349
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:46,410
Hello, Mr. Li.

350
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:47,950
He has left.

351
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,100
No one is tailing him.

352
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:50,950
Okay.

353
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:38,550
Hello.

354
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:39,650
How is it going?

355
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,020
Is there any sign of Li Ruosheng?

356
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,070
He didn't show up.

357
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:43,700
Yuanwen is missing.

358
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,550
What did you say?

359
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,560
Yuanwen is missing?

360
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,140
We're doing our best to track him.

361
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:49,550
We'll find him.

362
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,560
Don't worry.

363
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,680
I'm coming over.

364
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:00,070
Captain Rong, there's a situation.

365
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,080
What is it?

366
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,090
A few days ago,

367
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:04,420
our guys have been trying
to trace Li Ruosheng.

368
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,200
Based on the CCTV footage from Sky Eye,

369
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,220
he has been frequenting a clubhouse.

370
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,940
Could he have taken Mu Qing there?

371
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,990
Show it to me.

372
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,860
Pull up this one.

373
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,200
What's in his hand?

374
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,300
Zoom in.

375
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,020
Li Ruosheng already knew

376
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,640
the identity of the undercover agent.

377
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,410
Attention, everyone.

378
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,390
Go to the clubhouse at once
to arrest Li Ruosheng

379
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,850
and rescue our undercover agent!

380
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:53,010
Here you are.

381
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,480
What are you doing?

382
00:21:55,830 --> 00:21:57,280
I have no idea why.

383
00:21:57,370 --> 00:21:59,610
I just couldn't start the fire.

384
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,080
Come on.

385
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,280
Are you going to have a hot pot here?

386
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,750
Who says we can't have a hot pot here?

387
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:10,220
All right. It's almost done.

388
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,220
Come. Let's eat.

389
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,750
How fastidious.

390
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:30,810
Have a seat.

391
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,280
Is there any sea cucumber?

392
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:36,000
I went to the market this morning,

393
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:37,060
but there wasn't any.

394
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,240
Just make do with it.

395
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,750
But I love sea cucumber.

396
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:41,850
Wipe your hands.

397
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:44,320
Why are you still the same?

398
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,120
Jeez. I'll help myself.

399
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,800
Here.

400
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,950
Have some meat.

401
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:03,280
Come on.

402
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,650
Move in!

403
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,890
-Let's go!
-Yes.

404
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,420
The police are here.

405
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:57,310
-Let's go somewhere else.
-Where are we going?

406
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,950
Where's Li Ruosheng? I want to see him.

407
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,180
I'll take you to him now.

408
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,290
Yimeng, let's split up.

409
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,010
-Take one team with you.
-Come with me.

410
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:12,970
-Move.
-Yes.

411
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:15,750
Don't move!

412
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:17,950
Get down!

413
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:19,930
Have some.

414
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,390
Here.

415
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,740
Well, here's to us.

416
00:24:31,810 --> 00:24:34,360
We survived

417
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,550
and get to meet again.

418
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:44,650
It has been three years.

419
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,220
Time went by so quickly.

420
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,150
It felt like

421
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,820
it was just yesterday.

422
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:55,430
How did things turn out this way?

423
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,770
What's your plan for the future?

424
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:04,720
The future?

425
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,100
I haven't thought about it.

426
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,210
Do you remember

427
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,010
where we first drank together?

428
00:25:15,850 --> 00:25:16,950
Of course.

429
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:18,050
You're the only one

430
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,900
who would have a hot pot for breakfast.

431
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,580
You little brat

432
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,650
delivered your opening gambit
when you first came.

433
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,580
Three rules.

434
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:27,860
First.

435
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:30,280
I have to do as you say.

436
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,420
Second.

437
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,540
A man can't shed tears easily.

438
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,770
Third.

439
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,700
Cut waste and extravagance.

440
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:38,770
After you said that,

441
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,220
I accepted you as my friend.

442
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,190
Am I right?

443
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,080
Eat up.

444
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:45,110
-Okay.
-Cut waste and extravagance.

445
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,110
Here.

446
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,620
As for the second toast,

447
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,680
it's to you.

448
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,320
I know I've said it countless times

449
00:26:03,410 --> 00:26:04,600
and I'm sick of it myself,

450
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:06,620
but I want to say it again today.

451
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,960
Without you,

452
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,070
I wouldn't be who I am today.

453
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,750
-There you go again.
-Cheers.

454
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,380
As for the third toast,

455
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,600
it's to my godfather.

456
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,820
What are you doing?

457
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:47,980
We still haven't found my godfather.

458
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:50,800
Could he be...

459
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,010
I have something for you.

460
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,330
Here.

461
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:07,390
Come take a look.

462
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:08,750
Bring it here.

463
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,030
Take a look.

464
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:34,890
What is this?

465
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,270
"Kill Mu Qing."

466
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,980
What's this?

467
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,830
Godfather said so.

468
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:03,840
Hello.

469
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,070
[Boss.]

470
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,650
[The clubhouse has been taken.]

471
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,320
[I escaped with our guest.]

472
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,260
[It's surrounded by the police.]

473
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,420
There are police.

474
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,420
Aren't they there to catch Spectre?

475
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,800
Bring Spectre here.

476
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:20,780
Let them come here to get him.

477
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,360
One more thing.

478
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,470
Maintain the vehicle's speed.

479
00:28:25,130 --> 00:28:27,460
Don't let the police lose you.

480
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,300
Captain Rong, we caught two of them.

481
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,620
There's no sign of Li Ruosheng.

482
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:39,870
How is it?

483
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:44,580
How is it?

484
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,960
Captain Rong!

485
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,550
When I checked the CCTV footage,

486
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,020
I saw a car leaving through the back exit
when we got here.

487
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,600
It's heading towards Chengnan Factory.

488
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:54,960
Attention, everyone.

489
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:55,980
The suspect's target

490
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:57,120
should be Chengnan Factory.

491
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:59,230
While we are there
to arrest Li Ruosheng and Spectre,

492
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,640
we must ensure our agent's safety.

493
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,090
-Let's go!
-Yes!

494
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,460
Mu Qing.

495
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,250
I don't even know your real name.

496
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:13,490
I just want to hear you say,

497
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,390
"I'm an undercover agent."

498
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,710
Say it!

499
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,270
Three years.

500
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,490
You've lied to me for three years!

501
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,550
In the past three years,

502
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,450
the only thing I kept from you
was my identity.

503
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,730
You think of me as your friend.

504
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,710
I thought the same about you too.

505
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:55,810
Shut up!

506
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,850
Trust me, Ruosheng.

507
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,710
I'm doing all of this for you.

508
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,260
It's not too late to turn back now.

509
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,400
Turn back?

510
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,830
Where should I turn back to?

511
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,130
Ever since you became my strategist,

512
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,860
there was no turning back for me.

513

515

517

519
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,610
You can't.

520

521
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:42,980

the one you worked so hard to catch.

533
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:44,620
It's unexpected, right?

534
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:46,650
She's a woman.

535
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,320
Shouldn't you thank me?

536

She's my savior.

I remember now.

563
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,180
You once told me

564
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,770
that you hoped no one in this world

565
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,710
would be in this business again.

566

Is that the right path?

567
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,370
You made me your stepping stone

to help you move up the ladder.

569

Is that the right path?

570
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:37,170
You saved me on the rooftop
three years ago.

571
00:33:39,150 --> 00:33:41,480
It was a trap you set.

572
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,740
Like a fool, I felt grateful to you

573

and thought of you as my friend!

574
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,480
Didn't you lie to me for three years

575

576
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:58,560
I'll grant you your wish.

00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,130
We've wrapped things up here.

681
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,530
Two days later,

682
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,600
I have to report back
to the Provincial Public Security Bureau.

683
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,740
I'm worried

684
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,500
about leaving you here alone.

685
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:33,390
Rong Yao.

686
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,240
I'm not a kid anymore.

687
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,260
Besides,

688
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:38,930
I'm not alone either.

689
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,090
I know.

690
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,210
I'm just worried

691
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:46,240
that you can't get over it.

692
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,300
I used to be afraid

693
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,980
that I couldn't be who I was again.

694
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,880
But Yuanwen told me

695
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,100
that no matter how much
I've changed on the outside,

696
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,740
what's on the inside stays the same.

697
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,770
That's right.

698
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,100
As long as I'm a police officer,

699
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:10,830
I will continue to fulfill my duty.

700
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:14,090
As long as there are drug dealers
in this world,

701
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,460
our mission isn't over yet.

702
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:35,870
[In position, I'll see you in ten days.]

703
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,800
Why isn't Mic King here yet?

704
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,910
Is he reliable?

705
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,190
He's totally reliable.

706
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,390
I once dealt with him in Yungang.

707
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,810
He's pretty good.

708
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:21,140
It's also perfectly safe.

709
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,830
So you're Mic King?

710
00:41:45,830 --> 00:41:46,710
Hello.

711
00:41:53,350 --> 00:41:54,230
Hello.

712

["The Place Farthest Away" playing]

713
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,310
♫ Against the light ♫

714
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:04,750
♫ Your vague silhouette ♫

715
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,250
♫ I reach out with my hands ♫

716
00:42:07,390 --> 00:42:10,510
♫ But my hug passes through you ♫

717
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:14,820
♫ Maybe this is an illusion ♫

718
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,800
♫ A sweet dream ♫

719
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,440
♫ Waiting for you ♫

720
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:22,870
♫ To notice it and wake me up ♫

721
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,340
♫ I wonder if getting close to you ♫

722
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,840
♫ One swirl will light up the stars ♫

723
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:34,530
♫ I wonder if someone
will tell you for me ♫

724
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,520
♫ At the place farthest away ♫

725
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:43,900
♫ Only then will the kites roam freely ♫

726
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,280
♫ If I gaze relentlessly ♫

727
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:49,490
♫ I wonder if there will be starlight ♫

728
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,440
♫ If the falling fireworks ♫

729
00:42:52,790 --> 00:42:55,960
♫ Give me the sadness of being lonely ♫

730
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,340
♫ If your gaze gives me ♫

731
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:00,360
♫ A sense of direction ♫

732
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:05,110
♫ I'll give you an answer too ♫

733
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,280
♫ Looking at your turbulent silence ♫

734
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,220
♫ I really hope you can understand ♫

735
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,640
♫ So I remain extremely quiet and gentle ♫

736
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:37,850
♫ Waiting for you to kiss my forehead ♫

737
00:43:38,770 --> 00:43:40,360
♫ It seems you're in front of me ♫

738
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,130
♫ Like the four seasons in my heart ♫

739
00:43:44,930 --> 00:43:46,290
♫ Gentle and heart-wrenching ♫

740
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,200
♫ What can I say? ♫

741
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:52,450
♫ At the place farthest away ♫

742
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,620
♫ Only then will the kites roam freely ♫

743
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:58,260
♫ If I gaze relentlessly ♫

744
00:43:58,350 --> 00:44:01,560
♫ I wonder if there will be starlight ♫

745
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:04,420
♫ Standing on your spot ♫

746
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,940
♫ Only then will I forget
the faraway place ♫

747
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:09,170
♫ Only your gaze ♫

748
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:12,610
♫ Can give me acknowledgment ♫

749
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:18,770
♫ Can give me an answer ♫
