00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,430
Are you okay?

175
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,410
Ruosheng.

176
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:10,990
I'm telling you.

177
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,780
Mu Qing affects the fate of the group.

178
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,110
I hope you know what you're doing.

179
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,180
Mr. Glasses,
let me tell you something too.

180
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,670
All I care about now

181
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,170
is whether my friend lives or dies.

182
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,410
Move aside.

183
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,640
Where did you go?

184
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,530
You were gone for so long.

185
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,070
Why didn't you call me?

186
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,700
I was so worried about you.

187
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,840
How have you been?

188
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,160
How is your previous injury?

189
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,260
Have you fully recovered?

190
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,320
I'm fine.

191
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,520
Why didn't you call me then?

192
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,810
Do you know how worried I was?

193
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,010
Li Ruosheng.

194
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,480
What is going on?

195
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,100
I'm asking you.

196
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,230
Why is Kexin here?

197
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,030
Godfather, it's all my fault.

198
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:04,140
I shouldn't have lied to you.

199
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:08,010
But I couldn't stop Kexin...

200
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:09,510
Why didn't you tell me then?

201
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,150
You can't get rid of her, but I can.

202
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,090
Dad.

203
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,240
I insisted on coming here.

204
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,000
Don't make it hard for Li Ruosheng.

205
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:20,910
Also,

206
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,720
I have a confession to make.

207
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:26,540
I have started getting involved

208
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,780
in our group's business.

209
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,990
What do you mean?

210
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,450
Didn't you ask Mr. Glasses

211
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:35,120
to work with Li Ruosheng?

212
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,210
But Mr. Glasses didn't do as you say.

213
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,500
He purposely made Li Ruosheng look stupid

214
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,390
in front of our usual dealers.

215
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,070
In the end, I had to step in

216
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,630
to convince Xu to continue the shipment.

217
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:51,440
This isn't a collaboration.

218
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:54,480
He's obviously trying to sabotage you.

219
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,120
Nonsense!

220
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,240
It was you who convinced Xu
to deliver the goods?

221
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,450
This is ridiculous!

222
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,920
I just can't stand

223
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,280
how Mr. Glasses likes to bully

224
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,690
Mu Qing and Li Ruosheng.

225
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:10,270
Before this, he framed Mu Qing

226
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,640
and wanted to take him out.

227
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,130
And now,

228
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:15,160
he's plotting against Li Ruosheng.

229
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,490
Dad, if you don't believe me,

230
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,070
just call Xu and ask him.

231
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,660
Let him tell you what happened.

232
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,280
That's enough.

233
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,500
Aren't you preparing for a big deal?

234
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,390
You need trustworthy people around you.

235
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,800
I'm doing you a favor

236
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,030
by helping Li Ruosheng.

237
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,480
Why won't you let me help?

238
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,640
Besides,

239
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,840
I've already gotten myself involved.

240
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,730
It's too late for you to do anything.

241
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,540
I won't allow anymore nonsense from you.

242
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,560
Get out.

243
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:46,260
Fine, I'll leave.

244
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,850
Mu Qing is coming with me.

245
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,210
He's not going anywhere.

246
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,240
From now on, he must live here.

247
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,690
He must not leave my sight.

248
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,740
Why?

249
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:54,710
"Why?"

250
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,340
I want him to. That's why.

251
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,120
-Mu Qing.
-Kexin.

252
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,620
Listen to Mr. Ou.

253
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,830
Mr. Ou, I will stay here.

254
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,720
Ruosheng.

255
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,440
Get her out of here.

256
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:09,980
Yes.

257
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:16,710
Come on.

258
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,000
Take your hand off me. I'll go myself.

259
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,000
Shao Nan.

260
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:32,460
Sir.

261
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,440
Take Mu Qing to the tea room
and wait for me.

262
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:35,940
This way, please.

263
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,840
Sir.

264
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,730
About Xu...

265
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,700
That's enough.

266
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,010
Contact our men in Yunnan.

267
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,510
Look into it again.

268
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:01,810
Yes.

269
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,890
Ms. Ou, you're really something.

270
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,510
Are you happy now?

271
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,890
Not only did Godfather find out
that you're still here,

272
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,610
but he also knows
you're helping the group.

273
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:19,670
How much trouble will you cause me?

274
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:22,180
This isn't something you can hide.

275
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,120
Besides, I was only helping you

276
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:25,830
so that Dad would know
what I'm capable of.

277
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,550
I would be an idiot to not let him know.

278
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,490
I don't need your help.

279
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:32,130
I really don't get it. You...

280
00:16:32,210 --> 00:16:33,800
You're a woman.

281
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:35,600
Why do you want
to get involved in the group?

282
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:36,920
What exactly are you thinking?

283
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,840
If I get caught,

284
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,990
my whole life is done for and that's it.

285
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,090
What do we do now?

286
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,200
Mu Qing is being confined by Godfather.

287
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,170
What do we do?

288
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,020
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

289
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,560
How can I not worry?

290
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,010
How can he be fine?

291
00:16:52,190 --> 00:16:53,600
He's still useful to my dad.

292
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,090
If my dad had wanted to hurt him,

293
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,370
he would have done it already.

294
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:57,860
Fine.

295
00:16:58,570 --> 00:16:59,980
Even if Godfather won't hurt him,

296
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,220
Glasses will.

297
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,550
If my dad won't hurt Mu Qing,

298
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,960
would Glasses dare to hurt him?

299
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,060
What would he tell my dad?

300
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:08,420
He has done it so many times.

301
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,790
This isn't his first day.

302
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:12,869
More importantly, he's guilty right now.

303
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,890
He still hasn't settled his own business.

304
00:17:15,109 --> 00:17:16,300
He won't have the mood.

305
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,270
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

306
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,480
Get in the car.

307
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:41,510
[Come in.]

308
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,660
Rong Yu just informed me.

309
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,080
Yuanwen has indeed
been confined by Mr. Ou.

310
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,710
But he's safe for now.

311
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,750
Rong Yu has also told Mr. Ou everything.

312
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,860
She insisted on joining the business.

313
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,710
Mr. Ou was furious.

314
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:03,910
But there's nothing he can do about it.

315
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:07,430
It seems like

316
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,810
Ou Zhenhai is holding Yuanwen hostage

317
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,570
to find out what he was doing

318
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:15,080
while he went missing for the past month.

319
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,190
We should give our men in Yunnan

320
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,290
a heads-up about it.

321
00:18:18,510 --> 00:18:20,320
Don't worry, I've already informed them.

322
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,370
Tell Rong Yu this.

323
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,880
Infiltrating Group K's business

324
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,790
is only a process, not her goal.

325
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,210
The hardest part is done.

326
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,370
The rest will be easier to deal with.

327
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,790
Okay, I'll contact her.

328
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,810
Okay.

329
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,050
Until Glasses come back
with the information he gathered,

330
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,310
you still have some time.

331
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,400
If he finds out something had happened,

332
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:58,510
then these few hours

333
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:01,850
will be the last moment of your life.

334
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,880
[Mr. Glasses.]

335
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,730
I'm sure this guy named Wang Wen

336
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,440
is the Mu Qing you are looking for.

337
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,640
[As soon as I heard from you,]

338
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:26,620
[I sent my men
to investigate it right away.]

339
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,990
[It's true.]

340
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,700
[About a month ago,]

341
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,680

You pretended to work with Li Ruosheng

that at a time like this,

[He made up some excuses and rejected me.]

508
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:03,200
So I think

509
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,780
Mu Qing must have been taken away too.

510
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,690
These two incidents must be related.

511
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,140
I understand.

512
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,030
Have you located Mu Qing yet?

513
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,310
[Not yet.]

514
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,640
Okay, I'll figure it out.

515
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:16,140
I'll get back to you in ten minutes.

516
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:17,810
Please hurry.

517
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:48,700
Captain Rong.

518
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,500
Although Spectre is our highest priority,

519
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,010
but we can't risk our officers' lives

520
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,420
to achieve our goal.

521
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,040
So here's my suggestion.

522
00:27:56,130 --> 00:27:58,380
We should stop this right away.

523
00:27:58,460 --> 00:27:59,340
Stop this?

524
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:01,150
Won't that give our undercover agent away?

525
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,130
If things get out of hand,

526
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,360
not only will we be risking

527
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:05,330
the officer's life,

528
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,790
but our undercover agents' lives
will be at stake too.

529
00:28:08,010 --> 00:28:09,150
Mr. Bao is right.

530
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,610
We can't forcefully stop

531
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,060
this loyalty test.

532
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,690
We need to find another way.

533
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,850
Do you have any ideas?

534
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,540
NX042.

535
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:21,910
Five years ago,

536
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,760
in China's industrial weapons group,

537
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:27,280
a subordinate weapons development
department in Yungang

538
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,730
developed a batch

539
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,970
of non-lethal ammo.

540
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,610
The main component of the warhead

541
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:34,670
is a strong anesthetic.

542
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,740
Its outer layer is made of ingredients

543
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,630
that can easily dissolve in human bodies.

544
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,790
Its main purpose

545
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,550
is to ensure the bullet stops efficiently

546
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,740
and at the same time,

547
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,760
stun the target with the anesthetic.

548
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:52,630
This project's code name is NX042.

549
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,570
But its production is very expensive.

550
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,510
It wasn't mass-produced.

551
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,840
There was only a batch of samples

552
00:28:59,930 --> 00:29:01,430
that were distributed to the military

553
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:02,700
and Public Security Bureaus.

554
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:04,110
But coincidentally,

555
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,740
Yungang Municipal Public Security Bureau

556
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:07,280
was one of the test departments.

557
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,290
I did some research.

558
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:14,230
The caliber measurements

559
00:29:14,450 --> 00:29:17,880
are 5.56, 5.8, and 7.62.

560
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,130
And the 7.62 caliber

561
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,840
matches the caliber of Big Black Star,

562
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,820
a type of bullet commonly used
by drug dealers.

563
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:26,500
It's also known as Type 54.

564
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,630
Tell me about your plan.

565
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:31,960
My plan

566
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:34,030
might be a little risky.

567
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,550
I understand it's a risky plan.

568
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,880
But this is our only way.

569
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,990
Where are the bullets?

570
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,960
I'll go get them.

571
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:53,740
The caliber is on the envelope.
Look carefully.

572
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:54,750
Understood.

573
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,340
Attention, everyone.
Get ready to move out.

574
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,000
Hey, Kexin.

575
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:09,450
I was about to call you.

576
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,250
I can't reach Mu Qing.

577
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,190
Isn't he with Godfather?

578
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:14,550
Where are you?

579
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,140
I'm on my way to Glasses.

580
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,200
Send me your location.

581
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,660
Rong Yao, I just sent you the location.

582
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:58,900
Hello, Mr. Li.

583
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,660
Glasses's car just went up the mountain.

584
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:03,080
[The car with the traffic officer
is at the mountain now.]

585
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:04,180
Okay.

586
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,160
I hope they didn't find you out.

587
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,220
[I don't think so.]

588
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:08,850
Okay, keep following them.

589
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:09,810
I'm coming over now.

590
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,320
Mr. Glasses, everything is ready.

591
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,990
Get Mu Qing here.

592
00:31:58,650 --> 00:31:59,660
Later on,

593
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,040
if he doesn't kill him,

594
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:04,200
kill them both.

595
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:05,870
Yes.

596
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,120
Mr. Mu.

597
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,160
This way.

598
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,740
Mu Qing.

599
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,070
I called you out
in the middle of the night

600
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,490
because I need you to do something.

601
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:51,800
Kill this police officer.

602
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,090
This is what Mr. Ou wants.

603
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,680
Please don't blame me.

604
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:00,250
Mr. Glasses.

605
00:33:00,870 --> 00:33:03,290
Killing a police officer is a big deal.

606
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,410
Things are tough for the group
both inside and out.

607
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,910
Mr. Ou knows that too.

608
00:33:08,570 --> 00:33:10,370
Now, you want to get our hands stained

609
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,920
with the blood of this police officer?

610
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,530
To be honest,

611
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,600
Mr. Glasses, you should advise Mr. Ou

612
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:19,610
to think this through,

613
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,110
not use him against me.

614
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,750
You're right.

615
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,850
But...

616
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,970
we can only do as Mr. Ou says.

617
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,470
Please.

618
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:03,960
Mr. Glasses.

619
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,600
Have you done this before?

620
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,080
I've never done it before.

621
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:11,400
But...

622
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,250
you have to do it.

623
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:20,949
-Boss.
-Where are they?

624
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,960
They're up there.

625
00:34:22,179 --> 00:34:23,409
Here. Let's go this way.

626
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,560
This is your idea, isn't it?

627
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,050
Mu Qing.

628
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:32,600
I'll give you five seconds.

629
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,230
Either...

630
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,270
you shoot this police officer in the head,

631
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:38,630
or...

632
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:40,699
I'll shoot you in the head.

633
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:41,980
You choose.

634
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,199
Five.

635
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:48,090
Mr. Glasses.

636
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,070
Aren't you afraid

637
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,170
of getting shot for this?

638
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,449
Four.

639
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,070
Three.

640
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,510
Two.

641
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,700
Fine!

642
00:35:05,210 --> 00:35:06,130
I'll do it.

643
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,660
Captain Rong, do we shoot to stop them?

644
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,800
Don't be hasty.

645
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,030
Just wait.

646
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,220
Yes.

647
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:40,280
Glasses.

648
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,520
I want to see Mr. Ou. Now!

649
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,370
Mu Qing.

650
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,270
Do you know the consequences
of your actions?

651
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:54,090
I've always hated you.

652
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:56,330
But I didn't want to kill you.

653
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,310
But you...

654
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,220
colluded with Li Ruosheng and Ou Kexin

655
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:03,770
to plot against me and kill me.

656
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:05,840
Tell me.

657
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,080
How can I let you go?

658
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:10,720
Shoot!

659
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:13,980
What's wrong, Mr. Glasses?

660
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,770
Why are you making a lot of fuss?

661
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:21,060
Why are you here?

662
00:36:21,810 --> 00:36:23,130
If I hadn't come,

663
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:25,770
my friend would've died here.

664
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,030
This is what Mr. Ou wants.

665
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,580
He wants him to prove his loyalty.

666
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,510
Prove his loyalty?

667
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,510
What are you talking about?

668
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,850
If he shoots the police officer to death,

669
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42,180
that means he's one of us.

670
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,510
If he doesn't,

671
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,930
then he's a mole.

672
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,690
You still don't trust him, do you?

673
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:53,670
Okay.

674
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,690
If that's what Godfather wants...

675
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:58,420
Mu Qing.

676
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:00,270
Just do what Godfather says.

677
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,890
Mr. Glasses keeps suspecting

678
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,040
that you're the mole.

679
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:05,020
Prove to him that you are not.

680
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,790
Shoot him.

681
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,410
Shoot him!

682
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,550
She's finally here.

683
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:45,060
What?

684
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,340
-You mean she's...
-Yes.

685
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,720
She's our top secret.

686
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:58,120
What are you guys doing?

687
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,410
What's going on?

688
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,700
What are you people up to?

689
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,110
Kexin.

690
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:06,660
Step aside. It's none of your business.

691
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,290
I can go away.

692
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:09,560
But he's coming with me.

693
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,320
Mu Qing, let's go.

694
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:13,000
Stop right there.

695
00:38:21,490 --> 00:38:22,370
Kexin.

696
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,570
I just found out myself.

697
00:38:25,090 --> 00:38:26,280
Godfather is giving Mu Qing

698
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,340
a loyalty test today.

699
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,410
Once Mu Qing kills the police officer,

700
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,210
he will not be suspected

701
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:32,750
as a mole anymore.

702
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:35,130
Am I right, Mr. Glasses?

703
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,670
Mu Qing.

704
00:38:49,120 --> 00:38:50,220
You're not a mole.

705
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:53,030
You wouldn't do this to me.

706
00:39:09,710 --> 00:39:10,630
Kexin.

707
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,880
Let's see how he performs.

708
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,930
Glasses.

709
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,520
You don't trust me at all, do you?

710
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:43,320
Are you happy now?

711
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,260
He fired his gun

712
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,970
and the police officer is dead.

713
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:55,780
Is that enough?

714
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,270
This isn't over.

715
00:40:07,350 --> 00:40:08,270
Come on.

716
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,380
Bury the body.

717
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,210
You guys follow them.

718
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:44,530
Save him when you can.

719
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,500
Yes, sir.

720
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,500
How many secrets have you kept from me?

721
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:58,830
It is not my secret either.

722
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,450
It's a mission.

723
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:07,760
Your idea was good.

724
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,650
It was nicely executed.

725
00:41:11,450 --> 00:41:12,510
Let's get out of here.

726
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,480
["The Place Farthest Away" playing]

727
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,190
♫ Against the light ♫

728
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:40,710
♫ Your vague silhouette ♫

729
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,180
♫ I reach out with my hands ♫

730
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:46,520
♫ But my hug passes through you ♫

731
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:50,570
♫ Maybe this is an illusion ♫

732
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:52,510
♫ A sweet dream ♫

733
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,150
♫ Waiting for you ♫

734
00:41:55,230 --> 00:41:58,840
♫ To notice it and wake me up ♫

735
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,220
♫ I wonder if getting close to you ♫

736
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,950
♫ One swirl will light up the stars ♫

737
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:10,500
♫ I wonder if someone
will tell you for me ♫

738
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,570
♫ At the place farthest away ♫

739
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,870
♫ Only then will the kites roam freely ♫

740
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:22,200
♫ If I gaze relentlessly ♫

741
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:25,370
♫ I wonder if there will be starlight ♫

742
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:28,410
♫ If the falling fireworks ♫

743
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:31,840
♫ Give me the sadness of being lonely ♫

744
00:42:31,930 --> 00:42:34,130
♫ If your gaze gives me ♫

745
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,420
♫ A sense of direction ♫

746
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:40,990
♫ I'll give you an answer too ♫

747
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:55,290
♫ Looking at your turbulent silence ♫

748
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:01,060
♫ I really hope you can understand ♫

749
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:07,790
♫ So I remain extremely quiet and gentle ♫

750
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:13,900
♫ Waiting for you to kiss my forehead ♫

751
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,060
♫ It seems you're in front of me ♫

752
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:19,100
♫ Like the four seasons in my heart ♫

753
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,090
♫ Gentle and heart-wrenching ♫

754
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:25,430
♫ What can I say? ♫

755
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:28,290
♫ At the place farthest away ♫

756
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:31,720
♫ Only then will the kites roam freely ♫

757
00:43:31,810 --> 00:43:34,050
♫ If I gaze relentlessly ♫

758
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:37,440
♫ I wonder if there will be starlight ♫

759
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:40,430
♫ Standing on your spot ♫

760
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,820
♫ Only then will I forget
the faraway place ♫

761
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:45,010
♫ Only your gaze ♫

762
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:48,490
♫ Can give me acknowledgment ♫

763
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:54,730
♫ Can give me an answer ♫
