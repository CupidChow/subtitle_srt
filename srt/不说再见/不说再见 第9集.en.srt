3
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:36,620
Even if it's beyond this turf,

4
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,830
it depends on whether you're qualified.

5
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,610
What are you saying?

6
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,720
Mr. Dafeng.

7
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:48,450
Don't you want the money
that's in front of you?

8
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,410
There is money that I can take,

9
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,330
but there is money that is scalding.

10
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,100
Hang on, why are they still inside?

11
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,780
Did something happen?

12
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,470
Do you know Glasses and Tieguanyin?

13
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:16,829
Yes.

14
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,690
But I don't care

15
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,540
and I don't need to know

16
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,079
the connections they have.

17
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:25,460
A nobody like you

18
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,610
doesn't deserve to talk to me.

19
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,970
Wearing glasses?

20
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,040
It seems you're blind!

21
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,030
How dare you bring everyone to me?

22
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,880
I want you to fix the car.

23
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,460
I didn't tell you to sell it!

24
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:41,520
Yes.

25
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,579
I didn’t expect a big organization

26
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,550
like Group K

27
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,880
would look down on others so much.

28
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,050
Dakun.

29
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,560
Don't be underestimated.

30
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:57,970
Do you think this move will work on me?

31
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:02,860
Hey, man.

32
00:03:04,570 --> 00:03:06,990
There are some things
that I can't help you with.

33
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,280
If you really want to say something,

34
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,770
you shouldn't say...

35
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,590
After you have two holes in your body,

36
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,620
I'm afraid you won't be able
to say anything.

37
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,910
Are you threatening me?

38
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,630
It's a true story.

39
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,890
No, let's go inside.

40
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,530
Captain Rong, he's out!

41
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:01,900
Come on.

42
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:04,670
Don't hug me.

43
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,990
It's okay. Just hang in there.

44
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:10,660
I'll deal with you later.

45
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:15,590
-Good job.
-Of course.

46
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,630
Unfiltered liquor?

47
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:31,950
As much as you want.

00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,960
Sir.

78
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,900
Why don't we wipe them out?

79
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,440
No.

80
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,760
Let's investigate first.

81
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:03,160
Take down the ones that belong

82
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,130
to Xiaofoye.

83
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,200
-Don't touch anything else.
-Why?

84
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,050
It's a good chance
to catch them all at once.

85
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,240
"All at once"?

86
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,690
We're only getting shrimps,

87
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,880
not the big fish.

88
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,810
But if we can find a way

89
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,750
to set up a rift between the big shots,

90
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,860
isn't that great?

91
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,680
Here comes the fish.

92
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:26,790
The food is all here.

93
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,050
Mr. Ou, look.

94
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,200
It's just a get-together of brothers.

95
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,830
We can just drink and talk.

96
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,909
You don't have to put so much effort
into cooking for us.

97
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,980
I just cooked one meal.

98
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,470
Compared to you guys,

99
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,620
it's no effort at all.

100
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:43,470
Am I right? Here.

101
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:44,830
Cheers to all of you.

102
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,060
Thank you for your hard work.

103
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,310
To Mr. Ou.

104
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:49,670
Okay.

105
00:06:57,590 --> 00:06:59,480
-You haven't had fish in a while, right?
-Yes.

106
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,430
Speaking of fish,

107
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,730
do you know there's a system
in a fishing pond?

108
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,250
Goldfish like to stay in the shallows.

109
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:11,450
Sharpbelly like to stay on the water.

110
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,470
The grass carps stay

111
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,060
in the middle and lower levels.

112
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,390
Catfish are at the bottom.

113
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,720
Do you know what this is?

114
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,020
A clear division of territories.

115
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,710
That's for the fish.

116
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,200
But what about people?

117
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:28,700
As for people,

118
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:30,330
we're able to work together

119
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,890
because of a clear division of labor.

120
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,230
That's why the pond is peaceful.

121
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,010
Otherwise, if the fish get all worked up,

122
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,250
they would be revealing their locations

123
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,540
to the anglers on the shore.

124
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:45,950
Dakun.

125
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,710
Am I right?

126
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,730
You're right.

127
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,780
So,

128
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,980
I gave a name

129
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,650
to this fish today.

130
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,940
"Peace is the most important thing."

131
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,260
I hope from now on,

132
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:03,020
once everyone has tasted the fish,

133
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,860
you guys can be like its name.

134
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,360
Live in harmony.

135
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,160
Harmony brings wealth.

136
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,260
Godfather, you are right.

137
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,560
There's even a name for a fish.

138
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,320
-Of course.
-My dad is so talented.

139
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,650
After we finish the meal,
let's try some clothes.

140
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,070
Right. Let's eat.

141
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,740
Let's look at her craftsmanship later.

142
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,150
Glasses.

143
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,130
Xiaofoye's factories were raided.

144
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,260
When was that?

145
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,490
Just now.

146
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,680
What happened?

147
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,740
During Operation Thunderbolt,

148
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,650
we cracked a total

149
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,230
of 17 drug stashes

150
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,040
and 6 drug transfer locations.

151
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:10,250
We also seized more than 200kg of drugs

152
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,490
and more than 4 million drug money.

153
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,430

It's Xiaofoye's.

165

All 17 of them?

166
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,310
Yes.

167

00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:02,650
that your delivery route is watertight.

172
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:06,430
Of all people, you have the mole.

173
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,680
What were you doing?

174
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,480
Mr. Ou.

175
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:13,340
It was an accident.

176
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:17,210
Let me explain it slowly.

177
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:28,040
Mr. Ou, we'll leave now.

178
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,530
Godfather.

179
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,550
Mr. Ou.

180
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,130
Come here.

181
00:10:58,220 --> 00:10:59,370
Come here.

182
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,600
Hurry up.

183
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:02,270
You two had better make it clear.

184
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,630
What exactly happened?

185
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,740
You didn't even eat properly.

186
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,060
It's okay.

187
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,780
It's just a business problem.

188
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,230
Is it serious?

189
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,040
Ms. Ou.

190
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,580
Mr. Ou has instructed us.

191
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,200
Don't ask anything

192
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,350
about our business.

193
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,920
I'm just concerned about my dad's health.

194
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,510
What if something happens to him?

195
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,050
It's not worth it.

196
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,070
So? Tell me.

197
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,080
I have a bad feeling about this.

198
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,440
What do you mean?

199
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,760
Someone suddenly starts

200
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:35,050
to worry about her dad's health.

201
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:36,500
Are you for real?

202
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,520
What do you mean?

203
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:40,770
Isn't he my dad? Can't I care about him?

204
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,660
I think you're worried

205
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,420
about the money on your card.

206
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,870
Am I right?

207
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,820
Tell me, Mu Qing.

208
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,120
I...

209
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,620
I don't know.

210
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:56,560
Both of you...

211
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,920
This is for not telling me.

212
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,430
Both of you are saying, "I don't know."

213
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,620
I was wrong.

214
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,900
I was wrong.

215
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,730
Mr. Ou.

216
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,050
Punish me.

217
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,810
It was my mistake.

218
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,660
There will be no next time.

219
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:24,020
You've been with me for years.

220
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,140
I trust your skills.

221
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,120
Since you admitted your mistake,

222
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,490
then I'll give you some time.

223
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,300
Think about

224
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,670
how I should punish you.

225
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:42,190
-Glasses.
-Yes.

226
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,550
Get me Kexin.

227
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:45,670
I want to try the clothes she made.

228
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:48,090
I don't want to hear any of this crap.

229
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,450
It's bad luck.

230
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,640
Mr. Ou.

231
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:06,350
[Natural order]

232
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,840
Did you really make this?

233
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,030
Of course.

234
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:17,700
I designed it myself.

235
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:19,590
I even picked out the fabric myself.

236
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,040
Of course.

237
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,200
I had some help with the tailoring.

238
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,250
But Dad,

239
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:26,590
you're already getting
the most special treatment.

240
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,080
Let me try it on.

241
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,090
Okay.

242
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,310
What do you think?

243
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,570
Low-key but with substance.

244
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,120
Cool and composed.

245
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,320
Is that so?

246
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:46,520
Is it nice?

247
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,760
You have style, elegance, and panache.

248
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,570
Kexin's craftsmanship is extraordinary.

249
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,080
-As the saying goes,
-Say something.

250
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,150
"A daughter is the apple
of a father's eye."

251
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,640
Am I right?

252
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:01,920
Yes, sir.

253
00:14:02,450 --> 00:14:03,330
Dad.

254
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,690
It's not only a thoughtful gift,

255
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,630
but it also fits you so well.

256
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,640
Look.

257
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,310
Isn't it perfect?

258
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,300
You're so handsome.

259
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:21,280
Glasses, have you noticed

260
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,780
that recently, Mr. Ou

261
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:26,030
treated Kexin way better than before.

262
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,360
A while ago,

263
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,080
he insisted on sending Kexin away.

264
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,760
Look at how precious she is to him now.

265
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,460
She is his daughter after all.

266
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:39,100
Honestly speaking,

267
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,040
if it weren't for Kexin,

268
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,110
with Mr. Ou's temper in the past,

269
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,180
I wouldn't be able to cross this hurdle.

270
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,780
Dakun.

271
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,890
You should know

272
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,470
the way Mr. Ou does things.

273
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,900
He only gives second chances,
not third chances.

274
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,440
You've caused enough trouble lately.

275
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,500
Be careful.

276
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:06,380
Maybe Mr. Ou won't be so angry anymore.

277
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,100
He's not mad, but I'm mad.

278
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,010
Just those two darn kids.

279
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,130
How dare they rule over me?

280
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,110
There's no way I can't touch them.

281
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,440
Hang in there.

282
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,350
Do you want both of them to have

283
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,760
a good laugh at you?

284
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,570
Dakun.

285
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,240
I don't want to scold you.

286
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,000
You're fine.

287
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,540
But sometimes,

288
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,920
you're an airhead.

289
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,370
What are you saying?

290
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:37,700
Ou Kexin is Mr. Ou's precious daughter.

291
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,520
Whoever gets close to her

292
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,730
will obtain a life-saving amulet.

293
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:48,170
Think about it.

294
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:53,810
Mr. Glasses. Mr. Dakun.

295
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,650
You're still here.

296
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:57,720
Okay. I'll let you two talk.

297
00:15:57,810 --> 00:15:59,530
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

298
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,990
It's too late to talk about anything.

299
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,060
-Let's go.
-Kexin.

300
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:07,180
I have something to tell you.

301
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,210
Tell me then.

302
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,460
Maybe next time.

303
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,610
Mr. Dakun.

304
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:14,790
We're all family.

305
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,980
What do you want to say?

306
00:16:16,690 --> 00:16:17,830
Tell me.

307
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,160
Actually,

308
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,530
it's nothing.

309
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:23,020
I want to ask you.

310
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,220
Have you already set up your warehouse?

311
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,030
Speaking of which,

312
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,570
you're so nice.

313
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:29,970
Thank you, Mr. Dakun.

314
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,380
It's no trouble at all.

315
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,670
We're close after all.

316
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:35,080
No trouble at all?

317
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,180
Don't be shy.

318
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:37,760
I won't hold back then.

319
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,830
Didn't my boutique just open?

320
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,800
How about this?

321
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,380
Bring some men with you

322
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:43,750
to my shop in a few days.

323
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,550
Take it as giving me a lucky break.

324
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,650
What do you think?

325
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:47,790
Just this?

326
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:49,730
It's a piece of cake.

327
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,530
I'm worried that the stuff you have

328
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,680
won't be enough.

329
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:54,920
I'd love for you to move everything out.

330
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:56,510
-It's a deal.
-Yes.

331
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,130
-I'm off.
-I'll be waiting.

332
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,100
See you.

333
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,550
-Bye.
-Bye.

334
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,650
Mr. Dakun.

335
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,020
Bye, Mr. Dakun.

336
00:17:06,630 --> 00:17:08,079
Dakun's flattery

337
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,589
cannot be more obvious.

338
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,079
Do you have that much stuff?

339
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,359
You can't just say yes.

340
00:17:13,450 --> 00:17:14,550
Are you stupid?

341
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,950

How many forehead lines do I have?

00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:26,480
I'm done.

515
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,460
Dakun.

516
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,660
Gosh, you and your temper.

517
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,780
It's such a nice lighter.

518
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,320
Don't dent it.

519
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,540
Stop the car.

520
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,990
What's the matter, sir?

521
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,480
I need to pee.

522
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:25,880
Do you know the consequences
of being a mole?

523
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,170
Mr. Dakun, I've been with you for years.

524
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,360
I'm really not the mole.

525
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,070
You're not the mole.

526
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:34,110
If this car wasn't bugged,

527
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,180
can the police raid my nest?

528
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,760
I don't know anything about bugs.

529
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,450
I'm just asking.

530
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,950
Look at how startled you are.

531
00:28:54,090 --> 00:28:55,580
How can you work for me?

532
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:58,530
Our car.

533
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,350
Who else touched it besides you and me?

534
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:03,150
At the repair shop that day,

535
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,130
a girl touched your car.

536
00:29:05,570 --> 00:29:07,680
Before that,
Li Ruosheng and Mu Qing touched it too.

537
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,250
Why is your phone turned off?

538
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,920
Hurry up. We have a situation.

539
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,130
"Brethren.

540
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,070
About our past disagreements,

541
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:43,190
now that I think about it,

542
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,650
we're one big family.

543
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,900
What's mine is thine
and what's thine is mine.

544
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:51,370
My man had crossed the line.

545
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:53,220
He was wrong.

546
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,830
I beg ye to oblige me.

547
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,910
Let me apologize to ye in person.

548
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,370
This afternoon,

549
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,400
please come to the revolving restaurant

550
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,860
on the 28th floor of Sunshine Plaza.

551
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,400
Dakun."

552
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,000
Did he time travel from ancient times?

553
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,710
Why can't he talk properly?

554
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,600
Isn't this like the Hongmen Banquet?

555
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,600
I don't know.

556
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,660
Are you going or not?

557
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,130
He's so sincere.

558
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,540
It's not proper if we don't go.

559
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,080
Let's go then.

560
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,440
Should we take a few men?

561
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,450
That's not necessary.

562
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,300
In my opinion,

563
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,020
he can't be that bold.

564
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,490
I'll go home and get changed.

565
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,600
Go.

566
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,820
You're just in time.

567
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,890
That type of food isn't good for you.

568
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,170
Come here.

569
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,790
Sit down.

570
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,990
What are you doing?

571
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,190
Breakfast.

572
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,520
Breakfast?

573
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,780
Is this some kind of dark cuisine?

574
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:07,800
I can't believe you do workouts.

575
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,470
Don't you know that after a workout,

576
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,700
the breakfast must be

577
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,950
balanced and rich in nutrition?

578
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,580
You also need protein.

579
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,510
That's why I grilled a steak for you.

580
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,540
How is it? Are you satisfied?

581
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,560
I won't get poisoned, right?

582
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,630
If I want to poison you,

583
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,180
do I need to go through all this trouble?

584
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:26,760
A glass of milk is enough.

585
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,050
You don't trust me?

586
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,200
Okay.

587
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,340
I'm okay.

588
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:37,500
Do you still doubt me?

589
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,890
How is it? Is it good?

590
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,210
I'm doing this to thank you.

591
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,710
Yet you accuse me of poisoning you.

592
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,760
Why are you suddenly so understanding?

593
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:02,800
Before I move out,

594
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:05,570
consider it a reward.

595
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:06,980
Are you moving out?

596
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:09,180
I'm always at your place.

597
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:10,890
You look uncomfortable too.

598
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:13,620
I can live on the second floor
of my studio, right?

599
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:14,720
That way,

600
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,970
I can live and work at the same time.

601
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:18,460
Isn't it nice?

602
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,310
I didn't expect it.

603
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,940
You're ready to do well

604
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:23,350
and become a career woman?

605
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,150
Whom are you going to show it to?

606
00:32:25,330 --> 00:32:26,340
You.

607
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:28,890
Who else?

608
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,940
Kexin.

609
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,650
Don't joke about that.

610
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,320
I'm serious.

611
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,680
Take a good look.

612
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:42,440
Is my whole body

613
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:44,770
exuding the aura of a career woman?

614
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:50,360
Look at me.

615
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:01,320
-You should eat too.
-Okay.

616
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,010
Let me take you home.

617
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,380
No, I don't have much stuff

618
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,780
so I asked someone to move it.

619
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:20,190
That's good.

620
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,450
I have some here.

621
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:29,870
Eat it.

622
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:31,850
Kexin.

623
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,150
That's right.

624
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,160
This darn cell phone signal.

625
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:49,060
I'd just move out because of this.

626
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,320
What are you doing? Dawdling?

627
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,330
Were you doing makeup?

628
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,690
I've been waiting for you.

629
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,670
Ou Kexin made me breakfast.

630
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,950
I had to eat it.

631
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,440
What?

632
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,080
Kexin made you breakfast.

633
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:07,320
What's the reason?

634
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:09,250
She's moving in immediately

635
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,260
into her studio.

636
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:12,510
It's to thank me
for taking care of her all this time.

637
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,090
That's why she made breakfast.

638
00:34:14,750 --> 00:34:15,679
When is she moving out?

639
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,170
It should be soon.

640
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,929
She even hired a moving company.

641
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,330
That's a relief.

642
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,489
Why is it a relief?

643
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:27,730
Firstly.

644
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:30,460
Kexin won't pester you now.

645
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:32,440
Can you give our business

646
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,760
your full attention now?

647
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,120
Secondly.

648
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,199
My godfather may not object
to me going after her.

649
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:40,710
And you don't want to be a prince consort.

650
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,120
I won't hold back then.

651
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,030
When can you use your sneaky ideas

652
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,130
on the right path?

653
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,030
This is the best way to achieve success

654
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:49,989
on the right path.

655
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,090
Second to none.

656
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:54,880
What's that face?

657
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,270
Do you oppose? Unwilling? Reluctant?

658
00:34:58,350 --> 00:34:59,670
Who opposes? Who's unwilling?

659
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,640
Who's reluctant?

660
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,140
Just drive.

661
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:03,280
Let's go. We're late.

662
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,290
You said it.

663
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,360
I looked into your eyes.

664
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,150
I made up my mind promptly.

665
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,130
I threw one punch.

666
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:24,970
Then the blood suddenly...

667
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,880
I said, "Don't try to fool me."

668
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:29,420
"Where are the goods?"

669
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,790
-Guess what?
-What?

670
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,380
He trembled

671
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:35,970
and then took off his pants.

672
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,290
Why did he do that?

673
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,930
Don't you understand yet?

674
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,430
He said, "Sir.

675
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,010
The goods are here."

676
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:46,710
I've seen a cock my whole life.

677
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,390
This is the first time
a cock looked at me.

678
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,620
He pulled out such a long string of goods.

679
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,080
If one of them breaks,

680
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:57,620
I would've killed him.

681
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,660
When I think about back then,

682
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:03,470
I risked my life every day.

683
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,970
That was how we did business.

684
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,550
The success we have today

685
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:08,230
didn't come easily.

686
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,560
Unlike now.

687
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,790
Sit in front of the computer,

688
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,030
type on the keyboard, dial your phone,

689
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:16,150
and the biggest deal can be done.

690
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,750
It's the youngsters' world now.

691
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:22,300
Don't say that.

692
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,150
Without a senior like you

693
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,470
who went through peril,

694
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:28,020
we would never catch up
to such a good time.

695
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,530
As your junior, cheers to you.

696
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:31,980
Come on.

697
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,320
With this glass,

698
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,900
take it as an apology

699
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,700
for that disappointing Xiaofoye.

700
00:36:37,790 --> 00:36:39,550
Let bygones be bygones.

701
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,830
Let's move on

702
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,320
and work together from now on.

703
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,740
Dakun.

704
00:36:44,830 --> 00:36:47,300
You're apologizing on behalf of Xiaofoye?

705
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,540
Does that mean

706
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:52,220
this is all Xiaofoye's fault?

707
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,760
It's all in the past.

708
00:36:53,850 --> 00:36:55,130
Why mention Xiaofoye?

709
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,640
Dakun humbled himself today

710
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,700
to give us such a good apology.

711
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:00,940
What else do you want?

712
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:04,320
Dakun.

713
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,620
I'm too young to know better.

714
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,100
Thank you for thinking so highly of us.

715
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:12,730
Thank you.

716
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,700
Have a seat.

717
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,100
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

718
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:17,000
-Thank you.
-You're welcome. Have a seat.

719
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,450
Whatever happened in the past

720
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,680
is in the past now.

721
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:20,690
From now on,

722
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,970
let's work together.

723
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,600
That's a promise, Dakun.

724
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,360
Speaking of which,

725
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,910
let's talk business.

726
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,410
All right. Let's talk business.

727
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:35,920
Boys.

728
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,190
I got

729
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:39,660
a new shipment recently.

730
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,340
It's uncut and pure.

731
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:47,530
Take it as my apology to you two.

732
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,850
What do you think?

733
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,930
Just one batch?

734
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:54,130
As you know,

735
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,510
-the sales of Jinhua Street are really...
-All right.

736
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,090
Three batches.

737
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:01,210
Dakun, you're so generous.

738
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,510
My friend here almost died.

739
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:05,970
Okay.

740
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,960
Five batches, that's all.

741
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,100
Sure, Dakun.

742
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:11,730
Five batches it is.

743
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,180
From now on,

744
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:15,120
we're loyal to you.

745
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:16,390
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

746
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,360
Thank you, Dakun!

747
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,330
Cheers.

748
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,740
Drink up.

749
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,870
Here, have some food.

750
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,680
All these dishes are expensive.

751
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,490
Mu Qing, eat more.

752
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,670
Don't waste it.

753
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,580
Thank you, Dakun.

754
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:36,850
Don't mention it.

755
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,400
"Dakun.

756
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,500
From now on,

757
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:45,920
we're loyal to you."

758
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,630
Are you copying me?

759
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,820
Mu Qing, you're something.

760
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,800
I didn't realize it before.

761
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:52,080
With your acting skills,

762
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,410
I think it's a waste
that you're in this business.

763
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,520
Dakun is better at acting than me.

764
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:57,800
Why don't you talk about him?

765
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:58,810
Stop making fun of me.

766
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,350
He's a stand-up comedian.

767
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,580
Does that even compare?

768
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,130
Tell me.

769
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,810
Dakun is such a stingy person.

770
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,870
He spent so much money on us.

771
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:10,730
It's not just for business, right?

772
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:12,850
Did you realize that too?

773
00:39:12,930 --> 00:39:15,310
I'm not an idiot. I can tell.

774
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,820
Is this a business?

775
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:18,790
We'll see about that.

776
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,060
Let's wait and see.

777
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:25,210
Having a meal with Dakun

778
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,400
wasted so much of my time.

779
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:27,940
All right, I'm leaving.

780
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,300
Wait a minute.

781
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:30,490
Where are you going?

782
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,510
It's a personal matter.

783
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,240
"Personal matter"?

784
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,410
[Custom-tailored]

785
00:39:59,090 --> 00:39:59,970
This color.

786
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,940
Okay.

787
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:02,080
And this.

788
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,720
And number eight.

789
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,040
-Take them.
-Okay.

790
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:10,880
Kexin.

791
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,090
Are you busy?

792
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,590
Why are you here?

793
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,860
Did you come alone?

794
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,620
Where's Mu Qing?

795
00:40:18,890 --> 00:40:20,210
Can't I come here alone?

796
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,300
Here, open it.

797
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,620
Rainbow swiss rolls.

798
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:31,120
How did you know?

799
00:40:31,210 --> 00:40:33,060
I read an interview you did online.

800
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,110
I knew you liked this

801
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,300
when you were in France.

802
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,680
I searched the entire Yungang

803
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,130
to find the most authentic one.

804
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,930
Coincidentally, this is the last piece.

805
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:42,300
Someone else booked it.

806
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,670
I tried to persuade them for so long.

807
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,300
They finally gave it to me.

808
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:47,490
Don't thank me.

809
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:50,000
Tell me. What is it?

810
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:53,690
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

811
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,220
I just want to...

812
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,380
I want to thank you.

813
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:05,570
Out of good faith,

814
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,760
you saved my buddy

815
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:08,610
from the hands of Laoba the Butcher.

816
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:09,660
That's all.

817
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,990
-Thank me?
-Yes.

818
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:15,250
A life in exchange for a cake.

819
00:41:15,470 --> 00:41:16,660
Sure.

820
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,370
Besides, if you guys are thankful,

821
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,090
why can't he thank me himself?

822
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:21,320
Did he send you?

823
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:22,820
Sort of.

824
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,140
"Sort of"?

825
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,770
Is that a yes or no?

826
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,390
Yes.

827
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:30,300
I'm here to ask you something.

828
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:31,970
How can you just move out?

829
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,350
What? Can't I?

830
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:35,710
Do you have a problem with that?

831
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,990
I have no objections.

832
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,660
I think he does.

854
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:45,950
♫ And time is my love confession ♫

855
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:49,380
♫ If love ever comes ♫

856
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:52,900
♫ It's the sweetest thing
I look forward to ♫

857
00:43:52,990 --> 00:43:56,160
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

858
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,540
♫ Say goodbye ♫

859
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:04,870
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

860
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:09,530
♫ Say goodbye ♫
