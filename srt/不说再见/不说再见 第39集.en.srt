[Episode 39]

3
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,660
He knows we don't have time.

4
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:38,950
But he told me to learn everything.

5
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,470
-How so?
-Those little tricks are the point.

6
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,030
Those methamphetamine makers

7
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,920
do it mostly in the same way.

8
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,900
But their tricks are not the same.

9
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:52,060
But these tricks
are what make them different.

10
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,610
You can tell if they're professionals

11
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,060
or some nerds

12
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:57,600
trying to make money in a lab.

13
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,500
What's the difference?

14
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,170
It's a huge difference.

15
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:03,370
Take your time.

16
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,730
I have prepared these for you.

17
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,830
Try them on.

18
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,560
The clothes I prepared aren't good enough.

19
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,660
I've been thinking.

20
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,860
As a famous cook,

21
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,790
shouldn't you wear something unique?

22
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:16,350
You're almost a stylist now.

23
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,579
I learned it from you.

24
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,480
These shoes are nice.

25
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:22,020
-Try it.
-All right.

26
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,380
So you're Mr. Glasses.

27
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,900
Mr. Mu told me everything.

28
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,450
As long as you offer the right amount,

29
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,910
I'll do it for you.

30
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,530
Please take off your glasses.

31
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:53,750
Why?

32
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,640
You look familiar.

33
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,790
Like an old friend of mine.

34
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,150
Why?

35
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:04,570
Is it inconvenient?

36
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,440
Do I look like your friend?

37
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:28,200
Mu Qing, come with me.

38
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,380
You said you could find
a first-class chef.

39
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,310
It's just this one person.

40
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,610
This guy is Wen Ran.

41
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,240
He joined the industry at 16.

42
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:51,470
When he was in prison,

43
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,450
he learned some wicked tricks
from his master.

44
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,730
His stir-fried pork

45
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:56,660
can reach 90% purity.

46
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,250
Is it 90%?

47
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,960
That's low.

48
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:01,020
If you add extra,

49
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,470
it won't be that pure.

50
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,620
This level of purity

51
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,710
is perfectly enough

52
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,900
to deal with the junkies.

53
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,190
So you're saying

54
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:10,870
he didn't come out of a lab.

55
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,510
They aren't usable at all.

56
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:15,890
They need money. They want quick cash.

57
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,519
They won't stay for long.

58
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,040
Wen Ran is different.

59
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:23,330
He makes a living by stir-frying pork.

60
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,040
Whom did he follow before?

61
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,770
Mr. Peng from Guangxi.

62
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,500
Three years ago,
they swept drugs at the border.

63
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:31,990
Mr. Peng died.

64
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,930
He was lucky enough to stay alive.

65
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,700
How do you know him?

66
00:04:37,409 --> 00:04:38,510
When I was in Yunnan,

67
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:39,740
he lived next door.

68
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,130
What a coincidence.

69
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,020
Mr. Glasses.

70
00:04:45,110 --> 00:04:46,600
Look into it if you don't believe me.

71
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,030
That's not the issue right now.

72
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:52,060
He is good with his hands.

73
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,909
We really don't have much time.

74
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,310
If Mr. Ou knows

75
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,550
about our factory's issue,

76
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,830
then we're in trouble.

77
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,040
Hey.

78
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:07,940
Mr. Glasses, Mr. Mu.

79
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,100
Are you two okay?

80
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,740
Do you want me? Say something.

81
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,160
I want heavy metal.

82
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:24,840
Heavy metal?

83
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,960
Heavy metal.

84
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,380
Play it.

85
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,670
Is he okay?

86
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,580
Mr. Glasses.

87
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,470
Let's see how it goes.

88
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,530
Don't you need a test?

89
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:48,390
[80% purity]

90
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,540
We agreed on 90%.

91
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:59,610
Where is your promised 90%?

92
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:07,480
Let's go.

93
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,510
[93% purity]

94
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:21,740
Wait!

95
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,010
Mr. Glasses.

96
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,750
[93% purity]

97
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,590
Good job.

98
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,920
Heavy metal.

99
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,860
You did it.

100
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,240
Shao Nan.

101
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,390
Get him a nice suite.

102
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,620
Arrange two girls

103
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,210
to treat him well.

104
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:14,410
I don't need the girls. I don't like it.

105
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,340
The suite sounds good.

106
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:17,350
Besides,

107
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,670
I want

108
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,300
beluga caviar.

109
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,460
Beluga caviar?

110
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,260
Not a problem.

111
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:26,510
Mu Qing.

112
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,530
I owe you one.

113
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,250
Thank you.

114
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,669
Mr. Glasses.

115
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:34,340
No matter what we do,

116
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:36,049
it's all for the good of the company.

117
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:03,160
[93% purity]

118
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,480
Hello?

119
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:05,840
Mr. Ou.

120
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,730
It's me, Zhou Changhao.

121
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,800
Mr. Zhou.

122
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,250
Hello.

123
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,020
Are you having fun in Yungang?

124
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:15,480
I'm at Yunmen Plaza.

125
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,150
In two hours,

126
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,560
send someone to pick me up.

127
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,710
Okay, I'll arrange it.

128
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,470
Yes, sir.

129
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:30,960
I'm on my way.

130
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,240
Wen Ran.

131
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,170
Get off up there.

132
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,940
I'll have my guys take you to a hotel.

133
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:45,620
You won't eat caviar with me anymore?

134
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,220
I'll join you when I'm done.

135
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,860
All right.

136
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,230
Since you're busy,

137
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,030
I'll go back to the hotel myself.

138
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,190
I don't need your men to accompany me.

139
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,390
If you're working with me,

140
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,320
do as I say.

141
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,440
Okay.

142
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,670
Park on the side.

143
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,790
Thank you, Mr. Glasses.

144
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,770
Please get in.

145
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,940
I already know the secret code
to contact Zhao Ran.

146
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,170
What about the location?

147
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:56,720
From now on,

148
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:59,010
we have our insider with Glasses.

149
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:02,090
But you sent him.

150
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:04,640
Glasses will suspect him for sure.

151
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,620
If we were to find Spectre's man,

152
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:08,030
we can't rely solely on Zhao Ran.

153
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,590
I'll contact Zhao Ran.

154
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,070
What is this?

155
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,040
It's okay.

156
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,240
It's probably stained
with some chemical ingredients.

157
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:24,700
I see. Take it off.

158
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,200
I'll take this to the cleaners.

159
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:28,000
It's okay. I'll get changed on my own.

160
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:30,600
What do you mean?

161
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,580
This is my gift to you.

162
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,900
How could you just change it?

163
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,820
Take it off.

164
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,790
Come on.

165
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,460
Kexin.

166
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,920
Is Kexin here?

167
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:55,900
Dad.

168
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,480
What are you doing here?

169
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,330
Both of you are here.

170
00:11:59,810 --> 00:12:01,000
Chat with me.

171
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:03,600
Okay.

172
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,090
Let's talk upstairs.

173
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,060
Okay.

174
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,490
Dad, have some tea.

175
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:17,670
Okay.

176
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,130
This place is okay, right?

177
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,360
It's good.

178
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,790
Why are you here?

179
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,460
And you didn't even call.

180
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:26,780
What if I wasn't here?

181
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,500
I just miss you.

182
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:29,860
So I came to see you.

183
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:31,360
Of course Mu Qing too.

184
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:32,940
Mu Qing?

185
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,830
You work with him.

186
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,420
Don't you see him every day?

187
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:37,520
It's different.

188
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:39,280
The Mu Qing I usually see

189
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,550
is the one who works for me.

190
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:42,310
The Mu Qing I see today

191
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,030
is my daughter's boyfriend.

192
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,130
That's not the same.

193
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,450
Dad.

194
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,340
Are you okay?

195
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,940
That doesn't sound like you.

196
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:53,530
Are you acknowledging Mu Qing?

197
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:54,850
Look.

198
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,510
Both of you have been through so much.

199
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,060
Mu Qing has always been by your side.

200
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,160
It's not easy.

201
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,830
As her dad,

202
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:06,030
I have nothing to worry about.

203
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,830
From now on,

204
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,590
my daughter's heart

205
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,910
has no place for me.

206
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:13,290
Dad, that's not true.

207
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,360
Even if I'm with Mu Qing,

208
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,760
I'm still your daughter.

209
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:18,570
We won't leave you.

210
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,470
All right.

211
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,640
Let's settle this then.

212
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:25,960
Mu Qing.

213
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,080
Will you always take care of my daughter?

214
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,840
Dad.

215
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:33,480
Are you asking us to...

216
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,020
I'm asking Mu Qing.

217
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,150
I'd love to, sir.

218
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,260
That's great.

219
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,960
This is your flight ticket in three days.

220
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:49,590
Pack things up.

221
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,170
Go abroad for your honeymoon.

222
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,150
It will last for a year or so.

223
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,960
Find the right place abroad

224
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,190
and settle down.

225
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:57,600
Don't ever come back.

226
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,930
Dad.

227
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,910
Why did you give us your blessing

228
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,980
and kick us out?

229
00:14:08,990 --> 00:14:10,440
I'm not kicking you out.

230
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,350
I chose a life that suits you.

231
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,060
Mu Qing.

232
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,560
Use those three days.

233
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:19,150
Hand over the dark web
trading system to Ruosheng.

234
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,470
From now on,

235
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,880
you're my son-in-law,

236
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,640
my daughter's shield.

237
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,360
No matter where my daughter is,

238
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:26,630
you must be there.

239
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:28,750
Do you understand?

240
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,060
Yes, sir.

241
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:34,730
Dad.

242
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,050
Do you have any other questions?

243
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:41,950
That's all.

244
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,060
Don't disappoint me.

245
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:57,740
You don't have much time. Pack up.

246
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:59,060
Remember what I said.

247
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,570
I'm leaving.

248
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,070
What should we do now?

249
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:24,930
We still have a chance.

250
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,530
We don't have time.

251
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,300
We still have three days.

252
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,900
Trust me.

253
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,060
Hello?

254
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,080
Excuse me, who are you?

255
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:08,840
Zhou Changhao.

256
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,700
Well?

257
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,410
Come on.

258
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:38,850
Hey, guys.

259
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,170
Come on.

260
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,750
-Here.
-Fill it up.

261
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:46,110
Thank you for eating lunch
with me, everyone.

262
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,610
-Cheers
-Wen Ran.

263
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:49,150
-Cheers.
-Thank you, Wen Ran.

264
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,810
Eat well and drink well.

265
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,130
It's my treat. Do you hear me?

266
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:56,100
Okay!

267
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,390
No, it's from Mr. Glasses.

268
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,450
-Okay.
-Thank you, Mr. Glasses.

269
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,860
-Come on.
-Nature calls.

270
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:02,830
You guys can go ahead.

271
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,800
Okay.

272
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:04,770
Thank you, Wen Ran.

273
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:06,829
Come on.

274
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:22,940
This is Zhao Ran. Something is going on.

275
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,480
Do you suspect

276
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,849
Glasses is fetching Spectre's man?

277
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:30,900
Okay.

278
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,260
I understand.

279
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,360
Be careful.

280
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,600
Should we ask Rong Yao

281
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,670
to check Glasses's driving route?

282
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,180
It doesn't mean much right now.

283
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,360
How about this?

284
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,120
Go back to Mr. Ou's house later.

285
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,300
Keep an eye on Mr. Ou.

286
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:51,620
Let me see

287
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,180
if I can find a breakthrough from Glasses.

288
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,730
What are you going to do?

289
00:17:58,930 --> 00:18:00,470
Use the dark web trading system.

290
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,710
Dark web?

291
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,140
I think if Spectre's man came to Yungang,

292
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,610
I'm sure he's interested
in our dark web trading system.

293
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,810
Then we'll just rig the system

294
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,890
so that Glasses has to ask me for help.

295
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,690
Are you planning

296
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,230
to let Glasses make a fool of himself

297
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,770
in front of Mr. Ou and Spectre?

298
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,320
Wouldn't it be risky?

299
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,120
I'll wait for the organization's decision.

300
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,370
I already met Zhou Changhao.

301
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,580
I already passed your message to him.

302
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:36,990
He gave a statement.

303
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,700
He can see us anytime.

304
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,870
From what you've observed,

305
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,500
what do you think of him?

306
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:45,210
He is arrogant and a clean freak.

307
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,190
I can't figure him out.

308
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,450
That's normal.

309
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,000
He is Spectre's man after all.

310
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:55,860
Sir.

311
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,330
What should we do next?

312
00:18:59,070 --> 00:19:00,260
Leave him hanging all night.

313
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,250
Is that appropriate?

314
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:06,070
Since he's in no hurry to talk to us,

315
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,960
why do we have to rush over to see him?

316
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,820
Tell him we'll see him tomorrow night.

317
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:12,760
Yes.

318
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:14,470
My godfather wants you to marry Kexin

319
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,880
and then leave the country.

320
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:20,060
What exactly is he thinking?

321
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,300
But Kexin doesn't like
to go abroad at all.

322
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,180
But if Mr. Ou insists,

323
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,410
can Kexin stop him?

324
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,190
It seems Mr. Ou

325
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,690
doesn't want me and Kexin

326
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,270
to get involved with Spectre.

327
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,980
That's obvious.

328
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:40,960
But my godfather has always been

329
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:42,760
against you two getting together.

330
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,360
Now, he's entrusting Kexin to you.

331
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,300
I don't understand this.

332
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,640
Kexin likes me.

333
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:52,140
Letting me take her away

334
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,250
is the best compromise made by Mr. Ou.

335
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,580
If we leave together,

336
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,430
the deal between Mr. Ou and Spectre

337
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,920
won't have any distractions.

338
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,510
Once the deal is done,

339
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,140
he can separate us anytime.

340
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,520
Actually, I already know

341
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,200
that Mr. Ou doesn't want me

342
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,380
to be together with Kexin.

343
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,360
Nor does he want me to see Spectre.

344
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:14,490
This could be a way to stall us.

345
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,290
To kill two birds with one stone.

346
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,400
Brutal. All brutal moves.

347
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,150
The really brutal moves

348
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,740
are all used on you.

349
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,170
What does that have to do with me?

350
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,440
Think about it.

351
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,240
Once the deal is done

352
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:36,570
after Spectre's man leaves Yungang,

353
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,640
Glasses will point his knife at you.

354
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:40,230
I'm on your side.

355
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,280
By then,

356
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,820
Kexin and I won't be by your side.

357
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,770
Do you think you'll have a good life?

358
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,500
It's a complete package.

359
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:55,540
I'm sure it was Glasses's idea.

360
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,170
He's trying to kill us both.

361
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:02,580
But it's not that
there's no gleam of hope.

362
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,260
How so?

363
00:21:05,610 --> 00:21:07,070
As long as we can get to Spectre.

364
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,760
Are you out of your mind?

365
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:14,150
We don't even know
what Spectre's man looks like.

366
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,600
Where are we going to find him?

367
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,310
I have a plan with Kexin.

368
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,850
Do you want to hear it?

369
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:26,200
Dad, have some tea.

370
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,680
Why did you suddenly come back?

371
00:21:30,470 --> 00:21:31,880
"Suddenly come back"?

372
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,430
This is my house. Can't I come home?

373
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:35,580
No, you...

374
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,290
Shouldn't you pack things up

375
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,440
for going abroad?

376
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,060
Are you refusing to leave again?

377
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,440
I'm not leaving today.

378
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,770
Besides, I don't have that much stuff.

379
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,520
Am I that disobedient in your eyes?

380
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:53,880
Don't worry.

381
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:55,820
I'll listen to you this time.

382
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,710
I'll go abroad with Mu Qing.

383
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,580
Before I leave,

384
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,990
can't I spend more time with you?

385
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,650
I know.

386
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,340
You think I'm a nuisance.

387
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,490
I'm impatient
and I do things without thinking.

388
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,680
I will do as I please.

389
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,260
I knew I was wrong.

390
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,660
I regret it now.

391
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,510
I think before I leave,

392
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,190
I should spend more time with you.

393
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,820
Be good to you.

394
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:27,580
Be a good daughter.

395
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:37,920
Do you know?

396
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:41,790
Actually, I hated you before.

397
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,800
I hated you
for leaving me and my mom in France.

398
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,450
When she left, I hated the fact

399
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:52,350
that you didn't even come back once.

400
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,920
I hated you for taking away my family.

401
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:00,930
Back then,

402
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,780
my mom left.

403
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:05,550
At a mansion in France,

404
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,500
I did everything by myself.

405
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:11,410
Nobody talked to me.

406
00:23:11,630 --> 00:23:12,900
Nobody cared about me.

407
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,450
Not even a sentence.

408
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,170
"Have you eaten?"

409
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:19,280
No one asked.

410
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,190
That's when I thought

411
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,250
I don't want to see you ever again.

412
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,470
If I hadn't caused trouble in France,

413
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:32,830
I wouldn't come back.

414
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,960
But do you know?

415
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,600
It's strange.

416
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,590
No matter how much I hated you,

417
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,660
no matter how much I argued with you,

418
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,180
the moment I saw you,

419
00:23:53,910 --> 00:23:55,540
it feels like home again.

420
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,440
Dad.

421
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,570
When I came home and stayed here with you,

422
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,160
I finally understood.

423
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,290
I know why you did

424
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,610
what you had to do last time.

425
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:18,060
I thought I lost my home.

426
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:22,640
I get it now.

427
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,370
Where there's you,

428
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,130
there's my home.

429
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,890
But talking about this is too late, right?

430
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,630
Dad.

431
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:42,660
After I leave,

432
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:44,640
you'll have no family by your side.

433
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,350
Take good care of yourself.

434
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:48,110
When you wake up every morning,

435
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,830
you cough for half an hour.

436
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,550
I ordered monk fruits for you.

437
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,910
It will be here in a few days.

438
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,450
I've already spoken to Li Ruosheng.

439
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,810
He'll infuse it for you.

440
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,830
But look at you.

441
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,500
You never had gray hair before.

442
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,600
You have it now.

443
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,890
Take care of your health too.

444
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:08,050
Okay?

445
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,230
I promise.

446
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:15,000
I'll take care of myself.

447
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,810
Then promise me one more thing.

448
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,390
Tell me.

449
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,810
Teach me some home-cooked meals.

450
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:26,660
What's wrong?

451
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:29,380
Didn't you say that
Mu Qing is a good cook?

452
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,920
That's different.

453
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,170
We're going abroad. You're not with me.

454
00:25:34,050 --> 00:25:35,500
If I eat your home-cooked meal,

455
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,140
I'll feel like you're by my side.

456
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:41,480
Okay.

457
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:44,920
Get some of your favorite ingredients

458
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,410
tomorrow morning.

459
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:47,860
I'll teach you.

460
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,630
Have a drink. It's getting cold.

461
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,730
Okay.

462
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,560
Sir.

463
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,070
Zhou Changhao agreed to meet you.

464
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,560
I've arranged everything.

465
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,840
Sir.

466
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,710
Did you stay up all night?

467
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:40,620
It's all set, right?

468
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,850
What time?

469
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,040
It's 7 p.m. tonight.

470
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,230
He's meeting us here.

471
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,410
Go get him.

472
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,050
It's still early.

473
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,730
I want to accompany Kexin.

474
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,610
Sir.

475
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,520
This matter

476
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,080
involving Kexin and Mu Qing.

477
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:06,800
Can we wait

478
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,560
until Zhou Changhao's departure

479
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,660
before fixing it?

480
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,110
After all,

481
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,560
sending Kexin abroad

482
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:13,570
is just a show.

483
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:15,250
It's not like she's not coming back.

484
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,450
You don't have children.

485
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,530
You have no idea how I feel right now.

486
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,180
If it weren't

487
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,910
for preventing problems from cropping up,

488
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:28,800
I wasn't going to see her off.

489
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,400
And it's only getting worse.

490
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,690
I can't live without her.

491
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:39,970
But sir,

492
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,820
tonight is our only chance

493
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,550
to make a comeback.

494
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,140
I know that.

495
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,510
You don't have to tell me.

496
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:50,880
All right, you can go.

497
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,420
Don't come back before 7 p.m.

498
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,110
Wait.

499
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,520
Here.

500
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,030
Hold the knife.

501
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:41,390
Left hand.

502
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,460
The fingers pressing on the vegetables

503
00:28:43,550 --> 00:28:44,830
must curve inward.

504
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,230
Knuckles face upward.

505
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,550
Push forward.

506
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:48,790
As for the knife,

507
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,370
the front is facing forward.

508
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:52,040
When you slice it,

509
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,150
roll the blade forward.

510
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,000
Remember how it feels to roll it.

511
00:28:59,870 --> 00:29:01,020
Is it easier now?

512
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,780
You're right.

513
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:04,100
Practice more.

514
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,740
Slicing vegetables alone

515
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,010
requires so many techniques.

516
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:09,110
Of course.

517
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:10,650
Dad.

518
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,280
How did you learn how to cook?

519
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,440
When I was young,

520
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,960
Mr. Glasses, Dakun, and I.

521
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,890
The three of us fought

522
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:22,530
with a few guys over a shop.

523
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,470
What can we do? We ran away.

524
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:27,070
Back then, your mom was already with me.

525
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,270
She insisted that the three of us
brought her along.

526
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,110
I was lucky to have her too.

527
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,530
None of us starved all the way here.

528
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,260
So you learned how to cook from my mom.

529
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:39,910
She's too tired to do this alone.

530
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,140
I learned how to cook

531
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:42,990
mainly to share her burden.

532
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,970
I got better at it.

533
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,950
I took over the kitchen after that.

534
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,280
In the end,

535
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,360
Congtou and Tieguanyin were also in.

536
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,520
Our business grew.

537
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:57,690
But I'm always afraid.

538
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:01,340
I was afraid my enemies and the police
will go after you two.

539
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:03,320
In the end,

540
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,520
I sent you two abroad.

541
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,960
When you're amazing at cooking back then,

542
00:30:10,050 --> 00:30:12,690
why didn't you switch jobs
and open a restaurant?

543
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:16,080
Mr. Glasses also said that.

544
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,630
If I weren't in this industry,

545
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,520
I'd open up a restaurant instead.

546
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,690
My life may be better than this.

547
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:26,950
It's too late now.

548
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,060
There's no such thing as regret.

549
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:32,090
Until your mom died,

550
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:33,940
I haven't had another bite

551
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,350
of your mom's cooking.

552
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:38,470
That can be considered
the biggest regret in my life.

553
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,870
But Mom taught you how to make this.

554
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,770
And now you're teaching me.

555
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:46,170
If I cook for you,

556
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,510
that means you're eating her cooking.

557
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:49,960
Give me a break.

558
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,410
You just started

559
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:53,390
and you want to imitate
your mom's cooking.

560
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,730
Take a sniff in this kitchen.

561
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,790
There's a smell, right?

562
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,530
What's burned?

563
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,080
Take a look at your beef tofu stew.

564
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,060
I forgot to lower the heat.

565
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,770
Hey.

566
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,320
Hydrogen iodide can't be heated.

567
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,480
It will poison all of you.

568
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:18,340
And you.

569
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,880
Hey, you.

570
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:23,000
Didn't you see
pseudoephedrine has been added?

571
00:31:23,090 --> 00:31:24,670
Take care of the ratio of ingredients.

572
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:25,910
If you mess up,

573
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:27,310
I'll fry all of you to death.

574
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,130
None of you are dependable.

575
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,070
Hey.

576
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,600
Mr. Glasses, you're here.

577
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,070
Wen Ran, listen.

578
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,400
By 7 p.m. tonight,

579
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,960
you need to give us another 5kg.

580
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,720
By 7 p.m.?

581
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,560
What's the time now?

582
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,150
It's 2 p.m.

583
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,890
What's with the tight deadline?

584
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,440
Our men haven't eaten yet.

585
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,300
Just do what Mr. Glasses says.

586
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:00,880
Why are you talking so much nonsense?

587
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,750
Since Mr. Glasses spoke,

588
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,730
I have nothing more to say.

589
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,720
Hurry up, guys.

590
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,140
Five hours to go, 5kg of goods!

591
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,160
[7 p.m. tonight.]

592
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:32,700
[Confirm to delete the message?]

593
00:33:07,190 --> 00:33:08,860
[Hey, it's me.]

594
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:10,090
Hold on.

595
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,370
This is Zheng Ke, speaking.

596
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:17,620
I've entered the dark web trading system.

597
00:33:17,710 --> 00:33:19,330
How long will your hacking take?

598
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:20,430
Soon.

599
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:23,160
[Police for the public]

600
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,840
All right, inject the Trojan horse.

601
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,600
Okay, hold on.

602
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,680
[Program output]

603
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,650
[Program output]

604
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,410
It's 7 p.m. sharp tonight.

605
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,770
Use the Trojan horse

606
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,970
to create a system upgrade disorder.

607
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,730
After that, change the password.

608
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,590
[Okay, I'll send you
the new password beforehand.]

609
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,920
Okay, thank you.

610
00:33:51,850 --> 00:33:52,860
Hey.

611
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,660
How's the setup going?

612
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,160
It's all set.

613
00:33:56,250 --> 00:33:57,260
[Don't worry.]

614
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,280
[In the whole villa,]

615
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,650
[I installed dozens of cameras.]

616
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,410
[As soon as Spectre's man comes in,]

617
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,730
[we'll get a photo of him.]

618
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,370
So just let Zheng Ke

619
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,610
receive the video data the entire time.

620
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:09,760
Good.

621
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,030
I'll wait to hear from you.

622
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,260
By then we'll work together.

623
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,850
Get the image data no matter what.

624
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,340
Of course.

625
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:36,860
Here you go.

626
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,090
Here.

627
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:42,449
Does it smell good?

628
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:44,780
I'll get you some.

629
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:53,090
It's a little charred.

630
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:54,460
It's stuck at the bottom.

631
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,730
Try it.

632
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,020
Here you go.

633
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:05,900
This.

634
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,070
What do you think?

635
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,150
It is a little burned.

636
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,520
But it's unique and delicious.

637
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:15,750
Really?

638
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,030
I'll try something else.

639
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:25,790
What do you think?

640
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,130
It's good.

641
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,810
However,

642
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,370
did you put vinegar

643
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,560
instead of soy sauce?

644
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:39,510
No way.

645
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:40,960
How is that possible?

646
00:35:47,650 --> 00:35:48,710
I'll make you a new one.

647
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,250
No, you don't have to.

648
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,180
It's delicious as long as
it's made by you.

649
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:53,370
Don't move. That's it.

650
00:35:53,990 --> 00:35:55,090
Really?

651
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,380
Eat up.

652
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:02,740
Dad.

653
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,520
After I leave,

654
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:07,670
don't skip your meals.

655
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:11,810
I know.

656
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,610
After you leave,

657
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,720
I need to eat well

658
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,570
and take good care of myself.

659
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,070
Don't worry.

660
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:21,440
After you settle down there

661
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:22,720
and my business is stabilized,

662
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,040
I'll meet you there.

663
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,840
I'll keep you company, okay?

664
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,950
Can we eat now?

665
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,190
It's good.

666
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:49,210
[Here, have some Chinese yams too.]

667
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,100
[-Okay.]
[-It's good for your lungs.]

668
00:37:11,210 --> 00:37:12,390
[Hello?]

669
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:13,760
It's me.

670
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,340
[How did it go?]

671
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,810
I put on an act

672
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,610
and it's working.

673
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,780
I think Mr. Ou

674
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,320
probably doesn't want me to leave.

675
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,610
He just hasn't let it go yet.

676
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,450
It's okay.

677
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:30,040
If he has this thought,

678
00:37:30,130 --> 00:37:31,620
we have a shot at winning.

679
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:42,440
Hey.

680
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,030
[Are you still there?]

681
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,370
I'm here.

682
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:50,190
What's wrong?

683
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,410
Nothing happened.

684
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,580
I just...

685
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,670
I feel conflicted.

686
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,290
What made you feel that way?

687
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,250
For a moment there,

688
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,770
I feel like I'm Ou Kexin.

689
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,600
I feel bad.

690
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:25,780
We live our lives with double identities.

691
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:27,850
It's normal.

692
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,890
But don't forget.

693
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,780
You're a police officer.

694
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,360
Not Ou Kexin.

695
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,500
I know.

696
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,430
Okay.

697
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:21,880
Go pick him up now.

698
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:23,470
Just be back by 7 p.m.

699
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,050
Dad.

700
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,470
Are you busy?

701
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,540
Go to Mu Qing's place first.

702
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,570
I have an important guest coming.

703
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,560
Okay then.

704
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:39,790
I'm leaving.

705
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:01,830
Ms. Ou.

["The Place Farthest Away" playing]

707
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:15,470
♫ Against the light ♫

708
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:18,600
♫ Your vague silhouette ♫

709
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,460
♫ I reach out with my hands ♫

710
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,930
♫ But my hug passes through you ♫

711
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,670
♫ Maybe this is an illusion ♫

712
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,830
♫ A sweet dream ♫

713
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,560
♫ Waiting for you ♫

714
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:37,210
♫ To notice it and wake me up ♫

715
00:40:37,910 --> 00:40:39,850
♫ I wonder if getting close to you ♫

716
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,130
♫ One swirl will light up the stars ♫

717
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:48,600
♫ I wonder if someone
will tell you for me ♫

718
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,810
♫ At the place farthest away ♫

719
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,970
♫ Only then will the kites roam freely ♫

720
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,700
♫ If I gaze relentlessly ♫

721
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:03,690
♫ I wonder if there will be starlight ♫

722
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,860
♫ If the falling fireworks ♫

723
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:10,070
♫ Give me the sadness of being lonely ♫

724
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,540
♫ If your gaze gives me ♫

725
00:41:12,630 --> 00:41:14,650
♫ A sense of direction ♫

726
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:19,400
♫ I'll give you an answer too ♫

727
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,570
♫ Looking at your turbulent silence ♫

728
00:41:35,070 --> 00:41:39,640
♫ I really hope you can understand ♫

729
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:45,930
♫ So I remain extremely quiet and gentle ♫

730
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:52,000
♫ Waiting for you to kiss my forehead ♫

731
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,640
♫ It seems you're in front of me ♫

732
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:57,330
♫ Like the four seasons in my heart ♫

733
00:41:59,090 --> 00:42:00,450
♫ Gentle and heart-wrenching ♫

734
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,880
♫ What can I say? ♫

735
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:06,790
♫ At the place farthest away ♫

736
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,040
♫ Only then will the kites roam freely ♫

737
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:12,600
♫ If I gaze relentlessly ♫

738
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:15,760
♫ I wonder if there will be starlight ♫

739
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:18,890
♫ Standing on your spot ♫

740
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:22,230
♫ Only then will I forget
the faraway place ♫

741
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,600
♫ Only your gaze ♫

742
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,810
♫ Can give me acknowledgment ♫

743
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:33,060
♫ Can give me an answer ♫
