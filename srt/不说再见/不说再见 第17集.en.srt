[Episode 17]

3
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,520
[Hello, Director Liu.]

4
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:53,509
It's me.

5
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:57,470
Rong Yao?

6
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,070
Now, the dealers, buyers,

7
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,390
and transporters of Group K

8
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,190
are all under our surveillance.

9
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,039
Good job.

10
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,550
Director Liu wants to thank you.

11
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,320
I want to thank you too.

12
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,740
What else do you need?

13
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,470
[Keep an eye on Tieguanyin for me.]

14
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,579
[She's in charge of the drug factory.]

15
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,410
She'll give me a big shipment soon.

16
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,040
When that happens,

17
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,329
we can take down her factory.

18
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,880
I'll have a plan for my next move.

19
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,900
Okay, I'll take care of it.

20
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,570
[Also,]

21
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,810
we can start

22
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,350
from Tieguanyin's cargo point.

23
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,120
She'll have to restock it.

24
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,310
I got it.

25
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,860
Okay, that's all.

26
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,270
[Wait.]

27
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,300
What's wrong?

28
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,730
Be safe.

29
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,660
Mu Qing.

30
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,480
You too.

31
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,380
Remember.

32
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,760
My name is Liu Yuanwen.

33
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,120
Get back to work.

34
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:23,990
Don't move!

35
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,040
Get down. Now!

36
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:26,190
Hands up. Don't move!

37
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,380
Police!

38
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,220
Don't move!

39
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,300
Don't move!

40
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,159
Take him away!

41
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,180
Run! Hurry!

42
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,320
Go to the second floor!

43
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,760
Freeze! Don't move!

44
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:54,210
Stop right there!

45
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:01,470
Hurry. Take them out!

46
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,530
Come out!

47
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:04,910
-Come out!
-What are you doing?

48
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,090
Come on!

49
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:07,900
Stay still.

50
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,610
Move!

51
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,680
-Freeze!
-Don't move!

52
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:20,660
Get down here or we'll shoot.

53
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,020
-I'm coming down now.
-Faster!

54
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,080
Get down now!

55
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:24,530
Move.

56
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,890
-Stay still.
-Move!

57
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,920
Let's go. Keep it steady.

58
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,150
Come out!

59
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,780
Move.

60
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,710
Stay still.

61
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,550
Captain Rong.

62
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,090
Do you think our team

63
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:40,770
deserves a second-rate award?

64
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,320
Stop talking. Hurry up and move them.

65
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,909
-Move them.
-What's wrong with you?

66
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,200
Less talk, more actions.

67
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:49,870
It's such a happy occasion.

68
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,770
I don't get it. Why the long face?

69
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:52,820
Director Liu.

70
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:55,290
It's quite a success, isn't it?

71
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,090
Director Liu.

72
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,190
Good work, everyone.

73
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,510
Rong Yao.

74
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,090
You must treat them well.

75
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,540
Do you have any requests, guys?

76
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,790
Director Liu, can we take a few days off?

77
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,420
We are getting exhausted.

78
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,470
Take a few days off?

79
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,920
We can't slack off yet.

80
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,460
Who said we're slacking off?

81
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:12,620
You two are indestructible.

82
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,420
But I need to sleep.

83
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:17,150
They're right.

84
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,650
You need some rest.

85
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,880
Don't overwork.

86
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,990
As for taking a few days off,

87
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,800
you'd better listen to your captain.

88
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:25,290
Rong Yao.

89
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,700
Let's get to work.

90
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:27,670
Here.

91
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:30,350
The drug situation in Yungang

92
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,580
is really serious.

93
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:32,600
You see.

94
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,190
We just busted Dakun's drug network.

95
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,300
Now, there's already a new one.

96
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,670
Here.

97
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,040
If we're doing this,

98
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,070
-Slowly.
-we have to do it one step at a time.

99
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,700
Slow down like you're eating.

100
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,800
You can't rush it.

101
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,470
Here.

102
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,790
I understand, Director Liu.

103
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,560
The only reason I'm here

104
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:52,790
is to catch drug dealers.

105
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,730
Otherwise, I would let down Rong Yu

106
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,620
and Yuanwen who is on the front line.

107
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,420
So I really can't be happy

108
00:06:58,510 --> 00:06:59,700
about a small success.

109
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,120
I understand how you feel.

110
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,800
Director Liu.

111
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,500
My dad and younger sister

112
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,320
both died for Drug Enforcement Squad.

113
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,040
I don't have a family.

114
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,680
I have nothing.

115
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,980
But I don't want others to be like me.

116
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,330
I hope that this city can be cleansed.

117
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,310
And for that,

118
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,210
I'll keep doing my best.

119
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,510
-I'll get back to work.
-Go on.

120
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,620
Our operation last night was a success.

121
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:47,480
It was thanks to your dark web system.

122
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:48,930
On the surface,

123
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,100
it hides the dealers.

124
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,250
But at the same time,

125
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:54,870
it's also under our surveillance.

126
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,050
The dealers just learned how good it is.

127
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,210
I think

128
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,030
we might as well play the long game.

129
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,090
We'll use the dark web system

130
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,680
to take Group K down completely.

131
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,350
Okay.

132
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,240
Let's go with your plan.

133
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,740
Director Liu.

134
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,070
There's something I want to tell you.

135
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,390
What?

136
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,970
I've made contact with Skylark.

137
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:19,910
That's great.

138
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,550
You'll have to cooperate well.

139
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,590
I really didn't expect

140
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:28,580
that the unruly Ou Kexin is Skylark.

141
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,000
I just found out who she is too.

142
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,690
She's Ou Zhenhai's goddaughter.

143
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,159
They're not related by blood.

144
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,559
A long time ago,

145
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,409
her dad was killed by a drug dealer

146
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,730
to protect Ou Zhenhai.

147
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,880
From that moment on,

148
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,110
he has been treating Ou Kexin

149
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,430
as his own daughter.

150
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,230
Afterward, he sent her and her mom

151
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,820
to live abroad.

152
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,880
She was only a few months old then.

153
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,470
Judging from the situation,

154
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,920
no one around Ou Zhenhai

155
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,210
knows this secret.

156
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,210
The bureau didn't tell us

157
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,800
who she was right away

158
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,350
because she has a bigger

159
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,020
and more confidential mission.

160
00:09:06,110 --> 00:09:07,080
On the other hand,

161
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:10,380
it was to ensure both of your safety.

162
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:12,970
Of course.

163
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,080
Even for a girl who came back from abroad,

164
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,490
she's too open-minded.

165
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,470
It's so simple and straightforward.

166
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:21,860
Have you gotten used to it yet?

167
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,630
Being simple and straightforward?

168
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,330
It's okay.

169
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,520
I'm used to it a little.

170
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,450
Kexin, what's the matter?

171
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,080
Dear Mr. Ou,

172
00:09:48,610 --> 00:09:50,240
I'm not a child anymore.

173
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:54,330
I don't need your concerns and worries.

174
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,070

00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,590
But...

346
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,320
But Liu Yuanwen and Rong Yu

347
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,900
were in a relationship.

348
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,510
Rong Yu is already dead to him.

349
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:17,630
Arranging for them to meet...

350
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,880
Director Liu.

351
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,020
Calm down.

352
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,910
Let me finish.

353
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,540
Three years ago,

354
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:27,140
in order to find more evidence on Mr. Ou,

355
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:28,850
we thought

356
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,920
that his daughter, Ou Kexin,

357
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,240
was our chance.

358
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:33,910
[Unexpectedly,]

359
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,900
[his daughter was murdered.]

360
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,620
[For years,]

361
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,600
[we've been keeping it a secret.]

362
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:43,200
[We wanted to find someone]

363
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,880
[who resembles her to pretend to be her.]

364
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:49,180
[By appearance and look,]

365
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,290
[Rong Yu, your sister,]

366
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,320
[was our best choice.]

367
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,810
[But again,]

368
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,750
[after we decided,]

369
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,380
[she had an accident too.]

370
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,970
You know what happened back then.

371
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,770
Rong Yu had an accident on a mission.

372
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,890
Everyone thought she was dead.

373
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,530
But before that,

374
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,830
[Rong Yu had agreed to participate]

375
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,080
[in our three years of operation.]

376
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,880
[So...]

377
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,210
[we used the accident.]

378
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,630
[We made it look like she died.]

379
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,930
[Then she told us]

380
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,230
[she wanted to be more like Ou Kexin.]

381
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,080
[She wanted to go to France]

382
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,590
[to learn everything about Ou Kexin.]

383
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,900
She only had one request.

384
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:41,100
[She wanted to keep it a secret]

385
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,690
[from her family, you, and Yuanwen.]

386
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,590
[She said]

387
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,390
[that she couldn't be distracted.]

388
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,120
[So...]

389
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,980
[we had to respect her decision.]

390
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,960
We've been hiding this from you

391
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,540
for so long.

392
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:59,050
On behalf of the bureau,

393
00:20:00,330 --> 00:20:01,600
I sincerely apologize.

394
00:20:19,330 --> 00:20:20,260
[Rong Yao.]

395
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,740
Rong Yao.

396
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,370
-Rong Yao.
-I'll ask her.

397
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,640
Why did she do this? Why?

398
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,280
Director Liu. Captain Rong.

399
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,650
Let's talk somewhere else.

400
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,000
I want to meet her.

401
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,070
I want to meet her too.

402
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,660
Rong Yao.

403
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,330
I think

404
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,800
we don't have to worry

405
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,300
about Rong Yu.

406
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,280
She trained for three years.

407
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,480
She must have known

408
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:25,200
that the insider was Yuanwen.

409
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,840
I'm sure she prepared herself

410
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:29,560
before she took the mission.

411
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,640
At the same time,

412
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,310
we must believe in the bureau.

413
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,730
The bureau must have known

414
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,920
about their relationship.

415
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,010
They would've taken care of it.

416
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,520
But I'm worried about Yuanwen the most.

417
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,290
If one day...

418
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:58,070
What if he senses

419
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,960
that he's not facing Ou Kexin,

420
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,770
but his lover, Rong Yu,

421
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,230
who died three years ago,

422
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:09,990
and can't control his emotions?

423
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,830
Feel free to look around.

424
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:24,550
I didn't expect to meet her like that.

425
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:28,030
No matter what,

426
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,270
before the mission is complete,

427
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,270
we can never let Yuanwen know.

428
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,770
We also have to

429
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,330
work with them.

430
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:40,170
Complete our mission as soon as possible.

431
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,150
Rong Yao.

432
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:47,700
We should be happy

433
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,680
that Rong Yu is still alive.

434
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,880
And she's still fighting.

435
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,340
You have a great sister.

436
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,610
When did this shop open?

437
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:10,750
I've never seen it.

438
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,070
It's new.

439
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,480
Not a lot of people know.

440
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,760
So if you like our shop,

441
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,120
-recommend us to someone.
-Okay.

442
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,720
Come back here if you need anything.

443
00:23:19,510 --> 00:23:20,830
We won't be strangers.

444
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,320
You can have a discount.

445
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,480
When did you come up here?

446
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,190
Just now.

447
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:45,910
What's wrong?

448
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,460
It's okay.

449
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,440
I just wanted some fresh air.

450
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,480
What exactly happened?

451
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,720
Didn't I tell you I'm fine?

452
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:57,130
I just want to be alone.

453
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,720
Fine then. Why are you mad?

454
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,780
Do you want some coffee?

455
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:09,320
Americano or latte?

456
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,460
Cold or...

457
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,990
Stop pretending to be cool.

458
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,800
My goodness.

459
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,510
Welcome.

460
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:10,910
Hello, what would you like?

461
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,170
Sir, a bottle of mineral water

462
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,360
and bread, please.

463
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,770
All right. Hold on.

464
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,640
Here you go. Please scan it.

465
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,200
-Okay. Thank you.
-Here you go.

466
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:48,840
Hello.

467
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,000
It's the first time you call me.

468
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:53,200
What's wrong? Did you miss me?

469
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,220
[I just want to know.]

470
00:25:55,310 --> 00:25:56,450
[Aside from me,]

471
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,180
is there anyone else who cares about you?

472
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,320
There are people who care about me.

473
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,000
Why? Are you jealous?

474
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,220
How could I be jealous?

475
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,460
I have confidence in myself.

476
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:28,880
[Let's go on a date tomorrow.]

477
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:31,300
I'll prove with my actions

478
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,150
that I'm the best boyfriend.

479
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:37,550
If I say yes, it will be inappropriate.

480
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,870
It's not my style either.

481
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:40,800
How about this?

482
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:43,180
I'll let you know when and where.

483
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:44,940
See you tomorrow.

484
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:49,790
All right, it's a deal.

485
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,900
We'll have beer and barbeque next time.

486
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,100
You're finally back.

487
00:27:54,190 --> 00:27:55,860
Is it okay to let Guanyin wait
for so long?

488
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,710
Guanyin, you're here.

489
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,290
You look different already.

490
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:05,020
We heard about what happened.

491
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,480
I came to congratulate you.

492
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,460
Thank you, Guanyin.

493
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,760
There must be more.

494
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,700
Do you have any orders for me?

495
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,460
I wouldn't dare to give orders,

496
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,220
but I have a favor to ask.

497
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,160
Tell me.

498
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,370
Buddy.

499
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:29,220
Tell me your method.

500
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,500
You sold a lot of goods

501
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,660
in such a short time.

502
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,950
How did you do it?

503
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,460
Guanyin.

504
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:41,100
You need to pay to be my student.

505
00:28:42,990 --> 00:28:44,350
You're going to charge me?

506
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,210
I have to make money, right?

507
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,410
Just give Guanyin a discount.

508
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,690
Go.

509
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,110
You're different now.

510
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,540
Now that Mr. Ou has your back,

511
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,740
you're so confident.

512
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,720
It's all for the group.

513
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:02,260
I'm just doing my job.

514
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:03,750
You give me the goods.

515
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,030
I sell them for you.

516
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,530
We both benefit from it.

517
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,680
As for having my back,

518
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,190
that's an overstatement.

519
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:14,010
Does that mean you won't help me?

520
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:17,220
If you put it that way...

521
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:20,780
I can't help you.

522
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:22,980
Okay then.

523
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:24,920
If you really won't tell me,

524
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:27,290
I won't force you.

525
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:28,480
I'm leaving.

526
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,280
Right.

527
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,490
There's a saying.

528
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,040
"Being overly clever

529
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,760
will bring you trouble."

530
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,610
Mu Qing.

531
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,420
You're very smart.

532
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,790
But...

533
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,190
"The wind blows the hardest

534
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,950
at the tallest wood."

535
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:52,860
You're the one who might get hurt.

536
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,690
Judging from that,

537
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,400
are you the wind?

538
00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:01,610
There are plenty of people

539
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,150
who want to be that wind.

540
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,180
I'm just reminding you.

541
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:07,160
All right.

542
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,570
Here.

543
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,340
It's the new warehouse.

544
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,230
The person in charge
and the number are here.

545
00:30:20,090 --> 00:30:21,060
Thank you, Guanyin.

546
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,630
You're so handsome.

547
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,160
Be careful.

548
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:36,940
We'll see you out.

549
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,310
There's no need.

550
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:48,250
I thought that Guanyin

551
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:50,280
was always at peace with the others.

552
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:51,600
After giving her our turf,

553
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,830
she gave it to Congtou.

554
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,720
Why was she so keen?

555
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,460
Do you really think that?

556
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,040
Why didn't you finish your sentence?

557
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,880
Guanyin was with Dakun

558
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,260
because he'd give her over 20% share

559
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:17,340
every time he made a deal.

560
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,100
Sometimes even more.

561
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,400
He gave her a 20% share?

562
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:23,940
So the two of them...

563
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:24,990
Yes.

564
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,980
Guanyin usually looks so uneager.

565
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,390
But actually,

566
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:31,770
she's the biggest worm in the group.

567
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,830
Now that Dakun is gone,

568
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,200
she doesn't profit much

569
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,520
from Dakun's properties.

570
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:39,690
So Guanyin is the most anxious one.

571
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:42,940
I always thought that Guanyin

572
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,800
was the only one loyal to my godfather.

573
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:48,490
I didn't know that
she was sleeping with Dakun.

574
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,360
I should tell my godfather.

575
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:55,000
Even if Mr. Ou finds out,

576
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,410
he won't do anything to her.

577
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,320
Ruosheng.

578
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:02,430
I know what you're thinking.

579
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:06,480
We're all doing this because of money.

580
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:10,050
People would just do anything for money.

581
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:12,600
Not to mention in our line of work.

582
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:14,800
What about you?

583
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,660
Would you have done the same?

584
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,760
All right.

585
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,520
I know you wouldn't.

586
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,280
You're not that kind of person.

587
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,300
What should we do next?

588
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:34,330
Next...

589
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,810
We're Guanyin's only option.

590
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,020
In the end, she'll ask us for her share.

591
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,320
So, in the future,

592
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,600
we'll give her 10%

593
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,620
every time we make a shipment.

594
00:32:47,710 --> 00:32:48,590
No way.

595
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,660
How is that any different from Dakun?

596
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,770
Don't push her too hard.

597
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,550
Think of it as paying for our safety.

598
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,060
Ruosheng.

599
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,920
We're only doing this now

600
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,030
so that we can stand here in the future

601
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,970
without any problems

602
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,040
and enjoy this view.

603
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,540
Ms. Guanyin, this is it.

604
00:33:36,370 --> 00:33:37,690
Are you sure?

605
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:39,540
My man pretended to be a delivery guy.

606
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:41,610
He saw a lot of computers and servers.

607
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:42,710
Are we doing this?

608
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,290
Of course we are.

609
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,590
But this is not

610
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,360
how you play the game.

611
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,250
Internet trick.

612
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:58,020
You little brat

613
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,050
just ran into my gun.

614
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,160
Drive.

615
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:57,950
Which one is better?

616
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,710
Which one do you like?

617
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,200
This one is pretty.

618
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,840
But isn't this a bit too long?

619
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,000
Let's try another one.

620
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,680
This one.

621
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,780
What do you think?

622
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,970
This one is nice.

623
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:13,300
But isn't this a bit too thick?

624
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,150
Let's see another one.

625
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,360
What about these?

626
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,040
This one is a bit flashier.

627
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,330
But I think

628
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,870
this one looks more innocent.

629
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,720
Boss, I think you're pretty.

630
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:27,860
You look good in anything.

631
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,400
Well said.

632
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,460
I'll give you a raise.

633
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,910
Hold this. I'll try it on.

634
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:10,100
Hey.

635
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,690
No way.

636
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,870
This is blue.

637
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,170
This is also blue.

638
00:36:31,050 --> 00:36:31,970
This is blue too.

639
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,200
It's a coincidence.

640
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,580
It's true love. We're synced.

641
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,080
Come on.

642
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,720
-There are so many people.
-What are you doing?

643
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:45,040
It's a date.

644
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,060
You should act properly.

645
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,320
Come on.

646
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:54,940
Smile.

647
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:56,830
You're too gloomy for a date.

648
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:03,120
Let me think.

649
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,970
We can look around there.

650
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:21,070
Sir, how much is this?

651
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,260
It's 100 yuan.

652
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:29,040
Come here.

653
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,720
Come here.

654
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:38,630
Fine, whatever.

655
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,560
I told you to come here.

656
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,140
What are you doing?

657
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,330
Come here.

658
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,610
Quick, look.

659
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,590
Let's get a painting.

660
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,520
It's fun.

661
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,680
Sir, I want one.

662
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:21,130
Which kind do you like?

663
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,290
I'll do one of those with big eyes

664
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,520
and tall nose.

665
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,880
The very cute one.

666
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:26,940
Okay.

667
00:38:27,470 --> 00:38:28,440
Look here.

668
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:53,260
Doesn't it look like me?

669
00:39:53,750 --> 00:39:55,770
Big eyes and a big nose.

670
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,400
Sir, you're good.

671
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,520
What's wrong?

672
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,060
Is something wrong?

673
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,520
It's nothing.

674
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:05,980
Are you in a bad mood?

675
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,270
That's not it.

676
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:10,510
I got it.

677
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,140
You're upset

678
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:13,940
by those people following us, aren't you?

679
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,940
It's okay. Don't mind them.

680
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:18,300
Let's have some fun.

681
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,200
Smile.

682
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:23,930
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

683
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:24,940
Let's go.

684
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,000
Come on.

685
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:33,880
A claw machine?

686
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,060
It's not that simple.

687
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:36,300
We're competing.

688
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,210
Let's see who can get the most dolls

689
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,020
with the same amount of money.

690
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,950
Can you play this?

691
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,100
Of course.

692
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,370
And I'm not finished.

693
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,910
The loser will get punished.

694
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,410
Get punished?

695
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,560
Sure. How about this?

696
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:52,970
If I win,

697
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,690
you have to do me a favor.

698
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,380
Can't you be more creative?

699
00:40:58,600 --> 00:40:59,700
If I win,

700
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,460
you'll owe me three favors.

701
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:03,140
That's impossible.

702
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,450
I'll prove to you

703
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,950
that I only owe you one.

704
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:07,750
Sure.

705
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,590
Sorry.

706
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:27,600
I can't see.

♫ It's pouring ♫

709
00:41:54,170 --> 00:41:57,430
♫ The cat is looking at you
from the lonely window ♫

710
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:00,820
♫ In those eyes ♫

711
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:03,940
♫ There are disappointment and memory ♫

712
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,680
♫ It's away from you ♫

713
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:11,160
♫ Half a teardrop away ♫

714
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:15,210
♫ So much intimacy ♫

715
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,230
♫ Is being remembered ♫

716

♫ Seem to melt in my night ♫

718
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,140
♫ The pain becomes a sigh ♫

719
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:31,040
♫ Carved onto the pillows as tears ♫

720
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:34,610
♫ I miss you ♫

721
00:42:34,870 --> 00:42:38,570
♫ You stay silent in my breath ♫

722
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:42,260
♫ Lie with me as you fall asleep ♫

723
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,290
♫ Until I wake up from my dream ♫

724

♫ Is to grow old together ♫

726

♫ The longest love ♫

727
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:57,840
♫ Is not to be heard from ♫

728
00:42:57,930 --> 00:42:59,950
♫ I still don't want to believe ♫

729
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:02,900
♫ So I won't give up ♫

730
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:06,290
♫ So I cry under the fireworks ♫

731
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,590
♫ So I'm afraid to be reminded ♫

00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,930
♫ That I miss you ♫

733

♫ To prove the greatness of love ♫

739
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,430
♫ The most romantic oblivion ♫

740
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:36,780
♫ Is to live the way you live ♫

741
