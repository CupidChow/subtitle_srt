00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:06,860
Are you pretending to be a cop?

176
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:09,370
Why are you here?

177
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,260
It's destiny.

178
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,890
I should say that to you.

179
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,900
Why are you here?

180
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,370
But you're here just in time.

181
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:18,210
I need some guys.

182
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,600
What guys?

183
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,850
Follow me.

184
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,750
Why would I listen to you?

185
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:30,270
Come.

186
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:31,940
Come on.

187
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,760
If it weren't for Mr. Ou...

188
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,120
Tell me, what are you doing here?

189
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,190
Where are you taking me?

190
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,170
Tell me what you're doing here.

191
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,840
Then I'll tell you where I'm taking you.

192
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,690
What are you doing here then?

193
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,050
You'll see.

194
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:53,590
You haven't answered me.

195
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,650
Why are you here?

196
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,300
What is this place?

197
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,200
This is where I keep my goods.

198
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,750
I extorted it from Mr. Dakun.

199
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,680
You extorted it?

200
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,390
Mr. Dakun's business is huge.

201
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,340
I only asked for one room.

202
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,700
He offered, so I took it.

203
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,740
Why didn't I know

204
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,140
that he has such a place?

205
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,340
It's probably for his personal business.

206
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:38,690
There's more.

207
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:40,670
It's close to the front,
so it's very convenient.

208
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,210
Just a few meters down the road,

209
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,180
there's a wall.

210
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,320
It's very secure.

211
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,990
I wanted to go in there.

212
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,000
But I got kicked out.

213
00:14:51,010 --> 00:14:52,200
Do you think

214
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,840
Mr. Dakun is going behind my dad's back?

215
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,510
Is he up to something?

216
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,190
Don't say that.

217
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,350
You don't know about the business.

218
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,400
However, you care about your dad now.

219
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,630
That's good.

220
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,610
Of course.

221
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,620
He's my dad.

222
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,160
Who else am I supposed to care about?

223
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,890
Besides,

224
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,160
our relationship

225
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,700
has finally gotten better.

226
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,560
We have to keep working on it.

227
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,200
How about this?

228
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:24,230
You should keep an eye on Mr. Dakun too.

229
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,900
Do it for me.

230
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,420
Do you trust me that much?

231
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,270
I know.

232
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,370
You and Li Ruosheng think

233
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:34,650
that Mr. Dakun is a thorn in your side.

234
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,250
Didn't you ask me to look into him before?

235
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,320
There's a saying.

236
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,690
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."

237
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,030
Regarding Mr. Dakun,

238
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:46,180
we're on the same side.

239
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,530
You've become smarter.

240
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,890
Become smarter?

241
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:52,250
I've always been smart.

242
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,060
I know everything.

243
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,130
Besides Mr. Dakun,

244
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,670
everyone around my dad

245
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,470
is just sucking up to me

246
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:01,190
because I'm my dad's daughter.

247
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,610
That's why I took advantage of them.

248
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,790
I'm not stupid.

249
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:06,910
Well done.

250
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,460
Like father, like daughter.

251
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,760
I learned a lot while living abroad alone.

252
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,560
I almost forgot the important stuff.

253
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,560
Come on.

254
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,580
Help me move these out.

255
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,610
[At this moment, for the first time,]

256
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,300
[I feel like this unreasonable girl]

257
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,800
[can be so witty at a time like this.]

258
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,300
[It reminds me.]

259
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:46,460
[She can also be]

260
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,400
[a helping force for me]

261
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,580
[to defeat the Four Vajras.]

262
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,819
Why aren't you moving?

263
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,890
Are you helping or not? Come on.

264
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,599
I'm coming.

265
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,710
Hurry up.

266
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,290
This way.

267
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:26,010
Captain Rong.

268
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,640
[I found the suspect, Mu Qing,]

269
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,830
[and a suspicious car.]

270
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,030
Are you sure?

271
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,610
I can't see his face.

272
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,650
But it looks a lot like him.

273
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:37,410
[There's a young woman by his side now.]

274
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,430
[I'm not sure if she's an accomplice.]

275
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,750
A woman?

276
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,130
Send me the plate number.

277
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:44,930
Leave it to me.

278
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,170
Okay.

279
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,110
-Is that all?
-There are more.

280
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,160
Let's go.

281
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,780
Are you helping or not?

282
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:10,280
I'm coming.

283
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:14,810
[Old man, the fish is too smart.]

284
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:17,050
[I'm calling it a day.]

285
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:21,580
[Captain Rong.]

286
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,340
[I've texted you the plate number.]

287
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,970
I'm going to help Yimeng now.

288
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,390
[Bao Yunhai and I are
in the abandoned factory.]

289
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,020
[We're going after Li Ruosheng.]

290
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,300
[I'll be right there.]

291
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:31,440
Where is Dakun?

292
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,070
[I've searched the whole block.]

293
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,740
I didn't see Dakun,

294
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:37,160
only Mu Qing and Li Ruosheng.

295
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,520
Just the two of them?

296
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:39,980
Yes.

297
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,000
-Hello?
-Let Li Ruosheng go.

298
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,060
Director Liu, we're on him.

299
00:18:51,150 --> 00:18:53,040
Wouldn't it too obvious?

300
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,460
Did I tell you to go easy on him?

301
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,780
Understood.

302
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:32,990
[Yimeng.]

303
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,770
-Captain Rong.
[-Stop the search now.]

304
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,570
[Let the others look for Li Ruosheng.]

305
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,630
Why?

306
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,900
[Dakun fooled us.]

307
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,930
Have Mr. Bao get some men

308
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,070
to look for Dakun.

309
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,350
Arrest him right away.

310
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:45,400
-Copy that.
-Yes.

311
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:47,650
Let's go.

312
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,490
Everyone, retreat!

313
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,550
Yes.

314
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:52,400
Come on.

315
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,730
-Let's go.
-Come on.

316
00:19:54,950 --> 00:19:55,920
Hurry.

317
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,150
Come on.

318
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,680
Yimeng.

319
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,320
Let's go.

320
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,540
It's finally done.

321
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,350
This color suits you very well.

322
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,710
To thank you,

323
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,740
I'll make you a suit.

324
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,380
Twenty percent off.

325
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,390
Are you really extorting me now?

326
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:57,820
I'm sorry, it's a habit.

327
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,190
But seriously,

328
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,950
this color suits you well.

329
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,400
Besides,

330
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:05,170
look at your clothes.

331
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,110
This fabric and this sewing.

332
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,430
How can this compare to mine?

333
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,990
Besides, why do I extort you?

334
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,750
Because I think highly of you.

335
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,600
Or else I could just extort Li Ruosheng.

336
00:21:18,190 --> 00:21:19,160
I think

337
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,100
you might as well do it to him.

338
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,460
He's richer than me.

339
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,370
He also focuses on his look a lot.

340
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,340
I won't.

341
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,710
I'll only extort you.

342
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,530
Whose car is it?

343
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:21,420
This is a fire exit. You can't park here.

344
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,480
Move it.

345
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,370
I got it.

346
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,380
Right. I just realized.

347
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,060
I have something important to do.

348
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:32,820
Let me borrow your car.

349
00:22:33,210 --> 00:22:34,930
My clothes are in the car.

350
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:37,080
I'll buy all of them. Okay?

351
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,180
Let me borrow it. Hurry.

352
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:39,500
You should've said so earlier.

353
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,130
I'll give you the bill.

354
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:43,110
One more thing.

355
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,870
Fill up my Xiaobai before you come back.

356
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,530
I can't stand people like you

357
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,510
who name their cars.

358
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,470
Take care.

359
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:13,780
Silly guy.

360
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:02,440
[Did you let him go?]

361
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,350
[Bad timing.]

362
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:10,800
[It's too late to turn back now.]

363
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:12,430
[It would look suspicious.]

364
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,350
[Yes, someone is watching.]

365
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,620
[Don't fall for it.]

366
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,100
[Captain Rong, we got a visual.]

367
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,090
Captain Rong.

368
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,140
What's happening?

369
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,330
The suspect is upstairs.

370
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,910
He's surrounded.

371
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,340
He might have a gun.

372
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,310
Be careful, everyone.

373
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,680
-Move in.
-Yes, sir.

374
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,820
Let's move.

375
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,580
[He's surrounded.]

376
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:10,390
[Use the cord to escape.]

377
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,160
Come on, stay close.

378
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,750
Hey, where are you?

379
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,110
I've escaped.

380
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,580
Listen, I won't make it out today.

381
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:39,600
The building is surrounded by the police.

382
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:40,830
I have nowhere else to run.

383
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:42,730
Where exactly are you?

384
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,960
I don't know.

385
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:47,260
I think I'm on the tallest building.

386
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,330
Go to the top.

387
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,190
Then what?

388
00:26:59,450 --> 00:27:00,330
Hurry up.

389
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,820
I'm going up.

390
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,670
[Do you see the building
across the street?]

391
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,780
The unfinished one? Yes, and then?

392
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,290
Can you see the zip line?

393
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,360
[There's a shipping bag by the window.]

394
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:11,900
The window?

395
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:16,910
My friend.

396
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,320
You want me to slide over.

397
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,690
I'm afraid of heights, you know?

398
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,020
The police will be there
in less than a minute.

399
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,430
[You're running out of time.]

400
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,000
I got it.

401
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,690
-I'll go check.
-Don't chase him.

402
00:28:01,790 --> 00:28:02,800
Find Dakun.

403
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,440
Hurry.

404
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,800
-Where?
-This way.

405
00:28:21,550 --> 00:28:22,520
Hurry.

406
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:55,290
What a thrill. My heart is pounding.

407
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,580
That was nerve-racking.

408
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,690
I thought today

409
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,190
would be the day we part ways.

410
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,580
If you die so easily,

411
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,810
it would be your own fault.

412
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,660
You pushed yourself too hard.

413
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,110
You drew the police to you.

414
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,870
I underestimated them, okay?

415
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:12,940
That's why I need you.

416
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,610
You're the strategist.

417
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:18,610
I owe you one again.

418
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,670
Remember it.

419
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,930
You ran so fast.

420
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:24,460
Did you use your long legs?

421
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:26,660
Keep that in mind.

422
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,750
Your seat belt is broken.

423
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,520
What is this?

424
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:38,850
What's wrong?

425
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,300
Why is there a lighter in my pocket?

426
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:06,920
[What?]

427
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,770
The police didn't capture

428
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,180
Li Ruosheng and Mu Qing?

429
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,180
Understood.

430
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,440
They're so useless.

431
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,300
They can't even catch two rats.

432
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,030
What are the police doing?

433
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,870
Mr. Dakun, what should we do now?

434
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,150
What do you think?

435
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,340
We should run.

436
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,880
Do you want to be arrested?

437
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,020
Go.

438
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:47,970
It's just a piece of junk.

439
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,960
I think it's a wiretapped tracking device.

440
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:56,030
Are you sure it was Dakun

441
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,130
who put it in your pocket?

442
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,070
I didn't meet anyone else except for him.

443
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:06,190
That Dakun gave us fake products.

444
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,260
Then the police showed up.

445
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:11,340
Could he have set us up?

446
00:31:13,450 --> 00:31:16,970
Dakun, Xiaofoye, and Laoba the Butcher.

447
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,080
Whoever wants us dead the most

448
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,500
is the one who set us up today.

449
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,450
But now,

450
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,690
it's obvious.

451
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,440
It's Dakun.

452
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,600
He's asking for it.

453
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,320
Don't throw it away. Keep it.

454
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,900
What's the point of keeping this?

455
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,630
Think about it.

456
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,830
If Dakun was behind this,

457
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,200
that would mean

458
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:49,090
we have something on Dakun.

459
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,820
He's a traitor now.

460
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,370
He ganged up on his own people.

461
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,450
He's even working with the police.

462
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,840
If Mr. Ou or other people in the group

463
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,950
find out about this,

464
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,880
what would they think?

465
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,700
We might as well use it against him.

466
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:09,900
That's right.

467
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,170
Since Dakun decided to be the mole,

468
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,410
then we'll find a way

469
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,230
to make him the official mole.

470
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,140
You worked well with Yuanwen this time.

471
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:35,640
Luckily, he reminded us

472
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,960
that this is Dakun's setup.

473
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,160
His people could be watching.

474
00:32:39,510 --> 00:32:41,970
So we kept acting.

475
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:44,440
But it's hard to explain to the team.

476
00:32:45,450 --> 00:32:46,420
Listen.

477
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:49,010
You can move in on our last suspect.

478
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,170
It would be a good reminder.

479
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:53,110
It will also boost our morale.

480
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:54,340
All right.

481
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:57,900
I...

482
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,110
I would like to meet Yuanwen.

483
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,490
Sure, but not now.

484
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:05,160
Why?

485
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,190
Aren't we working together now?

486
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,620
But what you did this time was very risky.

487
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,600
Thank goodness no one suspected.

488
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,360
If anyone finds out,

489
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,590
you'll be in big trouble.

490
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:17,880
That's why I want to see him.

491
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:21,090
Yuanwen is pretty close with a woman now.

492
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:25,050
Not just close, but...

493
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,680
What?

494
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,660
They're intimate.

495
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:32,970
Yuanwen is on a mission.

496
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,380
Don't get the wrong idea.

497
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,050
I'm worried if being with her

498
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,370
is safe for Yuanwen.

499
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,150
That's my concern as well.

500
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,280
Who is that girl?

501
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,120
She's a very special person.

502
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:49,120
Mr. Ou's only daughter, Ou Kexin.

503
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,400
She just came back from abroad.

504
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,000
But she doesn't know

505
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:55,100
about Mr. Ou's business.

506
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,440
Yuanwen saved her by accident.

507
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:01,700
That was how he met Mr. Ou.

508
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,449
She's pretty too.

509
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:11,989
Typical men.

510
00:34:15,650 --> 00:34:16,659
Captain Rong.

511
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:18,860
What did the director say

512
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,270
about our failed arrest?

513
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:22,989
Do we have any lead on Dakun?

514
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:24,449
We're still searching.

515
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,380
Keep searching then.

516
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,050
Who is the pretty woman

517
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:30,210
Mr. Zheng caught on the drone?

518
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:32,060
She's Mr. Ou's daughter.

519
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,330
Ou Kexin.

520
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:38,090
She's Ou Kexin?

521
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,510
What? Do you know her?

522
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:45,040
When we tailed Mr. Ou,

523
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:47,280
we knew he had a daughter named Ou Kexin.

524
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:48,690
She was in France.

525
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,360
Three years ago,

526
00:34:50,449 --> 00:34:51,900
she was the victim of a bombing.

527
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,320
She was lucky though.
Only her face was disfigured.

528
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:57,139
The suspect was Mr. Ou's enemy.

529
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,990
In order to protect his daughter,

530
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,790
Mr. Ou kept her abroad.

531
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,900
Basically, she's not involved at all.

532
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,350
They also don't talk much.

533
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,980
I didn't know about this.

534
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:07,960
Seriously, these drug dealers,

535
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,980
is that all worth it for the money?

536
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,880
They don't think about that at all.

537
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,680
It's because of their greed

538
00:35:13,810 --> 00:35:15,310
that families were ruined.

539
00:35:16,670 --> 00:35:17,820
But I think

540
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,590
we have to investigate her.

541
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,170
I don't believe

542
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,240
that she's innocent in that drug den.

543
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,040
I was also thinking.

544
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,510
Why did she choose to come back now?

545
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,740
Captain Rong.

546
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,500
I found out that she
runs a clothing store.

547
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:32,730
Give me the address.

548
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,760
Right.

549
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:36,780
Let's go to the garage tomorrow.

550
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:37,880
We'll shut it down.

551
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,520
Young man, you're in a bad mood.

552
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,720
Am I, old man?

553
00:35:53,630 --> 00:35:55,520
Dakun pulled a trick.

554
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,670
He set you up.

555
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,530
Can you handle the defeat?

556
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,000
I underestimated him.

557
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,690
I'll take care of Dakun.

558
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,400
After that...

559
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,440
After that, I'll let that...

560
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,130
Rong Yao.

561
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,920
It has been so long.

562
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,950
Do you still feel bad about it?

563
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,930
I just...

564
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,210
can't face him.

565
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:29,800
You two.

566
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,050
I told him to move on.

567
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,080
Now, I'm asking you to do the same.

568
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:39,350
From now on,

569
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,410
you two have to work together.

570
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:43,090
What more do I have to say?

571
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,770
I'm sure you already knew.

572
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,820
I understand, Director Liu.

573
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:51,670
That's good.

574
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:54,790
If you're moving in on Dakun,

575
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,800
give me a heads-up.

576
00:36:57,470 --> 00:36:58,350
Okay.

577
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,450
Hello, welcome.

578
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:07,990
Hello.

579
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:17,540
Feel free to look around.

580
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:20,660
Hello.

581
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,410
Everything here is custom-made.

582
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:27,130
If you see anything you like,

583
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:28,930
we can make it for you.

584
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:34,210
When did this shop open?

585
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,150
It's new.

586
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,730
Not a lot of people know.

587
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,830
So if you like our shop,

588
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,280
-recommend us to someone.
-Okay.

589
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,790
Is the second floor part of the shop?

590
00:37:43,190 --> 00:37:44,460
It's residential.

591
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,100
You're living with your family?

592
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,470
That's convenient.

593
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,230
I came back from abroad.

594
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,460
I'm used to being alone.

595
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,040
I don't like living with old people.

596
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,260
I'll get some fabric

597
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,800
-and let you take a look.
-It's fine.

598
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,250
If this is everything,

599
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,970
look at me.

600
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,640
It's not really my style anyway.

601
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,350
That's fine.

602
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:10,470
Come back here if you need anything.

603
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,240
We won't be strangers.
You can have a discount.

604
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:14,600
Sure. Have a good day.

605
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:15,970
Thank you.

606
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:17,550
Take care.

607
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,230
I can tell.

608
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:28,680
Is there anything else

609
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,220
you want to discuss with me?

610
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,380
Director Liu.

611
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,460
It's this Ou Kexin.

612
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,850
Recently, she has been

613
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,960
coming to me on purpose.

614
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,630
She's using many ways

615
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,870
to keep me around her.

616
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,320
To be honest,

617
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,950
she's too unpredictable.

618
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:52,490
I can't keep up with her.

619
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,210
I'm a little worried now.

620
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,840
She might ruin the mission.

621
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:00,710
Speaking of her,

622
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:04,060
Rong Yao asked about this too yesterday.

623
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:07,750
He thought you two were too close

624
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,640
and asked me about your relationship.

625
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,020
There's no relationship at all.

626
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,250
There's nothing between us.

627
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,570
That's what I said.

628
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:17,170
I said, "Yuanwen is on a mission."

629
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,060
You know me so well.

630
00:39:21,790 --> 00:39:22,760
But you know,

631
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,340
your mission

632
00:39:24,910 --> 00:39:26,360
is to get close to Ou Zhenhai.

633
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,180
So in the future,

634
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,510
you'll have to deal with Ou Kexin.

635
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,670
From now on,

636
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,910
it's up to you to make decisions.

637
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:40,000
Have you figured out how to approach her?

638
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,120
I'll figure it out.

639
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,330
You're good.

640
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,230
You guys again?

641
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,590
Come on.

642
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:35,970
[From this operation,]

643
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,830
[we found a total of 70kg

644
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,070

[To us,]

647
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,490
this is not a victory.

648
00:40:51,410 --> 00:40:52,340
Think about it.

649
00:40:53,570 --> 00:40:56,600
There's 70kg of pure methamphetamine.

650
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,760
[In 1991,]

00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,220
Our Public Security Bureau,

653
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:06,200
in that year alone,

654
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,500
seized 350kg of methamphetamine.

655

[to find 70kg of drugs]

657
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:17,110
in a small garage in Yungang.

658
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,920
If this 70kg of methamphetamine

659

finds its way to Yungang,

660

how many lives would be ruined?

661
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,890
Being addicted to such a drug,

662
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,700
how many happy families

663

♫ Suddenly, I realized ♫

684
00:43:33,550 --> 00:43:36,850
♫ What we experience is love ♫

685
00:43:36,940 --> 00:43:40,500
♫ And time is my love confession ♫

686
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:43,970
♫ If love ever comes ♫

687
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:47,490
♫ It's the sweetest thing
I look forward to ♫

688
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:50,530
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

689
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:53,830
♫ Say goodbye ♫

690
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:59,110
♫ Let's promise to never ♫

691
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,550
♫ Say goodbye ♫
