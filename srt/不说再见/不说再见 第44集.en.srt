00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,700
[Episode 44]

3
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,009
We have an emergency now.

4
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:38,550
Tell me.

5
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,680
Skylark's identity

6
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:43,350
might have been suspected.

7
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,160
What happened?

8
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,340
When we came back,

9
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,560
Ou Kexin's caretaker, Madam Bao,

10
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,229
suddenly appeared at Mr. Ou's house.

11
00:01:56,370 --> 00:01:57,820
Her every move

12
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,670
seemed like she was testing Skylark.

13
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:03,020
If everything Mr. Ou said was true,

14
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,250
then Madam Bao must be there

15
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,270
because Glasses wants to expose Skylark.

16
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,970
But we haven't had a clue

17
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:11,460
about what's really happening.

18
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,620
I need you to look into it.

19
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:14,900
Okay.

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,480
I'll have someone look into it.

21
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,500
There's one more thing.

22
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:21,980
What's wrong?

23
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:25,370
I know who she is.

24
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,329
What do you mean?

25
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,850
I know.

26
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,840
You didn't tell me because of discipline.

27
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,950
You're afraid that if I find out,

28
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,230
I'll be too emotional

29
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,770
to complete my mission.

30
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,660
I understand.

31
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,420
I don't blame the bureau.

32
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,880
I just want to tell you

33
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,730
that I already know.

34
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,670
This will make things easier

35
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,680
for both of us.

36
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,490
Back then,

37
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,829
I failed to protect Rong Yu.

38
00:02:58,230 --> 00:02:59,200
I'm sorry.

39
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,580
Ever since Rong Yu

40
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,040
had the accident,

41
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,050
I haven't been kind to you.

42
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,270
I'm sorry too.

43
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,210
Yuanwen, if...

44
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:26,570
All right.

45
00:03:26,829 --> 00:03:27,930
We're both adult men.

46
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:30,790
Let's not keep apologizing to each other.

47
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,930
I promise you.

48
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,560
From now on,

49
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,540
I'll protect Rong Yu.

50
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:41,050
It won't happen again.

51
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,590
I'm looking forward

52
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,960
to finishing this mission soon.

53
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,730
That way, Rong Yu and I

54
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,970
can finally live happily together.

55
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:02,340
Then should you call me

56
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,010
like how you used to?

57
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,760
Stand still.

58
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:16,640
Attention.

59
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,339
What should you call me?

60
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,430
My brother.

61
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,310
[You finally picked up.]

62
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,110
What is it?

63
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,960
Matsumoto got caught.

64
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,590
I could've made it to the top.

65
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,610
But there's a fight inside Tiandao Group.

66
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,460
The police are also after me.

67
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,750
You need to help me.

68
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:12,260
It has been a while.

69
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:14,280
I don't think you understand my situation.

70
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,320
I've already retired.

71
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,300
Now, Mu Qing and Li Ruosheng

72
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,630
are in charge of everything.

73
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:23,830
How can I help you?

74
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,680
What do you mean?

75
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,440
Are you not going to help me?

76
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,150
Even if I want to,

77
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,170
I won't be able to.

78
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,640
-You...
[-The police are looking for you.]

79
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,270
You'd better lay low.

80
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,640
Don't call me again.

81
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,240
[Hey.]

82
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,340
Hey.

83
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,659
Glasses!

84
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,670
You left me first.

85
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,360
Don't blame me for doing this.

86
00:06:27,410 --> 00:06:28,290
Hello?

87
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,780
[Mr. Ou.]

88
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,210
Hello, Mr. Spectre.

89
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,690
[You finally answered my call.]

90
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:39,860
You misunderstood.

91
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,930
You're my golden goose.

92
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:44,040
Why would I ignore your calls, right?

93
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,280
[In that case,]

94
00:06:46,409 --> 00:06:48,880
[I guess we can arrange a meeting]

95
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,810
to talk about our partnership.

96
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,840
Take your time.

97
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,480
I'm sure you've heard

98
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,980
that my daughter hasn't been feeling well.

99
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,920
I'm busy taking care of her,

100
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,590
so I don't have time to see anyone.

101
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,000
Mr. Ou.

102
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,640
There's a limit to my patience.

103
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,370
I know.

104
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,700
You're occupied at the lab.

105
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,820
You're developing that new drug now.

106
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,110
It costs a lot of money.

107
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,400
This is a crucial moment.

108
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,500
Am I right?

109
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,690
You had other partners

110
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,060
because you wanted a better price.

111
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,350
Don't worry, Mr. Spectre.

112
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,430
I'm sure you'll like what I have.

113
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,950
But you have to wait until I'm done.

114
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,580
I'll call you, okay?

115
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,040
I believe you, Mr. Ou.

116
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,100
But I hope

117
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,730
you won't make me wait too long.

118
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,840
Even though Matsumoto went down,

119
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:43,520
I can still find another buyer.

120
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,320
Another buyer?

121
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,310
So what did you find?

122
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,830
Actually, I'm not so sure.

123
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:28,580
I'm not taking this lightly.

124
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:31,000
Everything makes sense.

125
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,809
She doesn't eat fish and peanuts.

126
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:37,110
The spot on her ankle is there too.

127
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,470
I don't know.

128
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:44,990
I feel like she's a little strange.

129
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:48,420
From her looks to her attitude,

130
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,920
she seems real.

131
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:53,790
But her temperament is different.

132
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,780
Her voice is a bit different too.

133
00:08:58,060 --> 00:08:59,290
I had taken care of Kexin

134
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,520
for so many years.

135
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,950
I know that much.

136
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,340
All right, Madam Bao.

137
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:17,420
Find a way

138
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,230
to bring her hair

139
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:22,350
and the cups she used

140
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:24,330
to me, okay?

141
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:25,950
Okay.

142
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,220
Okay, you can go.

143
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,040
Hold on.

144
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:36,070
Take the vegetables.

145
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,060
[Hello.]

146
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,390
Find a way

147
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,680
to look into the explosion

148
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:02,870
in France three years ago

149
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,510
that Ou Kexin was involved in.

150
00:10:26,890 --> 00:10:28,700
-Hello.
-You were right.

151
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,160
Glasses's men have been showing up

152
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,440
near a kindergarten.

153
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,640
We found that Madam Bao's granddaughter

154
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,780
goes to that kindergarten.

155
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,060
Hello.

156
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:38,110
Bye, Grandma.

157
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:39,700
-You're here.
-Hello.

158
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,150
-Hello.
-Let's go. Keep moving.

159
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,910
Come, let Grandma go.

160
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,620
Stop carrying him. Get down.

161
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,590
Say bye to Grandma.

162
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,780
Let's go.

163
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,320
-Okay.
-Okay, go ahead.

164
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,170
-Bye.
-Hello.

165
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,930
-Hello.
-Say goodbye to Grandma.

166
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,040
Excuse me. Let's go inside. Come on.

167
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:56,150
-Hurry.
-Bye.

168
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,210
Hello.

169
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,480
Come on. Keep up.

170
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,670
Come on.

171
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,270
[I think]

172
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,510
he's threatening her.

173
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,280
What's the plan?

174
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,610
Madam Bao holds the key
to this whole thing.

175
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,290
It's important to calm her down.

176
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:13,490
And we don't know what Glasses would do.

177
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:15,690
So don't act rashly.

178
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,230
We've sent someone

179
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,330
to stay with the hostage.

180
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,350
We also informed the local police

181
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,760
to keep the hostages safe.

182
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,560
Everything is under control.

183
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,720
Okay, I understand.

184
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:35,440
[Let every child have a good life]

185
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,270
Kids, get your toys.

186
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,290
Come on.

187
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,270
Put them in the box.

188
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,520
All right. Exercise with your teacher.

189
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:50,490
Go on.

190
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,680
Come on.

191
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,690
Put it here.

192
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,240
Little girl, you can't wear that either.

193
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,250
It breaks easily.

194
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,630
Go look for your teacher.

195
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,130
We have her granddaughter's bracelet.

196
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,450
Give it to Madam Bao.

197
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,090
Maybe she'll trust you.

198
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,000
Madam Bao.

199
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,870
Her bracelet?

200
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,160
This...

201
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,740
Madam Bao.

202
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,900
You've been taking care of me.

203
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,520
You're like family to me.

204
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,330
So I'm going to protect you.

205
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,130
I'll make sure no one can hurt you.

206
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:35,190
Do you understand

207
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:36,690
what I'm trying to say?

208
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,160
I understand.

209
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,500
I understand.

210
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,480
Are you sure

211
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,540
these are the photos from the scene?

212
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,130
Yes.

213
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,800
The French said

214
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,250
that based on the situation,

215
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,240
nobody could've survived that explosion.

216
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,780
Who do you think this Ou Kexin

217
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,800
really is?

218
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,400
I don't care who she is.

219
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:31,820
I just need to know

220
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,460
that she's a fake.

221
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,130
Sir, drink this porridge.

222
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,770
How is Kexin's recovery?

223
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,410
She's healthy and recovering quickly.

224
00:13:59,670 --> 00:14:01,690
She'll be fine in a few days.

225
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:03,540
That's good.

226
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,830
Thank you for taking care of her.

227
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:07,550
It's my duty.

228
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,630
I watched her grow up.

229
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:12,910
I probably know her better than you do.

230
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,600
Is there anything else?

231
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,970
Sir.

232
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,690
There's something I must tell you.

233
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:25,630
Are you telling the truth?

234
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,110
That's not all.

235
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,440
Actually, Glasses has changed long ago.

236
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,590
I just didn't have the evidence,

237
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,830
so I didn't tell you.

238
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:37,070
Only when I went to Country R

239
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,210
did I find out that

240
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,510
Mr. Glasses was working with Matsumoto.

241
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,760
There have been so many incidents

242
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:44,770
in the group lately.

243
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:46,790
Mr. Glasses has always had concerns

244
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,950
about Mu Qing and Li Ruosheng.

245
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,450
He's also dissatisfied

246
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,850
with me getting involved in this.

247
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,140
So he used this opportunity

248
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:55,460
and pretended to have retired.

249
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:57,180
But he actually made a new deal

250
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,410
with Matsumoto.

251
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:02,330
Then why didn't you tell me right away?

252
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,830
I didn't want to ruin

253
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,680
your many years of friendship with him.

254
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,010
Who knew what he would do?

255
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,120
He tried to use Madam Bao to hurt me.

256
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:13,980
If we keep letting him do this,

257
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,610
he'll try to hurt you.

258
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,030
That's why I have to tell you.

259
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:20,450
Before Matsumoto met Spectre,

260
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:23,930
he has actually bribed Mr. Glasses.

261
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:25,690
He promised to make Glasses the boss

262
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,320
on one condition.

263
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:29,250
He wanted Mr. Glasses to sabotage

264
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,700
our deal with Spectre.

265
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,200
Then naturally,

266
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,220
Matsumoto would have what he wanted.

267
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,420
He just didn't expect

268
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,140
that Mu Qing and I would go to Country R.

269
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,030
He was afraid of getting caught.

270
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,480
So he had Matsumoto's men

271
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,980
to try to kill us.

272
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,970
It's just all of his plans

273
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,780
were miscalculated.

274
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,710
Is all of this true?

275
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,700
Sir, think about it.

276
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:55,260
From Dakun to Tieguanyin,

277
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:56,710
and then Congtou,

278
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,080
everything that happened

279
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:00,670
was all related to Mu Qing.

280
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:03,350
Every time we suspected Mu Qing,

281
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,340
Ou Kexin would step up and save him

282
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,240
at the critical moment.

283
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,390
She would even go against you.

284
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:14,350
At first, I thought

285
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,850
she was just a young woman

286
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:17,830
and she liked Mu Qing.

287
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,420
But something felt wrong.

288
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,860
Only after I met Madam Bao

289
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:25,880
did I find proof.

290
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:28,390
This woman is very suspicious.

291
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:32,650
She's not the real Ou Kexin.

292
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,290
That's nonsense.

293
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,660
If she's not Kexin, who is she?

294
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:42,380
I'm suspect

295
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,190
that she's an undercover agent.

296
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,810
An undercover agent?

297
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:57,210
Glasses.

298
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,880
Are you out of your mind?

299
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,220
If you don't trust me,

300
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:06,270
we can ask Madam Bao.

301
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,450
Madam Bao!

302
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,440
Tell us what you told me earlier.

303
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:27,390
Actually, I came back this time

304
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,600
because Mr. Glasses forced me to.

305
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,630
He forced me to tell you

306
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,830
that this is not the real Ms. Kexin.

307
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,200
You're lying.

308
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,140
She's not Ou Kexin.

309
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,120
Be honest with Mr. Ou.

310
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:43,630
Sir.

311
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,530
He forced me to create an accident

312
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,760
to harm Kexin

313
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,400
and to say that she's a fake.

314
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:53,390
After Kexin's accident three years ago,

315
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,650
her appearance has indeed changed a bit.

316
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,160
But I've been taking care of Kexin

317
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,560
for so many years.

318
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,510
Even if her face has completely changed,

319
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,050
I would still recognize her.

320
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,020
Shut up!

321
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,080
Sir.

322
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,440
You have to believe me.

323
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,630
They...

324
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,920
They must have conspired against me.

325
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,680
She's not your daughter.

326
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:16,050
I know why you wouldn't let me go.

327
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:17,280
That's because

328
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:18,690
you never thought Mu Qing and I

329
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,280
would survive in Country R.

330
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,390
Are you scared

331
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,840
that I'll tell my dad

332
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,860
about all the things you've done

333
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:27,050
over the years?

334
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,900
You're lying.

335
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:30,350
I'm lying?

336
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,770
If I hadn't gone to Country R,

337
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,050
I wouldn't have found out

338
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,540
that you were involved

339
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,790
in the explosion in France

340
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,720
three years ago.

341
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,350
What?

342
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,380
What did you say?

343
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,760
Dad, I told you before.

344
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,100
Mr. Glasses made contact with Matsumoto.

345
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:51,080
It started three years ago.

346
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,880
Is this true?

347
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,030
No.

348
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,350
It wasn't me.

349
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:01,370
What she said is not true.

350
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:05,510
Fine, I have proof.

351
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,140
Call Li Tianlong.

352
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,460
Then we'll know if it's true.

353
00:19:13,030 --> 00:19:13,910
Dad.

354
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,100
Hello?

355
00:19:32,570 --> 00:19:33,450
Hello?

356
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:34,550
[Hello, Ms. Ou.]

357
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:35,910
[This is Li Tianlong.]

358
00:19:37,450 --> 00:19:38,680
Li Tianlong?

359
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,440
How did you get my number?

360
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,130
It doesn't matter.

361
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,340
The point is I want to apologize

362
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:47,750
for every bad thing I did.

363
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:52,060
I'm also giving you a big present.

364
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,730
And this present

365
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:56,630
will help you climb the ladder in Group K.

366
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:02,750
What do you mean?

367
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:06,010
If you promise me one little condition,

368
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,040
I'll help you get rid of Glasses.

369
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,650
You're in no position

370
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,750
to negotiate with me.

371
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:16,170
Ms. Ou, hold on.

372
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,530
After I finish,

373
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,900
you'll want to help me.

374
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,210
The explosion in France three years ago

375
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,440
was actually planned

376
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:26,030
by Glasses and Matsumoto.

377
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:28,090
[I just executed it.]

378
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,170
Explain clearly.

379
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,910
Your dad secretly sent you to France.

380
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,930
You could say that

381
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,990
you were completely out of his life.

382
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,060
If somebody close to Mr. Ou

383
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,690
didn't tell Matsumoto,

384
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,060
[how could we have known your location?]

385
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,720
[Glasses is like a greedy dog.]

386
00:20:48,550 --> 00:20:49,960
In order to take over Group K,

387
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:51,190
he has done everything

388
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,470
to try to kill Mr. Ou.

389
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,240
But he didn't dare to do it in China.

390
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,650
Because he knew

391
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,450
that if he had failed,

392
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,520
he would've died a horrible death.

393
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,730
[So he teamed up with Matsumoto]

394
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,670
[and planned this together.]

395
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:06,900
They thought

396
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,100
after your dad heard about your death,

397
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,820
he would go to France immediately.

398
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,360
[Then we could've killed your dad]

399
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,680
[in France.]

400
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,140
[But you were lucky.]

401
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:17,680
[You survived.]

402
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,280
So Glasses and Matsumoto

403
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,460
didn't succeed.

404
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,460
I don't know

405
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,480
if you understand me.

406
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:31,360
What do you want?

407
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,490
Matsumoto got caught.

408
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,350
In other words, you have no competitor.

409
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,380
Spectre will negotiate with you again.

410
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,720
I don't care how you'll negotiate.

411
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:44,260
I just hope

412
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,530
after you become the boss,

413
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,340
you can give me the authority

414
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,700
to sell the drug in our country.

415
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:50,420
That's all.

416
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,760
About that...

417
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,520
I have to think about it.

418
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:58,160
I'll get back to you.

419
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,110
I got it.

420
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:23,850
Come on.

421
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,070
Please.

422
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,110
It's okay now.

423
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:04,330
Sir.

424
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,490
It really wasn't me.

425
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:09,040
I didn't harm Kexin.

426
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:12,170
I watched Kexin grow up.

427
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:13,880
How could I have harmed her?

428
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,190
Glasses.

429
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,540
We've worked together for over 20 years.

430
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,420
I know that we can't trust anyone

431
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:27,870
in our business.

432
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,700
I think

433
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,770
I've never done you wrong.

434
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:37,380
Why did you try to kill me too?

435
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:41,070
Just these three years,

436
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:45,870
Dakun, Tieguanyin, and Congtou

437
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,670
were either dead or arrested.

438
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,430
All of it has to do with you.

439
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,900
I still put up with you

440
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,300
and kept you by my side.

441
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:58,940
Now, you're harming my daughter too?

442
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,980
How could you do this to me?

443
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:04,660
Sir.

444
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,600
I did all that for you and the group.

445
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:13,240
Congtou, Tieguanyin, and Dakun

446
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:15,130
were all up to no good.

447
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:17,150
They thought about
how to screw you over every day.

448
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,350
I've worked with you for so many years.

449
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,740
I've done all the dirty work.

450
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,340
The three of them

451
00:24:26,130 --> 00:24:27,450
got all the money.

452
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,820
I was nothing compared to them.

453
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,860
But I didn't mind.

454
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,150
I would rather be a dog around you.

455
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,790
That's because

456
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:41,750
I made a mistake and failed you.

457
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,430
So I'm telling you, sir.

458
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,200
This Ou Kexin

459
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,620
isn't your daughter.

460
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,480
She's an undercover agent.

461
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:53,760
Okay.

462
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,320
You keep saying she's a fake, right?

463
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,990
Tell me.

464
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,060
Where's the real Kexin?

465
00:25:04,230 --> 00:25:05,200
Sir.

466
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,370
Since it has come to this,

467
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,520
I won't make it out alive.

468
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,430
To repay your kindness,

469
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,950
I'll tell you everything.

470
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,410
[There's an emergency.]

471
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,310
[Lock onto my location.]

472
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,690
Captain Bao.

473
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:44,840
We have an emergency.

474
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,080
Let's go.

475
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,890
Three years ago,

476
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:55,970
I was the one

477
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,270
who gave Kexin's address in France

478
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:02,090
to Matsumoto and Li Tianlong.

479
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,860
This time,

480
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,500
when they were abroad,

481
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:10,180
I was also the one who told Li Tianlong

482
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,030
to harm them.

483
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,440
You're asking for it!

484
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:24,180
Sir.

485
00:26:25,190 --> 00:26:26,110
Li Tianlong

486
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,270
tried to kill them this time

487
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,170
because I gave him the order.

488
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,460
But...

489
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:36,850
this is different from three years ago.

490
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,510
You have to believe me.

491
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,260
I risked getting caught

492
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:49,340
to try to expose this woman.

493
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:54,180
It's because I found a lot of evidence.

494
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,940
She's an undercover agent.

495
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:01,880
You have proof?

496
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,640
Fine.

497
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,450
Show it to me.

498
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:09,580
This time,

499
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,440
I brought Madam Bao here

500
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:16,140
to expose her.

501
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,100
But I don't know

502
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,490
how they ended up colluding.

503
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,800
You don't know what's going on?

504
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,970
That's because you're talking nonsense!

505
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:31,930
Do you understand?

506
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,300
Dad!

507
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,860
Dad, stop it.

508
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,720
Mr. Glasses has been with you for years.

509
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,220
You can't kill him, Dad.

510
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,070
Sir.

511
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:45,840
Trust me.

512
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,060
You should kill this woman!

513
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,670
If you don't kill her,

514
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,840
she'll get you eventually.

515
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,110
You're still talking.

516
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,290
Dad!

517
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,390

00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:02,340
You were always scared.

686
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,150
A small crab could chase you around.

687
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,680
Of course I remember.

688
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:11,750
But I'm a grown-up now.

689
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,950
I've become bold. I'm not afraid anymore.

690
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:26,320
Dad, you've been fishing for so long,

691
00:37:26,450 --> 00:37:27,900
but you haven't caught a single fish.

692
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,180
Let's go back.

693
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:30,850
It's no fun.

694
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,940
I'm fishing for the experience.

695
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,060
I don't care if I catch a fish or not.

696
00:40:05,810 --> 00:40:06,690
Hello.

697
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,320
[Hello, Mr. Ou.]

698
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,460
Go ahead.

699
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:11,310
[According to the results]

700
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,420
[of the DNA test you've instructed us,]

701
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:15,930
[this person is not related]

702
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,740
[to the tooth you provided.]

703
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:19,540
[There isn't even the possibility]

704
00:40:19,630 --> 00:40:20,860
[of being relatives.]

705
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:23,100
[According to our investigation]

706
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:24,070
[in France,]

707
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,890
[the real Ms. Ou, unfortunately,]

708
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,700
[died in the bombing three years ago.]

709
00:40:30,190 --> 00:40:31,900
[We will send the test result]

710
00:40:31,990 --> 00:40:33,050
[to you later.]

711
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,230
[This Ou Kexin]

712
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,950
isn't your daughter.

713
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:44,930
She's an undercover agent.

714
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,660
[Every time we suspected Mu Qing,]

715
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:54,650
Ou Kexin would step up and save him

716
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,540
at the critical moment.

717
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:57,640
Dad, let me tell you.

718
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:59,230
Don't hurt your future son-in-law.

719
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,720
[If any of you hurt Mu Qing,]

720
00:41:00,810 --> 00:41:02,400
it means you're picking a fight with me!

721
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,410
Where is Mu Qing?

722
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:04,990
Where is Mu Qing?

723
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:12,820
[So...]

724
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,810
Kexin was there when that officer died?

725
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:17,350
Yes.

726
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,860
Why are you asking about Spectre?

727
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,580
I'm just asking.

728
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,690
Why are you overreacting?

729
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:24,790
Dad.

730
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,150
About Spectre,

731
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:28,090
I messed up.

732
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,070
Give me one more chance.

733
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,870
I'll make sure to get this deal done.

734
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:41,950
[I risked getting caught]

735
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,410
to try to expose this woman.

736
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:48,730
It's because I found a lot of evidence.

737
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:53,520
She's an undercover agent.

738

["The Place Farthest Away" playing]

739
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:09,670
♫ Against the light ♫

740
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:13,010
♫ Your vague silhouette ♫

741
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,740
♫ I reach out with my hands ♫

742
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:19,170
♫ But my hug passes through you ♫

743
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,090
♫ Maybe this is an illusion ♫

744
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:25,110
♫ A sweet dream ♫

745
00:42:25,910 --> 00:42:27,750
♫ Waiting for you ♫

746
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,320
♫ To notice it and wake me up ♫

747
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:33,610
♫ I wonder if getting close to you ♫

748
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:36,420
♫ One swirl will light up the stars ♫

749
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:42,890
♫ I wonder if someone
will tell you for me ♫

750
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:49,050
♫ At the place farthest away ♫

751

♫ Only then will the kites roam freely ♫

752
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,770
♫ If I gaze relentlessly ♫

753
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,980
♫ I wonder if there will be starlight ♫

754
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,970
♫ If the falling fireworks ♫

755
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:04,450
♫ Give me the sadness of being lonely ♫

756
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:06,600
♫ If your gaze gives me ♫

757
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:08,980
♫ A sense of direction ♫

758
00:43:09,070 --> 00:43:13,600
♫ I'll give you an answer too ♫

759
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:27,770
♫ Looking at your turbulent silence ♫

760
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,710
♫ I really hope you can understand ♫

761
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:40,130
♫ So I remain extremely quiet and gentle ♫

762
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:46,340
♫ Waiting for you to kiss my forehead ♫

763
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:48,840
♫ It seems you're in front of me ♫

764
00:43:48,930 --> 00:43:51,620
♫ Like the four seasons in my heart ♫

765
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:54,780
♫ Gentle and heart-wrenching ♫

766
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:57,910
♫ What can I say? ♫

767

♫ At the place farthest away ♫

♫ Only then will the kites roam freely ♫

♫ If I gaze relentlessly ♫

770

♫ I wonder if there will be starlight ♫

771
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,170
♫ Standing on your spot ♫

772
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:16,430
♫ Only then will I forget
the faraway place ♫

773
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,660
♫ Only your gaze ♫

774
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,960
♫ Can give me acknowledgment ♫

775
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:27,250
♫ Can give me an answer ♫
